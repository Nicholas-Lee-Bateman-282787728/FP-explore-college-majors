In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

1527616,2,B00005JNX0,"A group of lifelong zoo captives, buddies despite their hunter-vs-hunted natural relationship, arrange a prison break and try to find themselves, for better or worse, in the wild. Madagascar is a rough early effort from DreamWorks animation and, for the most part, it's a waste of vocal talent. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and Sacha Baron Cohen all chip in on a ho-hum plot that fails to hit either heartstrings or funnybones. The characters themselves are strong, a well-developed mix of distinct shapes and colorful personalities that would go on to blossom in later installments, but here they're mere saplings at the mercy of a flat, played-out storyline. Even the animation has aged poorly, playing more like a student's demo reel than a multi-million dollar major studio production. It's tempting to give that a pass, given how far technology has come in the ten years since, but Pixar had already released Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles by this time, and those all hold up wonderfully. An also-ran in all respects, it's got missed potential by the boatloads, but not much more.",1448323200,,1097,5.032967032967033

1528258,4,B00005JNX0,"""Madagascar,"" the DreamWorks CGI cartoon from 2005, breaks no new ground in animation, characters, or storytelling, but it is cute, and it's one of the Wife-O-Meter's favorite animated features.  So, I've watched it maybe half a dozen times, and it manages to bear up under repeat viewing.  Maybe it's the music; maybe it's the color; maybe it's the new Blu-ray graphics.  It is fun.

If ""Madagascar"" seems overly familiar by now, note that Disney made a similar picture, ""The Wild,"" just a year later.  Maybe the making of the two pictures was a monumental coincidence; maybe Disney saw how well received ""Madagascar"" was and decided to follow suit.  I dunno.  Lots of ""maybes"" here.  But imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I suppose.

""Madagascar"" features excellent (if not really innovative) CGI work, an appealing group of central characters, and some agreeable voice talents.  By the time it's all over, you get a pretty sweet message thrown in as well, so it works out to a pleasant experience.

The story begins in New York's Central Park Zoo, where we meet the movie's four main characters.  First, there's Alex, a lion voiced by Ben Stiller, an actor who seems to be in about 800 films a year these days.  Alex is an extroverted fellow who loves being the center of attention and the zoo's star attraction.  Marty, a zebra voiced by Chris Rock, is Alex's best friend.  Marty is a hip, wisecracking zebra, the equivalent of Donkey in ""Shrek.""  The two pals have been together for so long, neither of them realizes that in real life, the one would be food for the other.  Next, there's Melman, a hypochondriac giraffe voiced by David Schwimmer, and Gloria, a motherly hippo voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith.

Despite the pampered lives they lead, a few of the animals are discontent, bored; mainly, it's Marty and a group of penguins (their leader voiced by one of the film's co-directors, Tom McGrath) who resent having to sit and pose for audiences every day.  They want to go back to nature.  From this point on, by the way, it is the penguins who steal the show (""Just smile and wave, boys, smile and wave"").  Remember that it was around this time that penguins were so popular in the cinema, with this movie, ""March of the Penguins,"" and ""Happy Feet"" leading the charge.  Bearing this in mind, the penguins plan an escape to Antarctica.  The filmmakers mean them to be little gangster types, Edgar G. Robinsons and Jimmy Cagneys, so a prison break is in keeping with their little tough-guy personas.

Marty tries to persuade his friends to escape with him and follow after the penguins, but the others ignore him, prompting Marty to go off on his own.  When Marty's friends discover he's gone missing, they go after him to bring him back.  Zoo officials go after all of them and bring all them back, but it's too late.  After this incident, the zoo officials figure them for disruptive forces and decide to ship them off to a wildlife habitat.  The crate up Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins, and a few monkeys, and put them on a boat for Kenya.

But wouldn't you know it.  The penguins escape again and hijack the ship, knocking the crates overboard, where our four heroes wind up on the island of Madagascar, surrounded by its main inhabitants, lemurs, lead by their king, Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), and his right-hand man, Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer).

OK, that's the setup for the movie, and obviously it's a rather lengthy and convoluted way of getting the main characters into the wild.  The rest of the story, the bulk of it, involves the characters' misadventures in their wholly unknown surroundings:  a group of tame, spoiled zoo animals in a savage, untamed land.

A few of the gags in the movie will go over the heads of children.  For instance, there's a brief shot of Spaulding the basketball, a reference to Wilson the volleyball in ""Cast Away.""  Then there's an equally brief bit that will go over the heads of most adults with a book called ""To Serve Lemur"" and a character shouting ""It's a cookbook!""  (Think of early ""Twilight Zone"" for this one.)  Nevertheless, the inside jokes are funny, even if only the filmmakers and a precious few viewers may get them.

More important to the movie's success are the music, the graphics, and the friendships.  The music is a combination of the familiar (""Born Free,"" ""Candy Man,"" ""Stayin' Alive,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""What a Wonderful World."" and more) and the original (""I Like to Move it, Move It"" and a background score by Hans Zimmer).  The CGI artists stylize the graphics, so don't expect photorealistic animals; nevertheless, it is attractive in its amusingly cartoonish way.  And the friendship among the four principal players is sweetly touching.

Moreover, we can't forget the penguins.

Things get dicey when Alex really does start going ""wild"" himself, and then there are the Foosa, enemies of the lemurs who come periodically to eat them (shades of ""The Time Machine""), which could potentially be upsetting for the movie's youngest viewers.  But we have to remember that every good feature-length cartoon has had its scary moments from the very beginning of the genre with ""Snow White"" and its evil Queen.

While ""Madagascar"" may not be another ""Toy Story,"" it is an engaging little diversion that maintains its charm with repeat viewing, and its new Blu-ray trappings help enormously to keep our attention.

Video:
It's hard to fault the video quality.  DreamWorks engineers use a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC video codec to reproduce the 1.85:1 ratio picture with excellent results.  The colors are beautiful--deep, rich, and luxuriant--but never eye-popping or aggressive.  Sometimes, the image becomes a touch dark, but most of the time it remains bright and handsome.  When the animals reach Madagascar and its tropical rain forests, the picture really opens up and shines with gorgeous detail and definition.

Audio:
The box art says the movie comes only with regular Dolby Digital 5.1, but the disc actually contains a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.  Its strength is in its midrange smoothness and clarity, with just the occasional surround effect to remind us that it is, indeed, in five-point-one channels.  Most of the time, the audio is merely adequate, with a fine but not exceptional frequency range and dynamic response.

Extras:
As always with a DreamWorks release, we get a ton of extras on the disc, some of them in high def.  That most of them are awfully familiar is a curse of the system, I guess.  There don't seem to be too many ideas left for documentaries and featurettes and the like that we haven't seen before.  So, things here start off with a familiar audio commentary, this one with directors Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell.  Next up, there is a Blu-ray exclusive, ""Mad Trivia Pop-Up,"" little boxes that display additional information from time to time.  Then, there are the Penguins in a twelve-minute CGI short, ""A Christmas Caper,"" followed by about a minute and a half of ""Mad Mishaps.""  After those are ""Penguin Chat,"" wherein the Penguins give us about eight minutes of commentary on their scenes, and ""Meet the Wild Cast,"" seven minutes on the voice talents in the film.  Moving on, there's ""The Tech of Madagascar,"" five minutes on the CGI work; ""Enchanted Island,"" eight minutes on the real island of Madagascar and how it fit into the movie; and ""Behind the Crates,"" the longest item among the extras, about twenty-three minutes of behind-the-scenes making-of material.

Things conclude with a segment for kids called ""Learn to Draw,"" where kids can learn to sketch the animals in the picture; a music video, ""I Like to Move It, Move It""; a Video Jukebox of songs from this and other DreamWorks animated features; twenty scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  Or, if you're a penguin, the herring impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
""Madagascar"" doesn't have the big laughs of a ""Shrek"" or a ""Monsters, Inc.,"" nor does it have the heart of a ""Toy Story"" or ""Ratatouille"" (or a ""Monsters, Inc.,"" for that matter, which combines laughs and tenderness in equal measures).  Yet ""Madagascar"" does have its heart in the right place, and it does achieve a few small smiles.  It's a pleasant picture, with excellent voice characterizations and charming graphics.  I'm glad to have it around to watch again.",1434153600,,8449,4.898662913441239

1528742,5,B00005JNX0,What is delightful about this first of the Madagascar films is Alex (the Lion) becoming aware that he doesn't have to be moved by his instincts or even by his nature as a carnivore.  He CAN change! And especially for the sake of Friendship (for the sake of Marty the Zebra).  My granddaughter was impressed.  I love that the humor works for her and for me.

1529845,5,B00005JNX0,"The best part about this movie is how it's great for the whole family. I enjoy it as much as my 3 year old does.

Adults can enjoy it because the story is entertaining. It's a cute story about zoo animals who suddenly find out that they could be living in the wild. So they long for that life, only to figure out that city life is the life they love.

For the kids it's very colorful. The animals aren't scary. And the non realistic look of the animals (they are more angular than cartoons usually are) makes them non threatening and fun. They talk funny. They dance. And kids just eat it up.

It's a great movie for family movie night, no matter how young or old your kids are.",1402617600,5,678,4.1603053435114505

1529939,5,B00005JNX0,"It's not easy to explain my affection for this series, but I can very easily vouch my favorite of the trilogy being the original. This is more than capable of being a family laugh house from the excellent work done by the actors, the heart grabbing adorable lemurs, the originality of how Madagascar came to be, and all of its silly, ridiculous and rememberable heroes.

On a personal level, this really pleases me the most from having a strong adoration of the lemurs of Madagascar. I thank this film for drawing attention to their existence and likely throwing in aid to ensure their survival.

With all unique characters, a plot like no other and well drawn out jokes delivered every few moments, there isn't much more to ask from this masterpiece.",1397088000,2,751,4.7251908396946565

Marty (the zebra) decides the zoo life is not for him as well. Long story short, they end up getting boarded up and sent to Madagascar and have to survive on the island.

A Review of Madagascar
Jennie Stapay

The movie ""Madagascar"" has no, if any historical context, other than the fact that groups, like PETA, protest animals being kept in zoos. There are two directors for this movie: Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath. Darnell is known for directing all three movies of the Madagascar series (so far): ""Madagascar,"" ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,"" and ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted."" McGarth, as well as directing ""Madagascar"" and ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,"" also directed the movie ""Megamind."" The studio that produced this movie is DreamWorks Animation, producers of the ""Shrek"" series and ""Shark Tale,"" as well as ""How to Train Your Dragon.""
 The main characters in this movie are Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, and Gloria the hippo. The setting is the Central Park Zoo, Grand Central Station, a boat, and Madagascar. The main characters mistake Madagascar for the San Diego Zoo at first, because Melman proposes that the ""rocks are real,"" which means they just got moved to a different zoo. The quirky quartet gets to Madagascar by following Marty.  Alex and a large group, including Melman, Gloria and a bunch of monkeys chase after Marty, ending up at Central park Station. All four are discovered there and are tranquilized, and an animal rights group wants to put them back in the wild, ""where they belong."" The movie follows the adventures of the group on their journey.
 At the Central Park Zoo, Marty the zebra is celebrating his tenth birthday, but longs to see the rest of the world, not just the zoo, believing that he can find wide-open spaces to run around in, like Connecticut. Marty wants an adventure, needs an adventure, will have an adventure. Marty's best friend is Alex the lion, who attempts to cheer up his friend by singing Frank Sinatra's ""New York, New York"" with him. Still unsatisfied, Marty gets some tips from the zoo's penguins; Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private. Skipper is the head of the penguins; the penguins are not the head of Skipper. Similarly, the penguins, intelligent and sneaky, are also trying to escape the zoo. Marty's friends - Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe and Gloria the hippopotamus - realize Marty's folly and follow him. The four, along with the penguins and the chimpanzees, Mason and his silent friend Phil, eventually find themselves at Grand Central Station. They are quickly sedated by tranquilizer darts when Alex's attempt to communicate with humans is mistaken for aggression. The zoo (under pressure from animal-rights activists) is forced to ship the animals, by sea, to a Kenyan wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape from their enclosure and take over the ship, intent on taking it to Antarctica. Their craziness antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melmen, and Gloria to fall off the boat and wash ashore on Madagascar, because of the rocking of the ship. The animals are soon able to regroup, initially believing themselves to be in San Diego, California. Upon exploring, however, they come across a pack of lemurs led by King Julien XIII, and quickly learn of their true location. Angry Frustrated Alex blames Marty for their predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty, on the other hand, finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, with Gloria and Melman soon joining him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, though his hunting instincts begin to show; he has been away from the pampered zoo life of prepacked steaks for too long. He's no predator! The group is accepted by the lemurs, though King Julien's advisor, Maurice, cautions them about Alex's predatory nature. He cautions them to be wary; to be careful; to be cautious when dealing with Alex. King Julien ignores Maurice's concerns and persuades the group to help the lemurs fend off the fossa, who hunt the lemurs as prey. Neither bad weather, nor strangers, nor fossa keeps the lemurs from liking to move it. While initially Alex scares frightens the fossa away and is worshiped by the lemurs, he later falls under his instincts and attacks Marty. Realizing that Alex is now a threat to them, King Julien banishes Alex to the far side of the island, where the fossas live. Shocked, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo, seeing what Alex has turned into. The penguins, having been to Antarctica and found that it sucks, land the boat on Madagascar. Seeing this as a chance to return Alex to New York, Marty rushes after his friend against the wishes of the others. Marty attempts to convince the now grizzled, starving Alex to return by using the ""New York"" song but Alex refuses in fear of attacking him again. The penguins, Gloria and Melman go to find Marty, but are trapped by the fossa. By the last minute, Alex finally overcomes his predatory nature and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex and the penguins help him satisfy his hunger through sushi instead of steak. As the lemurs throw a bon voyage celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel and that they are still stuck on the island, setting the stage for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. This is the end.
 The theme of Madagascar is friendship and overcoming personal wants for the greater good. In the scene where Alex the lion overcomes his wanting to eat Marty, the zebra, he's demonstrating the theme of this movie. The other theme, friendship, is demonstrated by the quirky quartet when they stay together through the troubles that occur in Madagascar, as well as overcoming the fact that everyone has flaws.
 The director's and producer's purpose for making this film was giving the public entertainment. Another purpose is that it shows kids self-sacrifice. The theme can apply to your life, so if you're on ""bath salts"" and you want to eat your friend, you won't because you watched this movie and realized that eating your friend is selfish and not for the greater good.
 This movie was good--it had good morals, but crude humor. There are parts that refer to things of a sexual and crude nature, but that just flies over little kids' heads. If you do find that your child can make the connection between the phrase ""Hoover dam"" (with an emphasis on the ""dam"") and the word ""damn"" (used in a curse-like manner), you might want to have a long talk with them. Also, there is a scene where one of the characters spells out ""HELP,"" but the round part of the ""P"" falls so that it spells, ""HELL."" I recommend this movie to watch with your family, or if you're alone and want something childish to watch.",1339372800,,6730,4.831743278404163
1531037,3,B00005JNX0,"This is a thoroughly insane movie. A lot of fun, a lot of in-jokes, but completely insane. (People who know me understand that I mean that as a compliment.)

A lion, a zebra, a hippo and a giraffe are all friends who live in the Central Park Zoo in New York. The zebra dreams of living in the wild, which somehow he gets mixed up with Connecticut. So he breaks out and finds his way to Grand Central Station to try to get a train to Connecticut. His friends have to go and find him and bring him back before he gets in serious trouble.

Of course, this lands them all in serious trouble. They are to be shipped to Kenya. They are in crates on board a ship, stacked on the deck. But their crates fall overboard and they find themselves washed up on an island which turns out to be Madagascar.

Meanwhile, a troupe of penguins who were equally dissatisfied with the Central Park Zoo have hijacked the ship and . . . well, I did tell you it was insane, didn't I? Now do you believe me? It's a lot of fun, and the grownups will laugh their heads off at the subtle jokes while the kids have a great time on the broad and obvious ones. Just don't look for anything more profound than friends have to stick together. That and for a carnivore who hasn't had anything to eat for awhile, even his friends will start looking like thick, juicy steaks.",1336953600,,1339,4.22265625
1531038,1,B00005JNX0,"Open the movie, it comes with 2 DVD's and no Blu Ray!!!!
The package was not sealed as a new Blu Ray, it was secured with some kind of a seal(??)
I know it's not much money. but that was not what I was ordering.",1336089600,,211,3.7111111111111112
1531039,5,B00005JNX0,"My copy arrived with a Blu-Ray and a DVD just as the packaging and product description states.  I was worried when I ordered it that I'd receive two DVDs like other reviews described, but there was no issue here.  We love the combo movies because we leave the Blu-Ray as a family time movie, kept in adult hands, while the kids can use the DVD in their room or to take with them in the car.  It's great that so many family movies get the double treatment.

If you haven't seen this already, it is an entertaining kids movie that the adults will enjoy as well.  It's a ""be careful what you wish for"" and a ""fish out of water"" kind of situation for some zoo animals, some which wanted a taste of ""The Wild"" and others that were dragged along in the process.  There are plenty of laughs along the way and nothing here is particularly scary or intense.  The CGI isn't as dazzling as what the studios are doing in the present day, but it holds up pretty well due to the stylized look of the characters.

It's a nice price and a great way to get geared up for the upcoming Madagascar 3 that hits theaters this summer... and I'm sure we will be purchasing that one too when it comes out on Blu-Ray.",1334188800,,1191,4.215859030837004

1531042,5,B00005JNX0,Kids love this movie and adults laugh along with them.  The 2 disc combo is a great value.  Allows us to use the blu-ray in the house and leave the DVD in the car for travel.,1331596800,,174,3.8055555555555554
1531043,5,B00005JNX0,I just found out that this combo comes with 2 DVD's. It is advertise as a Blue Ray and DVD. So check it just in case. Too bad I can not return it because It's  very late for me.,1330387200,,177,3.5384615384615383
1531044,2,B00005JNX0,"This movie just isn't very funny and there's not much to the plot either. Animation is just OK. The lemur and penquin characters are relatively funny, but all the main characters just aren't. The movie fails to hold my 2 year old's attention for more than a few minutes, while he'll watch Finding Nemo and Toy Story in their entirety over and over. There are far better animated films out there for little ones and adults.",1329955200,,422,4.565789473684211

1531112,5,B00005JNX0,"My son ABSOLUTELY loves this movie. He cracks up laughing all the time. Mind you he is just 16 months. I've tried all different movies ranging from Disney classics to pretty recent movies like Toy Story 3, but he only likes this movie, Madagascar 2, and Monsters, Inc.",1325721600,,268,4.604166666666667
1531113,5,B00005JNX0,"AMAZING, They are the best, I really enjoy them. I always look for them when buying anything !! ! 5 STARS.",1323734400,,106,4.095238095238095
1531114,5,B00005JNX0,I'm excited to own this movie cause it's one of my favorite animated movies. Definitely entertaining and funny. I love it and the characters,1323388800,,140,4.875
1531115,5,B00005JNX0,"There is something so adorably manic about this movie that I can't help but totally love it.  It just continues to bring a smile to my face no matter how many times I see it (which is a lot considering my daughter's fascination with it).  The crude-like animation (it's pretty, but it's also clunky in an odd way) and the dead-pan humor add to the enjoyment factor because this feels like a perfect balance of adult and child entertainment.

Nothing will go over their heads, and nothing will fly under yours.

The film follows an oddly mismatched group of animals who form a bond while living out their lives in the New York Zoo (depicted as like the smallest zoo in the history of forever).  One of those `friends' is Marty, a zebra who loathes the confines of his `area' and dreams of running free in his homeland.  His best friend is Alex, the conceited and self-centered lion who is the prime attraction of the zoo, and he takes that rather seriously.  Gloria, the hippo, is soft hearted yet opinionated and Melman is a germaphobic and paranoid giraffe.  Together, they make a fun group who wind up being shipwrecked on the island of Madagascar after a botched escape plan lands them on a boat headed for Kenya that is hijacked by penguins and rerouted.

Yes, it's that kind of movie.

Once on the island, Alex becomes devastated and irritated while Marty soaks it all in like he's hit the jackpot.  Then, they meet the lemurs and the lunacy begins as their leader tries to use the island's new inhabitants as cyphers for the island's dreaded carnivores.

1531329,4,B00005JNX0,"I'll admit that I am a bit partial to talking animal CG animated features.  There is something about the personification of humans in highly stylized animal models that get me every time.  Plus the color pallets are usually spectacular.

That said Madagascar was on my ""to do"" list for a long time! 5-years to be exact (never let it be said I rush into things).  I did Disney's The Wild first and both Open Seasons but this one here I held off on figuring it would be the best of the lot.  Did it live up to my expectations? Yes and no.  The look was fantastic, some of the humor worked (others not so much), and the cast was spectacular (Ben Stiller nails it) but it wasn't the laugh-fest I had hyped myself up for 5-years.  But I digress; let's look at the facts, shall we?

Madagascar tells of New York's Central Park zoo where a showboating lion, a mid-life crisis suffering zebra, a neurotic giraffe & a bossy hippo do what they do in captivity each day.

Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) realizes that he will likely die within the confines of a cage and decides that he would like to see the wild after a depressing birthday party.

His equally pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) find themselves forced to escape the zoo as well (a zoo they just so happen not to mind) in effort to track down the runaway zebra.

Unfortunately, their attempt at damage control does little more than to persuades zoo officials that captivity is apparently not agreeing with these particular specimens.  They are hence tranquilized and shipped off to live out their years in an animal preserve in Kenya.

The plan may have worked too except that it turns out some escaped militant penguins have hijacked the ship in transit to Kenya and, as a result of their desire to check out their native Antarctica, get the animals' shipping crates detoured to the island of Madagascar.  The four unlikely protagonists suddenly find themselves in quite a predicament called surviving in the wild.

The plot is pretty tight (enough so for Disney to rip it off in fact) but the biggest flaw here is that the type of puzzle-piece perfection that has become commonplace in Pixar's blockbusters (and even many of DreamWorks') isn't present.  There is a bit of layered humor (the lion's appetite for attention, the penguins' platoon-like behavior, the chimps who are actually scholars and so on) but for every truly brilliant moment, there are an equal number of missed opportunities.  Not the least of which comes in the total miscasting of Jada Pinkett Smith as the giant hippo and David Schwimmer's inability to elevate what should have been sheer hilarity as the hypochondriac giraffe.

 Chris Rock and Ben Stiller create some natural chemistry however and truthfully, there is enough humor to compliment the unique visuals admirably.  With a brisk 86-minute runtime and a PG rating, the film often feels like it was actually designed to cater to adults over the younger set.

In conclusion I fear it's my own expectations that kept this one from earning an even higher rating.  A shame really because all of the pieces are present, it just lacks that little something that pushes this type of project over the top in terms of comedic genius.  As it stands, this one earns a solid 3.5 stars from your truly but since half star ratings are a no-go, I'll round it up to four stars (for the antics of the penguins and monkeys if nothing else).",1285545600,2,3511,4.691680261011419

It's collision of friendship and predator instincts makes for an unusually gripping conflict.

The most fun for me was the allusions to TV shows and old movies.  If you watched Twilight Zone and Planet of the Apes, even Chariots of Fire and Wild Kingdom, you'll know what I mean.  How many can you spot!

It would be a fun Lunch game to see how many allusions you can spot.

The story is  cute, kids will like it.  And adults will recognize a lot of music and movie allusions.  Great way to waste a couple of hours.  Can't wait for Madagascar 2.

1531925,2,B00005JNX0,"Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is having a midlife crisis.  He's tired of life in the Central Park Zoo and wants to see what life is like in the wild.  When he escapes, his three friends try to chase him down and bring him back.  And while Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) do catch up with him, it doesn't turn out quite as planned.  Instead, all four of them find themselves headed to Africa.  Will they survive when they get there?

I normally steer clear of Dreamworks Animation movies because I find them pale imitations of the Disney Pixar films they are attempting to rip off.  But the previews for the sequel looked so entertaining, I had to give this one a try.  I should have stayed away.

Yes, there are a few amusing moments.  I laughed at several of the movie spoofs.  But that was about it.  The story was boring.  The characters had so much potential.  Instead, they went with the easy joke (read bathroom humor) and didn't play out the jokes the premise could have set up.  As many have said, the group of commando penguins are the funniest things in the film, but they don't have nearly enough screen time to make much difference.

Then there's the issue of voice casting.  Yes, most of the cast did fine.  But I couldn't get Ross from Friends out of my head whenever Melman had a line.  Trust me, that was very distracting.

Many have dismissed Disney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild/dp/B000G75AZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild</a>&nbsp;as a rip off of this film.

I mostly watched it to see the song acted out and wasn't expecting much.  I made my sister watch it with me, my husband being out of town.

From the beginning, it seemed pretty clever and involving, but when they got to the island, it really picked up!  King Julian is hilarious!  My sister and I were laughing like loons.  When the movie was over, we watched all the extras, and then over the next few days, we talked and and laughed over our favorite scenes.  When my husband came home, we watched it again with him and laughed even harder and saw things we hadn't seen the first time.  This movie takes multiple watchings to get all the funny parts, because when you're watching the main characters, other, funnier things are happening in the background.  After we watched it with my husband, we went back and played our favorites scenes AGAIN.  Yes, it was THAT funny!  I love this movie and now I have to buy it.

1531927,5,B00005JNX0,"I must admit to not being a fan of the Dreamworks animations. They don't look particularly inventive, the voice talent is often at best distracting, or at worst, poor, and the stories are very sparse.  Madagascar really is no exception to the rule. We first meet the heroes of the film - the animals - at the New York Zoo. Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is a zebra bored with captivity and longing for the freedom of the wild. Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) is a vain yet cowardly lion, happy to pose for the public in his cage, and so full of himself that he buys Marty little icons of himself as birthday presents. Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac giraffe, while Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) is an earth momma, keeping her pals in check.  There is a also a small mafia of penguins in the zoo who want to go to Antarctica. These are funny and inventive characters, but a little at odds with the rest of the film.  This film has its moments - the animals going on the subway to Grand Central Station; the squirrels and chipmunks who rule the island of Madagascar (the wild Marty is so keen on); and the film and TV references - Hawaii Five O, Born Free, Chariots of Fire, American Beauty, and more.  But the characters are two-dimensional, the script is needlessly childish (yes, I know it is for kids, but give them some credit for having brains), and the film is pretty pointless, other than the same old 'you've got a friend' theme that pervades almost every film from the studio. The voice talent is just OK (and Ben Stiller in particular makes Alex irritating) and the animation is boring.  Not one I'd rush to see again.",1221177600,,1662,4.453947368421052

There are wild personalities, inane hijinx and cute cuddly animals. You know, the usual.

There are kids' movies that that reach out to the grownups too. Then there are kids' movies just for the kids, and maybe not for the brightest among them. This bit of fluff is one of the latter, unfortunately. There's nothing actually wrong with it - but there's nothing memorably right about it, either.

The fact is the movie was very smartly written. The animation was creative and very bright. It was realistic but abstract enough to be slightly amusing. The storyline is simple, but with a wide array of gags and ""physical comedy"" that entertains young and old alike. Of course, having said all that I must admit that the simple story is balanced by characters that are very complex in nature.

Alex is the king of the jungle... only his jungle is the city zoo. Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, along with lovely hippo, Gloria and Marty the laughable zebra make for an interesting zoo dynamic.

Throw in a bunch of oddball penquins with military delusions and a gaggle of lemurs that like to ""move it"" and you have the screwball hit of the year!

Most of these end up behind Pixar's creations as best cartoon of the year.  2005 was one of the few exceptions; first, Pixar did not release any movie that year.  Second, this movie is actually very good.  It tells the story of four overly domesticated zoo animals who inadvertantly end up in Madagascar, where they have to learn to survive against the odds and in spite of themselves.  The movie is written as a comedy with no romance or terror, and some action sequences.  As a comedy, it includes elements of sarcasm, singing, slapstick and a lot of outright stupidity.  Most of the jokes are original and appropriate for all ages, and the animation is quite believable and looks like a cross between the CGI wonders of Pixar and traditional cartoon drawings from the 1960's.  The voiceovers are great, and all the characters are excellent.  Most notable is Sacha Baron Cohen's first big role in a major Hollywood release.  Here, he is the king of a band of lemurs, and his experience from the Da Ali G Show shines through as he sings away in a South Asian accent.

1532242,3,B00005JNX0,"Madagascar is the story of 4 zoo animals in Central Park (a lion, a giraffe, a hippo, and a zebra) that find themselves, through various twists of fate, on an island in the middle of the ocean. No more cages, no more zoo. But also no more free food or people to take care of them. (Neither of those ideas is really examined all that much in the film, just briefly mentioned).

The animation is a bit blocky and the plot is a bit thin, but I'm sure it will entertain kids. The problem is that in this day and age we expect our animated films to do more than mindlessly entertain our children, we expect to be entertained as well. Unfortunately, Madagascar does not meet those expectations.

Despite the big names this animated film boasts (Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Cedric the Entertainer, Sacha Baron Cohen) the film feels a bit lackluster. That's partly due to the fact that none of these actors (Baron Cohen aside) know how to create a feasible character voice. These are name actors paid to sound like themselves. But a zebra with Chris Rock's voice is not entertaining, it's actually kind of annoying. The same goes for a giraffe with David Schwimmer's voice and a hippo with Smith's voice. Ben Stiller doesn't put forth much effort, but his lion, Alex, at least has a bit of character mixed in there. Sacha Baron Cohen definitely steals the film with his lemur-king Julien, but unfortunately he doesn't show up until halfway through the film.

The roll of the credits featuring Baron Cohen's Julien chanting ""I like to move it move it!"" is probably the most exciting and inspired part of the entire film. Although it's not a bad film, with all the other animation being made today, it's not particularly special.",1174867200,7,1753,4.666666666666667

1532405,3,B00005JNX0,"I moderately enjoyed this but am starting to be bothered by the tendency of animators to be content with creating films that 1) have no real story and 2) are built around whatever animal characters haven't previously been used in other films.  Though other films have had lions, few or none have featured zebras, hippos, and giraffes.  I can imagine the early concept planning sessions:  ""How about a gerbil?  Has anyone used them before?""  I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that they create the characters for these things first and then construct a story around them.  And that is the problem with this film:  they don't start by creating a great and compelling story.  Contrast this animated film with either of the SHREK films or THE INCREDIBLES.  The latter films have great stories.  Or going farther afield, contrast MADAGASCAR with any of the film by Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces.  Miyazaki's films are not merely brilliantly animated; they feature magnificent stories.

Despite not really having a story, the film is otherwise executed with the kind of panache and sheen that has become standard in the CGI-film.  The characters all look fascinating and are wonderful to look at.  Alex's mane, to cite only one example, with its hundreds of individually articulated strands of fur is stunning.  There isn't a frame in the film that isn't wonderful to gaze at.  And the voice over work and the individual jokes are marvelous to behold.  There just isn't a whole lot of story and what story there is arises from Alex's need to eat.

My worry with the contemporary Hollywood animated film, whether CGI or hand drawn (though virtually none seem to be hand drawn these days) is that increasingly story is being neglected for the design of the look of the characters, a long string of in jokes, and the background art.  SHREK had all of these elements as well, but also featured a strong story.  So, a truly intelligent animated film clearly is still possible.  MADAGASCAR features some good characters, lots of good jokes, and looks spectacular, but it just doesn't have much of a story.  I would gladly have given up a few of the jokes for even a halfway decent story.",1164499200,4,2177,4.811320754716981

The movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild', bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care.

Marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help' him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs. That's basically the whole movie in a nutshell. The group fight, Alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat. End of story.

The entire look of the 3D Animation was terrible as well. They should have continued with Shrek 3 instead of making this movie. It's pointless to watch.

The most interesting thing in the entire DVD was the `Penguins Christmas Caper', which wasn't the short movie itself, but the man who played Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is the polar bear.

1532470,4,B00005JNX0,"Described as an animated SEINFELD for kids, MADAGASCAR revolves around the lives of a quartet of animals from New York's Central Park Zoo. Marty (Chris Rock) is a zebra that after his 10th birthday suffers from a mid-life crisis and wants to be free. His closest friends; Alex (Ben Stiller) the lion, Melman (David Schwimmer--doing his best acting of his career) the giraffe, and Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) the Hippo try to get him to see how good their life is, but Marty just can't be convinced. He breaks out, as do the zoo's penguins, and tries to get to Africa. Instead, they end up on a Pacific isle somewhere that is largely inhabited by lemurs. The friendship between the quartet becomes estranged but faces the ultimate test when Alex (in an idea stolen from Bruce the Shark in Pixar's FINDING NEMO) begins giving into his carnal instincts and attacks Marty. Can a lion and zebra, two natural enemies, remain friends when they are no longer confined to captivity?

With that said, they real reason you want to see MADAGASCAR is because of the penguins. The penguins who escape from the zoo are a top-notch unit of military commandos. They seem to have been original put in the film for comic relief, but upstage all the other characters and are the real stars of this animated flick. Another secondary character worth mentioning is the lemur king, Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen). Cohen has been a popular comedienne only known to a small audience for many years. MADAGASCAR opened his talents to a wider audience and paved the wave for his further success as the villain in TALLADEGA NIGHTS. MADAGASCAR may become known as the breakout film for Cohen.

Though it's not quite on the level of a Pixar picture or the SHREK films, MADAGASCAR is better than much of the animated drivel that the studios are mass-producing currently. Children are sure to enjoy it and it has plenty of allusions and references as well as a decent soundtrack to keep adults entertained, too.",1161302400,,1973,4.766081871345029

1532567,4,B00005JNX0,"Over recent years, Dreamworks have produced a string of films aimed to entertain young children. However with the exception of ""Shrek,"" to the older audience, their films are somewhat lame and bland. But after watching ""Madagascar,"" for which I had low expectations, even I had to admit that Dreamworks did a mighty good job. I sat down with my younger sister (who I'll add ADORES this film) and I chuckled and smiled my way through this surprisingly charming Dreamworks success.

Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is an ambitious zebra who has spent the past decade cramped in Central Park's New York City zoo. Unlike his best friend Alex, who, ironically, is a lion (Ben Stiller), Marty dreams to live in the wide open spaces of ""the wild."" In the film's introduction we also meet Melmen, a giraffe who is a hyperchondriac (""Friends""' David Schwimmer) and Gloria, a self-assured hippopotamus (Jada Pinkett Smith). In an amusing twist of events, the four friends manage to escape the confinds of the zoo. To Marty's delight and Alex's sheer horror, they consequently land themselves on ship to a game reserve in Africa. In ANOTHER twist of events, they then become stranded on the island of Madagascar. The film then takes an interesting turn when Alex's carivorous instinct soon threatens his friendship with Marty, thus encouraging Marty to make the ultimate decision between his dream and his friendship.

I actually thought the storyline of ""Madagascar,"" was quite well-shaped and original. All animals, even those demosticated always carry with them those instincts and abilities that help them survive in the unforgiving wilderness. I want to really commend the film for their interesting exploration of this concept.

The film's story is accentuated and brightened by its child-friendly, yet pleasant humor. Stiller, Rock and Schwimmer are all renowned for their experience in comedy, which is evident through many of the film's amusing scenes. However, I didn't feel that the characters of Melmen and Gloria were given enough limelight. The film focussed a little too much on Alex and Marty's characters, and didn't explore the other two nearly as much. David Schwimmer's Melmen, I think, was the funniest character of the four, and so it would have been great if the audience saw more of him.

Unlike Pixar films, which are aimed to appeal across the ages, ""Madagascar"" is predominantly aimed at younger children, so naturally the gags were somewhat repetative. But this is hardly a bad thing. As I mentioned before, my nine-year-old sister simply loves this film, and she was in barrels of laughter throughout. For older viewers, although not to the same extent, there is certainly a charm that I found endearing.

Another aspect I must comment on is the film's abundant colour. I personally, am more of a Disney animation fan, however I am at awe at the vibrance and brightness of computer-animation, making it wholly appealling to its target audience of young children.

In conclusion, ""Madagascar,"" is not quite ""Finding Nemo,"" but I really did enjoy and chuckle my way through. With a surprisingly interesting and original story accompanied nicely with the comedic flair of its lovable characters, ""Madagascar"" is a film that with have the young ones laughing outloud and the older ones enjoying the colourful ride.",1152576000,6,3325,5.102941176470588

1532572,4,B00005JNX0,"There are sometimes where a good movie in the theaters can be fairly good, but there are other times where a animated film can miss the mark. That has been the case with films like Shrek, Toy Story, and other good films. What I saw about Madagascar featuring the voices of Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Chris Rock as the silly zebra, was at mostly good animated comedy. The story involves several animal friends and the longing of a zebra who wants to kow what it is like living the wild. When the zebra escapes, Mark the lion, Gloria the hippo, and Norman the giraffe try to go after the zebra, and then find themselves on a boat going straight to the wild. The animation for the film is absolutely delightful, but I just wish there could've been a bit more excitement in this film. It was just a bit too short.

1532573,3,B00005JNX0,"In ""Madagascar,"" four animals - a feisty hippo, a neurotic giraffe, an applause-addicted lion, and a freedom-yearning zebra - break out of their home in the Central Park Zoo, get crated up and shipped off to Kenya, and wind up stranded on the island of Madagascar.  While there, they have to adapt to a whole new kind of life in the wild, learning their place in the natural order of things, which is something they`ve been shielded from all their lives.

This is a bright, colorful, amiable film with likable characters, first rate animation and fine vocal work from the likes of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith.  The movie is at its best in the scenes set in Manhattan as the animals roam through the city streets causing terror and havoc as they go.  However, once they arrive back in ""the wild,"" the narrative begins to run out of steam, primarily because the writers have failed to come up with any compelling villain or foil for them to go up against.  There's fun to be had in watching Alex, the highly pampered and civilized lion, getting in touch with his long-dormant and supressed predatory nature, but it isn't enough to make the film much more than a mild diversion.

Still, the movie doesn't completely shy away from some of the more brutal truths of nature, without, at the same time, becoming too frightening or disturbing for impressionable youngsters.  It's certainly a lovely movie to look at, and that makes it at least tolerable for adults - impressionable or otherwise - as well.",1150329600,3,1533,4.719101123595506
1532574,5,B00005JNX0,"I thought this would be a stack of rubbish, having seen the preview which was on the Shrek video. We saw this with our kids at a friends house and immediately bought the DVD. Not only is it a great movie, but it has some fabulous extras.

The story is about 4 friends at the New York Zoo - Alex the lion, Melman the Giraffe, A Zebra and Gloria the Hippopotamus. The penguins escape setting up a longing in the Zebra for freedon, even at Connecticut. So he escapes one night to try to get to the wide open spaces of Connecticut, just for the night. alex, Gloria and Melman race off to bring him back, not knowing he was coming back on his own. However it goes horribly bad and they get bundled up to be sent off back to a wildlife preserve in Kenya. Only the Penguins make a break on the container ship first, taking it over and driving it to Antarctica. The sudden turn in the ship unsettles the load and the 4 friends float off in their containers, landing in Madagascar.

Wonderful animation, and hugely good-humoured. There is King Julian the strange 'squirrel' who is king of the Lemurs on Madagascar, they are all afraid of the 'foosa' who are some kind of feral lions. King Julian (voiced by the wonderful Sacha Baron Cohen aka Ali G) is fabulous, not only is the voice great, but so is the script.

The penguins are also a highlight, the voices are great, the animation is fabulous, and the script is wonderful for them. There are gorgeous little touches in this movie and the penguins have some of the best of them. Talking of special features, there is a nice little movie in the DVD special features of the Penguins at Christmas at the zoo - priceless!

There are some good special features on this, one of the best is if you flick the up switch over play a couple of penguins appear, click OK and see how the animation is made, how Alex's mane is animated, how they make animals run in sand, how Madagascar jungle is pasted together from a variety of different types of trees and so on. It is simply sketches set to music but it is wonderful.

This is such an appealing movie, it is fun for all ages and the DVD has several features which are also appealing to everyone.",1149465600,2,2181,4.33578431372549

The game on the dvd is fun for kids, and helping the penquins ""crack the code"" was engaging, though a little frustrating even for an adult. I am sure that some kids would give up on it.  I don't think we even found all the letters, just the first few and made a good guess.

1532822,4,B00005JNX0,"The animals of New York Zoo have a good life. They get food on demand and the public adore them, but Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) still pines for the wild. After a botched escape attempt lands him and his friends on a remote beach, the animals have to learn to fend for themselves. Striking a perfect balance between wit, slapstick and self-awareness, Madagascar is as fluffy as a meringue and twice as tasty.

From the moment that Marty bounds delightedly across the screen to the ironic strains of Born Free, it's clear that we're dealing with DreamWorks the minds that brought us Shrek. While the brilliant boffins of Pixar concern themselves with timeless stories, Spielberg's gang has always been about the jokes. The noisy, zeitgeisty attitude of DreamWorks' toons can be disastrous - witness the bloated bling of Shark Tale - but Madagascar hits the mark with all four hooves.

""PLEASURABLY DEVOID OF SENTIMENT""

Ben Stiller is on typically neurotic form as Alex, a friendly lion whose taste for steak sets him apart from his herbivorous pals, and there's good work from David Schwimmer as a hypochondriac giraffe. But it's the background detail that makes Madagascar roar, from the party-mad lemur tribe led by Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G), to a quartet of psychotic penguins. It's also a pleasure to see a cartoon so determinedly devoid of sentiment, a stance confirmed by the hilarious demise of an angelic little duckling.

The laughs come back again while the animals sing Marty Happy Birthday and a dozen other places culminating with him singing, dancing, and laughing all at once during ""I like to move it move it.""

Yes, at some point, we'll want him to stop singing ""you look like a monkey and you smell like one too"" at birthday parties.

And, I hope he's not still singing ""I live to move it move it"" in his teens.

On a slightly more serious note, we did have trouble the first few days after he first saw this getting him not to spit out beverages like the animals do in a couple of scenes. It's only funny in the movie, not at the dinner table. ;)",1141516800,,981,4.33879781420765
1532829,4,B00005JNX0,"""Madagascar"" must be a very maddening movie for young kids who go with their parents, because at moments when they are not laughing their parents very well could be and the kiddies will have no clue why.  After all, how many pre-teens have seen the end of the original version of ""The Planet of the Apes,"" the beginnings of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Chariot of Fire,"" or have even heard the theme song from ""Born Free""?  I expect they may have seen ""Castaway"" and might well recognize a homage to the dancing hippos from ""Fantasia,"" but is it reasonable to think they saw ""The Twilight Zone"" episode ""To Serve Man""?  I realize that when kids are laughing they probably are not aware of what their parents or guardians are doing, but since they will not be laughing at most of these pop culture references to other films, they may well be awrae that the older people are watching a different movie.

Ultimately the problem is that the different ""Madagascar"" that the grownups are watching is clearly funnier than the one that is trying to keep the wee folk entertained.  The story is about four animals who are best buds at the Central Park Zoo.  Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is the star of the show and a devotee of raw steak, while Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is tired of looking at the fake jungle painted on the wall and longs to be free in the wild, not really knowing what that means.  Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac, worried about the brown spots on his skin, while Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinikett Smith), is a rather contented soul.  But when the quartet of penguins decide to make a break for Antarctica, Marty gets out on the streets of New York City, which forces Alex and the others to rescue him.  Their trip to Grand Central Station is seen by the humans as a quest for freedom and against the will of three of the four friends, they are crated up and put on a ship bound for Africa so they can be happy (the humans who come up with this saw the movie ""Free Willy,"" but never read the news stories about what happened when the star of those films was released into the ocean).

To say that they end up in Madagascar rather than Africa might seem like a minor distinction since the island is off the coast of the continent and therefore part of the same land mass, but it is important that the place is NOT Africa.  Africa is a place where there are prides of lions, herds of zebras, and so forth.  Madagascar is a place where there is a division between the lemurs and their small friends, ruled by the wacky Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen), who is advised by the more sedate Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer), and the hyenas, who do not talk, following the tradition of really bad animals in movies populated by talking animals (e.g., the rats in ""Lady and the Tramp"").  This matters because it makes the newcomers the biggest animals around (the ""New York giants"" to the locals), and Alex a true king of the jungle (he terrifies the hyenas when he is not trying to and Julian wants Alex to try really hard to terrify the hyenas).

""Madagascar"" is an anti-""Call of the Wild"" in that the biggest conflict becomes not the ability of the zoo animals to survive in the wild or to save the lemurs from the hyenas, but rather keeping Alex from converting to his natural state in which case Marty and the others are literally the walking steaks he misses so much.  Few friendships can survive one friend sinking their teeth into the butt of another, and the tightrope this 2005 animated film must walk is that we have to fear that Alex is going to eat the rest of the cast.  But then we remember, to adapt the wise words of Chandler Bing, that this would just mean they stop drawing the zebra.  However, it is hard to complain about the rhetorical aspects of a film whose chief message is that you should not eat your friends (I bet small kids would get the idea that film is the anti-""Silence of the Lambs"").

Seeing animals like a zebra, a giraffe and a lion behave like people is always funny, especially when voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and David Schwimmer (who was funnier then I would expect). On Madagascar it's Sasha Baron Cohen (Ali G) who steals the show.

The animation is perfect, never have seen animals move in such a way.

Another very funny thing are references to other movies like Planet of the Apes, American Beauty and the Matrix.

The only thing is... the story is flimsy, there is really not that much happening. If you read other reviews you will have a very good understanding of the story, it's really sad that such great animation has been made for such a flimsy storyline.",1140134400,7,728,4.627906976744186

Madagascar is a film about friendship, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, integrity and inner strength.

Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT!

In short, Madagascar is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek movies, Antz, and Monsters Inc.",1139961600,,1146,4.973821989528796

The Film is a simple enough concept, covered well in other reviews. But the packaging of the DVD is a masterpiece. The Menu is entertaining. The Main Commentary is technically enlightening, but not entertaining. The so-called Penguin commentary is actually labelled  Penguin  chat, and should have been feature length; and I REALLY  hope that the Penguins return somehow, since they are the standout gems, and are clearly aimed at an adult viewership.

There are a few funny moments throughout, and the pack of lemurs are fairyl entertaining, but there really was no story at all, and the animation wasn't all that great compared to recent features.

When Marty gets the bright idea to escape to the wild--in CT--his pals run out to find him. The plan backfires when they get caught and shipped out to Africa.

What ensues is a series of part madcap and part philosophical adventure, giving fresh meaning to ""the grass is greener on the other side."" Kids will enjoy the film while learning that the things you wish you had aren't always what you want.

The computer animated graphics are nicely done, including a fun, whimsical piece when Alex gets tranquilized at one point.

It's not the greatest film ever made, but it certainly is worth getting for kids of kindergarten age and up. Younger children may enjoy it, too, for the animal escapades.

He then enjoys watching them...over and over and over again...as I'm sure many more experienced parents are certainly aware of.

So, the big question is: can an adult watch this 30 times in the space of a month, and not go bonkers?

The succinct answer would be: yes.

No, it doesn't approach the zippy genius of Pixar's best efforts, but there's a lot to like, a lot to see, and a lot to appreciate.

The vocal cast is fine...and the angular design of the animals is necessary to distinguish this from the typical Disney figures.

The backdrop of Manhattan is lushly depicted, as is the African jungle. Repetitive viewings will allow you to note artistic details that zip by the first dozen times.

While the plot is no great shakes, the dialogue is actually pretty good. It's fast enough that you'll find new lines every other viewing or so. It took me about twelve screenings to decode the zebra's exclamation ""Sugar! Honey! Iced tea!""

1533139,5,B00005JNX0,"This is what happens when you choose top talents all around to make an animated film:  you get a tight story, likeable and distinct characters, great dialog and a quirky but state of-the-art look.  What's more, the adults as well as the kids are entertained.  All this and more went into the making of Madagascar.

Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) are fast friends in a New York zoo.  We presume they have lived there all their lives because it's obvious that none of them are aware of the natural order of predators and prey.  They are also every bit the pampered New Yorkers that any celebrity humans of the city are; they live on schedules, customized diet plans and adoration.  For the most part the animals are quite content with their urban lifestyle, except that is for Marty.  He dreams of what it would be like to run free in the wild - or at least his fantasy version of the wild that he gets from zoo murals and publicity ads.  So one day, he orchestrates his own escape just for the heck of it, and his friends must follow in order to, uh, save him.  It was a disaster all around, but it got the attention of animal rights nuts, which ended in all of the animals heading on a ship for a wildlife preserve in Africa.

To make a long story shorter, the penguins had plans of their own and they hijacked the ship for Antarctica.  The four animal friends were jettisoned overboard accidentally and then drifted off course to the island of Madagascar (which they mistake for the San Diego Zoo).  This is the setup for some of the funniest misunderstandings and comedic moments of the movie.  Was the wild everything that Marty was hoping for?  Can Alex get over the loss of his star status now that he has competition from a lemur king - and more importantly, where is he going to find a steak in this freaky new place?  And, will Melman and Gloria be able to keep them all out of trouble?

As far as I am concerned, Madagascar is the best family film since Toy Story 2 (which my kids watched nearly every day for a few months, once upon a time.  I know, it's just horrible of me!:).  Everything was superbly done, from the big name stars' voices on down to the minor characters', the design of the animals, landscapes, etc and the little details that went into the animation. The humor worked through dialog jokes on the adult level (but never inappropriately) and visually for the kids.  The whole experience had LOL moments and a sense of fun and delight.  And of course it was impossible to resist the adorable but not syrupy lemurs and penguins.  I can honestly not find one thing to fault or criticize about this movie - splendid job!

Dvd extras include interviews with the cast and creators, which I found fun and interesting.  Madagascar is without a doubt one for your permanent home collection.  Enjoy.

I won't go into the story as you can read about it yourself in these reviews, but I will tell you there were so many fun things about watching it that I'm still smiling.

The storyline is great, the soundtract oustanding, visuals bring every activity to life, animation supurb and the characters are a chuckle a minute.  My top favorite, ""GLORIA, the hippo."" Why is it that I believe I know some humans that remind me of Gloria.

1533218,5,B00005JNX0,"Don't believe the Disney-fed knuckleheads who've panned this movie. This movie is funny on many standards. First of all, it's made by DreamWorks Animations, and not Disney-Pixar. Since it's not Disney, you don't get the corny formulaic singing and dancing often seen in Disney animations put just to pimp soundtrack sales.
What you get is a cleverly written (and animated) movie that my kid absolutely loves and I enjoy along with him. Grown-ups can enjoy the pop-culture references such The Twilight Zone spoof, and Alex the Lion doing his best G-Rated impression of Charlton Heston from Planet of the Apes. If you're good with the pause button, you can also catch many subtle cookies left behind by the makers of the movie. For example, when on the ship, as the penguins are about to take over the bridge, the logo on the captain's shirt says ""S.S. Act II"". Why? Becuase the Act II of the movie is just starting then.

  The plot isn't really anything new: Marty the Zebra wants to leave his life at the zoo and live in the wild, but his friends want to stay put. THere is a little bit of conflict between the Zebra and his LIon friend, but it's trivial and almost stupid.
  When this movie was finished I was left with a feeling of ""Okay, that was a big waste of time."" My brother loved it and I'm sure other little kids will find it funny, but for me it just didn't work well at all.",1137974400,4,675,4.090909090909091
1533220,3,B00005JNX0,"I'm one who misses the grandeur of traditional cel animation.  However there's something to be said about a cartoon that (unlike most past releases) doesn't really try so hard to push a moral lesson into you.  ""Madagascar"" is one such film.  I can't remember the last animated feature film that was made just for pure entertainment.  Sure, you can say it's about how friendship conquers all, etc. etc. but when it comes right down to it, ""Madagascar"" is just all about fun.  And yeah, for the lack of finding more proper words, it's just plain cute.  The film is about a bunch of animals who have grown up in a simple New York zoo.  One animal, Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) longs for the chance to run around in the wide open wild.  His three friends, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer), and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith), try to make him realize that he's living a good life in the zoo where they are, this reviewer notes, excessively pampered extravagantly.

A bunch of penguins successfully break out of the zoo in the hopes of reaching Antartica.  This prompts the zebra to realize that he could visit his wild roots and he breaks out of the zoo.  His three friends break out as well in the hopes of returning him to the zoo, but this is seen by us simple-minded humans as a sign that the animals desire to return to their natural habitat.

One mishap leads to another in the process of their return to the wild and they end up in a mysterious island where they meet a tribe of party-happy lemurs led by Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen) who, with his aides Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and Mort (Andy Richter), reveal that their tribe is under threat by the carnivorous feline Fousa.

Cohen steals the show from the entire cast whenever his character, King Julian, is on screen.  He even overshadows such intimidating personalities as Cedric the Entertainer, who just feels lackluster or out of place in this film.  Disappointing is Andy Richter as the Gizmo-lookalike Mort.  I'm a fan of Richter since the Conan O'Brien show, and I know he's capable of better roles than this.  Mort sure is cute though.  :)

Nevertheless, the film was animated with as much care as any recently put out CGI film.  And the cast seems to have had a genuine ball with their roles.  This shows onscreen and what we have is a purely entertaining romp of family fun.",1137801600,,2396,4.590588235294118

Suprisingly I liked it.  Normally I am not a Ben  Stiller fan but he did a good job as Alex the lion.  Chris Rock did well as Marty and David Sshwimer was good a Melman.  Jada Pinket was ok but her character only did so much.

Overall the best characters were the penguins and the Lemur King; especially when he sang the ""move it move it"" song.

It's a silly film and you might have to explain some things to your children especially if they are young.  My 4 year old thought there were lions, giraffes, zebras and hippos on Madagasgar(she wanted to go there to see them :) ).

Overall the humor is well done and there are references to other films throughout the movie.  For example the Twilight zone episode ""How to serve man.""

I will again mention the Penguins as probably the best part of the film.  They alone are worth the price of the DVD.

It was a thoughtful gift, since my daughter loves animals, and we go to the Portland zoo often, where she falls in love with all the animals all over again.

My daughter would probably give ""Madagascar"" five stars . . . but then, she's 2.

""Madagascar"" isn't a bad movie per se.  It's just that it is as unsatisfying as one of those summer blockbusters that you go to thinking you're going to see another ""T2,"" or ""Die Hard,"" and you suddenly realize you're watching ""The Phantom.""  Just disappointing.

On paper, ""Madagascar"" should be great.  The vocal talents are full of recognized names -- Chris Rock as a freedom-loving zebra, Ben Stiller as a lion with a need to be loved and a submerged carnivore streak (he only belatedly realizes where steak comes from), David Schwimmer as a wimpy giraffe, and Jada Pinkett Smith as a voluptuous hippo make for an interesting headline.

But these folks, as talented as they are, fall flat. You can almost see Ben Stiller reading his lines in the studio, and Chris Rock, bless him, is poorly suited for this saccharine role.  (If anyone ever makes a rated 'R' Pixar-type movie with harsh language and biting satire, Rock should be the first actor signed, but here he's more hand-cuffed than when he hosted the Oscars.)

Without giving too much away, the plot of ""Madagascar"" is fairly simple.  Several animals in the Central Park Zoo in relative tranquility, and Alex the Lion particularly loves being the centerpiece of the entire production.  But Marty the Zebra has turned 10, so he's in the middle of a mid-life crisis -- the zoo is great, but is that all there is (and is this really a plot kids can relate to?).  Marty tries to escape to ""the Wild,"" of Connecticut, but this escapade and his friends' botched attempt to save Marty deposits the friends on the ""wild"" island of Madagascar.  Of course, when they get to Madagascar, the animals learn that life without room service is much more challenging than they thought.  (This difficulty is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the zebra, apparently, is capable of building colossal shelters out of bamboo and fronds, complete with sunlights.)

There's also the subplot about the carnivores and the herbivores learning about the whole ""circle of life"" the hard way.  It's hard for lifelong friends to hang out when they learn that one of them is supposed to, you know, eat the other one.

The City Animals also run into a bunch of lemur-like creatures, who are led by a most-annoying king Julien who has a most-annoying tendency to speak in malapropisms and to sing hip-hop doggerel.  (While my two-year old daughter loved ""I Like to Move it Move It,"" all the adults in earshot found this song considerably annoying after its first appearance.)

""Madagascar"" should make us sit back and reflect on just how majestic both Shrek and the Pixar family of films (""Incredibles,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" etc.) are.  These movies transcend their genre of computer-generated cartoons and qualify as great movies in their own right.  These stories are inspired by a great deal of wit as well as respect for the story-telling process. ""Madagascar"" is a purely routine movie with a big-name cast spinning out a less-than-inspired storyline.

The DVD for ""Madagascar"" is much better than the movie if, for nothing else, the Christmas special featuring the movie's beloved squad of penguins.  I didn't mention the penguins earlier, because they deserve separate treatment.  If the entire movie had been about these commando birds, ""Madagascar"" would have surely been a five-star effort.

All in all, ""Madagascar"" is fine if you've got younger kids, but check this one out only after you've exhausted the Shrek movies and the entire Pixar library.",1135641600,,3878,4.882442748091603
1533426,1,B00005JNX0,"I strongly recommend NOT purchasing Madagascar. There are so many good CG and non CG animated movies out there with such better plots, storylines, characters, etc. Madagascar just stunk. And the reason it stunk is because Dreamworks was so interested in showing off their technical brilliance with so many unnecessary and unconnected asides and distractions from the plot that when the movie returned to the plot I was tired from trying to make sense of how the scenarios were related even to each other and not just the main storyline. Pick any Pixar movie and you'll find it more compelling than this Dreamworks movie. Don't get me wrong me and the family like some of the Dreamworks movies - Shrek, Shrek 2, Kung Fu Panda (which is TOTALLY AWESOME, we own and watch it often) and Aliens vs. Monsters. Like Dreamworks, Pixar also shows off their technical brilliance in all of their movies (esp. in HD - whoa!), but the difference is that one is not distracted from the storyline, plot, character development. Often this brilliance is an integral piece of character development, plot development, story movement, camera angle, etc, that enriches an already strong story. Madagascar did not deliver for us. The characters were just this side of one dimensional. If you don't care about the characters in a story (any story) it isn't a story worth telling. I, as well as my fourteen year old son (both of us looooove animation and are connesiurs) agreed the only redeeming quality of this movie were the penguins and enjoyed the second short movie involving their efforts to save their compadre when he gets into trouble at Xmas time, but don't buy it for that, either.",1135555200,9,1669,4.859649122807017
1533427,4,B00005JNX0,"This is the story of four friends, best friends who just happen to be animals. Alex the Lion who's spoiled with grooming and precut steaks; Marty the Zebra who loves his life but yearns for some more, Melman the hypochondriac Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo who acts as a surrogate mother to the other three. From the beginning we see how spoiled these friends are with their every whim filled by their caretakers.

They end up packed in crates bound for a African preserve after Marty decides he wants to see ""the wild"" and goes out wandering in the streets of New York. This probably wouldn't have been so bad were it not for his friends deciding to go save him. Lions roaming the streets are a little more serious than Zebras. I didn't appreciate the humour of the NY cop asking his boss if he could shoot the Zebra. Because of unforeseen circumstances they end up severed from the ship, floating in the ocean and finally landing on a tropical paradise.

Like any movie there are scene stealers. In this case, it's the four military trained penguins that also have their own Christmas short in the features area. Another scene stealer is an itty bitty lemur named Mort who has Puss-in-boot eyes and a nervous giggle.

Obviously not true to life;  the gates are low so the animals can get to one another or at the crowds but then it's not every day you can hear a Zebra, Lion, Giraffe and Hippo talk, dance and sing. Great fun for kids but if the adults are looking for fun they'll only be mildly amused. As always the graphics are great, the music is toe tapping and there is humour. There are a few minute frightening scenes when the animals realize they are not in a Zoo anymore and cute cuddly little beings are being eaten by bigger not so cute ones but this is really short. There are a few other sad/dark points but overall it is a fun movie.",1135209600,,1848,4.426470588235294
1533497,2,B00005JNX0,"It's a shame this movie was below average. The animation was very good. Like Shark Tale, it had it's moments, but it didn't work as a movie. Dreamworks seems to have the problem to accommodate the actors with the characters instead of the other way around. Did the zebra really have to look like Chris Rock? Please.  Ben Stiller was uninspired as was Ross from FRIENDS. Again Like Shark Tale, the actors ruined the movie. The story had potential but ultimately fell flat. The only good Dreamworks production was Shrek Two.

I know there is always the comparison between Dreamworks and Pixar but Pixar is by far the better company. Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters, Inc. all have two things going for it: imagination & great story telling. They don't have to rely on second rate comedy to get laughs unlike Madagascar.",1134950400,6,848,4.761904761904762

1533500,5,B00005JNX0,"In the animated movie Madagascar, the wild is a symbol of freedom.  Different characters have different prospective on this because for Marty it is very much wanted, and because Alex, Melmen, and Gloria on the other hand like the city life. Furthermore, the penguins feel that the animals do not belong in a zoo but in the wild where they came from.

 I watched this movie because I enjoy seeing computer animated movies.  My little brother just got it so I thought what a great opportunity.

 Marty really wants to go to the wild to run free. He feels his life will always be the same if the stays at the zoo.  ""I just eat here, then there, then stand over here, and then over there!""  Marty told Alex. He is always daydreaming while running on his treadmill inside his exhibit while he stares at the mural on the wall by his exhibit.  During his birthday he wishes that he could one day be free to run in the wild.  The rest of the gang thought he was crazy.

 Alex, Melmen, and Gloria do not want to go to the wild for a number of reasons.  Alex, for example, is the main attraction at the zoo, and if he went to the wild nobody would care about him, see, or admire him.  Melmen is a hypochondriac and in the wild he would not be able to get all his special medication he would get if he stayed at the zoo.  Gloria is a hippopotamus so she just likes to relax and eat all day, and what better place to do that in than in a zoo where everyone takes care of you.  There are some other animals in the zoo that have a whole different idea, like the penguins.

 The penguins have this crazy military mentality. They think that the zoo and everyone else in the world is against them.  They are always trying to escape. They think that animals do not belong locked up in cages but free to roam the wild where they came from. Their main objective in the movie is to return to Antarctica and be free.

A bunch of zoo animals being transported in crates fall off the ocean liner and wash up on the island, Madagascar (this is off the coast of Africa and is an island rich in exotic wildlife).  Naturally they think it must be deserted, lots of squabbling goes on between the animals and they set put to see what they can find.  My favourite character is the giraffe played by David Schwimmer, the giraffe is a drip, albeit a funny one!

One minor detail, but I don't think it is any reflection on the movie makers... my son is 3 and found the scenes with the tiger quite terrifying -but then he found the tiger in Ice Age terrifying too!

They make you forget that the plot line for the feature is limited at best, with (cout'em) 6 sceens worth watching! If writers spent the time and effort on the movie as they did with the featurette and the dialogue for the Penguins, this would have been a true classic. It's as if I was watching two different movie's one in which I did not care if they got home and one in which I care very much so.

The thing that sets the ""Madagascar"" DVD apart is its extras.  Not only does it have the requisite ""making of"" featurette and the much-ballyhooed Christmas short starring the military penguins, it also has various features that even include a game of ""Whack-a-Foosa.""

1533626,3,B00005JNX0,"I was not that interested in seeing this latest animated DreamWorks concoction until I saw an 11-minute short, ""A Christmas Caper"" just before the wondrous Wallace and Gromit feature, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". In expertly rendered computer animation, it starred four physically adroit penguins who not coincidentally steal the feature-length film from which they originate. At 86 minutes, ""Madagascar"" has several entertaining scenes, brightly colored images and a kinetic pace that doesn't flag, but somehow the film falls short of the Pixar features to which the creators seem to aspire. A lot of it has to do with co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath trying too hard and co-screenwriters Mark Burton and Billy Frolick cramming a lot of story within its comparatively brief running time. They provide some sharp lines and winking references to other movies, but the movie lacks an ironic punch that would have made it truly memorable.

The plot focuses on two animals, best friends in spite of their different species - a curiously dissatisfied zebra named Marty, who dreams of what life must be like outside his admittedly comfortable digs at the Central Park Zoo in New York, and an egocentric lion named Alex, who enjoys the limelight at the zoo but comes to terms with his natural tendencies amid the wilds of the jungle. It is both a blessing and a curse to have Chris Rock and Ben Stiller provide the voices for Marty and Alex respectively.  While they provide some expectedly funny moments, their motor-mouthed presence makes the film pretty exhausting to sit through without fidgeting, especially as Rock seems to be imitating Eddie Murphy's Donkey in the ""Shrek"" series. Neither seems to be directed to develop characters but rather magnify their personalities. Faring marginally better on the sidelines are Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria, the no-nonsense hippopotamus, and David Schwimmer in Ross Geller overdrive as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe.

Once the setting moves to the Rousseau-like tableaux of Madagascar, the movie improves considerably with the addition of comical lemurs in thrall of the crate-wrecked visitors -  Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G, plays the hilariously despotic King Julien XIII with a heavy dollop of Indian curry, Cedric the Entertainer is the put-upon Maurice and Andy Richter makes the saucer-eyed Mort sound like the first cousin of a Spielberg gremlin. There is even a nod to the actual ""Born Free"" movie not only in the use of the theme song in the opening but in a relatively somber sequence that has Alex coming back to his natural tendencies among the feared fossas to the increasing fear of his lifelong friends. But the movie's brightest spots are provided by the four penguins (voiced by members of the crew) and two erudite monkeys who are used mostly as transitional cues in the story.

The DVD has a fairly standard set of extras, though I liked the alternate audio commentary track provided by the penguins. The deleted scenes, ""Mad Mishaps"", are fairly incompressible for their deletion other than the fact that they aren't in finished form, and ""The Tech of Madagascar"" is quite dry as is usual for seeing the mechanics behind computer animation. For the kids, there is the video for the inescapable ""I Like to Move It, Move It"" song by the lemurs and video games galore, as well as ""Enchanted Island"", a genuine educational featurette on the real Madagascar.",1133740800,,3433,5.069026548672566

Coming in close second were the Lemurs.  Buy this movie just to see the King Lemur do a version of the Robot Dance.  It's pretty awesome.  Also their rendition of ""I Like to Move It Move It"" song!

The animation is stellar.  Most of the actors did well.  I especially liked the hippo.

The problem, I think, lies in Ben Stiller's voice work.  I  really don't think that he is much of an actor.  However, I must admit that he is a much better actor than I am.  Richer too, come to think about it.

There are some interesting movie references.  Some of them are pretty strained and not at all funny.  For example, if I see another riff on Charlie Heston and the Planet of the Apes, I think I'll scream.

In any case, this is an enjoyable picture.  It has adult jokes.  It has kids jokes.

1533755,3,B00005JNX0,"Long ago, before this movie was even in threaters, I saw some commercials for it and I admit that I was excited. At the time, Pixar was kicking ass and taking names. They made some incredible animated movies. Not merely that, but other companies were getting in on it and I enjoyed some of the other companies' efforts, such as Ice Age.

So I thought that maybe Madagascar would be as enjoyable. In the end, it wasn't nearly so, but it is still fairly good.

The main problem with this movie is that it isn't immersive. What made Pixar's creations so enjoyable was how well you could feel the characters' emotions. In Madagascar, however, the movie allocates far too little time to character development for this to occur.

For example, the two main characters of the movie is Alex and Marty. We know that Marty is unhappy with his condition at the NY zoo, but Alex and the others seem perfectly happy. Why is this? What is giving Marty these emotions of emptiness? He experienced the same thing that his friends experienced because they're together all the time, so what set in these emotions for Marty? What kind of personality does he have that allows him to have these emotions?

And this is exactly what I'm talking about. You never discover the personalities of the characters, not even the main characters. Instead, the directors gave them generic emotions. We all know they love each other and they wouldn't purposely hurt each other, but we don't know what makes them run. We never discover what lies deep inside of them, what makes them who they are.

Of course, however, I may be attempting to find depth in a movie that was created merely for entertainment. Pixar may have spoiled me with the unbelievably well crafted Finding Nemo.

Anyway, though, to get to the point, I do enjoy this movie somewhat. Unlike most who seems to like the penguins, though, I actually like the interaction between Julien, Maurice, and Mort the most, though. I personally thought that was the high point of the movie.

1533837,4,B00005JNX0,"""Madagascar"", like most of the Dreamworks animated movies, is a kitchen-sink hodgepodge. The good news is that this hodgepodge is better than anything I've seen from this outfit, and that includes both ""Shreks"". Kids will love these truly funny animals, while their moms and dads will get a boot out of bits that spoof everything from ""Seinfeld"" (a major influence on this movie) to ""The Twilight Zone"".

  The first section of ""Madagascar"" is set in New York City, where the four ""zoosters""- Alex the lion (voice of Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith), and my favorite, Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer)- are the stars of the Central Park zoo and pampered beyond belief after the kids go home. One day, Marty decides to escape the zoo and take the train to the wilds of Connecticut. Ever see a zebra in Times Square? A giraffe on the subway? A lion emerging onto the concourse at Grand Central? Some clever animation brings old-time ""Looney Tunes"" tricks to the computer era as our heroes, cornered by a hundred of New York's finest, wind up in crates on a freighter, Kenya-bound. Soon, the Four Penguins- the unsung stars of this movie- start one of their wiseguy capers and hijack the ship. The four crates fall off the boat and, ""Survivor""-style, wash up on the beaches of what they assume to be the San Diego Zoo- but it's really the huge island of Madagascar, where they interact with a merry band of lemurs led by goofy dancing King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen, aka ""Ali G"")

and his skunk-like sidekick Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer).

  That's the story, such as it is. The movie, however, doesn't have the well-defined characters and themes that, in my mind, Pixar will always do best. What it does have is a dizzying array of slapstick gags, a ""Friends""/""Seinfeld"" dialogue rhythm (at least in the NYC portion), quickie skits that touch on old TV shows (Marty surfs onto the beach to the strains of the ""Hawaii Five-0"" theme) and other movies (Alex talks to a soccer ball, ""Cast Away""-style), and similar touches that will definitely tickle your funny bone. More than almost any computer-

animated movie I've seen, ""Madagascar"" tries- and largely succeeds- to create what its crew calls ""more cartoon-y gags and characters"".

  A good array of extra features include not only interviews with the voice cast and director/writers, but a look at the ""stretch"" effects that, in the words of one animator, are

""very difficult with computers"". They're especially good on anything involving Melman, the lovably-neurotic, pill-popping giraffe. The best extra, however, is ""The Penguins' Christmas Caper"", which brings the four birds front and center in a very funny holiday tale. Tom McGrath, the ""Madagascar"" co-director and writer, also voices the penguins' leader with a very amusing New York cop-style sneer. Musical selections could be a little better- veteran Hans Zimmer's best contribution is a pulsing lion-show theme for Alex- but the use of pop/theme cues does get a little heavy-handed. I loved the penguin short's music, though:

two nifty ""Jingle Bells"" takeoffs by Brian Setzer (swing-a-billy)

and the Brave Combo (klezmer-ized!). As for the voices, Stiller can be overbearing and smug, while Rock seems to be a little tentative. But Schwimmer, having played a sub-Woody Allen role on ""Friends"" for ten years, has his lovable-mope bit down pat. Baron Cohen's peculiar Euro-Indian accent can grate, but I loved his greeting to the American visitors: ""Hail the New York Giants!"" Finally, there's a look at the real Madagascar and how the filmmakers replicated some of this distant island nation's one-of-a-kind fauna and flora. (Incidentally, you couldn't see ""Madagascar"" on Madagascar- its capital city has a million people and only one movie house!)

  ""Madagascar"" may be a Dreamworks pastiche, but it's a pretty good one. Animation buffs, New York comedy fans, and kids who love funny animal characters will all find something to laugh at.",1132531200,2,4012,5.054545454545455

A Zebra (Rock) wants to go out into the wild when he finds out the psychotic Penguins are gonna try to escape from the zoo to go to Antartica, so he busts loose and his animal friends, A Lion (Stiller), A Hippo (Smith) and A Giraffe (Schwimmer) go after him but they get caught, along with the Penguins and Monkeys and are shipped off back to their mainland. But then, the Penguins take over the ship making The Lion, The Zebra, The Hippo and The Giraffe go over board and wind up on the sandy beach of Madagascar where they meet Lemur friends.

Marty wants to go to the wild and escaped and his friends try and stop him and they get sent to Kenya but the oenguins turn the ship around and the four friends get hurled into the ocean and land on Madagascar.

The penguins were cool and the monkeys were chucklers with their poo jokes, but I think the lemurs steal the show personally.  Sacha Baron Cohen was funny as King Julian and Cedric the Entertainer was good as Maurice.  This movie spoofed a couple of others and there are some tongue in cheek jokes that kids may not get but adults will think is hilarious.

I have a great idea for a movie people, check this out.....Take all the supporting characters from all these movies (Donkey from Shrek, Dori from Nemo, the penguins from this, the Jamaican characters from Shark Tale, Mr. Potato Head from Toy Story 1 & 2, the crazy squirrel from Ice Age) and give each and every one of them there own movies, cuz' most of them are all better then the main characters they are ""supporting""

Anyway, enough of that, back to the movie. It seems Marty the Zebra (Decent vocals by Chris Rock) wants to go back to the wild, and he and his 3 buddies get carted up and get shipped away on a boat. Of course they somehow fall overboard and end up on this island (Madagascar) There they fall in with some Lemurs and Foosa's (Still not sure what the hell these were) while trying to avoid becoming lunch from Alex the lion, who is a good lion, but is seeing everyone as steaks, cuz' the poor guy is missin' life at the zoo!!!

Ben Stiller actually overdoes it as Alex the lion, he is non-stop chatter and it gets kinda annoying after a while, shut him up and let the penguins have some more screen time. David Schwimmer is the Giraffe, nothing special here, maybe a few funny lines when he is stuck in his crate, but that's about it. Then there is Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria the hippo, completely useless and really not needed in this movie at all, very few lines, even fewer funny or even decent lines, get rid of her so our penguins can have some more time!!!!!

The chemistry between any of these animals is not very strong, Alex and Marty are supposed to be best friends but ya don't feel it, the animation is decent, not at a Shrek or Nemo level, but still fun to watch.

The positives? Gee, what do you think I'm gonna say? OH HELL YEAH!!! THE PENGUINS BABY!!! they absolutely steal the show, every scene they are in is hilarious, problem is, they just aren't in it too much. They are military in everything they do and the jokes never stop coming and all of them work. Towards the end they are sunning themselves on the beach deciding wether or not to tell our heroes that the boat they think is going to get them home is outta gas, gotta love it...

Here is what you do, when you get to the main menu, scroll until you find the penguins short movie called ""Christmas Caper"" watch that, it's better then the movie and ya don't get those other 4 animals.......

acting.....2.5 stars, Too much Stiller and Pinkett-Smith
directing....3 stars, Maybe a little generous, some fun too be had
special effects....3 stars, Lemur dance scene is awesome
comedy rating....2.5 stars, Some good laughs, some not so good

1533843,3,B00005JNX0,"In the campy computer animated film Madagascar a quartet of zoo animals find themselves pondering and experiencing the meaning of life and the social context of life.  It is an interesting idea to contemplate that what a zoo animal would think, if they existed outside of the fences of the zoo.  However, several studies have shown that animals that have grown up in captivity run a great chance of extinction once released into the wild.  Nevertheless, animated comedy tries to apply the notion of setting free tame animals into the wilderness, which offers an amusing rollercoaster that throws pies and pulls the chair from underneath the audience with a myriad of silly slapstick moments.

Several computer-animated films that have received a blockbuster release such as Toy Story (1995), Shrek (2001), and The Incredibles (2004), and sequels have also driven in a large chunk of money.  Most CGI animations have been exceptional in their narratives, thus why not make another animated film with the help of computers.  However, Madagascar lacks some of the brilliant storytelling that has gone hand-in-hand with CGI films.  Unfortunately, most of the film tends to build on previously applied humor, and an exaggerated amount of slapstick humor.  After awhile the silly tripping and slams in the face become an uninspiring event of repetitive thinking and mere time fillers in the featured film.

Despite the negative aspects, there is still some greatness within the film, as the four animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) begin their journey into the unknown.  The caricature of the quartet is terrific, as the Alex superego emerges in the gifts he gives his friends and the overwhelmingly hysterical hypochondriac Melman.  The best part in the film is the four scheming penguins that are on a mission to return to the snowy widths of Antarctica, and the meeting with Sacha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Ali G's lemur persona King Julien XIII.

The story opens with an amusing dream sequence where Marty dreams of his personal paradise in the wilderness, as he is racing towards a small lake.  Alex, who also chased him in the dream, shatters this dream.  It is an amusing comparison between the dream and reality, as Marty's reality consists of having a lion as a friend while in the dream Alex was chasing him.  Furthermore, it suggests the idea of a twisted sense of reality that Marty and the other zoo animals possess.  To broaden the concept of twisted reality, it might serve as an analogical perspective of humanity's la-la land vision of life's permanence and the idea of existential safety.  However, this is to stretch the artistic process of the computer-animated zoological journey into an intellectual domain, which illustrates a number of interesting concepts in the light of Darwin where the strongest survive.

Marty decides to make his dream reality, as he escapes to explore the world.  Actually he intends to explore New York and maybe a little of what lays beyond the city borders.  However, his three friends intend to find him and return him to the safety of the zoo while they all are unaware of humans true feelings of wild animals, in particular lions.  To their dismay, they learn that they are returning to Africa, as society deems that they belong in their natural habitat.  However, after an accident relating four penguins involved in a large ship hijacking, the quartet lands on the beaches of Madagascar.  Several different emotions flush through them such as anger, fear, panic, happiness, and hope, as they try to get their bearings on the life in the wild.  It is amusing to see how they handle the new situation, as they mostly appear like people visiting a foreign culture.  The quartet's narrow-minded comments to King Julien and his entourage is compared to Californians having a P. Diddy party, which is understandable as it is all they know.

Ultimately, Madagascar delivers comic relief to both young and old, even though this film will most likely be more entertaining to the younger viewers with its high level of slapstick humor.  Compared to other recent films with CGI animation Madagascar does not succeed in delivering an equally impressive storyline, yet it clearly finishes above an average cinematic experience.  There are both hits and misses within the story.  It is obvious that it will entertain an audience, but it misses a story with thorough substance from beginning to the end and it hurts the overall cinematic experience.",1132099200,2,4588,5.023778071334214

1533936,3,B00005JNX0,"UPDATE - Jan. 2007

Well, you never know...

A while after that first viewing (described in the review below, from September 2005), this movie came on cable, so I taped it ""just in case."" Well, it feels a bit different on the small screen, and our kid liked it -- although some reassurances were still needed at first to get past worries about the biting, clawing, and so on.

By the second or third viewing, we were all enjoying it about equally, and the inherent ""violence"" of the food chain had been accepted because our child was a bit older, and had learned more about science, nature -- the circle of life, so to speak.

I still do not think it is appropriate for most kids 5 or under, but now that time has passed, we like this a lot more than we did after that first movie viewing, and we've watched it frequently. One finds a lot of details on repeat viewings that one misses the first time, and there are plenty of jokes that work different ways for adults and kids. By the party music during the final credit roll, we are all dancing!

I'm leaving the original review intact, because it was an honest assessment of the film at that time, and a description of a real experience.

----------- ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS -----------
""Reasonable entertainment one time but not worth owning""

I saw this in a theater full of five-year-old kids at a birthday party. If ever there were a setup for a great response to a movie, that would have been it. Well, the movie started, then went on... and on... the kids didn't laugh much and hardly moved except perhaps to squirm in their seats. The movie would get going occasionally, the kids would respond, then the story would drop to low gear again. Yawn.

Sure, there were high spots of interest, and our kid particularly liked the King Lemur and his silly song and dance. But none of the main characters made a true, lasting impression on our child, nor were we asked for Madagascar toys afterward. THAT is a real indicator, I think.

We have toy lions, giraffes, hippos and zebras -- and when playing, our 5-year-old never reassigns them to play the characters in this film. By contrast, the lion toys are often used to act out ""The Lion King"" for one good example. If Madagascar had really made an impression, we'd have seen it being re-enacted at home. But it never happened.

I'm a huge fan of Chris Rock, and I like Ben Stiller. I wanted to see this movie succeed not just because I like those performers, but also because as parents, we can always use another good kid movie for the home collection, to stretch out the repeats of other stuff we've watched a zillion times. But I do not think this one fits the bill.

Parents of young kids should note that PG rating. Yes, folks, there really IS a difference between ""G"" and ""PG"" and the PG means your kids are depending on your guidance for what they see. This film is a little rough around the edges with some mildly scary violence, crass jokes and so on. Other reviewers always mention the penguins, but frankly I think most young kids will not get that humor at all. The stuff the penguins do is funny to grownups, but kind of mystifying to little ones.

The setup -- the animals wanting to get out of New York -- will also make a lot more sense to older kids and adults than it will to young ones. The ""humor"" revolving around captive animals having to adjust to life in the wild? Kindergartners can understand stuff like that if you talk about it, especially when applied to real animals and so on. But I do not think they can pick up that this problem is a motivating plot force in this movie.

The animals are escaping from the zoo, yeah, and that's easy to grasp. But this is not just about escaping. This movie is about four characters learning how to return to a natural existence, and how to keep their relationships intact in the process. If that sounds HEAVY, well, you're right -- it is! I don't think the producers really understood what film they were making, or that the theme described above is too subtle and intellectual a concept to serve as the foundation for an animated comedy.

And some kids will probably be a little wigged out by the way Alex, the natural carnivore who never had to hunt when he lived in the zoo, struggles not to turn his friends into a meal as he gradually adjusts to the wild life on Madagascar. In other words, the change in these relationships makes sense to adults, but might confuse and bother a young child.

Maybe older kids might dig this more. Maybe not. As for parents who think this is better than Shark's Tale, I totally disagree.

For a long time, I tried to avoid letting our kid see Shark's Tale when it came on TV, because I thought it would be too violent and that the humor might be too adult. One night we ended up watching some of it by accident, and our child was fine with it, to my great surprise.

All the mafia jokes in Shark's Tale were completely over the head of our five-year-old, of course. But the writing was so ingenious that those scenes still worked great for a kid's film. It had a clearcut, obvious story, with a clearcut, obvious central character, who has a clearcut, obvious plot resolution. And it has physical humor that is carefully paced throughout the film, in ways that keep kids attentive.

Madagascar has none of those things. And as much as I like the actors in this film, the voice work does not come ANYWHERE NEAR that of Shark's Tale, or most other good animated films that you might consider. Many parents will want to like this film for reasons I've already mentioned -- but I really believe that its creators were thinking like adults -- not kids -- when they wrote it and produced it. A good children's movie has to be *charming*, not just hyperactive. This one, unfortunately, lacks that charm.",1132099200,3,5803,4.4636449480642115
1533937,5,B00005JNX0,"MADAGASCAR is a delightful animated film from the makers of SHREK.  Although the leading roles are entertaining and effective, the movie is stolen by the quartet of penguins and the gallery of lemurs.  These guys are what really makes the movie so enjoyable.  The animation is brilliant, and there is some clever in jokes parodying CHARIOTS OF FIRE, PLANET OF THE APES and other movies.  There are some delightful tunes as well.  The main voices are supplied by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith and David Schwimmer, but its those hilarious penguins and lemurs that make the most lasting impression.  The four penguins are like undercover covert operators and the lemurs are just whacky and whimsical.  Little Mort (voiced by Andy Richter) is as Gloria the hippo says, ""Cute enough to dunk in my coffee.""  The movie has a slow start in the zoo setting but once the guys get to Madagascar, its a real hoot.  Children should enjoy the movie; its innuendos and off color humor will more than likely fly fight over their heads, but adults will enjoy this gem as much as the kiddies..I did!!

I like Ben Stiller most of the time and Chris Rock and David Scwimmer was perfet for the hypochodriac giraffe, but it seemed forced.  The penguins were funny...as were the lemurs.  It just felt middle-of-the-road for me.  I usually enjoy animated movies with my kids (we own every Disney DVD) and I did enjoy this one, just not that much.  Kind of a disappointment.  See for yourself.  Maybe I was just tired, but I doubt that.  I know funny and it did garner a few chuckles from me, but this is not knock-down-drag-out funny.

Since parents will have to watch this film anyway, I would say to them that there IS some good material here. The penguins steal the show, and their antics take up a good bit of the film, breaking up the boring bits with the principle characters. The Lemurs, especially King Julian, are also pretty funny.

The DVD comes with all of the extras that families have come to expect from Dreamworks on their animated DVDs. A number of games are available on the disc, but the best game is the one hidden behind the Penguin ""Code"" puzzle.

The disc has secret clues which, when entered into a special screen, unlock the best game on the disc! This game is a sort of puzzle maze where kids can guide the Penguins around a giant ship until they get to the control room and take over. The code you need to play this game is pretty simple to guess at, even if you don't search every menu for the codes. There's even a hint button on the code screen.

1534038,3,B00005JNX0,"Really, we've seen all of this before, and done better.  CGI in an of itself is no longer enough to intice the families into the theatre.  The huge success of ""The Incredibles"" was not in the excellent CGI work, but in the fact that the story could have worked just as well with live actors.  Good script, good dialogue, and good acting really do make a difference.

However, the studios that churn out these CGI vehicles on a regular basis don't seem to have noticed this.  They think that if you get some big-name talent for your voices, throw in a little slapstick, some toilet humor (for the under-10 crowd) and some hip pop culture references (for the parents slowly dying in their seats), then you have the makings of another blockbuster.  Certainly this movie ultimately will show a modest profit for the investors, but if I recall correctly, the box office results can be charitably described as tepid.

When we watched it, the kids were, at best moderately engaged by the movie.  They've seen enough CGI so that it is no longer a novelty.  There just wasn't enough in the movie itself to hold their interest...the characters were either uninteresting or annoying, and the storyline meandered too much to hold their interest.  Suffice it say that the adults would have rather been doing anything else than enduring this.  Echoing other reviewers, everyone liked the penguins, but that is hardly a recommendation for the movie as a whole.

I would not consider buying this movie, as I doubt the kids would watch it more than once.",1131580800,2,1537,4.7368421052631575

1534040,4,B00005JNX0,"Jameson Thottam: Animation Review of Madagascar

We've now reached the point in the CG cycle where we no longer ask ""Is it as good as Pixar?"" The new question regarding computer animation movies is ""Is it better than Shark Tale?"" And considering that ""Madagascar"" is the next CG family comedy from DreamWorks, after the aggressively unpleasant ""Shark Tale,"" the question takes on a little more relevance. Two ""Shark Tale""s in a row would be a sign of even worse things to come. So it's with much relief and a mild thumbs-up that I assure you: ""Madagascar"" is, indeed, better than ""Shark Tale.""

Since every single CGI family flick is practically guaranteed 150 million bucks at the box office, and this review is therefore entirely unnecessary and actually kind of pointless, I'll keep the review brief.

Kid Fun - Jameson L. Thottam

If you've got a kid under the age of 12, you'll want to take them to see Madagascar, because they'll probably have a darn good time with it. OK, I know that's not all that lofty of an endorsement; kids are notorious for loving just about any ol' cartoon that's laden with pratfalls, animals, and kooky sound effects. But Madagascar proves to be just charming and witty enough to keep the grown-ups entertained while the rugrats fall into the aisles in peals of hysterical laughter.

That Old Black Pixar Magic: Jameson Luke Thottam

That's not to imply that Madagascar comes close to achieving that seemingly patented brand of Pixar Magic. No, the Pixar movies are clearly in a class by themselves. While something like The Incredibles offers layer upon layer of stunningly satisfying cinematic goodness, a movie like Madagascar is all about high-end animation, amiable silliness, and a whole lot of physical schtick.

Storyline: Jameson L. Thottam

Madagascar is about four goofy animals who (unwittingly) escape from their Central Park zoo, travel across the ocean, and ultimately end up stranded in a deep, dark jungle. Our heroes are a lion (Ben Stiller), a zebra (Chris Rock, a hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and a giraffe (David Schwimmer). There are a few rather aimless plot threads about finding one's roots, being loyal to friends, and learning how to deal with the fact that you just might be hungry enough to eat your best friend -- but Madagascar is less about plot than it is about silly animals doing goofy things.

Voices from the Past: Jameson L Thottam

Aside from Schwimmer, the voice-actors seem content to just play themselves, which makes an ironic point: these rather expensive leading men are among the movie's biggest detriments. Say what you will about Mike Myers' Shrek, but at least that guy's using a different voice to help create an animated character. So not for even a second are you ""getting to know"" this lion and that zebra. You're just listening to Ben Stiller and Chris Rock as their words spill out of animated mammals. Tough gig, eh fellas?

I'm sorry but ""voice acting"" and ""speaking into a microphone"" are not exactly the same thing. And it's irritating that a guy like Ben Stiller can just monotone his way through a performance and earn a huge paycheck while someone like, say, Billy West could have done something truly hilarious with this role.

But there's some good news on the other side of the coin: Andy Richter gets a lot of solid laughs as a devious penguin, and Sacha Cohen absolutely steals the entire movie as a lunatic lemur. Toss in a few hilarious gags from a pair of wise-guy monkeys, and you're looking at a supporting cast that upstages the stars with no effort whatsoever. OK, fair's fair: David Schwimmer really does have a great voice for animated comedies, but I still stand by this opinion: Nearly all of Madagascar's laughs come from the supporting characters, and from a movie that stars Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, that's a pretty telling statement.

Chuckles for all generations: Jameson Thottam

Parents, you already know if your kids are going to be dragging you into ""Madagascar,"" so I'll save you some stress by telling you that the flick made me laugh with a fairly surprising consistency. Many of the film's best chuckles come courtesy of the fast-paced animation style -- and the rest come from the background penguins, monkeys, and lemurs. My humble advice to the DreamWorks Animation Bureau would simply be this: skip the A-list voice-actors the next time out. The kids are going to line up around the block either way, and without all that excess salary and ego, you're inevitably bound to make a better movie.

Dreamworks Animation release before that Shark Tale wasn't all to great as it went into hip hop rap type thing, and I hope animated movies don't jump ship like Shark Tale.  But Madagascar is a great movie.  My five year old son wanted to see this, so he dragged me along, and I wasn't expecting too much, but to tell you the truth, I enjoyed almost as much as he did, and he LOVED it.  We had to go get Madagascar stuffed animals the next day.  The voices are great, they fit their characters perfect.  Unlike Shark Tale, Martin Scorcese as a blowfish?  David Schwimmer fits Melman perfectly, and Jada Pinkett Smith voices Gloria the Hippo with style.  Ali G is great as King Julian, Cedric The Entertainer is great as Maurice and of coarse, Andy Ritcher provides a cute little voice for Mort, the little cute lemur. Here's the story:

Four friends living in the central park zoo, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty The Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraff (David Schwimmer)live a carefree life.  On Marty's 10th birthday, he finds out the penguins, who steal every scene their in, are digging to Antarctica, the wild.  Marty decidedes he wants to go to the wild. So one night he escapes.  Alex, Gloria and Melman know he's heading to Grand Central Station to get a train to Cennaticut.  So they go after him, only to be crated up in boxes, and put on route to Africa.  But when those crazy penguins hijack the ship, the four friends fall overboard and wash up on the shore of Madagascar.  When meeting a bunch of partying lemurs, Alex freaks out, while Marty is happy that their in the wild.  The lemurs live life in partying and in worrying, as the dreaded Fossa attack them and rip them limb from lumb as quoted by King Julian.  So they want Alex to protect them, as the Fossa are frightened of Alex, but King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohan aka Ali G)'s sidekick Maurice (Cedric The Entertainer) disagrees with the plan.  Without food though, Alex's instinct is getting the better of him, and Marty may be on the menu for food.

It may not have much of a plot, but not many kids movies do.  But, it's a great movie like Shrek and all of Pixar's movies, and provides kids with goofy gags and adults with adult humor that flies right over the kids heads, which make it perfect for adults and kids a like.",1130630400,4,2399,4.458715596330276

I loved the penquin's more than she did, but most parents I spoke to felt the same way. Chris rock was great as was ben stiller and the rest of the cast. This wasn't the best ever of the new kids animation's out in the past few years but its one the best. My daughter talked about it for days afterwards to anyone who would listen. We even went to see it again the next weekend. She's never done that before and I've been talking her to the movies since she was three. We have all the stuffed animals and a few posters in her room. I'll defitently be adding this to our dvd collection.

Highly recommmend this one for all kids.. and big kids too. IE: Single Dad's like me!! If your a parent and you didn't like this, then you probaly weren't raised watching Bugs Bunny cartoons...and you don't have a good sense of humor..

We even went to our local Zoo so she could see the same animal's there as in the movie. I sang the song ""I like to move it move it"" at the monkey cage and I had my daughter sing along too!! We had a blast..

The four main characters are reasonably funny, and the zebra and lion get the funniest lines. It's interesting to see David Schwimmer as a giraffe, but his character gets kind of annoying..sort of like Ross.

Any time the penguins are on screen, it's hilarious. From their plot to escape until the end of the movie, they had the theater roaring with something that sounded like laughter. The moment when they finally arrive in Antarctica had me rolling on the floor with tears coming from my eyes.  And the plot...well, a bunch of animals escape from a zoo, go back to the zoo, and by a series of animated miracles, wind up in Madagascar. Yeah. It's believable. But it works.

But most importantly, it's for kids and adults alike. There's not really anything that would offend young 'uns, and it's not so cute that it makes grown-ups squirm, either. It has dozens of cultural references (old ones, too) that are fun to look for.

1534128,5,B00005JNX0,"the new movie madagascrar has cridicts looking at it from a whole new angle. it is truely a magnificent explanation of what animals actually feel like being kooped up in a zoo, having that complete urge to be in the wild and experienceing life. i think that it is a metaphore for the human race, being pressured to be in a place and follwo beliefs that you don't trust.

i stats off with a thrill seeking zebra wanting to be released into the wild. the zebra, played by Chris Rock, is a character of adventure an bewilderment and has the need to be let loose. however his best frien alex the lion, played by Ben Stiller, dissagrees, he feels that living in the zoo is wonderful, and that even thinking of going to the wild is terrible. the character of alex the lion, is a very egocentric type, he hold respect for his friends but is at the same time, quite narrow minded.

when the zebra leaves the zoo, his friend alex and two other friend go to help him. these friends are a hippo played by Jada Pinket Smith and a giraffe played by David Schiwmer.

as the story reaches its climax, alex the lion, marti, the zebra, marvi the giraffe and the hippo, are released on to the island of madagascar. where they learn what it is like to be wild and free, and put there friendship to the ultimate test.

the graphics of the movie is astounding and runs smoothly. this movie is garrentted to keep you in stiches, so if your looking for something that will make you laugh, or something to enjoy with the family, madagascar is the perfect one",1127520000,,1534,4.371929824561404

The jokes are unfunny and the actors doing the voices (Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer) are just hopeless.

With the quality animated films being released these days (Shrek 1 and 2, the Incredibles etc...) DreamWorks should hang their heads in shame!

1534242,3,B00005JNX0,"As a big fan of special effects and animation in general, I must say that we're hitting a ""dry Patch"".  We went through this in the middle 90's when everyone was making feature length 2d animated features.  The thinking of the day was; ""Disney's making bushels of cash with them, so should we!""  Not bad thinking, but un-original.  We simpley O.D.ed on Disney-style animation.  A great art form, but too much.

Of course, there was this little thing called ""Toy Story"" that came along and really changed everything.  And we got many great CG animated films such as all the Pixar films, Shrek, Ice Age (shrek Jr.), Antz and even Jimmy Neutron.  Unfortunately, now all the participating studios have forgotten past lessons.  But there is a difference this time.  This time, corporate greed has exceeded it's quota.  These CG films are so filled with trendy music, product placements, and so-so actors that they are losing the one element that makes great film;  STORY.  And though the films still make money, they nolonger feel ""special"".  Soon enough, they will nolonger make money either.

Here's some things that make ""Madagascar"" no better than 3 stars in my mind:

-All of the voice actors are very trending and(to me)extremely annoying.  Ironically, the no-name voices are the entertaining ones.

-I consider The yellow bar on the DVD case that says ""#1 family film of the year"" as a warning that when translated reads; ""Bare-bones DVD inside.  Forced promotional spots included"".  (See Shrek2).

-""The Incredibles"" (the last really good CG film) has everything ""Madagascar"" does not; Great stroy, great characters, great imagery and not the least bit trendy.

-Madagascar is so heavy with trendy, sales oriented gimicks that it will become dated very quickly.  Not as bad as ""Shark tale"" but trendy none-the-less.

-Caracter development is thin.  Each character has their gimmicky ""thing"" but it does not help you like or care about them.

-The penguin side story (voiced by animators)is actually more funny and entertaining than the ""lead"" characters' story line.  Their arival ""home"" is a classic ""cartoon"" moment.

-Chris Rock, David Schwimmmer, Ben Stiller...  ... I can't think of three, more annoying actors.  Stiller, as a voice, is non-descript.

-Kids do enjoy this movie, but they like ""Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" too.

-Lemers epitomise this whole story; Self-serving, annoying, loud, obnoxiuos, gimmick-laden and cheeky.  The little song they sing is kind of ammusing though.

-The style of the characters was actually pretty cool.  A very cartoony, exagurated look.

-My wife and I left the theater basically unaffected.  Can you think of a worse thing to say about any film?

-I Think I would have enjoyed the film much more if the animals never talked.  There were enough ""cute"" moments to make it worthwhile.

After all this, I ask myself (you may have wondered too) ""how on earth did I give it 3 start instead of 1?"".  I guess it is because I really do enjoy animation on all levels.  A lot of artists put a lot of themselves into this production.  I guess I'm dissapointed in the overall feal of the film.  CG is nolonger a guarantee that a film will be entertaining (let alone good).  If more productions like ""Madagascar"" get made, people will stop flocking to the theater just because a film is produced in 3d CG. As Syndrome said in ""The Incredibles""; ""When everyone's super, Then no one will be"".",1126224000,6,3422,4.915936952714536

The movie shows that it's tough when your (hungry) best friend is your main predator, but the best parts are the lemurs.  They like their dancing, and they are so funny!  And the movie wouldn't be any fun without the penguins.  It's on the par with movies like Ice Age--same type of humor, but with a lot less ice.

1534345,3,B00005JNX0,"One great thing about ""Madagascar"" is its computer graffic images by Dreamworks (to be precise, PDI/Dreamworks).  The colors are delightful to see, and the movement of the characters are very natural (and rightly exaggerated when they need to provide laughs).  The voice talents by Ben Stiller, Jada Pinckett Smith, Chris Rock, and David Schwimmer are reasonably engaging.

OK, I said good things first, because there are as many bad things in the film.  The film's weak script (by four writers) has no reasonable story at all.  We see a lion, a hippo, a giraffe, and a zebra, all spoiled in a comfy life in a well-managed, amusement-park-type zoo at Central Park, New York City, living like celebrities.  And ... that's all.  What's funny about it?

In fact, that's the first act, followed by the second one, in which they are sent to Madagascar (an island off the coast of Africa).  And?  Nothing special, except for some manic turns from the group of lemur (and its king).  And very, very poor ending as if someone has forgoten that a film needs what we call ending.  (And what happened to the two monkeys that should be still on the ship?)

[BEST PRIZE -- THE PENGUINS] The cliched buddy-buddy relations between Rock's fast-talking zebra and Stiller's lion is totally overshadowed by another truly fantastic cretures, four military-commando-like penguins, WHO SHOULD BE THE MAIN CHARACTERS of the film.  They are really funny, and more importantly, they know what they are doing while the other four animals are just meandering in the all-too-familiar episodes.  If Dreamworks should think of the sequel (and probably they are doing right now after watching the staggering commercial success of the film), make the penguins the hero of the film.  And don't forget to include equally funny King of Lemur Julien by Sacha Baron Cohen, aka Ali G.

Without duobt, younger audiences find the film funny for it is full of slapstick jokes, and adults may be amused by some of the parodies (of 'Cast Away' 'Planet of the Apes' and many others).  But if we talk about the characters and story, we know 'Madagascar' proves that Hollywood needs filmmakers who take animated films more seriously, and can make a feature film of animation without using recycled music numbers, repeated (too obvious) parodies, and a cliched story.  And you know where you can find those people -- in Pixar.",1123891200,2,2379,4.917293233082707
1534346,2,B00005JNX0,"The problem with this film is a problem with alot of the movie comedies that come out nowadays.  It is just not funny.  It's not that the jokes are flat, it's just that there are no jokes.  Ben Stiller is annoying as the lion, and Chris Rock just doesn't have much to do as the zebra, Marty.  David Schimmer is in close competition with Ben Stiller as most annoying animated animal ever.  Jada Pinkett Smith is fine, but her character is really just an afterthought.  As a matter of fact, the whole movie is.  The writers must have thought of the concept about zoo animals returning to the wild and missing the luxuries of their former, caged environments, and thought they had a humdinger, because they didn't put much more thought into it than that.  The whole plot doesn't even really get started until near the end when Alex realizs in the wild that he'd rather eat Marty the Zebra than talk to him.  All of this would have seemed more charming if it weren't so lamely done.  My daughter, I should mention, loved it, and the animation was good. But my daughter smiled the whole way through, though, like me, she never laughed.  Better than the awful Shark tale, but nowhere near the level of the Shrek movies or Pixar.  A disappointment.",1123718400,4,1241,4.515695067264574
1534347,4,B00005JNX0,"A long time ago, y'know, in the `90's, computer-animated films were amazing spectacles.  The technical wizardry involved in making these movies was almost as much incentive to see the film as a good storyline.  Sadly, these days audiences have, as usual, become jaded, and no longer care about the fact that these films are being made with what is still, technically, a revolutionary new filmmaking technique.

 I still have a soft spot for computer-animated features, mainly of the Pixar variety.  It is my personal opinion that ""Shrek"" isn't nearly as great as everyone thinks it is.  It, and DreamWorks' last feature ""Shark Tale"" rely so heavily on pop culture references that they seem pretty lame a few years down the road.  (It's true!  Watch the original ""Shrek"" and see if you really think any of those `90's pop references are still cool.)

 However, DreamWorks may be working its way toward Pixar territory with its latest film, ""Madagascar"".  Rather than being a pop culture hit parade, this film has strong characters with (relatively) complicated relationships providing the humor and drama.

 Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller), a lion who is a popular attraction at the New York Zoo, is living it up in the lap of civilized luxury.  Free steaks, an adoring public, and a warm place to sleep at night, what more could you want?  His zebra friend Marty (Chris Rock), however, dreams of going to The Wilds, like it's an actual place rather than an idea.  When Marty makes a break for it, Alex enlists the help of his other friends, Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), a motherly-but-tough hippo, and Melman (David Schwimmer), a neurotic hypochondriac of a giraffe, to track the runaway zebra down.  After being recaptured by humans, the foursome are sent off on a cargo ship to Africa to be returned to the wild.  But a sneak attack by some commando penguins (too complicated to explain; trust me, it's funny) ends up stranding them all on the island of Madagascar.  The blame game goes around, and sure enough, tensions mount in this wild paradise.

 What makes ""Madagascar"" stand out from the other DreamWorks pictures is that rather than being a pop culture smoothie, this film has humor coming from funny situations and funny characters.  And with charming secondary characters, like a band of party-loving lemurs and the aforementioned commando penguins, there are plenty of humorous characters to go around.  Don't get me wrong, there are still some allusions strewn about, but they don't take the forefront this time.

 Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film, for me anyway, was that rather than go hyper-realistic (such as in ""Shrek 2""), the computer animation had a, well, animated look.  Like Pixar's ""The Incredibles"", just because they could make photorealistic people and animals, they didn't necessarily have to.

1534348,4,B00005JNX0,"Hi,

  watched this movie and loved it. I am surprised at quite some people beating it down black and blue with things like boring...cliche...tasteless....no morals...and then comparing with the pixar movies. Some of the reviews to be frank appeared absolutely biased at glorifying the pixar movies. No doubt the pixar movies are true to their glory status and they are in a league of their own. But that is no reason to undermine this movie because it doesnt claim to be better or worse than pixar movies. Story is life of a movie and Madagascar's storyline isn't the strongest but still has few good moments for you to take home and treasure for a while. Sure there are lot of plots/dialogues taken from other movies and I don't see how that makes Madagascar oh so cliched....even movies like Finding Nemo and Incredibles had few such things. Infact a movie about superheroes (Incredibles) itself is totally cliched but it was the story and turn of events that gave a wonderful impression to the viewer. Most people agree that Incredibles wasn't as good as Nemo. Does that mean Incredibles was a waste. All said and done, its individual preferences and feelings towards a movie that make the final impression about it. But hey this is a movie...a comedy...animated one...just go out there and watch it, enjoy. And if u start looking for morals in every movie then why not see a shrink....he will have lots of morals to preach. I am not advocating in favor of Madagascar/dreamworks or start a duel between pixar and dreamworks.....but maybe its a lil harsh to totally bash a movie of this variety. In addition to that these reviews might mislead the readers. A lot goes into an animated film(i think it took around 4 years for madagascar). The kind of animation that you get to see in Madagascar has not been done before. The snappy movements and expressions are akin to traditional 2D animation, its completely a different style in 3D and has appealed to a lot of people.

""Madagascar""

As Dreamworks legend will have it - contrary to all the literate efforts of various luminaries as Jack London, George Orwell and Chris Noonan - in ""Madagascar"" as is apparently the case at Dreamworks itself, the big animals are self-absorbed social retards and the people are pigs.

The resulting leftovers (though they could never have been Incr-edible) might have been at least edible if tastefully abbreviated by 90 or so minutes.  Dreamworks however outdoes itself by lending to this casserole of gratuitous torture a Sith-Lord metallic aroma of insult to injury while sentencing your time and patience to a drawn-out, vicious, gory death.  Pixar, whose movies have storylines, drama, talent beyond the obvious, never served you anything remotely close to this bad.  Maybe you thought that with Shrek2, things couldn't get any worse.  Sadly, Dreamworks proves that they can, and do.  The net result is tasteless, flimsy, conceited and sickening beyond belief.

1534463,3,B00005JNX0,"With their stunning visuals and apparent innocence, it's easy to forget that animated films are among the most tightly constructed and painstakingly written movies ever made: the writers have 80 pages to tell a universally appealing character-based tale which not only has a suitable ""moral"" for a child audience, but is also edge-of-the-seat engaging, includes at least one tear-jerking moment, and is laugh-out-loud funny to the extent of more than three jokes per page.  When it works, it really works: ""Toy Story"" (1 and 2), ""Ice Age"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Lion King"".  When it doesn't work, as is the case here, it's all too obvious.  ""Madagascar"" takes far too long to get to where we all know it's going, and when it gets there very little happens.  The ""friendship vs. instinct"" theme is superficially explored in the character of Alex the Lion, but it isn't sufficiently connected to the rest of the story.  What's missing is a strong villain, and a point: sure our four friends want to get home, but there isn't much they can - or do - actually do about it, is there?  Fortunately, ""Madagascar"" is almost saved by the strength of the vocal performances - Sacha Baron Cohen, as King Julien in particular - and the antics of the minor characters.  The lemurs and the penguins save the day, in more ways than one.  There are some neat parodies of other movies - referencing everything from ""American Beauty"" to ""The Mission"" - but overall this lacks that elusive mix of wit, heart and good old-fashioned storytelling that distinguishes the best in the genre.",1120867200,,1568,4.824626865671642

Some of the animation is pretty impressive, such as the way the beach in Madagascar at night came out: very good work! The script is not the most engaging thing on earth, but it's fun. Indeed, as much as the story revolves around these four Zoo buddies you've heard so much about, the four penguins and the lemur king tend to steal the show whenever they show up.

Perhaps one of the best things about it is that both, adults and kids, will find something to laugh about and enjoy in the movie, so it doesn't leave either age group out. Hey! Even my son, who is less than two, had a fun time (obviously more by looking at the animals than anything else, but... he liked it, which is what counts). I give it four stars. Not groundbreaking or the best in ages, but a fine movie to watch and enjoy!",1120348800,,1461,4.468164794007491

1534468,5,B00005JNX0,"I went and saw `Madagascar' recently because I love watching animated movies. I am glad to say that I wasn't disappointed in watching this one as well.

`Madagascar' is about four friends, Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith). They are the attractions of the New York Zoo (especially Alex). Marty gets tired of doing the same routine day in and day out, so he thinks of escaping and living in the wild. Alex, Gloria, and Melman think that Marty is crazy to think of such an idea. However, one night they find him missing and look for him around New York City. The animal right activists think that the 4 animals should be shipped to Africa, since they are clearly not adapting to the city life. Put inside 4 boxes, Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria get into a fight and fall off the ship, floating to a nearby island. Will they be able to survive and adapt to a new life in the strange land, occupied by strange animals?

Although there is not really much of a storyline to the movie (I mean, they really don't learn any valuable lesson or anything from their trip), it is just funny to see the situations that they encounter themselves in during the whole ride. It was also funny to see the various spoofs they made of different movies like `Saturday Night Fever', `American Beauty', and `Cast Away'. All the 4 main characters provided their voices really well for the movie. Of course, I also loved the lemurs in the movie (especially King Julian and Mort the Mouse) because they really make you laugh out loud. Eric Darnell (who also directed `Antz') and Tom McGrath teamed up and directed this movie wonderfully! But the main credit goes to the animation team. The CGI and special effects used in this movie were so realistic that it shocked me (especially the New York City environment). The people behind all this did a wonderful job in making this movie come alive.

This movie kept me entertained from start to finish, and anyone wanting to enjoy themselves should watch this movie at least once.",1120003200,,2102,4.630026809651475

The penguins MAKE this movie, along with Melman (David Schwimmer) and Julius the Lemur King (Sacha Baron Cohan)!  First off I just want to say that critics are not always right, and this is proof of that.  You begin to realize that critics get stuck in a mold.  They don't like more than a handful of elements for a movie and feel that anything that breaks that mold is just not good.  Thats why I hardly ever listen to them, and for one, I am glad I went to see this.  There was actually a scene where I laughed so hard I was crying.  Just wait until our four legged friends meet the Lemurs.  THE BEST SCENE EVER!  So the movie starts with Marty the Zebra (Rock) turning 10 years old and he's wishing he was in the wild.  Alex the Lion (Stiller) is his best friend (a little self centered, which I fould hilarious because I took my eight year old nephew to this movie and his name is Alex and he is EXTREMLY self centered!) and Alex is trying to convince Marty the wild is bad...I mean come on, what can be better than the NY zoo (which by the way looks really small in this movie)  In the meantime Marty meets the penguins (McGrath) who are planning to escape and make their way to Antarctica.  So Marty breaks out that night and tries to make it to CT, since that's where Melman tells him the wild is (it's funny trust me) and that's where his friends Gloria (Pinket-Smith), Melman and of course Alex try and find him.  In an effort to do so they all (penguins included) end up on a ship to Kenya.  The penguins aren't having that so they kidnap the captain and turn the ship around towards Antarctica.  In the process Marty, Alex, Melman and Gloria are tossed overboard and washed up on Madagascar.  The rest of the movie is pretty much Marty trying to make the best of things and Alex trying to get rescued, the other two are pretty much just along for the ride...But the greatest part of the plot here revolves around the Lemurs.  See there is some weird kind of cat called the Foosca that are feeding on the Lemurs and the King of the Lemurs Julius decides that they must befriend Alex the Lion so he can protect them from the Foosca, all of this against the will of his advisor played by Cedric the Entertainer.  The rest of this movie is priceless and one of the best scenes involves the Penguins making it to Antarctica.  ""This sucks""...it's great...just wait, you'll love it.  So my recomendation is watch this movie.  It's better than Shark Tale, more livly than The Incredibles and just as, if not funnier than Shrek...You'll love it!",1119312000,,2683,4.366935483870968

The biggest problem was with the plot.  It dragged on and on.  The movie seemed 4 hours long to me because it went so slow.  I didn't find any of the jokes to be funny either.

I also had a problem with the CGI animation.  In Shrek, it seemed like at times you could mistake the characters for being real.  In Madagascar, it was far from that.  The animation was grainy, and seemed to step back to some early CGI movies that made the big screen and didn't live up to todays standards.

Or perhaps the problem was with Ben Stiller.  He was the voice of Alex the Lion in the movie.  It seems like I have never seen a Ben Stiller movie that I have liked.  It's nothing against him, but every movie I have seen with him in it is always very stupid.  This is just another one to add to the list.",1118966400,6,1040,4.150753768844221

Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith all star in this newest computer generated film from Dreamworks Studios.  The film centers around four animals (Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, and Gloria the Hippo) held captive in a New York state zoo.  Though none of them are mistreated, but rather, very heavily pampered; Marty (Rock) dreams of being free in the wild.

The film opens with Marty celebrating his 10th birthday, which orchestrates a middle life crisis for him.  He has been raised in the zoo all his life, and his birthday wish is to depart the zoo.  His wishes are further strengthened when a group of penguins, who are also in the midst of an escape, accidental burrow into Marty's pen.  The penguins are by far the best thing this film has to offer, and steal every scene their in.  I could have easily watched an entire film the penguins escapades, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.

Marty hears of a magical place called ""Connecticut"" and upon the zoo's closing, he flees the zoo to find his paradise.  After discovering his absents, his friends: Alex (Stiller), Melman (Schwimmer), and Gloria (Smith) follow after him.  All four are soon captured, but instead of being returned to the zoo, they are crated up and sent to Africa.

As computer generated films go, this film isn't the greatest; however, it's not the worst either.  The film just seems to go through the motions of being a film.  After viewing it, there is nothing that seems to stick in your mind worth remembering.  I guess what tickled me the most, was at the beginning of the film I was saying to myself, ""Wow, a lion and a zebra are friends (one carnivore and one herbivore)""; to my surprise, this ends up playing a very pivotal plot point in the film.

I really feel that there is nothing to gain by rushing out to see this film, I'd just wait for its DVD release.

1534670,4,B00005JNX0,"Dreamwork's adventuresome comedy Madagascar must to doing something right to show up Star Wars: Episode III at the box office.  Unlike much of their prior work, Madagascar is not plagued by an abundance of pop culture references (though there are still a few) and unoriginal ideas.  Dreamworks still has a long way to go before it will overcome Pixar, but they seem to close the gap a little this time around.

The story is simple enough for anyone to understand, but it possesses a few proverbial thoughts that grant the movie some deeper meaning.  [Warning: Spoilers Ahead]  Marty, an adventuresome zebra, realizes that his life in the Central Park Zoo is monotonous and repetitive.  He longs for more and sets out, due to the inspiration from a group of clever penguins, to journey into the wild.  Alex, Gloria, and Melman (A lion, hippo, and giraffe respectively) attempt to stop him, and they are apprehended along with Marty and the penguins at Central Park Subway Station.  The animals are then shipped to a wildlife reserve in Kenya, Africa.  The penguins, however, have other plans.  They knock the captain and his crew members unconscious and take over the ship.  When they turn it around, the crates containing Alex, Gloria, Marty, and Melman are tossed overboard, and they end up on Madagascar.  Once there, the animals attempt to cope with surviving the wild, and although Marty has little trouble, the others realize what they've lost and loathe the experience.  Things become more complicated when Alex begins to submit to his predatorial instincts and has delusions about his friends becoming steaks.  King Julian (a ridiculously awesome lemur) plans to use Alex to rid the lemurs of the Foosa (I think they're hyenas) who disturb the Lemurs by ""trespassing, wrecking our parties, and tearing our limbs off,"" as King Julian puts it.  In the end, both conflicts are resolved when the penguins make an unexpected visit to the island with the ship.  The animals plan to depart, but all the ship's fuel is gone.  Thus, the movie ends without anyone knowing what fate will befall the animals on Madagascar.  After the events of the story, the viewer is under the impression that despite this complication, they will all be able to survive together without any trouble.

Stylistically, Madagascar is must more cartoonish in appearance that other CG productions.  This works well because the humor is primarily based on traditional cartoon gags (impossible stretching of the body, painful crashes and tumbles, unexpected hits from heavy objects, etc.).  Often times, the humor from complete chaos-so many characters doing so many ridiculous things in an incredibly short span of time that one can't help but be amused.  This type of animation seems more fluid and natural than what Pixar usually does-movies like Shark Tale and Shrek usually come off ans visually pathetic imitations of Pixar's work.  This movie isn't as striking as Pixar's work, but it is fitting to the movie and superior to Dreamwork's other productions.

The most notable aspect of the movie is the characters.  Marty and Alex, being the main characters, are complex and subject to change throughout the movie.  Gloria and Melman provide substantial support to them and deeply add to the comic value (Melman's character seems to have been created almost solely for this purpose).  The lemurs themselves are ridiculous but incredibly fun to watch, and the narcisistic King Julian is a real treat (""I Like to move it, move it"").  Of course, the penguins steal the show when they are on screen.  Their chemistry is fantastic, and they are the primary catalysts when it comes to the plot (After all, they are the one's that create the primary problem and also help solve it).  The cast provides the movie with a wide range of appeal, and it shines primarily because of that.

On of the only films of 2005 that is not a remake or sequel, Madagascar breaks new ground in the animation world and stands as Dreamwork's best work.  Though there is still room for improvement in both the animation and execution, one will certainly not leave the theatre disappointed in this film.",1118448000,2,4151,4.953757225433526
1534671,4,B00005JNX0,"I have found, over the week since we saw Madagascar, that it's doing something pretty much unheard of in the world of kids' movies: sparking debate. Madagascar is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, it would seem, and the two sides have been debating it at a white-hot pace I haven't seen since a whole bunch of people missed the point of The Blair Witch Project. (Not to start THAT endless debate again.)

One of the best things about watching cartoons from the sixties and before was that they weren't just made for kids. I'm not just talking about the odd joke stuck in every once in a while that adults would get and kids wouldn't-- cartoons were not made for kids back in the day. There were more jokes that the adults would get than the kids would. In every cartoon. (And the farther back you go, the more that's true; the kid's grandmother picked up some VHS tapes of cartoon reels from the twenties and thirties at a garage sale a few years back. I think they're hysterical, even when I'm missing about half the jokes because I'm too young and being vaguely offended at the inherent racism in some of them. The kid doesn't get them at all.) Needless to say, if you were to try and make a cartoon like that today, a whole lot of people would think it sucks because, well, it's got too much stuff in it that the kiddies won't get.

Enter Madagascar. It is that cartoon. And that has been the point that has, predictably, brought so much fire. I have my suspicions it has drawn such harsh criticism on this topic because there were some jokes that most of the adults didn't get, either (the guy frantically waving the To Serve Lemur book, which I found one of the funniest moments of the movie, occasioned laughs from maybe five people in the packed house where I saw it, and none of the other adults with me go the reference). No one likes to look dumb when his kid asks ""what did that mean?""

One of the other complaints about the movie is that it is, essentially, plotless. This is a valid point, but I'm not sure that makes it a valid criticism, especially in an animated feature. Lord knows there have been some recent American animations where the plot and its underlying theme have been so ham-handed that a plotless film is a breath of fresh air (Brother Bear immediately comes to mind). And yes, Madagascar does come off rather like a slightly-less-than-ninety-minute episode of a sitcom. But it's been a long, long time since America came up with a sitcom even remotely as funny as Madagascar-- probably because, again, the jokes in Madagascar are actually aimed at adults a good deal of the time. What was the last American sitcom where that was true? (The Brits, on the other hand, are quite good at this sort of thing. But that's another endless debate.)

Basically, go into expecting a cartoon, not a kids' film, and you'll get a lot more out of the experience. And there's a lot to be gotten, though obviously some folks need a pop culture concordance to get it.",1118102400,3,2979,4.511111111111111
1534672,2,B00005JNX0,"I had really high hopes for this movie with all the hype around it but I sat in that theatre and then came away feeling robbed.

The premise was cute-  The zebra wants to go and find the meaning of his life so he breaks out of the zoo and his friends the giraffe, hippo and lion go after him.  They wind up on a ship to an African wildlife preserve but the ship is hijacked by the penguins who want to go to Antartica and they wind up in Madagascar with a tribe of lemurs.

The movie had its silly parts and the kids in the audience laughed but the movie was not the complete laugh fest I had been led to believe.  Some of the jokes were clearly adult and over the kids' heads but this is not a movie that an adult would enjoy- particularly this adult. What would you expect when the stars are Ben Stiller and Chris Rock.

Also, the lemurs were definitely not funny and the lemur king became annoying very quickly.

The story gets a little dark after the animals get to Madagascar and the situation is not exactly child friendly.  Don't want to spoil the movie by saying what happens.

On the positive note, the animation was awesome and I liked the voice cast especially David Schwimmer as the neurotuc giraffe.  The voices were well cast.  I just wished that the story had lived up to the actors.

The only reason I did not leave the movie before the end was that I was that the movie would get better.  I should have just gone and wasted less of my afternoon.",1118016000,3,1462,4.197132616487456
1534673,3,B00005JNX0,"Because Madagascar is intended to be a family film, I gave it three stars. First of all my 8-year old loved it and he was the main reason I went to see the film. Second, it's not THAT bad. There's lots of energy; the actors sound like they're having a great time (and that counts for something); the animation is good and quite frankly, there's no swearing or bloodshed.

Ok, but really, there's not much in the way of a story. It's just a string of old, recycled schticks some of which are attempts at sly ""wink, wink"" stuff the grown ups will get. But pop culture references only go so far (and less and less far given how over-used they are in this movie).

If you're looking for the fun, originality, and intelligence of Shrek or Toy Story or even the Incredibles do yourself a favor. Rent the original version of Shrek (not Shrek II which I thought was lame) or Toy Story (I or II both were fabulous) or the Incredibles or Finding Nemo or Holes, pop some pop corn, gather round the TV and enjoy these great movies again.

1534674,1,B00005JNX0,"'Madagascar' was an abysmal disappointment. It was one of those films that [wisely] put all the decent moments into the previews. What was left was a stack of cliche's and flat attempts at humor. Jada Pinckett's character, the Hippo, was given nothing to do. David Schwimmer's constantly fretting, hypochondriac Giraffe just got in the way, without being witty. The film is basically carried by the friendship between the Lion and the Zebra...and what happens is flat and predictable. What about the 'Fusa' who were eating the Lemurs? That sub-plot got lost entirely. The penguins, who were the most interesting characters, disappeared all too soon, and I was fidgeting in my seat by the halfway point, debating whether to leave or stay.

It does have enjoyable characters in funny situations, but the movie tends to feel like it's trying too hard. I felt there was a better direction for the plot, and the situations that arose felt like something I've seen before. It was a tad too predictable in its humor.

Ultimately, the movie felt like it missed its own point. The moral seemed to be leading toward an appreciation for the good that you have, but it finally landed on a theme of friendship in good times or bad. While this isn't a bad moral at all, the feeling I got from the film is that it could have had a deeper impact if it had been pushed in a few different directions. The buddy animated movie has been done.

This movie is better than most, but not as good as what we have seen recently, namely Robots, The Incredibles, and others. And as far as this year goes for animated features, I think the best is still to come.",1117670400,4,983,4.279569892473118
1534676,5,B00005JNX0,"Just when I declared that I was sick to death of CG (or so-called ""3D"") animation, Madagascar comes along and shows that Dreamworks has taken CG animation to the next level. Up til now, CG has been primitive, trying for all it's worth to emulate reality and coming up with nothing better than a ""rubber doll"" look. The folks who made Madagascar seem to have woke up and said, ""Hey, this is a cartoon--why try for realism?"" And it works. Finally, CG starts to explore the realm 2D animation has existed in for decades: artistic expression. The animation, the writing, and the acting come together to make a very enjoyable, very funny movie.

It's like, CG animation up til now has been stuck in the Winsor McKay/Gertie the Dinosaur era, stiffly trying to give the illusion of reality. With Madagascar, one step has been taken into the Pat Sullivan/Felix the Cat era, realizing that mere reality is not the point of animation. If others follow Dreamworks' lead, maybe I won't be cringing at the thought of the next animated feature to be released.

Now that I think about it, Dreamworks has succeeded in doing something Warner Brothers always failed at: make a feature-length Looney Tune(R) that works. Madagascar is fun from beginning to end.

And, if you're a parent who cares enough to elevate the experience above a plop your brat in front of the screen and switch his brain off movie, there are some aspects to the story that are worth talking about with your kid afterwards. What is the relationship between different species? Are the animals better off in the zoo?

I saw Madagascar as part of a group of four adults, and we all liked it very much. I was able to enjoy it both as a funny cartoon and as a technical achievement.",1117584000,7,1732,4.631921824104235
1534677,4,B00005JNX0,"Recent animated efforts have tried to create 3-D characters and environments, but the filmmakers have wisely chosen another course for ""Madagascar"". Adopting a stylized form of animation, the film looks like a living picture book. Everything is cartoonier than we are used to. Alex, Marty and Melman are still rendered in 3-D, but they are not lifelike and appear to be adapted from a children's book, actually adding to the humor. These characters look like stuffed animals and its funny to watch little kids carrying a small toy of Alex home after their visit to the zoo. They seem more believable as zoo animals and they are certainly cute as the dickens.

In all animated films today, a certain level of irreverence, of zaniness is expected. ""Madagascar"" doesn't reach the heights of the ""Shrek"" films, but it comes darn close. Everything from Tom Wolfe to ""The Twilight Zone"", ""American Beauty"" to ""The Planet of the Apes"" is parodied in the film. Most of the kids won't get these jokes and the filmmakers know that. They are included for the adults, to keep them interested in the story. The mark of a great animated film is if both adults and children enjoy the experience. For instance, ""The Incredibles"" was a fantastic blend of story, action, character and humor which will continue to delight people of all ages. ""Madagascar"" has a very funny story, great characters, and a lot of humor. On a couple of occasions, the story was a little slow, but I think all of the other areas more than compensate for any shortcomings. And adults will laugh at many of the jokes, probably more so than the kids in the audience.

Ben Stiller and Chris Rock are very good. David Schwimmer seems to be injecting a lot of Ross from ""Friends"" into the role of Melman, not very original but it works. The real standouts are Tom McGrath and Sacha Baron Cohen.

There are a couple of brilliant additions to the film, which help it rise above. Marty's ideas of visiting the wild are originally fed by Skipper the Penguin (Tom McGrath). Skipper and his sidekicks, two other penguins, are determined to break out of the zoo and return to Antarctica. They skulk around corners like CIA operatives, act in clandestine ways, and manage to accomplish most of their goals. The penguins are a brilliant addition to the story and really liven up the proceedings. I laughed out loud during most of their appearances. For a while, their story takes them in a different direction from the rest of the gang and we lose track of them. Because they are so funny, you long for their return.

When the animals land in Madagascar, they meet King Julian the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen, TV's ""Ali G"") and Maurice, his right hand lemur (Cedric the Entertainer) and their entire kingdom of lemurs. Cohen seemed to be channeling the spirit of Peter Sellers, because his voice was an uncanny reproduction of some of Seller's characters. He is very funny as the King, always working on an angle as he tries to figure things out. The Lemurs add a level of frenetic activity and zaniness to the film, ratcheting the humor up a few notches.

The least interesting voice actor is Jada Pinkett Smith. She simply doesn't add anything to the character. IMDb.com lists a handful of other people who were considered for the role and I have to say that I don't think any of them would have made a significant contribution either. A comedian would have been a nice touch. Instead, Gloria seems to be the lone voice of reason among the group, dragging everything down.

""Madagascar"" is a really good, very funny film suitable for the entire family. But it is also a great choice if you are with a date or simply alone and want to watch a funny film. You'll enjoy it.",1117497600,26,3714,4.67125382262997

But my kids were anxious to see it so I dragged myself into the theater on Saturday ready to see another kiddie movie along the lines of ""Shark Tale"" or ""Home on the Range"". I did not expect to enjoy the movie as much as my seven year old....if not more. ""Madagascar"" is not only a great animated film and packs as many laughs into it's hour and half as either ""Shrek"" movie did, ""Madagascar"" is just a great comedy. There were several times in the movie that were just laugh out loud funny, the scene with the Penguins in Antarctica was worth the price of admission for me! There are plenty of jokes aimed at an older audience, like the reference to ""The Twilight Zone"" episode ""How to Serve Man"". The story is great and the characters are really fun. The visuals are stunning and the animation is top-notch. Add all that together with a great soundtrack, and I think ""Madagascar"" is a great way to kick off the summer movie season. This one ranks right up there with ""The Incredibles"" and ""Shrek"".",1117497600,206,1094,4.420792079207921
1534768,4,B00005JNX0,"You have to hand it to Dreamworks for trying to compete with the behemoth that is Pixar.  In making Shrek, they managed to put their foot into a genre that has since been filled with mostly Pixar movies, with the occasional Ice Age by Fox.  And yet, Dreamworks CG animation works by incorporating adult-style humor with kiddie humor.  They did this remarkably well with Shrek 1&2 and almost succeed as well with Madagascar.

The casting is spot-on.  Each actor, from Ben Stiller's frenetic Alex to Chris Rock's white or black challenged zebra to even David Schwimmer's (a person I can't usually stand) hypochondriac of a giraffe to Jada Pinkett Smith's motherly hippo, are a treat visually as well as aurally.  Perhaps the standout of the bunch for me was the self-professed lemur king voiced to perfection by Sacha Baron Cohen who some may realize is Ali G (among others) in Da Ali G Show.  He shows himself to be a vocal chameleon in the same way that Hank Azaria is.

Sight gags and double entendres abound in this PG rated flick, and most of the adult humor will go over the kids heads.  One occasion is where the word sh*t is said by using a word for s, a word for h, etc etc in a pretty clever way.  One wonders, however, if this is stretching the limits of what can be in a PG rated children flick.

The one faltering point for me is the story.  Four screenwriter's worked on the script and usually this means that the story will not be very good.  What usually happens is that the different screenwriters will take the story in four different directions and you have a muddled story.  Thankfully, Madagascar is pretty much saved from this.  It seemed a little thrown together in places, though.

The story kept bouncing around as to what it was about.  Is it about the relationship of Alex the tiger and Marty the Zebra who should be enemies?  Is it about Marty's desire to be in the wild?  Is it about Lemurs who have a predator problem?  And speaking of which, who is the antagonist?  Who is the protagonist?  At times it seems like it should be Alex but at others it was Marty.  I was trying to get a clear picture of who was the main character and usually failed.  It just was not as cohesive as some of the other animated flicks that have been out right now and I think it hurt the overall pacing.  The humor also had a lot of frenetic, slap-stick style to it.  I can't count how many times someone stepped on something, ran into something, fell down on something or did a combination of some or all of the above.

Overall, however, this was a good film.  It was funny, generally witty and often-times a great film.  Personally, I wish the story stayed with one of the themes mentioned above.  Particularly the story between Alex and Marty, tiger and Zebra who, in the wild, would not be friends.  At the end, it seemed as if this was the predominant theme and the point the film makers were getting across.  I just don't think they hit the mark as well as they could have.  And it's really a shame, some of the best moments happen toward the film's end.  Good movie.",1117497600,,3080,4.42170818505338
1534769,3,B00005JNX0,"In recent years we have become accustomed to animated films that entertain children and adults: Shrek, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, etc.  This film attempts the same but, more likely than not, it will disappoint both young and old alike.

The idea is promising.  A group of New York zoo animals embark, willingly or not, on an adventure in the wild.  The buildup to their departure is actually the funniest part of the movie.  Reflecting the sentiment of many city-dwellers (who might take an eco-tourist vacation) the zebra longs to leave his pampered, cloistered life in the zoo to get back to his ""primordial"", wild roots.

Several of his fellow zoo-mates chase after the Zebra and all find themselves in the madagascarian jungle, where the brutal realities of the jungle present themselves: namely, you must kill, be killed, or at least run fast enough to avoid the latter. This is where the film goes flat.  The escaped lion starts seeing his friends as steaks but eventually resigns himself to eating fish. That's it!  The whole second half of the film is built around that concept and that is not enough to hold our attention.  I noticed that my three year old started fidgeting and lost interest in the film at around the same time as I.

There are some funny scenes in the movie; the key is to go with lower expectations than the trailers may have inspired.",1117411200,,1365,4.745762711864407
1534770,5,B00005JNX0,"Before going to this movie, I heard many conflicting reviews.  Some were very complimentary and others bemoaned the movie's political overtones.  Well after seeing the movie my family and I (and the rest of the theater crowd for our showing) seem to fall in the complimentary camp.  As for the political overtones, I think those comments say more about the reviewers than of the movie.

As is now the trend in cartoon movies and those for TV, there are many jokes for the adults to appreciate and none of those confused or upset the children.  The zoo animals' conflicts about capturing food in the wild were presented in a slapstick comedy form for which the children are well accustomed after their usual dosage of Sponge Bob type of cartoon shows.  If the movie producers were trying to undermine the meat industry, as some critics seem to think, they failed with my family as we enjoyed a large barbecue after the show.  And the children talked about the movie and recounted jokes from the movie during dinner.

If you want a fun time for your children and yourself, I highly recommend this movie.  If you want to watch talk of hidden conspiracies, then watch the Fox News station.",1117411200,8,1185,4.685990338164252
1534771,1,B00005JNX0,"Have you ever gone into a movie theater, cleared out your mind of any nagging thoughts, and then said to yourself, ""I'm going to just try not to over-analyze this and have some popcorn-movie fun?""  And then, when the movie was about 30 minutes into it, you realized that you were so bored that you would actually prefer to just nitpick and be angry because over-analyzing the movie would be more fun than just kicking back?  That's how ""Madagascar"" is.  It's dull, boring, bland, insipid, and any other synonym you can think of.  Even the plot sounds like something an amateur kids' book author was trying to come up with:

""Hmm... how about Alex the Lion and Marty the Zebra try to escape the zoo?  That should be worth a lot of laughs!""

As a fun, breezy comedy, the movie fails in an astonishing way.  As a commentary on the conflicts of civilization versus nature and the ethics of vegetarianism, it's terrible, but at least it provides you with some good material to make fun of.  You know you're in trouble when you have more fun pointing out the lack of logic in a zany comedy than you have enjoying the zaniness.

The jokes in ""Madagascar"" can be divided chiefly into three categories: poo jokes, movie references, and slapstick.  The sad thing is, the poo jokes are actually the only funny parts of the movie, and there's only three or four of them.  The movie references are just dumb---they leave you wishing that the movie tried to parody other movies instead of simply referencing them.

The slapstick, which comprises roughly 85% of the movie, fails because it breaks one of the rules of comedy: wacky antics only work when you have at least one ""straight"" character.  Having two clowns jump all over the screen honking horns at each other and throwing pies into their faces isn't funny because they're both manic.  After a couple of seconds, ""manic"" becomes the norm and there's nothing left to surprise you.  Humor comes from something unusual or different that jumps out at you and you go, ""Wow, that was odd.  And funny!""  Instead of two clowns, you have two guys in business suits conducting a boring meeting in an office, and then one of them randomly pulls out a pie and throws it at the other.

""Madagascar"" ruins this by having nothing BUT manic characters.  There are no straight characters in the movie---everybody is full of too much energy.  The four main characters simply fight with each other for more attention from the camera, and instead of trying to do anything clever and funny, they just get more and more ""zany.""  It works for about two minutes before the movie just gets completely dull.

If you are a very young child, then you'll like all the flashy colors and the bounciness and wackiness.  You'll want to see it all again and again for hours.  But ""Madagascar"" is the sort of movie that you'll watch again when you've turned 23 and you'll say, ""Wow, I was stupid when I was a kid.""

The movie has one saving grace, which is unfortunately neglected.  The penguins steal the show; unlike the rest of the cast, the penguins switch off between being calm, collected, straight characters and over-the-top, zany, wacky characters.  They are consistently funny and also the most adorable of all the animals.  In every scene they appear, you wish that the movie was about them.  Unfortunately, they only have about four minutes of screen-time in total.  A true waste of a good concept.",1117324800,15,3419,4.676716917922948
1534772,2,B00005JNX0,"I saw the trailers for this and they were enough to tell me what each of the characters was like. I hoped and expected that the film itself would give me more; it really didn't. Most of the time, animated movies stand a good chance of giving me something to love about them even when, overall, they may not be so great. ""Shark Tale,"" for instance, never got the best reviews, but there's just something I love about it, despite the fact that I know it's not the best CG movie made. With ""Madagascar,"" all I can say is that I chuckled a few times. The characters all seemed very clich (there had to be the four friends--a hypochondriac, a smooth-talking joker who gets everyone in trouble, the joker's friend who's a bit of a ham but has slightly more brains, and a girl.) But I could tell all that from the trailers; I wanted something more that I never got. They are cute animals, I admit, but the movie is so entirely focused on the jokes, the humor, the references, that it completely lacks any kind of development, seriousness, or anything that would be powerful. Even when Alex discovers his inner predator, it goes by so fast that you don't feel much. And again, the humor is what the movie counts on to survive. And I honestly can't say that I would be interested in seeing it a second time, because the humor was not *that* hilarious. The penguins? Yes, they were somewhat amusing. But again, it was nothing more than what I expected from the trailers; and I didn't really expect much. The lemurs, while definitely funny, also didn't add a lot to the film besides humor. And they were the only native animals we really got to know. I also didn't care for the overly unrealistic animation style. I don't need photorealism, but if they're going to make Alex walk like a human and pose like a human in front of humans, well...there was nothing there to convince me that this was an animal character.

Once I realized that the movie wasn't going to turn into anything amazing, I stopped waiting for the greatness and just tried to enjoy the very, very simple story that it had. I suppose I did, but again, I wouldn't recommend it or exactly choose to rewatch it myself. In the end, it's not clear whether they returned to Central Park Zoo or not, since apparently the boat was out of gas. A cliffhanger like that is fine, I guess, but the movie didn't make me care enough about it to really appreciate that ending...nor do I eagerly anticipate a sequel. Overall, I felt the story itself was pretty simple (which in itself isn't a bad thing at all), but the way it was presented left much to be desired. It was carried all on the jokes, and nothing surprising or clever ever jumped out at me and pulled me into it. I suppose I could compare it to an extended TV cartoon. There's no question for me that Pixar's films, and almost all of Dreamworks' others, especially ""Shark Tale,"" are superior to ""Madagascar."" This movie, unfortunately, never exceeded the fairly low expectations I had set for it. Because it was a CG, animal-centric film, I figured that it couldn't possibly fail. But sadly, there was very little substance to it and I came away rather indifferent. I felt there was clumsiness in the way it was put together, carelessness in the making, and I do remember that at some point I began wondering when it was just going to be over.

Also...what was the moral? The city zoo was made out to be a tiny place where wild animals were kept in pens, surrounded by skyscrapers, and gawked at by people...but they were mostly happy there because of the pampering, health care, etc. And in the end they seemingly decide to do a bit of travel, then return to the zoo as long as they're together. I wasn't sure whether they were trying to say that the animals belonged in the wild, or that they couldn't inhabit it once they were in captivity for so long, or what. So I again concluded that the movie's only real point was to be lighthearted and full of jokes, jokes, jokes. Which was okay. I just didn't like it enough to want to see it again or to recommend it to others. It had potential, but came across as flat, redundant, or just generally not worthwhile.",1117324800,5,4166,4.465879265091863
1534773,3,B00005JNX0,"Madagascar features a bunch of animals, a lion, a zebra, a hippo and a
giraffe specifically who are well-fed and cared for in a city centre
zoo in New York. By day, there are stars of the zoo, performing
over-the-top stunts and attracting the crowd. That was until the 10th
birthday of Marty the zebra when he decided to do something with his
life by living his dream of being back in the wilderness. Inspired by a
few escaping penguins, he too left for Central Park station and by some strange twist of fate, all of them landed on Madagascar.

Like Shark Tale, the story borders on being a shallow tale. Some of the scenes like the animals taking the city subway and roaming the streets are just simply incredulous. Dialogs are sometimes banal or slapstick, although I must say the star of the voiceovers must be Chris Rock who brings his comedic persona into the character of Marty.

The scene where Marty and Alex meet on the beach after a near-shipwreck set against the Vangeli's Chariots of Fire is simply cheesy while the one with Alex mimicking the famous rose-dropping in American Beauty was top-notch.

In the end, I am not too sure if they are advocating that animals should be kept
in captivity so that they don't have to face the adverse conditions of the wilderness or we should celebrate the camaraderie between different spiecesthough the thought of a carnivorous animal thinking twice before savouring its prey in the wild is rather unthinkable. Perhaps you have todecide for yourself.

Well, there's still good - the music in the feature, especially the Ali G remake of Reel to Real's I Like To Movie It, does bring the feature out of its doldrums at the right time.",1117238400,3,1683,4.656565656565657

If you have kids this is a definite must see, we had kids laughing the whole time and most loved the bright colors, music and especially dancing.  You saw a lot of little kids dancing in their chairs.  People without kids or older kids will also enjoy the movie as it has a lot of jokes for adults to keep us entertained and laughing; the bright colors are also great for us as well as the dancing and music.
