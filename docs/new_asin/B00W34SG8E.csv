7118538,5,B00W34SG8E,"Alert! This concert runs about 2 hours, not the 60 minutes reported by Amazon. Great performance by Melissa, but found the sound mix lacking on blu-ray. The snare drum was a loud and annoying distraction throughout. Still give 5 stars overall.",1436227200,,243,4.951219512195122
7118539,5,B00W34SG8E,Excellent bluray.  PQ and AQ are very good..  Great song set.,1435881600,4,61,4.454545454545454
7118540,5,B00W34SG8E,Awesome show. This is a must buy. You will not be disappointed.,1435881600,,63,4.333333333333333
7118541,5,B00W34SG8E,"Right now I'm so jazzed I feel like dancing all night! I can't imagine how high my adrenaline level could go if I ever saw Melissa perform in person! This DVD with accompanying CD is one of the best music concerts I've ever seen. I have enjoyed ME' s music for years from a distance - making comparisons to the late Janis Joplin - the original rocker chick - minus some of the vocal gravel. Etheridge has demonstrated on this video what's keeping crowds coming back year after year. I agree with another reviewer's statement that ""Monster"" should have been included on the CD. This set is definitely a good investment for fans and for those who want to rock out in their homes.",1434672000,7,677,4.467741935483871
7118542,5,B00W34SG8E,"She is so incredible, a perfect show with great sound and picture

7118546,5,B00W34SG8E,"I saw Melissa in concert in July. The show was so awesome I decided to buy this DVD based on her ""A Little Bit of me Tour."" The only thing better than this DVD is seeing her person! The energy & enthusiasm she showed on stage comes through on this DVD recorded in L.A.

I highly recommend this DVD for Melissa Etheridge fans. If you get the chance to see her in person, do it!  Melissa still rocks it!",1438646400,2,401,4.063291139240507
7118547,4,B00W34SG8E,Great video! Melissa plays her new & old songs. I didn't care for the group she had come out and sing with her backup singers. The one girl was absolutely annoying to me but besides that loved it!,1437782400,,196,4.184210526315789

7118549,4,B00W34SG8E,"CD is great. BlueRay disc is area/zone code A: not playable outside USA! I live in Europe, so I'm not able to play it!",1437436800,,118,3.9583333333333335
7118550,5,B00W34SG8E,I went to this show so I was very interested in seeing the DVD from that night.  The DVD is great but I was disappointed that several of my favorite songs had been cut.  I pre-ordered it and at that time they did not have a song list online so I didn't get to see what was on it until I watched it.  It is nice that they also included the audio version on CD as well as the DVD of the show. Well worth the money.,1437350400,,412,3.7126436781609193

8711918,5,B00W34SG8E,This is the first Melissa album I have purchased and I am glad I did.  I am not a hard rock fan so I choose my rock albums very carefully.  This album satisfies the type of rock music I enjoy.  Great melodic music. Now that I know what to expect I will follow her music more closely.,1449014400,,283,3.9298245614035086
