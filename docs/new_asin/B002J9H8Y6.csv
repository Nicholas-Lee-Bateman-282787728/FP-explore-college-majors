3937626,1,B002J9H8Y6,"I was really looking forward to this DVD and I was very disappointed.  The Morgans' videography is subpar - they do not know where to place a camera to photograph a ride with any kind of impact, the editing is amateurish and repetitive (did they really have to show the same ferris wheel 6 times at Cypress Gardens?!), and the music was annoying.  The Freedomland footage was acceptable because it was a promo film for the park.  On a positive note, the archival footage of Coney Island finally gave me the chance to see the Virginia Reel, Flying Turns and Gyroscope rides in action, but no Steeplechase ride footage and no Thunderbolt footage?",1293321600,,644,4.68141592920354
3937627,3,B002J9H8Y6,"The vintage footage is wonderful. However, it would have been nice to have some narration about the scenes and the separate parks instead of just subtitles listing some facts. I'm only really knowledgeable about Disney parks and did notice an error. They called the Submarine Voyage attraction 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. This makes me wonder how many other mistakes were made. I also got very tired of the generic music that was playing and finally turned the sound off. With that all said, I think it's still worth the $10 for the vintage footage alone.",1275350400,3,557,4.8125
3937628,4,B002J9H8Y6,"This DVD was packed -- most documentaries that I've bought were usually 30 to 45 minutes long.  I can't
believe they got so much stuff on this DVD.  The only thing I didn't like is much of the information
is presented in Subtitles (kinda like VH1's ""Popup Video"" show) --I would have preferred a narrator.
The footage from Coney Island and Disney World in the 1960s was great.  They had some stuff from
defunct Cypress Gardens and Freedomland, too.  If you are a theme park junkie -- you'll probably
like it.",1256342400,8,508,4.549450549450549

8371316,2,B002J9H8Y6,"I had high hopes for this film, but it didn't deliver.  I give it two stars only because it presented some vintage footage of a few theme parks, but the camera work was so bad and went from jump cut to jump cut making it frustrating to watch.  At times, you were given trivia bits about different attractions, but the text wasn't left on the screen long enough to read all the way through the paragraph.  The music used for the soundtrack was a bit dated and annoying for the ears.  Simply put...this film comes off looking like somebody's boring home movie, and lacks the professional level of polish that you would expect when renting or buying a documentary.",1410566400,,661,4.529411764705882
8371317,2,B002J9H8Y6,"The subtitles was too fast.
Some of the scenes was repeated.
overall just not fun like I thought it would.",1364515200,,106,4.35
8371318,1,B002J9H8Y6,"I wouldn't call this a documentary.  It is just home movie footage set to stock music with occasional text describing some of the content.  It is not a review of ""the turbulent history of many lost attractions"" nor the ""history of the World's Fair and its influence on modern theme parks"" as the DVD cover claims. The footage is poor and the majority of it contains no narrative or voice over.  The only segment worth looking at is a commercial for Freedomland that can be viewed on YouTube.  Don't waste your money on purchasing this DVD.  If you do, you will greatly be disappointed.",1325980800,,585,4.586538461538462
8371319,2,B002J9H8Y6,"We were so excited to see this movie.  My wife is writing a book on vintage amusement parks, so we thought this would a lot of fun.
OK. So, we'll start with the good stuff.
There truly is some great footage.  Wonderful vintage Disneyland, Coney Island, and the World's Fair of 1964, and then a bunch of parks in Florida.  Apparently that's all that was available.
Well, that's it for the good stuff.
The new footage is fine, I'm guessing filmed for the video program itself, although some strange shots that don't feel like they add to the park.
And then we come to the editing.  Sometimes it feels like there is some sort of a narrative going on--starting early in the morning, the rides are empty, the park is just starting up, then the crowds come in, everyone's having fun, and then the evening arrives, the lights turn on and eventually everyone goes home happy and the park goes to sleep once again.  And that would be nice, except the editing doesn't stick to that formula.  I'm not talking about from park to park (which sometimes is just a tour of the area, ride by ride) no, I mean that ""Day in the Park"" theme is broken several times in the same park.  The editing is horribly smashed together.  Sometimes an attempt to break up the shots in some artistic way, that doesn't really make sense, others are long static shots that go on and on and don't make sense either.
There is a little audio included, but it's only from the original ""promo"" of the park.  Otherwise, there are some fairly interesting trivia notes provided by way of white subtitles.
Problem #1: many of the trivia postings do not remain on the screen long enough for anyone to read them in their entirity.  Even Evelyn Woods herself would be continually pausing the cd to catch up.
Problem #2: when you have white subtitles on a light blue sky from old movies, it's near impossible to read.  The lovely production team thought to include a drop shadow to help with that, only the shadow is very light and distanced too far from the words to highlight them in any beneficial way.
Problem #3: There really aren't nearly enough trivia and information included.  True there is some really neat stuff explained and revealed, some of which we all went, ""Oh, that's cool."" but then there were long stretches of interesting rides and locations that we wanted to know more about, and there was nothing.
Problem #4: spelling and grammatical errors.  Which might not have been so much of a problem if it weren't for everything else horribly wrong.

And then there's the music.
Oh, the music.  Sadly, because there was a little bit of narrative somewhere in the early part and in the middle, we were tricked into leaving the audio on all the time instead of muting it.  (If you get this, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE listen only to the audio on I think the second park ""Freedomland"" and then for the love of Pete, shut off the sound.  Or better yet, use your own music. Really, there are over 10,000 possible alternatives to choose from.  Think about it, vintage amusement parks, many showing footage from the 50s and 60s, and even into the 70s and 80s.  Amusement parks, right?  So right off the bat, just think of what music you would like to pair with that, and then GO BUY IT so you'll have something to play while watching this.
The only thing I can guess is that one of the producers had a friend who had a cd of leftover 80s instrumental heavy metal space rock that even the 80s didn't accept.  The 80s!!! And there was some serious crappy music in the 80s.  This music makes that crappy music seem like a Mozart symphony.
There is also ABSOLUTELY no attention to the music placement.  It just ends whenever the song ends, and the next one begins, no matter what's happening with the video portion.  Truly, it's like the editors just tossed all the video into the air and pieced it all together in whatever order they fell (thankfully keeping the parks separate) and then pushed PLAY on the cd that ""The Artist formally known as Doug"" created in his basement with a TS-2000 synthesizer and then they put a couple cool pictures on it and charged money for it.
I'm all for the little guy, and I'm all for people making their own buck, and I'm usually very supportive and forgiving, but this is tragic.  The only reason it gets two stars (cause I can't do negative stars, right?  Right?  I mean, can I?  If I can, then I'll change my rating) is because there truly is some wonderful footage from magical places of long ago.  If you're a great fan of the amusement era, there is some great rare stuff, but know what you're getting.",1325116800,,4595,4.509047044632087
8371320,1,B002J9H8Y6,what a pitiful pathetic excuse for a documentary. random unedited home videos are NOT a documentary. A waste of time and money. don't buy this garbage. I don't care how big a theme park nerd you are.... DO NOT BUY THIS RUBBISH,1315008000,2,226,4.404761904761905
8371321,4,B002J9H8Y6,"There are some problems as mentioned in previous reviews:
No narration, just sub titles; color footage of the 1939 N.Y. Worlds Fair stated as being the 1964 N.Y. Worlds Fair. (Which would mean that the parachute jump only operated 3 years at Coney Island) However, the color footage of the 1939 N.Y. Worlds Fair is amazing footage. The DVD also includes great early footage of the defunct ""Freedom Land"" not to mention early footage of Disneyland. Lots of fun footage to watch.",1296000000,,477,4.829268292682927
8371322,2,B002J9H8Y6,"There is a lot of interesting footage here, but the historical inaccuracies are appalling for an alleged documentary.  The most glaring was for the New York Worlds Fair of 1964.  The footage of the fair construction was narrated from an old newsreel, but the following color footage was of the 1939 Worlds Fair (great footage).  Unfortunately the captions refer to this as the 1964 Worlds Fair.  They even claim the parachute jump was from the 1964 World's Fair!  It certainly was not.  The panoramas of the rides in the fun zone are captioned with misinformation about Walt Disney using the rides in Disneyland.  Wrong again about that date.

The segment of Boardwalk and Baseball the defunct park in Florida fails to mention that it was build from the remains of Circus World, yet another failed park.  Just a nice it of historical trivia that could have been used and wasn't.

Overall, not much of a documentary, but fun footage if you ignore the captions.",1293667200,,959,4.7926829268292686
