4082270,5,B0037TVOD8,My son loves fireman Sam and has watched this movie over and over without getting bored. It is a suitable show for a 4 year old to watch. We often take the iPad on long car trips and this is always the first movie my son will select to watch. It also is a good medium to use to talk with your children about how firefighters help people and general fire safety information. Our son now knows what to do when he hears the fire alarm. He even told us at school that the teacher did not know to leave the building when the fire alarm went off at school. He was so proud that he knew just what to do in such a situation and was not afraid if there was or wasn't a fire.,1453420800,3,665,3.8970588235294117

4082277,4,B0037TVOD8,"As far as animated shows for kids go, this one isn't that bad since we watch it a little more regularly (every other day) that I would prefer.  The animation is OK.  The plot is OK, but it does make you wonder how someone in a town like Pontypandy is able to get insurance. I mean people are starting fires, getting swept out to sea, or injuring themselves with shocking regularity.  It's probably a good thing there aren't more people in  Pontypandy since I doubt the three fireman could keep up.  One thing that is annoying about the show is that they decided to overdub the original voices for some strange reason.  They've done it with show and the other Fireman Sam shows which is bizarre since we are all speaking English, right?",1450137600,,735,4.488721804511278

Although suspenseful, it got my kid a little alarmed at first.  He got over it, but be cautious if you have a younger kid or one who is sensitive to scary situations on TV.

My three-year-old son is hooked on Fireman Sam, which we are streaming for free with Prime.  The movies are great because the series episodes are only 11 minutes long, meaning I have to start them up over and over again.

It just doesn't make any sense to eliminate the British accents when the show is so obviously set in the UK.  I think it is disrespectful to the original show and, while almost assuredly done to appeal to the American audience, I think it actually does us a disservice.

It's a kid's show, and it teaches responsibility as well as fire safety procedures and so much more.

Next time you see your local firefighters, tell them a massive thank you for being YOUR heroes next door.

Fireman Sam is a powerful and valuable teaching tool no matter what the language. Anyone who wants to know how to be safe around fire, and learn about safety, lifesaving procedures, and what causes disasters will inevitably enjoy and learn from this incredible show.

I know I do, and I'm 21 years old!

Adult or child, you can learn much from Fireman Sam.

Sam, his crew, Tom Thomas and the helicopter from Mountain Rescue, and Nurse Flood are all part of a team that works together flawlessly, like a well-oiled machine, to save the lives of all.

Everything said or done in this show is true for firefighting and rescue operations anywhere on earth.

Internationally, firefighting and emergency response follows the same procedures; whether stateside or abroad.

My lesson for the day is, never mind the voices of the responders, pay attention to the procedures they follow.

4082442,1,B0037TVOD8,"This gets 1 star for the voiceover. Kids loved the story and the video, but the dubbing into American accents is AWFUL. Seriously, who did the voiceovers and are they actual Americans? The accents are so terrible - as if one (tone-deaf) person without talent tried to mimic a Southern good 'ole boy accent, a New Jersey accent, a Boston accent and more. I much preferred the original voices with their awesome Welsh accents. Not sure why the change was needed, it was part of the charm of the series.  Maybe they could offer a choice to listen without the dubbing? It's pretty much ruined it for my family.",1413417600,7,606,4.559633027522936

4082449,1,B0037TVOD8,I don't know why they changed the voices. My son is used to watching Fireman Sam with the British voices and he noticed right away that there was a difference. He won't even sit down for this Fireman Sam with the American voices. The story line isn't as entertaining when you picture the town of Pontypandy in the US.,1410393600,19,317,4.389830508474576
