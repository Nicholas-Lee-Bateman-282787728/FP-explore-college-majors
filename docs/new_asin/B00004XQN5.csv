View them alongside Leni Riefenstahl's 'Triumph of the Will' which  is being released by Synapse, and see how totally opposed propaganda  viewpoints created cinematic history.  These Eisenstein movies created a  new kind of cinema -- operatic cinema, each frame carefully composed for  great rhetorical effect.

The battles scene are among the best ever filmed the music is top notch the songs are great the germans holy hymns included the infamous scene with babies and fire is still there and the fact that crusaders make the prefect bad guys armour overdone helmets and overuse of the cross make for best of all hack and slash films much better than conan the barbarian or braveheart in my mind.,1331942400,,1189,4.639810426540285
1369471,3,B00004XQN5,"Ivan the Terrible Parts I & II:

By the time he made ""Ivan the Terrible"" Eisenstein had moved from employing film montage juxtapositions to creating juxtapositions within the frame so the feel of the movie is very different from his early films. Between that change in style and the high contract lighting and the overwrought pantomime acting style, ""Ivan"" looks almost like a parody of an early silent film - despite being a talkie. Add to that the mostly static framing, the majestic but often sparsely furnished sets, the elegant and sometimes extreme looking costumes and hair and I was often reminded of nothing so much as the old Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials I watched on television as a kid - but with Ming the Merciless as the hero - and without much of the action.

Not unrewarding, but not the Eisenstein I would recommend.

Alexander Nevsky:

""Alexander Nevsky"" is a spectacularly staged 1938 historical drama about the attempted invasion of Novgorod, Russia by the Germanic Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire in 1242 and how they were defeated by the indomitable Russian people led by Alexander Nevsky. The characters are all two dimensional but nicely photographed, as is most everything. The battle is difficult and prolonged and I ponder the number of actual injuries inflicted during its recreation. There is a bit of comic relief contributed by two of Nevsky's commanders who vie for the hand of a particular maiden - which leads to a moment which is cleverly both touching and funny at the end of the film.

When the Russian people ultimately withstand the invasion, Eisenstein's  Nevsky prophetically proclaims; ""Go tell all in foreign lands that Russia lives! Those who come to us in peace will be welcome as a guest. But those who come to us sword in hand will die by the sword! On that Russia stands and forever will we stand!"" Within a few years would come a new assault by Hitler's German forces which the Russian people again withstood at great cost.

A reasonably good historical drama elevated by its historical importance.",1322697600,5,2065,4.849431818181818
1369472,5,B00004XQN5,"This review covers both Parts I & II of ""Ivan the Terrible"", for the sake of brevity, and also because I consider this to be one complete film (especially since Part III was never completed).  ""Ivan"" is indeed a ""ballet with a script"" containing an encyclopaedic amount of multi-leveled visual information.  It often appears that the actors are being choreographed (in the supplemental material in this collection, it is revealed that Eisenstein often instructed the actors to make animal-like movements).  The influence of Kabuki can also be seen in regard to said choreography--and this staging of the players by Eisenstein is yet another element contributing to the magic of the film.  There are so many highlights in ""Ivan"" that must be mentioned: (1) the omnipresent, larger-than life frescoes that create an atmosphere of menace, as if the characters are being tracked by spirits; (2) the baroque hyper-stylized, extravagance of every visual detail, IE (A) the expressionistic lighting and shadows; flames flickering outside of crescent-shaped windows; (B) the fantastic thick-walled interiors of the palace featuring the curved arches of doorways; (C) set pieces including sculptured ornamentation, over sized goblets, elaborate candelabras, golden roosters and white swans; (D) sinister icons of Christ, IE one that is framed in the arc of a candlelit alcove, with two guards with crescent-shaped axes standing to the right of that icon; (3) Ivan being showered with coins at his coronation in ""The Great Hall"" at the beginning of the film, with shafts of light falling across the court in the background; (4) the shadow of Ivan's devilish profile on the wall, as he plots his strategy against the Baltic states, and in the same scene, the gyroscopic shadow of a globe representing Ivan's geopolitical ambitions; (5) Ivan's wedding feast with its joyously militant Prokofievian choruses; (6) the bells, chimes and softer choirs that embellish the conspiratorial whispers and tetes a tetes between members of the court, as they speculate on Ivan's latest maneuver for power; (7) the lurid pinks, reds, greens and blacks of Chapter 17, ""Dance of the Oprichniki"" (that scene subsequently transforming into Vladimir's ""Anti-Coronation"").

Nikolai Cherkasov gives a finely nuanced performance, vividly revealing Ivan's various tortured states of mind.  Eisenstein made Ivan--as ruthless as he could be--not only a grandly compelling character, but also one with whom the viewer can readily empathize.  To quote Joan Neuberger from the ""The History of Ivan"" in the supplemental material on CD 1, ""Ivan is child and father, rational and mad, progressive and destructive"".  Other notable performances include those by Serafima Birman as Efrosinia Staritskaya (a kind of ""Wicked Witch of the West"" transplanted into a medieval Russian context); Pavel Kadochinikov as Efrosinia's effeminate son Vladimir Staritsky; Mikhail Zarov as Malyuta Skuratov, the ""Eye of the Czar""; and the powerful Andrei Abrikosov as Philip the Metropolitan (formerly Fyodor Kolychev).  Eisenstein wisely chose these actors, as well as others in the film, for the expressive power of their faces.  Excellent supplemental material is featured on both CDs of this collection--highlights include an analysis of Eisenstein's visual vocabulary by Yuri Tsivian on CD 2; Joan Neuberger's ""History of Ivan"" focuses on Eisenstein's melding of the personal and the political in creating the film.  The following quote by Neuberger succinctly captures the essence of ""Ivan"": ""Ivan the Terrible is a film structured by dualisms, reversals, and mirrors because it tells a story rooted in contradictions and is filled with divided souls.  It features people who are never what they seem to be, and who change shape before our very eyes.""

A separate review for ""Alexander Nevsky"" appears among my other Amazon reviews.

1369473,5,B00004XQN5,"Segei Eisenstein is the ultimate director first in silent films and then with sound.  I would put him on a par with Alfred Hitchcock.  Battleship Potemkin, Alexander Nievksy, Ivan the Terrible.  One could teach an entire course on filmmaking from these three movies.  The use of shadows, facial expressions, costumes, dialogue and music are beyond compare.  One likens these to the Maltese Falcom and the living room scene when the sun comes up and the lamps are turned off as Sideny Greenstreet closes the book he is reading.  These three movies deserve their place in the ""Movie Hall of Fame"" (if there is such a thing.)  P.S. I got my first viewing of these three movies on PBS with commentary by academic experts.  I wish they would bring out a DVD of these movies with the PBS commentators on it.  I would get them in an instant.  An Eisenstein fan from Stony Point, New York.",1298246400,4,881,4.625806451612903
1369474,5,B00004XQN5,"Sergei Eisenstein is trumpeted around film-buff circles as a legendary genius. If you're like me, you're leery of the term, as it usually means that their films are really not worth watching anymore. Sometimes, what they did may have been revolutionary for the time, but has now been so adopted by the film industry as to become mere standard fare. High praise, to be sure, but it doesn't light up your world. This was how I perceived Eisenstein after watching ""The Battleship Potemkin."" It's an ok story, but clearly propaganda and the final sequence might be truly moving if it hadn't been aped so many times throughout film history as to become a cliche.

I know different now.

Alexander Nevsky is a great film, loaded with anti-German propaganda but also compelling action sequences and symbolism. The real treasure, though, is Ivan the Terrible.

If you ever wondered just how many ways a story can be told in a feature film, Ivan the Terrible is the film you need to see. The effect is fascinating: the moods, fears, neuroses and schemes are revealed with shadows, lighting, frescoes on walls, body positions and so much more. The visual scenery is so dense that that everything means something, but at the same time, it is clear enough that you can perceive most of it. Ivan the Terrible is truly Eisenstein at the peak of his powers. It is too bad he never got to finish his masterpiece-what we have is already a film for the ages. I marvel at what could have been if only he'd lived.",1254182400,7,1493,4.6477272727272725
1369475,5,B00004XQN5,"Eisenstein's last film is his most visually dense, with every shot and costume and motion and set immaculately composed and every cut creating deeper resonance for the image that came before it. This is the cinematic equivalent of opera, weird and stylized and extravagant and completely un-real... it creates its own set of rules that have very little to do with the conventional rules of film. That's why it's my favorite film, but that's also why a lot of people are bored/disoriented by it.",1204243200,2,494,4.892857142857143

It is especially in the increasingly suspicious atmosphere of Ivan that one can begin to appreciate why Stalin eventually stopped further work - it was definitely too close to home!

1369478,5,B00004XQN5,"From the cinematography to the set design, costumes to character detail, Eisenstein's operatic sound epics are world-class examples of film as high art, with vigorous storytelling adding to the dazzling, still unparalleled craftsmanship of his historic handiwork. ""Nevsky,"" made in 1938, revived the director's flagging career, and earned him a spot as head of Mosfilm Studios. Stalin was less pleased with Part II of ""Ivan,"" especially with its allusions to his use of secret police and unflattering portrayal of a leader in distress. Both ""Nevsky"" and ""Ivan"" star the chiseled, charismatic Cherkasov (a sort of Russian Gary Cooper), and boast magnificent set pieces: a battle on a frozen lake involving thousands of extras in ""Nevsky,"" and an orgiastic feast (rendered in color) in ""Ivan."" You'd never expect cinema this lavish or lively outside classic Hollywood, but here it is, courtesy of an idealistic Communist in full command of his actors and material.",1182470400,3,962,5.3355263157894735

One thing it lacks is an accompanying commentary track for the films themselves, done by those same scholars.

1369481,3,B00004XQN5,"Reportedly filmed it Stalin's personal suggestion, Part I glorified the 16th century prince who overcame the power of Russia's feudal lords and the treachery of his own friends and family to forge the Russian nation... Although Ivan resorted to cruel and often repugnant means to achieve his goals, the end results, at least in Eisenstein's eyes, made the means acceptable...

Condemned by some critics as unbearably slow and ponderous, Part I of ""Ivan the Terrible"" is regarded by others as a towering work of genius... It is easy to understand why Stalin, one of the most ruthless of leaders, approved the first half of the epic; it is equally easy to see why Part II, completed in 1946, was banned by an irate government...

Far less effective than Part I, it shows Peter becoming increasingly insane, overwhelmed by hate, bitterness, and doubt as to the legitimacy of his mission... Eisenstein suffered a heart attack on the day he completed editing the film, and he died in 1948... For a decade thereafter his completed masterwork remained under official proscription; it received its first screening in 1958, five years after Stalin's death...",1167609600,2,1149,5.042105263157895
1369482,4,B00004XQN5,"I'm only telling you about the Nevsky DVD here - my local library has a copy of it, and that was all i got to see.
Terrific transfer - firstly. The film's look, like with Ivan, is its greatest attribute - and here it looks incredible. The images are just so clear, i couldn't believe it. You can fully appreciate the brilliance and purity of Eistenstein's cinema.
Sound quality was good.
Special features were particularly good (as usual). Audio commentary and tidbits from film historians and critics. Most interesting was a reconstruction from stills and titlecards of Eistenstein's unfinished/lost pastoral film Bezhin Meadows. This is the only place you'll get to see this. And i was quite impressed by it. There are some striking images in there, similar to some compositions from Nevsky.
Unlike Ivan (which i have seen Part I of, but not on this DVD) in my opinion, Nevsky does not suffer from a creaky plot, but has good unity and good progression to the climax of the battle of the ice. Part love triangle, part battle epic, Nevsky feels wearisome in places for how very much it is soviet propaganda. In both films, the performances are unusual, because they are more like silent performances, which would have been poetic in a silent, but definitely look quirky in a sound movie.
If i had any complaints it would be these:
one for Eisenstein, for his sound engineer, for the terrible job he did of constructing the sound for the battle on the ice. I could hear the foley artist literally clanking a whole lot of swords together rhythmically. Very distracting indeed.
one for Criterion: i would not have subtitled every line of the singing. Nevsky and Ivan are both part Eisenstein movie, part Prokofiev opera. But the lyrics of the songs the people/army are constantly singing in the background of Nevsky get very repetitive, because its the same verse over and over. Continually reinforcing this propagandising message of unity. And i'm sure its the same for Ivan, but the release i saw of Ivan didn't continue to subtitle every line of song, which is why i know this was a much better option.
Otherwise, a beautiful DVD edition (of Nevsky) with an incredible image and good special features.",1081900800,7,2202,4.7973684210526315
1369483,5,B00004XQN5,"""Ivan the Terrible Parts I and II"" is a film of greatness, so great in fact that after seeing it only once I would probably include it among the ten finest films I have ever seen. It is a work of bold compositions (visual, aural, verbal, rhythmic, textural, political, etc.) arranged into a dense and exciting network of sensual and intellectual information. The interaction of motifs and ideas, symbolism and iconography into a sort of cinematic Russian fresco is absolutely thrilling. This often has a bizarre effect. The actor's movements are so deliberate as to be completely alien; after all, these are not human beings, they are representations of human beings on a screen, like portraits on a canvas, an idea which adds greatly to the purity of the film's artifice (of course, this is actually even more complex, having something to do with biomechanics, a theory I know too little of to discuss here). The film is completely engrossing, and is really a treasure trove hidden references and information, which really makes it fascinating.  Honestly, I can not praise this film enough. It is grandiose and spectacular, a stunning work of depth and complexity.
  ""Alexander Nevsky"" on the other hand would seem to be a very simple film, simple to the point of being stupid. In fact it is very complex (if not quite so much as ""Ivan""), and only seems stupid because of a ridiculous political purpose and mindset that weighs it down. Its embarrassingly propagandistic, and politically compromised, something which greatly dulls the films underlying brilliance. ""Ivan"" is a complete reversal and a far superior film, at least in my view, in that it is able to subvert political expectancies, transforming what was intended as Stalinist propaganda into a disguised Stalinist and Communist critique, even lament. ""Nevsky"" lacks this independence, and while it is still fascinating as a work of form, structure, and motif (among many other Eisenstinean devices) it is ultimately too compromised to be as great a piece of art as ""Ivan.""
  In spite of that, Criterion's treatment of both films (or three, depending on how you look at it) is absolutely grand. The transfers, aside from some rather rough spots on ""Nevsky,"" are really quite good, the extras are fascinating and deeply insightful, and the packaging is far more attractive than it looks on amazon's picture. I probably own around 20 or more discs by Criterion, and all absolutely fantastic packages, but this one is the best! Absolutely one of the most solid purchases you'll ever make! And it's so wonderful to see these kind of films being given the royal treatment usually reserved for the more recent, popular, and... cough-shallow-cough releases. Long live The Criterion Collection, and God bless the soul of Sergei Eisenstein!
P.S. Oh, and God bless Sergei Prokofiev, composer of these films' beautiful and justly renowned musical scores.",1040947200,31,2904,5.066945606694561
1369484,3,B00004XQN5,"'Ivan The Terrible', the story of the first true Russian tsar, is Eisenstein's most theatrical film - with a couple of brief exceptions, every scene takes place indoors, with the theatrical space and decor hanging turgidly over the dehumanised human action.  Long rhetorical speeches are performed by actors with grotesquely stylised movements and poses, oritund declamation and popping eyes.  Whispering consists of shouting in crowded, silent halls.  This already static film (which seems closer to Shakespeare's history plays and Russian opera like 'Boris Godunov' than cinema) often petrifies into interminable tableaux.  All this barnstorming and grandstanding seems more Victorian than we'd expect from a modernist master.  It's all thematically relevant of course - like Shakespeare, Eisenstein is concerned to analyse the politicking, the construction of symbolism and myth behind apparently 'natural' official pomp.  If this is a Shakespeare history play, though, it's more 'Richard II' than 'Henry IV', a talkative, humorless pageant (with the exception of one bizarrely homoerotic scene in a chessboard-tiled throne-room, where a traitor unsheathes his sword for the Polish King, who fondles and returns it for a kiss).
'Part 2' is famous for having two reels shot in colour, but their quality is over-rated; shot in seeping orange and neon blue, their drunken revels aren't exactly 'An American In Paris', and having convicingly created a 16th century world with compositions that echo carved woodcuts, tapestries, paintings etc. the move into more modern, 'abstract' colour is an unsatisfying shock.  Motifs that worked brilliantly in monochrome - the swans, the disapproving religious murals, the black cowls of the priests - lose all their definition and impact in colour, and to regain its power and suspense, the film has to return to black and white.
For a confirmed classic of World Cinema, 'Terrible' is an easy film to dislike, and even mock (you have to see some of these beards).  With the exception of a couple of crowd-scenes recalling the montage-frenzy of earlier classics like 'Battleship Potemkin' or 'October', this slow film depends for its dynamics too often on Prokofiev's amazing score, with its mixture of pastiche and commentary, scuttling action and brooding menace, even wistful emotion - this music is perhaps irretrievably lost judging by the poor soundtrack on this otherwise essential DVD set.
'Alexander Nevsky' opens brilliantly on a plain of warrior skeletons, but as the film continues, you understand that the idea is less the futility of war than the futility of invading Russia.  The oppressive stench of propaganda - the film, made in a period when Hitler was expanding eastwards in the search for Living Space, shows 13th century Rus discarding internal struggles, uniting under a saintly, strong leader, and defeating the bucket-visored Huns (as allegories go, it's not exactly subtle) - is not the only reason to baulk at this unlovely film.  Like 'Ivan', it is faithful not just to the historical look of its period (costumes, buildings, language [here translated into the silliest cod medieval Yoda-speak], but its representational modes also, in this case the Scandanavian warrior sagas, with their formal speeches and boasts, their breaks for chants, marches and laments, their insistence on lineage etc.  After the relentless interiority of 'Ivan', the sunny outdoors of 'Nevsky' is a great relef, but Eisenstein's narrative still proceeds by an accumulation of static, exhaustingly 'awesome' tableaux, in the rather tedious manner of late Kurosawa.  The battle-sequence itself offers intriguing tensions, balancing a view of combat as a graceless mass squabble with individual feats of heroism - the result is ridiculous and endless.  Individual scenes are staged with magnificent power, especially the massacre of Russian villages, the Huns burning babies while scaffolds loom in the smoke and humiliated prisoners litter the square.  The pre-battle sequence is a remarkable feat of logistics, geometry and space, the two armies dehumanised as ominous lines on a vast landscape.  There is a marvellously funny shot that seems like a parody of 'Lawrence Of Arabia' a quarter-century before it was even made, as two riders emerge from dots in the snowy wastes, racing towards the camera, only for one to slip on the ice! Unlike 'Ivan', the irritating lead performance is marginal and emblematic; once again, Prokofiev's multi-layered score is the film's saving grace.",1022025600,15,4525,5.416785206258891

1369488,5,B00004XQN5,"Alexander Nevsky is a lively pro-Soviet propaganda piece partially intended as a warning to Hitler at the time not to invade Russia.  The epic battle on the frozen lake is justly famous and the sheer scope of the logistics of filming are impressive.  Some of the characters are somewhat cliche stock creations of the time including the two soldiers fighting for the love of one woman who must prove themselves in battle, but overall it's a modest success.
The real prize in this three film Criterion set however is of course Ivan the Terrible parts 1 and 2, a great masterpiece, Eisenstein's most ""enjoyable"" film(s) and indeed one of the oddest works to emerge from Soviet cinema of the time.  Highly expressionistic visuals combine with a melodramatic (and slightly revisionist) take of Ivan's life to create one of the stranger filmic experiences one will see.  Eisenstein clearly had a very highly developed visual style and the numerous extreme close-ups of faces are extraordinary as are the sets and costumes.  Part 2 doesn't quite live up to the promise of part 1 but nevertheless brings the characters to an appropriate conclusion.  Bizarrely humorous (perhaps unintentionally at times) Ivan is nevertheless a film more for afficionados than for the casual viewer looking for another classic in the mould of Casablanca.
Regarding the transfers, they are superb and anyone expecting better prints is simply not being realistic regarding the age of the material and the conditions in which they were kept.  While not as pristine looking as other recent releases of 40's films on DVD such as Shadow of a Doubt or Monsieur Hulot's Holiday they are more than adequate considering given the circumstances.",990144000,44,1708,5.056939501779359

In Alexander Nevsky, you almost feel like you are watching a Prokofiev score, rather than just watching a movie.

7926342,5,B00004XQN5,"Hard to describe why a genius work is worthy or why it is important, watch it carefully, listen to the music, enjoy at the amazing actors, remember that it was made bravely under Stalin boots and whips and that the second part almost got lost because of that scoundrel, (who probably had good reasons to see himself depicted) ...and after that just add it to your collection, it is a master piece!!!",1420416000,,399,4.555555555555555

7926346,5,B00004XQN5,"EXCELLENT TRANSTER FOR AN EARLY CRITERION RELEASE.

I DOUBT CRITERION USED DIFFERENT PICTURE QUALITY FOR EISENSTEIN'S WORKS.

IF NOT MY MISTAKE, I'M SURE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IVAN THE TERRIBLE BE PUBLISHED IN HIGH DEFINITION, AND UNCUT VERSION ALL OVER THE WORLD.

THE CHAPTERS SWITCH AND COMMENTARIES ARE REALLY PRECIOUS AND RARE. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.",1355270400,2,355,5.418181818181818
