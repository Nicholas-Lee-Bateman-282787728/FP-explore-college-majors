7812222,4,6301540743,"Yngwies Trial by Fire live VHS video was the perfect counterpoint to both the audio album of the same name but also the late 80's era of the mans career. The second Yngwie live video has a number of advantages over the earlier Live '85 release and that is the broader pallette of music the man was able to draw on. On his earlier release he only had his almost totally instrumental debut and the (admittedly brilliant) Marching Out to draw upon, meaning we got some Alcatrazz material as well. Here Yngwie had his equally excellent Trilogy album to draw from as well as Odyssey.

The production values on this concert compiled from footage of the mans tour of the USSR - still largely a closed market in the pre glasnost days- are not too bad, once again Yngwies predilection for simple stage presentations is on display. The highly successful tour not only has a good vibe, but the band at this point are pretty handy too. Long time collaborators the Johansson brothers on drums and keys with Barry Dunaway on bass and lead vox courtesy of Joe Lyn Turner, who probably got the gig solely because he's worked with Yngwies idol Blackmore. Sniping aside, the man puts in a highly useful performance here and shows his abilities in not only interpreting live the songs from the Odyssey album but also the earlier material from Trilogy.

The music on this release is more in the hard rock vein than that of purely metal as per the Live '85 release and is very indicative of Yngwies direction at the time. Interspersed between the `normal' songs are the inevitable instrumentals, at this point in his career they were still interesting and they do at least book end the tunes with vocals on them.

General rock fans may not get their boat floated by Yngwies fairly one dimensional guitar attack but at this point in his career he really had the tunes to sally forth with a great set of numbers. On VHS there can't be many of these circulating still (my copy has been all but killed by mould - darn plumbing!). But Yngwie fans really should get this on some sort of format to complete their collection. Not to mention that the almost inevitable `behind the scenes' shenanigans are mercifully absent on basically all of Yngwies video releases - here we only have to endure a minute or two...",1195171200,,2284,4.5931372549019605

7812225,5,6301540743,"I bought this video not only I like yngwie malmsteen, but also my favorite vocalist Joe Lynn Turner was in there. I had listened to the CD album (odyssey) before I watch this video tape. Joe voice is much better in the CD than in this concert, which I hope it's always been like this. Joe can sing pure rock as well as ballad. One of the song ""Dreaming"", if he sang like he did in the CD, and the camara focus more on him, it would be much better. Of course this is yngwie show so the camara shots are more on the guitarist. And let me tell you this, no other guitarist in any rock band can play like him. He is the best. Overall if you are looking for a real classic rock concert, this is the one for you.",994982400,,706,3.944055944055944
7812226,5,6301540743,"This Video is an excellent representation of one of the most innovative and virtuosic players ever to don a Strat. The sound quality is very good and the entire band shows outstanding ability and stage presence. I believe  Yngwie was about 25 or so in this Video, and plays with fire and  conviction. Highlights are: Every Song and ALL the solo bits. As a  Guitarist for 28 years, I am still amazed at this video. If you are an  aspiring player and haven't really CHECKED this guy out, BUY this and see  what exists beyond the Top 40...(Oh yeah.. Beautiful Acoustic bits..)",949708800,3,573,4.578431372549019
