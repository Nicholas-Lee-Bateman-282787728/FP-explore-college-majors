8551874,5,B00AI5NYGO,"I have books, dvd's about stretching, but most of the time you will get information about split exercises (for example). In this seminar of Pavel Tsatsouline you will get insight information what to do more than only the exercise. For example lengthen the spine (for squat and split)  in a 45 degree angel, use your strength, tense the muscles, relax the muscles etc. Depending of the level of doing the split Pavel will give different methods for this exercise. I 'am now by dvd number 2 and making an excerpt. The information you will get from Pavel for example; the key principles of stretching, to reduce knee pain during the squat, what to do to relax into the stretch, the difference between rhythm and bouncing etc. I make snapshots of the exercises and note the comment of Pavel by the snapshot. After reading my excerpt than you see the information you will get from this DVD-set. Also important is the way Pavel delegate his knowledge in an easy way! It is pity that Pavel give no seminar in Europe!",1369699200,3,1009,4.636871508379889
