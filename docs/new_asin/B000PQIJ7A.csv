The movie is well thoughtout and very funny. Even tho it was made for kids I think most adult would like it. The series can be rented on Amazom and is well worth watching. PS this movie is in PAL region 0 format I have a Panasonic DVD-S68 multi region player that I got from Amazon to watch it on.",1334880000,,471,4.075268817204301
