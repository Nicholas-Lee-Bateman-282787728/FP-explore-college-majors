5078781,5,B007CU8P8K,"Classic Zach and UCB before any of them were really that well known. I absolutely love this show, a true gem for real comedy heads.",1420675200,,131,4.28
5078782,5,B007CU8P8K,Such a hilarious show. I'm so happy it was finally released on DVD.,1416614400,,67,4.230769230769231
5078783,3,B007CU8P8K,"Not a great series and not terrible, it has its moments, and was entertaining in each episode. It gets better as the episodes go on.",1395100800,2,132,4.32
5078784,5,B007CU8P8K,Very funny and witty and absurd.  Several laugh out loud moments.  Irreverent and even topical at times.  Only complaint: too few episodes.,1391990400,2,139,5.2272727272727275
5078785,5,B007CU8P8K,"Can't say enough good things about this show. I remember watching the first episode by dumb luck when it premiered and ALL of us loved it, but NONE of us knew what to make of it. Even though I recognized Matt Walsh (nobody knew who Zach was back then), a few of my friends insisted they were a real news-team.

A lot of people must have been confused because after several episodes they added a disclaimer before the show stating that they weren't a real news-team.",1388361600,2,465,4.406976744186046
5078786,5,B007CU8P8K,This is a pretty funny series. It is really awkward humor - sort of like the office. So if you like that show you may like this one.,1360022400,2,132,3.75
5078787,5,B007CU8P8K,"This TV series gives me that genuine laugh right from the gut every time. Every episode is quotable and hilarious. One of my favorite episodes is the awkward ""Beekin and Eggs"" TV morning show pilot. Kevin Beekin is nervous and tries to dance at the beginning---like The Ellen DeGeneres Show, or something. It's incredibly awkward and I laugh just thinking about how the whole ""Beekin and Eggs"" show was a mess!

I am baffled that the show didn't continue. It is still at the top for my favorite TV shows. It is wacky, clever, off-the-cuff, and down-right hilarious! I can't wait to watch all the episodes again!! I have been searching for the show's title for a few years, hoping a DVD would pop up. I am so thankful it is now available!",1359158400,3,737,4.541353383458647
5078788,5,B007CU8P8K,"This is easily one of the Top 5 funniest shows I've ever seen.  I'm obsessed with comedy, it is my whole life, and I think it's insane and tragic that a show that is so brilliantly funny didn't last longer than one season.  I feel like a dork for quoting shows, but it's impossible not to with ""Dog Bites Man"".  ""I think what the artist intended was for it to look like you were drooling over how delicious all of that bread looked.""  Yes, Marty quotes happen more often that any others.  That's not to say the other characters aren't brilliant too, who could forget Alan's ""Can I get some cheese for my soup?"" or Beekin's ""Enough about me, what's your favorite thing that I've done?"" or Tillie's drunken ""Let's burn a church!""?  Ahh, good memories.

This show is a hidden-camera style prank show with written elements thrown in.  But you know how on Candid Camera they'll do something like have the ""prankster"" cut in line and then announce to everyone that he was just joshin', but no one gives a shit because it wasn't funny?  Dog Bites Man is actually funny and the ""pranks"" are actually clever.  When they're not, that's the point.  The cast is comprised of 4 genuinely not just funny but hilarious people.  They improvise responses based on the reaction of the person they're fooling and their responses are always funny and highly quotable. Just..just watch the show.",1349568000,3,1374,4.632231404958677
5078789,5,B007CU8P8K,"It's hard to believe how obscure this series is given that it had 9 episodes on Comedy Central and given that it stars Zach Galifianakis. And especially given how rib-hurtingly hilarious it is. This was and remains the funniest series I've seen. Period. Only _The Sarah Silverman Program_ and _Community_ have come close.

If you like awkwardness-based humor, and if you like subtle non-verbal humor (facial expressions and voice inflections and mannerisms), then I feel confident saying that Dog Bites Man will make you pee your pants.",1342569600,8,536,5.160919540229885
8514673,5,B007CU8P8K,I sort of remembered it from the original run but i ordered it on a whim and WOW! Incredible. Everyone involved is just top notch.,1520640000,,130,4.24
8514674,5,B007CU8P8K,One of my favorite shows of all time,1491436800,,36,3.625
8514675,5,B007CU8P8K,hilarious!!!!! glad I was finally able to find this show!,1482105600,,57,4.8
8514676,5,B007CU8P8K,"Took a little while longer than I expected, may have not read the delivery time right, but I was looking for this show everywhere, no bootlegs online. Had to buy it,  new in package. Good purchase",1475798400,,196,4.444444444444445
8514677,5,B007CU8P8K,Everything was great!,1456790400,,21,6.333333333333333
8514678,5,B007CU8P8K,Very funny show. Should have been on the air longer.,1439683200,,52,4.3
8514679,5,B007CU8P8K,"If this show were to have come out today, it would have had more fans. Unfortunately, I don't think many people know of its existence.",1439337600,,134,4.4
8514680,5,B007CU8P8K,"Absolutely hysterical TV show. It is much, much more sophisticated humor than Tom Green or Jackass and less 'shock value' than Borat or Bruno.",1433980800,,142,4.958333333333333
8514681,3,B007CU8P8K,"Sorry, but this one just can't hold my interest. Lacks real humor.",1426896000,,66,4.583333333333333
8514682,5,B007CU8P8K,"One of the greatest, albeit under-appreciated, comedy series ever. Terrific writing and amazing comedic talents. What more could you want in a comedy series?",1420934400,2,157,5.583333333333333
