8022217,2,B00024JBJU,"The movie may be worth more than 2 stars, but this is a generous rating for the DVD. The sound is distorted and fuzzy. All dialog is dubbed in the continental fashion of the time. It was very difficult to tell what was being said, however much of the humor was visual. Alas, the picture has been haphazardly cropped to full screen and some significant action cannot be seen, in addition to closing titles running off screen. Colors are quite drab. You never know what quality to expect from a Wham! USA disc - I have some British comedies that are near perfect in picture and sound, and others  suffer the same fate as this. All this took away from my enjoyment of the movie itself. I might have a more favorable experience with a restored widescreen transfer with cleaned up sound. Then again, the music felt much more French than British. I guess I'm just spoiled by Carry On series and the Doctor movies.",1196121600,2,907,4.496969696969697
8022218,4,B00024JBJU,"If you like the dry, British sense of humor, you will enjoy this film. There are some especially funny moments in the first 20 minutes. Mark Lester made his first film appearance in The Counterfeit Constable, and appears periodically throughout the story as part of a sort of running gag. He was 2 1/2 at the time. There are several foot chases and close calls, reminiscent of Benny Hill. This is an entertaining movie, full of broad, slapstick humor. There is very mild sexual content, no objectionable language, and no violence. The Counterfeit Constable is completely suitable for family viewing.",1194566400,,599,5.0
