It is quite good, though - keeps moving, informative, ... even though it's from 2011, it's still fairly current for 2017.  The guide is enthusiastic about Gaudi, which I like!",1504828800,,312,4.7407407407407405
8452798,3,B0051IY6T2,"This DVD on Barcelona is not really a travel guide, but more of a travel program showing the sights. There are really not the tips and hints for the most part that travel guides give. There is a mention of a reasonable place to stay and some about the transportation, but much is skipped over in the travel hint department.

There are no subtitles, which is a minus and the `extra' - Planet Food - Barcelona says the names of the places they go to so fast that if you want to know, you will have to rewind. The sound is also terrible. When Angela May is speaking to the camera, you can understand her; but then when she does background narration is sounds as if she is mumbling at a whisper in the next room.
She goes to markets and local cooks and chefs, grocery stores to show tins of food that you can take home - again at such a speed, that if you want to be sure, you have to rewind.

The main feature shows Megan McCormick bounding through Barcelona and the surrounding area. She walks, rides a bicycle, a train, a taxi and drives a car. The architecture is admired, the collection of Picasso is seen and she goes to Port Ligat and Cadaques to visit Salvador Dali's homes and see some of his work. She visits the seaside and rides a funicular.

It is a nice travel show, with the exception of the awful sound in the food part; but at times the cost of this DVD seems very high for what it is...unless you have a huge affection for Barcelona and want some video of it and the surrounding area.",1319068800,5,1498,4.230769230769231
