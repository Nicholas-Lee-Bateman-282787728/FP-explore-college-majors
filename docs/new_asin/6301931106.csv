7817272,5,6301931106,Reminded me of sitting in the T.V. room with Dad on Saturday's when i was a kid. He loved all of these segments. I too found this collection to be a treasure of memories watching t.v. with dad. As far as a factual acount of history. You couldn't ask for a more indepth coverage of the years of WWII. It is a must have.,1110067200,,318,3.984375
7817273,2,6301931106,A New Germany- The first volume of the World At War could have been better both with information and trying to keep me from being distracted. It gave hardly information on Germany after World War I and it forgot serval very important facts on Germany's territory expansion such as it did not accuire all of Czechoslavkia and it forgot that Germany took Memel. But the World At War gets better and I think that anyone that is becoming a history professor should not miss this!,1036800000,,475,4.6
