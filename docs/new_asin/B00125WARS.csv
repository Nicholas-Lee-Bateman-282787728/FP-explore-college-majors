8244006,5,B00125WARS,"My wife and I bought the ""Growing Up..."" series on DVD for our kids.  But we love it just as much, if not more, than they do.",1360886400,,125,3.6296296296296298
8244007,5,B00125WARS,"This documentary makes me want to grow up all over again. It is so inspiring to see all of these other wildcats persevere through tough times and grow up healthy and happy. I couldn't believe Sarge's bravery during his field trip to the lake! I remember the first time I went to the lake like it was yesterday. There were some emotional stories in here (poor Eddy!), but for the most part it was so fun to see all these young wildcats running around and learning how to live. I think I could teach a thing or two to these guys about hunting though, if anyone knows how to get in contact with them.",1348012800,,597,4.245614035087719
8244008,2,B00125WARS,I was hoping for a nice video on wildcats.  Instead it's got images totally depressing and inappropriate for kids in my opinion.  I don't want to watch the horrors people do wild animals.  And it shows too many people as well.  Growing up Wild Cat's title is misleading.,1346544000,,270,4.5625
8244009,4,B00125WARS,"I must say, this was one of the cutest DVD's I seen in a long time, and it was also very informative.  I loved it and recommend it for adults as well as children.",1259971200,,162,3.764705882352941
8244010,5,B00125WARS,"If you're a fan of wild cats then this is the dvd for you. The disc contains four programs from the Animal Planet's Growing Up Series. The cats featured are lions, tigers, cheetahs and the not seen often black leopard. It's informative, entertaining, and appropriate for everyone. You'll cheer each animal on as it's journey progresses. I've seen it twice already. This one is a keeper.",1252713600,3,386,4.863636363636363
8244011,3,B00125WARS,I bough these for a person with Alzheimer's - it was ok but the talking was too much and hard for them to follow. It really is a kids video!!,1243209600,2,141,3.7333333333333334
8244012,5,B00125WARS,"My 7 yr old LOVES animals and this DVD was a great choice!  We had rented it from our local library and watched it so many times I knew it would be worth the purchase.  It contains 4 stories about baby tigers, lions, leopards and cheetahs raised in captivity.  My son watches it over and over and is learning about compassion for animals and the importance of respecting animal habitats.  It's a GREAT alternative to cartoons when he needs to entertain himself and wants to watch a movie.",1241395200,,488,4.511363636363637
8244013,5,B00125WARS,"YES. Everyone should see this video, for sheer pleasure and for education. Thank God for the good people of deep compassion who show us what love in action is. When I first watched this, I couldn't get myself away. If there's a day you're feeling a bit unwell, this will give you comfort food for the heart.",1222560000,4,307,4.4035087719298245
8244014,5,B00125WARS,"Animal Planet's ""Growing Up"" is not only inspiring, but wonderfully educational for everyone who views these great videos.  There are 4 episodes including lions, tigers, a black leopard, and Cheetahs!  All four videos are wonderful!

There is another Growing Up video which contains 4 videos on Arctic animals.  All animal lovers will find themselves falling in love with these special creatures!",1209340800,7,396,5.442622950819672
