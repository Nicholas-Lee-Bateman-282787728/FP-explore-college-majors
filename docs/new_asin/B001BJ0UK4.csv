8483736,5,B001BJ0UK4,"this really doesn't talk about any particular notable wrestling things but OMG, these guys are hilarious! and there are some wrestlers you'll recognize-if you know these 2 that is1- that make some really side splitting appearances as well! all in all, if you're a real fan, a fan of more than just the tv show, this is something you'll love!!!!",1232323200,,344,4.75
8483737,3,B001BJ0UK4,"In the tradition of comedic duos like Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and Coulter and Limbaugh comes.....Levy and Fullington?  Not so fast, gentle ""mark"", there are a few things you should know about this DVD.  First of all, Raven and Sandman are profoundly bored and not at all cooperative with the whole concept, preferring to crack each other up with ancient one-liners and jokes at the expense of our host, Keith Lipinski.  A surprise appearance by Terry Funk livens up the festivities with a bit of barnyard sodomy humor, then ""The Funker"" takes his leave and the last three quarters of the interview are dominated by New Jack.  Hear the ""Original Gangster's"" thoughts on Magic Johnson, the coming Obama administration (almost verbatim to what my grandfather said the day after Election Day), and a few recreational pharmacutical anecdotes from the ECW locker room.  Extras include:

New Jack's speech at Terry Funk's 23rd retirement party- A planned three minute tribute goes to roughly a RAMBLING 30 minutes.  ""Terry Funk, I can't apologize no more!!""  Fashions from the Rudy Ray Moore collection.

A bunch of matches from the XPW archives, with commentary from ""Generic Announcerman"" and a guy who sounds like ""Ham Hands"" Bill.  Watch the legends of hardcore do the J-O-B for a bunch of nondescript XPW scrubs...

While this could have definitely been better, and Sandman would probably be more at home filling Alan Colmes' chair at Fox News*, if you like your legends of hardcore drunk to the gills and cussing like maniacs, look no further.  This DVD is about as close as you can get to playing bar trivia with New Jack without multiple stabwounds.

*He could actually hold his own in that environment and be FAR more entertaining than JBL.  Plus, there's no way around it, Hannity NEEDS a beating.",1232064000,4,1815,4.927631578947368
