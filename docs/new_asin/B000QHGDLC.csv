8196487,5,B000QHGDLC,"I Want What I Want, supposedly authored by Geoff Brown, has been a mystery that has spawned great interest in a small intellectual section of the transgender community. The community in general strongly rejects the notions of hopelessness set forth in the book. The community wants to place blame on society for the dysphoria associated with their condition. The community does not want to admit that the condition includes a psychological abnormality of a potentially self-destructive nature. Thus, the community rejects out of hand the underlying premise of the book.

I do not.

On first reading I immediately recognized an incredibly accurate insight to the condition. (By condition I mean gender identity dysforia, GID) This book could not possible have been written by Brown, an uneducated English bloke..  Several people have tried to track down the named author.  He was found several years ago but refused any interview.  He reportedly has also earlier refused to cooperate with the production of the movie which is the subject of DVD being offered here by Amazon. He was found to have lived in the same house that he was born in, lived in more that 30 years with his wife, and apparently died in several years ago having supposedly written just one additional unsuccessful book.

Bolder-dash.

He could no more be the author of that book then I could fly to the moon with waxed wings in a mini skirt.

I have now studied the book in more detail and realized that the term ""psychotic hermaphrodite"" was the key to finding the true author. That term was employed by a Dr. John Money of John's Hopkins University Hospital in association with transexuality.  Money was initially a well respected pioneer in the transgender field. I was a patient of his many many years ago for about 27 minutes, which was the length of time it took me to realize he was, in my opinion, a pompous fraud. Shortly after that he was exposed to the world as in fact being a fraud. His most significant ""research"" was exposed to be based on falsified research that adversely affected many children and adults with GID. He eventually left the profession in disgraced and is now dead.

But here is the key. He had an assistant in the early 60's, Dr. Richard Green, who had access to hundreds of case histories.  He and Dr. Money  published the results of these cases in 1969. ( the link is below). I Want Want I Want was published in 1967 and written several years before that. NO ONE BUT GREEN AND MONEY WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE KIND OF INSIGHTS REFLECTED IN THE BOOK, NO ONE IN THE WORLD.

Money would never have the creativity or interest to write the book-Green did (see link below).

Green could not have published when he did without offending Money and perhaps violating confidences. So, he appears to have used Geoff Brown as a front for the book.  As you can see from the link below Dr. Green had connections with England throughout his life, so while his exact relation to Brown is ambitious it is reasonable to assume he knew Brown in some capacity.

The revelation that Green and not Brown authored the book is significant on several levels. First, it explains the inconceivable authorship of Brown, and provides justification for Brown's refusal to afford any interview or insight to the book.

Second and more significant it provides insight to the reality that this condition is in fact self-destructive in a manner that is not wholly dependent on society's reactions.  We who suffer this condition need to accept the need for psychological intervention with or perhaps more often without hormonal and surgical intervention.  Today the psychological intervention aspect is almost entirely discredited. In my humble opinion this is a huge and dangerous mistake. The main character in I Want What I Want (representing the amalgamation of perhaps hundreds of real life case studies) was internally tormented and not just conflicted by interaction with an unaccepting society. Read carefully that inner turmoil was the primary catalyst to the suicidal tendencies that are, again in my humble but not substantiated opinion, typical of the condition.

Transitioning may very well alter the nature of the internal conflicts, but I strongly suspect these conflicts will reappear more often that not, if the underlying psychological issues of the condition are not adequately addressed.

So, while the general public may read I Want Want I Want as a poorly written but cute little novel, those with GID should read it with fear and foreboding.

8196488,4,B000QHGDLC,"I saw this movie in a theatre a number of decades ago.  At that time, I thought it was fantastic (for the era).  Im not sure it would hold its own in the 21st Century, considering there are more recent films made of this nature.  I enjoyed it, but I cant say one way or the other for a recommendation.  However, I can recommend A Soldiers Girl, TransAmerica, and few others you may want to search for on Amazon.  Good luck.",1390694400,,423,4.172839506172839

8196490,3,B000QHGDLC,If you like older dvds attempting to tackle the current socially relevant issues--this is for you. The acting is wooden and the dialogue laughable. As a period piece it does give us a window into the thinking and attitudes present during this period--1972. I read this novel more than 40 (?) years ago and thought it was well done--today I wouldn't give it a second look. If you want a laugh....go for it.,1377302400,,405,4.561643835616438
8196491,5,B000QHGDLC,"this is a must watch movie
I was really young when I first saw this movie on HBO.
I was glad to finally buy the tape
it is really powerful I can relate to it even though I am happy with who i am.
if you have ever felt like you don't fit in in life give this movie a watching.
keep the tissues handy.
I love the way it ends but the scene before the ending is painful to watch.",1206230400,13,375,3.6419753086419755
