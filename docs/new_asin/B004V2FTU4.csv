8442563,3,B004V2FTU4,"first noticed the shave-less bloke so vouched by the youngsters in the eighties in this film and from here i have been a Anil Kapoor fan. A very smooth and rollicking comedy-thriller with a good plausible story. Jackie schroff is superbly teamed with Kapoor and the chemistry works wonders. Probably a take-off of a Hollywood movie as the main theme is foreign. Especially Kapoor's lust for the opposite sex! The direction,outdoor shooting and script are good. Music is average for 1984. Subsequent pairing of Schroff and Kapoor reaped well and it is sad we have not seen the two again now in their middle age. An enjoyable and amusing film for the escapist.",1304985600,,658,4.831858407079646
