Like others have said,this is way too fast for a hike, they are all like this.  They're also to broken up.  In a 35 minute workout, I don't want to go to five different destinations.  And for this price, how about 5 different hikes each to a single destination.  These could have been great, but thrown together too quickly.  The scenery on the British Columbia hike (and run) disks is incredible, but presented poorly.  Way too fast.  And why not an out and back run?  They have to hike out too don't they?  The perspective on the return trip would be just as interesting to see.",1519516800,,754,4.35251798561151

8455767,5,B0053UBJ20,"Beautiful scenery all the way, and also loved the music.  I use these DVDs with a mini elliptical and it is at a great pace for it.  Highly recommended!",1407715200,,152,4.206896551724138
8455768,5,B0053UBJ20,"I have been using this DVD over the last month to just view while jogging in place, (since I don't own a treadmill--and won't because I would rather spend my money on traveling to hiking areas and actually hiking than trying to get my money's worth on an expensive exercise machine). It's refreshing to experience wonderful scenery while exercising--which often I do when I don't dare exercise outside due bad air pollution days, especially during the winter.",1390262400,,459,4.974025974025974
8455769,5,B0053UBJ20,Nice scenery - pleasant DVD for walking.  I had back surgery in January of this year and the doctor told me that walking is the best therapy.  Having this DVD helped keep the boredom at bay while on a treadmill and elliptical.,1368489600,,226,4.357142857142857
8455770,2,B0053UBJ20,"I thought this would be wonderful since I had previously bought a hike DVD on an Oahu trail and loved it.  This one of Lake Tahoe, although the scenery started out beautiful, just turned me off with how fast (more like a dead run) it went for a hike.  And I really don't want someone putting music to a nature hike.  The music grated on every nerve I had.  So I just couldn't get more than 4 minutes into it.  It is the nature sounds that I find so soothing in all my other Virtual DVD's.  So although this might work for some, it didn't work for me.

8455771,5,B0053UBJ20,"I used to ride and hike the Flume Trail in Tahoe when I lived there a while ago.  The quality of the Virtual Active DVD's is outstanding.  You feel like you can touch the scenery.  Depending on your monitor size, this footage is the next best thing to being there.  I like to not use the spoken guidance, however if you are lacking motivation the guidance is very helpful.  I sometimes use my ipod for music so I can vary the soundtrack.  Enjoy!",1308960000,2,445,4.301204819277109
