Now I just need to get a player that I can watch it on! :P From what I remember from seeing it on BBC America, it's hilarious.",1418860800,,250,3.9215686274509802
8713876,5,B000EZ7VFS,"UK car based entertainment show Top Gear has here compiled a feast of vehicular hijinks of a wintery nature. The whole show is based in Norway and includes highlights such as;

Playing ice hockey with cars.

Taking on a champion speed skater with a jaguar.

Firing a mini off the end of a ski jump by putting a rocket in it (no that's not a misprint).

Winter vehicular based biathlon. With automatic weapons instead of single shot rifles.

All of this is of course wrapped in the usual joking Top Gear vernacular. There are plenty of jibes between the presenters, some lovely cars and some beautiful winter white scenery and really as a release it is the full package and a very worthy gift for any Top Gear fan you know. Or you could, you know, just buy it for yourself...",1398297600,,774,4.460992907801418
