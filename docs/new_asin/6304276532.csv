829050,5,6304276532,"Journey into the Mists captivated both my children (3 and 5 years old), my wife and me.  It is a story of courage, acceptance of others (hence the song ""It takes all kinds""), and family ties.  This movie is based upon the original Land Before Time video and is yet another sequel in this very popular series.
In this story, Little Foot meets another small long neck named Allie.  Allie is afraid of other dinosaurs because she has only been among other long necks.  As part of a band of migrating long necks, she and her family come into the Great Valley while fleeing their former home, which has become a misty swamp that they now derisively call ""The Land of Mists.""  After their arrival, Grandpa Longneck faill mysteriously ill and the migratory long necks identify his malady and proscribe a cure - a plant that only grows in the Land of Mists.  Little Foot wants to go to find the mysterious plant, and he needs Allie's help.  Allie refuses, however, to go unless Little Foot's friends do not come along.
Herein lies the most positive part of this tale - Allie must get over her fear of other dinosaurs if she is to be of help to Little Foot and the others.  She has to learn that accept and work with those who are different from herself.
The story resolves, and the children learn valuable lessons.  This story also includes a couple of very funny villians who are constantly telling each how worthless they are.  These two cracked us up, but their constant bantering and bickering might be a little over the top for very small children.  My two laughed and laughed for hours on end.  We found that it was important to explain that this behavior is inappropriate and this is why it is funny.  This was easily done, since the story shows that these two end up working against each other most of the time and not with each other.
I highly recommend this video.  There are some tender moments in this video and some great songs.  I would however caution parents with very small children, since there are two villians who are not very nice to anyone.  My three and five year old really liked it, but for children younger than that, I would exercise caution.",988243200,17,2161,4.5025641025641026

Now that she's older and VHS is old and outdated, I was ready to send it out for donation, but my daughter loved the series and wanted to keep the tapes.  We decided to purchase the dvd versions to replace the vhs versions of all the old ""Land Before Time"" stories she loved while growing up.

Any family that has 4 year to 8 year old children would like these movies.  They are entertaining,not preachy, and the morel of the segment is arrived at through experience.  Is easily understood by children.  Best of all they teachgood behavior with  entertainment, not with Do Not's, which is easier to understand.",1353888000,,486,4.635294117647059
829762,1,6304276532,This series of videos is scary for young children.  Do not let the G rating fool you.  I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes.  Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos.  Not something I want my child learning.  Very poorly done story lines.  Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!,1337299200,,379,4.3428571428571425

829765,5,6304276532,"This is one of my absolute favorite LBT movies and it's a wonderful family friendly film. I was extremely happy to finally be able to watch it again on DVD after not seeing it for over 10 years. I have to say, I'm sorry I got rid of my VHS copy. In fact, you'd probably get better video quality if you got this movie brand new on VHS. I ended up trying out two copies of this DVD. The first time, I noticed this very distracting colored line on the left side of the screen and every so often, you'd see black circles on the two bottom corners of the video. So I thought, well maybe it was just one copy that was bad. Oh no. It doesn't stop there. The second copy I got had the same issues as the first one and at one point, I saw that Little Foot turns blue! Freakin' Blue! D: I'm not kidding. Now, I'm not sure if that happened on VHS or not but I'm pretty sure I remember that never happened on the VHS copy. After I saw that, I literally just lost it and I shipped both of the DVD's back. Such a waste of my time and shame on you Universal! I know you can do better DVD transfers than this.

I took screen shots of the issues I was having so you can see what I'm talking about. I will be posting these on amazon asap.

Overall:
1 star for the product 5 stars for the movie. Very disappointing. For now, I recommend sticking with your VHS copy.

If anybody else is having these issues please let me know.",1317859200,,1406,3.99644128113879

I'm 15 now, will be 16 in 2 months, and I've been watching Land Before Time for as long as I can remember. They're a huge part of my heart and forever will be.

So, he's learned a lot about dinosaurs from them.  And the movies are wholesome and promote friendship and good behavior.
THIS EPISODE WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE OF THE MEAN-SPIRITED BANTERING OF THE TWO VILLAINS.  The prehistoric crocodile and pterasaur (dinosaur bird) are constantly telling each other how much they ""hate"" each other.  There is a song they sing back and forth about how ""I need you like a hold in the head"" and that type of thing.  And their voices are terribly annoying.
I was immediately uncomfortable, but then I heard my son starting to say this stuff to his sister...
