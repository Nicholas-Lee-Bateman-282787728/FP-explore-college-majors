3617020,5,B001GP5TMW,"I was a big fan of the show, and had been waiting for the series to come out on DVD. As soon as I saw that Amazon was taking pre-oreders, I did just that. As I waited for the DVD set to arrive, I was worried that perhaps, like some other shows from my childhood, I would be left wondering why I had even liked the show. Thankfully, my fears were for nothing, as my brother and I were watching the show laughing just like we did back when the show was new. I think my only major complaint about the DVD set was that not all the episodes had commentaries, just one or two on each disc. Hopefully the next ones will contain more. I'll definitely be buying the rest of the seasons, whenever it is that they come out.",1235260800,,712,4.056737588652482
3617021,5,B001GP5TMW,"Finally, this fantastic television series has made it's way onto DVD.
Television used to be really great and there were a few family friendly sitcoms.
This show featured a great cast, awesome theme song, family values and it offered us many, many laughs!
So, join Blossom, Six, Joey and the rest of the gang for some good old fashioned family hilarity!
Featuring the ever gorgeous Jenna Von Oy as Six!!
Highly Recommended Television Series and DVD set!

It's great to see that Shout Factory is releasing many great television shows on DVD:(My Two Dads, Room 222, Mr. Belvedere, Simon & Simon, etc.)",1233964800,,598,4.862745098039215
3617022,5,B001GP5TMW,"I'm a big geek for TV trivia and I had no idea the original Blossom pilot was so different! In one of the commentaries they reveal the original theme music for the show was ""My Prerogative"" by Bobby Brown; listen to the closing credits of the pilot and you'll hear part of the song, at least, though it was replaced on the actual pilot opening. Blossom had two parents and Joey was ""Donnie!"" Whoa!

Shout! Factory, as usual, did a great job here.",1233878400,,446,4.373493975903615
3617023,4,B001GP5TMW,"Maybe it's just that ultra-catchy theme song or the refreshingly real title character, but in any case, I was thrilled to learn that these DVD's were arriving in January 2009. It's been long overdue, especially since it hasn't even been shown on TV since I was a kid, so the timing is great to finally have it immortalized through the DVD's!

For those who grew up with the show and remember it as a blast from their 1990's past, this has been a great way to kick off the new year! I was very happy to purchase this over the weekend (at a very good price, too), and it brings back fond memories of those good old '90's classics that will never again be matched by anything. Of course, considering all the reality TV and other ""the way teens really are"" junk that airs these days, it doesn't seem like most screenwriters are challenging themselves to meet the original standard that was set by television shows from decades past.

Just in case you aren't familiar with show's basic premise, Blossom Russo was a young teenager in a house full of men after her mother Madolyn (interesting spelling, huh?) took off, leaving her entire family behind, to pursue a singing career in Paris. Four years have already passed since this stressful family event occurred, meaning that the writers were able to bypass the deserted husband and youngsters' initial shock and anger, but there was still plenty to explore with how the four of them were coping a few years down the road. It was no easy task for Nick Russo to finish raising three kids on his own, especially since he was dealing with one son who was a recovering drug addict, another underachieving teenage son who acted more like a kid than most kindergarteners, and an impressionable young daughter who was right in the wings of adolescence (one of the scariest things in the world for most dads, especially when boys start coming into the picture).

The series started out fairly low-key, focusing mainly on Blossom and featuring her father and brothers as supporting characters in her life. It was indicated that Madolyn still had telephone and postcard contact with her children, although this was not at all central to the rest of the story, at least not at this point in the series, and the attention was placed largely on Nick and the kids, not their mother/ex-wife's whereabouts. Also, once the second season started, the writing became somewhat more quirky, complete with various dream/fantasy sequences (watch for the infamous ""Rockumentary"" episode, filmed almost entirely in black and white, which established a more exaggerated form of the unorthodox style that the show gradually took on). The script also began juggling more subplots and characters at a time, including the kids' maternal grandfather Buzz, whose thick sarcasm makes it easy likening him to Frank Barone on ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" Exploring the relationship between a divorced man and his ex-wife's father is something that most family sitcom writers wouldn't even bother to attempt, let alone develop over more than just a few episodes. In typical ""Blossom"" fashion, though, the challenging and the controversial were unveiled, and the audience got a refreshingly honest look at how Nick had to set aside his own bitter resentments in order to let his children have their grandfather in their lives.

Things were tough for the Russos after Madolyn split, but their home life wasn't exactly worthy of complaint, either. The household was run by a strong and loving father, and the older brothers were two decent, caring guys who would do anything for their younger sister. Blossom was forced to enter those rough teen years without a mom to talk to or ask questions, but again, her dad and siblings were always there when it really mattered. The first two seasons watched them slowly adjust to their new situation and begin feeling like a family again. That much about the series is pretty clear, but now that it has come to DVD about 13 years since the final episode aired, the intended audience is a little trickier to identify. Also, as I've already mentioned, the show has not aired in reruns on TV for years, so adults who don't remember much about it may be tempted to think that it's appropriate for their children to watch, much like ""Full House"" and ""Punky Brewster,"" both of which have attracted whole new audiences through their DVD releases. One thing is for sure, though: ""Blossom"" is much edgier TV entertainment, experimenting with some controversial storylines that include drugs, alcohol, sex, messy divorces, recovering addicts who fall off the wagon,  and all those things that you wouldn't necessarily expect from a family-oriented show of its time. I was pretty shocked at some of the sexual innuendos, including a scene where the Russo kids wondered if Nick's attractive new girlfriend would eventually become their stepmother, and Joey showed no shame in saying, ""You think we could get her to spank us?"" Needless to say, you probably wouldn't want to plop your elementary-aged child in front of the screen with dialogue like that in one episode after another (and trust me, some plot material and visual images got pretty racy).

It's actually fascinating that the show got away with some of the things that it did, but then again, the face of family sitcoms was changing rapidly at the time, and writers began deciding that completely squeaky-clean scripts should be ""humanized"" with funnier, slightly more permiscuous material. ""Blossom"" was one of the first family series to do this, and now that more risque shows like ""Two and a Half Men"" are so widely successful, it's interesting to note how the sitcom world started turning in the early 1990's. Getting back to my original point, though...in my opinion, I'd have to say that these DVD's are primarily geared toward the original fans, and while there are other younger generations who may enjoy it (it's ultimately up to the parents to decide if they think their children can handle it), you almost have to have experienced it previously in order to really appreciate it.

Again, in terms of the more mature plot threads, oldest brother Anthony was a former alcohol and substance abuser, which represented one of the most heartbreaking stories in the series. He had been clean for over a year when the show started and was  finally beginning to thrive again (despite being somewhat reluctant to admit that he was actually ready to take the next step in life), but those former skeletons returned to haunt him when it came to rekindling old friendships and looking for work. The writers obviously trusted the audience to understand and respect some more grown-up, ""real-world"" material in these storylines, and Anthony's issues represented what several shows were too scared to expose. Blossom was portrayed as the show's moral compass, but even she slipped on more than one occasion, including an episode where she and her best pal Six considered drinking in their hotel room during a school trip, and another episode where they brought home some marijuana that they found on the bus. Russo patriarch Nick was a generally good man who worked hard to take care of his family and cope as a single father, but he was constantly forced to make difficult decisions, many of which were undermined by his children (and sometimes even the audience) over a succession of episodes.

Of course, there is plenty to love and respect about the series as a whole, and while the writers did touch on more serious social topics, most of the situations were idealized to accommodate the show's generally ""family friendly"" label. Despite the abandonment of her mother during her formative years, Blossom was remarkably well-adjusted, with acts of rebellion that were only occasional and short lived, then quickly forgiven and forgotten. Her relationship with her father was also one of those quieter, yet magical assets to the show, and come to think of it, it's one of the only things I remember vividly from the show's original run. Even when I was younger, I was able to sense that special bond that existed between them and was completely separate from the relationship that Nick had with his sons. Seeing as Blossom was his only daughter, she represented the little girl that he adored and desperately wanted to protect. Terms such as ""practically a saint"" and ""a gift from God"" were the descriptions that Nick had on hand for his daughter during these early seasons, while Blossom referred to him as ""inspiring"" and ""one of the cool guys that everybody admires"". Sure, it's little cheesy, but it also happened to be the heart of the show in many ways, so I'm willing to take it.

The cast is solid, with each individual actor meshing well with the rest of the group. Leading lady Blossom was scripted to be somewhere in-between the Queen Bees and the nerds, and Mayim Bialik was perfect in projecting that image. Maybe she was slightly more on the dorky side, but she was always comfortable with herself, and she earned a lot of points for setting that example. Her style was quirky yet lovable (the opening credits let you know, right off the bat, that the next thirty minutes are going to be a lighthearted retreat), and her overall character managed to be admirable without being too overdrawn or sappy. Joey Lawrence pulled off the ""teen hunk"" status for younger female viewers without having to even exert much effort (most of his one-liners make me crack up no matter how often I watch it), and Michael Stoyanov succeeded with his much different, yet equally likable character. Anyone who has ever had to accept and conquer the mistakes of their past will easy identify with his story. Ted Wass was also well cast in what ended up being his final acting gig before he switched to directing, and while maintaining a fine balance between hip and responsible, he was as much of a respectable TV dad as anyone else out there. Then, in the tradition of actresses like Andrea Barber on ""Full House"" and Emily Osment on the more recent ""Hannah Montana,"" Jenna von Oy tackled the ""best friend"" role with grace, while clearly demonstrating enough talent to have her own show. I love her performance in these early seasons, and with some of her scenes--specifically though with her and Bialik acting like goofy, giggly teenage girls--I often wonder how they managed to keep a straight face during the filming process.

A slew of recognizable guest stars were present in Seasons 1 and 2, including Eileen Brennan, Tori Spelling, Tiffani Amber-Thiessen, ""Golden Girls"" icon Estelle Getty in a crossover role, and perhaps most notably, Phylicia Rashad--also known as Clair Huxtable--one of the most acclaimed and beloved TV moms ever. She appeared briefly in the first episode (not the original pilot, but the first episode with all the established actors and characters), in a controversial scene that almost had the network threatening to not air the episode unless it was edited out (more information on that is provided in the audio commentary for ""Blossom Blossoms""). So you know that the guest stars are going to be good, and if you are an avid fan of the classic sitcom ""The Golden Girls,"" you will notice at least a handful of actors who appeared on that series at some point or another (both shows had the same executive producers).

As for the actual packaging and other such details...I have to say that Shout Factory did a nice job bringing these episodes to DVD. You can count on Shout to resurrect some of the best old school TV shows and transfer them to DVD with care. The episodes look great, considering they were filmed almost 20 years ago. The outer packaging holds three thinner jewel cases on the inside, just like they did with shows like ""Full House"" and ""Beverly Hills, 90210."" Each one carries two discs, and the cases list the episodes on the outside. There is also a little insert that provides a brief synopsis for each episode. As far as I know, all the episodes are featured as they were originally broadcast, without any edits, but then again, it's been a heck of a long time since I saw this on TV, so it would probably be better to ask someone who watched it from the very, very beginning. Although some of the scene transitions appear choppy, I think that was just a sign of a 1990's series that was early in its run and using the same fade-in and fade-out techniques over and over.

The special features are also outstanding, especially in light of the fact that many shows (specifically those that aired a long time ago) don't include any at all. First up is the original pilot episode--which is listed as a bonus feature instead of with the regular episode lineup--which you will understand as soon as you see it. The pilot is so different from the rest of the series (the father is played by a different actor, the two older brothers have awkward new names, and Blossom's parents' marriage is rocky, yet intact). It does little else than provide some groundwork for how the writers wanted to convey the title character through a video camera diary and personal narrations. It also provides a glimpse at what the series might have been like if, instead of depicting the pitfalls of divorce and maternal abandonment, they had explored the more strenuous side of marriage that most sitcoms didn't express until ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and ""King of Queens"" came along. All in all, the pilot didn't do much for me, and I was too bored to even watch the whole thing, but in order to release a ""complete"" season set, including it in this collection was paramount.

Audio commentaries were also recorded for three episodes, and the co-stars that participated are Mayim Bialik, Jenna von Oy, and Joey Lawrence. Series creator Don Reo is present for all three commentaries, as well. At least 80% of all three commentaries found the participants laughing hysterically at the general silliness of the dialogue they were given 20 years ago, but they also offer some nice insights on their experiences filming the show.

Also included are three featurettes, where several more cast members discuss the show, its content, the wardrobe, why Ted Wass almost turned down the role of Nick Russo, and why the casting crew originally didn't think that Joey Lawrence would be good enough as the teen heartthrob. (Imagine that!) One of the nicest bonuses, however, is the one where Mayim Bialik and Jenna von Oy sit down together to discuss their on-screen friendship and address the age-old question that they are still asked constantly: ""Were you as close in real life as you were on the show?"" This featurette seems particularly honest and refreshing to watch, since neither actress bothers to act fake or pretend that they were, like, the bestest friends in the entire world when the cameras stopped rolling. The girls acknowledge that yes, they spent time together during filming and engaged in some of the same activities, such as dancing classes, but they also respected each other's physical space, and while their TV characters were virtually inseparable, they didn't feel the need to sit there and act like they were the exact same way in real life.

Despite the absence of subtitles on the DVD (it may take several written complaints from consumers before Shout Factory addresses that with their products), this one is definitely worth buying if you're a fan. It may not be entirely appropriate to share with younger kids, and today's teens--who grow up idolizing more angsty shows like ""Gossip Girl"" and ""Secret Life of the American Teenager""--may find it a bit outdated. Again, though, it's a perfect gift for those who grew up watching it, and in essence, they are the ones that the manufacturers had in mind with this DVD set.

For me, the best thing about having this collection is that I only recall bits and pieces of some episodes, and there are others that I don't remember at all, so revisiting them through the DVD's has been a truly enjoyable experience. I have plowed through the first three discs in three days, and I look forward to finishing the rest. This means that Shout Factory just has seasons 3-5 left to bring to DVD, and I am sure that sales will be good enough to have them out as soon as possible. Given the nostalgic charm and quality of these first two seasons, I am not at all worried about future releases, and in fact, I'm confident that sales will ""surely shine""! So ""stop all your fussin', slap on a smile,"" and enjoy Seasons 1 and 2! Waiting for Seasons 3-5 is going to be tough, but I guess I'll find a way to manage!",1233619200,25,16574,4.824129440731621
3617024,5,B001GP5TMW,I am soooooooo happy that this is finally out on DVD!!  I am about to order it and can't wait to get it and watch it over and over again!  I love this show and I am the happiest girl in the world now that it has been released on DVD!!!,1233014400,,235,3.588235294117647
3617025,5,B001GP5TMW,"Blossom: Seasons 1 & 2 has just been released on DVD and I'm very much a happy girl! I loved this show, this was a childhood favorite of mine. Mayim Bialik (who I loved in Beaches) is perfectly cast as Blossom, a young girl who chronicles her life with a video camera. Blossom is very smart for her age, her character has depth which is important, so many girls on t.v. now are obsessed with artifical things. Joey Lawrence became a huge star thanks to his good looks and biceps, WHOA! I highly recommend this groundbreaking series, buy it today!!",1233014400,,547,4.48
3617026,4,B001GP5TMW,"Everytime I think of 'Blossom', I remember myself watching it, at the age of 8 or 9, while eating lunch, getting ready to go to school (I used to see it on its morning reruns) and having great fun. It was probably one of the very first TV series I actually cared about.

I grew up watching this show and it's been a long , long time since I saw it for the last time. I can't even remember the show precisely! I do remember some moments, some situations and of course, those delightful characters that always made me laugh so hard. So, I guess it'll be simply great to revisit the series after so long; I bet it'll be like having a whole new experience.

Well, it's been virtually a decade that I've waited for these DVD's, so I'm really looking forward to this pack with Season 1-2. I'm glad there are extras in the pack, such as commentaries from the director and cast, and interviews with Mayim, Joey and the others!!

Thank you 'Shout!' for bringing these DVDs, and I truly hope it doesn't take long for the other seasons to come!! I'm sure this will be a sucess on DVD.

EDIT (February 22, 2009):

So here I am, finally through with the complete seasons 1 and 2. And I couldn't be happier! As a matter of fact, there was little I actually remembered about 'Blossom' - moments, a few lines, few storylines. I just knew I had loved it. But I was very surprised to realize that I still think, over 10 years later, that this is a good, well-written, funny show.

The actors did a wonderful job and the plots were interesting. The teenagers were never underestimated, very believable. I realize I appreciate the show now on a whole new level, taking into account aspects I sure didn't years before.

And the special features are great! We get to see all the actors nowadays reflecting back on their experiences on the show. There are a couple of featurettes on their friendship, the style of the show etc. and also commentaries on the episodes; not to mention the original pilot, quite different from the show itself. Very nice.

Overall, it was worth the wait. Bring on Season 3!!

EDIT (May 5, 2010)

And here I am again, over a year later, to complain about the fact that there's still no news of Season 3 being released anytime soon! That's just mean!

The ""Multi-Generational"" thing made it interesting for me, at 51, to watch. Without it? No interest to me, really. There's NO getting around the fact that this must have been a great ""real life lesson"" show for the teens Blossom's age, that I imagine were the target audience. As Lou Costello said, ""If you get the kids, you will get their parents."" And in the end, Blossom did GET me!",1374192000,,639,4.47008547008547

3617116,5,B001GP5TMW,"I never saw Blossom during its original run. I only started watching it when it went into syndication and aired in the late afternoons. Shout! Factory released the first two seasons on a six discs set back in 2009, in which I was thrilled to be able to see the quirky comedy again.

The original pilot aired in July of 1990 on NBC as a special and served as a backdoor pilot. Thanks to impressive ratings, the series was picked up, aired its first season in January 1991, and ran for five seasons, ending on May 22, 1995.

Mayim Bialik (The Big Bang Theory) played the teenager Blossom Russo who wore crazy clothes and wild hats, as well as her best friend Six (played by Jenna von Oy), who talks nonstop. Her singer mother abandoned her and her two older brothers, the ex-drug addict Anthony (played by Michael Stoyanov) and the simple minded Joey (played go Joey Lawrence). Their struggling musician father, Nick (played by Ted Wass), raises them all.

The series dealt with typical teenager issues, normally adding a bit a humor to go along it. During each episode, Blossom would tape a video diary, aka a pre-blogger.

The episodes in this set are:

Disc One - Blossom Blossoms, My Sister's Keeper, Dad's Girlfriend, Who's In Charge Here?, Sex Lies and Teenagers, I Ain't Got No Buddy

Bonus Features: The Blossom ""Pilot""

Disc Two - Thanks For The Memorex, The Geek, Tough Love, Such A Night, School Daze, Papa's Little Dividend, Love Stinks

Disc Three - Second Base, Here Comes the Buzz?, The Joint, I'm With The Band, Honor?, To Tell The Truth, Intervention

Disc Four - Run For The Border, Blossom - A Rockumentary, Expectations, You Can't Go Home, This Old House, It's A Marginal Life, The Test

Disc Five - Hot For Teacher, Three O'Clock and All Is Hell, Losers Win, The Letter, Wake Up Little Susie, You Must Remember This, House Guests

Disc Six - Whines and Misdemeanors, Driver's Education, Spring Fever

Bonus Features: A Very Special Show, A Very Special Style, and A Very Special Friendship.

Even after all these years, Blossom is still a likeable sitcom. I always enjoyed the episodes with the grandpa Buzz (played by the late Barnard Hughes). I am still hoping that Shout! Factory will bring out the other three seasons in the near future.",1343174400,10,2260,4.691139240506329

3617127,5,B001GP5TMW,"I bought this DVD set for my daughter for Christmas to show her the shows I used to watch. They were shipped quickly, and packaged well.  Anyone who was a BLossom fan will appreciate this great DVD set!",1294876800,,202,4.315789473684211
3617128,4,B001GP5TMW,"Rejecting the traditional scripting formula for shows targeted towards teen girls, Blossom did something definitely 'alternative' for it's viewing audience: It realized that we were supposed to be more than boy-crazy and shallow anorexics.

Blossom Russo (played by the very talented Mayim Bialik) lives with her father Nick and two older brothers, Tony (Michael Stoyanov)and Joey (Joey Lawrence).

Joey, having grown up on television ('gimme a break') was originally set up as the teen heart throb of the series, even having recorded an album. But I was unexplainably drawn to the past' of Tony, the 'older brother', who is now working as a paramedic after having apparently led a wild personal life. He could rescue me any day.

When other teen shows (including some of the other ones which I also watched) were still portraying recovery merely as an excuse to show 'rough' characters, young viewing audiences saw a more compassionate portrait in Tony. Having to work for his sobriety, he struggles--even without the traditional over dramatics assigned to similar characters.

'Tough Love' realistically shows what a recovering addict and their family goes through. Tony Russo cannot stay with his family without first getting and successfully keeping a responsible job. Nick loves his son, but wants his family to take care of and keep themselves healthy.

Nick faces another dilema in 'The Joint' after he discovers the marijuana cigarette Blossom and Six brought into the house. He has to discover who it belongs to--and prevent them from doing this again. He also has to get them to confess, not an easy task when the kids are aware that confessing WILL generate punnishment: He is a musician, but Nick is not that laid-back, he expects his kids to stay clean!

Tony himself saves the day in 'Intervention' because his own history is what enables him to see that a friend of Joey's is becoming hooked on drugs.

Joey (Joey Lawrence) is eye candy, but he does not tend to think things clearly through. So cheating accidentally lands him in an honors class ('Honor?')--where strangely enough the school administration does not question the sudden academic classification of Mr. Russo. They just assume that he now magically had the grades to enter the honors class!

And several episodes show that Tony is working in a position requiring a great deal of responsibility and authority, something which would not have been possible were he not successfully staying sober.

We effectively saw how these other characters own lives ultimately interacted with her own. And because she cares about their well being, she again comes across as an infinently better media role model for a young woman to want to emmulate.

The first and second seasons are bundled together, which is a virtual godsend for both cost and quantity of this series release. The first season only has 13 episodes, so it was essential that season two was added. People either falling in love with this pioneering one-of a kind series for the first time or remembering still-awesome episodes would come away sorely disappointed if only being able to view one season! And waiting out potential releases would have us crawling the walls.",1268438400,3,3203,5.060721062618596

But ... although the DVDs are Region 123456 coded, my region free standalone player won't play them. It says ""disk error"", maybe because of the NTSC format amazon.com is warning about during the buying process ...
The player does play other region 1 NTSC dvds ...",1247356800,,427,4.4743589743589745
3617131,5,B001GP5TMW,"This boxset is a definite must-have for all fans of the show.  By far the best seasons (though still excited that there are more to come), setting up the most important part of the show - the dynamics between Blossom, her two brothers and her dad, Nick.  It's not just the kids that learn lessons, throughout the seasons here, as each cast member seems to learn from the others and - if you find the ease with which 'difficult' issues are dealt with a little too unrealistic, it's important to remember that they were keeping to a filming schedule.  It does deal with some issues that, for its time, were new and no one had attempted to deal with in a realistic way - such as divorce where the mother has left the kids, not the father.  Well worth a watch for all those who remember the late 80's and early 90's - and would be beneficial for all current teens, who suffer from angst after watching the new 90210, The Hills and other shows where the cast have all the power but none of the responsibility - this shows how it used to be done so much better...",1241568000,,1057,4.296482412060302

I also love the character Six played by Jenna Von Oy and I had always wanted the character to ended up with Joey but that did not happen but it was still one of my favorite TV shows of all time.

The extras and interviews are also very good. Regarding all these points this DVD collection would get the full five-star rating from me, no doubt about that, and I will certainly also buy the additional seasons on DVD as soon as they come out. So why did I only give a three-star rating? Because of the picture quality (or, rather, the lack of it). Unfortunately the picture quality is much closer to an aged VHS tape than to a new DVD.

One night I was in the living room watching Tv with my mom(I am a 25 year old female) and I saw a commerical for Blossom seasons 1 and 2 on dvd. Well I was like oh my god. No way and I was so excited because I had been waiting for the longest time for this to come out dvd and or be shown in reruns again. Finally my wish came true. This two season dvd set rocks!! It is totally amazing. It's so neat to go back to how the series started and see how young the cast was especially Blossom,Six and Joey. I lobe seeing them then in the series as teens and then what they look like now(in the comintaries) in their early 30's all grown up. Truly amazing, wonderful, hilarious, heart warming, funny tread setting sensation of a tv series. I was in lobe with Joey lawrence back then and still am. He was gorgeous back in his early 90's Blossom style. Whoa!! Joey was my 2nd celebrity crush. My 1st one was Jordan Knighht of New Kids on the Block. Blossom will forever live on and be cool and a great fav show in my eyes. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out. Seasons 3 and 4 were my fav seasons. I can't wait too more of when Blossom dates Vinnuie(had their first date in the last episode of season 2 and that episode was to be continued so I am anxious to see the rest of it.)",1236038400,,1370,3.949458483754513
