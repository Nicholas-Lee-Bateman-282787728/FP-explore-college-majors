8220827,1,B000W04RUW,The overall quality of the movie is really poor. The sound is also very very bad. Not reccomended at all!!,1367712000,,106,4.35
8220828,4,B000W04RUW,"I have seen this movie more than three times to a point that I ended in purchasing it from Amazon, which is my favorite internet purchasing place.
The main actress, China Zorrila, from Argentina, is such a beloved lady. At her age, over 80 years old, she inspires a lot of passion. She is the famous Elsa in the movies Elsa and Fred. Her role in that movie and this one  is superb, between sadness moments and funny ones she really is a winner. Feeling like a 15 years old when you were really an 80 year woman is something that you have to imitate at least once in your lifetime, like China did in her role in this movie. The love she feels at her age for this young guy is something out of this world. So much beauty, so delicate, so inspiring. The scene when the young guy look at her with so much love and gave her a long big kiss in her mouth was like if you were watching a beautiful painting in the wall. I recommend this movie very highly.",1289865600,,947,4.118918918918919

depressing. Would not see it again.",1288224000,,128,4.608695652173913
8220830,4,B000W04RUW,"Movies I have seen in which China Zorrilla has acted,are of profound meaning and carry a significant message.  Here, we see a person who refuses to accept that life has an ending, and she extracts a meaning and a source of enjoyment going so far as to extract a joke out of her own life, in which she plays dead just to see how it will be when the real end comes through.  A movie worth reviewing now and then, just to keep the perspective.",1213833600,4,440,4.1647058823529415
