2672961,5,B000JJRY7E,This is one of the best products of its kind ever done. Finis Jhung is a magnificent teacher who makes ballet barrework accesible to beginning dancers who hope to improve. You won't find anything better anywhere!,1220745600,8,212,4.916666666666667

The video (as well as all other video's created by Finis Jhung) shows his revolutionary approach to ballet teaching. He starts with the proper posture which helps to maintain your balance. In every exercise he explains the purpose of the exercise, what muscles are involved and what requires special attention. Don't think that the exercises are easy! If you preform them correctly you will feel your muscles working! The most important thing about  this video: it helps to build a solid foundation and enables you to advance quickly. You will be amazed with the results. I also highly recommend other videos by Finis Jhung. It's good to have barrework videos with centerwork videos of a corresponding level as good barre exercises are crucial for the centerwork.  You can also read about Finis and this teaching on his website [...] and see more products. Moreover, Finis uses beautiful music of Scott Killian in his videos and gives very clear instructions for every exercise. The demonstrator performs the exercise and then Finis corrects her and talks about proper performance of each execise.  Enjoy!",1219968000,18,1569,5.995535714285714
2672963,5,B000JJRY7E,"Perfect for beginner level dancers. More than just a supplement to dance class, it supercedes an hour long, fast-paced class. Finis Jhung properly explains how to use your body's energy and strength for each dance move.",1203120000,9,219,5.111111111111111
2672964,5,B000JJRY7E,"I really enjoyed this beginners level ballet workout.  I have to say I was a little surprised, and was definitely challenged by some of the barre exercises,  but I am positive that I will improve the more times I do it. It's great that it's not too easy otherwise it would be boring. Finis describes very clearly how to use the correct technque and why - and i think this is very important for beginners.  I always have classified myself as a beginner because I only got to grade 3 in ballet as a child (never got to do point) and then have done adult beginners ballet classes at dance centres since my late 20's - so have never had professional guidance.  I found Finis gave better instruction that my ballet teachers in a real adult beginners class.  I also have Melissa Lowe's Ballet Workout and although this is very different style of instruction, I am enjoying that as well. I am a little nervous about going to Level 2 barre, so will leave it for a while ;-)",1188950400,46,965,4.368715083798882
2673005,5,B000JJRY7E,"It is very easy to follow for someone that has NEVER taken ballet before.  I am in a beginner ballet class for seniors and though most of the attendees have taken ballet in their youth, I seem to be able to keep up - thanks to this video.  Finis Jhung explains the movement in detail a beginner can understand.  Other DVD's that I bought does things only in one direction, Finis Jhung doesn't do that.",1392422400,4,401,4.32
2673006,5,B000JJRY7E,Excellent DVD. I'm in a beginner ballet class and this DVD makes it so easy to practice at home. Easy to follow Finis and the dancer (Isabella). Couldn't be happier with it!,1392249600,3,173,4.4375
2673007,5,B000JJRY7E,"For an absolute beginner (like me), I can't imagine a better start.  I've tried a number of other DVDs that either create a sort of ballet light that's just cardio with a little arm waving or else if they really are ballet they assume that you've taken ballet class before.  How wonderful to have the opportunity to learn from the very start with this eminent teacher.

Some other reviews seems to suggest that the DVD might be too slow for experienced dancers--I'm sure that may be true. The pace is slow and, I would say, meditative.  If you're an absolute beginner who wants clear, precise, and careful direction that really helps you understand how to control your movement, start here.",1367452800,8,690,4.725
2673008,5,B000JJRY7E,"This is a great supplement for my children's weekly dance lessons. Since though they focus more on contemporary dance in class, this video is especially helpful as the classical ballet techniques help improve all sorts of other dance styles including modern and jazz. The companion to this DVD is the barrework for beginners, but at least half of the exercises in that one require a home barre (very pricey) and can't be done just with a chair back. With this DVD, all you need is a television and lots of floor space!",1311638400,9,518,4.641304347826087
2673009,5,B000JJRY7E,"I'm an adult beginner ballet student and I love Finis Jhung's dvds for the days I don't have class.
This video starts out with very basic center work and builds up to a final waltz dance which is entirely doable for a beginner.

I've been taking ballet for a couple of months now and even though we haven't gotten to most of these steps in my class, I could execute all of them with the exception of the turns, which I just need a little more practice.

The sections of the dvd are as follows, and Finis marks the combination then Isabella Boylston of ABT demonstrates on both sides to music, which you are to follow along with. Between sides, Finis offers corrections and things to think about during the steps.

1. Tendu, degage en l'air, tombe en avant, arabesque balance
2. Tendu, degage en l'air, tombe de cote, cambre
3. Tendu, temps lie en avant, arabesque balance
4. Tendu, temps lie de cote, balance in cou-de-pied
5. Tendu, fondu, degage en l'air, pique en avant
6. Tendu, fondu, degage en l'air, pique de cote
7. Tendu, fondu, degage en l'air, passe par terre en avant
8. Tende efface & croise, devant & derriere, temps lie
9. Tendu with port de bras, tombe
10. Quarter turn en dedans
11. Half turn en dehors
12. The basic waltz step, to the mirror (SO much fun!)
13. The basic waltz step, to the corner
14. Waltz & walk back in a circle on releve, to the mirror
15. Waltz & walk back in a circle on releve, to the corner
16. Stretch

The music is beautiful and makes doing the moves a joy. Finis' way of describing what to look out for when executing a step/turn is second to none and when I follow his instructions, I actually look like a ballet graceful ballet dancer.  The DVD is 70 minutes long.

Though I find his barre dvd a little boring, this is one is a lot of fun with absolutely no dread factor, and I look forward to trying then next level up after I master these.",1300233600,24,1888,4.304225352112676
2673010,5,B000JJRY7E,"Level 1 is so valuable to a dancer of any level.  It's not a challenging barre per se, it's paced slowly and methodically.  What's important about it is the way Finis builds great alignment into every movement and really drills you in how to ""feel"" everything.

Even advanced students will benefit from doing this DVD occasionally to refresh their muscle memory for doing things ""right"".  I was once told at my Vaganova method school that even an accomplished dancer could make him/herself sweat just standing at the barre; this workout is a great example of how very basic movements can be highly therapeutic for the more advanced student or professional.

Each movement he teaches here will pay off in more complex movements learned later.

Ballet classes are great places to learn things wrong.  It's sad to say, but students pass along to each other all kinds of stupid ideas and it's rare to have a teacher who is clear all the time about how to avoid mistakes.  At least in my experience, ballet classes are often a ""sink or swim"" environment where you work out for yourself how do to everything, often by imitation rather than through an intellectual approach.  I would have had a MUCH easier time progressing as a young student if I had had Finis teaching me then.

The real test of your learning process comes when you first become ready to dance en pointe.  If you're struggling with lots of pain, falling down, knuckling over or not fully achieving pointe, compromising your turnout, etc., you need to go back to the fundamentals.  Finis Jhung's classes are the way to go.

Level 2 is a significant step up from this DVD in terms of difficulty level, FYI.  Do be sure you're ready before trying that one.

The only complaint I have with Level 1 is its length. At 90 minutes (and a lot of that is very necessary explanation) it's hard to fit in to a work day.  The level 2 disc is 60 minutes and paced much more quickly.  I compromise by doing Level 1 on the weekends and level 2 during weekdays.",1298419200,32,2006,4.57422969187675
2673011,3,B000JJRY7E,"Finis Jhung knows his stuff and right off the bat he shows you exercises to strengthen your muscles to be able to positions correctly. He's very knowledgeable however I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the video. It appeared to be more of a home movie and I felt I paid too much for what I got. I also expected him to demonstrate the positions of the feet in the beginning, but he didn't. I think that having some previous knowledge about the first positions would help a bit too. Overall it's an ok DVD for someone who is new to ballet but doesn't have the time or money to participate in live classes.",1295654400,12,611,4.275862068965517
2673012,4,B000JJRY7E,"Purchased about a month ago.  The video was very helpful and I use it during the interims in which I am not taking a studio class.  I am a beginner student and so this instructional video helps me to understand fundamental principles of ballet.  It's not easy at all :-)  My only wish is that it covered more techniques, and sometimes it can be a little boring.  It would have greater value if it included both barre and center exercises, but alas, I must spend more money to purchase an additional DVD.",1290988800,7,503,4.423913043478261
2673013,5,B000JJRY7E,is selling it for such a high price? It's $33.99 on Finis Jhung's website. This DVD is a must-have for correcting poor postures too.,1254528000,13,132,4.541666666666667
2673014,5,B000JJRY7E,"This is a great instructional DVD for ballet beginners who want to practice at home and improve their techniques. The teacher, Finis Jhung, is an innovative ballet instructor who has been teaching ballet in New York City since 1972. He gives you concepts, ideas and imagery to work with, which are not commonly used in conventional ballet schools. Even the way he teaches you to use the barre and to work with your placement is different from run-of-the-mill instructions. It is so inspiring.

I originally bought the Level 2 (Advanced Beginners) DVDs because I have been learning ballet as an adult for about a year and a half. But I realized that Jhung has his very own method and I was curious to learn about the basics in order to build a sold foundation as I progress. I don't regret a bit about having purchased the Level 1 Barre DVD. Just the first few exercises are worth more than the money you pay for it. In fact, this is almost as good as a private ballet teacher, except you would want to have a mirror to give yourself corrections. It is important to have a home-practice barre and mirror or access to a ballet studio when you use Finis Jhung's DVDs. Another good thing about the DVD is that the demonstrations show exercises for both left and right sides, so you don't have to keep on rewinding the disc to repeat the other side. The demonstrator is excellent and shows the movements slowly and beautifully -- she isn't only someone whom adult beginners can look up to, but someone whom they can relate to as well.

One word about the music. I didn't like the music in the Level 2 DVDs at all, as the rhythms are really odd and the melodies very ugly. But the music in the Level 1 DVD (composed by the same guy Scott Killian) is quite acceptable.

I highly recommend this DVD to any adult ballet students who want to get a solid grip on their basic techniques, as this will greatly help them build more advanced techniques in the future.

While Finis Jhung's DVDs are pricier than other ballet instruction videos (which I own quite a few), his are definitely more worth every dollar that you pay for, because you get so much out of them.",1223683200,42,2152,4.482142857142857

8151182,5,B000JJRY7E,This DVD is excellent for teenagers/adults who are just starting ballet and for ballet students who really want to hone their technique. I've been using this video a few times a week as a supplement for my weekly (sadly only weekly) ballet classes and after a month I am already feeling a lot more confident with barrework. My teachers have even complimented me on my posture and technique!,1437609600,,390,4.75

8151186,5,B000JJRY7E,Wonderful and Beautifully done! I'm looking for more of His Barre work!,1412812800,,71,5.0
8151187,3,B000JJRY7E,"Finis explains many things quite well, but considering how much the DVD cost, HOW COULD HE NOT INCLUDE rond-de-jambe en l'air and developpe??? Especially considering that he includes a more advanced exercise that comes later in barre, the grand battement. Also, he skips around a bit, explaining some parts quite well, and then other things not at all. The instruction on the fondu is pretty bare-bones. For cost I am not really satisfied. Sadly, this DVD is the best dance technique I've come across.

I do really like Finis as a teacher though!",1405814400,4,546,4.870967741935484
8151188,1,B000JJRY7E,Absolutely boring way too slow - I mean slow !He talked too much. He loved to hear himself speak. He repeated himself too many times . Don't waste your $$.,1404950400,,155,4.2
8151189,3,B000JJRY7E,"Finis Jhung does a great job of clearly explaining the techniques of each move. He is upbeat and knowledgeable and I really appreciate that he takes his time to give us the benefit of his experience. I wish I had been able to find an instructor ""in real life"" who gave as much thought to teaching the fundamentals.

So, why only three stars? THE MUSIC!

Wow, what can I say? If you enjoy morbid sounding, disjointed melodies created with cheap synthesized instruments, then you would love the soundtrack here. It just sucks the energy out of the room. And, being a professional musician myself, I had a really hard time disregarding the awful music. All I can come up with as to why this composer's music was chosen for an otherwise excellent DVD is that he must be a friend of Mr. Jhung's.",1394064000,5,790,4.5174825174825175
