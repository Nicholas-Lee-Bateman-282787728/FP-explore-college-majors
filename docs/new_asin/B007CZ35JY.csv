8514817,4,B007CZ35JY,"Amusingly amoral.  Kay Francis is very charming as a woman who supports herself on breach-of-promise settlements, and Nigel Bruce is perfectly cast as a lecherous old friend.  Kay's charms are fading as she gets older, and so she takes on an apprentice, who of course commits the ultimate faux pas by falling in love.  Oops.",1425600000,2,324,4.8545454545454545

The plot kept my attention and there are several plot twists along the way that show the script was well thought-out. The sets are great and both the cinematography and choreography are quite good. The musical score, while not extensive since this is certainly no musical, enhances the film.

When the action starts, we meet aging gold digger Grace Herbert (Kay Francis) and Grace is starting to have a tough time attracting men--and then cornering them into ""breach of promise"" settlements when she can claim (falsely) that they are backing out of their agreement to marry her. Grace's assistant and maid Josie (Margaret Hamilton) does the best she can to help Grace look as young and beautiful as possible; but we all must age. After failing to meet wealthy men in Lake Placid, Grace and Josie travel to Miami where they meet nineteen year old Ellen Daley (Mildred Coles) who is looking for work. At first Grace thinks she has no work for Ellen--but then Grace realizes that she can train Ellen to attract wealthy men and share the take with her when the men are ultimately set-up for ""breach of promise.""

And there's quite a bit more to the plot from there! While Grace, Josie and Ellen are travelling to Chicago so Ellen can trap wealthy William McDonald Vincent (Nigel Bruce), they get a flat tire and just by chance Tom Dice, a cowboy riding a train stopped nearby changes the tire for them. (I know, what are the chances; but this is Hollywood.) Ellen and Tom fall for each other instantly but they must each go their separate ways. Tom continues riding the train; and a whole lot more happens when Grace teaches Ellen how to handle William so that they can manipulate him into paying a settlement so he can avoid a phony ""breach of promise"" lawsuit. Of course, Grace, Ellen and Josie planned the whole thing with the intent of trapping William; but William doesn't know that--or at least not yet.

Grace, Ellen and Josie then head for New York City to take another wealthy man for all he's got. Unexpectedly, Tom finally sees Ellen when she is out on a date with the very rich Van Payson (George P. Huntley). Ellen truly loves Tom which makes him very different from the others; and this creates numerous complications for everyone involved.

I'll stop here to avoid giving out spoilers; I want you to watch and enjoy this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that there are plot twists just as I mentioned above and the rest of the film shows how all the issues play out.

Look also for good performances by Stanley Andrews as Joseph Shawhan; Selmer Jackson as Fred Dice; Marek Windheim as Dr. Alonso Corivini; Katharine Alexander as Tom's mother Mrs. Dice and Douglas Evans has a cameo as a concert radio announcer.

I recommend Play Girl for fans of the actors in it. In addition, people who enjoy racy movies with romance and even some comedy thrown in will not be disappointed.",1366329600,4,3031,4.62453531598513
8514819,3,B007CZ35JY,"This piece of comedic fluff stars Kay Francis, in the role of Grace Herbert, an over the hill gold digger who sees the writing on the wall. Assisted by her maid, played by Margaret Hamilton of the Wicked Witch of the West fame, she finally decides that it is time to indoctrinate someone younger than her into the fine art of gold digging.

Grace hitches her falling star to Ellen (Mildred Coles), a down and out nineteen year old and teaches the tricks of the trade. Consequently,  both their fortunes increase, as Ellen inveigles her ardent, older male admirers to give her jewels, cars, furs, money, and anything else her heart desires without giving anything back, if you get my drift.

Ellen, however, is not quite hard hearted, and falls in love with a young man who is a rancher. When Grace gleefully reveals something about him that she did not know, Ellen heads for the hills. The movie viewer can look forward to some interesting twists and turns, as all the kinks resolve themselves.

As with any film starring Kay Francis, the viewer can look forward to some beautiful, stylish gowns and excellent acting, despite the shortcomings of the script. Moreover, it was fun seeing Nigel Bruce of Dr. Watson fame doing a comedic turn as a middle-aged lothario. This is a classic early nineteen forties chick flick, and those who are fans of Kay Francis will definitely derive some enjoyment from it.",1345680000,4,1403,4.737704918032787
8514820,4,B007CZ35JY,"I'm a Kay Francis fan & have seen most of her films. This one was new to me & it was great fun. Her supporting cast of Nigel Bruce (Dr Watson fame) & Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) are wonderful. A slightly over the hill gold digger (Francis) teaches a pretty 19 years old the tricks of taking men for all they're worth. Humerous, with an edge & a happy ending. But while watching it I couldn't help thinking how much better it could have been if only - it was pre code rather than post, it had been made at MGM rather than at RKO, her dresses had been by Ory-Kelly, it had been written by Billy Wilder or Preston Sturges, it had been directed by Ernst Lubitch. So many could have beens, but that was true of so much of Kay's career. She was a great star with a unique look & persona. When she's on the screne you only watch her. And you want her career to succeed, to get better parts, screnewriters, directors, etc. But it just didn't happen very often for her. In the late 30's Warners put her in so many poor films (to use up her contract & then dump her) that by the 40's even in a good film like this, nobody came to see it. But you should. I'll certainly watch it again & share it with friends.",1335744000,14,1219,4.083333333333333
