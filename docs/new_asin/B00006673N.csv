7961932,5,B00006673N,"A classic film, well worth watching by anyone with a creative mind set.  As an art instructor, this was a favorite in my Advanced Studio art class every year.  Students were inspired, and as many times as I watched it over the years, it never got boring or old.  Highly recommended.",1452470400,,282,4.490196078431373
7961933,5,B00006673N,"This documentary is an excellent look at the creative process, and how it is shared across mediums.  Bowie fans will definitely enjoy this one.",1193184000,6,143,4.958333333333333
7961934,5,B00006673N,"Listening to artists speak about their process helped get the inspiration burning in me again too.  A good film for any artist of any discipline ~ and for art students too.

Unexpectedly I learned the most from the disciplines most unlike my own -- the choreographer said things which helped me think in new ways  (example -- ""why do artists think they should simplify?  Think of a Forest -- a forest is complex, it is not on a human scale -- there is something different to notice every time you look at it.  The complexity makes it interesting."")  Also the concept of time in art -- and when is a piece of art ""finished""?  (Nora the sculptor feels something is finished when it feels it has been born;  the dancer and choregrapher say a piece is never finished, is always changing)  Compelling thoughts too from David Bowie -- ""People think artists somehow KNOW more than other people.  They don't.  They just DWELL on things more.""",1127347200,12,934,4.6
7961935,5,B00006673N,"I've waited for a long time to purchase this film and I'm so glad it is now available. I saw this documentary at the Santa Barbara Film Festival a few years ago and was deeply moved by the work of the artists profiled as well as by the artists themselves. Some were familiar to me, while others (like sculptor Nora Naranjo-Morse) were a revelation. I think that civilization evolves through individual acts of creation by artists, writers, scientists, and inventors who shape the future with their minds and hearts. Apted's beautiful film lets us inside the minds and hearts of seven remarkable creators, and in doing so he gives all of us new license to explore, rebel, innovate, and grow.",1078704000,17,690,4.758333333333334
