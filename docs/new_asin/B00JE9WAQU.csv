I'll personally refund your money if you don't like the film.",1401753600,,224,4.463414634146342
6355418,5,B00JE9WAQU,"Quiet, intelligent , charming, interesting is one of the few things I can saw about Queen. The year has not even reached its halfway point but I can see this beautiful film occupying a place in the top ten films of the year.
It takes you from the warm by lanes of Delhi to the more colder places in Paris and Amsterdam and captures your heart in that order.
It is a film about an North Indian girl called Rani  (Kangna Ranaut) from Rajori who is about to get married but is deserted  at the last minute by her reluctant fiance ( RajKumar Rao) in a slithering act which makes you cringe at his spaghetti like spine but one can also understand the confusion of the upwardly mobile youth about marriage. Ranis family consists of many amazing characters each of them make the film very rich, her immediate family are just too precious. After Rani has been jilted and she has spend a few days crying, she decides to go on the honeymoon intended as a couple alone, all by herself. Guess what travelling  does to people, it opens up their hearts and mind- I guess Rani is no different. I mean, the culmination of the film is sorta clear from the beginning that this girl is going places but the magic is in the journey and this is where The Queen score big, big points. There are plenty of characters introduced in Europe each of them has a presence and soul but their personality shines through their interactions with Rani. There is the amazing scene in Paris where Rani uses some alcohol to loosen her tongue and sing the unknown song Maine Hothon Se Lagayi Toh from the  1973  Sanjeev Kumar film, Anhonee. Mind blowing madness ensues.
Queen is essentially stepping out of your comfort zone and a coming of age film. Ranis solo honeymoon ultimately provides her with the necessary intimacy and seclusion that she needs to grow and find herself. The detailing is in the script and photography and the many marvelous scenes that this film is made up of.
Queen cannot be the king without the flawless rendition of the lead role by an amazing Kangna Ranaut. I doubt even she believed that she would have delivered this act.....She transforms herself as she enacts a very difficult role, with flawless ease and a maturity far beyond her years. Kangna means bangle and she is one on the film called Queen.
Amit Trivedi is a talented guy and has given some good compositions but the music didn't do much for me, and why does he sing? Only London Thumakda was good.
Vikas Bahl, the director has put himself in a quandry. After making this film, he has set the bench mark even hgiher. No one was waiting for this,  but surely they will waiting for his next one. Enough said, take some time and spend the next 2 and half hours with Rani and surely those memories will last a long time.
Queen also has the best use of the Facebook timeline just watch the closing credits to see for yourself. Not to be missed.",1398470400,21,2894,4.471590909090909

I saw it originally in Delhi when it was first released and I continue to like it two years later. It's really great to see a non-traditional storyline for a woman. You almost never see coming of age/travel stories like this in Bollywood. It's funny, it's very progressive for Indian cinema and has great characters. Overall, one of my favorite hindi films. Also, I watched with a non-Indian and the subtitles for this are pretty good! There are some jokes that still get lost in translation, but I think it's a film that can be enjoyed by Indians and non-Indians alike.",1470700800,,655,4.421487603305785

6355430,5,B00JE9WAQU,"Can't get enough of watching this movie.  Her character reminds me of myself shy, obedient, naive and humble.  Sometimes the pains of life changes you thru time. Its a great movie. I am glad of her experiences she came across that healed her pain and the courage she took of not going back to her fianc, she was just too good for him.",1463184000,,334,4.285714285714286
6355431,5,B00JE9WAQU,"Rani is a great character. Through this movie, one can really get the true meaning of feminism. Those who claim to be anti-feminist should watch this movie, as it shows that at the heart of feminism is the cultural and personal decision of  women not to let men intimidate and manipulate by taking away our voices and our choices; not to let men suppress the spirit of our person.

Rani is a young conservative, obedient and dutiful woman who was pursued in a love relationship only to be dumped at the altar. At first devastated and humiliated, she makes the controversial decision to take her much anticipated European honeymoon by herself. Scared, depressed and lost in Paris, she stumbles across kind and adventurous foreigners who aid in her growth. Although the plot unfolding confronts her with unlikely situations, I nevertheless loved how she tackled them. Finally, the movie's conclusion was one I was rooting for all along.

This movie isn't for everyone, but I think Rani rocks! She is my hero, she is my feminist Queen!",1463011200,2,1032,4.8522727272727275
6355432,5,B00JE9WAQU,"It could all so easily have gone wrong.  It's a paint-by-number plot: sweet, sheltered girl is done wrong by the man she expects to marry. so she breaks free to discover a wide--and wilder--world. Almost always it ends with the girl trying every temptation, especially sleeping with the first cute guy who offers her kindness and a contrast to the louse she left behind, no matter how untrue to the girl's character or culture.

That's where ""Queen"" does everything beautifully, and unexpectedly, right. Part of what makes this film so winning is that while the main character, Rani, explores a lot of unsavory places (bars, the Amsterdam red light district), her innocence brings out the best in the jaded people she meets.  Again, this could have gone terribly sweet and sticky, but Kangana Ranaut makes Rani's decency such a sign of strength as well of purity, that we become equally beguiled and protective of it.

Kangana Ranaut deserves every acting award there is for this role. As she journeys from giddy fianc&eacute;e to shell-shocked jilted bride to overwhelmed tourist to confident world traveler, she is so believable it seems more like a documentary.  There is never a facial expression, gesture, or tone that doesn't seem absolutely authentic and accurate.

She is ably backed by an attractive and talented cast.  Party girl Vijay is played by Lisa Haydon, an Australian-Indian actress with the same caliber of looks and charisma that made Angelina Jolie such a stand-out early on.  Mish Boynko is a cynical Russian artist who, along with 2 other men, take on the role of both defender and guide.

What is especially commendable about this film is the obvious love Rani's family have for one another, and how, even as Rani travels and her viewpoint expands, they remain her true north. As with the Felicity Jones ""Sense and Sensibility,"" they manage to create a caring, cohesive unit.

While some parts of this movie could have used tighter editing--it runs over 2 hours-and some of the flashbacks are initially confusing, this is such a likable, often really funny, film, with such a stellar performance from Kangana Ranaut, it easily earned 5 stars.",1461542400,,2166,4.975069252077562

6355438,5,B00JE9WAQU,"As an old white guy, I have recently started enjoying Bollywood movies. It has been interesting to study the differences between Hindi and American culture. Many of the movies simply endorse a dream of Indian culture and lifestyle. This movie is special because it explores these things with a much more realistic view and they have selected a heroin who is a bit off the mainstream of beautiful and glamorous women actors that I have been smitten with. Dealing with a more real version of the most popular topic, love and marriage, this film is a departure in many ways. Our heroin is a beautiful woman but not presented as a Miss Universe off the cover of some magazine. She comes from a middle class home, not a dream palace and while it has a happy ending, once again it is not traditional. Without becoming an almost militant social commentary, many of the traditional roles and behaviors of Indian women are examined for what they are and I beleived that I was looking at the truth. The part that I really liked about this was that it was so subtle that I found myself immersed in her life, rooting for her and liking every decision that she made and the girl is both smart and funny. I have watched the movie many times, want ing my friends and family to enjoy what I have enjoyed and I still laughed.",1455494400,4,1308,4.476987447698745

I liked that this was about going from woman leaving her family to marry, to a woman just doing her thing!

The first half, her visit to Paris doesnt add up to a whole lot.  It mostly feels like an excuse to shoot singing and dancing in a lot of nightclubs.  But when she moves on to Amsterdam, where she rooms with three quirky guys (from Africa, Japan, and Russia) in a youth hostel, the film becomes more fun, and their growing bonds in spite of tremendous cultural differences gives the story a shape.

A little too goofy at times, but pretty funny at others, and there are a few touching moments as well in that much better 2nd half.  It doesnt add up to a ton, and I doubt Id want to see it again, but it was a pleasant and good-natured way to spend 2.5 hours.",1450137600,2,866,4.296296296296297

Although less Hindi in feel that the rest of the many, many films I have now watched. But even so I can still say this is one of my favorites. A strong lead actress who plays the character sincerely and avoids the typical female stereotype (which is kind of a risk for some of the other female Bollywood stars as much as I absolutely love them for what they do, it is not the same as this kind of portrayal) Plot centers around a naive, timid, traditional, young Indian woman as she addresses gender roles, cultural versus individual demands, determining true emotional affinity....so many things...by connecting with unique characters who like her for who she is...takes place mostly in Europe, but that is part of the plot too, ...

Thoroughly well acted by everyone. The music is only okay, but at least it doesn't interfere. I bought the Blu-ray version and I WARN YOU STRONGLY that the producer, Shemaroo,  SHAMELESSLY places their logo/watermark ON EVERY FRAME OF THE FILM. This I found very distracting and irritating and, worse, THEY ADDED AN ANTI-SMOKING WARNING any time someone was smoking. This is utterly unnecessary and inappropriate, like if you bought a Van Gogh painting and painted your company's logo prominently on it so everyone would see your shameless greed every time they tried to enjoy the work of art. I have written to Shemaroo complaining, and you can too: customerservice@shemaroo.com. Maybe they'll quit if enough people complain.",1438041600,5,966,5.0754716981132075

6355454,5,B00JE9WAQU,"Marvelous, unexpected, beautifully acted piece.  I stumbled on the film while exploring ""foreign"" (to me) comedies and was intrigued by the universal praise it won.  I didn't expect to be so utterly charmed by the heronie's picaresque and beleivable adventures. The plot lines are well-repeated in other reviews here so I'm just adding my reaction as support to their praise.  I was captivated by her hesitant transformation from a relatively passive supporting player role in her prospective husband's life: a ""child"", a prop, a cultural stereotype and living punch-line of the traditional female role, to a dynamic young woman who is the main actor of her life instead.  Started watching this by myself with two teen girls in the room wholly occupied on devices but they quickly got caught up in her adventures, and soon my teenage son and husband sat down to join us as well.  My daughter declared this a fantastic, inspirational movie and one she wants to own and show her friends (boys and girls).  It is now on my wish-list.

All the actors do a great job, but especially the female lead, and her ""immediate"" family. There is a great sensitivity in this film, which accurately portrays emotions we have all felt at one time or another in our lives. I like the balancing of humor, the bar scene is so funny as the lead alternates between anger, and tears. Early on in the film it wasn't clear to me that there were flashbacks to earlier days, w/ the boyfriend. But, on watching a second time, it was a well executed story, comparing her current life (and all the wonderful/terrible people she meets) versus the standards of her fiance. Clearly in the long run, she came out far ahead, especially as portrayed in the final scenes. EXCELLENT! MUST WATCH FILM!

What she does in Queen, her box office conquest, is mesmerizing stuff. I'd even venture to say that, incredibly, her performance tops that of Sridevi's in the similarly-themed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/English-Vinglish-2012-Hindi-Movie-Bollywood-Film-Indian-Cinema-DVD/dp/B00ABW5Q3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">English Vinglish (2012) (Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema DVD)</a>. Like Sridevi, Kangana comes off real and natural and vibrant. I really love this movie.

Like the sign says over that caf wherein Rani's heart gets ripped out: ""A lot can happen over coffee."" For 24-year-old Punjabi girl, Rani Mehra (Kangana Ranaut), of India, from Rajouri Garden in West Delhi, this should've been the happiest time. She's two days away from her nuptials. She and the fam and a multitude of guests had just celebrated her mehendi ceremony. But then comes her unexpected coffee date with her fianc - pardon, her cad of a fianc, Vijay (Rajkummar Rao). Yeah, son, a lot can happen over coffee -  including his breaking off the wedding, never mind that she abjectly pleads with him to not do this. ""Whenever God closes a door, somewhere He opens a window."" That quote is either from the Bible or The Sound of Music, and it applies.

A devastated Rani at last composes herself and here's a kernel of gumption: she decides to go anyway on her pre-booked honeymoon to Paris and to Amsterdam. She goes stag. This changes her life.

Oh, Bollywood, you keep wearing your heart on the sleeve, winning over even someone as prickly and apathetic as myself. But I like that, once in a bit, Bollywood pulls a swerve and rolls out a new sauce like Queen. The emotional arcs in Queen ring true and come about organically. Vikas Bahl - he directed the thing - wanted no part of Bollywood's traditional show of histrionics. Queen is no overwrought three-hankied weeper. Bahl's sure-handed treatment champions thematic grace and narrative clarity. There's not much in the movie that strikes a false note. Okay, maybe the Japanese character played so broadly by Jeffrey Chee Eng Ho. Even Mickey Rooney - who atrociously played ""Mr. Yunioshi"" in Breakfast at Tiffany's - says Ho should tone it down.

There's a fair amount of flashbacks, but they serve to underscore Rani's subservient place in the world. Bound by tradition, constrained by culture, Rani in Paris and in Amsterdam is this meek, mousy creature startled and scandalized by what she sees around her. Holy crap, Kangana Ranaut is brilliant in this movie. Vikas Bahl pulls the strings, but there's no question that Kangana is the heartbeat and the soul. Her poise pulls the picture thru. Credit Bahl for being savvy enough to allow Ranaut to convey as much meaning with her expressive body language as with her dialogue. Her moments of silence occupy these telling emotional spaces. What she does is brave and bold and yet impeccably measured. There's joy in watching her character evolve from self-recrimination to self-assessment to reinvention. For me, the telling moment happens when she's in that nightclub and she flashes back to when her cad of a fianc chastises her for dancing in public. In the present, the camera cuts to a close up of Rani and what we see next is breathtaking, that look of hurt and mortification transmogrifying into aggression and defiance as she proceeds to dance the night away, liberation under way.

And I can't say enough about Lisa Haydon who is indispensable. She's the first friend Rani makes on her trip. Vijaylaxmi - or ""Vijay,"" and imagine how that name impacts Rani - is a free spirit, a bohemian half-Indian, half-French hotel maid in the City of Light. This Vijay plays counter to the other, more vile Vijay. She figures out that Rani desperately needed a friend in Paris, and she commits to that without reservation. Lisa Haydon exudes such a natural flair, I can't help but hope she's this much of a breath of fresh air in real life.

It's not that Rani has taken up after her new pal, although Vijay right away has an unquestionable impact. Rani hasn't completely abandoned her upbringing - she still skypes with her family up to ten times a day (and these are pretty funny scenes, especially when the dad and Rani's younger brother get a load of her sexy pal). But she grows to appreciate this wild child, to the extent that she even voices her concerns about Vijay's lifestyle of carousing and casual sex. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Haydon and Ranaut.

Lately I've been let down by the music in recent Bollywood films I'd watched. The songs in Queen reaffirms my faith in Bollywood's knack for churning out catchy tunes. And even more gratifyingly, songs like ""London thumakda, ""Badra bahar,"" and ""O gujariya"" don't whisk audiences away to some improbable interlude removed from the core narrative. The songs here all propel and enhance the storyline.

So see this movie and pass the good word. Sit back and just be amazed by Kangana Ranaut and her Rani's ultimately indomitable spirit. I thought the ending was pitch perfect. But then I thought the beginning and the middle were also perfect (and, okay, there were even scenes with Taka that were incredibly touching). And there's Rani Mehra far from her comfort zone, dancing uninhibitedly, sharing a cramped hostel room with peculiar gents, boldly planting one on strangers, taking on a dare that her gol gappa will win a cook-off in Amsterdam. I would say Queen was the most accepting Bollywood film I'd seen, except that there's that (I guess) provocative image of a red bra that gets pixeled out. So there are still shackles.

Note that the movie runs just under 2 and a half hours. There's an option for English sub-titles. The DVD's bonus feature:

8650165,5,B00JE9WAQU,"Terrific movie! It doesn't have your typical Bollywood ending yet without giving it away, it's still a feel good movie.  The actress is also not the typical drop dead heavily made up heroine, but the longer you watch her in the movie the more you love her, want to hug her, and cheer for her.  I watched this alone the first time and found myself jumping and clapping for some of her great moments!  The other characters are also great including a jolly female friend she meets in Paris - another great performance.",1526515200,,515,4.516129032258065
