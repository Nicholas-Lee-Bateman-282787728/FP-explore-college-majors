7481649,3,B0170FTFOY,"In Yorgos Lanthimos' ""The Lobster"", anyone who doesn't find love within 45 days gets transformed into the animal of their choosing. Most choose dogs. The characters have names like Short-Sighted Woman, Biscuit Woman, and Lisping Man. To call the film weird would be an understatement, but it's the strange, surreal world and the little details that make it even stranger that are the film's best asset, even if it's not enough to sustain interest for the overlong runtime.

It's this writer's contention that pudgy Colin Farrell is infinitely better than ripped Colin Farrell, and he's definitely the former in this case. He plays David, a lonely architect whose wife has left him, meaning he has to check in to a very specific hotel. Being single is considered a detriment to society, with special value for those who are in committed relationships. In this hotel, you're either part of a couple, turned into an animal, or one of the Loners who rebels against the system and lives out on the fringes. But those who do are hunted down by the hotel's guests, with each capture extending their time. Be a skilled hunter, like the cold and callous Heartless Woman (Aggeliki Papoulia) and you may never run out of time.

David's quiet, seems like a nice guy, but he's a comically bad liar, which makes it funny that everybody seems to believe everything he says. But that could be because of the language, which is plain-spoken and totally free of subtext, making lying all the easier and funnier. He manages to befriend Limping Man (Ben Whishaw) and Lisping Man (John C. Reilly), get courted by the Biscuit Woman (Ashley Jensen), and consider his match-making options, such as the Nosebleed Woman (Jessica Barden).

It's about as ridiculous as it sounds, but like all of the best satire there are kernels of enlightenment. The film is basically one long jab at how we in America perceive love and relationships. In ""The Lobster""'s skewed vision, couples that are having troubles are given a child because children are a cure for all problems, something which is patently false and kind of nuts. Lanthimos builds this world in such a way that it feels fully-realized and authentic, while the cast is deeply committed to playing their roles straight.

As long as Lanthimos is building out the details of skewering relationsip culture the film is a lot of fun. Learning about this world turns out to be more entertaining than living in it, though, and when David escapes to live among the Loners (led by Lea Seydoux) it takes a turn for the dark. The Loners turn out to be just as strict as the couples, denying their members any shot at finding true love. So when David and the Short-Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz) begin to fall for one another, they've got all of society looking to contend with.

Credit Lanthimos for taking on an insanely complex love story that challenges social constructs, but the film works better as a satirical piece. Without its sense of humor ""The Lobster"" drags on and loses much of its edge, becoming just another film that's weird for the sake of being weird. But there's no denying how unique this film is in just about every way. It takes an unusual approach, but it may have you rethinking what it means to be single. Maybe being alone isn't so bad. You could always be turned into a lobster.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lobster-UK-import-Region-2-PAL-format/dp/B0170FTFOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lobster [UK import, Region 2 PAL format</a>]",1463788800,4,3526,5.010238907849829
7481650,5,B0170FTFOY,"The  Lobster is a slow paced, but ultimately interesting to watch movie, that certainly gives you plenty to talk about and debate with others who have also seen it.  It's a movie where you've got to accept certain things as being the reality in an alternative universe similar to our own but with a few main changes.  In this world, being single is not acceptable (at least for adults we aren't really told much about children and how old you need to be for the rules to appy). Through plays which take the place of lame videos we are forced to watch in schools or workplace training, we learn that being alone is dangerous as you can choke to death if eating, or be attacked by predators if walking alone.  So the rules society has are that if you break up with someone or your partner dies you must find a new partner straight away, in the case of the main and other characters in the same situation in this film, they have become single, some a partner just died, and they are forced to attend these prisons (""or hotels""), where they are told they have 45 days to find someone from the pool of other singles in the hotel and fall in love. If you fail to do so in the timeframe you are turned into an animal you chose when you were admitted to the prison ""hotel"". The number of days can be extended if hotel guests while on mandatory group hunts find and shoot with a tranqualiser non conformists to the rules of society who live in the woods.  Those people are harvested for their blood or something.  The 45 days can be shortened if you disobey the hotel rules, such as not, (using a Seinfeld term), being master of your domain.  If you get caught pretending you have fallen in love you will instantly be turned into an animal.  There are other painful punishments as well.  The main character David who we follow events through, has picked to be turned into a lobster if he is unsuccessful in finding a partner.  He has also brought with him his brother who was previously turned into a border collie.

The Lobster is slow paced, and it is the type of movie you're probably better off to be wide awake for and not something to put on after a long week at work before you go to bed.  There is some animal cruelty (although it is obviously fake but may still be disturbing for some), the film starts off with a woman pulling up in a car to a field, pulling out a handgun and shooting a donkey in the head.  It's not explained if he was a former partner to her sibling or kid or what, but it happens.

It's certainly an intriguing film and does leave some things ambiguous, and viewers with questions as to what happens in some circumstances in this society, including what happens at the end of the film and even if people are really turned into animals or is this just like in our world where some religions believe certain things will happen once you die type thing, and the government is running some big control the masses con. Does this society even have an afterlife in their belief system. Perhaps they do which is why most conform to the rules obediently.  But this sort of unanswered viewing just fuels intelligent debate amongst those who have watched it.  The Lobster is certainly an interesting film, and one well worth checking out.",1463184000,3,3248,4.406354515050167
7481651,1,B0170FTFOY,"V E R Y S L O W  Nonsensical movie. -5 STARS
Colin Farrell stars as David, a man who has just been dumped by his wife. To make matters worse, David lives in a society with his brother who was turned into a dog .
He has 45 days to find true love  or else he will be turned into an animal and released into the woods.

What a slow nonsensical movie.

It was billed as a thriller Critics Consensus: As strange as it is thrillingly ambitious, The Lobster is definitely an acquired taste  .

*****Yes an acquired taste  for dog doo.******  What  a dud  and waste of time
No meaning what so ever.

Colin Farrell  and Rachel Weisz  must have owed somebody a very very large favor.

**********  This movie Worldwide Box Office was $6,414,923 *****************
This should give you an idea of how bad a movie it was and how stupid I was for watching the entire garbage.
I just kept waiting for something to happen . But NOT",1462665600,6,914,4.232558139534884
7481652,5,B0170FTFOY,"This is an incredible, and original film....peel away the first layer if you originally disliked....and watch it again in freshness of new spirit...and maybe everything will fall into place  hopefully youll find a deeper and satisfactory answer to this dark tale  a story that you will touch and puzzle you with an understanding of weirdness of this strange film...

I disliked the film initially..... I was not quite ready or in the mood to savour an extraordinary film....and so I watched it the next day....and sure enough, I have found wisdom and maturity in a venture of an answer..... I am not trying to be funny here, but I really do like the nature of this film on second viewing?

The Lobster is a film of very dark humour; the characters really do gel together in delicious contrast of entertainment of cinematic drama: It is certainly not a comedy though. In my opinion, the film profoundly offers an alternative vision of how -the futile seeds of shallow indifference -could develop into warfare of misconceived ideas.... An idea that will stranglehold the very thought of love: A love that really should have one meaning only; and that is a love to share in desire of purity. The film ingeniously questions love in manipulation against the horrible thoughts of loneliness it is thought provoking?

I believe now that the film is a classic  it reminds me of another film; namely, Life is a Bed of Roses, and I feel this is a film of very high quality... I will look forward to view future films from the directors chair of Yorgos Lanthimos: Extraordinary!",1462147200,4,1567,4.763837638376383
7481653,5,B0170FTFOY,"The Lobster is an idiosyncratic, quirky, unconventional view of a sexual dystopia. The premise is that in a undefined future people find partners at a resort where, if they do not find a partner within a specific time, they turn into an animal of their choice. They are then released to the forest where they are hunted like any other animal.

What follows is not a spoiler, because more than anything else, this movie is an experience, albeit a moody one.

This movie is a terrific downer. There is a constant overcast in outside scenes (it was filmed in Ireland). The emotional aspect of meeting, finding, or courting a partner is completely absent. Sex with the maids are mandatory and is performed like a factory production line. There is no joy of sex.  There is no excitement of expectation at dances. Every aspect of finding a partner is considered a chore, with a constant realization that if one is not found   ironically, the resort must consider the partnering to be genuine   you are going to be turned into an animal, hunted and killed. Colin Farrells introduction to the resort resembles being inducted into the army. It is no future I would want to be a part of.

Still, every aspect of this movie is terrific. The acting, direction and every other aspect of the movie is masterful. The supporting roles are strong. John C. Reilly, especially, is good. This cannot be considered a feel good movie  because it definitely will NOT. This movie will not cheer you up. It will, however, make you feel grateful that you are living, for all its faults, in present times and not in the future depicted in the film.",1458950400,68,1621,4.659649122807018
7481654,5,B0170FTFOY,"Spoiler Alert:
This original and imaginative dark comedy by Greek writer/ director Yorgos Lanthimos is set in a dystopia where being single or loner is essentially a crime, and only a short time is allowed to find a matching partner, usually through the sharing of a conspicuous characteristic (like you both have a chronic nose bleed). Fail this and you are taken to a special room and irreversibly transformed into the animal of your choice.
Colin Farrell gives a career -defining performance as the main protagonist David, who must rebel against such draconian authority and find a way to survive. John C. Reilly, Rachel Weisz and Ben Whishaw are great as some of the other loners, Olivia Colman is the merciless hotel manager (won Best Supporting role at 2015 BIFA) , and L&eacute;a Seydoux is the sadistic rebel leader. One of my favorite characters was the heartless loner woman played by Angeliki Papoulia.
The premise may sound bizarre, but the film is highly engaging, refreshingly-consistent, the dialogue zany yet stern, and the story vastly-allegorical, with references to re-incarnation, mass cleansings, and the power of individual. The similarities to the Nazi exterminations are chilling, with the upscale hotel replacing the concentration camps, and the loners dancing to a live band replacing the music the prisoners were forced to listen to on their march to the gas chambers.
This film is also a social commentary that depicts a form of personal narcissism that has become so unrestrained it is self-annihilating (Its better to isolate and die than to try to share and live), and a society that has become so frighteningly conformist, its only happy to oblige the authorities (World Order anyone?). Lanthimos is a genius, and his stories have an originality that is unparalleled by his contemporaries (see his 2011 film Alps).
This is an adult film that will make you think about it for days afterwards. It won the Jury Prize at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. Beware mature scenes, which include kinky sex as well as graphic violence done to a dog. The extras includes interviews by the cast that is helps to understand the story better.",1457827200,26,2157,5.027932960893855

(I actually doubt many of the bad reviewers saw the film since some of their claims didn't actually happen in the film). I really enjoyed the commentary on society and how we view being single and being in a couple. Both sides of these worlds presented in the films are absurd extremes, to the point of humorous. But I found, while extreme, I could relate to things I've heard couples say of singles, and singles say of couples to be true in real life. As humans, we want to define everything and everyone. And this film does a great job of exploring that. Yes, there is some violence, but nothing too drastic. And the humor is acquired, so it might not be for the average movie goer who wants to feel good at the end of a film. And that's okay. This movie probably won't be for you. But, if you'd like to watch an interesting plot and characters, I recommend it.",1533600000,,952,4.324022346368715

7481710,2,B0170FTFOY,"The Lobster is an absurdist deadpan satire of how society is so couple-fixated.  In the film, being single means having to hide out in the forest or risk being turned into an animal.  You must be a ""suitable couple"" as dictated by the authorities, although that means you only need to have one thing in common e.g. you both have a limp, or you both are near-sighted, or you both frequently get bloody noses for no apparent reason.

Deadpan is the key word  to describe this film as the actors deliver their lines in bland mono-tone and with absolute straight faces resulting in occasional brief moments of extremely subtle humor.  I did laugh out loud twice: first, when the main character is asked what animal he will want to be changed into if he fails to find a suitable partner within 45 days, and after having responded 'a lobster,' the hotel manager gives an approving smile and says with all sincerity that it was an excellent choice.  Secondly, when the manager tells a new couple that if they start having any issues, ""you will be assigned children.""  That's about as outwardly funny as it gets, so if you're scratching your head at that, then you can stop reading this review and take a pass on this film.

I think the writer/director was probably only interested in reaching a niche audience who would appreciate his message and off-beat style.  I do like out-of-the-box ideas for films, but for me, this one was not enjoyable to watch.  A woman jumps from a building in an attempt to commit suicide and is ridiculed by the main character (as part of the plot) as she is moaning in pain in a pool of blood.  As others have already mentioned, a woman informs the main character that she has just kicked his dog to death (you see the bloody dead dog and her bloody leg), but it was made even worse by the fact that it was his brother (who had previously failed to find a partner within 45 days).  I won't ruin the ending, but it is equally as dark, although fortunately we didn't actually have to see it (for those who have watched this film, please pardon the double pun).

If you like to analyze, discuss, and debate the symbolism, metaphors, and meaning of unusual, thought-provoking films, then this might just be for you.  If you're looking for the stereotypical rom-com, then run far away in the opposite direction.",1520812800,,2330,4.569711538461538

7481725,5,B0170FTFOY,"Interesting but very bleak. Reminded me of Farenheit 451, but with better acting and more humor--at least in the first half before we run into the bleakness of the singles colony. Colin Farrell was perfect in the role, giving it all the nuance the role needed for the film to work. This worked a bit like a futuristic dystopian Everyman, and would not have come off without Farrell creating an Everyman we could identify with and yet feel distant from. I can't see myself watching this again, but it is definitely worth a first view.

I'm having to move this up to five stars from four stars because there are so many bonkers reviews here claiming that a dog was kicked on screen. The action was off screen, the psychopath was punished, the hero being tested by the psychopath ""failed"" because he expressed feelings. What forum did this misinformation about the scene wind up at so that loads of people who did not see the movie wound up reviewing here? The moral choice was very clearly supported here by the film maker. I suppose it should be considered interesting that the same black and white societal views that inflict blindness in the film, should also be seen to lead to blindness in customer film reviews. And I suppose that makes this film a more successful mirror of present society than I thought, so the director clearly deserves five stars. This has more that 3,900 reviews as of today for a movie which was never viewed as a mainstream film. This is a suspiciously high number of reviews as anyone who looks around Prime can tell. Clearly this--given the bizarrely high number of reviews and the misinformation provided about the scene--has hit some kind of forum encouraging people who have not seen the film to down rate it.",1518825600,16,1742,4.6742671009771986

7481733,3,B0170FTFOY,"Great quirky premise but the direction goes missing midway into what could have been an classic film. I actually loved a lot  about this film especially the cast. It was superb. Im also glad the director included some of the Greek cast from his earlier films ALPS and Dogtooth. I hate reading tedious film reviews after seeing a tedious film so I will go down a quick list of PROS and CONS.

PROS:
Casting was well done. I don't like seeing big name and established stars in indie films (for obvious reasons) but it works here. I see past Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz and didn't even recognize former Bond girl and Mission Impossible girl Lea Seydoux (I was thinking it was Kate Moss)
Story was original and brilliant. Keeps telling a tight and intricate story flush with character developments and  well as character deconstructions.
Cinematography is beautifully shot with great vivid scenes. Again after seeing the lower budgets films from this director it was great to see his vision done with a bigger budget.
CONS:
Pacing could have been tighter. There is a lot of scenes later on in the film where characters are just sitting around doing nothing. By contrast earlier on in the film there are a lot of intricate scenes where some sort of important character/relationship development are being made that are rushed through.
Unbalanced storytelling. A bulk of the movies take away is Farrells relationship with Weisz. In fact their relationship is so important we find late on in the movie that she is narrating the early 75% of the film in which she is not even a part of. Furthermore the last scene where we are shown Farrell taking the test for true love and companionship hinges on what we see of him a Weisz on screen. Sadly there was not much on screen time between the two of them when compared to early screen times of Farrell in other scenes with other people. I wouldve wanted the film to have a bit more of Farrell/Weisz in the movie.

OVER ALL: I highly recommend this film and praise the directors vision and execution in procuring a decent and thought provoking audience experience. I think tighter editing and more focus on the key relationship would have benefitted the final product.",1517788800,,2207,4.724675324675324

7481751,5,B0170FTFOY,"I waited a whole day before reviewing this. It deserves that much time, and it deserves to be watched with patience and your full attention. If you are looking to be entertained, go elsewhere. If you are looking for something completely original that makes you question reality and love, then watch this. The opening shot is extraordinarily beautiful yet disturbing. Ive read a lot of reviews by people that love one half of the film or settings, but hate the other half. They belong together. The cinematography through the entire film is beautiful, and the musical score is a perfect compliment. Many scenes of this film reminded me of portions of Melancholia.

The film is about love and lies. What are the limits, boundaries, and expectations we impose upon ourselves as a society, and as individuals?Can we move beyond them? Will we make life better or worse if we try to? What is the cost of imposing rules like these on a society? You may have read that the main character is doomed to be turned into an animal (a lobster, his choice) if he doesnt find a love match within 45 days. True, with a few disclaimers, which I won't spoil. As a viewer, you could get really particular and start asking detailed questions about the rules of this society, or the alternative group of people that rebel against these rules. So go ahead, because maybe we should question the superficial means of expressing love in our current culture. As well as the meaning of unconditional love, commitment, loyalty, gender roles in a romantic relationships, and the toll of lies on relationships and culture.

I keep going back to this film in my head. Many reviewers cited their dislike of the so-called stilted or unfeeling behavior of the characters. I remain convinced that it couldn't be any other way. Everything about this reality is based on lies. It reminded me of the movie The Lives of Others. When you trust no one and cant tell even the person that you love the most the truth, and even that relationship is required to be based on something superficial, then how can anything a person does be authentic? Life becomes about appearances and emotions become buried, meaningless, and hard to find. You find a new language. How can we find our true selves, much less a person that will accept and love that self? What do we have to give up in order to find that, and are we really even doing that in our current society? Why do we willingly participate in a culture that judges our most innermost thoughts and feelings by the most obvious superficial elements? Why aren't we judging people on their authentic selves, their heartless souls, rather than haircuts and outward appearances?

And as a totally bizarre comparison, today I watched Florence Foster Jenkins. A completely different and much more conventional type of movie that was a graceful and beautiful depiction of unconditional love and acceptance of your life mate. Non-traditional love, and an interesting compliment to The Lobster.",1515888000,,2988,4.820662768031189

And once I thought about how hard it must be to do a good job of wooden acting and total deadpan dialog I really came to appreciate it.

Having said that, I do appreciate it as a work of art. The social commentary is expressed in a unique, if disturbing, way.

I get that it's a comment on societal pressure and conformity, but it was just too dark, absurd, and unentertaining for me. And I don't like being left hanging at the end. I admit, if I want something dark and thought-provoking, I prefer a book. When I watch a film, I prefer it to be light and entertaining (not as far as being insulting to my intelligence). This film was not that. I agree with other reviews - you will either like it or you won't. Kind of like how there is no compromise in the plot. Read the good reviews because they will be spot on based on what kind of film you generally like.

 Im not much of a film person, so I cant do justice to the film or to helping you to know what to expect.
 Maybe like me you hear, dark comedy or, Cerebral, original, masterpiece and think, Meh, Ill pass. As for me, I usually get trapped by the dark; and I tend to prefer my movies easy.
My feeble mind again perhaps?
Maybe.
But I will add that during this film, while I was often sad, wondering, hoping, despairing, I did get quite a few surprised, ticklish, delighted laughs.
In the end, for me, it was a work of art from start to finish.
So maybe if you, like me, are on the fence about watching this, cuz you like your comedies broad, your endings clearly defined, and etc, maybe give yourself the chance to get lost in the brilliant performances, the gorgeous soundtrack, the sometimes disturbing sometimes magical always stimulating visual feast.

**SPOILERS**

It requires some thinking in order to decipher the commentary that is being made throughout the film about various topics including relationships, dating, friendships, being single, and finding the ""one."" I thought that the film portrayed society very accurately and I enjoyed being shaken out of some of the inconsistencies that I have when it comes to relationships, such as expecting true love to be found only in someone who I have things in common with (such as two people with nosebleeds making a match). Also, how dating feels like you are advertising yourself to an endless line of people with meaningless one liners (""my special characteristic is that I have a limp""), about how being single can sometimes feel like a very defensive status (the loners are not allowed to have any romantic contact and going around trying to ruin people's relationships), and societal pressure to be in a relationship (the maid going to the trouble of seducing David in order to trigger his interest in a relationship was really quite something).

The movie made me think and was memorable, which I think is the best thing about it. The next time I find myself searching for someone with meaningless commonalities with myself, I will remember the guy in this movie who gave himself nosebleeds in order to find a relationship and maybe I'll snap out of it.",1508803200,6,1437,4.881147540983607

Also kept thinking of what animal I would want to be.  Definitely, a bird.",1508198400,,396,4.297297297297297
7481849,4,B0170FTFOY,"Travis S is correct in his reviews, I believe.  I want to write aq review now before I forget, but will admit I am the kind of person who misses a lot the first time around, but catches exponentially more the second...  So let me summarize my whole review with a blurb from Travis:  ""...A ridiculous premise, that everyone is absolutely on board with.""  Absolutely!!!
The realities of this movie would never exist in the real world - but I believe it's all about the message/goals/conflicts - told in unique concepts and absurd activities.  What makes it brilliant is not just what they say (which are valid points), but HOW they say it.  And what they do about it.  Put it this way:  Having 2 people argue in the forest while a camel casually wanders across the screen in the background actually makes total sense, and the image reminds you of what is at stake here for Collin's character.  And many others for that matter.  I also liked the cinematography; sometimes the camera angles were a little odd to me, but other times they captured the essence of the moment.",1508112000,,1068,4.573684210526316

7481854,5,B0170FTFOY,"In this dystopian future we have a bifurcated society. In the city, romantic couples reign supreme, taking similar interests to the height of absurdity. If you should uncouple, for whatever reason, if you are without a running mate, then you must go directly to the Hotel, where conformity is key. There you will have 45 days to become part of a couple again or be transformed into an animal of your choice. Of course, one can extend the number of days to one's deadline in a most unusual way. Conversely, there are the Loners, a group who lives  in the woods, where romantic relationships are decidedly frowned upon and transgressors face serious consequences. Again, conformity is key.

The acting is mannered, with a deadpan, flat affect, almost as if all were automatons. The cast is excellent, as this is not an easy manner to affect and, at the same time, convey all that they need to in order for this highly nuanced film to come together. This film is simply brilliant, thematically complex, providing much food for thought. It is everything an indie film should be. Kudos to the director. I loved it! Bravo!",1507507200,2,1116,4.747422680412371
7481855,4,B0170FTFOY,"This is a film which will not appeal to all, as it is purposely alienating in its exploration of loneliness, ingroup and outgroup effects, and desperation. I already feel like society often punishes people for being alone, so this wasn't that far a stretch of the imagination. It is hardly surprising that everyone acts very wooden around each other when almost all relationships are based upon absolute triviality (the guitar playing couple is the only one I see as having true long term potential). The most interesting part to me is how the loners punish themselves as well- enforcing the opposite rules. I don't want to spoil the ending.",1507507200,,641,4.889908256880734

The Lobster is more like.... if Ingmar Bergman tried to make a Wes Anderson film. It just didn't quite *work* for me. I mean, I understood that it was intended to be deeply stylized and acerbic.

So much food for thought and interpretation here. It's up for grabs. This is not a film for someone looking for a neatly crafted story line that's easy to follow. Though there definitely is a story line, it wanders into territory that feels a little like ""Waiting for Godot"" meets ""Equis"" at a futuristic adult camp for singles ... Or not. Me, I loved it.

And she says it in such a monotone way that makes it clear even she's not even remotely interested in what she is reading. And to say this film is a ""black comedy"" is completely inaccurate. It's an incredibly dark film that is never really humorous. In fact the only humorous thing is the painfully wooden acting by the cast. It's so bland and emotionless that it's almost laughable at times.

This movie has the everyday strangeness of either, but not nearly the amount of humor, and triple the cruelty, both emotional and physical.  I did laugh several times at various absurdities, but they didn't pyramid into something greater.  It was like watching a traditional comedy that was nothing but one-liners, with no linking plot.  This movie had a sequence of scenes, but no sense of rising tension or rising involvement.

Ben Whishaw is completely wasted as a man trying to turn his limp into love.  Colin Farrell is excellent, as is Olivia Colman.  La Seydoux is appropriately chilling.  All of the actors involved deserve better parts

Brutality for trivial infractions of ""rules"" similarly reflects the Irish character where permanent bodily injuries via ""capping"" were inflicted in the Northern Ireland dispute over whether all persons should bow down to the Pope's Nose or the Archbishop's Throne.  That the ""Loners"" in the film were also prohibited from sexual relations was a further demonstration of the same Irish perversity.  Includes the use of medifrauds to torture, maim, and cripple as in the ""Affordable Care Act"" Loonie Tied Studs of Merka.  As a sociological demonstration of the structural nature of the society of Ireland, the rest of the Untied Queendumb, and the royalists ruling the former United States of America this film was worthy of a four star rating.

WARNING the show does get grotesque (so surely not for all audiences), but despite all of it is very deep and viewers will either hate or love this one (there will be no in between).  It is mesmerizing in its oddity (very strange), and it's exceptionally daring and challenging to social norms.  This story isn't willing to settle for anything simple in any way.  Lots of deep thinking and extreme complexity that most may not understand or be willing to honestly face (look in the mirror and see the truth of society and oneself is hard to do).  It emphasizes a world free of ambiguity. During the intake process at the Hotel they do not have a bisexual option on its census, or half-sizes in the shoes it issues to residents. This society has no nuance or compromise. Everything is meant to be black and white:  The characters are fabulously acting in their roles.  Extremely off beat sensibilities.  Satire concerning societys dating rules and power struggles are moving yet weird.  Bold, stunning and singular  your eyes open to a new storytelling way.  Satire of a society fixed on being a couple explores superficial systems of courtship.  Very disturbing tale, but it is absurdist comedy.

But the makers of this film are not brilliant at all.  They are boring.  Boring beyond belief. They are not outre. They are obvious. Here is the thing: when characters in front of a camera completely fail to engage the viewer and the actors come across as the highly paid puppets they more often than not are, then attention wanders quite naturally to what is going on behind the camera and one wonders with a groan who the hell is responsible for the time-wasting bilge one is enduring.

There is a disgusting moment involving brutal animal abuse which is graphic and completely unnecessary to advance the plot forward--yes, they do tie it in, but there was no need for this since the plot is a disorganized mess anyway, so they could have thrown in just about anything and get the same outcome in the plot.  I could probably get into ways that this movie seems to be a critique of modern society and the culture for couples vs. singles blah blah... but really, just don't watch this because it's not worth your time.",1495843200,2,884,4.333333333333333

At least you're lulled into thinking something actually happened.
I kept watching until I just couldn't take any more. The weird woman who, well, does what she did with the brother just was it for me and I dropped out. I'm mystified what this was supposed to mean or what it was trying to convey...if anything. Pointless, a dragging bore, and just distasteful.

I guess it could be interpreted in several ways, but I saw the premise as both sad and hilarious in an outrageous sort of way. What I will say though, is that the dystopian vibe of the film might be unsettling for some viewers. Also, I wish the ending hadn't been left as open as it was, but it didn't sour my mood towards the film.

Another scene is when Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz pretend to be a couple while pretending not to be in love.  They can't keep their hands off of each other, but they also don;t want to let on that they have broken the rule of loners.  So, they are very conflicted.  But the scene demonstrates the sheer chemistry between them and encapsulates their acting ability because the scene is at once very funny, titillating, sweet, touching, tension-filled, sub-textual, endearing, and satisfying.

Loneliness and couple-dom are topsy-turvy, their premises pushed to the edge, then waaaaay beyond the boundaries of logic as conceived by nominal societal constraints.  This is what is brilliant about the film.  The loner colony in the woods are survivors. The odd flamingo or camel in the background are not odd at all; they have just failed a failure as defined by society.  The condemned are markers for those overcoming.

7482051,5,B0170FTFOY,"Colin Ferrell's finest film. He galls as a pudgy, emotionally-stunted divorcee who hopes to remain physically and intellectually short-sighted after he's turned into an animal of his choice for failing to remain wedded to a woman in this acerbic study of a warped society populated by neocons. And special mention must be made of journeyman actor John C. Reilly (Chicago, Talladega Nights) who proves a funny physical foil to Collins' steady presence. Reilly left Danish director Lars Von Trier's 2005 film, ""Manderlay"" to protest against that production's murder of a donkey; ironically, Greek director/writer Yorgos Lanthimos' ""The Lobster"" opens with the shooting death of a donkey!

A that is just the beginning of a sombre, scathing, all-encompassing pantomime on the sterility of most unexamined human relationships. Reflecting on life as it is in present day, where most people think finding something in common with a lover is a must and that marriage is for children, this morbid morality tale reveals the outliers as no better than the civilized, and even rogues outside of those two sides are hopelessly inadequate. The dystopian future presented is a common sic-fi trope, which I first kenned to in 1974's science fiction classic ""House of Stairs"" by William Sleator. Even the proscribed ""awkward dancing"" in the film is present in this novel of 5 teens kidnapped and programmed to fit into a rigid society.

The Lobster's narrative and its anti-protagonist crawl along, scavenging for gloomy scraps no other creature will eat, until an unbearable grimness grips the heart; but the end provides a release that cunning viewers will translate into a task to be less ordinary human beings.  It's best to absorb this film on its own terms and internal logic; do not superimpose your own values on the narrative, and open your heart and mind to the characters' choices and the painful journey they must endure for civility's sake-- from barely human, to inhuman, to finally, not human at all--- and not even the sense of a camel lost in the woods.",1491696000,2,2054,5.071005917159764

7482066,5,B0170FTFOY,"First, this film is fantastic. I loved it so much that I watched it twice (I was a little tired the first time around).
Second, The Lobster was mis-marketed and I imagine that that accounts for some of the poor ratings. The trailers were edited in such a really misleading way.

This is a cerebral film about the nature of human relationships. While jokes abound, one can only enjoy them if he/she enjoys dark humor and has spent a little time questioning many of the social norms to which 'normal' people of 'western civilized' society submit and the actual viability of humanity.

I really can't speak highly enough about the attention to detail and the understanding of human interaction that The Lobster demonstrates. It should probably have a companion reader.

As for the ending, which may throw viewers for a loop, ask yourself, ""If not for that, what would they have in common?""",1490400000,9,886,4.777777777777778
7482067,2,B0170FTFOY,"People will have all kinds of reactions to this film - but in my opinion, where the film ultimately fails is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.  It is an absurdist tale, that is true - and for some, that will be enough to turn it off - as it is devoid of any real logical explanations that could act as an anchor, and stabilize it.  It is a cold, bleak tale that starts off with some mild humor, but soon devolves into fits of dispassionate violence, blood, awkward sex, and overall cruelty.  If you find that kind of thing funny, just because it is in start contrast to our expectations of entertainment, or because it is truly satirizing social mores and norms, then, you might enjoy ""The Lobster"" - but for me, the satire wore thin very quickly, mostly because I didn't care at all about any of the characters, and there were no stakes introduced that made the achievement or non-achievement of their goals a very compelling narrative.  Stylistically, it seemed a pastiche of Wes Anderson, Woody Allen, and maybe Monty Python? Or even reminiscent of very dark comedies like ""Delicatessen"" - but without the subtle ways in which filmmakers use to bring the audience ""in on the joke""  - the film is colorless, cold, impersonal, passionless - perhaps that is part of the ""genius"" that others see in this film, as it accurately reflects the world that these characters inhabit - but is that enough to either entertain, enlighten, inform,  or intrigue an audience?  It wasn't for me - I found myself bored by the middle of the film, and I continued on out of obligation - perhaps it would somehow pay off in the end?  But it doesn't.  I found it  a little unsettling, and I definitely spent the following day contemplating the subtext, the ""deeper meanings"" that perhaps the filmmakers were trying to convey - and I decided it ultimately wasn't worth my time or consideration.  There are definitely themes that are well-explored here, but they've been explored before in more meaningful ways - despite the appearance of real DEPTH, without the ability to connect with any of the characters, it ultimately made the film feel very shallow and rather empty.  A very big disappointment.  I give it two stars rather than one, only for ambition.",1490313600,9,2244,4.66497461928934

7482071,1,B0170FTFOY,"I really gave this movie a chance, because I wanted it to get to the part where it started to make some sort of sense, and kept hoping it would resemble the trailer in some way. The storyline could have been good if the movie had done anything to set up the premise properly. As it is,no context whatsoever gets provided and pretty much everything goes entirely unexplained. The result is that the whole thing is just confusing and the conflicts in its own plot fight against each other to make it worse. For example, if all the singles supposedly have 45 days to pair up, then what is the point of them hunting each other in those 45 days? Is this a sci-fi movie about a world where you can't live alone, or is it the Hunger Games? Further, if the main character's objective is to pair up, why choose the least possible compatible person he can find?

But those aren't the biggest problems with this film. It's just simply too dark. Nothing in the story or the characters within the first hour have any redeeming qualities or provide the viewer with anything to root for. The entire premise is based on a completely psychopathic set of tenets that this society seems to function in without questioning them at all, not even the main character. When there is a cruel and senseless killing of an animal which is totally unnecessary to the already fumbling plot, I finally threw in the towel. There isn't even any sheer entertainment value, much less anything else. It's clear this film will never arrive at a point worth making.",1489795200,2,1527,4.552727272727273

I went into it understanding that it was going to be filled with dry and sometimes dark humor (I watched the extended trailer).  There were several moments where I genuinely guffawed at absurd situations, facial expressions and social interactions.

By the time the movie arrives as the darkest points (that involve painful bellowing, animal cruelty etc.) I felt like I was too far into the movie and just needed to commit to finish it out.  Skip this title if you're not fond of absurdist films, obviously, but also skip this one if your preference is for the lighter shade of dark humor.",1489622400,,659,4.7631578947368425

The social commentary is poorly veiled and lacks wit or depth. The absurdism that permeates the movie isn't contained in any kind of framework that would otherwise give the disjointed components of this film even a semblance of cohesiveness. The premise has potential, but the lack of character depth on either a superficial or profound level makes this story completely unbearable. You will spend the entire movie waiting for something to develop, but unfortunately, it never does.

7482134,5,B0170FTFOY,"One of 2016's most unique and bizarre films is the pitch-black comedy, ""The Lobster"". Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, an idiosyncratic Greek 'angry young man' filmmaker who had previously garnered both praise and excoriation with his 2009 Oscar-nominated ""Dogtooth"", this provocative and uncompromising surrealist masterpiece is set in a dystopian near-future in which only couples are allowed to survive. If any unfortunate citizen should become single through divorce or death, they are given 45 days to find a new mate to marry or are punished by being transformed into an animal and released into the woods. The one silver lining in this dark cloud is that each unsuccessful single gets to choose which animal. A lobster is the bizarre choice of our protagonist, an emotionally scarred architect named David, brilliantly played by Colin Farrell with a perennial deer-in-the-headlights expression. Rachel Weisz is the woman with whom he forms a bond in the film's second half when he fatefully falls into a group of rebels who have made it illegal to couple.

Almost universally lauded by critics for being a razor-sharp satire of societal templates examining sexual mores and the desperately sad world of single dating, ""The Lobster"" is also a moving if unconventional love story rooted in the theater of the absurd, a Kafkaesque fable that perfectly combines Swiftian wit with Mozartian elegance as, in the words of one critic, ""it opens (one's) eyes to a new way of storytelling."" It is rare cinematic caviar for both the eyes and the mind of the most discriminating. As to the film's fastidiously luxurious visual style, Lanthimos seems the successor to Stanley Kubrick -- but as if the director of ""A Clockwork Orange"" had mated with a scorpion.

Although it won the Jury Prize at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, many will not like this film. Samuel Beckett would have. I've seen it half a dozen times, each time loving it more. For the discerning few, this will be one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of recent years. For the rest, they can keep waiting for Godot.",1487721600,,2082,5.0318840579710145

The screenplay keeps one engaged right until a relatively slow-to-come end.  Scenes are beautifully shot, telling their own stories simply by how they are framed, shot and edited.  This movie should not be mistaken for a comedy - it is not. Beware:  there are some graphic scenes particularly if one is sensitive to treatment of animals.

The public sees The Lobster, a unique, articulate, meticulously styled satire of cultural norms set in a dystopian future where single people are turned into animals if they can't find a mate: Weird. Sucks. No redeeming qualities. They didn't explain anything. It's an ""art film.""

This Lovecraftian-meets-Lynchian wonder is certainly bleak, but subtly funny in both its mockery of the forced, impersonal nature of contemporary (i.e. online) dating and its subversion of suspense-thriller tropes with stilted, inert dialog, clumsy violence, and a constant, brutal undercutting of the protagonists' journey toward freedom. In the end, we're left uncertain of how to feel about any of what we've seen: there are no heroes to root for, no victories won, only lingering questions about the feasibility of monogamy and the lengths we're willing to go to in order to pursue it.

And I imagine that's the key to the movie's poor rating here: most people watch romantic comedies for an affirmation of their own narrative through lifelong love, a reinforcement of their presumed happy ending, and The Lobster undercuts that experience at every turn. The result is a far grittier, more realistic portrayal of modern romance than most will likely want to stomach. That said, it's certainly a movie I can appreciate for its literary approach, unique stylistic flourishes, and the subversive fun of the whole thing.",1487376000,,1599,5.142307692307693

7482167,4,B0170FTFOY,"The Lobster is not going to be for everyone, something I realized fairly quickly.  It's one of those films that doesn't bother to explain itself too much and forces watchers to go along with what's happening.  This is a love story at its core.  Colin Farrell is wonderful as David, the character we follow as he searches for love with an expiration date.  If he can't find a significant other at the hotel before his time is up he will become the lobster of the title.

The film is constructed in two parts of which I don't want to say too much.  The first half allows viewers to orient to the oddities of the world before the second half questions much of the dystopia the characters inhabit.  The cast is given enough leeway to explore the story in all its oddities and uncomfortable moments of which there are many.  Though motivations are not always clear, the film reflects much of life's own inexplicable and surprising moments.  Be fair warned, the end may not satisfy as it is open-ended and up for much interpretation, but that is entirely fitting with the concepts The Lobster explores.  It is weird and wonderful and charming in all its oddities and I adore paunchy, glasses clad and mustachioed Colin Farrell in this film.",1486857600,,1234,4.6192660550458715

I couldn't get it out of my head for two days. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it is, but there are at least a dozen objectively hilarious moments (absurd dialogue, infantilized discussions/interactions) throughout. The premise is ridiculous  you get turned into an animal if you don't find a romantic partner after 45 days of being single. But those are the rules, and as presented, everybody knows them and acts accordingly. To be single is seen as being sub-human. There are vicious indictments against how our culture values both relationships and solitude. It is amazing what we take in stride.

Even weirder: When something happens to an animal (as far as I've read, there was no real animal cruelty during filming) I felt bad for it, but then got over it by thinking, ""Oh wait, it's just a human. Wait, that's still sad."" There are lots of moments like this, that make you wonder why you think about things the way you do.

I've had three viewings of this movie in five days, and I love it so. It's at times achingly sweet  powerful, ironic love where it's out of place  and also incredibly dark and unsettling in others. Even what we see as true love gives us food for thought: We make compromises and change ourselves to make things fit.

Nope, it's not a popcorn flick. Nope, you shouldn't watch it without wanting something to chew on for awhile. But I'm in love with it, and it's actually more satisfying to say that after having to think about it a while.",1486684800,,1628,4.501694915254237

It's good in the sense of well made and that they did what they set out to do but not in that it is enjoyable. Still,  I'm glad I watched it.  Just a heads up. The dog dies horribly.  It is in a way that is relevant to the characters and plot but damn....I didn't mind the stilted manner of speaking as that was obviously what they were going for but I could see it annoying some people.  It's a smart film and sometimes funny.  When it's disturbing it's in an intellectual way rather than emotionally wrenching, even the aforementioned dog scene.  Normally I can't take films with a whif of genuine darkness, but this is a movie that is more about thinking than feeling and that makes the really depressing bits OK, you are more likely to regard them clinically than with disturbing empathy..

At least Weiner Dog had a pretty decent and interesting story until the very end, which was devastating.  The premise of The Lobster was awful and it was extremely depressing.  It was very dark and what happened to the main character's brother was absolutely unnecessary, both plot-wise and visually.  I didn't understand the ending--was it (possible semi-spoiler) so he could match her in sensations, so he could demonstrate to the ""couples police"" that they were a match, or just that he felt sorry for her and wanted to make her feel better. The only part I liked was the revenge factor on the incredibly cruel leader of the world outside the ""resort"" (I don't remember what those people were called).  I didn't see anything spectacular in the acting--it was quite mundane.  I am probably not very astute about the entire movie, but the bottom line was I hated it.",1485993600,4,944,4.725609756097561

7482390,5,B0170FTFOY,"As I write this review, I'm going to try not to sound like a smug hipster who only watches independent films and drinks gluten-free IPAs brewed by his friends in their houses. Because that is not who I am. My favorite rapper is DMX, Movie 43 is one of my favorite comedies, and I am down for a cold Bud Light anytime. Regardless, I think that if you didn't like this film, it's because you were teathered down by your expectations of a generic mainstream comedy.

The Lobster is funny from start to finish, but not like Sausage Party or Neighbors. It's a very dark, very dry sort of humor that relies a lot on the casual way the characters are taking such an absurd situation. If you don't know what the film is about, that's step one towards deciding whether you will like it or not. If you find the idea of a society where people are turned into animals if they fail at finding love too weird to handle, turn away now. If that idea sounds odd and oddly comical, yet sad and even poetic in its own way, it's worth a shot!

But the biggest thing you need to know before you start on this film is that it is more than a comedy. It's more than a science fiction film. It's more than a romantic drama. It's an intense and brutal satire on conformity and the way we deal with dating and finding love. I don't want to get too deep into it as that would ruin much of the film, but you should be prepared to be puzzled, to have questions, and discuss with the people you watch with.

Ultimately, what I'm trying to say is that this film is kind of like a comedic version of Black Mirror. If that excites you, go for it. If that turns you off, go watch There's Something About Mary again.",1485907200,,1680,4.195046439628483

I hope that clarifies. None of the action is meant to be taken at its face value. You will have to think as you watch (do not watch this if you need something to passively watch to turn off your brain at the end of a bad day).

My interpretation is that the action in this movie reflects modern human societal intolerance of people who are different, people who can't or won't adhere to expectations or normalcy, or who require time to process their emotions, such as grief.

The title character isn't yet a lobster, but that's the animal he picks for his transformation should he be unable to find a mate within the required time after his wife leaves him and he is relegated to the hotel where singles must go to find a mate within 45 days (or be doomed to animal life forever). He is given no time to mourn the loss of wife; her is thrown almost immediately into the hunt for a mate, much way one is exhorted to ""get back on the horse"" by well meaning friends and relatives for whom one's single status is now too threatening.

There are a few stereotypes of dating types, but for the most part they ring true because we've either experienced them ourselves, or we ARE them. The couples engage in mutual delusion in order to fulfill the requirements and not be transformed. Some engage in outright lying coupled with self delusion. And some, when the lying and delusion are revealed, willingly choose to continue deluding themselves rather then face the horror of being single again (because surely having someone -- anyone, even a desperate liar -- is better than having no one!).

And then there are the singles who've liberated themselves from the hotel straightjacket and the future animal transformation despite their failure to find someone. They have their own narrow requirements and impossible expectations -- different from, but every bit as inhumane as, the hotel's requirements. You can see why they react the way they do to escaping the hotel and the forced transformation, but their restrictions on living together as a group and forbidding flirting and sexual relations dehumanize, too -- just from the other end of the spectrum.

In both situations, one is forced to deny one's true self and authentic emotion and character. The possibility of just being yourself doesn't exist either among the single escapees, or the forced couple-hood of the hotel and larger dystopian society.

Among the single escapees we see those people who can't stand to see others coupled and happy, and would deny them that happiness, as fragile and transitory it often is (ah, new love; the bloom comes off all roses eventually). One of the singles has managed to stay defiantly single at the hotel among all the desperate relationship seekers; she's successfully extended her stay in limbo/delayed her forced transformation, but only because she is an utterly odious person; she offers no solution, only an example of how insane and brutal it is to live successfully with no human ties and no loving or sentimentality -- and she also helps illustrate how desperate a single person may be to lie to him/herself and to one's partner in order to fake the realtionship, as well as how devastating the consequences of getting involved with such a heartless person can be to oneself and one's other loved ones such as family or friends.

Friendships are also fragile in this absurd world -- especially the way in which being in the same boat (whether coupled or single) can both generate such inauthentic friendships and destroy them (or try to) when one person's status changes and the other's doesn't.

And yet, amidst this terribly bleak (though blackly funny) and absurd premise and action, once the protagonist is liberated from the dehumanizing and impossible expectations of the hotel, his true self and feelings are able to emerge. . . and a real and beautiful relationship begins. The last half hour of this film is an intertwined allegory of both the lengths some envious or especially committed singles will go to, to destroy love in others, and the desperate lengths to which a lover will go in order to be true to the beloved and the relationship after their beloved inevitably changes (whether by choice, fate, or externally imposed circumstance).

And that last part is perhaps the most poignant and surprisingly romantic; it's the heartfelt intention that breaks your heart (in a good way), not whether he succeeds or fails (which is left open-ended by the film). The last few moments of this film are actually very haunting as you watch him try.

As someone who in the last couple years re-entered the modern dating world after a decade away while I was in a LTR, I can definitely say I saw the allegorical parallels almost immediately. But I think it might be harder to see the allegory if one is in a happy (or just really long) long term relationship -- or if one is very young and has not experienced much in the way of relationships and (as Matt Groening once put it, in a ""Life In Hell"" comic) dating and mating and hating and berating. If you're one of those people, unless you're exceptionally perceptive and observant, these aspects of the film may be quite hard to realize if you haven't been down in the trenches recently, so to speak.

Personally, I will watch this again, because I know I will pick up more on subsequent viewings.",1485388800,,5409,4.754797441364605

The pacing is slow and the dialog is very understated. There is no screaming or yelling. In fact, a lot of dialog is either mumbled, clipped, or inarticulate, in much the way people who are uncomfortable in social situations actually talk. The tension (and morbid humor) is almost subliminal. In some ways, it resembles ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in presenting a dystopian world where some of society's cultural impulses are taken in their logical extreme. But The Lobster is much less heavy-handed in delivering it's message and its characters' sympathies more ambiguous (for the record, I liked the film version of The Handmaid's Tale, but think The Lobster is a more subtle, profound movie. Also, unlike The Handmaid's Tale, it's a comedy, although the humor is so dark and deadpan it's easy to miss.) The overall statements it makes about sex, love, partnership, loneliness, and solitude are profound for those who can hear them.

I almost want to thank the filmmaker for saying these things out loud, and enjoyed some of the awful (and amusing) cinematic metaphors.

Both the pretenders (aren't we all?) who try to fit into society/relationship and are ultimately unhappy versus the rebel loners, who ultimately also are unhappy.  The pretenders even ""raid"" the hotel, which at first seems like an assassination mission - but no - their only goal is to break up couples by sabotaging their relationships.

Do not watch if you are at all sensitive or care about animals -- or humans for that matter.

I feel that the movie was intended to be satirical about the normal societal procession of find a partner, get married, and have kids. Instead, it felt like being subjected to this inelegant sartorial art house film which was stripped of any sort of charming bits and bobs.

It has a Clockwork Orange or Zardoz feel; not sure if that's a good thing.  It's can be uncomfortable to laugh as we watch these characters work through completely dehumanizing stages of existence

Great actors that should hide in shame on this one. Repulsive on so many levels that I can't even describe them.

However, the movie took a left turn somewhere in the middle after a pivotal moment and it never got back on track with the lighthearted mood it had established during the first half, in my humble opinion.

And I'm not talking about the 'if you're single, you get turned into an animal'.  I mean what they did with that set-up.  It just never really went anywhere.  The world seems to be set up into these factions, and I didn't really understand it.  It seemed like it was over-the-top weird just to be like 'lets see if people will call us out on this'.

The actions of the characters and the design of society all seem to revolve around uncovering maximum grimness, rather than any logic or reason. There are some one liners that seem like the film is attempting a wider critique of society as a whole, but again before these ideas are explored or further developed they are tossed aside for what ever will pay off in even more contextless grimness.

Do yourself a favor skip this film. If you want an odd indie darling film that turns the plot of a typical Hollywood film on its ear and delivers some interesting social commentary and contains a pinch of dark humor watch Swiss Army Man.

There is no real plot structure in this film centered around a character you root for.  Instead the viewer watches a series of incidents in which he or she reaches the conclusion that life is politics without hope and endless rules and regulations from which there is no escape.

!! SPOILER ALERT !!!

- Why did the loners have so many rules? They lived in the woods, for goodness sake! And why was breaking the rules so harshly punished?
- Why did heatless girl kill David's dog, who was actually his brother?
- Why is there no security in the Hotel... do the Hotel managers think the guests won't mind being turned into an animal, and will just give no resistance?
- Who is the loner leader? Why is she so important?
- What happened after the loner leader held the Hotel managers at gunpoint?
- What is up with the theme of couples needing to have some defect ""in-common"" in order to be considered a real couple? This is weird, almost robotic. Speaking of robotic, what happened to our human-evolution in this fantasy-future, it seems to have taken a detour to odd-ville? ... There are several scenes where the characters seem to repeat definitions out of Wikipedia, and focus more on being efficient, rather than behaving like actual people. Are these characters secretly some human/robot hybrid? Like Cyborg's? ... That might answer a bunch of questions... if you need help writing a sequel that will fill in the blanks, and make this whole thing make sense, let me know. I'll help.
- It was mentioned at one point ""the animal that no one wants to be"" ... but it was never revealed which animal that was. What animal is it that no one wants to be?
- Who was the lady in the first scene of the film, and who did she shoot? Who was that donkey? ... Is the donkey the animal that no one wants to be?

In summary:
This film succeeded at being odd. But with a better back-story and MANY-more answered questions, this could have been a top notch film. As is, it's ... Ehhhhh, okay.  Seems the script needed lots of work. I'm impressed that they could get this movie made in Europe with such a cast of actors, and such an unfinished script.

There seems to be some obsession to control normal sexual urges or behaviors. Are there population issues? Environmental issues? It is never explained. The common approach to identify a suitable partner based on some physical or personality idiosyncracy is not explained.

After awhile, it becomes impossible to figure out which elements are signal and which are noise.

All movies that were creative, unique and very enjoyable. This movie was neither romantic nor funny. Despite strong performances of the cast, this movie is dreary and boring. The ""concept"" of being turned into an animal for failing to find a suitable mate in the allotted time is an interesting idea, but while the film starts with some clever moments , as when Colin Farrel must choose his animal, it soon devolves into a joyless escape movie and some kind of weird satire about conformity and rebellion, and loyalty. The other residents of the resort are incentivized to hunt down escapees with dart guns for extra time. Rather than a movie about a quirky search for love it becomes another movie about dystopian oppression. The film is oddly violent and disturbing and fantasy premise seems out of sync with the gritty, boring and pointless plot. Skip it.",1484352000,,1193,4.712918660287081
7483042,5,B0170FTFOY,I enjoy movies that are so strange and original without being pretentious. It's disturbingly stark (and sometimes violent) but hilariously funny. I wish there were more of these and less of what's currently being called romantic comedy.,1484352000,,236,5.405405405405405
7483043,2,B0170FTFOY,"This movie had an interesting premise. Find a partner or be turned into an animal. The partner had to have something in common with you, even if just frequent nosebleeds. One man escapes into the woods where runaways are hunted down each day by the singles looking for partners. If they bring them down with a tranquilizer gun to be shipped off and turned immediately into animals they earn an extra day to search for a partner for each capture. In these woods is a comunity of people who have successfully evaded capture. This is where the story gets strange. Instead of being a haven they're run by a woman who doesn't allow any romantic relationships between men and women. Being single is the rule.  Even conversations between people are suspect. Of course our runaway falls in love. They form a sign language to communicate, hoping they won't be noticed. Both he and the woman are nearsighted. The woods leader has a way of slipping into the city where only couple live, so takes the woman he loves and has her blinded. The whole culture, including the woods,  is held by this idea of something in common being necessary so she now feels he can't love her. They escape to the city by overpowering the leader, him leading her.. They have no papers so how they'll be legally able to stay or work to buy food and shelter is unclear. I had hoped they would work this out in the movie's ending, but  controlled by the need for something in common, he asks for a steak knife at a restaurant. The last scene is truely gruesome. He's in the bathroom with the knife out preparing to blind himself.",1484352000,,1593,4.524305555555555

Another reviewer mentioned this was a poor attempt at artsy and I'd have to agree.  I am guessing the awkwardness of the characters was intentional but it was just . . . uncomfortable and . . . BAD.  The concept, however, was intriguing which is why I pressed on to the end.  As for the ending, it was very disappointing.

I didn't understand the whole ""turning into animals"" things, they didn't even really go into it. And there was a part where he joins a colony of single people? It was pretty lame.

Just like the dialogue [which has the wonderful cadence of speech that reminds of True Grit- an equally delightful movie], every moment is served with purpose and little extravagance.  Yet these moments are delicately intriguing and alluring.  The plot is on point AND had me laughing out loud.

If new couples hit roiugh spots some kids are introduced to smooth out the bumps - like kids really solve problems for adults with problematic relationships? Individuals who fail to develop relationship are converted (apparently without memories) to an animal of their choice. To extend time in limbo, the individuals can capture run-away singles. There is a society of runaway singles  living in the woods. Little things like their feeding and care (clothing etc.) are not exactly along for the ride with clear sourcing.

7483155,3,B0170FTFOY,"First off, ""The Lobster"" isn't a comedy except for maybe the most cynical of minds. It is about life devoid of love or any emotion for that matter. As if dancing to silence, the film succeeded in creating an uncomfortable emptiness of human spirit within me. Yet the premise for all of this is based on the shallow platform of a world in which singles (called loners in the movie)  are illegal, hunted down and turned into animals. Set in the context of a quasi sci-fi world that is never really defined, David (Colin Farrell), abandoned by his wife, becomes single and must go to a bizarre hotel and there find a partner within 45 days or he will be turned into an animal, of his choice, of course. (humor here. shall we laugh? It happens David's brother is a dog). It is a vapid world full of nothing more than 'go through the motion' human existence. What kept me interested in watching this film was the great performance of Colin Farrell. He creates a feeling of emptiness within his character. Yet he keeps the character imbued with enough human presence to make me want his character to somehow escape this colorless world. And indeed he and his love do. But with consequences that are in the most empty of ways, quietly appalling.

Why they billed this film as a comedy is anyone's guess. Mine is the promoters saw the movie, freaked out at its impossibly strange premise, and decided they would market it as a comedy for lack of any other ideas that would entice an audience to watch it. Strange indeed.",1484092800,4,1512,4.534798534798535

7483441,5,B0170FTFOY,"I actually enjoyed this movie even more than I expected to.  Weird as anything, but I watched the trailer, so I guessed it would be.  I'd say black comedy set in a modern dystopia is the best way to describe it.  As other similarly-minded reviewers have mentioned, the movie lends a commentary on perception of norms and the humor at work here is subtle and ironic, having more to do with the (to us) bizarre acceptance of ridiculous situations.  To me, it feels a little like the slightly misunderstood brainchild of Philip K Dick, Veronica Roth and Wes Anderson, with the occasional dash of Tarantino - if that sounds like a groovy combination to you too, give this one a try.

It is not even a romantic comedy, as there was no real love, just a bunch of sad people pretending to enjoy others company to prevent themselves from turning into animals. Actions based on the thought process of a nine year old, who probably tortured cats. Almost everyone had no emotions.

7483447,1,B0170FTFOY,"This movie is not a comedy, like the trailer might have you think.

I wanted to like this movie based on the main idea. There are two groups; one punishes their members for not finding a romantic relationship, while the other punishes their members if they do. That idea can be presented in a way more believable than it was in this movie - without all the extra weird stuff added in.

Almost every character in this movie acts either like a robot or completely insane. The characters' dialogue and actions are off, more than could be explained by growing up in a crazy world. Also, be advised there's some animal violence and it's pretty bad at one point.

Finally, the ending is terrible. It doesn't leave you with a question, it leaves you with a hundred questions, and a feeling that nothing was really accomplished.",1483660800,,820,4.602739726027397

I think the premise of the movie is based on the conflict between conformist and non-conformist thus the symbolism of becoming an animal of your choice come to play. Think of the book Animal Farm by George Orwell and you will understand what this movie is about. The acting and scripts are unconventional, and I am certain the director did it intentionally.

Initially this film is a little difficult to grasp. Conceptually, I wouldn't know how to compare it to other films, so in that, I would say it's unique.
Very much of the film is quite grim.  Rachel Weiss is always great, and this was a very different kind of role for Colin Ferrell.
The ending rather stunned me and I was left wondering what the hell had just happened and why!  I won't spoil it for you,

One of those movies you finish going, 'did I like that? It challenged me... but in a good way?'. I'm not sure I would call it a comedy, more like a dark think-piece that will make you snerk a few times. The characters are interesting and the creators did a good job of showing how fearful and dead inside everyone really was. I don't think I would watch it again, not because it wasn't a good movie but because you only need to see some things once. You really have to be quite ok with first 30 seconds of this film to enjoy the rest of it.

7483721,4,B0170FTFOY,"The movie is an absurdist look at relationships and the pressure in our society to be part of a couple; to ""match"" and to need each other. It also examines the constraints that society puts on our relationships and the degree to which we allow this to occur and are active participants in these restrictions. Our main character later becomes part of the ""loners"" and submits again to a whole new set of restrictions. This is much in the same way that once we are no longer single, we are no longer part of our former ""loner"" group. Whether we are a ""loner"" or ""in a relationship"" there are constraints. It is not for everyone. People incapable of abstract thought or introspection will not get it and will just say ""it was weird"". Ultimately, it is weird but it is also very creative, dark and insightful. if you like Kurt Vonnegut, you will probably like it. The humor is very deadpan. Much of the story and why it occurs must be analyzed and interpreted in order to get the meaning and I am sure there are many interpretations which can work. Overall, I liked it. I think my favorite part was when the main character had killed rabbits for his forbidden ""loner"" love interest because it was her ""favorite food"" discovers that others have brought her rabbits and tells her essentially, ""you don't have to accept rabbits from others, I will provide you all you need"". That is a microcosm of the way that it examines relationships through apt, but absurd observations about the way in which we behave in a relationship. ""I thought I was the only one bringing you rabbits"" he says.. I did feel that the initial premise was really good and that there could have been clearer explanations of some events but overall, I liked it. It was a nice departure from the brainless drivel that is produced in bulk by Hollywood. If you are a literate person who likes movies that require thought, check it out.

The opening shot is a woman driving along a 'deserted' country road until she reached a group of horses. She gets out of the car with a handgun and... bye bye horsey.
We then take up the story of the main 'character'. He decides to enter a 'hotel' where people go to, I suppose, meet up with other people (although there are 'couples' there too). They ask him what his 'preferred animal to become is and he says ""a Lobster"", hence film title.

All I really noticed throughout this 'hotel' was the ""Flower Painting"" motif. what 'that' represented is 'anyone's' guess.
We see some people in the 'goodbye' area seeing off a horse which mirrors the 'opening' scene, so I wondered: ""hmmmm.""

the 'Hotel People"" went out hunting with tranquiliser guns for the 'Loners"" that lives in the nearby forest. We never establish who or why the Loners are. And Lobster Man eventually becomes a Loner.

The 'story' just got even 'weirder and weirder' until anything that happens just happens for weirdnessess sake. So if you like 'weird' films you'll really enjoy this slab of dementia incognito. Albeit this isn't an 'Art Film'.",1483315200,,1366,4.829059829059829

2ndly, this is definitely a dark movie filled with strange customs and bizarre uniqueness but the 2nd half of the movie finally gives you an actual movie that you can digest, breakdown, follow and be truly interested in. If you think that animals were actually harmed in this film, you're probably part of the 44% that gave it a 1 star. Please expand your mind and detach yourself from your bias; ironically this is what the movie also expects of you and what the motives in the movie demand of you.

The 1st half is like the introduction to the strange new world that is the future. A few of the scenes will have you cursing, asking is this real, and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

The 2nd half is the actual meat of the movie with a true purpose and something you can even believe in.

Overall, I gave it 5 stars for it's uniqueness, the true fear of how close we can get to this type of dominance and governance in the future and just from pure curiosity of how we got to this point in the future where couples were the end all be all (don't forget this used to be the golden rule in the early 20th century as well).

My boyfriend and I like bizarre TV shows and movies, so the premise sounded delightfully odd. The guy wants to become a lobster if he can't find love? What? Sounds hilarious, right? The result was instead a movie with dark and awkward humor that thought it was a lot smarter and wittier than it actually was. I think I snickered one time during the entire film. It was overall disappointing and difficult to watch through the end. We found ourselves questioning if things were supposed to be jokes or not as they fell flat time and time again. Who decided this was a comedy? Yes, I suppose there could be something to be said about society and the obsession with finding a relationship and turning that into a drama about it being a life or death situation to show the utter absurdity of society's obsession with finding a significant other, but it was executed so utterly horribly that it was neither clever nor funny.

It is the second to worst movie I have ever seen. I continued watching until the end because I hoped that somehow the film makers would wrap things up to salvage this bleak and miserable attempt at an ""art"" film. Doesn't happen. How did Farrel, Weiss and O'Reilly get conned in to making this POS? Afterwards (or during production) did they feel embarrassed? duped? foolish? sickened? double-crossed? Apparently the director instructed most of the actors to deliver their lines in a deadpan, emotionless manner, with many pauses and moments of silence, and the actors trusted that when edited, this acting style would be effective. It was not. Those who thought this was a comedy must be sociopaths. It was an immature and totally off-the-mark failed attempt to make an intelligent, absurd, black comedy, but the production was so amateurish and conceited that it was offensive. Since many of the writers, directors, producers, etc. were Greek, I tried my best to relate the rich history of Greek mythology, philosophy and theater to aspects of the storytelling, but the film was so baseless that all I saw was naval-gazing on their part.

This is not a Seth Rogen style movie so don't go into it expecting a light-hearted quirky bro comedy. This is a dark and sometimes violent comedy that will make you think about how our society pushes us towards certain roles and how even the resistance to those roles is really messed up. Don't believe the negative hype from squeamish people who were looking for something superficial. Give it a try and make up your own mind.

But I started to struggle with some of the utterly brutal violence that was depicted. I think such scenes have a place in film (usually in horror) but it took this movie to far too dark a place for me to be able to enjoy the humor of the other scenes. I did read a summary to find out how it all finished, since the concept was interesting.

Give it a go, if you like the concept - but be aware this is VERY dark satire - human mutilation, animal abuse, the extended sounds of a terminally injured woman screaming as she dies are all to be found here. I think the viewer should know that before they watch.",1483142400,,738,4.153846153846154

7483903,5,B0170FTFOY,This film was charmingly bizarre. It struck me a bit like a more adult dead pan of a Wes Anderson film as far as the dialogue and interaction went.

A complete waste of time",1483142400,,293,4.547169811320755
7483909,2,B0170FTFOY,"I did not enjoy this movie. It has some perks  it's beautifully shot, with every scene painstakingly staged like a photograph; the settings are beautiful and evocative; the costumes and acting is great. For some people, that is sufficient for a movie to be enjoyable, and fans of meandering indie movies may like The Lobster.

I'm no huge action movie fan who needs sex, drugs and violence to enjoy a movie, and I generally prefer rambling indies to major studio blockbusters, but this was too meandering even for me. The movie is set in an alternative universe where single people are condemned to life as an animal. The main character is left by his wife and goes to a sort of hotel for single people, where they have 30 days to find a mate. Though pretty out there, this plot has a lot of potential to explore the way humans connect and the meaning of love in a very different societal context than our own. This movie does not explore that idea. Instead, it throws in a sub-plot where the hotel guests also hunt guests who are out of days (it's not clear how the expired guests get out into the wild, since the animal-transformation happens inside the hotel) in order to gain more time, and a second sub-plot dealing with expired guests who haven't been hunted down living in the woods on the lam. The movie is about 45 minutes longer than I wanted to watch it, but it is still not long enough to explain any one of these plots fully. Sometimes movies that try to explain every single character and relationship can come across as heavy-handed, but this movie took it too far in the opposite direction and came across as under-developed. We don't get good backstory on any of the characters, making them feel one-dimensional and making their choices almost entirely inexplicable. Their interactions are largely flat and devoid of meaning, though the chemistry between Farrell and the eventual love interest is great. Instead, everyone seeking love is looking for a shallow, surface-level connection (""We both wear glasses! Are you nearsighted or farsighted? Me too!"") motivated more by shallow self-interest than any real depth to any of the characters. The end of the film suddenly devolves into sudden goriness, as there are far too many loose and half-formed strings to tie up, with no real emotional build up from the first 100 minutes. Only once scene (between the hotel manager and her partner, showcasing the flaws of this system of matchmaking) has any emotional depth and poignance, but even that is not worth the rest of the movie to see.",1483142400,2,2552,4.745495495495495

The part that bothered me is the idea that couples need to share a defining characteristic in order to be a good match. That whole idea was just bizarre to me and screwed up the story. I can accept the other weird points about everyone needing to be in a relationship or face being turned into an animal.

7483982,2,B0170FTFOY,"Watched this all the way through, waiting for it to have more meaning. I've been watching independent/art/foreign films for 40 years, and can take a lot. But this particular movie just seemed a colossal waste of time, effort and money for everyone involved. I was reminded of when I dated a guy whose father was a well-known Dadaist. We attended a gallery opening, where the walls were lined with crude paintings of palm trees on plain paper. My friend's father had simply copied a line drawing of palm trees over and over, then had his son paint inside the lines. He was selling the paintings for $150 each. As the wealthy art patrons were buying the paintings, they knew they were being ripped off, but liked to believe they were ""in on the joke."" But of course, the joke was on them, as the father, the ""artist,"" sniggered at their stupidity and stuffed their money into his wallet.",1482969600,3,885,4.6075949367088604

Well, this isn't the worst I have ever seen, but then again that other movie was rip-off by a Hong Kong gang using unreleased Jackie Chan fight sequences.  The opening scene looked like a bad acid trip experienced by someone with severe emotional and physical problems.

So, let me be clear...watch The Lobster at your own peril. As much as I like dark humor, I found very little humor or anything else other than utter depravity in this movie.

If you're looking to watch a ""dark comedy"" realize that some movies are darker than others, so you can't be disappointed when it is. On that note, this movie is very dark, slow paced and long but it all ties in to what the movie is trying to say. Don't watch this movie and then hate it because it wasn't what you expected, watch this movie and love it for the point it's making.

Try not to think about what's going on as only a parallel reality and more of a mocking of ours. In all honesty, I hated this movie while watching it but then all my friend had to say was ""it's a satire on society"" then everything clicked! All the scenes are written very well and the entire movie is a joke about relationships and the subtle rules there are. I couldn't see that while I watched it.

7484031,5,B0170FTFOY,"I had a hard time figuring out whether I should give this 4 stars or 5, but I went for 5, rounding up from 4.5.
The half-point off was for the length and kind of meandering threads that could either be tightened up a bit for a feature film, or lengthened into a mini-series or series of sequels and work just as well, as it's really a multi-part story.

The story is deep and full of metaphorical references that are well-languaged at every stage through the poetic dialog.  Kudos to the writers, who must have interesting lives and an open-eyed perception of their relationships.  I feel for their partners, but I am so glad the writers put it all on paper/film/bits for us all to share in such a deep way.  The method of the actors is amazing as well, with a monotone presentation that really fits the genre...and it's so cool to see a fat Colin Ferrell fitting perfectly into his role as a person trying to accept social 'norms' and not succeeding despite his great beauty.  Take note all:  you may be amazing and beautiful and not even realize it due to the stories you tell yourself about what you're supposed to be!!

Great job...this one goes into my favorites folder as one of the films that helps me tell the story of how my life can be larger than it was, and the pitfalls of my preconceptions.  Seems like a superficial message to myself, but this one hit home in a tangible way that validates where I'm at finally...even if I'm not really like any of the film's characters.",1482883200,2,1485,4.4338235294117645

Subcultures prize a harsh singledom and punish those who deviate from their alternative values and find connection.

It did deliver on characteristics of black and dry, in spades.  It was flat, monotone, desolate-- not through fault of the actors, but through the utter depths of nihilism in the script.

And a warning to animal lovers: there are two graphic and gratuitous murders of animals.  In spite of the complete lack of redeeming characters, it seems the director needed to hit you over the head with the fact that life is meaningless and death is brutal and inevitable.",1482624000,4,596,4.584905660377358

7484310,1,B0170FTFOY,"I hated this movie.  The more I think about it the less I like it.  A satire about social pressures to be in couples sounds interesting.  But once the satire is set-up the film has nothing to say.  The punishment for not finding a partner is to be turned into an animal, but why?  The animal transformation has no connection to the central satire, and indeed, the filmmaker never explores that conceit after it's been introduced.  The film is disturbingly violent, again in ways that do nothing to illuminate the satire.  The characters are cruel.  The characters know nothing about love or actual human relationships (the script makes everyone convinced that love blooms merely from finding a person who shares the same personal quirk that you do - a limp, a lisp, a nosebleed, or near-sightedness) so knowing nothing of relationships the characters are incapable of communicating anything important about relationships to the audience.

The bizarre premises were eerily familiar--over human history, and even now, so many of the world's conventions and constraints to do with sexual relations have been brutal and punishingly uncompromising--something most of us viewers wouldn't have experienced or even thought about. Moment to moment, the film's inventiveness kept surprising me; my partner and I found ourselves piecing together the logic that made the elements fit together. Also, the love story that emerges and unfolds (against big odds) toward the end of the film has, in a way, more poignancy, tenderness, and substance than I've seen in film before. I also loved the extremely low-key acting, which can sometimes grab my attention way more than higher ""drama.""

7484418,1,B0170FTFOY,"First off, the pacing in this movie is dreadful.
Without giving too much away, the movie basically pulls a full stop at the half way point and begins again.
This made this 2 hour movie feel like it was 4 hours long.
Additionally, the movie lacks subtlety; it's so desperate to convey it's message that it fully jumps the shark during the movies aforementioned ""second start"".

The humor in the film is predicated on absurdist ""observations"" of society, and most of the jokes fall pretty flat. I'll go ahead and spoil the one funny joke of the film: While discussing the possibility of marital strife in a world where marriage is required, they quip that ""if the fighting gets too bad, we'll just assign you children. That usually helps."" The one genuine smile I got from the film, and it is in the trailer.

It bears repeating (since the film continually insists on doing so) that the message here is pretty plain and obvious, but the film treats the audience like a child and repeats itself constantly.

In summary, I ""get it"" but I don't like it. At all.",1482192000,2,1056,4.576719576719577

7484446,3,B0170FTFOY,"First off, I watched this movie specifically because of Colin Farrell. I love his work and had heard this was a dark comedy worth viewing. While there are humorous bits, the dark side far overwhelms the comedy aspect. You're going to want to get a good nights rest and focus up when you watch this because it requires a quiet room and attention to detail. While the movie itself was good, I would never want to watch it again just because of how emotionless and sad the world they all live in is portrayed. A quick summary without spoilers is that everyone lives in a world where you must be partnered up at all times. Shopping alone would mean a security guard can come up to you and demand to see your marriage papers. Single people are given 45 days in a hotel to find another partner or they are turned into an animal of their choice. People who flee the hotel go and live in the forest but do not allow themselves romantic interactions even there. Its a strange, cold world and while described beautifully is not one I wish to visit again, hence the 3 star rating.

7484450,4,B0170FTFOY,"I've been somewhat puzzled by the characterization of this movie as science fiction. Apart from the theatrical conceit of transforming people into animals, this is nearly pure, and pitch black, satire.  What it chooses to explore about human relationships is an emotional funhouse, with it's observations delivered in a deadpan manner.  If you are single, there are stretches that will make you squirm. If you are in a relationship, there are stretches that will make you squirm.  Are you together because you share the same weaknesses? Are you alone because your defects are singularly your own? Does love really exist, or is it something we convince ourselves exists? Would you mutilate yourself to be with someone?

Once that's realized then one can truly enjoy the interwoven comic brilliance and irony manifested by this film. As one who writes movies for a living, I can see why mainstream audiences (especially for U.S. audiences) whom tend to be compelled for simplistic entertainment, would be less than satisfied. That lack of fulfillment isn't a failure on the film's behalf but rather misdirected expectations of the audience not realizing what they're getting into beforehand.

The last scene of the film is the best one, but I'm not sure the movie earned it.  THE LOBSTER is a merciless satire of relationships, love and totalitarianism, but it didn't seem like it spent enough time really digging into those targets the way it could have.  The great Olivia Colman is in it, but she's largely wasted.  Some viewers may feel like the movie hammers home its themes long past the point where it is necessary.  And there is a level of cruelty in the movie that makes it at times very difficult to watch.

If one looks at the film and tries to take it at face value, you'll surely be disappointed by it's brutally morbid sense of humor and the hyperbole of both companionship and isolation might seem dull and overstated. However, this hyper-realistic comedy is full of dark puns, witty dialogue and an enjoyable look into how modern society attempts to mold people into some false dichotomy. This is present right from the start when Colin Farrell's character can't be bisexual, he must choose between being heterosexual or homosexual, or that his shoe size must be 44 or 45 rather than his prefered 44 1/2. Furthermore, the world is split up into those who are single, ""loners"", and couples and couples are further compartmentalized. If you are one that enjoys cerebral films, or enjoys just extremely well made films, I highly recommend watching ""The Lobster"".

Given only forty five days to partner up or be changed into an animal, Farrell resorts to desperate measures as he nears the deadline. At times the viewer is surprised by the humor/violence that seems to pop up out of nowhere. It's alternately jarring and thought provoking, posing many deep question with no answers.

I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin it and there are plenty of other reviews that spell out the plot.  I will say that Colin Ferril, the formally - almost exclusively - foul mouthed highly limited actor really moves beyond his former bounds.  He does a great job playing the uptight, shy and insecure lead.  He is believable and calls forth our sympathy and maybe some empathy for him.  I felt is isolation, discomfort, pain and love at the appropriate points in the film.
Admittedly, the movie is weird.  It took me a while to figure out if it was to be taken literally or not, what they were getting at, how it worked.  I found it to be an incredibly clever and moving commentary with regard to relationships - those we are supposed to be in, have, cherish and reject.  Clever, subtle, sublime, well acted and delivered.  Note:  This is NOT a comedy.  It is also not a romantic comedy.  It is rather dark.  Humorous moments.

The other audio choice we are given is usually dissonant violins droning on, in case the color palette and imagery weren't clear enough that this is supposed to be a drab affair.

7484850,5,B0170FTFOY,"The most common complaints from the nefarious waddling crowd reveling in their own idiocracy is the fact that this film: (A) Features a controversial scene where a dog is kicked to death, (B) The film was mis-marketed as a mainstream comedy, (C) This movie is graphic in multiple other regards, and (D) (this one isn't explicitly mentioned, but..) The film works to analyze and subvert modern perceptions of the world of relationships and romance through a carefully calculated deconstruction of such concepts using powerful absurdism, deadpan humor, and satire.

This movie doesn't shy away from embracing its own weirdness. The pacing is slow at times, the plot seems to build on a nonsensical foundation at times, and the morbid executions in the acting are sometimes enough to take a blowtorch to the foot at times.

But with all that said, this movie is without question A MASTERPIECE. The film works as a bold execution of its satirical narrative without ever feeling gratuitous. Yes, even with some of the graphic scenes depicted, the entire visual language of the film feels perfectly justified. The plot dynamics are grounded in the satire and, after reflecting on the story more, you can start to see how such a film is informed by the subjective perception on the world of dating. It's analytic without ever feeling cynical and I theorize that, along with point (D) I made about why people hate this movie, this movie also receives resounding hate because it provides criticism for any of the happy relationships or marriages people have formed in maybe the past 5-10 years.

However, if you are of the variety that caters a deep appreciation for the art of satire and absurdism, are not offended by a few visual depictions of graphic violence, and enjoy bold cinematic metaphors play out to think on for much longer after the film has ended, then this film is DEFINITELY FOR YOU.

I found myself still thinking about it the next day and realizing how witty it was. The humor is ""dry"" but still funny. I didn't find myself laughing out loud at any parts but quite a few times I did smirk at the ridiculous situations. It certainly cracks jokes at what is considered the ""norm"" in our society and makes you think. I feel it probably is too smart for its own good and that a lot of people may not appreciate the charm of it. It's worth watching. Would I watch it again? Probably not.

This one doesn't have those other elements, unfortunately.  The acting is stilted, but it's meant to be because the characters are uncomfortable.  The actors probably had to work at being that wooden, given that this is a top cast.  What the film does get right is the idea of absurd pressure to be coupled in society.  In the film's society, it is taken to the utmost extreme.  However, any single person (or unhappily married one) can readily relate to the age old ""You're nobody 'til somebody loves you"" undercurrent.  We see people who are fine with living a solo life but are not left to do so.  In everyday life, we see this in our own society, so the film uses this as a foundation, but it could have capitalize on it a bit more.

7484998,3,B0170FTFOY,"This is a ""what did I just watch?"" type of film filled with dry humor on relationships.

David (Colin Farrell) loses his wife and goes to a rigidly run hotel to meet someone new and hopefully be able to be returned to the city. If he fails, he goes to the Transformation Room and is turned into an animal of his choosing, in his case a lobster. He is there with Bob, a dog who is his brother.  Pairing is done rather oddly. One man gives himself nose bleeds so he can be judged compatible with a woman who suffers from nose bleeds. They pair and don't get turned into animals. Some humans resist  being turned into animals and leave the hotel. They are called runners and are hunted by hotel guests to allot them extra time to pair up.  David experiences life paired up, and then as a runner where he meets Rachel Weisz, a woman he truly loves.  What he does for love will surprise you.

The film rates as an ""oddball"" which I might of found funny watching it with the right crowd instead of alone. It is a frank look at relationships and something that could be studied at film school. It asks the question, ""If you could be any animal...."" While at the same time making us realize no one really wants to be that animal.

Deeper than ""Logan's Run"" but not as blissfully entertaining.

These same idiots will rate junk like most modern trash Sandler films a 5, or let Bay Transformer films make a billion dollars, but then something that requires a little thought and phft forget that. It's a 1.
This movie is fantastic. From the way it's shot (great cinematography as well as where they shot is gorgeous scenery), to the way it's written and performed. Everything is in sync to display a fairy tale in the simplest way possible. If you have a brain that works you can listen to what is going on and realize it's critiquing modern ideals about partnership, and even the way we go about that. The way society sees these rituals and whether or not that is a good thing.
It's a deep film, and may be difficult to wade through given it's reliance on metaphor and bizarre behavior.

7485097,5,B0170FTFOY,"I saw the movie in a movie theater having seen a trailer for it some time earlier. I find it brilliant but it is not a 'romantic comedy'. It is a sardonic commentary on the nature of 'love-relationships' and the near requirement in this face-book/twitter society to be 'paired' to be seen as being normal. I know too many people who, because they are not paired in a relationship, feel abnormal, feel lost cast out etc. This is dark comedy and 'theater of the absurd.' Were some of the facets obvious? I am not sure. A society where there is pressure to be 'paired'. An opposite polarity group where you can be together but no intimacy? A society where you pair with someone has to have the same defining attribute as you? For many who have asked themselves ""what is the grounds for a successful relationship"". How much should we have in common, how much should our value systems differ ---I think this 'taking' of some facets to the extreme is to dramatize the absurdity that sometimes surround social pressures, social conventions, and how it impacts the quest for successful relationships with depth, meaning, change and evolution. I do get how many 'expecting' a romantic comedy would have thumbs down.

7485109,5,B0170FTFOY,"You need to go into this film with an open mind and a strong and/or empty stomach. You might hate it, but I loved it.

I have seen this movie 3 times, and can say that I will most likely watch it again. The film is terrific. Actors and Actresses are top notch, to the point that it is not hard to believe that this dystonia could be real. I remember that after the first viewing, I was amazed by how much the film managed to do and say, for that matter, in only 2 hours. The story is unique. It delivers many messages that I find to be extremely relevant today, but it does so in ways that I have not seen previous to viewing this film. I found myself laughing out loud in the theater. The humor in the film is extremely underplayed, but it is because of this that it is genius. I found the humor very comparable to a Wes Anderson film. The laughs are very subdued and found in the seriousness & sincerity of the dialog.

THAT BEING SAID
This film has such skewed ratings because I don't think you can be adequately prepared for the shock, gore and overall message of the film. The trailer did not prepare me at all. I suppose if you have seen other films by this director, you may have seen at least the dark aspect. I had seen Dogtooth and found it completely disturbing, most likely due to the taboo content in the film, but it too had a very powerful message. I am trying to say that if I had realized that these were by the same director, perhaps I would not have been in shock.

The second time I saw this film, I brought my good friend and her boyfriend. My friend claims to love her boyfriend although I am likely the only person who knows her whole slew of infidelities. Needless to say, they both hated it. I think she realized the truth of the film and chose to be ignorant of it and he, being very clueless, was also turned off by the message of the film. I would not recommend this film if you are stuck on Disney type romances. If you plan to find a prince and live happily ever after, this film will either be a turn off or a rude awakening.

.I am not one for gore and I watched it for the first time a few months after my mother's death. I understand that gore and images of pain and death are hard to tolerate. But this director makes it work. All of the gore, pain and death further the message of the film. It is not purposeless like many action or horror films that use it as a shock factor.

The ending is fantastic. It keeps you thinking long after the credits end and strengthens the message of the film.",1480982400,,2528,4.130081300813008

Also be warned that several forms of physical mutilation are graphically depicted. Including the mutilation of film making.  As nearly as I can tell this lurching, plodding disaster of a film is meant to be a satire on social conventions, especially marriage and in particular the convention that everyone should be part of a couple and the further one that those couples should be married.  In this imagined society under law everyone must be part of a married couple.  Anyone who isn't for whatever reason (death of a spouse for example) has 45 days to find a partner and get married.  This is meant to mock the social pressure towards marriage.  In this imagined society anyone that is single is dragged off to a horrid little resort hotel that is meant to mock all the low end resorts where the staff comes out in the evening to entertain.  In this case the ""entertainment"" being stiff little performances about the joys of married coupledom.  The film tries to make fun (for example) of the idea of compatibility by insisting (for example) that a person with a limp should be partnered with someone that also has a limp.  Ho-ho.  What a jolly conceit. The perceived shallowness of all this meant to be communicated by the actors severely underplaying everything.  As a result the entire cast seems to suffer from blunted affect. The really silly part is that anyone that does not couple up within 45 day gets turned into an animal of their choice (usually a dog but not always).  The protagonist wants to be turned into a lobster, hence the strained title.  The fact that none of this makes  sense is, I assume, meant to be part of the satire.  BTW: Several reviewers have commented on the cinematography.  If you are a fan of dreary this film does dreary very well.

After watching it, I've come to the conclusion that this movie is a really dark Wes Anderson film (not literally). Everything about it, from the visual style to the comedy aspects, reminded me of something he would make if he had an idea for a really dark movie. While I enjoyed it, I can definitely see how the average moviegoer could find this boring or not appealing. There isn't anyone to ""cheer"" for, the comedy isn't anything that's glaring, there's no happy ending and it has the same slow pace throughout.

Hence, in our desperate need for love and friendship, we deform and mutilate ourselves in a futile effort to make ourselves acceptable to others.  The movie incarnates this bleak premise and maintains it consistently, right to the last frame.

The result is a philosophical masterpiece as well as an aesthetic one.  Ideas, images and performances are all in living relation with one another.  The Lobster is integral, in the best sense of the term--the whole illuminates the parts and is in turn illuminated by the.

7485292,2,B0170FTFOY,"Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly together in a film. What could be better. Unfortunately, here are three great actors in a dismal, violent, confusing and often incomprehensible film. Just what is going on here? I vaguely knew the story was about a man who wanted to be a lobster. It turns out people register in a very special hotel and have 45 days to find love or they are turned into the animal of their choice. Thank goodness they have a choice of animals. Most people pick dogs but Farrell's character wants to be a lobster. It was never clear to me if people are required to visit this hotel and under what circumstances.

It seems to be current times or the near future and the world has obviously changed. The world seems to be a police state. Loners are hunted and have to live away from the general public. It is all so bizarre that it makes no sense. A movie that starts with an animal being killed, already has me on edge and more comes. THE LOBSTER is violent and cruel. There is little good in people.

Colin Farrell has gained a few points and has a middle-age spread as some call it. I hope he didn't intentionally gain weight for this film. No need to get into character for this disappointing film. Dialogue is hard to explain as everyone talks in monotone and without expression. They are sort of like toned down zombies trying to function in a strange world. The sad thing is these great actors are intentionally acting like they are in a high school play. I guess it sets the mood.  It only gets more confusing and more violent as Farrell tries to get away from this world. Again, was he at the hotel by choice? The virtues of being a couple and in love are extoled. If you're single, you might start choking at dinner and there is no one to save you. Really? That's what they come up with?

It seems like the world is full animals who might have been your Uncle Frank or cousin Tracey. But were all animals human at some point? Does it make any sense? Was the first animal killed a victim of revenge for something he did as a human?

I watched the extras and was amazed at Farrell and the actors being so excited to work on this film with the wonderful director.

7485324,3,B0170FTFOY,"Why did Oedipus put out his own eyes? What it for love? I don't think so. What is this wiring that most of us have to seek a romantic attachment to another? To become a couple. To form a partnership. One might argue that, since it takes so long for human children to develop, and they need so much from Mom and Dad, that our attraction to partnering up is a natural aspect of our reproductive biology. Pre-wired.  But that doesn't quite explain non-hetero relationships, or partnership that involve intense commitments and mutual admiration, even devotion,  but no sex what so ever. This director goes a very long way to make a point. And yet, it isn't really a point at all, rather, a conundrum. Something about the nature of rules and authority that impose rigid frameworks on our essential natures, and the conflicts that naturally emerge because none of us is a cookie cutter shape, identical, and superficial similarities such as a limp, or a lisp or myopia, isn't really a solid foundation for a lifelong commitment of devotion, and in some cases sacrifice. In the final analysis, all he does is raise questions, warn of the dangers of orthodoxy, advocate for freedom and individual will and show how much true love can be a real folie aux deux. Yes, love can REALLY hurt. But who can live without it?

The film is worth watching, just for the chewy issues he raises. But don't expect to actually enjoy it. It has it's madcap humorous moments, but a lot of it is just simply WTF off the wall?

If you've seen his previous efforts, ""Alps"" and the amazing, Oscar-nominated ""Dogtooth,"" you know what you're in for. Lanthimos specializes in squirm-inducing, mordant humor. Don't be fooled by the fact that the cast is, for the first time, stuffed with A-list Hollywood English-speakers. Thankfully, Yorgos doesn't go Hollywood in his first English-language effort. Instead, all the actors commit themselves 100% to his unique vision and all turn in fantastic performances. I love his films and this one is no exception.

Excellent cast, but I am not sure they were the right ones for this film.  One bright spot was Colin Farrell, he was tremendous, transformed from any role I have ever seen him in.  The animal abuse will turn you off, I am sure many people stopped the film at that point.  I watched this on a 8 hour flight, so I didn't have much else to do, and once I started I wanted to see it to the end.

7485336,4,B0170FTFOY,"If you go on the website for The Lobster, it has a wonderfully clever way of introducing you to the film, as well as what the film is all about. As soon as you enter the site, it will ask you a series of questions that will determine what second-chance animal you should pick if you do not find love. At the end of the brief quiz, you will be given three choices based on your answers. From there, you have to pick one, and thats the animal you have to turn into if you do not find the right mate in forty-five days. From there, you can have a second-chance at love as a dog, cat, fish, flamingo, or whatever. My three animals I ended up with was a bison, gorilla, and horse. Of which one I decided to turn into, that is for you to find out.

This strange consideration of our sex life perfectly sums up everything talked about in the European satirical drama, The Lobster, with a call to revision on how an aristocratic society controls our path to satisfaction with a significant other.

Whats shocking is that this dystopian world does not look far off from where we are now. Considering our high expectations surrounding sexual preference and gender roles, filmmakers in Europe knew that it was time to make a psychodrama like this to depict how our revision of sexual stimulation will change in the next few years.

Within this future, we are put in the shoes of David, a loner abandoned by his wife who has become numb over time to light and noise. In fact, neither he nor anyone else in his life show any hint of feeling at all. A calming narration by a mystery woman tells about how he is left to live in a hospital with restricting rules: he cant keep any of his personal belongings, he must wear one of their identical change of clothes, and within his forty-five day stay there, he must find love with another woman, or be turned into the animal of his choosing. In this case, he chose a lobster for its long lifespan. Whoever the narrator of this story is meant to be, by the films final moments, the cruciality of the voices identity will become clear.

In this unsettling world, change for healthy relationships is initiated as they teach the men that they must be dependent on a lover, and the women are taught how their safety is dependent on a man. The staff even goes as far as punishing secret masturbators with a toaster to the hand. If there are any loners hiding out in the moss-infested woods nearby, they are captured by patients with tranquilizer darts and sent to the well-maintained seaside hospital.

The surreal nature of this motion picture feels complete with a disruptive baroque musical, creating a haunting beat you will never remove from your memory. It evokes the lack of apparent fear, making the peacocks and camels seen wandering the woods feel expectant. The only change of thought the characters ever express is when a brother-turned-dog meets an unfortunate fate, and a girls failed suicide attempt. It turns out though that creating a world without feeling generates all sorts of challenges for even the greatest of cinema artists.

While the characters certainly don't feel much, neither does the audience. A motion picture like this one ought to show master over orchestrating the audience to feel what the characters dont, which The Lobster does not fully succeed at. It gets harder to keep up with everything as well with the second half, when everything becomes practically a different type of movie with new characters and a new setting.

But it doesnt make The Lobster any less brilliant in its call to reconsideration of our own emotions. Director Yorgos Lanthimos makes it plainly clear how animals these days have a healthier concept of romance than we people do, as the turnaround of one man chained by unnecessary rules speaks to us.",1473984000,,3788,4.619613670133729

In this movie single people are encouraged to find someone who has similar flaws (compatibility) within 45 days. If you don't you will get turned into the animal of your choice so that hopefully you will have a better chance of finding a mate as an animal.  Because staying single is just too pitiful. :)  Let me stop you right here.  If you are depressed about being single or the dating world before you, I would not suggest this movie.  If you are single and are not worried about finding a mate, proceed.  Especially if you have a very dry sense of humor.

The selection of mate choices is one of the things that make this movie funny.  Colin Farrell is the every-man character.  He has a ponch, and a bad back.  He tries to put pain cream on his back but his arms are not long enough to reach the right spot on his own.  His friend has a bad leg (caused by a wolf attack) and his other friend has a lisp.  The men get to chose between the nose bleeder, a heartless psychopath, and Debbie desperate.

If you have ever been in the dating world as an adult (over 35+) you will see people you know in this movie. :)  It will either make you laugh or make you cry.  If you are looking for a sweet love story, this is not it.  It is more like this:  http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/settl/2949238

In any case. The Lobster brought Kafka to mind as well as several other films like it. But this is a work of genius really. It doesn't make you feel as though you are the cinema anymore. A surreal exit is just about the only one, one can take.

I guess film makers can correctly assume that the movie going audience is too young to remember who they are stealing from.  I never heard the word ""dystopian"" until about ten years ago and now I can't stop seeing it in descriptions of films.  This film has been characterized as a comedy, a satire, a comedy-drama which may indicate that people aren't sure what to make of it and assume that they didn't get it.  It's the director who didn't get it or rather failed to accomplish whatever he was trying to do.  I suspect that the film is meant to leave you with some kind of feeling created by the atmosphere of the film.  A lot of films succeed in doing that.  If it's a satire, what is it satirizing?  Don't tell me it's societal pressure to find a mate because that really isn't so major an issue that it would suggest satire.

Let me be of assistance to any of you who are about to be talked into watching ""that cute-looking rom-com where the guy will get turned into a lobster if he doesn't fall in love or something."" Friends, allies, hear me: this is not a romantic comedy.

Maybe if I hadn't settled in for a feel-good flick where some people go through a few mildly predictable obstacles and then fall unrealistically head over heels for each other in a short period of time before saying some generically heartwarming things in a tired but comfortable attempt at a new take on the Happy Ending--maybe if I hadn't saddled up for that I might have enjoyed it. Maybe? It's not without merit, of course. The escalating horrors of this tiny slice of simple dystopia surprised me at each turn. So I guess that's something?

I think this comedy may be ahead of it's time or just didn't find it's niche with me personally. I laughed out loud on several parts of this film and I enjoyed the first 2/3's but the third act seemed to drag quite a bit for me. The world building in this film was fun and the characters were decently constructed. The concept is a really great one that I believe will make people think about the constructs of the typical relationship within society, or so I hope. I think this is a clever film. I hope to see more ingenuity out of films that have bigger stars, like this one.

So if you have an open mind about what a movie is, about art, then you might enjoy the original premise and what ""The Lobster"" is attempting to invoke from the viewer.

This work is a dystopian Kafkaesque fantasy that shows the influence of Stanley Kubrick in its cynicism and downbeat view of humanity.  Not to suggest that the film is derivative because this is a wholly personal and visionary work by writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos.  The themes as I see them are that society frowns on loneliness but it's worse if it imposes it upon us and ultimately love is blind.  A challenging film that demands repeat viewings.  Along with ""Birdman"" this may be one of the best films of the decade.  For the record my wife absolutely hated this film.

There is a voice over that narrates the story, and I kept wanting to read a short story or novella version of this as it seemed more appropriate than the movie. Why? Here's the reason: In a dark dystopian movie like this when the characters from the very beginning have already lost their souls and have become dehumanized, they have nothing to lose. Therefore, there is nothing at stake for them, or for us, the viewers. We become disengaged. We're watching a static film about a bunch of robots programmed by their dystopian world. This may work for short skits but not a full-length film.

This longing for a prose version and an aversion I had to watching the grim story unfold on the screen tempted me to give this only 3 stars for two reasons: The unrelenting bleakness is hard to watch, and the 2-hour film would have been more palatable at 90 minutes.

It is very odd and eccentric, and not a movie you would suggest to everyone, so I can understand why some were put off by it. But some reviews that I'm reading I feel are unjustified; they are upset over some scenes of animal abuse/cruelty, which are supposed to be dark and heartbreaking, and want to rate the whole film negatively over it. I guess some people weren't expecting the movie to be as dark as it is.

Moving on from the unfair criticisms, this movie is absolutely amazing. Everything is fantastic here: writing, acting, cinematography, score, and editing work together so well. It is hard to put this movie into a genre really, it is a dark comedy, tragedy, and romance all in one. It serves as an allegory for the way we as people view love and relationships, all the while exploring human nature and our need for companionship.

It collapses, rolls to the ground with its feet ajar sticking into the air.  Hilarious, amirite?
Should've quit right there.  I'd been warned.  But we kept on for another 20 minutes through more deadpan cruelty and increasingly alienated and alienating character and plot ""developments"".

We were not warned about the horrific symbolic? or perhaps real? abuse of animals in this film.

By the way, kicking a young girl in the leg to balance the abuse doesn't make the prior and subsequent acts any more acceptable.  Cowards created this film.

7485541,2,B0170FTFOY,"The writer/s had a good idea starting out.  But it appears as if they didn't begin the project of writing this story with the end in mind.  As the movie progresses it goes from being a clever, dark comedy to a dark uncomfortable statement about an issue the writer/s couldn't exactly put their finger on, so they gave up trying halfway through the script.

After another ninety-or-so minutes the film devolves into a loose, frayed, confusing mess that seems to have no alternative but to end. This ending is not so much an end to a story, as much as it is simply pulling the plug on the story.  As we are waiting for our romantic lead to make an excruciating decision, the film cuts black and rolls the credits, leaving the viewer in a state of puzzled bewilderment.

As far as the performances, there are some clever comedic moments and the acting is excellent, but even these bright spot can't save a movie like this from itself.  I couldn't recommend it to anyone. I personally give it two stars only to see what talented actors can make of characters that exist within a train-wreck of a story.",1471392000,,1098,4.52020202020202
7485542,1,B0170FTFOY,This ranks as one of the most stupid movie of all time. It makes no sense. There is no plot that I could fathom. JUST A COMLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME>,1471392000,2,152,3.78125
7485543,5,B0170FTFOY,"In a dystopian future, single people are arrested and held by authorities at a luxury hotel. There, they must find a matching mate within 45 days, otherwise they are transformed into an animal of their choosing and released into the woods. On paper, this sounds very intriguing, but it also sounds like the plot of a terrible B-movie. Thankfully, it is actually a fantastic romantic comedy that is rich with surrealism, emotion, and even some social commentary. Welcome to the wonderful absurdist world of Yorgos Lanthimos new film, The Lobster.

The Lobster marks the english language debut for the Greek director. Known mostly for his 2010 film, Dogtooth, anyone familiar with Lanthimos filmography would surely know they are in for a surreal experience. Now, one would think the english language debut from this director might  be more restrained. Surprisingly enough however, The Lobster is just as strange as his prior films but in the best possible way. The Lobster is a perfect example of a film that appeals to every emotion and audience including drama, suspense, comedy, romance, science fiction, and even action. With all of those elements present, the film manages to keep a consistent tone and to portray a cohesive message. Not only that, but the films main cast plays a big part in helping bring this story to the screen.

It is kind of incredible that a cast of this merit would sign on to play in a film like this, but clearly they understood what Lanthimos vision for The Lobster would be. Our main character, David, is played excellently by Colin Farrell, probably being his best performance since 2008s In Bruges. It is a very nuanced performance that fits perfectly within the world this film sets up. Rachel Weisz also delivers a great performance. Her character feels the most human in a sea of beautifully strange characters, which helps to provide heart and tenderness to the film. And speaking of beautifully strange characters, The Lobster features outstanding supporting performances from an eclectic group of actors including John C. Reilly, Ben Whishaw, La Seydoux, Olivia Colman and Angeliki Papoulia.

As stated before, the film easily couldve ended up badly in the hands of the wrong writer, thankfully Yorgos Lanthimos and co-writer Efthymis Filippou know how to masterfully blend the insane with a dark reality. They create a world that seems laughable at first, but the deeper one travels within it, one would start to see the disturbing nature of the story. The Lobster is very aware that its plot is absurd and this is evident when watching the film; because it is written with such sharp wit. But within the comedy lies a darkness. Similar to the films of The Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino, there are a handful of scenes in The Lobster that out of context may be found extremely disturbing and even terrifying, but while watching the film, it is hard not to chuckle even at the films darkest moments. The scripts strongest element however, is its excellent use of satire on modern romance and social institution. By satirizing such topics, The Lobster can stand on its own in a plethora of romantic comedies, with ideas that will likely still be relevant in years to come.

The mark of any good director, is to make their presence known in their film; keeping their vision clear and consistent. And above all making a memorable film experience. Yorgos Lanthimos goes above and beyond in all of these areas with The Lobster proving once again he is one of the most innovative storytellers working in the film industry today. While watching The Lobster, one cant help but notice the echoes of Kubrickian satire likened to the films of A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove. It is an extremely well paced film. It truly takes you on a layered journey, so much so that once the screen cuts to black, it feels as if a dimension has closed off, and one is left back in the seat of the theater they were sitting in. The comedic beats are spot on and the emotional scenes are strong as well. No aspect of the film went unnoticed it seems, from the production design to the shot composition to the blocking of the extras, everything feels very precise and particular to Lanthimos vision, which is what makes the film so brilliant and exciting. Not only that, but it looks gorgeous. Lanthimos and his cinematographer, Thimios Bakatakis, constructed some amazing shots using mostly natural light. Each shot serve as a beautiful art piece on its own. And included in all of these shots is some beautiful symbolism that likely cant all be seen in just one view of the film. Lanthimos has proved with The Lobster that he is a creative force to be reckoned with.

Its hard to imagine any other film in 2016 will top this one, for The Lobster is just a beautifully unique film experience. There really isn't anything glaringly wrong with it. Yorgos Lanthimos has constructed a truly original arthouse comedy that will likely entertain and perplex audiences of all ages. Even if one didn't like the film, it would be near impossible to not want to discuss it and dissect its every last moment. The Lobster is a true masterwork in romantic satire, so much so that before the film even ends it feels as if one is witnessing a classic film.",1471392000,5,5266,4.806843267108167
7485544,1,B0170FTFOY,"First off I need to say that I saw the trailer for this movie several months ago when it was about to come out in theaters, they spun it in the trailer as a quirky dark comedy slash love story. It looked so good and it had a unique story line that me and my wife couldn't wait to see it. We were very excited last Sunday when we checked Amazon video and it had been made available to rent instead of just buy. The cast was pretty great, but the story and execution were horrendous. It is filled with senseless violence, animal torture, and suicide attempts gone horribly wrong. The main characters or protaganists suffer more and more injustice throughout the movie making it very frustrating. They do get some revenge but not enough to right the wrongs. Most of the characters are sick and twisted. The movie is the most depressing one I have ever seen and I understand that is what the movie makers were going for, but it was just too much and it conveyed such hopelessness that if you are depressed yourself or even slightly suicidal you may slit your wrists after watching this crap. And to top it all off when you think there may be some kind of payoff and explanation to this whole twisted thing you have been watching for the last hour and a half, surprise there is nothing, the movie has no ending, that's right nada. It leaves you hanging and just ends in the middle of an important scene. Why someone would write something so depressing and violent and vile making the viewers sick and depressed in turn is beyond me and frankly negligent. I am also very dissapointed with the respected cast members for agreeing to make this disturbing trash after they must have read the script. I am all for artistic indie movies, but with all the horror in the world I expect most moviemakers would want to make their viewers feel good after watching their work, not leave feeling worse about themselves and the world around them.",1471305600,3,1927,4.492877492877493

Sadly.
A majority of the crowd could barely watch the last 2mins or so... I was not the only person squirming and turning and looking through my fingers...
So... The acting was good as was the film's premise. Execution of the idea... lacked. It somehow fell flat. Or missed whatever point it was trying to make. At least for me. Because of that failure, the whole movie became sort of pointless and a build to nothing.

I envisioned scenes of  the protagonist, imagining himself as a lobster,  as his time to find true love grew shorter and shorter. Maybe humorous dream sequences of what his life as a lobster might be like; and for the ending, perhaps him, giving up his life to save the woman he loves by becoming dinner to save her from starvation, because they marooned on a deserted island, or something. What greater love, eh?  Maybe she even dines on him with her new boyfriend? But no, there was none of that. Very interesting premise that was never fully realized. They mentioned the lobster once at the beginning, alluded to it once in the movie, and that was it.

There are scenes where the theater and I laughed out loud, others where we all cringed. It's incredibly thought-provoking. As a person with a hobby of creative writing, I found the creation of this crazy universe and characters to be compelling. When I first left the theater, I felt perplexed and a bit mad. Later I realized it was simply because I was challenged.

And 2) the lengths people are willing to go to get into a relationship...otherwise society turns you into an animal. What would you be willing to fake? What about a complete lack of emotion? Or hurting yourself EVERY DAY? LOL!! And 3) what would you be willing to do to stay with the one you love? And best of all...what animal do you want to be turned into if you can't find a life partner in 45 days? I would go chimp. Lobsters don't mate for life not matter what they said on FRIENDS.

7485621,1,B0170FTFOY,"Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth, Alps) from a screenplay by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou (Dogtooth, Alps), The Lobster is the film equivalent of a menu entree that sounded good in the description but when brought to the table proves to be an acquired taste at best but otherwise is simply inedible. It's like someone set out to do a parody of art-house films but things went horribly, horribly wrong.  The Lobster has been much hailed by critics and film festivals as a ""comedy"", usually with a prefacing qualifying word like ""dark"" or ""surreal"" or ""absurdist"" and the like.  It actually won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year. But people usually laugh during a comedy.  When my wife and I saw The Lobster, no one in the theater was laughing at any point during its entire 119 minute run-time. Not one person.  Not ever.

The premise, when read, actually sounded interesting:  in a near future society, everyone is required to be married/partnered with a someone of the gender and orientation appropriate for them.  Individuals who lose their partner for any reason - death, divorce, whatever - have 45 days in which they must find a new partner who meets certain conditions of compatibility.  If at the end of the 45 days they have failed to find a new partner, they are turned into an animal of their choice.

The actual film, however, is something else altogether. It starts out strangely surreal - a woman drives to a field where a couple of donkeys are grazing, gets out of the car, shoots one of the donkeys dead, then just gets back in the car and drives off - and then just gets stranger and more surreal from that point on, with no attempt to refer back to that opening scene or show what it was about. A man named David (Colin Farrell) learns that his wife is leaving him for another man. He is then picked up and escorted to a remote hotel where all of the guests are single and are required to find new partners within 45 days or be turned into an animal of their choosing. David is accompanied by a dog, which is actually his brother who also ended up single but did not find a partner within the time limit and was then turned into a dog. When asked what his animal of choice will be, David picks a lobster for reasons that you quickly come to not care about. The hotel, we quickly learn, has a lot of rules the guests are required to abide by:  self masturbation is forbidden (the punishment involves hands pressed in a waffle iron) but submitting to sexual stimulation (without actual intercourse) by the hotel maid is mandatory, as is attending presentations where the advantages of partnership are laid out in the stiffest and most passionless and emotionless ways imaginable. Loners who have not yet found a partner tend to wander in the woods around the hotel, and guests are encouraged to participate in hunts of loners which can buy them additional days for their own deadlines. Partners are required to have compatible flaws or defects, i.e. if you for example have an eye missing then your new partner must also have an eye missing.  And it just keeps going on like that, except that the description I just gave is more interesting and makes more sense than what you see in the actual film, because the actors are required to say and do everything in the most stiff and awkward ways possible.

I felt particularly sorry for the actors as there were a number of good actors in The Lobster:  Golden Globe winner Colin Farrell (Saving Mr. Banks, In Bruges), Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardner), Jessica Baren (Penny Dreadful), Olivia Colman (Hyde Park on Hudson), Ashley Bensen (Ugly Betty), Screen Actors Guild Award winner John C. Reilly (Chicago), L&eacute;a Seydoux (The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Ben Whishaw (The Hollow Crown). But even that vast assemblage of talent couldn't make the characters they were called upon to play sympathetic. Again, on paper the ideas behind these characters could be interesting. The reality of these characters is that none of them are people you'd want to spend more than five minutes with, let alone two hours. In point of fact the only truly sympathetic character in the film was the dog, who SPOILER! ends up getting kicked to death.  It's worth noting - in an equally surreal way - that Bob the Dog won the Cannes Palm Dog award for his role in the film.

I was tempted to give this film two stars for the ideas behind the plot, but I just can't bring myself to do anything that would make people want to see this movie, so one star is all it gets.  Not recommended for anyone unless you have two hours of your life which you wish to throw away with no hope of ever getting them back.",1470614400,38,4679,4.599039615846339

We had to stop watching half way through, I then read the rest of the plot line on the internet and am very glad we did, as the theme of violence continued.

I know we are on the sensitive side compared to the general public, so I do not expect this to be a popular review, however, if you are sensitive to violence, be warned. Personally, I found that it ruined a perfectly comedic movie.  I find this part of the human psyche especially disturbing and am perplexed that people garner entertainment from watching it. Is it not time we evolve?",1470268800,,886,4.396341463414634
7485655,3,B0170FTFOY,"`The LOBSTER is a fable, a form of cinema I enjoy. The promise of the film isn't matched by the film's execution. Although the movie is marketed as a comedy, perhaps a romantic comedy, its anything but. The premise is simple. In some parallel universe, all adults must be coupled. Even a few days after the death of a spouse, you must go to a resort, where you have 45 days to find a mate. This mate must have in common with you, your defining characteristic, like a nice smile, a nose bleed, or myopia. Some people fake their commonalty, and are transformed into an animal that no one will love. The whole point of being transformed, if you don't find a mate, is at least you'll have the possibility of being loved as a pet. Those who don't respond to the resort, are runners, who live in the woods single, although they are loosely grouped for protection. The resort guests often hunt the single people in the wood with tranquilizer darts. When they're knocked out, they're brought back to the resort, and transformed into animals. Several transformed humans live in the woods with the runners, such as camels, pigs, flamingoes, and other odd creatures.

There you have it. Within that symbolic stew, the central story is cooked up between Colin Farrell, and Weisz. Somehow, in the midst of the avant guarde classical music soundtrack, the dry unemotional delivery, and people faking their ""defining characteristics"" just to have a mate at any cost, the movie becomes bogged down . Watching an entire film, where everybody is either acting psychopathic, emotionally distant or with complicated symbolic gestures instead of words, is taxing. Although we should root for Colin Farrell, somehow we can't. Nobody in the film has the courage to be genuine, or to care. The people always dress the same, in business suits, with little variety. Their discomfort with themselves, becomes ours. If the film has a message, its that there is no love, neither with the couples matched at the resort, in normal society, or in the woods with the runners. Its one of the most bleak, stilted, and passionless worlds imaginable. The realism of the characters is constantly sacrificed for the sake of the overarching fable. Even when Farrell and Weisz want to communicate, they do so with complicated hand signals. Along with this, the film is narrated by Weisz from her diary, adding to the distance thru her deadpan delivery.

The entire effect of the movie is one of emptiness, despair, where people dig their own graves, at best hoping someone will throw dirt on their faces when they die, so the wolves don't eat them.. Since nothing in the film, is even remotely human in emotional content, it makes for a very intellectual experience, but not much else. Apparently the Lobster, being a cold blooded sea creature, that people don't love but eat, is how the director wants us to view Farrell. And thru Farrell, the human condition. Everybody is alone, and at best will fake common ground to produce a relationship based on lies. Compassion or love of any kind is unknown. How in the world is that a comedy? Even the ending is tragic. The best fables, will reveal hidden layers of the human condition. The surreal content should reinforce the premise that underlines the fable. Even as a fable, the film just doesn't work, since the childlike simplicity of the fable is missing. That dry, analytical, emotionally flat behavior of everybody, where everything is more of a ritual than an action, breaks apart our connections to the characters. How much truth is there, in seeing the world like that? Love doesn't exist. Only depressed, cold hearted narcissistic people, no more individual than a Lobster.",1470268800,118,3690,4.8462757527733755
7485656,5,B0170FTFOY,"At first glance, The Lobster is an incomprehensible and bizarre film, but it really isn't all that difficult to decipher.  Its a social commentary on the role of relationships in our society.  Even in this day and age, people are more accepting of those who are in a partnership, even if that relationship is superficial and dysfunctional.  Many have children, believing that bringing another person into the equation will suddenly fix all their problems, or at least add a much-needed buffer.
Loners are viewed with suspicion and distrust, and are often left out of social gatherings to avoid awkwardness, which is not to say that they are any more enlightened or better adjusted than people in relationships.  Many people who are alone are threatened by the idea that one of their friends might pair off, and will go to any length to sabotage a relationship for their own ends.  A pretty extreme example of this is shown in The Lobster with the leader of the Loners literally crippling one of her flock to prevent her from finding happiness.
All in all, maybe being turned into a lobster is not such a terrible option.  They don't have as many hang-ups or spend as much time deluding themselves.",1470268800,,1197,4.786407766990291

7485665,5,B0170FTFOY,"I'm going to try and explain why the reviews look the way they do about ""The Lobster"", so sit tight and maybe it'll help you decide for yourself.
The Lobster is a unique movie. Now that can go either way for you, but for me it went towards brilliant and held on tight.

First, let me explain that when I saw this I didn't know it was a comedy. I was expecting a RomCom or a Romantic drama. At no point was I expecting to laugh. But then came the first big monologue of the film, and suddenly I was shaking with laughter... In a deadly silent theater.
""Was I wrong?"" I wondered to myself. ""Should I not be laughing at this?""
It didn't matter. The laughter continued, and kept going through the film.
The reason I was in a fit of hysterics when the rest of the theater sat silent?
This film is DRY. If you added salt to a desert and over-cooked it in an oven it might come close to being as dry as this film.
The absurdity doesn't come from physical humor, or from zany one liners. It is subtle, and, apparently, very easy to miss. It comes from the absolute absurdity of the situation, and the nonchalant reaction the players have to said situation.
Remember he is going to get turned into a lobster if he doesn't find love. A ridiculous premise, that everyone is absolutely on board with. Speaking of which everyone in this film is a bad person. In different ways, and to different degrees, but if you wanted a shiny hero and virtuous damsel. Look elsewhere. The only good people in this film are the animals.

Additionally, this film is dark. There are some really messed up things you'll see in this film. Animal abuse (it's fake, but still.) Don't worry though! There is violence towards humans as well! (I know you don't care as much about that as the animals, but all the cards are on the table now)
In this world animals are treated just as well as humans, because most of them are, or once were human. So if you can't stomach touches of darkness, this won't be for you. If you can, then it should go without saying that these moments frame the beautiful moments in the film.

As I said above this movie had me shaking with laughter, but it's an acquired taste. If you like dry humor, dark premises, and laughing at the sheer absurdity of things. Definitely give this movie a try! If not... Well that's ok too! You might want to avoid this though.

TLDR; it's a black as night, dry as the sun, comedy that holds no punches, and has the opportunity to leave you either in stitches from laughter, or stitches from the fall after you jump out the window to escape.",1470096000,652,2567,4.341666666666667
7485666,3,B0170FTFOY,"The Lobster stars Colin Farrell as David, who lives in a society in which single people by law have 45 days to find true love or be turned into an animal of their choice. David searches for a new partner and after numerous romantic misadventures joins a rebel faction known as The Loners  a group founded on a total rejection of romance. There, David meets a stranger (Rachel Weisz) who stirs up strong feelings within him.

Director Yorgos Lanthimos has created a film in which realism is beside the point. The Lobster is clever, with a surreal point of view and an unwillingness to conform to the conventions of cinematic storytelling. Though it has elements of a romantic comedy, The Lobster is far more, challenging the viewer at nearly every turn in this tale of repression and isolation. At one point, David stays at a hotel while trying to find a partner. Run by a terrifying proprietor (Olivia Colman), the hotel is a halfway house to finding a mate but appears like a concentration camp with fine linens and other creature comforts.

Other hotel guests who must find mates or be turned into animals include the Lisping Man (John C. Reilly), the Limping Man (Ben Whishaw), and the Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia). The theme of why we chose our mates is raised satirically, with the Limping Man convinced he must find a partner who limps, and David, who is nearsighted, falling for a woman with the same visual impairment.

Laced with black humor, The Lobster is set in a fictional world that is extremely detailed and logically conceived. It skewers modern relationships, suggesting that mating is the priority, not love. The idea of being transformed into an animal as punishment for remaining single is both weirdly amusing and bleak.

Speed dating is not what's really happening at this semi-luxe Northern seaside singles resort. So, weary singleton traveller, unless you enjoy punishment that is not about pleasure, you should definitely pick the Carribean option on your brochure this year.

Outrageous story, brilliant acting, breath-taking cinematography and setting, it's all here. Go ahead and surrender to the strangeness. Just pay attention at target practice.

LOBSTER is an ultra bizarro masterpiece that feels like a field trip gone wrong, dragging you deep into strange tribal rites and --refreshingly-- new territory between speculative fiction and scifi...with a key element of magical realism and strange violence that was, for me, once I surrendered to the glacial pacing, altogether immersive.

For the first 15 minutes, I guess I just couldn't believe I was watching a feature film this complex, this smart. Though it also manages to have a minimalist feel that's low tech/  no tech.

A pinch of LORD OF THE FLIES plus a pixel of PAN'S LABYRINTH and a whiff of some unnameable mashup of BBC and grindhouse set in a Black Sea Resort, with generous yacht options.

All that's really something. And all that's why, despite it's senseless length [why I give it 4 stars], LOBSTER is worth it if you are brave enough to commit to a film that takes geological time to build to a highbrow parody of most everything western culture holds most sacred, and then tries to slit your throat, one nicking shock at a time, with a gold hotel pass card.

What are you most afraid of taking a deeper look at? It'll probably sneak up on you here, like the camel in the middle of dense northern woods, along with genius, about-face absolutely Oscar-worthy [and weirdly understated] performances by Colin Farrell [IN BRUGES, HOUSE AT THE END OF THE WORLD, HORRIBLE BOSSES] and Rachel Weicz [CONSTANT GARDENER, THE FOUNTAIN, THE MUMMY], Colm Meany [STAR TREK, LAYERCAKE] and that amazing milkmaid-with-an-uzi, Mia Wasikowska [SPECTRE, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE].

LOBSTER is one of those impeccably made euro-style high concept art films that are really not for everybody. A once-a-decade standout that, like ANIMAL FARM and LORD OF THE FLIES, looks like one thing and is really showing you something completely different. And, into the nutty bargain, quietly manages to call into question nearly everything you know.

Because of the extraordinary acting, writing, and direction, this is one film that definitely because of its quality DNA could have been condensed, 30 minutes shorter; and at that length, it truly might have had a chance with more of the audiences that probably could benefit hugely from LOBSTER's challenging, back-handed send up of social control vs freedom, singlehood vs relationships, survivalist experiments vs CCTV urbanscapes, and the many price points between love and sacrifice.",1469577600,3,2887,5.204741379310345

7485707,3,B0170FTFOY,"I honestly have no idea why I watched past the first three minutes of the film, which showed a woman senselessly shooting a burro. But I paid to see it, so I wanted to at least, get my money's worth. There was enough going on to keep me engaged, however bizarre it all seemed.

The film basically demonstrates how dysfunctional society becomes, and how the most basic instincts, such as love and affection, takes no precedence in a relationship. As long as there is something two people have in common, that's all that's needed for affection to take place. But honesty and trust mean absolutely nothing, because these common traits can be faked. Once the couple lose that sliver of a connection, all bets are off. What a bizarre way to build a relationship! How sterile and boring!

Colin Farrell's character admits himself into a hotel that focuses on building these bizarre relationships, but if a bond isn't created, and a pairing isn't made within a certain number of days, he would be turned into an animal of his choice. (A lobster.) The premise is quite engaging, and did hold my attention throughout the film, but this is DEFINITELY not a movie for everyone. There's animal cruelty involved (which I hated), and weird sexual 'rituals' (for want of a better word), that seemed quite bizarre. (Remember, love and affection mean nothing in a relationship, so compatibility isn't necessary, as long as a couple finds that ""one thing"" in common. For one pairing, it was spontaneous nosebleeds. For Colin Farrel's and Rachel Weiss's characters it was near-sightedness.) And these couples will go to the utmost EXTREMES to make certain that that ""one thing"" remains intact. (As seen at the end of the film.)

Is that true love? No. Obviously not. But again, this film focuses on a dysfunctional society where love no longer matters. It's basically a dystopian utopia.

Unfortunately, for me, this was one of those ""insert-your-own-ending-here"" type of movies that I normally loathe. And while I do not enjoy that type of closure in a movie I honestly can't imagine the storyline going any further than what was given to us at the end of the film--so it actually WORKS. Much to my surprise.

Again, this film is DEFINITELY not for everyone, and is ABSOLUTELY not family-friendly. But if you're looking for a UNIQUE storyline, which will keep you thinking long after the credits roll, give it a shot. I'm not saying that you'll be swept away by its charm. But it's certainly thought-provoking and engaging--in a very bizarre way.

7485711,4,B0170FTFOY,"First, we should acknowledge that not every shade of dark comedy will be appreciated at the multiplex. Some obviously found no humor in The Lobster, apparently because they deemed it too dark; perhaps&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Right/dp/B01DOQ6PBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Right</a>&nbsp;is their idea of black comedy (Mr. Right is my idea of humorless, worthless garbage). But focusing on humor is a red herring, and here's why: The Lobster requires intense thought on the part of the audience, and this is simply too much to ask of multiplex goers these days.

Admittedly, I didn't get through it the first time, late at night. I have stacks of unwatched discs at home, so my attention span is compromised by options requiring less effort when not in the mood to put a ton of brainpower into keeping up with what a movie like this is trying to pull off. Who wants to think when there is so much mindless entertainment available? Then today I found The Lobster playing at the cinema a couple blocks from my condo, so couldn't resist giving it an honest attempt as a captive in front of a projector (at last, my undivided attention). Watching on the big rather than the small screen was helpful, despite a lack of special effects or even remarkable cinematography from Yorgos Lanthimos.

Apparently it's not clear to some viewers within the first half-hour that The Lobster is a brutal critique of *our* cultures rather than a Kafkaesque world unrelated to ours. Specifically, it focuses on the immense pressure society places on the individual to pair up with a partner, and also on sham definitions of love. Obliviousness *in part* accounts for the many viewers who completely hate The Lobster, while the rest of the 1-star raters probably do ""get it"" and feel a nagging sense of discomfort or even offense.

Watch this movie through the lens of metaphor, because The Lobster is certifiably overflowing with them (some blatant, others nuanced) stacked one atop another; it's overwhelming to the point of mental exhaustion. Yet it's also worth the effort. The thespians are the opposite of no-name actors, yielding no reasonable grounds to complain about that aspect of the production; lines being delivered deadpan doesn't indicate a lack of talent. Of particular interest for fellas like me: the Parisienne star La Seydoux (as the femme fatale ""Loner Leader""), and the equally striking Greek goddess Ariane Labed, who played the fated French maid.

I have only two things to say to those complaining about ""animal abuse"" in The Lobster: [1] The donkey in the opening scene was not shot to death, it was anesthetized for the scene; [2] Did you eat a pig, cow, or chicken today? Yes the dead dog scene looked gruesome, but if you are perfectly content to let slaughterhouse workers non-fictionally do that to other animals for you, then perhaps you should simmer down with the accusations.

Anyway, you should give it a try if you can tolerate what is not expected, can think outside the box, and can spare the brainpower.",1467331200,6,3080,5.07905138339921

The film takes place in an alternate reality where being single after a certain age is seen as very bad. If you are one of the unfortunate ones that fall in this group, the government whisks you away to a posh hotel, where you are given 45 days to find someone to couple with, or you are turned into an animal of your choice, released into the wild, and hunted and killed just like any other animal. Our main character is a Man who has recently become single after the appointed age, and is immediately taken to this hotel. There he tries to mingle and make friends, but first names are never used, people are known by some characteristic, ""The Limping Man"" ""The Woman who likes Biscuits"" etc. When they speak ""to"" one another, it is normal a bland list of facts about themselves, or irrelevant, uninteresting trivia. They don't talk ""to"" so much as they talk ""at"" each other, there is no warmth, no connection. it feels forced because it is forced. One other reviewer said ""nobody talks like that in real life"" I disagree, Sometime, just really listen to a couple of coworkers talk, pay attention to things like inflections, sign up for an online dating site and see how the conversation ebbs and flows (spoiler: it usually doesn't) That is what this movie is spoofing, that is where the comedy is, the joke is our shallow, vapid, unrealistic expectation driven world of modern dating. where people get hung up on meaningless details in potential mates (Beards, Boobs and Tattoo's) It also satirizes we as a society who look at older single people and automatically assume there's something wrong with them. If you've ever been single and tried online dating in the last 2-3 years, you will love this film. If you are married, were the popular one in high school or are considered above average looking, dislike cinema that doesn't feed you the explanations on a spoon, give this film a pass, you'll hate it.",1466380800,6,2023,4.635097493036212

7485716,5,B0170FTFOY,"The Lobster features a bizarre dystopian world where being single is banned. The police are constantly vigilant in seeking single people to send to the hotel to be rehabilitated back into a relationship. given 45 days to fall in love or they will be turned into the animal of their choice. They have the opportunity to extend their stay by tranquilizing renegade loners on the run and bringing them back to the hotel. The rules are specific and the punishment for not following them proves to be surprisingly brutal. Some rules require attendance at awkward dances and viewing of pro-couple propaganda skits, showing how life as a single person is awful. Other rules ramp up the sexual desire without release to torture the residents into getting into a relationship. The only consequence we see for an infraction is when a man is forced to put his hand in a toaster and hold it there. It's only the beginning of the unexpectedly horrific aspects of the film.

Enter David. He arrives at the hotel with his brother, who went through the same program and was turned into a dog. After a while, he decides to lie as much as required to get an appropriate mate and leave, but it doesn't turn out exactly as he expected. I didn't like David through the first half of the movie because he was a sad sack person and didn't help a woman who literally told him she was going to commit suicide if she didn't find someone. He didn't have to date her, but maybe tell someone about it before it was too late. Everyone in the film finds one thing to have in common with their partner even if it's imagined. The idea that people can have different interests or more profound connections than being near-sighted or getting nosebleeds frequently is unheard of. I understand the lying because who wants to be turned into an animal? However, he really chose the wrong person. This woman is heartless and makes no apologies for it. She cleverly games the system by being the best at tranquilizing singles and keeps adding days to her stay. He pretends to be just as heartless, but regrets it when she commits a horrific and violent act to test his heartlessness.

When their relationship ends, David flees to the loners in the woods. Although they are on the outskirts of society and live in the wild, they also have their strict rules that have severe consequences. We only see the consequence of one relatively minor infraction and it's not pretty. Like the hotel, the loners have their required uniform. Unlike them, loners can stay as long as they want, take part in solitary activities, and dig their own grave since no else will do it for them. Their main rule is to never fall in love, but of course David falls in love with a woman who is also short-sighted. They build a relationship of adorable wordless communication in an effort to keep their relationship from the others. Both factions are incredibly toxic by setting rigid rules and take away choice from their members.

The Lobster is a hilarious black comedy that has some sharp things to say about our couple obsessed world. I laughed out loud many times, but the film turns a sharp corner into the very uncomfortable and disturbing a few times. It even borders into horror territory at times, especially a particularly tense scene at the very end of the film. The earnest way and flat way everyone speaks is the cherry on top of the absurdist sundae. The film adeptly changes tone when needed. The humor doesn't in any way lesson the horror.",1466294400,4,3489,4.642394822006472

7485721,3,B0170FTFOY,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  Im one of those whos always looking for something a little different and when this Irish indi-film showed up at a nearby multiplex I decided to take a look.  Reviews have been favorable and it has a terrific cast.  I will admit to not being knowledgeable of director/writer Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth), so this was a bit of a flyer.

Sometime in the near future (I say this because there is nothing futuristic about the cars) or perhaps in an alternate universe, it is unacceptable to be single.  If you are unmarried by a certain age or lose a spouse to death or divorce, its time to hook up again.  But the government will help.  Singles are sent to a hotel run by The Manager (Olivia Colman, so good in TVs The Night Manager).  Incoming singles on this first day include David (a pudgy Colin Farrell, Dead Man Down) and a handful of others.

So heres the deal.  You have 45 days to find your soul mate amongst the inmatesI mean guests.  If that doesnt work out you will be transformed into the animal of your choice and sent into the woods.  If you want to be a lobster, as does David, of course you get the ocean to live out your days.  Now as an animal you can also be hunted (killers are rewarded with more days).  Yikes!  One of the things that amused me about this movie is that the characters speak and act like children.  I don't know if that was the intent, but anything complicated that comes out of their mouths seems like something learned from a textbook.

David finds friendship with Limping Man (Ben Whishaw, Spectre) and Lisping Man (John C. Reilly, Life After Beth) but they both find loveor maybe not.  David figures he found his mate in Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia, Dogtooth) but changes his mind after she kills his brotherthe dog.  David decides to make a run for it deep into the woods and finds some security with a clandestine group headed by Lone Leader (Lea Seydoux, Blue Is the Warmest Color).  They have rules too and one is no romantic relationships between the followers.  That becomes difficult when David seems to find his true love in Short Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz, The Bourne Legacy).

Again, their childish way of speaking and acting is a bit distracting.  The films final act brings the film to a crashing thud and left me wondering, Is that all there is?  Original?  Yes.  Entertaining? No.",1465084800,9,2380,4.578199052132701
7485722,5,B0170FTFOY,"I saw ""The Lobster"" when it first came out in the theatres in Washington, DC. This is not a comedy. It is not a fantasy and It is not about sex. I have not seen a more profound indictment of Fascism and Hedonism since ""Animal Farm"". This is an intensely sad, emotional and angry film. The Lobster is merely a metaphor, as it could have been a peacock or a wolf or a termite. The layers of metaphors and indictments of fascist behavior, inhumanity, lost meaning in love and marriage, dead interpersonal communication and a very sarcastic take on the Cowboys and Indians theme. Imagine ""The Prisoner"" and ""Animal Farm"" as done by a Greek Director. The performances were all stellar. This is Colin Farrell's finest performance to date. Rachel Weisz was incredible. The palpable feeling of loneliness, anger, frustration, injustice and lack of identity begins from the first frame. Do not see this film if you are in happy mood; it will not help. If this is Director Yorgos Lanthimos' prediction for the future of mankind, then maybe we should all be lobsters, as the joke in the end, if there is one, is on us. Watch this film as if it was the last day of your life and ask yourself, what would you do the night before. A masterpiece, a work of art, and a brilliant, but very sad, commentary on where love has gone and has not returned.",1464998400,5,1333,4.512396694214876
7485723,1,B0170FTFOY,"I do Not understand how people can call this any type of comedy--dark or otherwise.
I was looking forward to this film. It was billed as ""surreal"" & ""theatre of the absurd.""
I enjoyed Beckett & Ionesco in high school & college, so thought this movie would be along those lines. Wrong. Nothing intellectual in this film at all.
SPOILERS

The film opens with a woman shooting a burro. I kept watching, thinking that since the trailer showed something about people being turned into animals, perhaps the  burro would be revived as a human being. Never happened.

People were gathered in a hotel, handcuffed, forced to find a mate or be turned into an animal.
The woman who shot the burro kicked a sweet border collie to death & then made fun of how it whined as it died. I walked out of the movie at this point. It is sheer evil. What message was the demented writer trying to convey with this? We were shown scenes of the Border Collie prior to this slaughter (and the animal is shown bloody & damaged, graphically). The woman quotes the exact words of a psychopathic mass shooter (American teenager) who killed his own dog this way.
So the writer stole his ideas from a psychopathic mass murderer. First of all, this isn't humorous in any way. It is hideous. Secondly, it's lazy writing, lifting lines from a well-publicized mass murder.
Again, not humorous at all.

I returned to watch, hoping for some redemption. Perhaps the Border Collie would be revived?
No, a horrific attempted suicide with the woman lying smashed on the pavement, howling in agony.
Not darkly humorous in any way.

The lead character, played by Colin Farrell, joins a group of people hiding from the hunters in a big wooded area. They make forays into a city (Dublin in real life) and continue their horribly boring dialogues to no end. He brings a woman slaughtered rabbits, their limp bodies bleeding awfully.
It's disgusting.

In the end, a woman is blinded by the leader of the forest group. Her BF stabs himself in the eyeballs (off stage) to be united with her.

Not one moment of this film redeems human or animal life. Absolutely DO NOT SEE if you value human or animal life. As we left the theater, everyone was talking about how disgusting the film was, how they had hoped for something good to happen at the end. We all agreed that the writers & director ( Efthimis Filippou. Co-writer. Efthymis Filippou worked with Yorgos Lanthimos, Director) should never get backing to do any other films, ever.",1464739200,9,2483,4.655251141552512

7485725,4,B0170FTFOY,"""The Lobster"" (2015 release from Europe; 118 min.) opens with a bang, literally. In the pre-opening credit scene, we see a woman getting out of her car, running into the field, and shooting a donkey (spurring gasps from the theater audience, more on that later). After the opening credits, we get to know David, whose wife has just left him. David is taken to a hotel where he now has 45 days to find a new mate or be transformed into an animal. If it gets that far, he chooses to be a lobster (""because they live to be a hundred, have blue blood in them, and are fertile their entire life""). ""Excellent choice"" responds the hotel manager, adding ""most people choose to be a dog, that's why you see dogs everywhere"". Will David find a mate? Or will he become a lobster? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously gave us the brilliant ""Dogtooth"". This is his debut English language film. Here he brings us a completely original, truly one-of-a-kind, story about love, be it mandatory love (first half of the movie), or prohibited love (second half of the movie). The movie feels strangely dispassionate yet engaging, in particular in the last 45 minutes. Colin Farrell brings the performance of a lifetime as David, your average ""Joe Six Pack"", slight beer belly and all. Even though Rachel Weisz gets second-to-top billing, she doesn't appear until the second half of the movie, but when she finally does, she blows everyone away as ""Short Sighted Woman"". There are many other choice performances, though: check out French actress La Seydoux as the ruthless leader of the ""loners"", always on the lookout to detect (and punish--""red kiss"" anyone?) any flirting between the loners. In the opening credits, all the different co-producers seemingly amount to a mini-European Union summit, as LOTS of European countries co-financed this movie. It's almost amazing to me that such an original and let's face it, very unconventional idea was able to garner the necessary financing or was able to convince first rate stars like Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz to sign on to this. But the main thing is that Lanthimos made it happen somehow.

""The Lobster"" made a huge splash at the 2015 Cannes film festival.  No idea why it's taken another full year to find its way onto the screen here in the US but better late than never I suppose. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but just okay (about 10-12 people). After the initial gasps, the audience settled in and laughed at all the right times. I can't see this playing in theaters a very long time, the movie is too ""weird"" and off-center for that. I happen to think it's one of the most original movies about love I've seen in a very, very long time, and would readily suggest that you check this out, be it in theaters, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Lobster"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1464393600,18,3178,4.7328519855595665
