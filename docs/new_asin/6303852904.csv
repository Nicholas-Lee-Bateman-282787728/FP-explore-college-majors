his writing and delivery can be challenging at first but when you catch up you begin to catch on.",1526256000,,206,3.813953488372093
7971397,5,6303852904,"Great film,
gives a good portrait of Bucky Fuller, &
all the talking is done by Fuller himself.
He was certainly a genius and visionary,
and I think he is too little known, and not really given all the credit he is due.
A must see for anyone interested in his work and ideas.",1294617600,13,275,4.111111111111111
7971398,5,6303852904,"I give this DVD a top rating because I love to see and listen to Buckminster Fuller speak about everything wondrous and compelling that one can also read about through his books: Synergy, the beauty of nature's principles and basic structures, physics, metaphysics, humanity's apparent purpose in the universe, the ""a priori infinite mystery"" of Universe (and Humans in Universe) and so much more. This piece consists of film clips mostly from the late '60s and early '70s of Bucky in various outdoor and indoor settings, talking about the ideas and interests that have inspired and informed his own sense of purpose and individual vitality. The film is mostly him speaking -- ""thinking out loud,"" as he would say, although there is also plenty of older footage of his inventions of the '30s and '40s with effective voice overs of him speaking. There is no narrator, which I find particularly refreshing because it allows the mood to breathe, so to speak, the aura of Bucky and the beautiful ideas that animated his life. What also comes through in this film is the character and genius of the man who ""dared to be naive,"" and who made it the task of his life to begin anew in the ""new life of the child,""  as though nearly every cultural determination in him had been suspended for the sole purpose of apprehending freshly the principles and structures of nature and the universe. So I would say that if you like Buckminster Fuller's writings and you enjoy seeing and hearing him speak, this documentary is highly recommended.",1281830400,23,1527,4.806083650190114
7971399,5,6303852904,"I was amazed at watching this and then listening to the fifty plus

hours that are online for free at Stanford University's website that

the editors of this documentary seemed to pick the most interesting

and activist statements by Fuller.  He comes out as the altruistic

futurist, always stretching the mind of his listeners.  You can

see his hand gestures, use of props, and in the presence of many

of his inventions.  There's much old footage, even of an automobile

he created.  One of the best videos out there, period.",1163030400,2,529,4.766666666666667
