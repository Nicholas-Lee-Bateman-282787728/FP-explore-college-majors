3157121,5,B0016K76V4,"This movie delievers. It has just the right amount of gore, violence, and black humor to appeal to me.
The action scenes look great and can stand along side the best scenes from Kill Bill. This movie takes the violence in Kill Bill and cranks it up several notches higher.
Also, it doesn't disappoint the gorehound in me.  It takes the gore from such directors as Lucio Fulci, George Romero, Dario Argento, and Mario Bava and takes it to the same extremes. In fact, one shot reminds me of the infamous vomiting up intestines scene from Fulci's Gates of Hell (City of the Living Dead.)
Despite all the bloodshed and killing, it really is a fun movie to watch. Just like Evil Dead II and Dawn of the Dead.
The pacing is fine for this type of entertainment. The movie isn't too slow or fast for my tastes.
Once the action starts, it erupts on the screen and doesn't stop.
It is much more entertaining than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Yashiro Minase is so cute as the lead actress, (especially when she isn't covered from head to toe in blood), that its hard not to fall in love with her character.
My only complaint is that Machine Girl should be playing at your local cinema instead of being available on DVD in the US. It deserves the big screen treatment.
I love all types of Japanese movies from Ozu, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi to Miike, Kitano, and Nakata and I think this film earns its place as a cool Japanese action movie.",1213315200,3,1445,4.452830188679245
3157122,5,B0016K76V4,"This review is from;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machine-Girl/dp/B0016K76V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machine Girl</a>

If you enjoy over-the-top Japanese action flicks such as ""Ichi the Killer"" & ""Battle Royale"" then this movie is right up your alley. I can't help, but think the lead actress's machine-gun arm was influenced by Rose McGowen's machine-gun leg in Rober Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"". The action in this movie is non-stop and the blood sprays farther than your backyard sprinkler. This is a very, gory movie, but it is actually comedic to watch because it is so silly. A chef is forced to eat his own fingers served ""sushi style"". Talking about finger food! the lady's drill bra is a trip to watch! Sorry, but the tempura arm actually made me hungry because it looked so crunchy and fluffy on the outside!

In a nut shell, the film is about a young lady's brother & friend who are brutally murdered by the son of Japanese Yakuza and his own friends. After an unsuccessful revenge attempt she survives, but her arm is unforunatley severed. After seeking refuge in the parents' house of her brother's slain friend, she is nursed back to health and her arm is outfitted with the ""hardware"". From then on, the violence driven by revenge ensues in extreme fashion!

As for the DVD it's a solid release by Tokyo Shock. Widescreen transfer, Japanese or English 5.1 language and subtitles. There is a 10 minute featurette with behind the scenes footage and cast interviews in Japanese with English subtitles. The trailer for ""the Machine Girl"" is included as well as trailers for other Tokyo Shock films.

Overall, this is fantastic and fun to watch for fanatics like me who appreciate unusual, over-the-top cinema like this, but not so for the light-hearted viewers! Can only be appreciated if you have a ""sick"" sense of humor for the extreme!",1213315200,2,1906,5.178571428571429

3157124,4,B0016K76V4,"OK , this movie is so good BECAUSE it is SO over the top. The violence is SO blood-spattering SO over the edge it truly makes this movie pop.

This is the best revenge movie since Kill Bill in my opinion.
If you want a comparision.. remember in Kill bill 1 the black and white sword fight? well imagine all that blood and gore and body parts... in COLOR.

Ok.. why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? the voiceover (if you select it) isn't that great. It sounds too much like they are in a studio and the movie is playing for them while they do the voiceover (yeah I know that's what they are doing, but this SOUNDS like it) .. so just leave it in Japanese and read the captions!

It is pure a pure Anime in real life, blood doesn't floor it sprays about 20 feet!

oh... and for those who saw the movie..

1) I doubt I will look at tempura the same way again :)
2) MAJOR blooper in the opening scene.. notice the ""magical re-appearing arm?"" I can't believe they missed that!

If you have ever seen ""Dead Alive"" then you know what to expect from this type of film. Blood, more blood and lots more blood!

There are many moments throughout the film that make you think you're reading a comic book and that's exactly what you're doing when watching this film. Hang your brain at the door and let your ID run free!

3157127,5,B0016K76V4,"Those two words are all you need to know. This movie is long on action, and short on plot. That's not to say there isn't a plot, but it's very predictable, and just barely cohesive enough to hold together the almost random scenes of gratuitous violence (Actually, violence isn't a good enough word. It's more like extreme slapstick) together.
However, there is a method to the madness. This is FAR more than a bunch of swordfights with arterial spray thrown in. The methods of death-dealing are what makes this movie an unexpected gem. Anyone can cut off a sushi chef's fingers, but what movie has the testicular fortitude to make him eat them afterwards?
If that's what you're into, then this movie won't sit on your shelf much. Every one of your equally sick friends will be wanting to borrow it, and that's a fact!",1212451200,3,817,4.641379310344828
3157128,4,B0016K76V4,"After her brother is murdered by a ninja-yakuza clan, a teenage girl seeks vengeance with her gatling gun. First and foremost, this movie has enough blood spray to fill Lake Erie. The death scenes are numerous, highly inventive, and extremely entertaining. The pacing is just about perfect, with the action scenes positioned within the running time in such a way that avoids any dullness. One surprising positive is the camera-work, which shows blood sprays for incredibly long periods of time. This is definitely a movie that soaks itself in excess. The story itself plays out rather seriously, but the black humor is laid on thick during the fights, so some laugh-out-loud moments are almost guaranteed along the way. This is a very satisfying action gore-fest because of its impressively long finale.

I've already heard some artsy snobs complaining about this movie in terms of character development. I'm just wondering why these tards even decided to watch this movie to begin with. They should have known exactly what they were going to get. You don't see the name Tsai Ming-liang on the DVD case, do you?

This really was my summer blockbuster popcorn flick of 2008. Everyone else can have their little CGI prairie dogs, animated monkeys, and space aliens. You can have your superheros, sequels, and remakes (can Hollywood think of anything new?). The fact remains that THIS movie should be playing on 3,000 screens! That will never happen in the USA though with it's dumb-as-dirt moviegoers who flock like sheep to see the most derivative tripe dished out by those Californian bloodsuckers. Do you people have ANY standards whatsoever?

On a positive note, that's 2-for-2 this year in terms of my most highly anticipated films. ""Chocolate"" (a Thai action flick) and ""The Machine Girl"" were both insanely entertaining. I have full confidence that ""Tokyo Gore Police"" will be something really, really special. And maybe ""High School Girl Rika: Zombie Hunter"", ""Negative Happy Chainsaw Edge"", and ""Onechanbara"" can round out a great 2008 for Japanese Horror.

You don't get great stuff like this out of the States. Man, is there any reason to watch American movies anymore?",1212364800,33,2178,5.092436974789916
3157129,3,B0016K76V4,"This is the story of Ami Hyuga, the older sister of Yu Hyuga. They're all each other has as their parents committed suicide after being suspected of committing murder. When Yu starts being bullied by Sho, whose father is part of the yakuza, and his gang...things start to get ugly. Yu is told to bring Sho insane amounts of money or else Sho will go after Ami to put her in his father's whorehouse. Takeshi, a friend of Yu's, is on the same boat and when they don't pay the gang one day...they pay the consequences. Now, with Yu gone, Ami swears revenge. She winds up at Sho's house and tries to avenge her brother's death, but winds up getting captured...and loses an arm in the process. After she escapes, she manages to make it back to Takeshi's house. His parents wind up helping her and Takeshi's father makes it his responsibility to make her a machine gun for an arm. Thus Machine Girl is born.

I went into this with not necessarily high expectations, but I had been looking forward to it since I'd been keeping up with trailers and clips when they were released. It looked ridiculous and like it was going to be a lot of fun. The problem though was that I feel like I wound up biting off more than I could chew. The film was ridiculous, but way more than I was expecting. This movie is over the top in every sense of the phrase. The gore is outlandish, the acting is overdone, and the storyline is completely ridiculous. I went in wanting this to be a fun gore fest and walked out with an unexpected helping or two of cheese.

Machine Girl isn't completely horrible. It's still pretty entertaining. While the acting is overdone, it's pretty humorous at times. The fact that blood sprays in every direction for several minutes in just about every other scene in the film is entertaining in itself. There are several scenes in the film that are so over the top and so ludicrous that you can't help but laugh.

If you don't take this film too seriously, you may have some fun with it. It's like they knew ahead of time that this film couldn't be serious and took full advantage of it while they were making it. The movie is worth watching for some of the fight scenes alone as they're some of the bloodiest I've ever seen.",1212105600,3,2228,4.402912621359223

3157157,3,B0016K76V4,"What can I say? I am a fan if Japanese Cinema Sci-Fi and Action/Adventure, but not really anime. This movie is one of the ultra-violent female based action flicks coming out of Japan classified as ""Pink-Horror"" or ""Pink-Violence"". It really put me in the mind of watching a live action Anime movie that's kind of a cross between RoboCop and Planet Terror shot by John Waters. If you like that stuff then go ahead and buy it, but in my opinion there are better movies out there in this genre. I could only give this movie 3 stars.

I think the movie falls short because it takes itself so seriously, that it kills any fun to be had. Even the ultra-violent Robocop had a sense of humor, which this movie appears to lack. Here's two examples where this movie went off the tracks for me:

---Half Spoiler---
There are two scenes where the heroine encounters kill crazy mothers of her enemies. I feel the movie completely derailed in both of the scenes.
1) The kitchen ""Tempura"" scene. Over the top and played completely deadly serious. Huh? It had to be comedy, especially with the end result, but it is not portrayed that way.
2) In the ultimate battle at the end, the weapon the Yakuza mother uses is completely ridiculous, yet again they try to portray it with absolute seriousness.
Both times I just sat there and thought ""What the heck am I watching?"" I didn't laugh, and I certainly wasn't scared. I guess I was just kind of confused. They just completely lost me. Could be me.
---end half spoiler---

A lot of this movie was shot in a grainy film noire aspect that I feel did not come over well in High Definition it looked worse trhan an upscaled DVD. So in my opinion, if you want this movie, just skip the Blu-Ray and get the DVD. There is an extra disk that came with in Blu-Ray package with a few short films on it. If you really want that, then get the Blu-Ray I guess, but I feel like I wasted the money.

Personally, and I know I am going to catch hell for this, I thought the Blu-Ray of ""Robo Geisha"" was much more appropriate. The bright vibrant colors and clear High Def picture were well worth the extra money. It is also a movie that does not take itself too seriously, (it more than embraces the silly) so I enjoyed it a lot more.

With a flagship title such as this (which i would assume since they made limited steelbook)you really ought to treat the Blu-ray with extra care.  A pristine VHS copy will not pass for 1080p.

3157160,3,B0016K76V4,"Just to throw this out there - Tokyo Shock either needs to step it up, or get out of the Blu-Ray business.

Their latest effort, Machine Girl, hits Blu-Ray with a number of problems.

Let me start off by saying I really like the movie. It's an over-the-top, low-budget, Japanese action/comedy film. Similar to movies like Riki-Oh, Vampire girl vs. Frankenstein girl, Tokyo Gore Police, Mutant Girls' Squad and a number of other titles). Very gory, but very entertaining! The other reviews should give you an idea of what to expect - or just pull up the trailer. You should be able to tell if it's ""for you"" or not. My 3 star-rating is for the BLU-RAY, not the movie.

Anyways, I bought the original DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machine-Girl/dp/B0016K76V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machine Girl</a>

...Then a couple months later they released a 2-disc DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machine-Girl/dp/B0029Z8KCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machine Girl</a>&nbsp;Remix -- I bought that too!

A few months after that, they had the nerve to release a 3-disc DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Machine-Girl-Collectors-Tin-3pc-Ws/dp/B00393SG2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Machine Girl: Collectors Tin (3pc) (Ws)</a>&nbsp;- I even bought that one.

4 days later, they announce the Blu-Ray.

Being a sucker for the movie, and having already bought it 3 times (what harm is a 4th time??) - I bit.

A little back information here - in addition to Tokyo Shock's need to re-release movies multiple times with little differences (in the above cases, the 2 disc set was the same as the original Disc 1, but with an added short film (20 minutes) on disc 2. The 3 disc set were the previous 2 discs and a 3rd with some extras), they put very little effort into their blu-rays (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ichi-the-Killer-Blu-ray/dp/B001OBBR42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ichi the Killer [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Gore-Police-Blu-ray/dp/B004L49JYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Gore Police [Blu-ray</a>] ).

Knowing this, I decided to give them a chance.

Problem #1:

The case states ""2X DISC SET"" - much like with the Tokyo Gore Police Blu-Ray, this is just an error (?) as there is only 1 disc inside. Don't get excited thinking they put all the extras onto 1 disc either, as you'd be mistaken.

The back of the case lists:
* Special features DVD with interviews and promo events
* Machine Girl Lite feature
* Behind the scenes of Machine Girl
* Original Trailer

The ""Special features DVD with interviews and promo events"" is what's missing. This sounds like the 3rd DVD from the 'Ultimate Machine Girl' set above. No big deal for me since I own it, but it would have definitely bumped up my review (as this Blu-Ray is 1/3rd the price of the Ultimate DVD).

On the bright side, it does have the Machine Girl Lite short film (~20 minutes). All the extras are in 480i, not HD.

Audio is in either DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 or 5.1 (and English or Japanese) - I can't comment on it as I don't have a DTS-HD MA system, but the bitrates appear to be around 1.2 - 1.6 mbps throughout. Don't expect much though.

The video is probably one of the worst looking Blu-Rays out there. Not faulting Tokyo Shock completely on this one (as these are generally low-budget films), but it doesn't even seem High-Definition. There are jagged lines through (aliasing problems), terrible video noise, banding, and it's all noticeable from a distance away (I saw about 8 feet from a 50"" TV and could easily see it). The flickering during motion scenes was the worst. The video was also uneven, looking good in some scenes, horrible in others. Probably an issue with brightness (indoors/outdoors).

In the end, this is basically the MACHINE GIRL DVD + MACHINE GIRL REMIX DVD, on a Blu-Ray disc. This Blu-Ray is (currently..) cheaper than the regular DVDs, and for that it's probably worth buying. It can regularly be found for 10-12 dollars, which isn't bad. I wouldn't pay much more though.

Long story short -

If you own a previous DVD, PASS on this one.
If you don't own it, but are interested, go for the Blu-Ray.

If the missing extras (and nice Steelbook case) are important to you, go for the (very expensive) Ultimate Edition 3-disc DVD.",1303948800,17,4511,5.500723589001447

This girl gets her arm cut off and bleeds and keeps talking after she loses like 10 gallons of blood spraying out all over everything and everyone. Her boy friend or brother gets shuricans threw him and he keeps talking then falls apart in to multiple peaces. Wow the kicker is when she chops off this dudes head and then drags his corps to the bath room to squeeze his body on to his brother so the blood can spray all over him. What Horrible junky crap is that. I mean like come on!!! There is no real plot and no real dialogue. But there is allot of action that is why I gave it 1 star. Its not all lost.

After a narrow escape, she is aided by another victim's family, who helps her to build a powerful weapon in order to destroy the Kimura clan once and for all! MACHINE GIRL blasts its way into the next generation of Tokyo shock cinema alongside its ultra-violent cousins like MEATBALL MACHINE, ROBOGEISHA, and TOKYO GORE POLICE. Splatter specialist Yoshihiro Nishimura puts on another vulgar display of missing limbs, exploding heads, and other absurd gags that use everything from chainsaws to drill bras. The film's bloody revenge plot shares much more in common with the Japanese grindhouse classics like LONE WOLF AND CUB or LADY SNOWBLOOD rather than the more recent gorefests, although they each contain plenty of high-powered action sequences and geysers of blood. The acting and storyline here are also taken slightly more seriously than the other films of its kind despite its lighter tone. MACHINE GIRL's endless brutality and off-the-wall humor make it a must-see for hardcore gore fans!

3157166,4,B0016K76V4,"Machine Girl (Kataude mashin gru): 7 out of 10: People in Japan must have very high blood pressure. They don't bleed in Machine Girl, as much as they outright gush gallons of the red stuff. The effect is so over the top it adds a sense of outrageous humor to what could have been a fairly grim affair. After all the story concerns a college girl who gets a prosthetic weapon attached to her elbow after a member of the Yakuza amputates her lower arm to disused her from investigating the suiciding of her younger brother.

This quick synopsis actually understates the depravity our heroine undergoes before she gets all Death Wish on anyone with a shiny business suit.

Our Rick Allenesqe heroine is played by the delightful and delicious Japanese model/actress Minase Yashiro. In fact one of the movies strong points is a quite attractive cast wearing schoolgirl outfits and camo like some cosplayers wet dream. Mono-named Asami and Honoka join Yashiro to round out the attractive female cast.

Machine Girl however never really hooks the viewer emotionally. It is all so over the top and cartoonish. Exploitation films often benefit from allowing the audience to get emotionally involved with the characters (Think Mad Max or Savage Streets). I don't blame the actresses in this case; I simply think the script could have taken a breather from the silliness to add some much needed poignancy.

The entire film plays like an overlong Monty Python skit. It has great set pieces, decent special effects and enough fetish material to keep a Chaku-ero fan in his basement for a week. It simply doesn't tell a compelling story, nor does it allow one to become attached to any of the characters involved.

That said however, I simply cannot dislike a film that features a bra made out of industrial drills. So turn you mind off, send the misses out shopping and enjoy.",1266537600,,1863,4.809375

Noboru Iguchi directed this film and he did a good job. A young girl named Ami has the responsibility of taking care of her younger brother after a tragic suicide by her parents. What she doesn't know is that her brother is in debt to a yakuza members son. When her brother and his friend mysteriously dies (by way of suicide to some) she goes looking for answers. After a brave attempt she loses her arm but she is found by the friends mother and is revived. Now it's time for strike two.

Plot Rating

I've done some revenge reviews before but this one is incredibly fun. With the great fight scenes and wonderful technology that the bad guys are wielding. (drill braw) my favorite thing. This movie has a lot going for it not so much for how it was shot but because of the fun atmosphere it carries. They definitely knew they were making an over the top film with lots of blood. I give this plot a 7 out of 10.

Actors/Actresses

For Minase Yashiro this is her first film and she carries the movie. She goes from being a cute school girl to a tough ass kicking gun-slinging death machine who will stop at nothing to find her brothers killer. Although this part might type cast her to be in more over the top type movies. Ami plays Miki and she's a tough angry woman. She doesn't let anything stop her even when she's got swords in her chest. Although Miki has more experience than Yashiro it doesn't show and they worked well off of each other. The acting gets a 7 out of 10.

DVD Extras

Tokyo Shock bring us this lovely video and we get a behind the scenes look with interviews by some of the actors and actresses that were in the film. There's the original trailer for the film. There is also a Trailers button in the main menu where you get to take a look at four films. Although there were some extras I would have liked to see an interview done with the Director. I give these extras a 6 out of 10.

Personal Thoughts

This movie is (although I've said it before) an over the top blood fest. I mean there's more blood in Tokyo Gore Police but this movie is a hard act to follow with all the blood going on here. The acting is good for a movie that is suppose to be a little funny. (Tempura arm) that is so great.

This movie altogether gets a 20 out of 30. I highly recommend this movie to any asian scifi fans or someone who is a fan of asian cinema or if your looking for some fun martial arts, gun blasting heads off, drill braw action.",1265846400,,2458,4.2106382978723405

The story revolves around Ami (Minase Yashiro), a schoolgirl out for revenge against the Yakuza for the death of her brother.  In the process she loses her arm, and has it replaced with an ultra heavy-duty machine gun!  Alongside her is Miki (Asami), whose son was a victim to said Yakuza as well; and both plot a path of bloody revenge.  Filled with some deliberately over the top cheesey moments to correlate with the massive amounts blood-letting and limb chopping, The Machine Girl is definitely not something meant for all tastes, but if any of this sounds appealing to you in the least, then this is something that you should definitely see to believe.

3157171,4,B0016K76V4,"My guess is that  Noboru Iguchi, the director of Machine Girl, has been keeping a journal of the most creative and disgusting ways to separate a person from his various body parts. He sits down in a dark room under a low-watt light bulb, and with each entry he throws his head back and cackles. His parents can hear him from upstairs and they wonder...

Hee emerges weeks later with The Machine Girl.  He pushes a red button, and his minions come cowering into the room. He pitches the idea, and they nod fervently, drooling with approval. Iguchi then orders them away and to come back with a plot synopsis. They scurry off.

One of them comes back with this: ""Ami is a tough but otherwise average high school girl, trying to lead a normal life. Her world comes crashing down when her brother and his friend are killed by ruthless bullies.""

Iguchi slams his hand on the table, unsheathes a sword that we weren't aware of until now, and then separates the fool's head from his shoulders. The other minion recoil in fear. Iguchi demands a new synopsis.

I, yes I, emerge. With this: ""Girl with a half arm, attaches a Gatling gun to her stump and goes ballistic on a gang lord family. Cough syrup squirts from every human orifice.""

Iguchi raises his sword, but I have already ran off. I did not stick around to see him lick the goulash residue from his sword, smiling in approval. ""Exceeellleent"" he sez with a demonic grin.

3157188,4,B0016K76V4,"For the most part I've tried to write here about mainstream DVDs being released. On occasion I've chosen to let you know about other films making their way to direct DVD release. Today let's look at something else. Movies that never see release in the US (or at best limited release) that find their way to DVD. The subject in question is THE MACHINE GIRL.

For anyone unfamiliar with the latest trend in Japanese films, it's not the horror films being remade non-stop. Instead, it's a gore drenched action adventure films that are over the top in their depictions and filled with blood soaked humor. When someone gets cut, they don't bleed, they gush fountains of blood literally.

THE MACHINE GIRL starts out with action from the get go. When a group of young punks attack an innocent pair of school kids, a lone girl dressed in school uniform dress comes to their aid. This is no ordinary girl though. This is Ami and she is on a mission to seek revenge against this very gang for destroying her family.

The battle kicks off in high flying ninja-martial arts style, fist to fist. But all changes when Ami reveals that she's missing an arm. A quick pop into her school backpack, and she's now sporting a gattling gun where the lost appendage would normally be. And she knows how to use said gun as she begins cutting her way through bad guys, splitting one right down the middle.

The story moves to flashback where we learn how it all began. Ami and her brother live on their own, their parents having been killed. Her brother is picked on by the local teen gang led by the son of a Yakuza (think Japanese Mafia) boss. When her brother and his best friend are killed by the gang,

Ami tries to get the help of a local law enforcement official who turns out to be the father of one of the gang members. The mother attacks Ami, forcing her hand and arm down into a boiling pot of tempura being cooked, resulting in a terribly burnt arm covered in the batter. Barely escaping, Ami sets out to get revenge the old fashioned way.

Too bad because the Yakuza boss captures her in his house and rather than atone for his son's actions, applauds them and tortures Ami, finally cutting off her arm in a garden hose type squirting sequence that is so far over the top you find yourself thinking ""Where do they come up with this stuff?""

Ami escapes and with the help of the mother of her brother's best friend, a mechanic, is outfitted with the afore mentioned gattling type machine gun for an arm. When the Yakuza turns up to catch her once more, Ami opens fire and takes out the highly trained ninja's who attack, leaving them a bloody pulp.

Subsequent revenge attacks on the rest of the gang, leads to their parents forming themselves into a combat outfit supplied by the Yakuza boss to take on Ami and the mechanic mom. The final blood gorged battle between them makes for one of the goriest sequences ever filmed.

So is the film entertaining? Yeah, it is. As I said, it's so far over the top as to be cartoonish in the gore and blood flow. The ultra violent world of Japanese anime goes further than this film, so it's little more than one of those cartoons come to life.

If you laugh at absurd extremism then this film should have you falling on the floor laughing. If you have a more subdued taste or find gore not to your liking then by all means pass this one by. And if you're just kind of curious to see what other cultures do when they make movies in their native tongue, then give this one a try. Afterwards you might even be ready to take on OLDBOY, another over the top violent flick that's become a cult fave among DVD owners.

It's not for everyone, but this film does offer something new, something fresh, something different. If that sounds interesting to you, give this one a look.",1222128000,,3798,4.434720229555237
3157189,2,B0016K76V4,"""The Machine Girl"" follows the story of bloody revenge of Ami, an ordinary Japanese high school girl whose brother is killed by a spoiled son of a ninja clan. Or was that yakuza, Japanese mafia? Never mind. One-armed Ami fights ferociously with a machinegun attached to the left arm. She kills like Rambo (of the newest film), fighting the evil crime syndicate Hattori. The resourceful Hattori clan fights back with flying daggers and a flying guillotine. Oh, and don't forget a bra. Yes, a bra can be very dangerous.

Some may think director Noboru Iguchi's film ""Kataude Mashin Garu"" (literally translated ""One-Armed Machine Girl"") is Japan's answer to ""Kill Bill"" or ""Grindhouse"" and numerous exploitation films that have inspired the Tarantino-Rodriguez film, especially Rodriguez segment of ""Grindhouse."" However, ""The Machine Girl"" (which is actually produced by an American company, shot with all-Japanese cast in Japan) lacks the high-octane energy and crazy fun Rodriguez is known for. ""The Machine Girl"" is funny and entertaining, but only sporadically.

I think I know what the director is trying to do. He is obviously more attracted to old-fashioned Japanese films and TV shows. The ruthless wife of the Hattori Clan's boss is a nod to Japanese yakuza films; the three ninja-like assassins in red suit are parody of Japanese ""sentai"" (fighters) actions, still popular genre in Japan; and the heroine's story (and tortures) is probably inspired by the Japanese revenge drama in the 70s like ""The Female Prisoner 701: Scorpion"" (starring Meiko Kaji, inspiration of the Uma Thurman character in ""Kill Bill""). Some of the cast are good, some just amateurs. Minase Yashiro, known as gravure idol (model), did a fine job as the cute heroine that tunes into a killing machine. But something is missing here.

The film's biggest problem for me is not its excessive gores; it is the way they are used. As the film provides lots of blood, body count rises, but the pace is sluggish and deaths look repetitious. Except some nice gadgets, the film offers nothing new. Sloppy editing sometimes ruins the action scenes that could have been better with faster pace. Also, dialogues are not the best kind even in original Japanese and jokes including sushi and tempura are not very funny.

Perhaps ""The Machine Girl"" could be better with shorter running time. Not a big success, not a big disappointment either.",1221004800,3,2408,5.0886075949367084

the blood-soaked girl of my dreams.
I think you're gatling gun arm was just super.
You were so bloody I could bathe in your torrents of gore.
And I loved that some of the color in your scenes were washed out.
Your were so pretty that night, with your plots of vengeance.
Remember when you severed that punks hand with a sickle,
or kicked a pipe through that other punks mouth, and out the back of his head.
That was just lovely.
You really made my night with that one.
Or the time you busted a hole in that red-ninja,
and then aimed through it and mowed another hole in his buddies skull.
Don't you remember all we've been through together,
the decaptations, the horizontal & vertical mutilations,
the showers of blood together.
We had so many romantic dinners, like the fried arm, and the finger sushi.
Remember that knife through that womans mouth,
oh what a joy to see her vomit blood on her sons decapitated head.
We had some good times didn't we??
Don't get me wrong every special effect we had was as corny as ""he who walks behind the rows"".
But they were fun weren't they.
Don't you recall??
Pounding nails in our enemies face,
the chainsaw leg, the flying guillotine, and the motorized drill bra.
I can't believe our bloody, slow-mo, skull-swapping conclusion.

Come back to me Machine Girl,
I love you,
I need to feel your waves of blood on my face again.

It's been a week since I watched this movie, and still the only word I can come up with to describe it is WHAT. Machine Girl is... something different, that's for sure. A spoof of action/horror movies that's never quite over-the-top enough to tip you off that the director isn't taking it seriously, a camp classic where the acting isn't quite truly bad enough to qualify, a special-effects extravaganza where the special effects are just fake enough to let you know it's not a special-effects extravaganza... you get the idea. If it wanted to be all those things and fell just short, it's as massive a failure of a movie as I've seen in years. If, however, it's supposed to be that way, it's genius.

So anyway, there's not a great deal of plot here. No surprise. Ami (porn actress Asami) is a schoolgirl whose brother is killed by bullies, one of whom is the son of the local Yakuza branch. When she tries to get revenge, she loses her left arm. She teams up with Miki (softcore actress Honoka), the mother of one of Ami's brother's friends who was also killed in the attack, and Miki teaches Ami martial arts while her husband makes Ami a machine-gun arm. And, well, you can guess what happens from there.

Machine Girl is nothing more than stupid fun, and if you go into it with that attitude, you'll have a good time. It's not meant to be deathless cinema (at least, I don't think it is), just a fun time you can use to while away ninety minutes. And in that vein, it's great stuff-- cheesy dialogue, over-the-top painfully fake gore, lots of one-liners.

3157203,4,B0016K76V4,"My short review would be Machine Girl is awesome! Unfortunately short reviews are for punks so I gotta keep going.

Machine Girl stars Minase Yashiro as Ami, a pretty high schooler who's a bit of a tomboy. Ami cares for her younger brother Yu since their parents committed suicide after a supposed murder frame up leaving the kids to fend for themselves.

Amis brother and his best friend Takashi are killed by an extorting bully who is also the son of a Yakuza Ninja couple who are a few rice balls short of a bento box.
Of course the only way for a young girl to get justice is to seek revenge on the boys who killed her brother. Maybe that murder frame up in her families past wasn't such a frame up since Ami seems really quick to turn to homicidal tendencies. Even her brother had a list in his diary of people he wanted to kill, which leads Ami in her schoolgirl uniform to her first violent confrontation with a family of one of her brothers killers.

I don't think I'm giving anything away by revealing Ami eventually loses an arm in her quest for bloody vengeance. This leads to an alliance with Takashis mechanic parents. Miki, excellently played by Japanese AV star Asami, takes her under her wing and trains Ami to fight while Sugeru, the father, constructs a machine gun arm to replace Ami's missing limb.

There is one other star of this film. Arterial spray. This flick shoots as much of the red stuff as any Lone Wolf and Cub film. Doesn't matter if you lose a finger or get stabbed in the head. Blood will spurt in unbelievable amounts. Half the film seems to be filmed in a pink mist, and that's fine by me. I haven't seen exaggerated maiming like this since the classic Story Of Ricky-O. As outrageous as Ricky-O was, the violence seems even stronger when it centers around a beautiful girl with an amazing smile.

I gotta tell you. Guy or gal, if you don't fall in love with the screen combo of Ami and Miki then your tastes probably run to the ultra fetishist or non human since both women are gorgeous, tough and sexy.

There are so many high points to this film. The Red Junior High School Ninjas, the Super Mourners Gang comprised of parents of boys Ami has taken revenge on. A chainsaw leg and a drill bra, I'll wait for that one to sink in, A Drill BRA rounding out the mechanics of destruction. Finger sushi, face nailing, the list goes on and on!

Machine Girl is a near perfect modern revenge flick. It is thoroughly entertaining and never takes itself too seriously. Of course if you don't like gore for gores sake, you may want to skip this one. I recommend putting the kids to sleep, getting some friends over and creating a drinking game based on this film and the copious amount of bloodletting. You'll be drunk before the credits roll.

Machine Girl moves into my top list of films to join such classics as Shaun and Dawn of the Dead, Battle Royale and Kill Bill to name a few.",1215043200,,2912,4.409683426443203

3157208,3,B0016K76V4,"Machine Girl is a film that seeks to be every type of cult japanese film that it can be in its short running time all wrapped up in a big bow of exploitation. Theres the revenge quotient, some chanbara action with yakuza and wrapped up with a bunch of other stuff I'm too meak to categorize. Its main distributor Nikkatsu is known for producing mainly exploitation films and really the film isn't very serious and silly at the most. But what more can you think when a movies villains aren't only Yakuza but descendants of the Ninja Hattori Hanzo. Despite the glowing sense of stupidity that permeates the whole thing I was wearing a big stupid grin on my face through the whole mess of a film.

Ami is a likeable college student good at basketball who takes care of her younger brother Yu. Of course in the opening minutes we learn that Yu is being bullied and unfortunately tries to fight back. This unfortunately leads to him a friend being thrown to their deaths. Ami trying hard to do the right thing finds herself assaulted by the family she confronts (having her hand fried as tempura but thats not what necesitates the machine gun arm). She then goes into revenge mode and everything goes further into crazy territory as Ami looses her arm and after teaming up with the parents of the Yu's murdered friend gains a gatling gun for an arm. But that doesn't even begin to describe things like a drill bra, a high school ninja assassin team and some reaonably well done gore.

I find it hard to really defend or critique a film this ridiculous. The acting is bland and straight out of the b-movie quality it should be. The gore is too obvious and over the top but once they showed a screaming head with its face torn off any idea that they might have been aiming for realism vanished (and was never there to begin with). And the villains were so overdone but funny in their own little way (not including a crooked police man and his laughing wife, the main villains feed someone his fingers as his sushi and induce their bodygaurds to necrophilia with odd reasoning).

Even their son is dressed to be an evil effeminate pansy if I've ever seen one so, of course, you'd want to see him blown away in the end.  Everyone's kinda sick in this movie.

3157210,4,B0016K76V4,"MACHINE GIRL (aka. One-Armed Machine Girl)  is an over-the-top, campy, ultra-violent action film by Iguchi Noboru (Sukeban Boy). The film is definitely NOT for everyone but will appeal to fans of Japanese cult films with a touch of dark comedy and unrealistic ultra-bloody violence made popular by Ichi the Killer and even Tarantino's magnificent ""Kill Bill"". Folks will either applaud or be repulsed by this film's execution, but it is a wickedly twisted, darkly-toned entertainment that knows exactly what it's going for. The film features well-known Japanese bikini model Minase Yashiro in her first feature role, ex-AV star Asami and the beautiful Honoka as the Yakuza boss' twisted wife. Do I have your attention yet?

Plot synopsis partly derived from the back cover:
Ami (Minase Yashiro) is a tough but otherwise average high school girl, trying to lead a normal life with her younger brother. Her whole world comes crushing down when her brother and his friend are killed by ruthless bullies led by a Yakuza Boss' son. When she goes to find those responsible, she finds herself in over her head and minus her left arm. Barely surviving, Ami escapes and finds shelter from a kindly mechanic and his wife Miki (Asami) who also happen to be the parents of her brother`s friend. They take pity on Ami's plight, helping her heal, training her and fitting her with a powerful machine gun where her left arm used to be. She then teams up with the tough mother to seek vengeance and together they unleash an unholy, non-stop, over the top kill fest against the equally creative machinery of their ruthless Ninja-Yakuza enemies.

The film is a wild blend of 70's ""pink violence"" and 80's super-violent splatter horror that doesn't take itself seriously. The film is full of bloody sequences and oddball weird humor that will undoubtedly garner a cult following. It was quite inventive of the filmmakers to rely on ""old-school"" style violence to conduct the visual blood and gore. Whether this decision was made because of budget constraints or some other factor, it made the film work; from an entertainment standpoint kind of way. The exaggerated gallons of blood complements the film's action sequences; chainsaw-fu, machine gun-fu, swordplay and brassiere-fu are the film's many unorthodox style of brutality. The film is an example of an adult-Tokusatsu (Kid's TV show)with the wild blend of action, camp, humor, sci-fi and even horror that plays like a stunt/Gore show.

The film also has some campy ideas that will make you say; ""What the heck"" as the film makes fun of certain anime-inspired names such as ""Super Mourner Gang"" and ""Junior high Shuriken gang"" seem attempts to somewhat tone down all the violence and brutality displayed. There are also twisted touches of oddball humor with the ""sushi fingers"" and ""tempura arm"".  I've always wondered how Hellraiser's ""Pinhead"" got that look; Miki and Ami were very obliged to demonstrate how that sinister look can come about in a human being.

Sexy Minase Yashiro plays the lead, I'm a little undecided as to how well her first starring performance is. She has the right school girl look and she has a lot of charisma, but at times she looks a little awkward with the action sequences. Asami plays Miki and she looks a little young and definitely too cool to be the mother of a teenager. Nude model Honoka adds a lot of eye-candy as the wife of Yakuza boss Kimura. The woman is twisted in her own way, she has that no-nonsense appeal further accentuated by Honoka's sheer sexiness. She is seductively, yet creepily appealing as she displays her ""Drill Brassiere"" as an added campy display of villainy. Shimazu Kentaro is the Yakuza Boss who seemed to have been based on ""Heihachi Yashima"" from the ""tekken"" video game. The whirling and hurling flying razor sharp ""bucket"" adds more to the film's twistedly, campy appeal. Boss Kimura an intimidating villain although he isn't an originally fresh concept.

With Ami's Sailor Moon-inspired outfit, sentai/tokusatsu heroism, references to ninja and Yakuza elements, the film is definitely aimed at anime fan boys and those very initiated with Japanese cinema. The film's enjoyment requires a very large suspension of disbelief for its entirety. Take two cups of ""Shoot `Em Up"", three tablespoons of ""Darkman"" and even ""Planet Terror"" to two gallons of ""Ichi The Killer"" and stir vigorously, then you will have an accurate idea just how this film plays out. The film doesn't take itself seriously and if ""Machine Girl"" is any indication of the filmmakers take on twisted entertainment, then I'm sold to see ""Tokyo Gore Police"".

The action scenes look great and can stand along side the best scenes from Kill Bill. This movie takes the violence in Kill Bill and cranks it up several notches higher.
Also, it doesn't disappoint the gorehound in me.  It takes the gore from such directors as Lucio Fulci, George Romero, Dario Argento, and Mario Bava and takes it to the same extremes. In fact, one shot reminds me of the infamous vomiting up intestines scene from Fulci's Gates of Hell (City of the Living Dead.)
Despite all the bloodshed and killing, it really is a fun movie to watch. Just like Evil Dead II and Dawn of the Dead.
The pacing is fine for this type of entertainment. The movie isn't too slow or fast for my tastes.
Once the action starts, it erupts on the screen and doesn't stop.
It is much more entertaining than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Yashiro Minase is so cute as the lead actress, (especially when she isn't covered from head to toe in blood), that its hard not to fall in love with her character.
My only complaint is that Machine Girl should be playing at your local cinema instead of being available on DVD in the US. It deserves the big screen treatment.
I love all types of Japanese movies from Ozu, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi to Miike, Kitano, and Nakata and I think this film earns its place as a cool Japanese action movie.",1213315200,3,1445,4.452830188679245

If you enjoy over-the-top Japanese action flicks such as ""Ichi the Killer"" & ""Battle Royale"" then this movie is right up your alley. I can't help, but think the lead actress's machine-gun arm was influenced by Rose McGowen's machine-gun leg in Rober Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"". The action in this movie is non-stop and the blood sprays farther than your backyard sprinkler. This is a very, gory movie, but it is actually comedic to watch because it is so silly. A chef is forced to eat his own fingers served ""sushi style"". Talking about finger food! the lady's drill bra is a trip to watch! Sorry, but the tempura arm actually made me hungry because it looked so crunchy and fluffy on the outside!

In a nut shell, the film is about a young lady's brother & friend who are brutally murdered by the son of Japanese Yakuza and his own friends. After an unsuccessful revenge attempt she survives, but her arm is unforunatley severed. After seeking refuge in the parents' house of her brother's slain friend, she is nursed back to health and her arm is outfitted with the ""hardware"". From then on, the violence driven by revenge ensues in extreme fashion!

As for the DVD it's a solid release by Tokyo Shock. Widescreen transfer, Japanese or English 5.1 language and subtitles. There is a 10 minute featurette with behind the scenes footage and cast interviews in Japanese with English subtitles. The trailer for ""the Machine Girl"" is included as well as trailers for other Tokyo Shock films.

If you want a comparision.. remember in Kill bill 1 the black and white sword fight? well imagine all that blood and gore and body parts... in COLOR.

Ok.. why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? the voiceover (if you select it) isn't that great. It sounds too much like they are in a studio and the movie is playing for them while they do the voiceover (yeah I know that's what they are doing, but this SOUNDS like it) .. so just leave it in Japanese and read the captions!

It is pure a pure Anime in real life, blood doesn't floor it sprays about 20 feet!

oh... and for those who saw the movie..

1) I doubt I will look at tempura the same way again :)
2) MAJOR blooper in the opening scene.. notice the ""magical re-appearing arm?"" I can't believe they missed that!

That's not to say there isn't a plot, but it's very predictable, and just barely cohesive enough to hold together the almost random scenes of gratuitous violence (Actually, violence isn't a good enough word. It's more like extreme slapstick) together.
However, there is a method to the madness. This is FAR more than a bunch of swordfights with arterial spray thrown in. The methods of death-dealing are what makes this movie an unexpected gem. Anyone can cut off a sushi chef's fingers, but what movie has the testicular fortitude to make him eat them afterwards?
If that's what you're into, then this movie won't sit on your shelf much. Every one of your equally sick friends will be wanting to borrow it, and that's a fact!",1212451200,3,817,4.641379310344828

First and foremost, this movie has enough blood spray to fill Lake Erie. The death scenes are numerous, highly inventive, and extremely entertaining. The pacing is just about perfect, with the action scenes positioned within the running time in such a way that avoids any dullness. One surprising positive is the camera-work, which shows blood sprays for incredibly long periods of time. This is definitely a movie that soaks itself in excess. The story itself plays out rather seriously, but the black humor is laid on thick during the fights, so some laugh-out-loud moments are almost guaranteed along the way. This is a very satisfying action gore-fest because of its impressively long finale.

I've already heard some artsy snobs complaining about this movie in terms of character development. I'm just wondering why these tards even decided to watch this movie to begin with. They should have known exactly what they were going to get. You don't see the name Tsai Ming-liang on the DVD case, do you?

This really was my summer blockbuster popcorn flick of 2008. Everyone else can have their little CGI prairie dogs, animated monkeys, and space aliens. You can have your superheros, sequels, and remakes (can Hollywood think of anything new?). The fact remains that THIS movie should be playing on 3,000 screens! That will never happen in the USA though with it's dumb-as-dirt moviegoers who flock like sheep to see the most derivative tripe dished out by those Californian bloodsuckers. Do you people have ANY standards whatsoever?

On a positive note, that's 2-for-2 this year in terms of my most highly anticipated films. ""Chocolate"" (a Thai action flick) and ""The Machine Girl"" were both insanely entertaining. I have full confidence that ""Tokyo Gore Police"" will be something really, really special. And maybe ""High School Girl Rika: Zombie Hunter"", ""Negative Happy Chainsaw Edge"", and ""Onechanbara"" can round out a great 2008 for Japanese Horror.

3391626,3,B0016K76V4,"This is the story of Ami Hyuga, the older sister of Yu Hyuga. They're all each other has as their parents committed suicide after being suspected of committing murder. When Yu starts being bullied by Sho, whose father is part of the yakuza, and his gang...things start to get ugly. Yu is told to bring Sho insane amounts of money or else Sho will go after Ami to put her in his father's whorehouse. Takeshi, a friend of Yu's, is on the same boat and when they don't pay the gang one day...they pay the consequences. Now, with Yu gone, Ami swears revenge. She winds up at Sho's house and tries to avenge her brother's death, but winds up getting captured...and loses an arm in the process. After she escapes, she manages to make it back to Takeshi's house. His parents wind up helping her and Takeshi's father makes it his responsibility to make her a machine gun for an arm. Thus Machine Girl is born.

I went into this with not necessarily high expectations, but I had been looking forward to it since I'd been keeping up with trailers and clips when they were released. It looked ridiculous and like it was going to be a lot of fun. The problem though was that I feel like I wound up biting off more than I could chew. The film was ridiculous, but way more than I was expecting. This movie is over the top in every sense of the phrase. The gore is outlandish, the acting is overdone, and the storyline is completely ridiculous. I went in wanting this to be a fun gore fest and walked out with an unexpected helping or two of cheese.

Machine Girl isn't completely horrible. It's still pretty entertaining. While the acting is overdone, it's pretty humorous at times. The fact that blood sprays in every direction for several minutes in just about every other scene in the film is entertaining in itself. There are several scenes in the film that are so over the top and so ludicrous that you can't help but laugh.

If you don't take this film too seriously, you may have some fun with it. It's like they knew ahead of time that this film couldn't be serious and took full advantage of it while they were making it. The movie is worth watching for some of the fight scenes alone as they're some of the bloodiest I've ever seen.",1212105600,3,2228,4.402912621359223

3391654,3,B0016K76V4,"What can I say? I am a fan if Japanese Cinema Sci-Fi and Action/Adventure, but not really anime. This movie is one of the ultra-violent female based action flicks coming out of Japan classified as ""Pink-Horror"" or ""Pink-Violence"". It really put me in the mind of watching a live action Anime movie that's kind of a cross between RoboCop and Planet Terror shot by John Waters. If you like that stuff then go ahead and buy it, but in my opinion there are better movies out there in this genre. I could only give this movie 3 stars.

I think the movie falls short because it takes itself so seriously, that it kills any fun to be had. Even the ultra-violent Robocop had a sense of humor, which this movie appears to lack. Here's two examples where this movie went off the tracks for me:

---Half Spoiler---
There are two scenes where the heroine encounters kill crazy mothers of her enemies. I feel the movie completely derailed in both of the scenes.
1) The kitchen ""Tempura"" scene. Over the top and played completely deadly serious. Huh? It had to be comedy, especially with the end result, but it is not portrayed that way.
2) In the ultimate battle at the end, the weapon the Yakuza mother uses is completely ridiculous, yet again they try to portray it with absolute seriousness.
Both times I just sat there and thought ""What the heck am I watching?"" I didn't laugh, and I certainly wasn't scared. I guess I was just kind of confused. They just completely lost me. Could be me.
---end half spoiler---

A lot of this movie was shot in a grainy film noire aspect that I feel did not come over well in High Definition it looked worse trhan an upscaled DVD. So in my opinion, if you want this movie, just skip the Blu-Ray and get the DVD. There is an extra disk that came with in Blu-Ray package with a few short films on it. If you really want that, then get the Blu-Ray I guess, but I feel like I wasted the money.

Personally, and I know I am going to catch hell for this, I thought the Blu-Ray of ""Robo Geisha"" was much more appropriate. The bright vibrant colors and clear High Def picture were well worth the extra money. It is also a movie that does not take itself too seriously, (it more than embraces the silly) so I enjoyed it a lot more.

With a flagship title such as this (which i would assume since they made limited steelbook)you really ought to treat the Blu-ray with extra care.  A pristine VHS copy will not pass for 1080p.  I did have the bareboned DVD, so this copy is an upgrade - though previous complaints of aliasing and banding are true, no extra clearity or even color are present.

3391657,3,B0016K76V4,"Just to throw this out there - Tokyo Shock either needs to step it up, or get out of the Blu-Ray business.

Their latest effort, Machine Girl, hits Blu-Ray with a number of problems.

Let me start off by saying I really like the movie. It's an over-the-top, low-budget, Japanese action/comedy film. Similar to movies like Riki-Oh, Vampire girl vs. Frankenstein girl, Tokyo Gore Police, Mutant Girls' Squad and a number of other titles). Very gory, but very entertaining! The other reviews should give you an idea of what to expect - or just pull up the trailer. You should be able to tell if it's ""for you"" or not. My 3 star-rating is for the BLU-RAY, not the movie.

Anyways, I bought the original DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machine-Girl/dp/B0016K76V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machine Girl</a>

...Then a couple months later they released a 2-disc DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Machine-Girl/dp/B0029Z8KCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Machine Girl</a>&nbsp;Remix -- I bought that too!

A few months after that, they had the nerve to release a 3-disc DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Machine-Girl-Collectors-Tin-3pc-Ws/dp/B00393SG2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Machine Girl: Collectors Tin (3pc) (Ws)</a>&nbsp;- I even bought that one.

4 days later, they announce the Blu-Ray.

Being a sucker for the movie, and having already bought it 3 times (what harm is a 4th time??) - I bit.

A little back information here - in addition to Tokyo Shock's need to re-release movies multiple times with little differences (in the above cases, the 2 disc set was the same as the original Disc 1, but with an added short film (20 minutes) on disc 2. The 3 disc set were the previous 2 discs and a 3rd with some extras), they put very little effort into their blu-rays (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ichi-the-Killer-Blu-ray/dp/B001OBBR42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ichi the Killer [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Gore-Police-Blu-ray/dp/B004L49JYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Gore Police [Blu-ray</a>] ).

Knowing this, I decided to give them a chance.

Problem #1:

The case states ""2X DISC SET"" - much like with the Tokyo Gore Police Blu-Ray, this is just an error (?) as there is only 1 disc inside. Don't get excited thinking they put all the extras onto 1 disc either, as you'd be mistaken.

The back of the case lists:
* Special features DVD with interviews and promo events
* Machine Girl Lite feature
* Behind the scenes of Machine Girl
* Original Trailer

The ""Special features DVD with interviews and promo events"" is what's missing. This sounds like the 3rd DVD from the 'Ultimate Machine Girl' set above. No big deal for me since I own it, but it would have definitely bumped up my review (as this Blu-Ray is 1/3rd the price of the Ultimate DVD).

On the bright side, it does have the Machine Girl Lite short film (~20 minutes). All the extras are in 480i, not HD.

Audio is in either DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 or 5.1 (and English or Japanese) - I can't comment on it as I don't have a DTS-HD MA system, but the bitrates appear to be around 1.2 - 1.6 mbps throughout. Don't expect much though.

The video is probably one of the worst looking Blu-Rays out there. Not faulting Tokyo Shock completely on this one (as these are generally low-budget films), but it doesn't even seem High-Definition. There are jagged lines through (aliasing problems), terrible video noise, banding, and it's all noticeable from a distance away (I saw about 8 feet from a 50"" TV and could easily see it). The flickering during motion scenes was the worst. The video was also uneven, looking good in some scenes, horrible in others. Probably an issue with brightness (indoors/outdoors).

In the end, this is basically the MACHINE GIRL DVD + MACHINE GIRL REMIX DVD, on a Blu-Ray disc. This Blu-Ray is (currently..) cheaper than the regular DVDs, and for that it's probably worth buying. It can regularly be found for 10-12 dollars, which isn't bad. I wouldn't pay much more though.

Long story short -

If you own a previous DVD, PASS on this one.
If you don't own it, but are interested, go for the Blu-Ray.

If the missing extras (and nice Steelbook case) are important to you, go for the (very expensive) Ultimate Edition 3-disc DVD.",1303948800,17,4511,5.500723589001447

Splatter specialist Yoshihiro Nishimura puts on another vulgar display of missing limbs, exploding heads, and other absurd gags that use everything from chainsaws to drill bras. The film's bloody revenge plot shares much more in common with the Japanese grindhouse classics like LONE WOLF AND CUB or LADY SNOWBLOOD rather than the more recent gorefests, although they each contain plenty of high-powered action sequences and geysers of blood. The acting and storyline here are also taken slightly more seriously than the other films of its kind despite its lighter tone. MACHINE GIRL's endless brutality and off-the-wall humor make it a must-see for hardcore gore fans!

3391663,4,B0016K76V4,"Machine Girl (Kataude mashin gru): 7 out of 10: People in Japan must have very high blood pressure. They don't bleed in Machine Girl, as much as they outright gush gallons of the red stuff. The effect is so over the top it adds a sense of outrageous humor to what could have been a fairly grim affair. After all the story concerns a college girl who gets a prosthetic weapon attached to her elbow after a member of the Yakuza amputates her lower arm to disused her from investigating the suiciding of her younger brother.

This quick synopsis actually understates the depravity our heroine undergoes before she gets all Death Wish on anyone with a shiny business suit.

Our Rick Allenesqe heroine is played by the delightful and delicious Japanese model/actress Minase Yashiro. In fact one of the movies strong points is a quite attractive cast wearing schoolgirl outfits and camo like some cosplayers wet dream. Mono-named Asami and Honoka join Yashiro to round out the attractive female cast.

Machine Girl however never really hooks the viewer emotionally. It is all so over the top and cartoonish. Exploitation films often benefit from allowing the audience to get emotionally involved with the characters (Think Mad Max or Savage Streets). I don't blame the actresses in this case; I simply think the script could have taken a breather from the silliness to add some much needed poignancy.

The entire film plays like an overlong Monty Python skit. It has great set pieces, decent special effects and enough fetish material to keep a Chaku-ero fan in his basement for a week. It simply doesn't tell a compelling story, nor does it allow one to become attached to any of the characters involved.

That said however, I simply cannot dislike a film that features a bra made out of industrial drills. So turn you mind off, send the misses out shopping and enjoy.",1266537600,,1863,4.809375

Noboru Iguchi directed this film and he did a good job. A young girl named Ami has the responsibility of taking care of her younger brother after a tragic suicide by her parents. What she doesn't know is that her brother is in debt to a yakuza members son. When her brother and his friend mysteriously dies (by way of suicide to some) she goes looking for answers. After a brave attempt she loses her arm but she is found by the friends mother and is revived. Now it's time for strike two.

Plot Rating

I've done some revenge reviews before but this one is incredibly fun. With the great fight scenes and wonderful technology that the bad guys are wielding. (drill braw) my favorite thing. This movie has a lot going for it not so much for how it was shot but because of the fun atmosphere it carries. They definitely knew they were making an over the top film with lots of blood. I give this plot a 7 out of 10.

Actors/Actresses

For Minase Yashiro this is her first film and she carries the movie. She goes from being a cute school girl to a tough ass kicking gun-slinging death machine who will stop at nothing to find her brothers killer. Although this part might type cast her to be in more over the top type movies. Ami plays Miki and she's a tough angry woman. She doesn't let anything stop her even when she's got swords in her chest. Although Miki has more experience than Yashiro it doesn't show and they worked well off of each other. The acting gets a 7 out of 10.

DVD Extras

Tokyo Shock bring us this lovely video and we get a behind the scenes look with interviews by some of the actors and actresses that were in the film. There's the original trailer for the film. There is also a Trailers button in the main menu where you get to take a look at four films. Although there were some extras I would have liked to see an interview done with the Director. I give these extras a 6 out of 10.

Personal Thoughts

This movie is (although I've said it before) an over the top blood fest. I mean there's more blood in Tokyo Gore Police but this movie is a hard act to follow with all the blood going on here. The acting is good for a movie that is suppose to be a little funny. (Tempura arm) that is so great.

This movie altogether gets a 20 out of 30. I highly recommend this movie to any asian scifi fans or someone who is a fan of asian cinema or if your looking for some fun martial arts, gun blasting heads off, drill braw action.",1265846400,,2458,4.2106382978723405

In the process she loses her arm, and has it replaced with an ultra heavy-duty machine gun!  Alongside her is Miki (Asami), whose son was a victim to said Yakuza as well; and both plot a path of bloody revenge.  Filled with some deliberately over the top cheesey moments to correlate with the massive amounts blood-letting and limb chopping, The Machine Girl is definitely not something meant for all tastes, but if any of this sounds appealing to you in the least, then this is something that you should definitely see to believe.

He sits down in a dark room under a low-watt light bulb, and with each entry he throws his head back and cackles. His parents can hear him from upstairs and they wonder...

Hee emerges weeks later with The Machine Girl.  He pushes a red button, and his minions come cowering into the room. He pitches the idea, and they nod fervently, drooling with approval. Iguchi then orders them away and to come back with a plot synopsis. They scurry off.

One of them comes back with this: ""Ami is a tough but otherwise average high school girl, trying to lead a normal life. Her world comes crashing down when her brother and his friend are killed by ruthless bullies.""

Iguchi slams his hand on the table, unsheathes a sword that we weren't aware of until now, and then separates the fool's head from his shoulders. The other minion recoil in fear. Iguchi demands a new synopsis.

I, yes I, emerge. With this: ""Girl with a half arm, attaches a Gatling gun to her stump and goes ballistic on a gang lord family. Cough syrup squirts from every human orifice.""

Iguchi raises his sword, but I have already ran off. I did not stick around to see him lick the goulash residue from his sword, smiling in approval. ""Exceeellleent"" he sez with a demonic grin.

3391685,4,B0016K76V4,"For the most part I've tried to write here about mainstream DVDs being released. On occasion I've chosen to let you know about other films making their way to direct DVD release. Today let's look at something else. Movies that never see release in the US (or at best limited release) that find their way to DVD. The subject in question is THE MACHINE GIRL.

For anyone unfamiliar with the latest trend in Japanese films, it's not the horror films being remade non-stop. Instead, it's a gore drenched action adventure films that are over the top in their depictions and filled with blood soaked humor. When someone gets cut, they don't bleed, they gush fountains of blood literally.

THE MACHINE GIRL starts out with action from the get go. When a group of young punks attack an innocent pair of school kids, a lone girl dressed in school uniform dress comes to their aid. This is no ordinary girl though. This is Ami and she is on a mission to seek revenge against this very gang for destroying her family.

The battle kicks off in high flying ninja-martial arts style, fist to fist. But all changes when Ami reveals that she's missing an arm. A quick pop into her school backpack, and she's now sporting a gattling gun where the lost appendage would normally be. And she knows how to use said gun as she begins cutting her way through bad guys, splitting one right down the middle.

The story moves to flashback where we learn how it all began. Ami and her brother live on their own, their parents having been killed. Her brother is picked on by the local teen gang led by the son of a Yakuza (think Japanese Mafia) boss. When her brother and his best friend are killed by the gang,

Ami tries to get the help of a local law enforcement official who turns out to be the father of one of the gang members. The mother attacks Ami, forcing her hand and arm down into a boiling pot of tempura being cooked, resulting in a terribly burnt arm covered in the batter. Barely escaping, Ami sets out to get revenge the old fashioned way.

Too bad because the Yakuza boss captures her in his house and rather than atone for his son's actions, applauds them and tortures Ami, finally cutting off her arm in a garden hose type squirting sequence that is so far over the top you find yourself thinking ""Where do they come up with this stuff?""

Ami escapes and with the help of the mother of her brother's best friend, a mechanic, is outfitted with the afore mentioned gattling type machine gun for an arm. When the Yakuza turns up to catch her once more, Ami opens fire and takes out the highly trained ninja's who attack, leaving them a bloody pulp.

Subsequent revenge attacks on the rest of the gang, leads to their parents forming themselves into a combat outfit supplied by the Yakuza boss to take on Ami and the mechanic mom. The final blood gorged battle between them makes for one of the goriest sequences ever filmed.

So is the film entertaining? Yeah, it is. As I said, it's so far over the top as to be cartoonish in the gore and blood flow. The ultra violent world of Japanese anime goes further than this film, so it's little more than one of those cartoons come to life.

If you laugh at absurd extremism then this film should have you falling on the floor laughing. If you have a more subdued taste or find gore not to your liking then by all means pass this one by. And if you're just kind of curious to see what other cultures do when they make movies in their native tongue, then give this one a try. Afterwards you might even be ready to take on OLDBOY, another over the top violent flick that's become a cult fave among DVD owners.

It's not for everyone, but this film does offer something new, something fresh, something different. If that sounds interesting to you, give this one a look.",1222128000,,3798,4.434720229555237
3391686,2,B0016K76V4,"""The Machine Girl"" follows the story of bloody revenge of Ami, an ordinary Japanese high school girl whose brother is killed by a spoiled son of a ninja clan. Or was that yakuza, Japanese mafia? Never mind. One-armed Ami fights ferociously with a machinegun attached to the left arm. She kills like Rambo (of the newest film), fighting the evil crime syndicate Hattori. The resourceful Hattori clan fights back with flying daggers and a flying guillotine. Oh, and don't forget a bra. Yes, a bra can be very dangerous.

Some may think director Noboru Iguchi's film ""Kataude Mashin Garu"" (literally translated ""One-Armed Machine Girl"") is Japan's answer to ""Kill Bill"" or ""Grindhouse"" and numerous exploitation films that have inspired the Tarantino-Rodriguez film, especially Rodriguez segment of ""Grindhouse."" However, ""The Machine Girl"" (which is actually produced by an American company, shot with all-Japanese cast in Japan) lacks the high-octane energy and crazy fun Rodriguez is known for. ""The Machine Girl"" is funny and entertaining, but only sporadically.

I think I know what the director is trying to do. He is obviously more attracted to old-fashioned Japanese films and TV shows. The ruthless wife of the Hattori Clan's boss is a nod to Japanese yakuza films; the three ninja-like assassins in red suit are parody of Japanese ""sentai"" (fighters) actions, still popular genre in Japan; and the heroine's story (and tortures) is probably inspired by the Japanese revenge drama in the 70s like ""The Female Prisoner 701: Scorpion"" (starring Meiko Kaji, inspiration of the Uma Thurman character in ""Kill Bill""). Some of the cast are good, some just amateurs. Minase Yashiro, known as gravure idol (model), did a fine job as the cute heroine that tunes into a killing machine. But something is missing here.

The film's biggest problem for me is not its excessive gores; it is the way they are used. As the film provides lots of blood, body count rises, but the pace is sluggish and deaths look repetitious. Except some nice gadgets, the film offers nothing new. Sloppy editing sometimes ruins the action scenes that could have been better with faster pace. Also, dialogues are not the best kind even in original Japanese and jokes including sushi and tempura are not very funny.

Perhaps ""The Machine Girl"" could be better with shorter running time. Not a big success, not a big disappointment either.",1221004800,3,2408,5.0886075949367084

the decaptations, the horizontal & vertical mutilations,
the showers of blood together.
We had so many romantic dinners, like the fried arm, and the finger sushi.
Remember that knife through that womans mouth,
oh what a joy to see her vomit blood on her sons decapitated head.
We had some good times didn't we??
Don't get me wrong every special effect we had was as corny as ""he who walks behind the rows"".
But they were fun weren't they.
Don't you recall??
Pounding nails in our enemies face,
the chainsaw leg, the flying guillotine, and the motorized drill bra.
I can't believe our bloody, slow-mo, skull-swapping conclusion.
It was all to sudden.
Come back to me Machine Girl,
I love you,
I need to feel your waves of blood on my face again.
You fill my world with gore.

It's been a week since I watched this movie, and still the only word I can come up with to describe it is WHAT. Machine Girl is... something different, that's for sure. A spoof of action/horror movies that's never quite over-the-top enough to tip you off that the director isn't taking it seriously, a camp classic where the acting isn't quite truly bad enough to qualify, a special-effects extravaganza where the special effects are just fake enough to let you know it's not a special-effects extravaganza... you get the idea. If it wanted to be all those things and fell just short, it's as massive a failure of a movie as I've seen in years. If, however, it's supposed to be that way, it's genius.

So anyway, there's not a great deal of plot here. No surprise. Ami (porn actress Asami) is a schoolgirl whose brother is killed by bullies, one of whom is the son of the local Yakuza branch. When she tries to get revenge, she loses her left arm. She teams up with Miki (softcore actress Honoka), the mother of one of Ami's brother's friends who was also killed in the attack, and Miki teaches Ami martial arts while her husband makes Ami a machine-gun arm. And, well, you can guess what happens from there.

Machine Girl is nothing more than stupid fun, and if you go into it with that attitude, you'll have a good time. It's not meant to be deathless cinema (at least, I don't think it is), just a fun time you can use to while away ninety minutes. And in that vein, it's great stuff-- cheesy dialogue, over-the-top painfully fake gore, lots of one-liners. If you're looking for great moviemaking, look elsewhere, but I think most folks would have a lot of fun with this one. ***",1216339200,,1718,4.535483870967742

3391700,4,B0016K76V4,"My short review would be Machine Girl is awesome! Unfortunately short reviews are for punks so I gotta keep going.

Machine Girl stars Minase Yashiro as Ami, a pretty high schooler who's a bit of a tomboy. Ami cares for her younger brother Yu since their parents committed suicide after a supposed murder frame up leaving the kids to fend for themselves.

Amis brother and his best friend Takashi are killed by an extorting bully who is also the son of a Yakuza Ninja couple who are a few rice balls short of a bento box.
Of course the only way for a young girl to get justice is to seek revenge on the boys who killed her brother. Maybe that murder frame up in her families past wasn't such a frame up since Ami seems really quick to turn to homicidal tendencies. Even her brother had a list in his diary of people he wanted to kill, which leads Ami in her schoolgirl uniform to her first violent confrontation with a family of one of her brothers killers.

I don't think I'm giving anything away by revealing Ami eventually loses an arm in her quest for bloody vengeance. This leads to an alliance with Takashis mechanic parents. Miki, excellently played by Japanese AV star Asami, takes her under her wing and trains Ami to fight while Sugeru, the father, constructs a machine gun arm to replace Ami's missing limb.

There is one other star of this film. Arterial spray. This flick shoots as much of the red stuff as any Lone Wolf and Cub film. Doesn't matter if you lose a finger or get stabbed in the head. Blood will spurt in unbelievable amounts. Half the film seems to be filmed in a pink mist, and that's fine by me. I haven't seen exaggerated maiming like this since the classic Story Of Ricky-O. As outrageous as Ricky-O was, the violence seems even stronger when it centers around a beautiful girl with an amazing smile.

I gotta tell you. Guy or gal, if you don't fall in love with the screen combo of Ami and Miki then your tastes probably run to the ultra fetishist or non human since both women are gorgeous, tough and sexy.

There are so many high points to this film. The Red Junior High School Ninjas, the Super Mourners Gang comprised of parents of boys Ami has taken revenge on. A chainsaw leg and a drill bra, I'll wait for that one to sink in, A Drill BRA rounding out the mechanics of destruction. Finger sushi, face nailing, the list goes on and on!

Machine Girl is a near perfect modern revenge flick. It is thoroughly entertaining and never takes itself too seriously. Of course if you don't like gore for gores sake, you may want to skip this one. I recommend putting the kids to sleep, getting some friends over and creating a drinking game based on this film and the copious amount of bloodletting. You'll be drunk before the credits roll.

Machine Girl moves into my top list of films to join such classics as Shaun and Dawn of the Dead, Battle Royale and Kill Bill to name a few.",1215043200,,2912,4.409683426443203

A very exciting, highly exaggerated revenge story with twisted humour that's sure not to bore.",1214524800,,453,4.896103896103896

I insist on rating this movie because I think the more this movie catches on the more movie snobs will bash this film due to ""overacting"" or the ""lack of plot"" and so on.  Of course every character in here extremely overacts.  Absolutely there isn't much of a plot at all.  It's a typical revenge tale.  A young girls brother gets killed by a gang.  She gets pissed.  She gets her arm chopped off by said gang.  She gets more pissed.  She gets a gun.  She kills them.  Sorry to spoil it for you.  Not much to it I know.  But who cares?  It's fun!  Bloody Bloody Fun!

But make no mistake, this is one of the most hysterically good times a gorehound can have with a single DVD.

Blood covers the screen, the heroines, the villains, the floor, and everything else in this film, sometimes to the point where it's all you can see.  Fingers are made into sushi, an arm is battered and deep-fried, a woman discovers her son's head in her soup and then vomits as she is stabbed through the mouth from behind, her blood mixing with the extra-chunky puke to pour enticingly onto her son's disembodied head in the bowl in front of her (OWNED!), and that's before the giant machine-gun arm comes in!

Get ready to laugh yourself sick...or maybe just get sick.  Either way, this is one of the giddiest, most profanely violent, and cheesiest grindhouse films I've ever seen.  It even comes complete with a score that could have come straight out of a 70's exploitation flick.  Consider my faith in Japanese cinema officially restored.  This is what I want to see when I pick up a movie with a DVD cover like this one's: a Japanese schoolgirl with a ridiculous machine gun arm blow a hole in a guy and then stick the gun through the hole she just shot in the guy to shoot a hole in another guy's face.  Is that too much to ask?  Director Iguchi Noboru says ""HELL NO!"".  And God bless him for that.

3391705,3,B0016K76V4,"Machine Girl is a film that seeks to be every type of cult japanese film that it can be in its short running time all wrapped up in a big bow of exploitation. Theres the revenge quotient, some chanbara action with yakuza and wrapped up with a bunch of other stuff I'm too meak to categorize. Its main distributor Nikkatsu is known for producing mainly exploitation films and really the film isn't very serious and silly at the most. But what more can you think when a movies villains aren't only Yakuza but descendants of the Ninja Hattori Hanzo. Despite the glowing sense of stupidity that permeates the whole thing I was wearing a big stupid grin on my face through the whole mess of a film.

Ami is a likeable college student good at basketball who takes care of her younger brother Yu. Of course in the opening minutes we learn that Yu is being bullied and unfortunately tries to fight back. This unfortunately leads to him a friend being thrown to their deaths. Ami trying hard to do the right thing finds herself assaulted by the family she confronts (having her hand fried as tempura but thats not what necesitates the machine gun arm). She then goes into revenge mode and everything goes further into crazy territory as Ami looses her arm and after teaming up with the parents of the Yu's murdered friend gains a gatling gun for an arm. But that doesn't even begin to describe things like a drill bra, a high school ninja assassin team and some reaonably well done gore.

I find it hard to really defend or critique a film this ridiculous. The acting is bland and straight out of the b-movie quality it should be. The gore is too obvious and over the top but once they showed a screaming head with its face torn off any idea that they might have been aiming for realism vanished (and was never there to begin with). And the villains were so overdone but funny in their own little way (not including a crooked police man and his laughing wife, the main villains feed someone his fingers as his sushi and induce their bodygaurds to necrophilia with odd reasoning). This isn't a serious film and its not meant to be. It doesn't reach the heights of some more the insane classics from Japan but with a cheap price tag its at least worth checking out for those interested.",1213660800,,2275,4.492753623188406
3391706,2,B0016K76V4,"""Tongue in cheek - funny"".  I mean, you gotta be kidding me.  Are Japanese people really entertained by these kinds of violent films?  Very bad special effects and totally unlikable people?  You would think that when people get cut or lose a limb, they would just bleed.  But no, in Japanese films, people spray blood just like having a fire hydrant burst open.  It's so ridiculous looking that it's funny.  I've heard of being under stress, but these films give ""being under pressure"" a whole new meaning.  Jeez, I'd imagine that have some pretty intense farts too.

This is like a totally, bloody, gory, film with ""over the top"" exaggerated sarcastic evil with a wealthy family that definitely has social problems.  Even their son is dressed to be an evil effeminate pansy if I've ever seen one so, of course, you'd want to see him blown away in the end.  Everyone's kinda sick in this movie.  I didn't think that Japanese audiences were this warped with what entertains them.",1213401600,4,978,4.72189349112426
3391707,4,B0016K76V4,"MACHINE GIRL (aka. One-Armed Machine Girl)  is an over-the-top, campy, ultra-violent action film by Iguchi Noboru (Sukeban Boy). The film is definitely NOT for everyone but will appeal to fans of Japanese cult films with a touch of dark comedy and unrealistic ultra-bloody violence made popular by Ichi the Killer and even Tarantino's magnificent ""Kill Bill"". Folks will either applaud or be repulsed by this film's execution, but it is a wickedly twisted, darkly-toned entertainment that knows exactly what it's going for. The film features well-known Japanese bikini model Minase Yashiro in her first feature role, ex-AV star Asami and the beautiful Honoka as the Yakuza boss' twisted wife. Do I have your attention yet?

Plot synopsis partly derived from the back cover:
Ami (Minase Yashiro) is a tough but otherwise average high school girl, trying to lead a normal life with her younger brother. Her whole world comes crushing down when her brother and his friend are killed by ruthless bullies led by a Yakuza Boss' son. When she goes to find those responsible, she finds herself in over her head and minus her left arm. Barely surviving, Ami escapes and finds shelter from a kindly mechanic and his wife Miki (Asami) who also happen to be the parents of her brother`s friend. They take pity on Ami's plight, helping her heal, training her and fitting her with a powerful machine gun where her left arm used to be. She then teams up with the tough mother to seek vengeance and together they unleash an unholy, non-stop, over the top kill fest against the equally creative machinery of their ruthless Ninja-Yakuza enemies.

The film is a wild blend of 70's ""pink violence"" and 80's super-violent splatter horror that doesn't take itself seriously. The film is full of bloody sequences and oddball weird humor that will undoubtedly garner a cult following. It was quite inventive of the filmmakers to rely on ""old-school"" style violence to conduct the visual blood and gore. Whether this decision was made because of budget constraints or some other factor, it made the film work; from an entertainment standpoint kind of way. The exaggerated gallons of blood complements the film's action sequences; chainsaw-fu, machine gun-fu, swordplay and brassiere-fu are the film's many unorthodox style of brutality. The film is an example of an adult-Tokusatsu (Kid's TV show)with the wild blend of action, camp, humor, sci-fi and even horror that plays like a stunt/Gore show.

The film also has some campy ideas that will make you say; ""What the heck"" as the film makes fun of certain anime-inspired names such as ""Super Mourner Gang"" and ""Junior high Shuriken gang"" seem attempts to somewhat tone down all the violence and brutality displayed. There are also twisted touches of oddball humor with the ""sushi fingers"" and ""tempura arm"".  I've always wondered how Hellraiser's ""Pinhead"" got that look; Miki and Ami were very obliged to demonstrate how that sinister look can come about in a human being.

Sexy Minase Yashiro plays the lead, I'm a little undecided as to how well her first starring performance is. She has the right school girl look and she has a lot of charisma, but at times she looks a little awkward with the action sequences. Asami plays Miki and she looks a little young and definitely too cool to be the mother of a teenager. Nude model Honoka adds a lot of eye-candy as the wife of Yakuza boss Kimura. The woman is twisted in her own way, she has that no-nonsense appeal further accentuated by Honoka's sheer sexiness. She is seductively, yet creepily appealing as she displays her ""Drill Brassiere"" as an added campy display of villainy. Shimazu Kentaro is the Yakuza Boss who seemed to have been based on ""Heihachi Yashima"" from the ""tekken"" video game. The whirling and hurling flying razor sharp ""bucket"" adds more to the film's twistedly, campy appeal. Boss Kimura an intimidating villain although he isn't an originally fresh concept.

With Ami's Sailor Moon-inspired outfit, sentai/tokusatsu heroism, references to ninja and Yakuza elements, the film is definitely aimed at anime fan boys and those very initiated with Japanese cinema. The film's enjoyment requires a very large suspension of disbelief for its entirety. Take two cups of ""Shoot `Em Up"", three tablespoons of ""Darkman"" and even ""Planet Terror"" to two gallons of ""Ichi The Killer"" and stir vigorously, then you will have an accurate idea just how this film plays out. The film doesn't take itself seriously and if ""Machine Girl"" is any indication of the filmmakers take on twisted entertainment, then I'm sold to see ""Tokyo Gore Police"".
