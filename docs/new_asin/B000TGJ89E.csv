2898039,4,B000TGJ89E,"For fans of Peter Cushing you are in for a treat with these 3 fine horror movies from Amicus studios. He does not star as the lead but is great as a supporting character in all 3 movies.
And Now the Screaming Starts is my favorite and well worth watching the commentary is excellent.
Asylum is the next best and is an anthology it has several stories and Cushing gives a fine performance.
Last on is the Beast Must Die. This is the weakest but still has some good moments. It is also fun to watch all those early 70'sstyles and one has to watch for a young Micheal Gambon in an early role.
The stories are entertaining and the acting is uniformly top notch. And watching Peter Cushing in anything is worth it.",1320451200,4,709,4.298507462686567

2898041,4,B000TGJ89E,"These three movies are relentlessly on American Movie Classics on cable.  As if AMC only has the license to show these, as opposed to the vast amount of Hammer films, which are infinitely better.  Asylum and Now the Screaming ..., are good, not great.",1262217600,4,251,4.681818181818182
2898042,5,B000TGJ89E,"If you're not familiar with Amicus studios, you will be after watching the three films in this superb collection:  ""Asylum,"" ""And Now the Screaming Starts!"" and ""The Beast Must Die.""  Amicus was a British film studio famous for releasing horror films in the sixties and seventies.  It was Hammer studios' number one competitor.  Whereas Hammer was famous for its historical gothic horror (e.g., the Frankenstein and Dracula series), Amicus was famous for its horror anthologies.

  Perhaps one of the most famous of the anthologies that Amicus released is the chilling ""Asylum.""  Based on short stories written by ""Psycho"" author Robert Bloch, this film begins with a young doctor applying for a position at an insane asylum.  He must interview four patients; each one relates their ghastly experience that caused them to be incarcerated.  Voodoo, witchcraft, and drugs bring forth some of our worst nightmares.  Dismembered limbs seek revenge, a mannequin comes to life, and a man's soul is transferred into a doll that murders.  A good body count, plenty of suspense, and a shocking ending make ""Asylum"" enjoyable viewing.

  ""The Beast Must Die"" is contemporary horror.  What distinguished this one from most of its contemporaries?  The lead actor was controversially played by a black man, Calvin Lockhart.  The film bordered on blaxploitation.  Lockhart is Tom Newcliff, a type of ""Shaft"" character who is a self-made millionaire and big game hunter; he invites to his secluded home a group of strangers - one of whom is a werewolf.  There is plenty of action as one by one the strangers are killed until the identity of the werewolf is revealed.  There are a few shocking twists to keep everyone guessing.

  ""And Now the Screaming Starts!"" is my personal favorite (and my reason for buying the collection) because I love historical gothic horror.  I've read that this is the only one produced by Amicus.  What a shame because it really is a great ghost story about a dismembered hand and an eyeless woodsman that terrorizes a wealthy couple on their wedding night.  Gorgeous Stephanie Beacham is Catherine Fenngriffen who is determined to learn the curse that has been placed on her husband's family.  One by one, friends and staff members die as they attempt to help her.  There is a shocking climax similar to the one in ""Rosemary's Baby.""

  Horror icon Peter Cushing co-stars in all three films.  He was a big star for Hammer Studios.  In fact, many of Hammer's actors and crew members worked on Amicus films.  Roy Ward Baker directed ""Asylum"" and ""And Now the Screaming Starts!""  He directed many Hammer films such as ""The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires,"" ""Quartermass and the Pit,""  and ""The Abominable Snowman.""  All three Amicus films were produced by Max J. Rosenberg (the money man) and Milton Subotsky (the idea man) who founded Amicus, which means ""friend.""

  Dark Sky Films did an excellent job of packaging and releasing this collection.  Each DVD has excellent commentaries, interviews, and liner notes that will explain in greater detail how Amicus studios came into existence and how each film was made.  There are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.  Each film can be seen in its beautiful widescreen theatrical presentation.

  ""The Amicus Collection"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy watching gothic horror (both contemporary and historical) that was made in the early seventies.  Each film is classic horror and represents a wonderful age in cinema that is long gone.  Amicus, famous for its anthologies, made many that are recommended viewing such as ""The Torture Garden,"" ""The House That Dripped Blood,"" ""From Beyond the Grave,"" ""Tales from the Crypt,"" and ""Vault of Horror.""",1232668800,47,3728,5.072607260726072
2898043,4,B000TGJ89E,"I thought I had seen all of the old horror movies, until I found these. I never heard of Amicus until recently.
It's not for gore hounds, or someone who can't appreciate old horror movies.
But if you're a fan of the old Hammer studio movies, then these Amicus movies might be worth checking out.",1229731200,7,295,4.381818181818182
2898044,2,B000TGJ89E,"I gotta tell you, anyone who screams at this DVD needs their head examined.

The stories, while entertaining, are so juvenile that I felt cheated after reading the reviews before buying it.

I have to wonder if the reviews are for real.

It's like a cross between Twilight Zone and some of the old, predictable Vincent Price movies.

If you are a collector of the macabre you might like it for the sake of viewing old movies.  However, scary?  It isn't.",1228694400,3,453,4.530864197530864
2898045,4,B000TGJ89E,"Amicus is a tad downmarket from Hammer Films, but like most underdogs, they try harder. The first film is Asylum, based on stories by Robert Bloch of Psycho fame, and boasts an admiral cast, even if most of them probably didn't work on the production for more than two days. Peter Cushing, Britt Eklund, Herbert Lom, Patrick Magee, Charlotte Rampling and Barbara Parkins are all on display here in a collection of horror shorts concerning trying to discover the head of the Asylum who, for reasons the plot sort of explains, is hiding among the wacky patients. Next comes The Beast Must Die, a combo werewolf/blaxploitation melange with Peter Cushing, Michael Gabon and the sorely missed Calvin Lockhart. Complete with a 30-second ""Werewolf Break"" just before the end of the film (for the audience to pick the werewolf), it's a strange entry. Stranger still is the final offering, And Now the Screaming Starts, with Herbert Lom and Peter Cushing, and a haunted mansion, loopy doctors and even naughty spirits to scare the bejesus out of us.",1226966400,19,1040,4.9147727272727275
2898046,5,B000TGJ89E,"Peter Cushing is my favorite actor, and his presence (whether top-billed or merely as a supporting player) elevates these films beyond their humble origins to the level of solid entertainment.

The transfers for ""Asylum"" and ""And Now..."" look very good on my 720p projection screen, and while the transfer of ""The Beast..."" isn't quite up to par, it is a welcome improvement over the Image disc released a decade ago.

The commentaries give a nuts-and-bolts view of British film-making of the 1970s without becoming too dry or technical for the uninitiated, and for that reason are not to be missed by the true cinephile.

I cant put my finger on it, but Amicus came off more edgy than Hammer. Producers Max Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky did a mighty fine job. I had the good fortune to see Asylum and The Screaming, at the drive-in about 40 years ago. Both those flicks directed by Roy Ward Baker.

8209104,4,B000TGJ89E,"This review is for the standard DVD edition of ""The Amicus Collection"" released by MPI Home Video in 2007. You get 3 movies.

The 3 discs are:

1 )Asylum
2) And Now The Screaming Starts
3) The Beast Must Die

PLOT/SUMMARY: A synopsis of each movie is as follows:

ASYLUM: This is an anthology movie that is broken in to 4 parts (sort of) with a framing story. The fourth part is incorporated into the framing story while the first 3 parts have a person telling a story.

Dr. Martin arrives at an asylum. He is there for a job interview. He has come looking for Dr. Starr, head of the asylum. When he arrives, Dr. Rutherford (Patrick Magee) tells him that Dr. Starr is now one of the patients. He says that Dr. Starr attacked him and that is the reason he is now in a wheelchair. Dr. Rutherford tells  Dr. Martin that pressing a button on his desk is the only way to get into or out of the area where the patients are kept. Both doctors agree that some people in this world so convincingly change their identities that it becomes very difficult to tell the difference from their real identity. This seems to be the case with Dr. Starr. He tells Dr. Martin that he will be hired if he can figure out which of the patients that are in the cell block is Dr. Starr. Dr. Martin agrees to the challenge. He sends Dr. Martin up to the cell area and instructs the orderly to give absolutely no information about the patients to Dr. Martin. Dr. Martin attempts to pull information out of him but the orderly is of no help. Dr. Martin visits 4 patients and there stories are as follows:

1) Frozen Fear: Bonnie is the mistress of Walter. Walter has married into wealth and the two have conspired to kill Walter's wife, Ruth.
2) The Weird Taylor: Bruno is an old tailor and is about to be evicted from his store for non-payment of rent. A mysterious customer (Peter Cushing) comes into his store with very specific instructions on how to make the suit and brings his own material. The instructions allow for the tailor to make the suit only in the late evening hours. He offers a large sum of money, more than enough for Bruno to pay his rent.
3) Lucy Comes to Stay: Barbara (Charlotte Rampling) is returning home from an asylum. She was sent away because of a drug addiction that caused her to hallucinate and create an imaginary friend, Lucy (Britt Ekland). Upon returning home she seeks out her hidden drugs and takes them.
4) Mannikins of Horror: This story takes place in the room of Dr. Byron (Herbert Lom). He makes mini-robots with the faces of people he knows. He tells Dr. Martin that they are alive and have the souls of the people they depict.

After his fourth interview, Dr. Martin heads downstairs and tells Dr. Rutherford that he is disgusted with the conditions of the asylum. Dr. Rutherford asks Dr. Martin for his choice.

AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS: In the 1700's, Charles Fengriffin (Ian Ogilvy) brings home his new bride, Catherine (Stephaine Beacham).
She immediately begins having visions of a bloody hand and an eyeless head. She gets pregnant shortly thereafter. Dr. Whittle (Patrick Magee) wants them to move away. Charles refuses. We don't know it yet but there has been a curse placed on the family by a woodsman. Silas is the son of another woodsman also named Silas. Silas has inherited the land from Charles' grandfather. Despite her efforts, nobody in the house will reveal to Catherine their reservations. People start dying and Catherine is losing her mind. She is afraid for her unborn child. She knows there is something amiss with Silas. Charles attempts to buy out Silas but he refuses.  Charles calls for a psychiatrist, Dr. Pope (Peter Cushing). Cushing attempts to help Catherine but is stifled by the house servants and  Charles himself. Finally, after Dr. Whittle's death, Charles relents and tells Dr. Pope about why Silas is on the land and refuses to leave. Catherine is due shortly to have their child.

THE BEAST MUST DIE: The movie opens with a black man, Tom Newcliffe being chased through woods (or a jungle). He appears to be being hunted by white men dressed in black outfits. We see a helicopter following him and we see camera's and microphones throughout the woods. Several times, Tom is caught but released. Finally he comes upon a mansion with a tea party going on outside. Tom is then shot by soldiers in front of the guests. They come rushing to his aid. Tom is in fact, not dead. He is a wealthy person who has contracted a company to build him a top notch security system that surrounds his property. He was merely testing the system. He has invited 5 guests to stay with him and his wife Caroline for a few days to figure out who is a werewolf. He is a hunter looking for the ultimate prize. Tom believes he has the 3 days of the full moon to figure out who is the werewolf.
The 5 guests are:

1) Arthur Bennington - a diplomat
2,3) Jan and Davina - A pianist and his wife
4) Paul Foote - an artist
5) Professor Lundgren (Peter Cushing) - an archaeologist who knows a lot about werewolves.

Also there is Pavel (Anton Diffring), head of the security team

They all join for dinner and Professor Lundgren gives a scientific explanation for werewolves along with the reason for silver being harmful.

The hunt is on. Near the end of the movie, there is a break in which you have to decide who you think is the werewolf.

COMMENTS/PRODUCTION:

ASYLUM: This is my favorite of the 3 movies.

""Asylum"" is written by famous author and screenwriter Robert Bloch of ""Psycho"" fame.

'Asylum' is also know as 'House of Crazies.'

The opening and end credits use the famous classical music, 'Night on Bald Mountain.'

All 4 patients had names starting with the letter 'B'(Barbara, Bruno, Bonnie, Byron). I'm not sure if this had any significance.

AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS: This was possibly the most expensive movie that Amicus ever made.

I felt that it is well done and felt that it was decent. It felt like a 'Hammer' movie to me. The ending was interesting but overall the movie was a bit sluggish.  I thought that they waited too long to tell the story of the 'curse'.

Peter Cushing gets top billing but doesn't show up until the second half of the movie. Herbert Lom is in basically one scene and gets second billing. Third star Patrick Magee is only in the first half of the movie. The main stars Stephanie Beacham and Ian Oglivy only get fourth billing! This was in keeping with Amicus' practice of hiring name stars for a short period of time.

Oakley House, the mansion used in this movie was used many times by Hammer productions.

THE BEAST MUST DIE: This movie moves quite slowly at times. I found it lacking.

The movie does not seem to have budgeted much for special effects. While viewing the extra's, I learned that one of the producers, Milton Subotsky, decided to spend more money on 'name' actors. He felt paying more for a good actor for a few days was more beneficial to his movies than anything else. The werewolf itself doesn't use any real make up. He is either a dog in disguise or a real life wolf.

The open of the movie invites you to try and figure out who is the werewolf. This adds a bit of interest and was clearly inspired by the marketing gimmicks of William Castle. The director was not thrilled with this. Milton Subotsky felt that this was a very poor movie and added the gimmick to try and save the movie.

I wasn't quite sure how Tom knew that one of his guests were a werewolf. He gives his reasons for each guest as to why they could be a werewolf. Why couldn't more than 1 be a werewolf? How did he get them to come to his house? These questions may have been answered, I just didn't pick up on it.

The movie attempts to give a scientific reason for the existence of werewolves. It even tries to give an explanation for 'silver' being fatal to werewolves. This is merely a trope that was invented by the writer of Universal's 'The Werewolf' and not a legendary device that has been passed down through the ages.

Robert Quarry (Count Yorga) was initally considered for the part of 'Tom' but was under contract to AIP. They decided to go with Calvin Lockhart, a black actor who was known for 'Blaxploitation' films. As a result this movie has also been released as 'Black Werewolf' but without the break to decide who is werewolf.

Michael Gambon who would go on to play Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series plays Jan, the pianist.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Whether or not you purchase this collection depends a lot upon whether you are a fan of
the time period and the price.

This collection is obviously meant for fans of Amicus films who most likely are fans of Hammer Productions. There are numerous extra's that focus on the productions at Amicus.

My ratings for each of the plots of the movies are as follows, Asylum - 4 stars, The Beast Must Die, 2 1/2 stars, And Now the Screaming Starts, 3 1/2 stars.

Overall I'm giving it 4 stars.",1516665600,2,8927,4.501237623762377
