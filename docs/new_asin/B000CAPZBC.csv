2454630,5,B000CAPZBC,I was both shocked and thrilled to see this film.  First time for a well produced film about the myth of Jesus Christ.  I believe it needs to be on public tv. And make a series out of it!,1129593600,32,187,3.769230769230769
2454631,3,B000CAPZBC,"In much the same way that very few right wing Republicans ever saw Moore's 911 film, few fundamentalist Christians will ever see this film. Which is unfortunate - everyone should challenge their faith from time to time. After being involved with bringing the Weekly World News' Batboy to off-Broadway glory, Flemming chose the logical next step for his career - making a film presenting evidence that Jesus was and is a fictional character. Much of Flemming's supporting source material has been around for decades (and usually centuries) though he presents numerous interviews with current scholars of varying prestige (from graduate students to respected university professors, though they all have books to sell). Flemming does not interview any scholars opposed to the Jesus-myth, save for the educated director of the fundamentalist Christian elementary school he attended as a child. Interestingly, it is this point that seems to be the underlying reason Flemming chose this project - to revisit his fundamentalist past and reaffirm his conversion to becoming an ""Atheist Christian"" as he calls himself in a Christianity Today interview. The DVD contains the film plus two full length commentary track interviews, exactly 66:06 minutes of extended interviews, and extensive slide show galleries with web content. Supporting documentation for the film's facts and quotes is rather limited, but as this is a DVD, there is hardly any way to include footnotes (the film's website does provide further supporting content though). Like all documentaries, the film manipulates its audience a bit, presenting a couple New Testament excerpts that seem to suggest that the Apostle Paul thought Jesus was never on earth (Hebrews 8:4, not written by Paul and presented in an unknown translation) and that Jesus wanted people killed in front of him (Luke 19:27 NIV, the last line spoken by a character in the parable of the three servants, not Jesus himself). The film does a much better job of presenting the ""Jesus myth"" as a parallel to other mythical heroes; the Oedipus and Dionysus myths for example have an abundance of similarities with the Biblical life of Christ and of course predate Jesus by centuries, so the scriptures would seem to be derivative of those myths. This argument is difficult to refute and Flemming presents the argument and common (though weak) refutations in a comical way. Overall, the film is entertaining but the sarcastic tone and content itself are unlikely to convert any fundamentalist evangelicals into raving atheists. On a final note, the trippy soundtrack is excellent and is freely available online, check it out.",1129248000,273,2648,5.247641509433962

2454634,1,B000CAPZBC,"Where to start..? First I want to say as a christian that I was shocked at how hard this man went to dispute Christianity. If you don't want to believe that's your choice. If you want to put your beliefs out there that's your choice. BUT.... Don't crap on what somebody else believes or try to stray people who are trying to begin to learn away from something that is going to bring goodness into their hearts. Putting up a picture of Charles Manson and saying he was a Christian just blew my mind. That statement made ALL CHRISTIANS look like crazy murderers. I've never killed or part took in any killings of any person ever. I'm sorry your experience was not what it should've been, really I am. I just hope that people don't watch this and dispute what soooooo many people know to be true. Faith IS believing without seeing. Don't watch this and lose faith. Watch this and see what kind of world we live in today. It breaks my heart. If this video did anything for me, it brought me closer to my God, My Jesus, everything I was taught and still believe in. I became a believer through the love of Christ not solely on the fact that people can and will go to hell. I will pray that videos like this will bring people closer to Jesus, closer to God, closer to the Holy Spirit.

2454636,3,B000CAPZBC,"The God Who Wasn't There suffers from a lot of issues.  The biggest issue is it doesn't provide either context or source material.

For example, Justin Martyr's quote of  When we say that Jesus Christ was produced without sexual union, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended to heaven, we propound nothing new or different from what you believe regarding those whom you call the sons of Jupiter. (First Apology [21:30]) is not put in the context of the Euhemerism so common back then.  Herodotus (c484425 BCE), the father of history, had argued that myths were distorted accounts of real historical events. Euhemerus (4th century - 3rd century BCE) took that idea and kicked it up to the next level suggesting that all myths had some basis in historical fact [81] ""The work is of immense importance, for Euhemerus proposes that myth is history in disguise, that deities were originally living men and women who were elevated to divine status because of heroic feats when alive."" (Neusner, Jacob; Alan Jeffery Avery-Peck (2007) Encyclopedia of religious and philosophical writings in late antiquity Brill, Page 369)

In fact, both Herodotus and Euhemerus stated that Zeus had actually been a mortal king (Euhemerus said Zeus was buried on Crete), Plutarch (c46  120 CE) sought to show that Osiris had been an actual ancient king of Egypt, and Eusebius in the 4th century CE accepted Heracles as a flesh and blood man who had been an Egyptian and been a king in Argos.

A far more interesting quote from Justin Marty is from his ""Dialogue with Trypho"" as it implies that people had doubts about Jesus existing even in his time: ""But Christ--if He has indeed been born, and exists anywhere--is unknown, and does not even know Himself, and has no power until Elias come to anoint Him, and make Him manifest to all. And you, having accepted a groundless report, invent a Christ for yourselves, and for his sake are inconsiderately perishing.""

Robert Price's comment about Jesus living in the time of Alexander Jannaeus is actually, well let's let Price speak for himself, ""attested in Epiphanius, the Talmud, and the Toledoth Jescji (dependent on second-century Jewish-Christian gospel), that Jesus was born about 100 BCE and was crucified under Alexander Jannaeus! "" Price, Robert (2003) Incredible Shrinking Son of Man pg 40)

Here is Epiphanius exact words on matter as cited by Christ Myther Mead in 1903 and Historical Jesus supporter Shirley Jackson Case in 1912:  ""For with the advent of the Christ, the succession of the princes from Judah, who reigned until the Christ Himself, ceased. The order [of succession] failed and stopped at the time when He was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, **in the days of Alexander [Jannaeus]**, who was of high-priestly and royal race""  More over the Teacher of Righteousness of the Dead Sea Scroll would seem to support the idea of a Messiah like figure in the 1st century BCE.  But by no giving where this is coming from Price leave the matter open to be turned into a strawman.

Worse, we don't get the fact that Irenaeus who claimed that Jesus had to be at least 46 if not 50 years old when he was crucified in Against Heresies  2;22:1-6 (which totally hoses the defacto 6 BCE -36 CE time frame for Jesus) but in Demonstrations 74 expressly states this happened under Herod ""King of the Jews"" (i.e. Herod Agrippa I) during the reign of Claudius Caesar or between 42-44 CE!  Irenaeus has Jesus being crucified AFTER Paul had his vision (no later then 37 CE)!

The horrible quality of the supporting material (Josephus, Pliny the Younger, Suetonius, Tacitus, and on a really bad day Thallus) is not even touched on.  Nor are real world examples of the lightning like speed a cult can seemingly create a non traceable founder as seen with John Frum and Ned Ludd presented to who why the non detestable reference of any of our Gospels before c 130 CE is important.

While not on the level of Zeitgeist which spews total nonsense this is not as good as it could have been.  My advice is to skip this and look for one of Richard Carrier's lectures on the Christ Myth that can be found on youtube.  You will definitely get more useful information for time spent.",1427328000,,4208,4.7699724517906334
2454637,5,B000CAPZBC,"While a little disjointed and amateurishly shot in places, The God Who Wasn't There easily ends any possibility for reasonable people that care about believing what is true to ever be able to by into or venerate any of the Biblical myths by way of showing irrefutable links between precursor myths, messiahs, commandments, and religions to the myths of Christianity and those links being impossibly similar in a way that illustrates that Christianity and the story of Jesus are just version 5.0 of the traditions and myths that had been passed down for centuries before Christianity was dreamt up. From dozens of precursor messiahs raising the dead, coming back from the dead after several days, being called the Way and the Light and the Son of Man, to being born of a virgin, to being crucified, and to many other uncanny similarities, the movie paints a convincing and compelling picture of Jesus as nothing more than a myth built with a collection of the attributes of the precursor messiahs that were adapted for a different culture, and, upon being written down decades to centuries after Jesus was alleged to have lived, adapted further to fit into a somewhat coherent narrative that also served to retrofit Jesus into many of the Old Testament prophecies in order to paint a picture of him as the savior of man. Considering that there were no contemporary writings about Jesus by any confirmed sources when Jesus was said to have done things that no other human in history could do and was allegedly known all the way up to the Jewish and Roman leaders, Jesus was never  known to have written a single word himself (which isn't surprising with the illiteracy rates during the that time), there were no such concepts as forgery and analytical thinking, copying and changing oral traditions was commonplace, and the earliest books of the New Testament weren't written until decades after Jesus died by people that had never met Jesus, it is hard to imagine that, with all of those facts stacked against the belief in Jesus as he is described in the Bible, anyone concerned with the truth would be able to maintain that kind of belief without having severe cognitive dissonance or being misguided by their indoctrinated biases and/or culture of belief without doubt even in the face of indisputable evidence for the contrary.",1425081600,,2330,4.883838383838384
2454638,1,B000CAPZBC,"This documentary seems to be much more about the film maker's own personal anguish about his experiences as a born again (several times apparently) Christian than it is about the historical Jesus.  As a result, it's not very compelling or interesting.  I have, over the years done a fair amount of reading in comparative religious studies, including formal courses lectures, etc.  If you are genuinely curious, a great starting place is a book called Misquoting Jesus, available on Amazon.

There are lots of compelling arguments about the mishandling of timelines in the New Testament, inconsistencies, things that were changed in scripture long after numerous copies of the synoptic gospels were widely circulating, church suppression of some non-canonical writings and so on.  While Brian Flemming outlines some basic timeline and plausibility issues surrounding the New Testament he offers what I can only describe as a one-sided hit job on the Good Book that appears to be out of the Michael Moore school of character assassination film making.  Flemming's film is intellectually dishonest and therefore lacks the moral authority to suggest that anyone abandon their faith.

The essence of this film is that of the typical straw man argument.  To surmise, ""These basic facts that believers of the biblical literalism school of thought ascribe to are demonstrably false. Therefore, Jesus was made up completely and our lives are being ruined by these churches and oblivious, happy fools that follow them and worship the fake God.""

Never mind the fact that many types of Christian faith are followed throughout the world.  Surprise, there are at least 9 major branches of Christianity and many denominations under these.  There are also many people who consider themselves Christians who do not worship at a traditional Christian church, for instance, at Unitarian Universalist churches.  Perhaps Mr Flemming spent too much time with Fundamentalist Christians who would disagree with some of those forms of belief and worship, but it's hardly up to them who is a True Christian.

Mentioning Mr. Flemming, who has put Christianity under the bright, lights for inspection, I am also disappointed that he won't illuminate his own life a bit more.  After all, he volunteered himself as an example of someone who the Christian faith has failed, even putting himself on camera to renounce the Holy Spirit, yet he offers nothing about his person struggles for us to gauge his experience by.  What type of failings, doubts, sins drove him to three separate born again experiences to clean off his slate?  We're told nothing except how the faith failed him.  Perhaps he failed himself or others more than religion has failed him.  It's impossible for me to say.  Just as it's impossible for this film to dismiss everyone's faith out of hand.",1424736000,,2836,5.152838427947598
2454639,5,B000CAPZBC,I thought this movie cast a bright light on the myth that is Christianity. I have watched it several times and recommend it to all of my friends.,1423872000,,145,4.214285714285714
2454640,1,B000CAPZBC,"This movie opens with a blatant manipulation...implying people who believe in the bible are at fault for  the actions of crazy people and for believing incorrect things about the universe.  The Bible makes NO stance on what revolves around what.  It DOES comment in Isaiah that the earth is round.  A few minutes later the narrator makes inaccurate statements as to when the Gospels were written.  (perhaps he just didn't know? Or was guessing?  As he cites no sources for his falise information.)
I have to wonder...why is it so important for non-believers that those who do believe believe?  (Why is so important for them to want me to go to hell if there is one?)  Ridiculous.  For believers who study history and discoveries this movie is a really good examply of how some will just lie and twist because they think Christians are stupid and uneducated.  It is clear that it is felt the average Christian is so gullible that they will believe any area of doubt.  The Bible is blatantly misquoted.  Many ""points"" are so obviously false I had to stop watching to go look up the date this came out, as a lot of the information in it has since be proven wrong.  (so one point for being intermittently sincere).  It is very much OK to question your faith.  Just don't question it and  base your disbelief on someone's opinion or alleged ""facts"".

2454642,5,B000CAPZBC,"As a schoolboy I was also indoctrinated into the Catholic belief system. Still, in those quiet moments alone I sometimes wondered why the biblical character called ""God"" could be supremely powerful and totally aware of human suffering but repeatedy chose not to end it. Instead he created conditions that would insure that the suffering would continue.
  Brian's highly entertaining video helped me realize that the Old Testament, which is where we are introduced to God, is the collective thinking of Hebrew tribes that tried their best to understand and gain control over their world. Unfortunately they posssessed only a fraction of the knowledge and tools for the task that we have today.
  Having read the New Testament many times it simply reinforced my belief that neither God the Father nor His human incarnation, Jesus, know how to help us with all of our problems.
 Brian's critics have righteously pointed out,  that Brian Fleming is not a biblical scholar and is broadcasting inaccurate facts with his video but if you browse the landscape of bible scholars who disagree over ""the facts"", at least his version offers sorely needed comedy, which is sadly missing throughout the Bible. It's also true that Brian tried to trick his nemesis, the school superintendant Ron Sipis, into admitting what Brian perceived as a misrepresentation of the truth. Perhaps an honest man who sincerely believed in truth would have stayed and debated Brian on camera instead of walking out. I believe that Brian tried to show Ron the inner conflict (cognitive dissonance) he experienced under the school's policy - a policy to accept its religious teachings as truth when it was actually based on faith.",1418256000,,1696,5.08273381294964

It is of my viewpoint that if you believe something then you shouldn't be afraid of questions.

I often feel a pull to read books by authors whose viewpoints I don't agree with. Am I a Bible scholar who knows everything? Absolutely not but I am someone who seeks truth.

This film came across as being completely ignorant of moderate Christianity. When portraying the secular view of Christianity they utilize experts in the field. However when portraying Christians they choose people off the street or radical Christian fundamentalist. This choice directs the story to portray aetheist as smart academic people and Christians as kind of dumb or uninformed. You tell the story you want to tell and the film makers clearly don't know anyone who is both a believer in Christ and informed. I would love to see this documentary made again. I think there is valuable information for both the believer and the unbeliever but I think it needs to come from a place of intelligence.

Like most good documentaries, though, it oversimplifies at times and gets a few things wrong. For instance, the tradition of Jesus being born on December 25th is probably irrelevant to what the early Christians believed, since we have no evidence that December 25th was considered the birthday of Christ by anyone in the first or second centuries AD.

I went into this documentary (though I had my doubts of its worth) hoping for some honest discourse on the subject, maybe, for once, a film that would lay out strong philosophical claims for the non-existence of God and could generate some real discourse on the subject.

Unfortunately, the film seems to be made by a man who has swapped one fundamentalism for another.  Brian Flemming was a born-again Christian as a child and, in his adult years, became a materialist.  And, as the film unfolds, it becomes apparent that he simply has an axe-to-grind against the school he went to as a child.

He interviews his old superintendent about the curriculum he was taught, but begins grilling him on questions of science.  It gets to the point where the superintendent asks him to turn off the camera.  When he refuses, it becomes apparent that this interview has been misrepresented and, much to his credit, the superintendent walks off.

It seeks no philosophical answers, gives no credit to its opponent, seeks out easy targets to make them look foolish and is rather nasty in tone.

On top of that, one of his chief arguments is that the gospels were written several decades after Christ and we do not know what happened in the intervening years.

Christians engaged in this type of debate hear points like this time and again.  It would have been good of Flemming to seek out a theologian, biblical scholar, somebody who is well-educated and well-versed on the subject and could provide some counterpoints.

But nay, instead of this, he very dubiously approaches average Christians (a young mother with a child, etc.) and, I'm sure under false pretenses, interviews them about the Christian past.  Whoa, look out, people at a baseball park don't know too much biblical history.

Flemming then uses Charles Manson, Pat Robertson, a murdering mother and others as examples of Christianity gone wild.  Also, he keeps a count of how many scenes in ""The Passion"" have blood.  This is, apparently, some check upon religion and Christians' respective obsession with gore.  He, of course, ignores the fact that Roman torture did contain mammoths amount of blood, also that Mel Gibson, uh, had some issues, especially around this time of his career.

There are some decent interviews with historians specializing in mythology, but they never provide the slam dunk Flemming hopes for.  Again, any theologian or Christian who has a passing interest in academia knows there were plenty of messiah figures before, during & after the time of Christ.  Mr. Flemming seems to count this as far more than it's worth.

To quote Vonnegut (and later David Bentley Hart in his excellent essay ""Believe It Or Not"" that Flemming would have done well to read), ""so it goes.""

2454660,1,B000CAPZBC,"This film was a jumbled, unpleasant and antagonistic mess.

From the very beginning Brian Flemming sets outs to misinform and directly attack Christians by showing interviews from Christians who were clearly delivering of the worst interviews. Brian then begins the film by offering a six minute overview of Jesus' life that is tedious to say the least.

Following this he begins to offer a look into the 30-60 years that fell between Jesus' life and the writings of the Gospels. This is where things really seem to fall apart for Brian. Brian then points to the character of Paul who was working between the death of Jesus and the writing of the Gospels, he states that Paul was uninformed of Jesus' life and ministry and that he didn't see Jesus as an earthly player but rather as a heavenly one. Here Brian mentions that Paul never heard about many events in Jesus' life though he fails to mention that Paul actually does mention the Last Supper. He then misquotes a verse from Hebrews to make it look as though Paul didn't actually think of Jesus as a man, there are two problems with this, one is that even Christians don't believe Paul wrote Hebrews, and the other is that the translation he uses is incorrect as well as misconstrued.

Another quote he misuses is when he takes a verse from Luke that presents itself as though Jesus is actively telling his disciples to bring his enemies before him so he may kill them, the problem though is that this is taking place within a parable and isn't actually expressing Jesus' actions.

The final nail in this movie's coffin comes in the ending, though the movie builds up the presentation of Christians and does its best to present them as blood-thirsty and ignorant, the moment of truth comes in an interview between Brian and his former principal. Brian immediately turns the interview into an attack and the principal eventually tells Brian he's not continuing the interview, the implications are clear, Brian is implying that the principal is pig-headed and ignorant, although the principal was doing what anyone would do in that situation, walk away.

In the end we get a glimpse into the real reason Brian made this documentary, he wants someone to feel bad for him. He wants someone from his school to apologize to him and tell him everything is going to be ok, this movie is ultimately just a self-centered rant of a film that does more damage than good. It ends with him denying the Holy Spirit which is the ultimate proof of his self-centered attitude.

I don't hate films like this, I am a Christian and I watch films like this to get a glimpse of Christianity from another perspective. This movie though is just an ignorant, inflammatory, misinformed mess.

I got curious with the title so watched it but got disappointed. If you think I am getting butt hurt, then think again. I am reading Christian/Judaism parody that are more brutal than this film. And I find those Christian/Judaism parody or you can call it satire interesting than this.

First, interviews from ""authorities"" are biased and one-sided. How can someone interview those who are authors, professors, etc and compare their responses to the people that was interviewed who are for Christianity? If this is really a ""well-researched"" documentary, then both sides would have presented its arguments and answers from people who have the knowledge on history and theology.

Second, there are many errors in the ""facts"" presented and also nit picking on quotes to satisfy the narrator's point of view on Christianity.

FYI: There are multiple king Herod and not only one. That made me laugh all the way as this film or ""documentary"" is only a rant from a butt hurt individual.",1397001600,,1077,4.966666666666667

The director's ""facts"" are misquotations and misunderstandings of the historical facts.  He portrays his facts with an extremely biased view.  He does atheists, agnostics and Christians no favors and creates a film for shock value with no insight.  We can all agree that there are many unanswered questions about the the Christian faith and Jesus but this film offers no perspective or information to inspire curiosity and conversation.  This film is little more than a rant.",1395878400,,568,5.053763440860215

There were early Gnostic Christian sects with works containing Jesus that were not included in The Bible. I saw little factual knowledge compared to the author's personal outrage he had with the church. What he did to the principal of that school was childish and he did himself no favors for keeping that in since the head of the school acted much more mature, I felt bad for the guy. Why not blame his parents for sending him to that institution? The author is so visibly angry it trumps any facts he has to offer (which are arguable).

2454665,1,B000CAPZBC,"The existence of Jesus of Nazareth as a living, breathing person within a historical context, is almost universally accepted by modern historians. Given that the audacious premise of this film is that Jesus never existed, one would expect some groundbreaking new information based in sound research and sustained by a strong logical framework to make that case.

Instead, this film is full of factual errors, suffers from an unfocused exposition, and is so clearly biased, that it is hard to take it seriously. It boggles the mind that, at the time of this review, the film has a 3 star rating.

I remember pondering on the mention that the author of the film, Mr. Flemming, was a ""former Christian fundamentalist"" if I remember correctly. This information made sense in the context of the film, because it casts many doubts on the potential ability to reason of a self-proclaimed ""former Christian fundamentalist"".

It is also often the case that individuals given to extreme views will often swing dramatically from an end of the spectrum to the other like a crazed wind dial in the middle of a hurricane. In this case, after watching this film, it is evident the author has gone from blind belief to blind disbelief, and remained stupid during the whole process.

Could this film actually be a surreptitious attempt to convert people to Christianity? It is THAT bad.",1385596800,2,1369,4.913419913419913

After investing an hour or so in reading Amazon reviews, it's hard to add anything new to the five star reviews. Ever since reading works of Tom Paine in high school, my interest in the many gods and religions has only increased.

FULL DISCLOSURE:
As a wayward Unitarian (born only once) I've have no first-hand experience with any of the gods. So much yet to be learned.

I must confess, while visiting a friend on Cyprus, we saw where  Aphrodite (Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, procreation) is reported to have hung out. Her Roman equivalent is Venus. As goddesses go, not bad. On another trip, I'd hoped to see Mount Olympus (home of many other important gods). ALAS. My getting mugged in Athens cut this trip short. It would be nice to return to Greece - this time in an organized group with an armed guard.

2454667,5,B000CAPZBC,"A colleague of mine loaned this DVD to me and I gave it a viewing. The narrator in a calm and nonchalant manner questions and brings up the fallacies of belief. He interviews several people including Alan Dundes who is an anthropology professor at the  University of California, Berkeley, neurology scientist Sam Harris and history professor Richard Carrier. Another individual is a superintendent of a Christian school in California which ends abruptly when the interviewee becomes entangled in his own answers and the narrator Brian Flemming points out the inconsistencies and fallacies in his answers. The superintendent does not wish to speak any further when he is backed into a corner of not being able to substantiate and backup his claims and reasons for teaching young children that the Christian view of the world is correct and reality.

Christians won't like the video because it illustrates in the film the number of religious followings that had their own ""heros"" with an uncanny similar story to the biblical story of Jesus. One of the many problems for Christianity is that most of these stories which are very similar (virgin births, resurrections etc...) pre-date the birth of Jesus. So it calls into question the whole Jesus story as being nothing but a story and a myth. Flemming also touches on the psychology of how stories that are untrue and nothing but pure fiction gain traction and then switch to being factual and non-fiction in the human mind. Interesting.

The film ended quickly and there was much more that could have been explored, but maybe Flemming was running out of time and money. It is a good piece of filmmaking (although not on the level of a NOVA or National Geographic program). Although not as polished as the previous mentioned programs, it still should bring up questions for Christians and definitely some red flags. However, hardcore fundamentalists or even just moderate Christians who want to hold onto their belief in Jesus will either just dismiss the film or as some have declared that it is the work of the devil man himself.",1381622400,7,2079,4.951289398280802
2454668,5,B000CAPZBC,"I really wanted to give 4.5 stars because the production quality was a little low-budge.

My boyfriend & I were looking for something quick & not too exciting to watch together as we both had an early next morning but wanted to watch a film anyway. This one is an hour long, so it was the perfect length. I am atheist & he is not sure about whether there is a Creator or not, but he is definitely not Christian. Though I am aware of what I see as full-blown delusion in Christians, I was still very surprised to hear some of the things that were said by some interviewed Christians in the beginning of the film & even more surprised to hear a Christian Evangelist state that homosexuality is comparable to murder & should be punished by death a bit later in the film. I think the filmmaker did a good job with 1 hour the time frame. It was an excellent introduction into the timeline of Jesus' life vs. when the new Testament was written & the debunking of some of the relationships Jesus allegedly had with certain Bible authors. I was already aware of some theories, such as Jesus simply being a fictional character like Zeus or Osiris, but this went into a bit of important detail I was unaware of. I really enjoyed the commentary of the experts he interviewed. If you are Christian & holding onto your faith & belief, you might be bothered by the commentary that I found enjoyable. if you are Christian & questioning your religion however, this film will probably open a few doors for you in your search. For a person wanting to know more, I think this film could use a supplemental piece that gets into more things that just don't make sense about the stories in the Bible & the alleged history of Jesus' family & life.

I agree with the reviewer that said that this is likely going to be a lot of preaching to the choir & not so much opening Christians to the possibility that religion in general is a fraud, but rather than be a fault of the film, I think that is just the nature of indoctrinated minds & what happens to people who have been sucked into cults. It will probably just make a lot of attached Christians angry, kind of like the Principal of the Christian School in the film. Atheists & people who are not fans of Christianity will generally like it.

I thought it was pretty funny too. Overall entertaining & informative.",1380758400,,2341,4.401847575057737
2454669,1,B000CAPZBC,"There are so many errors in this film it's tough to know where to start. But let me start this way, I am an atheist, I don't believe in god(s) and I have no problem debating theists. However, I also have no problem debating atheists that use logical errors, lie (or are highly misinformed), twist history and generally mislead other people; all to try to prove that atheisms is correct. Personally I like to take the high road and as an atheist I try to be as factually correct as possible.

Anyhow my low rating for this film is because it's rife with false historical claims and logical errors. If this is your sole source of information of 'Christianity' you will be horribly misled. And if you choose to use this films talking points in a debate you will look uniformed and down-right ignorant of history and Christianity in particular.

Here are some of my notes that I took while watching the film:

The film is wrong, the bible doesn't say the sun revolves around the earth, this is especially sad since this is the opening claim of the film and it gets it stunningly wrong, this is really not off to a good start.

The film dogmatically claims that Mark was the first gospel written - Small problem with that assertion, there is no empirical proof of this claim. There are historians that 'think' Mark may have been first but there also historian that 'think' Matthew or Luke was written first. Luke being written first is a minority position but Matthew has some very good arguments for it and is actually becoming the majority position among secular historians. The reasons are many but one of the most compelling is that linguists have strong evidence that suggests Matthew was originally written in Aramaic. Since almost all scholars and linguists seem to agree that the Mark and Luke were written in Koine Greek with the exception of Jesus' sayings which seem to be translated from Aramaic. There is almost unanimous agreement that the author of Mark did not speak Aramaic and only wrote in Koine Greek so he had to have gotten Jesus' saying from some Aramaic source. The Markian priority group know this so in order to keep their theory they have invented a ""Q"" gospel which is supposed to be the original saying of Jesus written in Aramaic. However we still have one problem, there is no mention of this book in any historical source, there is no mention of it by the church fathers, there is no mention of it in the ancient church catalogs, there are no papyri fragments of this book. In fact it was never mentioned, alluded to or even hypothetically thought of until something conjured it up in the 20th Century. The bottom line is the film wants us to accept that Mark is first through some magical knowledge they have, but the fact is there is no evidence to support this theory and quite a lot to promote others that seem more plausible.

MAJOR LIE: Mark does not say the temple was destroyed as the author blatantly claims, in fact all three of the synoptic gospels are written with the temple still standing. One of Jesus' most audacious claims was that the temple, the most revered Jewish holy site, was going to be destroyed. When he spoke of this the Jewish Pharisee's tried to stone and kill Jesus. Throughout the gospels the writers continually point to the fulfilling of prophecy as proof that Jesus was who he said he was. Many even argue, not without merit, that the gospel writers were so zealous of showing that prophecy had been fulfilled that they misinterpreted old testament prophecies and wrongly attached them to Jesus. With all of their zealotry to attach prophesy to Jesus one has to wonder why did none of the gospel writers mention the ""greatest"" prophecy that Jesus uttered had come true?????

Logic dictates that they would have shouted this out in their books, or in the epistles but they are all ominously silent - WHY? The logical conclusion that secular historians come to is that when Mathew, Mark and Luke were penned the temple was still standing. Couple this with the fact that the film aggress that Luke was the third gospel written (as do most secular historians) and you run into even greater problems with trying to late date it. Almost all historians agree that Luke and Acts were written by the same author, and many accept the fact that they were the trial documents that had to be submitted for Paul's defense in Rome. That is why Acts mysteriously ends with Paul in Rome awaiting trail, they seem to be a documentary of Jesus and then Paul's missionary life. If that is the case then Luke was finished by 63AD which is the exact time frame that it ends (with the temple still standing). Since the movie agrees that Mark and Matthew were written pre-Luke it makes it a very hard sell to claim that they were written before 63AD yet after 70AD.

MAJOR LIE: Claims that the epistles don't speak of Jesus or if they do it's all in a mythical realm. This is so blatantly false that I don't even know if I have to go into debunking it. Anyone can perform a cursory reading of the epistles to check the veracity of this claim and probably less than 30 minutes into they too would deem that this claim is laughably false.

For example, there are 357 versus that explicitly talk about Jesus in the Epistles, here is just a smidgen of the highlights about Jesus you would glean from reading only the epistles:

He was born of women,
Baptized,
Preached the gospel to men,
Ate food,
Had disciples,
Taught in the temple,
Healed the sick,
Was crucified by the Romans,
Suffered a painful death
Hung on a tree/cross, was entombed
Rose from the dead
Ascended to heaven.

It appears to me that the epistles say quite a bit about Jesus and all of it was based on earth not in some mythical realm that the filmmaker has made up. In fact when the filmmaker claims that Paul never thought Jesus was real person on earth you really have to wonder how stupid he thinks his audience is. The fact is one of Paul's main arguments throughout his epistles was his continually urging of his readers to speak to the eyewitnesses of Jesus' earthly ministry. If Jesus had been purely mythical idea in Paul's mind why did Paul and the rest of the NT writers continually beseech people to speak to the eye-witnesses to back up their accounts??????? Remember even the Jewish Pharisees of that time admitted that Jesus lived but they denied that he was the son of God. You would think that if this claim had ANY merit the contemporaries of a mythical Jesus would have pointed out that he never lived!

The next thing he tries to sell the readers is a strange rewriting of history. His claim is that Jesus lived (wait i thought he was mythical!?!?!?), then Jesus died and everyone forgot about him for a 40-60 years. But this ignores many historical manuscripts that talk about the Christian sect growing and becoming troublesome for the Jews BEFORE the temple was destroyed (70AD). We have records of Christians being martyred throughout the time period of 40-70AD. We know that they could be saved from death if they simply denied Jesus as God but they didn't and instead were killed for their belief. Even though there was rank persecution going on we have records that this religion was growing and expanding. So again the filmmaker lies/distorts history by ignoring it.

His complaint about The Passion of the Christ was just silly, the movie was about the crucifixion of Christ and what Christ endured leading up to and then during the crucifixion. The filmmaker complains that they show the crucifixion of Christ and what he endured and this somehow makes Christian bloodthirsty. HUH, that's like watching a war documentary about Hitler and then getting charged with being pro-Hitler and Pro-War.

MAJOR ERROR: As most historians admit, the inquisition was a political movement much more than a religious one but the filmmaker again lies to the public and claims the exact opposite even claiming that it is the embodiment of Christianity. I guess Mother Theresa didn't get that memo.

MAJOR ERROR: The most venerated people of the bible are the Jews, Christians are some of the most outspoken proponents of protecting Israel and the Jews yet according to the filmmaker none of that is true. In fact the bible is about hating Jews and Christians despise them too. I guess all those fundamentalist churches that support Israel didn't get that memo either.

MAJOR ERROR: Sam Harris makes a leap of logic so huge that you probably need an airplane to bridge the gap. There are believers who think that Jesus is coming back in their lifetime, however they also believe that they are commanded by god to be ""good stewards"" of the earth, to protect it and take care of it. Sam accepts the first but denies the later and says Christians actually will do the opposite never giving a reason why they believe A and supposedly not B even though they are both in the book they say is 100% correct.

Sam Harris also makes another illogical claim - this time he says that it's terribly scary and troubling that these Christians might elect leaders that are in Christians. Newsflash to Sam Harris, that's been happening since the founding of the country. In fact our country and our elected leaders were much more religious and much more biblical literalist than we are today. In fact early in the history of this country 60%+ of congressmen were practicing clergy members. On Sunday many of them would be leading churches so Sam Harris is so historically incorrect its laughable. The sad part is I usually like Sam Harris and have recommended his books on many occasions but these two flubs are an embarrassment and I may have to rethink if I will ever recommend him again.

The filmmaker claims he was a fundamentalist Christian but what becomes very apparent is that he doesn't have a clue about Christianity or much of its history. For example he claims that if you deny the holy spirit you will not be forgiven, yet that's not what the bible says. The passage that he is referring to is a hotly debated one among Christians (something he would know if he was ever a Christian) and even they don't agree what it means but after checking 15 different sources I couldn't find one that says it's the simple denial as the author claims. But it gets even more wacky, he claims he was ""scared to death"" that he had at one time doubted the holy spirit (he kind of changed it from denying to doubting) and he would pray feverishly about this issue. The sad part is he was either highly misinformed or had a very active imagination and is prone to being scared about things but projecting his irrationality on others doesn't help his case. BTW, after his interview with the president of the school where he claims he got this information it appears that the later is the case.

MAJOR ERROR: The filmmaker asks what naturalistic proof do you have proof for a supernatural being. HUH????? Talk about a major class confusion, I guess such sophistry might fool a third grader but anyone with a basic logic class sees through this arrantly stupid question.

That's all of my notes, sorry folks but this film is just too ridden with errors to make it worthwhile.

2454670,1,B000CAPZBC,"If there is one good reason to view this DVD then that is to see the mindset of a young man burned by a fundamentalist protestant upbringing embrace atheism and try to get you fired up about it too.

If there is another reason to watch it, it would be to see a rundown of bad arguments used by atheists against Christianity. The main argument of this movie is that Jesus ""never existed."" Of course in putting that out there, he is setting himself outside the mainstream even of atheists, and setting himself squarely up against historical and biblical scholarship the world-over. Not all of his viewers may be aware of this fact however, so caution is warranted. This is getting into conspiracy theory territory.

Apparently his intended audience was primarily meant to be young atheists who were struggling with just why they were giving up their Christian faith or agnostics sitting on the fence about the whole ""God"" idea. At one point Mr. Flemming, who produced and directed this ""documentary"" (propaganda film) was giving about ""666 copies"" of the movie through his fans, as part of a ""War on Easter"" campaign. Fans were supposed to get copies and put them in churches or other places where Easter-going Christians would see them. This is the atheist equivalent of fundamentalist Christians leaving Chick tracts at bus stops, laundromats, bathroom stalls, etc. though putting them in a neighbor's house of worship seems a little more intrusive to me.

In his movie, Flemming starts by comparing Christians being wrong about Geocentrism to them being wrong about other stuff, like the existence of Jesus. At least that's what its made clear the movie is eventually about. This of course is a mistake, because he's comparing the scientific consensus at the time of Galileo to the foundational historical basis for Christianity.

Flemming goes on to complain about how bloody ""the Passion of the Christ"" was (as if manipulating viewers or using blood to sell tickets isn't something that all sorts of filmmakers and documentary makers do, regardless of religion or lack thereof).

He mocks people ""on the street"" coming out of a Billy Graham style revival for not knowing the history of various ancient pagan gods (I doubt most people coming off of a college campus would know those names either, unless they were taking a course specifically on it).

He reiterates discredited theories like those of ""Acharya S"" (Dorothy Murdock) which also appear in ""Zeitgeist the Movie"" and ""Religulous"" (shame on you Bill Maher) that come from Kersey Grave's obsolete work ""The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors"" which purported to claim that all of the various religions (including the Abrahamic faiths) were derived from ancient sun-worship and that all the pagan gods were basically the same person, etc. This ""mythicist"" background is not solely the work of Graves however, as Gerald Massey (a ""self taught"" archeologist nearly a century ago wrote a bunch of stuff attempting to tie Christianity to ancient Egypt, at a time when Egyptology was in its infancy and has long since moved on). In addition, more recent writers like Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy wrote about them in ""the Jesus Mysteries"" (a book featuring an amulet of a crucified figure on the cover now recognized by most archeologists as a fake). Jordan Maxwell spun similar types of theories using false etymologies for words and made-up historical ""facts"" (apparently to try to get people to believe in space aliens). Retired pastor Tom Harpur even recently shocked his former academic colleagues by supporting the pagan copycat theory which casts the existence of Jesus into doubt. The related theory that Christianity was hopelessly corrupted by ""paganism"" and ""politics"" at some early stage is advocated even by some radical Christian writers, like the ""house church"" advocates Frank Viola and George Barna. So Flemming's demagoguery is merely giving a stage to some of the ideas that are out there (again, mostly from the internet and the speculation outside academic scholarship).

Flemming interviews people like Robert Price who say bizarre things about Jesus not existing, comparing him to comic book characters (historical figures whether their accounts are exaggerated or not are not the same as characters created as deliberate fiction intended for entertainment). Dr. Price, a legitimate New Testament scholar (though one on the fringe, last I heard he taught a distance learning course from some website, though he used to run an internet journal of ""Higher Criticism"" primarily for atheists and radical critics of religion) says that ""Some Christians"" believed that Jesus lived a century earlier (than is commonly believed) during the time of Alexander Janneus. The trouble is that this statement is completely dishonest. I know exactly what he is referring to, a polemical Jewish (not Christian) work called the 'Toledoth Yeshu' (look it up) which if anyone reads it, can see is clearly satire from a writer who is familiar with the New Testament and Christian doctrine. This is not a serious alternative account of the history of Jesus, and certainly not a representation of what early Christians actually believed (considering it was written many centuries after the NT).

Flemming misquotes ancient writers like Justin Martyr, much in the way that Zeitgeist does, with the idea that somehow this ancient Christian was forced to admit the pagan religions were all just like Jesus, and so his only excuse was to say that the devil traveled back in time and change everything so it would look that way. The message we're meant to take away is that even the ancient Christians ""knew"" their religion was just a plagiarism, and Jesus probably never existed. But as Justin's writings are available for free viewing online and can be read in context (they are pretty short, as ink and paper were expensive back then), we can see that Justin is arguing no such thing, and really he has been badly misrepresented. In fact, no ancient critic of Christianity argued that Jesus didn't exist, or that he was copied from pagan gods, and no Christian argues against such a position (leading one to believe the Jesus Myther position didn't exist in ancient times). In fact, the Myther position was first proposed in the 19th century by Bruno Bauer, and has failed to gain any credence since, except amongst conspiracy theorists in the radical atheist community (especially on the internet, where even the worst ideas achieve a degree of immortality).

In arguing that the date of the Gospels is too late to contain reliable history, again this is something anyone familiar with New Testament scholarship (and for the record, many NT scholars are not practicing Christians, as if one should assume all Christians must be liars!) knows that our knowledge of the historical existence of Jesus is not dependent upon the four gospels alone, but also the works of Paul (which are much earlier than the Gospels, and despite what silence Mythicist Earl Doherty says, do indeed depict Jesus as a real human being, a Jewish man who walked the earth in living memory of Paul, James his brother, John and Simon Peter his disciples), and the hypothetical ""Q"" Document. It is noteworthy that the ""Q"" theory is not favored by most evangelical Christians and those of the fundamentalist bent, but is accepted even by secular critical scholars. Again, these sources are very early, and even the Pauline letters cite earlier material. All again pointing to a real historical man that lived in the recent past, not a dreamy, other-worldly mythical being dreamt up in the minds of the writers (and why indeed dream up such a figure? if they were just making it up, why not make him a lot bigger and more successful like an Augustus or Alexander or Gilgamesh?). Next one could start arguing that James, John, Paul, and Peter never existed either (which some mythers are happy to do!). One might as well argue that Josephus, our primary ancient non-Christian source for Jesus, also didn't exist. Mythers are also inclined to dismiss any reference to Jesus as an ""interpolation"" or corruption, but usually in a knee-jerk manner, without justification. We can't simply dismiss a piece of evidence as a forgery without justification for doing so, simply because it doesn't fit a pre-determined conclusion. That's not how historical scholarship works, but people like Flemming (and his intended audience) are either unaware or uncaring of such standards, it seems.

Flemming complains about fundamentalism, specifically the Religious Right (which of course are the target of complaints by many Christians as well, don't forget that). He quotes Luke 19:27 out of context to imply that Jesus wanted all non-believers killed, or that Christians think Jesus taught that. Reading the context (the entirety of Chapter 19 of Luke's Gospel) makes it clear he is quoting a character in a parable, not asking his followers to kill in his name. Anyone who can read, can see that's not the case, so Flemming has little to fear from hoards of bloodthirsty Christians storming his home anytime soon. It's also worth mentioning that chapter and verse numbers were a medieval addition to the Biblical texts as an aide to scribes and lectors, so the ""context"" of a passage often extends beyond the chapter and verse where one finds a quotation.

Flemming interviews Richard Carrier, an atheist graduate student writer who talks about how a person doesn't need to be religious to be moral (Carrier at this time was studying to be a historian, he has since earned his doctorate and is in the process of writing a book on how he thinks Jesus probably didn't exist, though he takes the ""silence"" approach instead of the pagan copycat theory). Carrier, to his credit, knows that Kersey Graves' work is worthless (and to Flemming's credit, he later admitted it was a mistake to use any of Graves' work in the movie).

That's another thing, Flemming here seems to be exploring the many possible ""alternatives"" and trying to gather reasons to reject Christianity.

He argues that pastors are mean, preachers say politically incorrect things, that Passion movies are violent, that people at revivals are ignorant. He says maybe Jesus was a pagan copycat savior. Or maybe there isn't enough evidence to prove Jesus was really a historical figure (silence mythers say this, people like Earl Doherty).

The fact is though that this is bad scholarship. Even agnostic writers like Bart Ehrman have written debunkings of the ""silence myther"" and ""pagan copycat"" theories of Jesus Mythicism. Of course they are getting incredible flack from people like Acharya S and Richard Carrier who seek to profit from the publicity amongst internet atheists and atheist students that these types of theories generate. Can't sell books and make speaking appearances if real scholars are discrediting your work now can you? But I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

The ideas Flemming presents in the movie are either irrelevant (the truth of Jesus' claims are not invalidated by modern people who claim to follow him but fail at it; a religion isn't judged solely by one filmmaker's artistic representation of it which is based on tastes anyway, etc) or contradictory (Jesus could not be both a known pagan copycat and simply not exist for lack of historical evidence while being portrayed from ancient times as a historical person who actually lived on earth). The ""experts"" he quotes don't agree with him, and don't agree with each other. All he seems to be looking for are a bunch of different reasons to ""doubt.""

Moving on, Flemming tries to get the people behind ""Snopes.com"" to admit that Christianity started as an urban legend, but kinda fails.

He interviews Alan Dundes (the often controversial expert on folklore at USC Berkley) to get him to say that Jesus fits a ""heroic template"" kind of deal (using Lord Ragland's list) and therefore is probably a figure of folklore rather than history. One can argue with this method as being so overly broad and cherry-picking as to be useless. Sadly Prof. Dundes died shortly afterward.

Flemming ends the movie by holding an interview with his former Christian school principal and then ambushing partway through about how he shouldn't have taught people that his faith was true and scaring people without proof. It ended badly and Flemming put the interview in the movie even though the principal asked him not to. He proceeds to the old chapel where he says he prayed to Jesus and basically ""got saved"" so many times and dramatically looks into the camera and says ""I deny the Holy Spirit.""

The explanation is that Mr. Flemming thought, growing up, that there was an ""unforgivable sin"" and if you doubted the existence of the Holy Spirit, you could not be forgiven and would be eternally damned to hell. Here he is asserted his ""faith"" that Christianity is false, God doesn't exist, and calling all atheists to 'come out of the closet.' This lead to the youtube ""Blasphemy Challenge.""

Of course anyone schooled in actual Biblical theology (rather than fearful memories of a fundamentalist school principal) whether Catholic or Protestant will know that in context, the ""blasphemy of the Holy Spirit"" has nothing to do with doubting the existence of God. In context, it refers to Matthew chapter 12 (which anyone can read for free online in a variety of translations or in the original Greek for that matter), where some Jewish opponents of Jesus witness him casting out demons, then declare ""He casts out demons by Beelzebul."" I encourage you to read it for yourself, but it refers to those who witness the miracles of God and attribute them to the power of the devil. The only other sense that theologians (Catholic, for instance) regard the ""unforgivable sin"" is in terms of a person's stubborn rejection of the Holy Spirit's ability to forgive our sin. As long as one remains in that mental state, they cannot be forgiven, because they are rejecting forgiveness itself. That is not truly unforgivable however, as the person may come out of that and accept God's forgiveness. In Christianity theology, one can have reassurance that if one fears one has committed the ""unforgivable sin"" they probably haven't.

So in sum total I would give this video zero stars just for sheer misinformation. Sadly, by waving the ""proud atheist"" banner, Flemming gets far more of a pass from viewers than he deserves. I give him far more credit than I do the director of ""Zeitgeist."" In a way, I come from this movie feeling sorry for Mr. Flemming more than angry at him for so distorting the truth.

The movie is very low-budget, with cheap looking sets and lighting and lots of stock footage (much like Peter Joseph's ""Zeitgeist""), the sort of thing you'd prefer to watch online than pay actual money to see on a physical media.

I imagine some people unfortunate enough to end up with those 666 copies are still trying to pawn them off. At one time this was viewable (even with the ""dvd extras"" which are extended interviews) on sites like youtube for free. For a much better defense of atheism, read Christopher Hitchens or Bertrand Russell. For a much better treatment of the historical Jesus, there are a myriad of writers to choose from (Luke Timothy Johnson, NT Wright, Bart Ehrman, Geza Vermes, Mark Allen Powell, E.P. Sanders, Robert Van Voorst). Even Marcus Borg would be more profitable time spent.

Many websites have gone exhaustively over Flemming's movie and corrected his errors on the Bible or the history of the Church. So if you want to seek ""the truth"" it is out there. But save your money this time.",1374883200,12,15648,4.984297204136346

The writer/director (or someone associated with the film) should really look up 'straw-man fallacy' and then understand how often that tactic shows up in the film.  One example:  comparing 'The Passion of the Christ' to other pop culture movies and saying that 'Mel Gibson could have made his movie any way he wanted...'  No.  'The Passion of the Christ' was about exactly what the title says -- the Passion of the Christ.  Only the last three days of Jesus's life.  That's not comparable to 'Jesus Christ Superstar' nor does it give Mel Gibson the artistic freedom he/they suppose.  Ditto the misfits that write Christian Militia websites, TV evangelists quoted with extreme views, claiming that Paul was ignorant of Jesus's life because his letters don't recount the same history as the gospels, etc.  The majority of the 'expose' relies on misrepresenting the facts as complete or representative of the whole, and then knocking those down.

The interviews with Richard Carrier, Robert Price and Sam Harris are interesting, but only as appetizers. The theory that Jesus was a completely invented and fictitious character is considered ""out there"" even by mainline *secular* scholars such as Bart Ehrman. The narrator, Brian Flemming, seems to accept it wholesale, even claiming that Paul considered Jesus to be a purely mythical character, rather than a recently deceased, actual person! Such a bold statement requires a lot of additional discussion, lest it sounds Biblically illiterate...

After declaring that Jesus wasn't there and hence is silent, Flemming attacks Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion of the Christ"", interviews a rapture-ready Christian blogger and finally reveals that he (Flemming) is a recovering fundamentalist. The documentary ends with a somewhat awkward interview with the principal of Flemming's old Bible school.

""The god who wasn't there"" is essentially a movie about one man's journey out of fundamentalism, and some of the things that made him quit. Nothing wrong per se, but not what I expected either. I will therefore irreverently award it three stars.",1364774400,2,1390,5.3090909090909095
2454678,5,B000CAPZBC,"One of the puzzling things about the gospels is why any reader would ever have taken them seriously, back when they were written. The reason is that, back when they were written, the ""good news"" was already pretty old news. Most of us have heard, of course, that, back then, tales of pagan gods who were born of a virgin in a stable, worked miracles, were crucified and resurrected three days later, etc. etc., were as much a commonplace of popular literature as vampire tales are for us today. What is interesting about this video is that it actually lists off the different pagan gods whose careers were the same as Jesus'... but there were a lot of them, and the video/special features is only six hours long, so you have to have a quick eye and a pause button.

The story of Jesus is that of an Israelite attempt to paganize Jewry by giving it an up to date god who could compete with all the others in that part of the world. Today, of course, Jesus reigns supreme over half the world as the owner of this narrative, while all the others have been relegated to history's dust bin... all because it was the Jesus story that a certain ambitious Roman Emperor chose as his ""victory standard"" to unify all the contentious disaffected Roman street people. As it happens, it isn't the real Jesus story, as Bible scholars have known for a long time now, but no matter.

2454681,1,B000CAPZBC,"Few films make me angry - but this one did!! First off, the title is a cheat - it's not primarily about God or Jesus, but about the filmmaker's issues with a very one-sided and pernicious version of Christian teaching. Second, the film is not an in-depth investigation of anything, simply an hour of polemic built around some faux-cool pop music, un-snazzy graphics, and one-sided claims. Flemming chooses the most inflammatory texts and quotes these out of context to indict the figure of Jesus, who - whether or not he actually existed - is surely one of the great moral beacons humankind has produced. Finally, while Flemming's interviews include at least one reputable critic of Christianity, Sam Harris, he also interviews several believers who, like many Christians, are clearly inexperienced in fielding questions about their faith. In doing so, he makes these believers look ignorant - as they indeed are - but he makes **himself** look petty and snide.

It's not that this film is against Christianity - I'm a refugee from a version of fundamentalist Christian teaching very similar to the one Flemming rails against. I have a deep contempt for those who teach children - anyone, for that matter - a ""turn or burn"" religion, that God loves you and just can't hardly keep Himself from sending you to eternal torment.  But I have to say, the person I really cheered for in this film was the president of Flemming's Christian alma mater, who walked out of the interview, accusing Flemming of setting up the interview under false pretenses.

If you want a real critique of Christianity, there are lots of writers - Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, others - who have done their homework, along with well-meaning scholars trying to determine what we can really know, if anything, of the man from Galilee, what he claimed and who he thought he was.

The subtitle of this film is ""A Film Beyond Belief"". He got that right! The sheer lopsidedness, the lack of any creditable research, the triumph of rant - and it **is** rant, even if it's spoken softly - over any kind of balanced treatment is what is ""beyond belief.""

The director went into further detail in order to talk about the gaps formed in the Bible.  Such as the 20-30 years that past from Jesus being a 12 year old, to Jesus becoming a 30 year old adult.  The movie also talked about the 40 year gap between the events in Jesus's life as mentioned in the Bible, and the date in which the first books of the Bible were written.  It seemed like everyone forgot about Jesus in that 40 year gap, and then everyone suddenly remembered him afterwards.  The director went on to describe how out of all the Jesus movies, many of the Christians preferred the bloody movies compared to the other versions of the life of Jesus.  All in all, I feel that this movie is not really nitpicking at the religion of Christianity, but rather questioning the existence of Jesus.

It became clear by the end of the film that Flemming is very bitter about having been forced to attend a private religious school, and that this is his way of dealing with it.  His agenda led him to make several choices that were detrimental to the film.

Assuming that Jesus did not exist, because of the lack of information covering the period between the assumed date of his death and the writing of the gospels, is unwarranted.  Paul does not tell the story of Jesus' life because his letters were addressed to other believers who would already be familiar with this information, so there would be no need to repeat it.  Later, as the story had to be disseminated to more people, the gospels were written.  Flemming makes the mistake of claiming that Mark was the first one, with the other three based on it.  Current scholarship posits a lost ""Q"" gospel that along with Mark, contributed to Matthew and Luke, while John is clearly from another source entirely.  Flemming makes a mistake similar to that made by the New Age community with regard to the gap in the record for Jesus' life from age 13 to 30, where they claim he went to India during this time and became a Buddhist.  Gaps in the record aren't necessarily meaningful - the existence of Julius Caesar is indisputable, and not called into question just because we may not have a complete record of his life.  A more fruitful inquiry would be to accept that Jesus lived, but to question whether he said and did what the gospels claim.

Buttonholing attendees at a Pat Robertson rally and asking questions about obscure antecedents to Christianity is unfair.  How many people who accept the Theory of Natural Selection could explain the difference between Punctuated Equilibrium and Phyletic Gradualism, or say who Lamarck was?

Flemming was clearly going for a Michael Moore moment in his interview with Sipus.  He missed a great opportunity here.  When someone Moore is interviewing asks to say something off-camera, Moore will tell his cameraman to turn it off, but will keep it running anyway.  Sipus probably would have fallen for this.  Or, if Flemming wasn't comfortable with this deception, he could have ignored the request until Sipus walked away.  Instead, I found myself sympathizing with the subject, as he got up to walk away from Flemming's incessant whining.

On the positive side, the sections with the various commentators were excellent.  I have always found Robert Price and Sam Harris to be brilliant and insightful, and the other ones were good also.  I especially liked the one at the end who said that if he found himself in heaven, knowing that others were condemned eternally to hell, would be hell for him also.",1342310400,3,3249,5.065789473684211
2454694,4,B000CAPZBC,"This is a documentary with a rather interesting point of view. Brian Flemming, who produced and narrated the film, was once a fundamentalist Christian. In fact, one of the most interesting segments is when he visits the Christian private school he attended as a child and interviews the director. The director states on film that he knows this will be seen by the public and he's OK with that. But when Flemming starts asking him uncomfortable questions, he asks him to turn off the recording and speak to him ""off the record."" When Flemming asks him why, he repeats his request to turn off the videotape, and then walks out of the camera range.

He starts the film with a variety of quick questions for people out in front of a religious organization, but I'm afraid I don't remember which one. I think it was for a conference of some sort. He asks them questions about their religious knowledge and beliefs, and it becomes apparent that they are not very well informed about their own religion, let alone any others.

Another interesting character is Scott Butcher, a born-again Christian who runs a web site [...] where you can have his computer prepare a letter to your friends and loved ones to be sent after the rapture to explain why you have disappeared. There's even a video version for $7.00. I don't know exactly how sincere he is, but apparently he's had thousands of responses. He says several people have prepared rapture letters for President Bush (this is 2005, remember), but that he, Butcher, is confident that the president will be raptured.

There are a group of clips from old life of Jesus movies which Flemming uses to give a basic outline of the story of the gospels. These were pretty amusing. But he also discusses and extensively displays the Passion of Christ by Mel Gibson, where I had to turn my head. It is incredibly gory! He did a minute-by-minute study of the film, and pointed out that after the first ten minutes or so almost every minute there is something bloody on the screen. He points out that this must be what Christians want, because it was extremely popular, made a lot more money than other religious films, and was promoted by a lot of churches and other Christian organizations.

Several biblical experts and philosophers are interviewed, including most famously Sam Harris. There's a professor of mythology from U.C. Berkeley, writers of several scholarly works about Christianity and biblical history, etc. It's an interesting collection, and they have some useful things to say.

One of the most telling graphic presentations in the film is a time line of the biblical era. As various elements are positioned on the time line, certain interesting gaps become clear. If we take as a given that the life of Jesus was from 0 to 33 a.d., and accept that scholars are right in figuring the book of Matthew was written somewhere around 70 to 80 a.d., then the only ""testimony"" of the early period of the church is from Paul, formerly Saul of Tarsus. Saul was not an apostle, and in fact never met Jesus in the flesh. So very little indeed is known about the early church. Even the gospels (from say 70 to 120 a.d.), say little about the early church.

I will not attempt to reproduce the arguments which the film examines, but I will say that the one hour and two minutes which make up the main feature is but the tip of the iceberg. There is actually considerably more material in the ""special features"" on this DVD. All of it fascinating, occasionally amusing, and sometimes infuriating. I highly recommend this DVD.",1336953600,2,3563,4.71107544141252
2454695,1,B000CAPZBC,"I was hoping to find compelling arguments within the theism/atheism debate. Instead, I found a guy with a grudge against his old school, so he attacks Christianity using sarcasm and frustratingly thin, unresearched arguments (maybe he did some research on Wikipedia when he was bored on a weekend). It's little more than an immature rant poorly disguised as an academic refutation of Christianity.  Most of what he says is inaccurate, but it would take too long to cover everything.

I'll just mention the two most blatantly wrong claims, which are related: 1) that Jesus was not an actual person, and 2) that Paul didn't believe he was either. 1) There are multiple Jewish and Roman attestations of Jesus causing a scene at the Temple and being crucified by Pontius Pilate. That happened, whether the resurrection did or not. 2) Besides Paul's multiple explicit acknowledgments of Jesus' humanity, the Biblical verse he uses to show Paul didn't believe in it is from Hebrews - a letter Paul didn't even write, which actually focuses on Jesus' humanity. So Flemming's either ignorant or lying (possibly both). This ""documentary"" is an embarrassment for seriously thoughtful atheists.",1335571200,,1183,5.15625

The testimony of the Apostle Paul adds further evidence to the trustworthiness of the gospel's picture of Jesus. Paul confirmed the gospels testimony of Jesus' creating the universe, His total obedience to the Jewish law without ever committing a sin. Paul also confirmed Jesus was betrayed, crucified, and had risen from the dead on the third day.
The producers of the documentary show their vitriolic hatred and vile towards a message of love and salvation. Why make such a documentary like that? If you don't believe in God (Jesus) then just let it be. Clearly they are full of hatred and frustration, to produce the amalgam of deception mixed in with a little truth. Clearly they are confused what eternal damnation it, and that it's not perpetual suffering.
The documentary doesn't mention Christianity as a movement, and instead produces what a Roman made religion (started by Constantine) : the farthest thing from the teachings of Christ, along with all the other cults that have sprung from said religion (no names here.)
Of interest is the last scene, where he clearly states he denies the Holy Spirit. Again, showing bitterness, hatred, and lack of respect to believers.
This documentary should be in the Moor's miserable and deceiving Hall of Fame documentaries like Sicko and the likes.
Save your money, and your time, and instead, focus on researching the New Testament and its writers; something that a scope of a trashy documentary like this one can not produce.
There is only one Spirit of Truth, whom most of the world does not know, or that hates it. When Pontius Pilate asked Jesus who he was, Jesus answered: ""I testify to the Truth...""

2454697,3,B000CAPZBC,"If you were expecting something along the lines of Zeitgeist: The greatest Story Ever Told h[...] (as I) might well be disappointed at the contents of this quite mediocre 'documentary.' That this adds another voice to the debate is surely positive - that we are still having the Judaeo-Christian god debate in 2012 is intellectually very sad indeed.

Whilst there is no way to challenge believers (should one even wish to do so), no way to argue against blind faith or call people to account for value systems that guide both their lives and some elements of society and government, there is the historical record and THE historical record is something we can, or should be able to discuss rationally and academically as fellow beings seated around a table not screaming at each other on pavements or anonymously  posting hate on websites. That this film then doesn't really go any way to academically and anthropologically deconstructing the historical Jesus fable/myth/folklore (which is what it is) is something of a great shame because that is really all that can be achieved in an argument which is ultimately about personal beliefs and lifestyle aspirations.

There is a body of scholarly evidence out there which can almost dismiss the existence of an historical Christ Jesus figure and it is really that which this platform should have been used to present as a cohesive hypothesis, a hypothesis which would then have been passed to the non-secular side of the table to refute a la. disjunctive syllogism, which by failing to be disproved would have proved the hypothesis accurate and authentic. The problem is, however, that this film does not present any more than another voice in the debate, certainly no smoking gun and certainly no attempt to proffer a water-tight hypothesis. That is ultimately a great shame.",1334620800,,1824,5.013201320132013
2454698,2,B000CAPZBC,"I watched this for free online.  If you're thinking of buying it, but haven't seen it yet, I strongly recommend doing that first.  The film is only 60 minutes long and if you stopped it after about 50 minutes, I would say ""C"", maybe ""C-"", but after the nose-dive that is the last ten minutes, I'd drop it at least a letter grade.  Both of the stars I'm giving it are for the guests he interviews, some of whom I rather admire and have read and/or heard before (Sam Harris and Robert Price in particular) with much appreciation for their work.  The problem here is the embarrassingly amateur tone of the work.  The movie culminates in the director (Flemming) returning to the christian school he attended as a child and trying to put its administrative head on the hook for everything he didn't like about going there.  It's almost painful to watch for two reasons: 1. The guy he interviews is a christian educator, so asking him to make sense of nonsensical beliefs in an impromptu grilling in front of a camera, deliberately attempting to discredit and humiliate him, doesn't feel like much of a victory for secularism and rational thought, it's just kind of sad.  Of course there's no logic to it, it's religion. Of all the people you could choose to represent the ""opposing view"", why that poor guy?  2. In his attempt to dismantle the argument for teaching kids about god and to strike a blow against the bitter childhood memories he's been harboring for decades all in one fell swoop, the director as interviewer seems so poorly prepared, unprofessional, and angry, that it becomes glaringly apparent that the whole film is about himself, personally, and not so much the historicity of jesus, which is the more interesting of the two.  When he's accused of being dishonest in setting up the interview, I tend to believe it.  When the interview is cut short, he loiters around campus and takes the last scene for himself as he trespasses in the chapel.  One other glaring item:  I found the crack about the people who lost their lives at Waco distasteful, insensitive, and sophomoric.  ""Crispy""?  Really?  Why was that even in there?

I guess this is the inevitable result of how simple and inexpensive it's becoming to put together a film like this.  Anyone sufficiently motivated by the chip on his or her shoulder can get up a few thousand dollars and give it a go.  I really would like to see the version of this film that has no attitude, no man-on-the-street interviews, and spends about twice the time getting much deeper into the really interesting origins, meanings, and evolution of christian myths and the traditions that have grown up around them from pre-christian days to modern times.",1334016000,2,2703,4.727078891257996
2454699,1,B000CAPZBC,"I'm not a Christian or Atheist, but I love hearing about the history of the Bible and interpretations of what could have ""really"" happened. Books like The Gods of Eden, Misquoting Jesus, Who Wrote the Bible? and Fingerprints of the Gods are literature that I usually recommend to anyone who's in the same boat as me. I never try to push my own personal beliefs on anyone unless they really, really want to know what I believe in (this rarely goes well when it happens), but I sure as heck don't go around trying to debunk what someone honestly believes in. Why should I? Everyone has a right to believe in something. That being said, The God Who Wasn't There disappointed me in several big ways, with one of the big ones being that it came off as a documentary made by a video site commenter who shoots down anyone who says they believe in Jesus. The only good things I can say about this documentary are small things that I found interesting, which include the number of non-violent minutes in The Passion of the Christ and a few semi-book recommendations.

The documentary starts out somewhat decent: it gives a little timeline of Jesus' early years, then points out a gap in time where he was seemingly missing, and asks several Christians questions about how Christianity expanded once Jesus was gone. Everyone has the same answer more or less, that it was spread by word of mouth and through the Holy Spirit. This answer isn't good enough for Brian Flemming, the narrator and director. Suddenly we go off track from talking about Jesus and that space of time where he was gone, which would've been interesting, to him trying to shoot down various passages, pointing out the flaws in Christian schools, and just throwing together a bunch of old news clips of absurd people talking about how we need to lead America in god's name or something like that (you know, the people that give Christians a bad name similarly to how people with the mindset of Flemming give Atheists a bad name). Fortunately, Brian chose to interview a couple of people who are educated in not just the Bible, but other topics like folklore as well. The most interesting part of this documentary is an interview with Alan Dundes, author of Holy Writ as Oral Lit: The Bible as Folklore. Alan points out a couple of things that make you think, including his 'Greek hero pattern' that you can do a quick search for and go from there. The documentary reaches a quaint climax, for lack of better term, where Flemming goes back to his old Christian school and asks one of the people in charge about how they can teach young children about god and the Bible when there's no definitive proof that any of it happened. Honestly, it seems like the guy isn't giving him the overreaction that he was hoping for, and Flemming keeps pushing question upon question upon him until the interview finally gets cut short.

At about an hour long, The God Who Wasn't There is a giant mess only worth watching under certain circumstances. If you're the kind of person that rubs your hands together and licks your lips when you merely hear someone talk about god, then rush in to shoot them down (be it in-person or, more likely, online), this is the kind of thing you will eat up no matter what. If you're a skeptic looking for an informative documentary, keep looking and save your time by passing this movie and going with a good book instead. Or, if you're planning on making a religious documentary, you definitely should see The God Who Wasn't There, to serve as an example of what not to do. Others have been kind enough to not dock the score for the production values and how it was produced, but I won't be so nice. Between generic laid back DJ music that sounds like it's a demo program on a keyboard, to the horrible way the movie is narrated with an ""uh"" breaking up nearly every sentence, and how there's no set topic, there's nothing that the movie does right, aside from showing some cool clips of old Jesus movies, which was probably the most expensive part of making this thing. I'll admit that I laughed when, for no reason, they pointed out the very low number of minutes in The Passion of the Christ where a bloody Jesus isn't shown, but after they were done and moved on, never going anywhere with that subject, it just irritated me even more. What, you simply wanted to point out that the best selling Jesus movie was the most violent one? That's it?

It was a chore to sit through the whole thing, with each little annoyance pushing me to hit the stop button every couple of minutes. Brian Flemming comes off as a wanna-be Michael 'the Hutt' Moore or Morgan Spurlock. This documentary proves nothing and feels self-congratulatory, even at the end when it's noted how serious denying the Holy Spirit is, and goes the extra mile of saying he doesn't believe in it, apparently just to show off how 'smart' he is. Unfortunately I can't recommend any good documentaries about Christianity to watch over this one aside from the obvious Deliver Us From Evil and Jesus Camp. If you haven't seen either one yet, check 'em out. With The God Who Isn't There, there's nothing really objective because it never goes anywhere long enough. Hey, I'd rather sit through The Passion of the Christ than watch even 10 minutes of this thing again. THAT'S really saying something.",1333929600,3,5334,4.600840336134453
2454700,1,B000CAPZBC,"As a freethinker and atheist, as well as a documentary filmmaker and film lecturer, I was very keen on getting to see this film. After watching it, I was highly disappointed because of its content, its approach and its style.

In terms of its content, this film really discredits serious atheists. Several ""facts"" are simply wrong and manipulated to serve the main argument. Educated people who see through these fallacies are bound to lose any trust and respect for the narrator/filmmaker. For instance, at the very beginning Flemming asserts that the Christians got the geocentric astronomical model wrong. Actually, this model originates in ancient Greece, so it is not a Christian invention (even if they persecuted heretics who proclaimed the heliocentric model).

The hyped and sensationalist way in which arguments and ""facts"" are presented is detrimental to any serious point the director is trying to make. I have no problem with the collage-like and playful tone and visual style of this documentary, which is inspired by ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Supersize Me"". However, unlike Moore and Spurlock, the way this style is used to represent the topic and themes is infantile. The animations and graphics in combination with his voice-over is highly patronising and seems to address either uneducated people or children. It is also highly exploitative to do vox-pops with devoted Christians and ask them intellectual questions about historical facts or apologetics and get ridiculous responses. This pseudo-Socratic approach is expected to create tension and cheap TV, NOT to make people think (whether the audience or the interviewee). In ""Religilous"" Bill Maher uses a much less Socratic approach in which he doesn't just question people's views, but also expresses his opinions. This is much more self-reflexive and honest, which makes Maher a much more respectable narrator and presenter, and we are more likely to trust him.

What is the focus of this documentary?

Is it to debunk Jesus's existence? Flemming doesn't offer any argument against the actual existence of Jesus. The arguments about the mythical character Jesus do not deny that someone of this name might have really existed (for which there are historical clues, even if not strong evidence). Most of the film, though, is not about Jesus's existence but about debunking Christian doctrines.

Is the focus to promote atheism (which I was hoping)? It is certainly not, because the few atheist arguments Flemming uses are ridiculous and not even used by serious atheist apologists. For instance, the institutional aspect of faith (such as Christianity) is not a valid argument against a super-natural being, simply because most atheists and good theologians agree that religions are human constructs. In TGWWT Sam Harris offers an excellent argument paralleling pathological conditions (such as delusion and psychopathy) with religious belief. However, instead of developing this argument further (like Bill Maher does in Religilous) Flemming cannot wait to go back to his infantile MO, playing a frustrated anti-Christian and neurotic crusader who wants to overcome a childhood trauma of religious indoctrination.

Flemming's declaration in an interview that he is a ""Christian Atheist"" shows that he doesn't really know what he is talking about, plus, he is more interested in media hype than a serious documentary (with ""serious"" I mean a documentary that connects to an audience and actually makes people think, not ""serious"" in tone. ""Religilous"" is a comedy but still a serious documentary). If he would look at the etymology of ""Christianity"" and ""Christ"", he would understand that it implies exactly what an atheist is not. So, instead of labelling himself with an oxymoron just for shock-value, he should rather do some reading and not pretend that ignorance is a virtue.

Would I recommend this film? Yes, for film students who want to learn of how not to make a documentary (in every aspect). No, to people who want to get some insight into atheism, apologetics or history.

PS: I deliberately did not attack the low production value of the film in relation to the film's content, but I do think it matters. If you watch a documentary where the interviews are shot horrendously and not colour-graded, and where 80% of the film is padded with graphics or copyright-free footage from archive.org (such as the long unnecessary sequence about Jesus's life, which even features a preposterous time counter to show the spectator how much time of this doco is being wasted), you WILL question the approach, experience and professionalism of the filmmaker and his documentary.",1333497600,6,4656,5.257065948855989

2454703,2,B000CAPZBC,"As an open-minded Christian, I enjoy reading the work of atheists. Richard Dawkins does a nice job of elucidating the atheist viewpoint. Even the recently-departed Christopher Hitchens, he of the vicious attacks on moral superheroes, makes a great case for the danger of religious thought.

But poor director Brian Fleming. His ""The God Who Wasn't There"" is all bluff and puffery, and not well-though-out at all.

This basic contention is that between 33AD, when Jesus died, and the writing of the first gospel around 70AD, very little happened. Jesus, in his lifetime was known, then was forgotten for thirty-five years, and then ""remembered"" again. This would indeed be compelling evidence if it were true. Fleming correctly states that Paul, who wrote in the 40s and 50s, did not write about the sayings of Jesus, his healings, the virgin birth or the other miracles. Fleming claim therefore that Paul did not know of these events at all. Which is a stretch - no consideration is given to the possibility that Paul knew of them but chose not to write about them.

But this argument is silly on a couple of fronts. Fleming omits the book of Acts, admittedly written around 85AD, that tells the story of the early church. In many cases, Acts at least parallels what Paul writes about, providing a source of some internal consistency. Fleming also ignores that Paul was not a historian, but an  apostle and preacher. All that mattered to Paul was that Christ, born of a woman, had been crucified, raised from death, and was soon  to return in glory. Who cared where he was born and what color his hair was?

Fleming resurrects the old argument that many gods in the ancient world were born of virgins, crucified, rose from the dead and are seated among the gods. This old dog sure has made the rounds. And it seems persuasive to those who don't study the ancient world. These claims are either hilariously wrong, or describe religions that came into being *after* Christianity and cribbed from its influence and powerful stories.

On the positive side, I appreciated the animated comparison of the Resurrection stories that Fleming included. If I taught religion, I would incorporate it into the curriculum. While fundamentalists might think it blasphemous to show discrepancies among the gospel accounts of Christ's rising, it's not so at all. Mainline scholars have known of the differences for years. Whether proclaiming the appearance at the tomb of a young man (Mark), two men (Luke), or one angel (Matthew), the gospel differences provide important insights into the minds of the evangelists and the development of the early church. The fact that the early church retained such radically different accounts - when harmonizing them would have made it look better - is a testament to its high regard for truth, no matter how uncomfortable. But Fleming's exegisis, while fun to watch, tells us nothing about the Resurrection and less about the gospel writers. He seems to believe that either the gospels (and the Bible) are literally true and thoroughly consistent, as he was taught, or that they are completely untrue. A subtle mind is needed to understand the Good Book, something Fleming sadly does not possess.

I admired that Fleming seems hell-bent on facing down the scars left by his fundamentalist education. It was courageous to enter the chapel where three times (after moments of doubt) he declared Jesus as his personal Savior. It was brave (if a little theatrical) to now deny the existence of the Holy Spirit there. But it absolutely excruciating to watch him assault his old school principal with his new and heretical beliefs. I can understand the catharsis that Fleming was after, but his confrontation (with a restrained, if pained principal) was an adolescent fantasy of patricide that did not advance Fleming's thesis or argue well for his maturity.

I was disappointed by interviews taken out of context. Barbra Mikkelson, of the wonderful, legend-busting Snopes.com, weighed in to say that certain fictional stories, when heard by new listeners, are told as true. By extension, Fleming suggests, fictional stories about a crucified messiah, when heard years later, were taken as (pardon me) gospel. Certainly, it is not impossible that this kind of human error skewed the transmission of stories about Jesus. But Fleming's claim that the Jesus stories are fiction relies heavily on the belief that for 35+ years after his death, everyone forgot about Jesus, and that around 70AD, a new batch of listeners heard the stories as true. This completely ignores the existence of Jesus's apostles (whom even Paul admits to meeting) and a church community that personally knew Jesus and transmitted his story, however imperfectly.

""The God Who Was Not There"" is a ""cri de coeur"" from a young man wounded by a twisted experience of faith. But he is in error to declare that the truth must be the polar opposite of whatever he was taught, and that everything he learned as a student, including the very existence of Jesus, was utterly false. Let's hope that as he matures, Fleming does not make the mistake of others who held passionate, if erroneous, beliefs while young, and that he learns more nuanced way of understanding Jesus and the gospels.",1329436800,2,5265,4.979522184300341
2454704,1,B000CAPZBC,"Introduction:

I had read reviews of this film that claimed it was excellent. I was hoping for an objective presentation of facts about the historical plausibility of Jesus. I wanted to know both sides of the discussion, that of Secular scholars and that of Christian scholars.

Sadly, this is not what was presented.

The film does point out the time gaps between when Jesus was supposed to have lived and when the gospels were written, but the film maker does not cite his sources... and they are easy to find, even on the Internet! These gaps, and his reliance on the writings of Paul, lead to his assertion that most of what is told about Jesus must therefore have been invented. Unfortunately, this is not presented or refuted by any scholars. So it is just the film maker's opinion. This lacks a certain objectivity.

And while the historical gaps leading to Jesus being ""invented"" could be true, without any evidence to back his claims, or a reason given as to why anyone would invent a ""god"", let alone one who has become so popular, the film maker falls short of what a documentary should do, that is: present facts and evidence.

The Plot:

Please note: The rest of this review contains spoilers.

He spends some time comparing Jesus to acknowledged mythical god figures such as Osiris, Dionysus, Hercules and Mythras. He concludes that because there are parallels (some of which aren't very exact), that therefore, Jesus is also mythical. But circumstantial evidence and innuendo are not proof. For example:

My dog looks like my neighbor's dog, same breed, same coloring, same age, same gender. So, if the neighbor's dog goes missing, can my neighbor say he has proof that I have his dog because of the above similar characteristics? Obviously more evidence is required to make the case.

And so it is with the ""mythical"" Jesus argument as presented in this film when it is based so poorly on parallels with known mythical figures.

While this stuff is all weak, and shows a lack of proper scholarship (even a few footnotes would have helped), the film gets worse.

The filmmaker presents the life of Jesus as portrayed in some Hollywood movies. That's insulting to Christians and Atheists alike. Very disappointing. This is supposed to be a serious discussion, not a rehash of some of the cheesiest films about Jesus ever made (and some of the clips are laughable in their own right because the films are so bad.)

The film also blatantly misquotes Jesus, and this is more than a faux pax. It is inexcusable in a documentary that is supposed to be arguing for truth and objectivity. The quote is from the gospel of Luke, Chapter 19. Anyone can look it up in any number of versions of the Bible (even on line) and see that the quote is taken completely out of context! If people argue that some Christians ""cherry pick"" the Bible, then it is a very weak counter-argument when you do the exactly same thing!

We also get treated to a rather long series of unauthorized (not good for establishing scholarship when you pirate something) clips from the Mel Gibson movie, ""The Passion of the Christ"", which the film maker claims was a hugely successful movie because of its violence. I did not see the Mel Gibson movie because I don't like torture porn films - such as this was reported to be - and I had to skip this section of ""The God Who Wasn't There"" because such scenes are so disturbing to me. There was no reason to show the clips (he could have just referenced the movie and avoided copyright infringement) to make his point.

But even his point was unsubstantiated. He claimed that the movie grossed more money than ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""The Temptation of Christ"" (both of which I DID see because they weren't gore fests), but did not take into account inflation, publicity, social and audience expectations, or film history. His point was that Christians gladly embrace violence because the Mel Gibson movie did so well at the box office. This assumes that the majority of the people who went to the movie were Christians, and that they went for the gore and violence. Without evidence to back up that assertion, it comes down to looking like using sensationalism to prove an argument.

There is no question that the history of Christianity is riddled with violence of a terrible nature. We have historical evidence (such as the Spanish Inquisition and the burning of heretics - all documented events) but Christianity does not have an exclusive license to violence. Inhumanity of the most atrocious nature can be found in almost all cultures and religions. The question that would have been interesting to address is why humanity has such a proclivity for violence and more importantly, why Christianity doesn't take a much stronger stance against violence, rather than embrace it by recommending or attending slasher Jesus movies.

Finally, the film suffers meltdown at the end when the film maker interviews the leader of a Christian School (which the film maker attended). I was hoping for an objective discussion. In parts we do get the leader's opinion and beliefs, but then the film maker argues with him and tries to make him look irresponsible, at which point, the man ends the interview because what was being filmed and what he was told would be filmed are two different things. I don't blame him for leaving, I did too! I skipped through to the end and sighed, ""What a waste of time and money.""

I have seen the movie ""Religulous"" which makes the same mistake. In that movie, the film maker encounters people of faith, asks what they believe, and then proceeds to argue with them about what they believe - which gets them into trouble. ""The God Who Wasn't There"" does this as well, which is embarrassing to watch.

I would much rather have seen the film maker interview people of faith, listen to their beliefs, then say ""Thank you"" and leave them alone. If their beliefs are absurd, there is no need to argue with them. The absurdity should be obvious. If they are profound, that too should be obvious. Let the audience decide, and at least give both sides of the story objectively.

Conclusion:

I was hoping of a scholarly, objective, rational and scientific approach to understanding the history of Jesus, why he may or may not have existed as an historical person. I knew this film would argue that he wasn't historical, and that would have been fine, if there were any objective, supportable arguments given. But they were not.

Personally, I thought the film was disappointing and at times, embarrassing. It could have been so much better.",1328918400,7,6584,4.762949956101844

Pretty much anyone with a pulse and at least 3 active brain cells will find this an illuminating and deeply disturbing experience.

Anyone in search of the truth will be better of going on youtube to watch the countless videos debating Christianity and validity of the bible and Jesus.

The documentary starts of by talking about how early Christians believed for hundreds of years that the sun revolved around the earth. Mr. Flemming does not provide any sources to show where this is written in the bible or where this has been the fundamental teaching of Christianity. Yes some ancient people in the church held that belief but that is not strong enough point to use in a debate with a brainwashed individual or even to debate with a so called Biblical scholar.

From there the DVD goes into what I call the Mystery Science Theater 3000 sequence. It shows cut scenes from different vintage religious movies in order to explain the story of Jesus birth. I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud. This goes on for maybe 10 minutes then Mr. Flemming provides the viewer with information about the time frame gap between when Jesus supposedly was on earth and when the
first gospel of the new testament was written. The is one of maybe 2 times during this entire documentary where Mr. Flemming gives the viewer real useful
information. the rest of the documentary shows Mr. Flemming talking to some Christians and asking them basic questions. I actually  felt sorry for those people they looked like mindless drones, they couldn't even answer a simple question as how did Christianity spread. The documentary felt like the zeitgeist movie (cheap and easily debunked). Mr. Flemming does not talk to, nor does he debate with any real Biblical scholars unless you consider the foolish principle a scholar.

Mr. Flemming uses things like the virgin birth, Jesus being born on December 25 etc to compare this to other ancient messiah like figures in order to prove Jesus is a fraud. Again Mr. Flemming does not provide any source material. No where in the bible does it say Jesus was born in December. If one reads the ancient manuscript they would see that the word almah (maiden) is used not bethulah (virgin). He does not even talk about the problem with the genealogy of this so called Jesus. if you are going to debunk Christianity at least use hard hitting fact not things that can easily disputed.

This documentary would have been better if Mr. Flemming explained with detail the contradictions in bible. How the Bible conflicts with historical events etc etc etc.  If you are a person who has been brainwashed to believe in a religious savoir I recommend doing independent research rather than buying this crap DVD. you are better of Searching in Google for Who Wrote the Bible?

I liked the very in-depth details he brought up about dates in history and how they correspond with the bible. He made some interesting points about the lack of knowledge and information about the time after Christ as well.

Just when I was really starting to find his data credible, he ended the movie with an interview that bombed it for me. The man who runs the Christian School he attended growing up agreed to talk on camera with him. When he realized he had been duped into a debate on religion, he said that he was not going to continue because he (the films creator) was just doing this because he was ""angry for being punished"" for something he had done while attending school there. If the director had mentioned anything about what that issue from the past was, it might have lended more credibility to the film. But since nothing about this was mentioned, it leaves one wondering if he really just getting back at the school.

What was this thing that happened and why doesn't he mention it to clear up that this is not the issue at hand? It seems an important thing to include if your trying to de-bunk 2000+ years of religious history. Ending the film without this tiny bit of information left me feeling that this was nothing more than an angry former student from this school who wanted to publicly tell them all that they were wrong.

What saves this movie from being a 2 star and brings it up to a 3 star is the on-camera interviews with other authors. They all have very interesting and knowledgeable points of view on the subject. So it's worth watching, but I would say rent this, don't buy it.",1318636800,4,1689,4.4772727272727275
2454710,3,B000CAPZBC,"I too, came to this DVD, in the hope that it would be a satisfying and interesting examination of the ""facts"" surrounding the early years of Christianity, the writing of the Christian Gospels, and the examination of any existing archeological evidence for Jesus Christ in the first place. Whilst I found the presentation of the above topic areas to be fairly well presented/explained, for a general audience, I felt more detail could have been presented in the interesting area of the similarity of some of the ""Pagan"" Deity's, such as Mithras, Osiris, Prometheus and the like, but overall I felt that this part was reasonably well done, after all a few Internet searches is all one needs these days.

Where I felt that Brian Fleming went a bit ""off the beam"" was his treatment of the school Pastor, Dr Ronald Sipus? from Mr Flemings old Christian school, this part had me feeling sorry for the pastor, and I was cringing in my seat. This almost seems to me to be a ""cheap shot""  and could have been better handled, it's like blaming the Janitor for the sins of the CEO's and corporate heads? I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of a discussion about the ""brainwashing"" methods of fundamentalist ""cults"", how they keep people in a state of control, through fear, financial issues, and the like, but that's going pretty far into other areas.

Perhaps a run down of contemporary areas of Theology, covering Gnosticism, mystery religions and esoteric Judaism, is a bit of an ask for a general documentary such as this, I would say that it was entertaining overall and moved along at a good pace, but by the time the films ends I was left wanting more, it seemed to just peter out a bit.

Good supplementary material, and extended interviews with Robert M. Price, richard Carrier and Sam Harris redeems the ending somewhat. I quite enjoyed the music by DJ Madison, David Byrne! Thievery Corporation, Zap Mama and Le Tigre, and thought it was not distracting!",1316563200,2,1966,4.739766081871345
2454711,2,B000CAPZBC,"I recently watched this documentary on Netflix and found it quite sad, as documentaries go. Honestly I don't spend much time thinking about religion in my own life because I'd rather be learning something useful, but I suppose my belief lies somewhere between atheist and agnostic. I watched this video with the hopes of learning something interesting and (as a sadly uninformed person in this area) I did learn a thing or two. Unfortunately this movie really fell short as some other reviewers mentioned. Poorly made, really cheesy music and distracting ""special effects."" If he had stuck with the facts (which are very interesting!) instead of turning it into what felt like his personal revenge against his childhood school (he's a former fundamentalist christian), this could have been a decent documentary. As one person mentioned here- if this were presented as a community college project it would have received an A......but this wasn't a college project! As I said, it does have a few good points- if you're really uninformed about the beginnings of christianity then you'll learn a few things. Also, the interviews and commentary by the handful of well educated folks (who he unfairly compared to misinformed ""everyday"" christians) was insightful and I think I'll be looking into the various books they have written. I can't comment on the DVD extra/bonus material because I didn't actually buy the movie. I also agree that the final interview with his former school principal was really done in poor taste and I honestly felt a little sorry for the guy (aren't we supposed to think HE'S the bad guy?!) Anyway, I'm no expert on the subject or a film critic by any means, but my personal recommendation is: don't buy this.....watch it on netflix, but don't have too high of hopes. Can someone out there please make a more insightful and professional documentary on this subject? I think a lot of people would appreciate this and who knows, maybe it would even open some minds out there.

2454712,5,B000CAPZBC,"If it were possible to give this DVD a 6 star rating, I would.

This isn't a big Hollywood production. It's not an expensive network Documentary piece.

Rather, it's a personal project created by a young man who use to be a Theist and then woke up! And is now an atheist. And in the process of arriving at his personal revelation, he decided to make a DVD documenting where he'd been, with an interview with his former Christian school Principle, who was also his former Pastor, so as to explain the journey to arriving at atheism.

The Pastor in this piece is the best part. There he sits in his office, in the Christian school he runs, his desk and comfortable office chair situated before a wall of credentials. All framed so as to silently communicate in writing, this is a man who knows what he's talking about. And in that the guest to his chamber, sitting in a smaller less comfortable chair stationed before the Pastors desk, is intended to be intimidated, assured, confident that behind that Pastors head is framed proof on display that they can trust every word he says, as a emissary of his lord god.

And in the course of the interview with Mr. Flemming, that Pastor admits, when asked if he believes the Jesus of the Bible did actually exist, that it is a matter of faith for all Christians that he did.

A matter of faith! I.E. Christians hope he did exist. They believe he did exist.

However, faith precludes fact. And there is no non-Biblical independent evidence that the Jesus described in the Bible, did in fact exist.

Then Mr. Flemming continues in the interview with his former Pastor and building upon that aforementioned statement regarding faith Jesus did exist, the Pastor says, in order to be a Christian one has to set aside the intellect.

POW! Truth! Spoken by a man who's pride mounts for all to see, his credentials so that on sight one is to take him at his word in all matters of faith and god, since he's so obviously a learned man.

In other words, one has to dumb down, revoke critical, rational, thought in order to accept the myth of Christ and Christianity as true.

No kidding!

And yet true enough, that Pastor back peddles just as soon as Mr. Flemming repeats what the Pastor said about setting aside the intellect. He denies he said it.

What cowardice. Especially when the interview was being recorded and Mr. Flemming offered to rewind the video and show him where the Pastor had spoken those words.

After quite some time spent denying his words, proving himself not a man of his word, not mature enough to accept responsibility for his former statement, even going to the extent of accusing Mr. Flemming of ulterior motives in asking for the interview in the first place, which has no bearing whatsoever on the Pastors former statement about having to set aside the intellect in order to be a Christian, the Pastor ends up walking out of his own office, in outrage!

Priceless!

I use to attend a Christian school. For 2 years, I witnessed hypocrisy, egoism, elitism and physical violence. All exhibited in the name of insuring one faith's supremacy in the mind and heart of impressionable young minds.

It's like any other MONO-Theistic faith. IF there is only one god, then there can be no other god's before or after or in competition with it. If there is only one, then no other faith, no other rituals, no other sect of believers be they afforded any name as such, can worship anything other than that one.

So that all the fighting, all the elitist proclamations by Fundamentalist, Evangelical and now what's worse than them, Dominionists (Aka/New Apostolic Reformationists) is simply a war of words. A conflict for supremacy of Semantics!

And to think of all the lives lost, the bloody slaughter, the loss of cultural histories, languages, writings, etc... due to that battle to have ""The One"" referred to by only one religious ideology; Christianity. That in and of itself, is not and never has been a religion of peace, for all the infighting that occurs among Christians in the name of sectarianism. One god, one way to see god, one way to worship god, or else!

This video is an awesome revelation. It's produced by a young man who sought the truth for himself. Found it, and then thought to make a video offering an opportunity to review the Christian faith and it's god, and decide for ones self, as the viewer, if any of Christianity (Or Theism in general) makes sense.

With regard to Christianity, no! It does not. In a nutshell, Christianity declares the individual was declared guilty of sin before they were born. And once alive they were forever in deficit and deemed imperfect by their creator. Always guilty, they have to struggle to be redeemed, forgiven, for being made as the infinite omnipotent creator of all that is, made them to be before they were conceived.

(NIV)Psalm 51:5) Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.

So that salvation is simply a journey to find god, in his demi-god form of Jesus, so as to ask him to save us from the damnable sinners he made us to be. Salvation is asking to be saved from god. Because left unredeemed, unsaved, one dies as a sinner and thus suffers the Hell of his creation. Where he deems the damned sinners to suffer for all eternity.

If god couldn't forgive the first of our kind, Adam and Eve, for their first mistake as newborns in his created Paradise, having eaten of ""forbidden"" fruit that god planted there in the first place, how can he generations later, and after having drowned the whole world, save for one family, for being sinners, send himself to rearrange the rules of damnation that he wrote himself?

If god is god, why did he create humans imperfect and then curse them for his mistake?

I agree with that spineless Pastor who couldn't even admit to his own words, much less then be deemed fit to lead anyone to be better people from the pulpit; one has to set aside the intellect, in order to be a Christian.

This DVD is a must have for any atheist. And it's an opportunity to awaken from selective ignorance, for any Christian.

Look at the world as it stands now. Nearly 7 billion individuals inhabit it, the majority of which are Christian. War, poverty, famine, pandemic AIDS, suffering, etc...
All those people who believe in god, pray for salvation, pray for grace, pray to be saved from their present mortal plight.

Does it appear anything is listening? And if it were, does it appear as if it cares?

NO!

There's an answer for why.
People are begging to be saved by the God who ISN'T there!

Save yourself.

Stop believing in poorly written fictions that can't even save you from dumbing down in order to hope it's true in the end. While agreeing to be dumb, to set aside your personal intelligence and rationalization skills,  in order to live it as truth at all.",1315785600,6,6850,4.611522633744856

In studying the various religions, I found not just tremendous similarity, but historical precedents.  These ideas started long ago and evolved.  It is completely consist with the concept of folklore and storytelling.  All art originates as primitive, and evolves to the sophisticated.  Painting, music, etc.  And it evolves as society wants it to evolve.

What I enjoyed about this doc was how it show the ancients stories of gods and how they got spun by storytellers, who added a little here, tweaked it there.  It was re-written over the years - improved, elaborated, embellished, etc.

Not unlike, say, blues music which is something that was well documented.  These songs were picked up and changed and tweaked along the years.  Who originally wrote many of them is hard to say - lyrics were added, dropped, changed or modified.  And eventually it morphed into rhythm & blues, folk music, gospel, rock 'n roll and hard rock.

And it is in this regard that I find this documentary fascinating.  As a screenwriter,  I'm fully aware of how stories start and snowball.  Religion works the same way.  It takes elements of truth and mixes in what people want to hear.",1315353600,3,1339,4.845132743362832

2454716,5,B000CAPZBC,"Accurately describing the essential beliefs of modern American Christianity, and respectful to the Christians he interviewed, Brian Flemming hits on some of the puzzling dogma believed on faith. The film doesn't go into battle over issues that currently grab attention, such as the debate over evolution/creationism, nor does it spend much time on the eras of Christian history that believers themselves agree weren't so hot (e.g. the Inquisition) nor on the actions of well-known Christians with controversial reputations (e.g. Jimmy Swaggart). In other words, the film isn't an angry diatribe against action taken under the guise of Christianity. Instead, it focuses attention on pieces of Christian tenets that both believers and non-believers may not have considered.  The film asks ""do Christians realize that Paul, whose letters were written within the lives of Jesus' contemporaries (unlike the Gospels) didn't think Jesus lived on Earth?"" and contains almost none of the stories we think of as basic Christianity.  How about the fact that  Jesus' accepted biography duplicates the biographies of earlier pagan Gods? a fact that Justin Martyr (early apologist, writing roughly A.D. 130) admits.  And much more. The film is refreshing because while it clearly holds a position, it doesn't challenge Christian dogma with atheist dogma. Instead it takes a lively close-up look at Christian beliefs themselves and asks reasonable but challenging questions. It's a film that would be a relatively gentle opener to begin a conversation about doubt if a Christian friend/relative is trying to convert you.",1310169600,4,1605,5.48582995951417

Millions of people have enough ""faith"" or confidence in their religious convictions to believe that a random series of fables that were dreamed up by ""divinely inspired,"" non-eye witness ""prophets"" during the Bronze Age to explain things they did not understand are somehow factual historical truths to be taken literally.  There is no actual evidence to base this belief on, but that is what faith means, the ability to suspend intellectual rationality. The ability to ignore scientific facts, even when they are obvious, if they are inconsistent with one's preexisting religious beliefs is considered an attribute, one that is also paramount in perpetuating the myths of faith from generation to generation. The worst thing that a religious person can do is to allow themselves to consider asking logical questions about why they believe what they believe. In fact, they are taught to be afraid to think about alternative answers - because God wouldn't like it.  The absurdity of this illogical relationship between people and Christianity is the subject of this film.

2454718,1,B000CAPZBC,"I guess I always thought a Fundamentalist Christian was one who based their lives (usually) on a literal translation/understanding/application of the Bible.  Seems to me that if you were ""born again"" on 3 occasions as a child in a Christian School you were probably not a Fundamentalist Christian of any sort.  I am confused why you would represent yourself as a fundamentalist Christian simply based on attending a Christian school.  There is no detail as to why the creator of this documentary puts himself in that category.

The ""facts"" were presented haphazardly and typically with no historical reference.  Scripture was often quoted out of context and once the wrong scripture was referenced altogether.  Granted, the quoted scripture was in fact in the Bible further on in Leviticus, but from a scholarly standpoint your credibility typically gets shot up when you aren't presenting the material correctly.  I find people in today's age tend to think information was as fast moving and plentiful as it is today or has been for the past century.  It is not that strange that it took many years for any written text about Jesus to appear.  There were no blogs or IM's to instantly annotate some event happening.  And the death of one Jewish man in a city under Roman rule was hardly big news in those days, even if that man was claiming to be the Savior of mankind.  And I am pretty certain that anything that was written down in those days didn't immediately become historical documentation that was set aside for preservation for future generations to read, unless it was written by some local or regional ruler.

But I digress, people believe what they want to believe and rally around those whose thought process most closely mimic theirs.

As a Christian, this movie doesn't move me to turn my back on my Creator.  For most Christians it may actually spark some interest in the history of their faith, both good and bad, so as to understand it better.  It might help them out when some random person asks them seemingly innocuous questions to be used in an unfavorable light later on.

As a former atheist, this movie would probably help affirm some of the more cookie cutter views of the atheist community, but I don't see it making any great strides to put Christians on the run.  I remember being smug in my non-belief and I definitely sensed that in this movie.

2454720,1,B000CAPZBC,"This movie is grossly inaccurate. If you want to critique Christianity, okay, but at least present accurate information. This documentary is hinged on three main points 1) the director claims that Paul only knew about the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus 2) the director claims that Jesus is just a rehashed story of pagans that came before 3) the director claims that Christianity is responsible for atrocities in the past because their actions was actually weaved into Christian doctrine.

For starters, the director doesn't use not one single scripture in this movie in its proper context. All three claims made by the director are false! Here's why! 1) The directors first claim is false because just a little bit of Bible knowledge will teach you that Luke the writer of the Gospel of Luke was Paul's scribe. It is narrow-minded to believe that Paul didn't know of the life of Jesus if his on scribe authored an entire Gospel! 2) The directors second claim is false as well, there are some similarities between pagan gods and Jesus, however, the framework for Jesus' life was laid out in the Old Testament, most of how Jesus came to be and the things he did were prophesied in the Old Testament long before most of those pagan gods mentioned in this dvd were even thought of, if anything Judaism influenced the pagans. As taken from one source on the topic says ""Remember, an agriculturally based society, as was the people of the ancient Mediterranean area, will undoubtedly develop theological themes based upon observable events, i.e., the life, death, and seeming resurrection of life found in crops, in cattle, and in human life.""* 3)The director's third claim makes one of his most flabbergasting claims where he states that atrocities of the past can to be because of Christian doctrine. This is just not true. Christian doctrine is rooted in love, not hatred and not death. The director tries to use one scripture but the scripture he used is grossly taken out of context. Look at Matthew 5-7, what is affectionately known by some as the ""Sermon on the Mount,"" Jesus teaches us to love our enemies, to go the extra mile, to turn the other cheek, Jesus taught us love, he told Peter to put his sword up because if you live by the sword you die by the sword. It is shameful to take the actions of a few misguided people who claimed to be Christians and label the whole bunch, it is even more disgusting to label the doctrine as a whole because of these individuals. The bulk of Christians have helped to make the world a better place, we must realize that any group of people has its bad apples, but judgements that the director makes by looking at a few is simple incorrect.

The filmmaker himself tries to push his atheist ideas on believers to question their faith . My question is Why ? What for ? People are free to decide to believe in God or not .

There was a historical Jesus as noted and written  down by ancient historians such  as Josephus  1 st c AD, The Roman historian Tacitus 1st c  AD also  Pliny  who was the Roman governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor. Even in the Jewish Talmud the Jews make reference to Jesus even though they do not believe him to be the messiah they acknowledged a real Jesus at the time existed  .Quote ; On the eve of the Passover Yeshu was hanged. Let me ask a question here .. do you think normal people hundreds of thousands  at the time with random  persecutions going on in the Roman empire would gladly die ""peacefully non violently ""in the arenas or tortured and burned  at the hands of their accusers if they did not really  believe in Jesus ? or maybe ,prehaps  had revelations to them from the holy spirit ,,.Yet they died willingly . Why because they believed in something real and had faith  .Do not confuse modern Christianity with  the real early apostolic  Christianity  .

2454723,1,B000CAPZBC,"A Review of ""The God Who Wasn't There""

 I recently had the opportunity to watch this documentary.  I believe it is important for us to examine the evidence.  As Socrates once stated:  ""An unexamined life is one that is not worth living.""  Surely that is the case as we try to build upon a philosophical foundation of what we believe to be the one true worldview - whether it be atheism, Christianity, Islam, etc.  Which worldview correspondes with true reality?  Which one has the most coherence and is logically compatible?  As I watched this documentary, my faith in Christianity was not shaken in any instance because I had done my research on these matters that Mr. Flemming reported.  Let me offer some plausible answers to two of his challenges to the Christian faith.  I would also encourage you to check out [...] and [...] for further investigations.
 1) One of the things that Flemming made a mistake in was his abuse of the Scriptures.  For example, let us look at the context of Mark 3:22-30:  ""And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, ""He has Beelzebub,"" and, ""By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."" So He called them to Himself and said to them in parables: ""How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.  And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.  And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.  No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.  ""Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation""-- because they said, ""He has an unclean spirit.""
 First, notice that Jesus was able to cast out the demons by the power of the Spirit of God.  Second, notice the Pharisees (a majority of the group who were enemies of Jesus) attribute His miraculous power to Satan.  Third, Jesus defeats their assertion in that He logically explains why would Satan want to fight against his own allies?  That makes no sense!  Third, notice Jesus states there is forgiveness (preceded by repentance and obedience to the gospel - belief in Jesus as the Savior, repentance of mind and conduct, confession of His name, and being baptized for the remission of sins - John 3:16; Mt. 10:28,29; Lk. 13:3,5; Acts 2:38; Gal. 3:26-29; Rom. 6:3,4; Col. 2:12,13)  by Jesus.  He stated though that there will be no forgiveness if one blasphemes against the Holy Spirit.  To blaspheme means to injure.  These Pharisees had insulted, injured the name of the Holy Spirit, attributing His power to Satan's as Mark goes on to explain the reason for their condemnation - because they said, ""He has an unclean spirit.""  Fourth, we must recognize today that miracles were served for the purpose of revealing the New Testament during the 1st century A.D.  We know that as Peter states that we have all things that pertain to life and godliness (2nd Pet. 1:3).  1 Cor. 13:8-10 and Eph. 4:7-16 give us great evidence that these miracles would cease before the end of the first century since it was only the apostles who received the baptism of the Holy Spirit that endowed them with miraculous power (Acts 2:1-4) and they were only given the ability to pass on to Christians in the first century (Acts 8:14-16).  Listen closely to Heb. 6:4-6:  ""For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.""
 First, notice the Hebrews writer is writing to an audience of 1st century Christians who ""have become partakers of the Holy Spirit"" and ""have tasted...the powers of the age to come.""  It seems likely that these Christians had received miraculous gifts from the apostles.  They had fallen away from God because they had gone back to Judaism instead of staying forth in Christianity.  They must have blasphemed the Holy Spirit in that they pronounced their miraculous abilities must had come from Satan instead of the Holy Spirit.  Can one commit the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit today?  If there are no more miracles today, then it seems like someone couldn't.
 But perhaps someone who is reading God's Word and come across Jesus and the miracles that He performed.  Only true, genuine miracles can proceed forth from God.  As Nicodemus stated:  """"Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him."" (John 3:2).  It seems to be the case that the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be committed today since we are not eyewitnesses of genuine miracles today.  For further information on this topic, please visit:  [...] and [...].  We should understand that these miracles were performed to enhance one's faith in the deity of Christ (John 20:30,31).  It certainly is the case that the Talmud, not a friend to Christianity, gives historical credence to Jesus' miracles and attributing them to magic/witchcraft.  A reference to Jesus' amazing works was also described in one section of the Babylonian Talmud (known as the Sanhedrin Tractate) where Jewish leaders wrote, ""On the eve of the Passover Yeshu [Jesus] was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, `He is going forth to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to apostasy....' But since nothing was brought forward in his favour he was hanged on the eve of Passover"" (Shachter, 1994, 43a).  What is more important though is that Jesus  desires us to come to know Him and to be in His church that He bought with His own blood because He wants to save us from our sins (Matt. 11:28-30; Acts 20:28; 1 Tim. 2:4).
 2) Mr. Flemming in a interview on Fox news ([...]) stated these words in which were also his point in his documentary.  Notice what he says in the YouTube video in which the newscaster asked him why he was doing this and Flemming responds in 1:16 stating:  ""Well if parents are going to terrorize their children with religious indoctrination, then I think it is important to reach those children to let them know there is nothing to be afraid of...""  He goes on to state:  ""[children] are innocent victims..."" He believes that teaching Christian doctrine is ""psychological torture"".  Mr. Flemming's view on ""religious tyranny"" as he puts it seems to him from his statements that what Christians are doing is IMMORAL.  In a naturalistic worldview, how could morals or ethics fit into the coherency of this worldview?  Who is to say that it is wrong or right to do such and such (stealing, lying, murder, etc.)?  Do atoms make up the standard?  Mr. Flemming is attacking the Christian worldview, but he is using one of the strong pillars of the Christian worldview , which is one of the arguments (the moral argument) for the existence of God to help stand on his own platform at to why he is doing this documentary.  Friends, think logically about this matter.  If there is no God, there is no ultimate standard of morality and ethics.  There is no true right or wrong.  Everything is permissible.  Yet, Mr. Flemming wants us to believe that this is immoral.  How could it be immoral if the atheistic worldview is true (which can account for no standard of morals or ethics)?  Therefore, Mr. Flemming is implicitly by his own agenda instead supporting the Christian worldview rather than the naturalistic worldview.
 I do pray that if Mr. Flemming does read this or anyone else that I hope you will consider what I have stated.  I do want people to come to the knowledge of the truth - Christianity is the only true religion of the one true God.

They ask the hard questions and unfortunately they don't really get answered because the second they ask the hard questions they get kicked out! LOL",1307059200,4,297,4.730769230769231
2454725,1,B000CAPZBC,"I am a Christian. I watched this ""documentary"" on Netflix, because I alwasy watch them to see what's being touted as the next ""big"" argument against my faith. In this particular film, the mocking is on full blast - especially with the splicing of old Jesus movies to tell ""the old story"". And at the end, when the director ""confronts"" his old school and enters his old church building and ""confesses"" he does not believe. If that was the point to this film (which I don't doubt), this should have been called, ""God Wars Episode V: The Atheist Strikes Back"". At least it would have an honest title. Yeah, I used sarcasm.

The argument in the film is that Jesus is just another ""heroe"" like the Greek gods who share common storylines. Employs interview materials from ""academia"" and fringe Jesus scholars (Jesus Seminar) to make the case that a fictionaal story (Glurge) of a person by the name of Jesus essentially became a ""historic"" person with a ""historic"" story. And I used to have such respect for scopes.com, but they enter the fray of this mockumentary. He goes on, stacking Jesus 3rd among the heroes. These are not even new arguments. And yet the cover and website portray this information as new.

The ""Christian on the Street"" interviews though done ""nicely"" would have been really properly complimented by at least an educated response. At least Ben Stein interviewed actual top notch scholars from the scientific community he was confronting for the ""conspiracy"" to ""expell"" scientists who believe in an Intelligent Designer. Meanwhile, the film attacks Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, documenting minute per minute when the blood, violence on Christ, or suffering of Christ.

The reality of the bloody nature of what a roman crucifixion would look like is not even talked about. Its only used to build his flimsy case that Christians are blood hungry. Seriously? That's an argument to disbelieve in Christianity... a movie portrayal of what a roman scourging and crucifixion looked like? Logically, it doesn't work, emotively it leaves you thinking. In the end, it's a failure.

The discussion on biblical teaching would be laughable if it weren't so serious. And because there are some people who believe in a rapture, then therefore they are a dangerous part of the electorate, and intimates that they should not be allowed to vote. Moreover, it suggests that biblical scholars publishing on ""what they believe to be a respectable publisher"" are publishing lies.

The best real discussion comes from Sam Harris. I don't agree with him obviously, but at least he is intelligent in his critical thinking. I think his investment in atheism is unfortunately, at least I can hope and pray that he follows Antony Flew's footsteps and sees the evidence for a Designer. But Mr. Harris in principle my be irritated at my faith-based ""good will"", which for him is too dangerous to be used in my civic decisions (and yours too if you have them). But I wonder if Mr. Harris is fine with the director's ""deception"" with the principle of his old school as to the premise of their interview.

Well, this is all I have energy for... if this is all this director has, then his investment in liberal and fringe biblical studies which have been responded to by able mainstream scholars provides me with insufficient funds to cash out on my faith. I appreciate his courage to tell his story, but the film failed to deliver. Game over.",1306886400,3,3437,4.846678023850085

The producer / narrator of this movie takes scripture completely out of context in the most pathetic agenda driven of way. His dogma against and hatred of Christianity is as virulent and blind as any fundamentalist religious zealot is for Christianity. I waited forever to see an unbiased historical representation of the Christian religion and all I saw was a damaged man's diatribe full of lies and half truths and agenda driven drivel. The few scenes about ancient religions being the same as the Christ story were barely covered and nothing new from 100's of other books / movies in this milieu. His religion of hating religion is boooooring - and the attempt at the musical score making some emotional statement was hackneyed at best. The absolute JOKE of it all was his ""dramatic"" denial of the Holy Spirit in the chapel he attended as a boy... lame.

Too much time is spent on interviews (for such a short DVD) and not enough time is spent presenting ideas about the pagan antecedents of Christianity.  I'm sure that most people who have never heard of Dionysus, etc., were wondering what sort of arguments the makers of this DVD were trying to make.  For a very thorough discussion of the possible ""pagan"" connections to Christianity, I suggest reading ""Suns of God"", by Acharya S (Yes, that's the full name of the author!).  Although some of the references in that book might be questionable, there are PLENTY of books and authors quoted that can lead one to more solid ground.

I highly recommend it for the extras which contain more thorough interviews with Richard Carrier, the creators of snopes, and other scholarly sorts, but there doesn't seem to be an atheist documentary that really lays everything out in cogent way.",1294012800,2,583,4.615384615384615

Overall it was a good documentary, I enjoyed watching it.  I thought he did a good job with the historical references and found myself laughing at times at the animation.  I really liked the music, I've downloaded two songs by DJ Madson.  I also especially liked the interview with Bob Price and commentary by Sam Harris.  I'm giving the video a 3 star review however because I was taken aback by Brian Flemming's attack of the principal at the religious school he attended as a child.  What could have been a real opportunity for him to have an open and honest debate with the principal, ended up being a juvenile attempt at revenge in my opinion.  Brian was deceptive, and the tactic seemed sort of ""Michael Moore-ish"" in that the principal seemed cornerned and caught off guard.  I don't disagree with Brian's thoughts and concerns, and that he felt wronged by the school.  Heck I've been there!  Those were valid points, however I thought he was well to put it lightly a jerk the way he went about it.  I liked the very end where he went to the school chapel, I won't give it away but it was thought provoking and nicely done.

2454735,1,B000CAPZBC,"This is so laughable. Whoever is the one who put this retarded thing together is a blithering fool. The idiotic blunders they make are laughable, they think that they have caught Christianity off guard.
 This film is an absolute joke and comedy LAUGH OUT LOUD and then he says he was born again 3 TIMES which is impossible, Oh what laughable comedy this is. It is written, ""ONLY THE FOOL SAYS IN HIS HEART THERE IS NO GOD"". He even shows an image of himself denying the Holy Spirit so that the whole world can see what a fool looks like. The part where the fool was interviewing a Minister and then the Minister walks out on the fool is priceless comedy.
It is obvious that all the people shown in the film are Actors portraying Christians, they are all the film makers anti-Christ friends, even the minister who walks out on him is his friend. This is bogus film, that most likely didn't get permission to use the films it injects into it's slanderous lies, Like Mel Gibson's Passion Of The Christ and other popular films about Christ. I also don't understand why these non-believers use christian time tables as in BC and AD. It's dumb that these anti/christ people use the christian BC and AD. It's like they are acknowledging his birth or existence, contradicting themselves.
  This film is an example of how to twist scripture for your own comedy.
  Don't spend money on this, do as I did, borrow it from a friend who was fooled into spending money on this garbage and then laugh at the idiocy that spills forth. Save your money.

To my great disappointment, the vast majority of the film is not historical argument but an attack on Christians and their faith. I am saddened that this film, which could have been a useful educational tool, has been rendered useless. The only people who will appreciate it are those who despise Christians and enjoy seeing them portrayed as ignorant and prejudiced.

If I recommend that people avoid this film, I will seem like I am trying to keep them from seeing it. Instead, I will recommend that everyone see it. If you see it, you will understand how not to approach the subject. This film is a perfect model of how to alienate anyone except really mean spirited Christian haters who will likely accept its premise with no argument whatsoever. Really, don't take my word for it. Acquire the film. Watch it.

But whatever you do, do not try to use this film to impress upon a believing Christian that Jesus may not have been a historical figure. Showing them this film will only serve to alienate them and make it impossible for anyone to ever make the argument.",1278720000,13,1205,4.6745283018867925

2454742,4,B000CAPZBC,"This product has almost 300 reviews and it's hard to find anything new to say about it. That notwithstanding, here are my impressions.

The just over an hour long main feature is well produced and is very interesting. It seemed somewhat overambitious for the length. Producer/writer/narrator Fleming would have done better to stick with only one of his two themes - 1.) that Jesus is a mythical figure and 2.) Christian morality is deeply flawed.

Fleming comes off as somewhat of a jerk. A lot of the film seems unnecessarily Christian bashing in tone. He comes across as a disturbed man with an ax to grind and scores to settle. His interview with the superintendent (Sipus) of his former Christian school has every earmark of an ambush. It was just petty not to grant Sipus' request that the interview not be made public.

The special features are of great interest here. The interview with Robert Price is especially absorbing. I could listen to Price talk all day long. I don't know if he's on the lecture circuit or not but he should be. Some of the other extended interviews feature a lot of Bush fear mongering that seems silly in light of subsequent political events but are interesting nonetheless.

The commentary tracks were of less interest to me. They are recorded phone conversations played over the main feature but aren't really commentary on the feature as such. Indeed, the feature tended to distract from the commentary.

I also thought that Fleming showed much more of Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" movie than could have been defended as ""fair use"" but he seems to have gotten away with it.

Summing up, I recommend this DVD to believers and nonbelievers alike despite flaws.",1275264000,5,1703,4.815068493150685

I have yet to find any significant reason or argument to not believe that God and His son exist just as scripture says. Evolution is a lie. and mysticism has its own lies too. This film tries to do what has been tried over and over again for two thousand years. Its as if the Christian fathers missed something. The average christian does not know his history. If you show the average christian only questions and vague answers, you may get an atheist out of him.

2454746,2,B000CAPZBC,"This movie is full of claims, but very little evidence. The age old method of pointing out horrendous acts carried out by people who called themselves Christians and using this to support the claim that Christ didn't exist is just another example of the blind leading the blind.

Too bad that while painting Christians as tyrannical, blood thirsty fools, he didn't bother to mention the incredible acts of courage, sacrifice and good works done by organizations, missionaries and aid workers world-wide who risk their lives (many have died) on a daily basis to help others in need. The money went into making and promoting this misguided film could have fed, provided supplies and cared for hundreds of people.

Another method used in this film is the art of misdirection and stacking the game. Just because you don't like or agree with something in the Bible doesn't mean that the Bible should be tossed out or that it's not real. The producer used references and Bible passages that he knew some people already hate (because they probably contradict the viewers life-style) and made sure to include those in the film, this helped to ensure a ready-made audience of supporters looking for evidence to support what they wanted to hear. If you want to win over an enemy, just find an enemy you both have in common and guess what... now you have a potential friend or at least temporary peace.

As for the idea that many aspects and stories of Christ were based on ancient Myths that predated His birth, again claims were made by the films experts that can be easily debated. Just because you put a bunch of published experts in front of a camera, doesn't mean they know or speak the truth:

Please refer to: [...]

Another trick used is the ambush method where you walk up to someone on the street and ask them if they know the history of something, this of course is done after doing your own research, just in case they happen to ask you the same question. Again, someone's lack of knowledge doesn't prove God, Christ or the lunch I had last week didn't exist. Yet I am sure many will see this and say, ""you see... I knew it! They don't even know the film makers twisted version of history, This proves God's non-existence!"" This would be the equivalent of saying that since many don't know the origin, lyrics or meaning of the star spangled banner that the song shouldn't be sung or doesn't exist.

The real truth and reason for this film comes out when we see that the film maker had a bad experience in his youth. He obviously felt the need to get some form of closure and chose this film and career path to do it. He also wanted to take as many people with him on the path to vengeance, it's a lonely road to travel and also a self deceptive one.

What frightens me the most is not that he made this film, but that he used these amateur claims and methods to try to do away with a Historical figure and with intent to destroy and misrepresent the faith of many.

For all those who want to believe that everything we see around us came by chance and that we are nothing more than evolved ape men without any responsibility to help and care about others, this movie is for you. For the rest of us... if you still want to see it, don't spend the $24.98 retail, you can probably find it used for less than a dollar.

Swearing and talking about ""Satan's greasy c*ck"" IMO don't belong in an objective documentary.

Of all the interviews conducted by Flemming, those who supported his claims were scholars, authors, and professors. The Christians represented in this film were interviewed on the street Jay Leno-style. The one 'expert' interviewee on the pro-Jesus side was Flemming's school teacher. Flemming admits to lying to the superintendent about the nature of the interview.

For a filmmaker to create an objective documentary, he has to be willing to present both sides of the argument equally and in a neutral light. Flemming has created a film that is really no different than what the likes of Pat Robertson would do for 'his side.'

There could have been a lot more on the early history of Christianity, the huge variety of interpretations that fought for primacy in the early centuries just after the Jesus story got going, ie.

""The God"" is an entertaining trip through one former fundamentalist realization that everything he had been taught growing up was a bunch of BS.  Its like a moment from a sci fi movie when the main character realizes everything they know has been a lie.  You can feel the anger of betrayal in the end of the movie when Flemming confronts the school master at the religious school he attended as a child.

Children are naturally programmed to listen to adults and believe that adults have their best interests at heart.  When they come to realize that is all been a lie its a tough mental blow.

I particularly enjoyed the segment on Mel Gibson's The Passion of the showing how Christians are obsessed with blood sacrifice, and points out how The Passion of the Christ contains few very scenes that do not feature graphic violence or suffering and was more successful than any other previous film about Jesus.

Seeing the faces of the Jesus Freaks is enough to know that half of their minds have left the planet.  But if you still have any reasoning ability left in your head, give the film a go.

2454754,1,B000CAPZBC,"I rented this DVD because I was curious. I had seen it advertised all over the Internet using Google Adwords.

If nothing else, it certainly is amusing, but the scholarship presented here is so shoddy as to be ridiculous.

First, of all, one of the claims made here is that in the 40 years after the death of Christ, nothing happened, i.e. Christianity didn't grow.

Here's the problem here: if the creation of Christianity in the first century wasn't important, why did Nero consider Christians to be such a significant threat? After all, he is the one who blamed the burning of Rome on Christians. This led to the martyrdom of thousands who claimed to be Christian.

Then there is the way that this guy ambushes the head administrator at the Christian school he attended. Richard Carrier basically lies to get an interview with this administrator. When the administrator realizes he is being ambushed, he asks Carrier to leave.

Carrier comes across as being angry over having religion shoved down his throat. As someone who grew up in an authoritarian religious home, I understand how he feels. However, that was just never enough to make me walk away from God, just religion.

Finally, let's not forget that Carrier completely ignores the historical account written by Josephus. Any accurate and coherent discussion on this topic would have to include this important historian.

I am all for honest intellectual discussions on the topic of God, as long as they are respectful and devoid of name calling. This is neither.

I respect the right of others to believe whatever they want to. After all, where you spend eternity is a big decision. I just don't think it's fair to purposefully mislead others, and Richard Carrier is misleading others with this film. It is short on fact, and long on complaints about how he was forced to become a Christian.

Quite frankly, I would recommend anyone who is curious to watch it. Even with only a very basic fundamental knowledge of Christianity, which is what most Christians have, you'll be able to shoot down his arguments easily.",1264636800,2,2076,4.858356940509915

It didn't work. They used sloopy pseudoscholarship that's worth of the Weekly Word News. The real biblical scholars don't even invite people like this to the table for discussion and compare Christ Mythers methology to flat-earthism, holocaust-denial and moon landing skepticism....

I don't know why some atheists are soooo desperate for Jesus not to have existed? I also don't know why with muslim radicaliest terrorising the world that they spend so much time bashing Christianity and not islam?

The King James Version of the Bible (usually the harshest) reads, ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.""

He makes fun of some amiable, uneducated people, he talks to educated people who agree with him, and at all times adopts a patronizing attitude when he has no obvious qualification for doing so.

We gather that Brian used to be a fundamentalist Christian. Now he is the opposite. Yet he is still as narrow minded, dogmatic, and fatuous as he was before. His mind  has changed, but in other ways there is no sign of development. I wonder what C.S. Lewis would have done with him? Lewis would have been tough but not patronizing. What Brian does not appear to understand is that you have not answered a case until you haver answered it at it's strongest.

Why did he not go to the top Christian scholars and theologians and put his points to them? Did they refuse to see him? Or did he fear that they might be a little to good for him? Actually the best part of this dvd is the interview with Earl Doherty who is a real scholar.

Unfortunately, ""Zeitgeist"" too suffers from what ""The God that Wasn't There"" suffers in that religion in general, and Christianity in particular, is dismissed as some kind of a scam, a lie, when all the evidence really reveals is that there is so much more to the Christ story than what is commonly understood in a LITERALIST interpretation of Christianity. The truths revealed in the myth go far beyond the literalist interpretation. There is a misunderstanding of myth as being a ""fairy tale"", fiction, false or not true, but myth speaks to truths that are beyond full human comprehension. For those dismayed by this DVD, if it has hurt your faith--congratulations! If your experience is anything like my own, you have just begun the journey to true spiritual understanding reflected in the myths of Christology. The journey is thrilling, exhilarating. It is not necessary to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Everything you held dear about Jesus is still true, and much deeper and more profound a truth than you many have thought you have known.

The interviews are good because the participants are trained in this, but nothing new in them. Flemmings personal part just ends in being able to have a his interview object braking the conversation and him saying ""I don't beleive in the Holy Ghost"", which is hardly a very provocative or enlightening statement.

2454766,4,B000CAPZBC,"I was a little disappointed when I first watched this documentary.  I don't know what I was expecting, but I thought it was a bit dumbed down and focused too much on popular culture, but I think now that that was the point.  So many mainstream Christians get knowledge from movies about Christ like The Passion of the Christ.  The interviews of Christians outside the Billy Graham Crusade at the Rose Bowl explaining the life of Jesus and then struggling with ambiguities how they believe Christianity spread after Christ's death is the knowledge most Christians have about their faith.  Most people are not going to be historians of ancient times who will dive into their studies with questions that might put doubt into their beliefs.  I never wondered how the Christian religion spread, so the information produced in this documentary was very eye-opening.

Brian Flemming, who produced this film, was a student of Village Christian School in Sun Valley, California.  He learned that the one thing that was unforgivable and would send you to damnation was the denial of the Holy Spirit.  This caused Flemming great terror and anxiety when doubts crept into his mind.  In this film, he returns to the school and chapel that were the scenes of his fears.  He questions the Superintendent until the Superintendent begins to suspect a rat and leaves.  Then Flemming gets some closure at the chapel.  Before all that, these are the most important points I learned from this documentary.

A gap of 40 years exist between the life of Christ and the Book of Mark which documents his ministry.  The Apostle Paul who wrote about Christianity and sought Christian converts during this gap only knew of Jesus's death and resurrection.  He did not place these events on earth.  No one seemed to remember that Jesus lived on earth until the Book of Mark.

Folklore Professor Alan Dundes lists the 22-points of the mythological hero which uses Oedipus as the model.  Jesus shared 19 of these characteristics and, it was acknowledged at the beginning of the Christian church, that Jesus's story was similar to that of pagan gods told long before.  The explanation Christian leaders gave was that Satan foresaw Jesus and counterfeited his story through other pagan gods beforehand so his story would not be believed.

Other parts of the hour-long documentary discuss the military aspect of Christianity and the obsession with blood sacrifice.  With extremists being more in line with the literal translation of the Bible, where does moderate Christianity fit in?  Then there is the Rapture Letters guy.  He has a website where you can submit email addresses and he will send out emails when the Rapture comes explaining that the sender has gone to Heaven.  I can picture it:  ""It's Armageddon!?  Wait!  I need to get on my laptop so I can send out these emails!""

The bonus material includes extended interviews and ""commentaries"" with such people as ""The Jesus Puzzle"" author Earl Doherty, the ""Raving Atheist"" blogger and Richard Dawkins.  Actually, they aren't really commentaries but telephone interviews pasted together.  I don't know why the documentary needs to be playing in the background.  It's distracting.  In sum, this documentary was not earth-shattering, but it did bring up important points of which I was not aware and, for that, I  am glad I purchased it.

2454772,4,B000CAPZBC,"The God Who Wasn't There unequivocally questions whether Jesus was the son of God--and it goes further to say the least. The film spends time exploring whether or not Jesus ever even lived--although it stops short of any conclusive statement that Jesus was a mythical character. Needless to say, as someone else already noted, if you're a devout follower of someone like Rev. Pat Robinson, you should probably stay away from this movie. Although filmmaker Brian Flemming makes a clear effort to give equal time to those who preach about Jesus and believe in him, you can tell Flemming isn't truly interested in their side of the story. On the other hand, however, if you do want to gain some insight and information about the origins of Christianity that you may not have had before, then I recommend that you do watch this film.

At the beginning of this film we see the history of Christ but it's almost exclusively during the last one or two years of his life. There is his baptism by John the Baptist; the miracles Jesus is said to have performed; Jesus' entry into Jerusalem riding on a donkey; Jesus becoming furious with the financial traders at the temple; Jesus being sentenced to death and having to carry his own cross to the mountain where he is crucified. Flemming then gradually begins to make his case against the existence of Christ by noting that the earliest written accounts of Jesus came from Mark, Matthew, Luke and John--but since they were written at least forty years after Jesus died, Flemming wonders aloud in this film if these four men got their stories straight.

Brian Flemming also wastes little time in letting people know that he is no longer a devout Christian; now he doubts if Jesus even existed. Brian interviews some very well spoken people including historian Richard Carrier; Alan Dundes, Professor of Folklore at UC Berkeley; Scott Butcher, a devout Christian who believes Jesus is coming soon and Dr. Ronald Sipus, Superintendent of Village Christian Schools where Brian himself was a student some years ago. The interviews are presented in such a way that it's all very interesting even if I didn't agree with everything that everybody said. In addition, we also get brief film clips of religious leaders speaking including one film clip of Dean Wycoff of The Moral Majority; he equates homosexuality to murder and other sins.

Although Brian Flemming would have us all believe that Jesus was and remains fictional, that is something everyone has to decide for themselves. Flemming presents his case in a somewhat biased light, although one of the stronger parts of his case is that there aren't many writings at all about Jesus until a long period of time had elapsed after Jesus died. This does raise the question of the accuracy of the writings--did Mark, Matthew, Luke and John ever actually meet Jesus? We're left wondering; we just don't know for sure. We also learn that Paul never mentioned anything of Jesus' life except the crucifixion, the resurrection and the ascension. This lack of information from Paul could be one reason why so many Christians don't know much about the origins of their own religion.

As for the ending, I'm not giving that one away. However, I will say that there are one or two quick shockers that end the film with quite a punch!

The DVD has a few good extra features; the extended interviews are quite well done. We also get optional running commentary tracks from scientist Richard Dawkins and Earl Doherty.

The God Who Wasn't There is a very good documentary that examines whether or not Jesus was the Messiah and it spends a fair amount of time compiling its evidence that Christ might not have lived at all. While this film is clearly not for the devout and deeply religious Christian, it could make an impact on others who do want to examine these issues. Indeed, some of the factual evidence we get along the way is fascinating.",1248220800,4,3917,4.795555555555556

2454774,2,B000CAPZBC,"For having Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins plastered all over this DVD, I was absolutely disappointed to find a young man's personal vendetta with his old private school, opposed to new, thought-provoking insights on the subject of atheism and religion.

The information that Brian Flemming presents is the same ""Atheist 101"" regurgitated argument fodder that I hear a lot of young, so-called atheists use.  This is nothing new, especially to anyone who is attracted to this film for seeing the names of Harris and Dawkins.

I would recommend this film for those who are unaware of the idea that Jesus was basically plagiarized from ancient pagan religions, but I can't, because it is presented in such a snotty, biased manner.  For beginners in the subject, watch the first segment of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zeitgeist-The-Movie/dp/0930852591/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zeitgeist, The Movie</a>.  ""Zeitgeist"" explains ALL of the ideas presented in ""The God Who Wasn't There"" in a more mature and well-researched way.

One thing that could redeem this film would be the interviews, but even this seems to be lacking.  The first Christians that Flemming interviews are oblivious fish in a barrel who simply awkwardly laugh at the questions Flemming asks them.  We are then graced by a couple of professors who wouldn't mind plugging their books, then Sam Harris, who offers the only decent information in the whole movie.  Next we have the apocalyptic-web designer who Flemming compares to himself as he transitions to the climax of the film; an interview with the superintendent of Flemming's old, Christian private school.  This is the only somewhat provocative interview in the whole film, and it ends with Flemming immaturely attacking the principal with false assumptions.  Flemming obviously gets ahead of himself in this interview, as it is apparent that he has a grudge with the school.

The film ends with Flemming recording himself in his old school's chapel as he denies God.  Insert the title of my review here.  Does Flemming really expect thinking atheists are going to take him seriously and look past his problem with his school?  I hope not, because I saw this film as nothing more than a man's attack on his past...a past that wasn't even that bad.  I didn't buy this DVD to watch a man whine.

This product as a whole gets two starts.  1 for the movie, and about 3 for the special features with Harris and Dawkins, but save your money and buy their books for real stimulation.",1247529600,9,2544,5.178484107579462
2454775,3,B000CAPZBC,"Most of the core ideas presented in this film have been explored in literary fashion by others--and have been reviewed  & otherwise memorialized on Parallel Perspectives--but this cinematographic presentation represents the icing on a very heretical cake.

The film opens with an animated depiction of the sun revolving around the earth. Producer/Narrator Brian Flemming's voice tells us that Christianity once believed that this was the way the universe functioned. Next Flemming says, ""If Christianity could be wrong about this, could it also be wrong in other areas of life?"" The opening transitions  to what are my favorite scenes, consisting of motion pictures of archival silent & 1950  Bible Stories.

Then the scene changes again to a message board image with dozens of pictures of Jesus covering it. Then, one be one, a picture is replaced by an actual person being interviewed regarding their Christian faith. The people represent many races, many different walks of life. They look like anybody you might meet walking down a pleasant street or living next door--and this is what makes their delusional thinking really chilling. They are like pod people.

The film continues to intersperse archival & humorous scenes with interviews of believers & non-believers. One segment that I really related to was on the subject of ""The Rapture."" For those who have been spared knowing what that is, it refers to the ""End of Times"" when ""real"" Christians (i.e. Fundamentalists) will be ""assumptioned"" or fly bodily up into heaven like The Virgin Mary. Then while they (the ""Saved"") watch from their lofty location with Jehovah et al., everybody left on earth will be tortured & cast into hell by the Anti-Christ right before their eyes. The blueprint  for this universal massacre is found in ""Revelations."" I say I related to this because our site  features a historical materialist interpretation of the Armageddon motif by Friedrich Engles: 666 and Historic Materialism.  In it, the earliest of Marxists expresses his astonishment at the sheer delight the author of Revelations takes in anticipating the approaching suffering of all non-believers.

Moving along, there is an interview with a Fundamentalist (I call them the Religious Mafia) who started a website called ""The Rapture Letters."" No kidding. It provides a program for fellow believers who want to leave a message for their unbelieving relatives & friends who get left out of the fast lane to Jehovah.  It's like saying, ""Nani-nani-nah-nah, we made it & you didn't--TOLD YOU SO!"" It's ludicrous--but don't forget, these Fundamentalists occupy positions of authority on all levels of society. I saw an interview on TV with a real life police detective who had absolutely no compunction saying that all ""the bad guys"" he fights on the street are, in fact, demons! And he meant that literally.

He's not the only religiously challenged cop out there in ""The Force,"" I'm sure

When Christians in the movie are asked how they can reconcile ideas in the Bible that don't fit in with the image of the loving Father in Heaven, their invariable response is 1. Outright denial or ignorance of the issues involved, or 2. ""It's all part of God's Will.""

This is like the Salem Witchcraft trials (and, no, I don't believe there were any ""real"" witches.) When asked for proof of a defendants guilt, the accusers offered ""spectral evidence,"" things that could range from nightmares to an upset stomach. Nothing we would call today ""material evidence.""

Another section I liked in the film is how the idea that Jesus may never have existed is presented. In line with this, there is a funny archival clip depicting the Apostle Saul's conversion to Paul, and becoming the great propagandist for the successful Romanized version of Christianity. I found it really interesting when the narrator stated that Paul never demonstrated any knowledge of the Gospels of Mathew, Mark, Luke & John.

THE GOD WHO WASN'T THERE includes a fairly extensive clip from Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF CHRIST. The idea was to show just how meticulous Gibson was in showing graphic, bloody violence. This was important because the motif of blood sacrifice is absolutely central to the confessional/Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam.) The film also made a point first documented by Eisenman, that is, the depiction of the Sanhedrin (Jewish Council that condemned Jesus) as the  embodiment of pure evil. Interestingly, both Eisenman & GOD, etc producer Brian Flemming indicate how ridiculous it was to state, as the Bible does, that the Sanhedrin would have become involved  in such a complex case during Passover. Eisenman goes further & says that they couldn't unanimously agree about anything. Anyone with a background in city government can appreciate the humor. [Above left, The Sanhedrin, from an 1883 encyclopedia]

I'm not going to comment any further on Gibson's abomination because, like a violent rape, it makes me sick to think about.

The film draws a valid analogy between the evolution of the Christian ""Party Line"" and how a hoax story on the internet morphs into a story considered as fact.  Don't forget, they can justify anything because ""God wills it."" Book Burning. Murder. Pogroms. Homophobia. Discrimination. Segregation. Genocide...the Religious Mafia has its pudgy little fingers into everything that doesn't fit in their single dimensional, distorted worldview.

There's only 2 problems I had with the film.

1. The advance promo material overstates its ""dazzling motion graphics."" They're OK, but there are plenty of ""ancient history"" type productions--including several brilliant programs dealing with the Gnostics & Knights Templar (see review below.) Again, the producer's enthusiasm aside, the ideas presented in the film are not particularly new, they've been bouncing around in the public domain for quite some time now.

2. The core dramatic/animated segment ended too soon. I would easily have watched another 30 minutes or so--but then it's good to leave the audience asking for more--and I sincerely hope we see more of related subject matter in future DVDs.",1246579200,5,6542,5.2206303724928365

2454777,2,B000CAPZBC,I was looking forward to seeing this film but found it a big let down.  Not because of the subject matter but it is so poorly done.  The historical elements should have more thoroughly dealt with.  The interviews with the believers don't serve much purpose since we know how little people really think when it comes to religeous matters.  The interviews with the academics was more interesting and proved to be of value.  Also of value were the excerpts from Mel Gibson' film about Christ.  It showed what a sadistic piece of garbage it is!  Had Jesus been subjected to the beatings that Gibson shows he would never have made it to the cross alive.  There is no justification in the Bible itself for the extent of the violence shown.  Clearly Gibson set out to make as exploitative film as he possibly could. I'm ashamed that so many Americans were hooked into supporting Gibson's film.  One final note...the background music is atrocious and almost drowns out the speakers.  The film would have been better without it.,1245110400,,1019,4.732954545454546
2454778,1,B000CAPZBC,"Let me clarify: before you judge my 1 star review thinking that I am an angry and offended Christian, I am not.

From the title I was expecting this documentary to be more scholarly. However the only good part was in the beginning when the author was describing how there was a gap in the time when Jesus was supposedly  alive and when the books about him were written. Rest of the documentary was more like a commentary from Fleming about his feelings towards Christianity. His main thesis is that Jesus was a fictional hero just like the Apollo and the Hercules but his mythical status was transformed into real by hearsay. Half way into the documentary, he starts his criticism of Christians' obsession with bloody sacrifices (which sounds more like an ad hominem argument). There is a long segment dissecting the bloody parts from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B00028HBKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ (Full Screen Edition)</a>"", which feels disconnected with his main thesis.  Then the worst part starts which is his past at Valley Christian Schools where he was taught as a boy that doubting the Holy Spirit will mean eternal condemnation. We can sympathize with him for that but it doesn't really help him prove his thesis. It seems like the documentary starts off well but runs off into random tangents. While it might make some angry atheist very happy because Fleming picks on Christians (and they don't even seem to know what Flemming's real intentions are), but for someone looking for scholarly arguments this film is waste of time, except the beginning. In the end I want to say that I have seen some youtube videos that are better than this.

However, I have to say, I am a great deal dissapointed with this documentary.

While expecting the filmmaking and scholarship of History Channel documentaries about the bible and christian history, I found that TGWWT to be lacking.  While director Brian Flemming touches on several good points, he doesn't spend nearly enough time building the case for these points.

I also found Flemming's interviews to be horrible.  While he has a few good secular speakers, not a single one of his christian interviews was with anyone worth listening to.  Most are pretty embarrassing to listen to.  I would have loved to have heard from some biblical scholars, but unfortunately the most authoratative christian interview in the entire documentary is Fleming's former high-school principal- once he comes on screen the film quickly degrades into being about the director and his own vendetta against the religion that was forced upon him in childhood.

While I sympathise with Fleming, and agree with his points, I do not feel any further enlightened on the topic of the origin of Christianity.",1243036800,6,1208,5.153846153846154

Flemmings from the start pits a bunch of sweet, not so intelligent, unknowing fund-Christians against some tough-edge scholars.  It's like watching a chicken eat a worm.

Even so the holes in his argument as so big, I began to lose interest in even attempting to rebuke his ideas.

Anyone who has sat through a collegiate level Bible course can quickly disassemble his arguments, note his misuse of scripture, and quite nearly laugh at the length he took to portray Christians as complete lunatics.
This film is so easy to rebuke, I can't see any reason in even trying to do so.  It practically proves itself wrong.

2454790,2,B000CAPZBC,"""The God Who Wasn't There"" is not quite in the same league as Michael Moore's similar offerings, such as ""Bowling for Columbine"" or ""Sicko"". At 62 minutes running time, it felt like one-half of a documentary film that wasn't nearly finished. The film does not have the ample length to explore the subject that it sets out to uncover. I am not complaining about the subject matter per se, which is I think one that needs great delving into from all sides, and I applaud Flemming for tackling this most contoversial of subjects. And I will even say that I am somewhat politically and religiously on Flemming's side. However, the entire experience seemed underdone, rather haphazardly edited, and put together in a way you might expect someone still navigating through a community college film course. Overall, the film comes off as a half-baked realization of its subject that abruptly ends just as it was starting to get interesting with the interview with Ronald Sipus, the principal of Village Christian School in the SF Bay Area. The film's main weakness is that it had problems staying focused on and developing the issues that it sets out to investigate. The film meanders from one interviewee to another, often comparing anti-fundamentalist scholars with dogmatic hardcore religious fanatics.

There were two main issues that Brian Flemming sets out to explore. First: Was there an historical Jesus and why do we think he existed? Second: How are leaders of fundamentalist Christian communities teaching young Christians and/or potential converts about who Jesus was? Are they really teaching about Jesus from an historical perspective based on scholarship or simply regurgitating dogma set forth by church fathers who formulated an interpretation about Jesus' life from between the middle of the first century until the fifth century? First off, Flemming spends about 6 to 10 minutes going through the precepts of the Christian doctrine and the traditional view of Jesus' life, which unless you have been living under a rock, is quite well-known. When you only have 62 minutes, that's a high percentage of the film. He goes on to interview between real scholars and fundamentalists who, if they were ever locked into a room together, might tear each other to smithereens. He also asks Christians at some retreat about what they know of other mythical beings such as Mithras and Osiris. Did he really think that these people would know that Mithras birthday is also celebrated on Dec 25th? The point is that much religious scholarship has shown Christianity's indebtedness to other popular mythologies like Mithras and Osiris, but that never quite gets satisfactorily developed. He really needed some of the heavy-hitter scholars like John Dominic Crossan and Elaine Pagels.

Probably the strongest moment of the film is his assessment of the modern films about Jesus. This kind of critical analysis worked very well, with thought-provoking comparisons between ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""Passion of the Christ"". I remember the horrific crucifixion scene from ""Jesus of Nazareth"" when it first aired when I was a kid, not knowing what this was really about until I saw it. ""Passion"" makes ""Nazareth"" seem tame by comparison. I wished the rest of the film was as well-done as this segment which in many ways saves the film from being a total disaster.

And then we finally get to the interview with his old nemesis Ronald Sipus. At first Flemming asks good questions to get his interviewee talking, and much of what Sipus says does very well to prove some of the absurdity concerning the philosophy of his Christian schools. In other words, Flemming's innocent questions get right to the meat of Sipus' fundamentalism without it being forced. But then Flemming makes the biggest faux pas of the production: he starts to debate Sipus on-camera, questioning his interviewee's motives. Sipus then shuts down and refuses to continue the interview. Flemming needed to have a session with someone like Llowell Bergman of PBS' Frontline (formerly of CBS' 60 Minutes) or David Frost to learn how to bring out what you want from your interviewee without putting him or her on the defensive. I really wanted to hear more of what Sipus had to say about his philosophy which would speak for itself. Instead, Flemming inadvertently pushes the ball into foul territory which ends the game. And Flemming, I guess because he failed in his interview, decides to end the whole documentary. I would have liked at least some reaction from a scholar about what Sipus said. Overall, a noble effort that does not quite get there. As an undergraduate student project it would get an A. As a professional project, it gets more like a C.",1239235200,8,4744,5.025412960609911
2454791,1,B000CAPZBC,"Well, Brian Flemming spent a little over an hour doing two things: he tried to establish that the Gospel accounts of Jesus are fictional and he then tried to establish that Christians who believe those accounts are stupid.  After interviewing a couple of Christians coming out of a Billy Graham Crusade, he spent most of the rest of the documentary interviewing people who were hostile to the biblical account of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Of the Christian ""experts"" he did interview (I only remember 2), one of them could not be presented as a spokesman for more than a small group of believers with a particular eschatological position.  The other man interviewed was the president of Flemming's childhood Christian school.  According to the man's own words, the interview was done under false pretenses.  The assumption going into the interview was that Flemming wanted to talk about childhood education in general.  Instead, clearly, Flemming wanted to railroad the school president over the specific Christian beliefs taught at the school (which Flemming obviously had a problem with).  It would have been nice to have seen an interview with someone who would be considered a leading intellectual in the evangelical community.  But of course, that might mean Flemming would have to change the title of his movie -- ""The God who is there, but I am intentionally rejecting Him""",1238889600,4,1381,5.057268722466961
2454792,5,B000CAPZBC,"After reading some of the very diverging reviews, I had mixed feelings when watching this movie.

However, after watching it, I can safely say that this counts as one of the best DVDs I have seen in some time.

Of course, the music does have a special style, which not everybody likes, but it is sort of fitting to the presentation method which the author chose.

The research itself is held simple, yet very convincing. The evidence presented is easy, and yet weighs heavy. Also, the movie is kept very short, which doesn't allow much information to be fit in, but this is not really a bad point. It's great to see a movie once in a while which doesn't bombard its viewer with information.

What evidence the author shows when showing how it is quite unlikely that Jesus ever existed, much less the way he is shown in the bible, is quite thought provoking, after all, we are talking here about THE story which holds together the religion with the most participants worldwide. (Over 1 billion, if I am not mistaken).

All Christians base their faith off the bible, which you could think would have to be one hell of a book. However, it does contain a lot of errors (for example the solar system image which is painted in the bible, creation story etc.). Also, acts of incredible cruelty are presented and even advocated by the old testament. Most Christians at this point like to brush off the discussion, saying that ""well, that's the old testament, it was very weird. The new one is what counts!""

If now, as suggested in this movie, the central figure of the new testament is nothing but a myth, then serious doubt should be provoked and maintained to the ""world's most successful religion"".",1238889600,8,1694,4.6112956810631225
2454793,4,B000CAPZBC,"More and more studies like this now shed new light on old beliefs once taken for granted. What we were indoctrinated with at school was false, biased and inaccurate and investigations like this one lay the cards firmly on the table of truth.
Unfounded information (hearsay) means data derived from other people/third-hand sources (as with the Gospels etc) rather than on a genuine witness knowledge basis, is totally unacceptable today.
Law courts do not in general allow hearsay as proof, and nor does sincere contemporary research. Gossip alone provides no proof or good evidence; therefore we must dismiss it or face the music as narrow-minded hypocrites.
No one has the smallest amount of physical evidence to support a historical Jesus figure. This seems to be the central force in such studies as this one. I have also covered a similar thread in my own volume, The New Pagan Handbook.  Come to think of it - perhaps I should be speaking intimately with the makers of `The God Who Wasn't There'.
Jewish scriptural values joined with Pagan myth/tradition of the time give us adequate information about how such a new-fangled religion as Christianity could have been crafted. Numerous Pagan myths cross-pollinate incredibly closely with the alleged Jesus god-man figure. To ignore such immense similarities, due to blind, unquestioning faith alone, is preposterous and rather dangerous in the extreme.  This is how religious fundamentalism grows.
To ignore the mythological beliefs of history in favour of easily dismissed religious propaganda is basically ridiculous.
Resurrection accounts, Crucifixion tales, Virgin Births etc have all been knocking around long before the Jesus Myth was initially invented by those first cultist politicians, who wanted to rewrite ancient mythology.

2454794,5,B000CAPZBC,"A very good starting point for anyone who wants to really know where Christianity really came from.  The authors that are interviewed in the film and as commentary tracks are very good.  (E.G. Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, etc.)  raises valid questions as to whether there ever really was an historical Jesus.  Some of the questions remain unanswered by the Church.

As for those who claim that this ridicules believers I have two responses:

1) It doesn't but what if it did?  You would ridicule someone who told you that the believed that the world was flat or that Apollo drags the sun across the sky every day.  Why is it wrong to ridicule people who believe that there really was a talking snake, that all the species on Earth have existed since the birth of Earth 6,000 years ago despite mountains of geological evidence, and that there is a great celestial invisibly dictator who created the entire universe and all living creatures and yet is deeply concerned about everyone's masturbation habits.

2) As an experiment, repeat what the documentarian did with any group of Christians and you will find the same results.  They are unaware of the origins of their beliefs and usually unaware of 99% of what is in their own scripture.  (As are 99.9% of adherents to any religion.)  For example, when I told religious friends about the unforgivable sin that damns you to Hell forever, even if you later accept Jesus and ask for his forgiveness (Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) my friends said things like ""I doubt that that is true.""  And ""Is that Old Testament?  That sounds like Old Testament.""  (Jesus says it three times, in three different gospels, by the way.)

It is not teasing believers to show their errors.  It is reality.  When you start claiming that people should not be held to account for their own claims, and that claims such as the God hypothesis should not be questioned or tested, we step ever closer to an Orwellian Theocracy.

Why are people who are supposedly so faithful and so near to ""God"" so upset at the slightest inquiry as to the validity of their beliefs?  If anything, it seems to show a decided LACK of faith.",1238371200,7,2148,4.692513368983957

interviews academics who support his position, then interviews average
Christians highlighting their ignorance of Christian history.

Flemming's tone in this ""documentary"" is unambiguously mocking, and he uses the
technique of freezing frame on Christian interviewees after cornering them on a
subject to emphasize their ""craziness/ignorance"". Even the five minutes or so of
actual historical facts are presented with unmistakable sarcasm.

I truly felt bad for the Schoolmaster interviewed toward the end. Flemming
clearly misled him about the nature of the interview, unless his description
beforehand was ""I'm going to harangue you like an ornery teenager"". This faith
versus reason debate is tired and unhelpful. That interview was an embarrassment
to Flemming, in my opinion.

The major flaw (and irony) here is that the bulk of Flemming's argument/tirade
goes from the reasonable and interesting ""Here are objective reasons why Jesus
may not have existed..."" to the sophomoric and irritating ""How do you KNOW
there's a god?"". The only necessary rebuttal to this pseudo-argument is ""How do
you KNOW there ISN'T, smart guy?"".

Flemming's polarizing rant will likely push away its intended
audience--Christians who are on the fence about their faith, and even more so

It's possible to be a devout Christian and admit that there's some myth added to the history. It's also possible to be a thoroughgoing atheist and allow that there was a fellow named Yeheshua or Jesus who preached in Israel about 2000 years ago.

This DVD does a worthwhile job of raising the question, but it doesn't begin to explore the issue in any depth. What we have instead is someone's personal biography of belief. It's a good piece of work in that way, but not so great as an argument about the historicity of Jesus.",1232755200,13,1366,4.691666666666666

More importantly, the interviews that accompany the body of the film are profoundly valuable classroom resources to introduce students to authentic academic discourse as it takes place among lively and fearless scholars. My students do not have an opportunity to experience anything cut of an even remotely similar fiber. A huge majority of lay conversations in this area are dominated or directed by organized religion's right-wing zealots. Even at the local college, instructors are cautioned against subjecting this community's paper-thin sensitivities to intellectual examination. Because students have simply never been exposed to the breadth of intellectual consideration in which religion is couched, this film represents a rich introduction to the complexities and curiosities that drive science, social science, history, and literature.

Beyond that, it is time we wrested the lectern from the bullies in the pulpit. They are tiresome simpletons, broken records, who shamelessly use fear and terror to constrain the parameters of acceptable discourse. This film inspires me to continue to point out the nakedness of the emperor, the heartless rigidity of intolerance, and the need to educate kids on the broadest scale possible.

2454812,1,B000CAPZBC,"I viewed this film for the first time and then marched into a debate setting with a young atheist. This was 2005 at the Oriental Theater in Denver, Colorado.

The film gives no solid arguments for its outrageous claim that Jesus never existed. But the cinematic mood is dramatic, however. A man recounts his loss of faith and his journey to justify atheism. You get talking heads of supposed experts giving factoids with no context or substance. You see ignorant Christians sputtering about, giving the impression that this is the best they can do.

Of course, this is a flaming crock. The scholarly world can marshal dozens of credentialed scholars who think the nonexistence of Jesus is absurd. These include the most liberal scholars, such as Crosson, Borg, and others. Further, one can cite evangelical scholars like Blomberg, NT Wright, Ben Witherington, Bock, and others to the effect that the Gospels are historically trustworthy to the point of Jesus' miracles and resurrection from the dead. There are a number of sources outside of the New Testament that testify to Jesus' existence: Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and so on. See the work of Van Voorst, FF Bruce, and Gary Habermas.

The attempt to link Jesus with mystery religions was discredited about fifty years ago. The mystery religions can later and bear little resemblance to the Gospels. See Ed Komoszewski, et al, Reinventing Jesus and Ron Nash, The Gospel and the Greeks.

It takes you through a quick summary of what so many atheists have known for so long. And it's entertaining to watch.

He also gives a pretty startling summary of Mel Gibson's pet movie about Jesus.

However, like any movie of this length, one can only pack so much information into it. I doubt many Christians will stop believing after watching this movie. Rather, I would hope that this movie will open their eyes to issues they might not be aware of, and they will go searching for more answers. In that regard, the movie should be thought of as a brief introduction to the topics laid out.

2454814,1,B000CAPZBC,"As someone who makes study of religious debate a hobby, I was very interested to see this film. I was hoping to find a well-thought out, well researched Atheist opinion; what I found was a poorly made argument based on loosely stitched together bits of research. Not once was there a serious historical conversation that supported his views, nor was there a serious conversation that opposed his views. The archetypal mythology was ignored, with the exception of a 5-minute overview of the hero archetype.

Furthermore, I felt that the point of this film was to make Atheists seem correct and intelligent while making Christians seem backwards, foolish, and tyrannical. However, what this film actually did was make the director/narrator come across as a bitter, childish man who blames religion for his problems rather than taking responsibility himself.

As other reviews have said, if you are an Atheist, you will be ashamed of this film, and don't bother watching. If you are a Christian seeking to challenge yourself and grow in your faith, you will be greatly disappointed, and don't bother watching.",1228608000,4,1106,5.104972375690608

A fascinating prospect, if explored in greater detail.

However, the latter part of the documentary takes a different approach, simply discussing the many contradictions of modern Christianity. Provocative, perhaps, but nothing really new. One does not logically argue away faith.

The end reveals the personal motives behind the documentary, and makes it almost seem like it was more made for the filmmaker's benefit than ours.

Still, it has a few good parts, and might grant you a couple new talking points if you like to debate from the stance of atheism. Worth a watch, perhaps, but here's hoping there will be more and more detailed films like this in the future.",1226448000,,938,4.886792452830188

2454817,2,B000CAPZBC,"Maybe I should start my review by saying that I am myself an atheist, as readers will wonder on what side of the fence I stand before they decide whether to take me seriously. If you are a Christian, you probably won't like my take on this movie that much. But then I don't think you will like the movie either, and you are probably aware of that.

So I am addressing mainly other atheists -- and what I want to say is that I found the documentary a real disappointment. I bought it mainly because Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins are mentioned in the blurb. What I was expecting to see here is something neither Harris nor Dawkins cover at any great length in their books: a detailed analysis of the historical origins of Christianity. Among the questions I was hoping to see discussed is whether historical opinion is more inclined to believe that there was indeed a popular leader behind the Jesus legend or whether even the common person is taken to be a historical invention. I also hoped to learn something about the role the Roman Empire played in the growth of Christianity. Both are basic questions for any documentary aiming to discuss the beginnings of Christianity.

But the movie doesn't touch on those points. Instead, it points out that the gospels were written by people living after the times when Jesus is supposed to have lived, and that the figure of Jesus inherited traits from other ""savior"" figures in older mythologies. This is all common knowledge among people with any degree of acquaintance with the subject. But Flemming makes such ""revelations"" to the tune of a sensationalist soundtrack and shocking images, clearly expecting his audience to be flabbergasted. Christians will be disgusted. And atheists with a real interest in history will find nothing here that they don't already know.

On a side note, the interview with Dawkins is on the phone.",1223596800,43,1876,4.766153846153846
2454818,3,B000CAPZBC,"As most of the positive reviews of this film have pointed out, there are a lot of good points made, and a wealth of valuable information and insight presented by the filmmaker.  The best parts, in my view, were the direct interviews : Robert Price, Richard Carrier, and especially Sam Harris (Harris' two books are must-reads, by the way).  Their comments were thoughtful, probing and insightful.  Where the film fell short (again, this is my take) is when Brian Flemming (who wrote, directed and narrated this film) opens his mouth.  I don't disagree with his viewpoint necessarily, but he comes across as what could only be described as 'snarky' too much of the time, sometimes descending to a level that were it not for the technical polish of the project would lead me to believe this was some sort of high-school project.  The scene where he finds the chapel at his old religious school open and goes inside with his camera, winding up stepping in front of it to 'deny the holy spirit' on camera had too much of a 'I'm a naughty-boy, nyah nyah nyah' feel to it for me.

Also, in one of the bonus interviews, where Flemming is speaking with Sam Harris on the subject of morality, and how its existence is not dependent on religion as a foundation, Flemming makes a joke about the Swedes (who were brought up by Harris as an example of a country NOT dependent on religion for moral values) being 'sheep-f'ers' (and yes, I GET IT, that he's being sarcastic, supporting Harris' premise that morality does not need religion to exist).  The look that passes across Harris' face, only for a second, shows that he's surprised by this comment, and, I would hazard to guess, perhaps thinks it's more than a little inappropriate or over the line in what should be more of an intellectual discussion.

None of these 'offenses' I've listed affected me because of any religious feelings I harbor -- believe me, there aren't any.  As I said, I believe that the information Flemming is presented is important and needs to be heard / seen by more people.  I just don't think this film is going to change anyone's mind, mainly because the attitude projected is simply too sarcastic.

Needless to say, others have differing opinions, and I don't expect anyone to make up their mind without seeing it.",1223337600,11,2286,4.69

Mr. Flemming talks to many different people and tries to get them to explain why they believe in what religion teaches them, which by their answers help him bring his point forth.  This movie will change the minds of those people that are sitting on the fence of doubt, but will probably be dismissed by the fervent believer for its irreverence.  This is a movie to be collected because it doesn't get stale with time.  I strongly recommend it to those who want to be informed about religion and atheism.",1223337600,5,713,4.672
2454820,3,B000CAPZBC,"The director, Brian Flemming, is a former fundamentalist Christian who apparently has tremendous bitterness towards his previous faith based belief system. The best part of this doc are the interviews with scholars such as folklore expert Alan Dundes and Jesus Seminar member Robert Price. These academics make a convincing case that the life of Jesus, as recorded in the Bible, was based on previous mythological stories, such as those about Zeus and Dionysus, rather than actual historical events. None of this scholarly evidence is particularly new or groundbreaking. But it is still likely to confound and disturb fundamentalist Christians.

Unfortunately, Flemming's film making skills are way below those of such documentary directors as Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock. Fleming's approach lacks humor and he goes off on way too many tangents, such as his ""hatchet job"" interview with his former Christian school principal, that tend to detract from the strong central thesis that the life of Jesus is based on mythological sources.

As an atheist I am definitely sympathetic to this film's point of view. But I wish the director had done a better job in presenting it.",1223251200,7,1177,5.25531914893617
2454821,1,B000CAPZBC,"The search of the Historical Jesus is something that tends to dominate modern studies of the New Testament.  There are some that believe that somewhere in the Gospels is the real Jesus.  The only thing that is keeping us from seeing him is all of those imaginary stories like the virgin birth and being raised from the dead.  After all, we know scientifically that people cannot do such silly things.  By peeling back these mythic layers, one can find the Jesus of history and discover his secret message that has been buried all these years.

Don't get me wrong.  I love history.  I have loved history since my Dad took me to see the Magna Carta when I was in the 8th grade.  My games of Trivia Pursuit basically consist of me racing from one yellow space to another.

History is important for studying the Gospels.  It gives us insight into the context and culture that our Lord was born into.  Serious Biblical scholarship demands a careful study of history.

Brian Flemming's film The God Who Wasn't There begins with the premise that Christianity is wrong.  He asserts that when you peel away all of those mythic layers surrounding Jesus, nothing is left.  This of course is a challenge not only to orthodox Christianity, but even to those who want to search for merely a historical Jesus.

Flemming begins his thesis by showing that the letters of St. Paul pre-date the writing of the Gospels.  Most scholars would agree with this.  He goes on to say that St. Paul did not believe that Jesus was a real person, but rather some mythic figure.  The Gospels would then come along later to expand the myth.  Most scholars would disagree with this.

Did St. Paul believe Jesus was a real person in human history or did he believe that he was writing an eloquent allegory to show humanity how to live the good life?

Let's review the facts.

-St. Paul was writing his letters to already established local Churches, some of which he did not establish himself.  This means that others were spreading the Gospel.

-St. Paul himself acknowledges that there were others spreading the Gospel.  (Col 1:5-7)

-St. Paul writes about his persecuting the early Church (Gal 1:13)

-St. Paul writes about the human nature of Christ being born (Romans 1:3)

-Although St. Paul didn't know Jesus before the ascension, he acknowledged that others did. (2 Cor 5:16)

-St. Paul does write about events that happened before the crucifixion (1 Cor 11:24)

Let's not forget that St. Paul died because of his faith in Jesus Christ.  Even a cursory reading of his letters reveals that St. Paul did believe that Jesus was real and that he encountered many others that believed the same thing.

In this ""information age"" it's easy to forget that Christianity was born into a culture that transmitted information orally.  Just because the Gospels weren't written until years after Jesus' resurrection, doesn't mean that people weren't talking about the events in Jesus' life.  After all, St. Paul was writing his letters to someone right?  The Gospel spread orally before St. Paul wrote his first letter.

Flemming then tries to disprove the existence of Christ by demonstrating his similarities to other mythic figures.  I have always loved studying ancient mythology, so I was actually disappointed by the lack of depth on this topic in the film.  Flemming's scholars provide a litany of Christ-like legends, but they never really try to explain their similarities (alien implants?) and make absolutely no attempt whatsoever to discuss their many differences. (Flemming dismisses early Christian apologists' belief that Satan planted mythic forgeries throughout history to make it difficult for pagans to accept Christ.  Which...... kind of sounds like something Satan would do actually.....)

Flemming wants to show that the story of Jesus is simply a retelling of the old pattern of hero myths, with elements that are present in everything from Hercules legends to Superman comics, but only provides enough content for the most disgruntled of viewers to ""connect the dots.""  It gives the feel of style over substance.  Which of course forces the question, is there enough content to begin with?

Instead, Flemming relies on Michael Moore-style ""ambush interviews"" with evangelicals as they arrived for a worship service.  He asks them if they ever heard of Osiris (most haven't) to show that Christians are ignorant of the origins of their faith.  I think the director meant this to be entertaining, but it really doesn't contribute to his theories about Christians.  There are plenty of atheists that are not familiar with the story of Osiris either.

Perhaps the biggest flaw in the film is Flemming's view of Christians in general.  This flaw stems from Flemming's own background as an evangelical Protestant.

For Flemming, the only real Christians are those that adhere to Sola Scriptura.  He shares the evangelical's disdain for ""moderate Christians"" as not taking the Bible (and therefore Jesus) seriously.  He seems to have no idea about the role of Sacred Tradition in Catholicism or the founding of various local Churches by the apostles (those folks St. Paul was writing his letters to.)

This is why I think he so easily ignores the oral transmission of the Gospel and the importance of the early Church councils on orthodox Christology.  For him, if it's not in the Bible, it doesn't count.  Never mind the fact that most Christians are not evangelical Protestants.  He only loosely refers to Catholicism in the film by mentioning the crusades, the place of the sun in the solar system, and the inquisition.  Given his background, it wouldn't surprise me if this was all he ever heard about Catholics while he was growing up.

Flemming uses the film the Passion of the Christ to show that Christians are obsessed with blood, something they inherited from pagan rituals.  He points out that the Passion outsold both Jesus Christ Superstar and The Last Temptation of Christ.  What he doesn't point out is that modern filmgoers, for better or worse, are looking for realism in film and television.  This is evident in everything from the spectacular special effects in Revenge of the Sith to the success of shows like Survivor.  He also fails to point out that the Passion appealed to conservative Christians who were tired of films like Temptation, and the likelihood that a more traditional film would have made a lot of money no matter how much or little blood appeared on the screen.

Flemming also tries to drive home the point that the Judeo-Christian religions are harmful to the human race.  He forgets about the 20th century conflicts waged by regimes that rejected religion.  Could you imagine what would happen to our society if all the Catholic hospitals, schools, and charities disappeared?  I am confident that Christians provided more relief to Hurricane Katrina victims than all other groups, including atheists, combined.  Have there been times when Christians failed to act with charity?  Sure.  But the light always outshines the darkness.  (It just doesn't make the news as often.)

Viewers of the film will immediately realize that the commentators featured in the film represent only one opinion and other opinions (from Christian historians and Scripture scholars) are not included.  I don't count the principal of Flemming's grade school alma mater, the [...] webmaster or the parking lot evangelicals.

The film itself is pretty fast paced although the use of older (public domain) films loses its novelty almost immediately.  The soundtrack, featuring clips of praise and worship songs, is an interesting selection but their volume drowns out Flemming's narration at times.

As someone who has rejected his evangelical upbringing, Flemming presents nothing less than a flawed assault on Christianity.  Some of Flemming's challenges to Christianity are old, ancient really.  It does drive home a point that quests for merely a historical Jesus will always come up short.  The Christian faith is a living faith informed by history (Jesus is the Lord of human history) and guided by the Holy Spirit.  How many councils were convened to settle the question of Dionysus' divinity?  How many people worship at temples dedicated to Mithras?  Flemming does not try to explain why Christianity still thrives.  I don't think he would like the answer.

Was there a historical Jesus Christ?  Yes.  He is the one Lord, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father.  Through him all things were made.  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man.  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered, died, and was buried.  On the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.",1222819200,16,9077,4.933333333333334

This film is an exercise in rhetorical stupidity, as Flemming evidently has less respect for his audience than he does for Christians. If Flemming were to do actual research for a Christ-bashing film, then perhaps it would be worthwhile. But he is too afraid to interview knowledgeable Christians who'd be able to answer him. He is fearful of exploring his own background, and finding out if he truly professed faith in Christ as a child, and exploring what Christianity is all about. Instead, he imbibes deeply at the well of critical, skeptical biblical scholarship, and seem to do little thinking for himself, and becomes angrier and angrier, and less and less coherent and rational in his views, much less his expression of them.",1222473600,6,931,4.788819875776397
2454823,2,B000CAPZBC,"All in all, I'd recommend this DVD for its provocative nature, and many good points, but calling it a documentary is tough. It's far more like the agitprop of Michael Moore. Not that that's bad, for he is a very good crafter of filmic art, as long as you realize his work, and this film, is agitprop with no attempt at objectivity, and that agitprop is designed, at its core, to appeal to the heart, not the head. That said, it is, with only a couple of minor Biblical textual exceptions, good history, but only meager agitprop- Flemming has neither Moore's skill with film and its presentation, nor his humor, but there are glimmers that he could get better, and a return trip to this material when he has improved would be welcome. Hopefully, there will be other documentary filmmakers who will tackle some of this film's many questions, for, far too often, Flemming sounds like he's still trying to convince himself of the fact God does not exist, yet, if he were truly irreligious he'd not really care. With more balance, rather than using only the two morons who provide the pro-Jesus point of view, the digs against the manifest stupidity of the Jesus claims would stand out all the more plainly, and Flemming would not come off as such a bully, picking on the mentally deficient, or seeming as an ex-alcoholic ready to torch a bar in a Carry Nation crusade, as too often the converts from any system of belief to another are the worst sorts of supporters for the new belief system.
  As the old apothegm says, if a glass of water is clear that fact will be readily apparent by merely holding it up to the light. To quote yet another apothegm, in ending, a little more light and a little less heat would have been welcome, as well as better art and dialectic. For better or worse, the strength and honesty of dialectic all too often determines the outcome of the minds who listen, and this film's strength and honesty could and should be higher, closer to its art. Such unity of purpose and presentation is what all good critics should strive to seek. Few do, and as a consequence the art, the artist, and the art lovers suffer. Thus, I urge Flemming to seek to get better, for voices as his are needed- they just need to be as clear as they are strong.",1221782400,3,2259,4.4939172749391725

It then spends too much time making unauthorized use of ""The Passion of the Christ"" to demonstrate the violence and blood lust of Christianity, and then ends with an ambush interview of the principal of the school the director attended as a child.

In terms of the choice of interviewees, none is particularly high-caliber. Including footage of more eminent scholars -- such as leading historians who could talk about the appearance or non-existence of Jesus Christ in secular historical accounts of the time, and leading rational atheists such as Christopher Hitchens or Richard Dawkins (who, in fairness, offers an optional audio commentary) -- would have been more convincing and effective.

2454846,2,B000CAPZBC,"Let me start by saying this I was raised a Christian, including sunday masses and bible school from the time I was a child until the time I was confirmed around 15 or 16. I was once a very big Christian however fell out of favor with Christ and his teachings for my own personal reasons. I am now secular and I have done reasearch upon the most popular religions of the world today to better understand all of them. I heard of this video and gave it a shot hoping it would put any remaining belief in Christ and his teachings to rest however they did not. They left me here at the same square I was at before. Let me begin by explaining that if you know nothing of Christianity then you may at first be taken in by this video but because I know a lot of the gospels I know better. The video really distorts some of the facts and it raises good questions but however based on incorrect statments. The scriptures are actually misquoted multiple times, when its convienient for them they count non cannon biblical texts as cannon and when its convienient for them they count non cannon's as non cannon's and so on. Id like to say that as a non believer today this video put my final thoughts to rest however it did not in any way. I was actually unable to watch the entire video because of the misleading statements he made. If someone can comeout and denounce the God I once believed in very much with actual facts and good quetions and answers I'll be willing to listen and take up the torch. Untill then I'll be on my own Island denying the existence of God and Christ with my only weapon ""I don't know, you must decide for yourself"" one thing is for certain though. This video sucks, it does bring up good points but many of its major focal points are farses and extreme ones too. They claim that Christianity stole from a pagan religion however that pagan religion was created during the first century and did not become big untill the fourth century, things of this nature. he says that Paul says in his writings that Jesus would not be a priest in this world if he came here, it does not say that at all but that Jesus would not be a priest as they know it because he was of greater being, that same kind of argument were they say he's the King of Kings and then someone asks ""where's his crown"" same thing except replace king with Priest and crown with cassock (Clerical dress worn by Christian Priests). Overall not well done and supprisng coming from the maker of the video, looks as though either he was looking to turn a profit, or he has bad facts himself or he misleads when he has to and when its convienient too so that his story for how things should go or did not go for that matter won't have loop holes because then people would bash him for that and say that too much is left open which is kind of going to happen anyways because one thing about religion is this you can put everbodys views on any religion into one of two main catagories, ""Yes it did happen"" and ""No it didnt"".

2454854,4,B000CAPZBC,"This is a must see film for those of us who grew up with the cross burned into our young impressionable psyches, but inevitably ended up with having free thought once we started reading books and researching facts. The director of this film, an ex-Christian with a passion for exposing the faults and fallacies of the Holy Bible, presents us with a fairly decent documented historical look at the origins of the Bible and many similar Christ-like historical figures. It's the version Christians don't want you to see.

He brings up a few good points. Half of all people in America today believe they will live during the end times. It's funny how all Christians have thought that since the birth of Christianity. All the more reason to believe so now? That's why America is afraid of progress and not worried about the future. Who cares about the environment, loss of resources or over population? We'll be dead soon anyway. Right? Most of the world is not Christian, which means that most of all people who ever lived, are and will be, in Hell, for all eternity. Why does god care about indigenous peoples too? Without Christ you are nothing but an evil being waiting your turn for eternal damnation.

At one point during the film, a few Christians were interviewed and questioned about their faith. They used the usual verbatim answers you hear from most Christians. They were then asked their opinions on Christ-like gods such as Horus and Mithra. Of course, they had no idea who they were. One woman replied, ""I don't believe in pagan gods."" The subjects were merely questioned, they were not as badgered as other anti-Christian documentaries.

Most Christians know very little about the book they praise and the history of their own belief system. Few Christians have even read the entire Bible. Many people are even scared to question their faith, thanks to a god fearing society. People somehow think the Bible was divinely inspired. I fail to see how it differs from previous philosophies and belief systems or any ideas man has come up on his own. Fear of god is more powerful than fear of ignorance. I would definitely fear a god who thought the Earth was the center of the universe, dinosaurs co-existed with man, thought the universe was 10,000 years old, and would send me to hell for having free thought too.

However, I personally didn't learn very much more than I already knew. He didn't cover anything about king Cyrus and Zoroastrianism, and he didn't talk at all about Martin Luther, which are two of the most important figures in the history of Christianity. This film probably wouldn't appeal to well researched individuals. Nevertheless, it is perfect for those who are losing their faith and looking for a different history of the Bible, which is the version Christians either deny or have no desire to learn themselves. I think Christians who are willing to test their faith should see this film.

The problem with this film is that the director is overwhelmingly convinced there never was a Jesus. It is quite bold for anyone to state there definitely was or wasn't a Jesus, especially with the lack of evidence to support either claim. Suppose there was. He was more than likely not the ""god"" or ""magician"" he was said to be. It could also be likely he never existed. If you think Zeus or Poseidon never existed, isn't it just as plausible that Jesus never did either? The important question really should be...Is Christianity right or wrong?

Besides the bad music choices, silly computer graphics, short duration, and regular atheist banter(which wasn't too overkill), this was an entertaining film.

The only way the ""no Jesus/no God"" theses can be sustained nowadays is to simply refuse to even look at the relevant evidence.

The members of the self-styled ""Jesus Seminar"", for example, STARTED their investigations by assuming that Jesus Christ was ONLY an ordinary man albeit with a good line in pithy sayings (i.e. couldn't do miracles, couldn't predict the future, including his own death, etc.) and THEN based their ""conclusions"" on the little that was left of the four Gospels.  And guess what, they found that Jesus was just an ordinary man, albeit with a good line in pithy sayings!

JS member Robert Price, who is also into H.P. Lovecraft and writes stories in that genre, goes even further.  He STARTS by assuming that Jesus Christ never existed, and THEN ignores any evidence that contradicts his viewpoint.  And guess what, he finds that Jesus Christ never existed!

This is not just preaching to the converted.  It's an intellectual vacuum.  If the case against Christianity is really so strong, why does anyone need to resort to this kind of subterfuge to make their case?

I'm a Roman Catholic theologian, a Christian believer, and one who believes wholeheartendly in the value of authentic dialogue.  We Christians can no more prove our belief than our atheist neighbors and friends can disprove it.  Rather than attempting to ""convert"" others to our way of thinking or believing, it seems much more helpful for the life of the planet that we grow to authentically understand one another in all our similarities and differences.

I have no religious axe to grind, and I must confess that I was looking forward to seeing this DVD.  By understanding the limits of our own positions we are able to grow as persons and my expectation was that this documentary would demonstrate the limits to the historical evidence for the ""Jesus event.""

Alas, I was profoundly disappointed and was unable to finish the DVD because I found its tone to be flippant and derisive.  Authentic dialogue, whether it's accomplished face to face or through media, cannot work if either party is unwilling to respect the other.  Rather than offering a solid and fact-based, critical appraisal of the Christian understanding of history, I found the narrator to be dismissive in attitude from the very beginning of the presentation.  It's a pity, really.  I cannot condone it any more than I can condone the dismissive believer who is disrespectful to the agnostic or atheist.

Religious believers should never fear the truth, even when its historical evidence points in a direction that seems to disprove faith.

2.)The viewpoint of Jesus Christ has been so twisted and warped,that they only focus on a ""judgemental"" or ""punishing"" God rather than a forgiving,merciful and loving God. There are very few things in this world,if any at all,that will give you the same unconditonal love as Jesus Christ. But this movie chooses to obliterate that.

3.)These people have decided that the only things that matter are the shallow,superficial,materialistic ways of this world. Just think;would you rather live your life by a rule of:

It all depends on how much money you make,how many lovers you've had,how beautiful you are,how much power you have etc.

OR would you rather live your life on the basis of the beauty of a peron's heart and soul,forgiving one another,loving your fellow man and perhaps most importantly that one day all of our burdens,all of our strife and all of the injustice and corruption of the world will cease to be?

Is the choice really that difficult to make?

Believe in nothing and spend the majority of your life terrified of death,or believe in a compassionate loving God who is patient, understanding and welcomes us all to true peace and happiness.

I have already made my choice and I am far more content and at ease than the majority of this fast paced,ever arguing,reality tv based,celebrity worshipping world.

2454860,2,B000CAPZBC,"I will start with the positives first.  I found that the makers of this documentary made some interesting and valid claims, especially about the lack of historical evidence about how early Christianity spread and about Jesus' life.  I liked their comparison of non-Christian religious figures to Jesus (the plethora of virgin births, miracles, etc) to show that the miracles surrounding the story of Jesus are not unique to Christianity.  They effectively showed how people blind themselves willingly by accepting things on faith instead of basing conclusions on logical, empirical evidence (the bit about the burden of proof resting not with non-religious people but with the religious was very good).  They also painted a brief, yet effective picture of the moral bankruptcy of many of the leading figures of the fundamentalist Christian movement in America over the past few decades.

What I did not like, however, was that the creators of this film had a tendency to ""quote mine,"" and took a few biblical passages out of context (one example is their misrepresentation of Luke 19:27).  Doing something like that only undermines their credibility.  There are plenty of vengeful passages about the massacring of entire peoples, and of children.  There really is no need to take something out of context, thus appearing untruthful.  (In fact, quote mining is a favorite tactic of religious fundamentalists when they attempt to refute evolution.)  Regardless of who employs it, quote mining is a detestable practice, and it is intellectually dishonest.

As for the style of the film, I also found that it was rather patchy and did not flow quite as well as other documentaries in this same genre.  It does not feel cohesive, and the ending was actually rather abrupt.  I think the film jumped around and tried to cover too much material.  Had the film makers chosen a more narrow focus, allowing them to delve deeper into one or a few aspects, perhaps this movie would have been more effective.  But because of their broad focus, they ended up omitting some really important topics.  I also feel they should have explained just how many times the Bible has been translated, and that the original documents no longer exist.  They could have gone into more detail about the selection of the documents that eventually came to make up today's Bible, and about how errors in translation have affected religious practice.

Most importantly, this film does not refute ignorant ideas that many religious people hold that atheists are somehow immoral and unappreciative of life (statistically, most crimes are committed in America by religious people; if you control for the relative numbers of atheists and theists, the numbers become more damning).  They could have shown that morality is not derived from religion (other primates show significant evidence of having morality as well).  They should have explained, or at least mentioned, that people who understand they only have one life tend to cherish it.  Thinking about all the events that occured in a specific way that allowed our presence on Earth is truly mindblowing. Life is beautiful, and we need to live in harmony and productively, because we only get one crack at it.

As it stands, I feel ""The God Who Wasn't There"" is good for shock value, but not for much else.  It comes across as an erratic rant.  For more substantial films about the dangers of extreme religion, I would suggest watching something like ""The Root of All Evil"" (I believe you can watch this free of charge on Google Video).

2454862,2,B000CAPZBC,"As a documentary, this film isn't very well put together. It drifts here and there, and doesn't really have a focus. Sure, he lays out the evidence that raises doubts about the validity of scripture, but does it in an inconsistent and sometimes bewildering way, making it hard to follow at times. For example, it takes about two-thirds of the way through the film until Flemming reveals that he used to be a evangelical.

Now, just to go on record, I am an athiest too and quite a staunch one, and I am not panning this movie because of its content. I think there should be many more documentaries critical of religion (and Christianity in particular), but this one fails to impress.",1193875200,4,683,4.598360655737705

Little is new here except some of the goofy assertions that are just not right, such as mistaking the meaning of Jesus' saying that He'd raise the temple three days after it was destroyed.  Jesus was referring His body as the temple of God's presence, and the biblical text makes that clear, but the filmmaker misrepresents Him as referring to the Second Temple, which was obviously not raised again three days after its destruction in AD 70.  This was supposed to show how wrong Jesus was.  Didn't the filmmaker have any friends to clue him in on this and other easily discredited claims he makes?

It's perplexing to see unbelievers tear straw men to pieces and think they've accomplished something.  I'm glad I got this out of the library rather than paying for it: it wasn't challenging enough to watch more than once.

2454866,3,B000CAPZBC,"Frankly, I feel like people are trying to jump on the bandwagon with this film. Definitely, Flemming tries hard, and he presents some very good points, but I have a few problems with how he tries to establish them.

For instance, Flemming says that ""Paul wrote lots of letters about Christianity. In fact, he wrote eighty thousand words about the Christian religion. These documents represent almost all we have of the history of Christianity during this decades-long gap. And here's the interesting thing. If Jesus was a human who had recently lived, nobody told Paul"". Think of it this way, in the Book of Acts, Luke (who is VERY precise about historic details) does not mention the Romans destroying the Temple in AD 70. I may be stretching it here, but 100% of the time archaeological evidence could prove or disprove the writings of Luke, the prove them. If Luke did not mention such a great event, it would be more logical if those new testament books were written well before AD 70, when Flemming places them. If the books were written in closer proximity to Christ's lifetime, then Paul would not have to mention those events in his writing, as they would be common sense items that would not have to be displayed. Remember, Paul did not write his letters to convince 21st century athiests.

""Paul doesn't believe that Jesus was ever a human being. He's not even aware of the idea."" Au contraire, may I direct you to 1 Timothy 6:13,""I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate"", it is my firm belief, as it should be the belief of all outside of insane wards, that fictional characters do not address actual people, let alone confess before them. It is utterly preposterous and a slight against reason to say that Paul did not believe Christ Jesus to be a living, breathing, being. I do not think I can state it any more bluntly than this, people will not be martyred over fairy tales.

I really would have much more respect for this film and its makers if they had consulted with decent intellectual Christians who have a vague idea on how to form an argument for their religion. Christianity is not meant to be followed blindly, but one may very well think that when the primary Christian source that the film makers interview is a, let me put this nicely, chauvinist idiot. Plenty of people follow Christianity because their parents told them to, or because they had friends who did. Plenty of people have gone into war with Christianity as their battle slogan. Does that make war right? No. Does it make Christianity wrong? No. People can easily get the wrong message or the wrong idea out of something. I refuse to believe that someone's ignorance of the cultural significance of Osiris and Dionysus refutes their religion. I do not have any degrees, I am still in high school, I am willing to think, yet I am not going to be walked on.

Really though, this film is preaching to the choir. I sincerely doubt that  Rev. Jed P. Ledbedder is fumbling for his credit card in order to purchase this documentary. The least I can say to everyone who is undecided about religion is this, do not let your religion be swayed by a two hour documentary or the frustrated rantings of an eighteen year old. Look at everything, weigh your choices, make good decisions. Remember, this is your soul we are talking about. Good Luck.",1188086400,8,3427,4.6392092257001645
2454867,3,B000CAPZBC,"Brian Flemming is an ex-evangelical. His theology is thus based on post-reformation interpretations of Christianity. This documentary may sway evangelicals or give atheists an angle on something new (mythology) but Catholic apologetics will counter it. Horrifically Brian Flemming has undergone something that the Catholic Church stays well clear from since Vatican II (see aggiornamento). That is to stay away from the focus on salvation through fear (imperfect contrition). The Catholic Church understands that this is theology in the wrong direction. Christianity without love is considered heretical anyway. It appears that Brian has gone through the darker side of Christianity (if it can be called Christianity). In many ways Brian is interpreting the Bible for himself. This is pretty much the standard evangelical stance but Catholic policy has always maintained that guidance is important. Brian's case is a good example of why that guidance cannot be underestimated.

`The God who wasn't there' (TGWWT) starts by saying that Christianity was wrong when the Church did not approve heliocentricity forwarded by scientists (some of whom where also clergy). This is true and culminated in the Galileo affair but a complete understanding of this part of the historical record shows that there where many problems on both sides. The Church relied on arguments styled on biblical interpretations that Saint Augustine warned against (using direct literal interpretations rather than understanding their historical context [see Dei Verbum for the St. Augustine ref. in section 12]). The Pope believed that Galileo (his childhood friend) had insulted him publicly (which was a criminal offense at that time) in one of Galileo's works.

TGWWT then introduces us to happy Christians but also Christians who did bad things or are hoping for an apocalypse. We get a short movie about the life of Christ edited into a montage from various films about Jesus. The documentary filmmaker, Brian Flemming then interviews a woman taking care of her baby to explain the history of Christianity to him. When she limits her response to the day of Pentecost Brian Flemming complains about how inadequate her knowledge is. I would personally like to see him try that one on with a Bishop instead of a mother taking care of her infant. He then questions other evangelicals on the history of the Church. This is actually a sore spot for evangelicals because they want to avoid mentioning Catholicism. Catholicism would have given better answers in that Jesus started a Church with apostolically succeeded Bishops who can trace their Church history back to Christ as a matter of the historical record. That would have given Flemming more meat to chew on than homing in on a busy evangelical mom. However Brian Flemming was probably brought up to reject the Catholic Church so maybe we can't blame him for not seeing that angle.

Flemming then starts a timeline. He says that the Gospels came after Christ (who was crucified in 33 AD) and says that the other three are derived from Mark (known as Markan priority). He claims that since Mark talked about the destruction of the temple that the Gospels must occur after 70 AD. This might not be the case if we take it that the writing is prophetical (it could have prophesized the destruction before). Since this is more about historical criticism rather than supernatural possibilities historians go for the plus 70 AD date but it need not be. There are many early Christian writings not in the Bible (such as the Didache). Really a person needs to sit down and learn the history of the Bible here and the history of the early Church including the Judaism that came before it!

Brian Flemming then asserts that Saul (St. Paul) was responsible for the gap between 33 AD and 70 AD based only on a post-resurrection experience of the risen Christ and that he did not know anything about Christ's actual life. However Paul meets the apostles in Acts 9:26 at the Council of Jerusalem. You can read about that Council elsewhere. Flemming then quotes Heb 8:4 to say that Paul believed that the death burial and resurrection of Christ was mythical. The Heb 8:4 says ""If Jesus had been on Earth"". Better translations read ""Now if he were on Earth"" (in relation to Jesus staying on Earth as opposed to going to heaven in this context). So Brian Flemming is probably victim to a bad translation but this is more like verse mining to push a point. Brian Flemming then claims that Paul is not even aware that Jesus was human. Paul calls Jesus a man in Rom 5:15, 5:17, 1Ti 2:5 for examples. The Council of Jerusalem pretty much shows that the Church was active during this timeframe where Brian Flemming says everyone forgot. The big problem here is that the history is with the Catholic Church, not with evangelical movements who don't want to talk about that Church which they historically parted with.

Brian Flemming then goes for folklore professors (who thinks the apocryphal stories are rejected because of mysticism when in fact it was the Church that pronounced which books where to be accepted and rejected (see Council of Carthage III). Modernism is actually a 20th century phenomena and not an early Church position. See Modernism (Roman Catholicism). Read Lamentabili Sane. However the actual historical evidence for Jesus, whatever criteria is used, should be applied to all historical figures at that time. That is important. This area of research can be fun for everybody. There is lots more than just what Brian Flemming presents so the viewer doesn't really get a complete case history here.

Robert M. Price has some interesting comments which should be verified by any serious researcher. The hero pattern myth theory is well presented as are the arguments of Price. These arguments can also be found in the controversial findings of the popular `Jesus seminar' and have a lot to do with early apologetics. It is called the Mythographic perspective of Jesus and is used by Brian Flemming to conclude that Jesus is mythological. This section of TGWWT is about Saint Justin Matyr who argued that devils where responsible for creating the pagan heros who are similar in person or deeds to Jesus is a whole topic that requires an apologists full attention and you need to check sources and date them. Saint Justin Matyr was actually a pagan convert who understood pagan mythology. Saint Justine claimed that pagans had gotten some of their ideas from earlier Jewish scriptures (believed to have contained the prophecies of Jesus) and had tried to imitate the actual messiah of the Jews, acts of which St. Justine attributes to the devil. These Greek myths may not predate Christ (there sources are post-Christ). Some occurred during Christ. The sources for these greek myths are post-Christian sources although archaeological coverage turns up shrines etc., the stories when dated usually conform to post-Christian events. Read up on Dionysus and Mithras. Study up on this whole topic. There are actually better `Jesus' candidates out there (Zalmoxis for example). The bigger issue here though is the Hellenzation of Judaism and its influence on Christianity. No historian can deny this but saying Christianity took from these legends may be a stretch.

The history of the U.S Christian soldiers gets coverage (essentially fighting for God) and the problem with fundamentalism with respect to extremists groups who ignore the pacifism and non-retaliatory instructions of Christ (say an `Our Father' to find out about non-retaliatory) or read Luk 6:27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,. Brian Flemming uses Lk 19:27 to imply that Jesus asks his followers to kill for him. Luk 19:11-12 shows that Jesus is actually quoting from a parable. Lk 19:27 is popular with anti-Christianity quote mining.

The rapture gets coverage. The rapture argument is post-reformation and is maybe 200 years old at best. It doesn't have a historical usage before that. It is based on Bible misinterpretation along the lines of the alleged `imminent return prophecy that didn't come to pass' conundrum. Sam Harris is quite interesting to listen to when he appears.

While Jesus did imply that denying the Holy Spirit meant that the sin was unforgivable (so Brian Flemming sees only hell as the result of saying or thinking this) Jesus gave his apostles and those who succeeded them (see Act 1:26 for example) the power to forgive any sin in Jn 20:23. The denial of the Holy Spirit verse in Mat 12:31 may actually imply that people who are in the spirit, but do not explicitly acknowledge Jesus, may get into heaven. Seeing Brian say that he denies the Holy Spirit on camera is just silly more than anything. It just goes to show that his version of Christianity is probably one of the most warped ones around. I would agree with him that fundamentalism is out of control (as he plainly demonstrates by his version of Christianity, even if it draws a negative). I think there are many alternatives other than just letting completely go.

I kind of feel sorry that he didn't do some better research but then again film festivals are a great way to make some money and I think his documentary is very good overall for a low-budget film maker. Kudos for that. I hope he makes a career out of making documentaries. Maybe go a little deeper next time?

Oh yeah and that school principle. He isn't a good scientist but maybe he does a good job keeping kids from physical harm. Who knows?",1187481600,12,9536,4.957473420888055

2454869,1,B000CAPZBC,"I would recommend this documentary to people trying to clip the moebius strip of Christianity as quickly as I would suggest that a rabid critique of Cosmo and Maxim would improve society. I actually had high hopes, after hearing a few Dawkins lectures, that this was going to be more substantial.

Christianity is posited as a strawman faith here, focussing on a shard of intepretation that is so compact and narrow that while it does have applications in controverting certain sensationalist tendencies within contemporary Christianity, it shows a surprisingly lackluster knowledge of the Hebrew texts, their innovations on religious cycles, their own struggles with hellenistic culture, the barbarism they faced under Roman rule, and the many other aspects of this area of study that consitute authentic scholarship of the subject.

In short - this film is a hack of the real issues. Pick the easiest most vocal and sensationalized target (overmarketing to boot) and beat it with a stick? That's not scientific. Science involves observation with an open mind - it expects innovation and discovery - this is op-ed posturing as 'study.'

If you want to understand things or teach a person a lesson, you do not go about this way. The film assumes its hypothesis and would appeal strictly to those who already accept it - much like the religious schoolmaster at the end of the film - on a personal sense of affirmation through common consent. How ironic!

In sum, it suggests an interesting corrolary in reverse to a very popular Christian one - while it is often said that atheists make the best Christians, it is often just as true (as in this case) that Christians make the worst atheists - this film is sensational, not intelligent, and opinionated - not informed.",1185148800,16,1766,4.976271186440678

2454874,3,B000CAPZBC,"While I was disappointed with the tone and direction (and especially the ending) of this documentary, there is still some worthwhile material here -- notably the extended, supplemental interviews with Sam Harris, Alan Dundes, Robert M. Price, and the Earl Doherty commentary track.

As many reviewers have already said, the director did indeed come across like an angry young man with an ax to grind, so it was very fitting when Robert M. Price indirectly addressed that very matter. Here's a sample from that interview:

Brian Flemming: Do you think it's possible to be an Atheist and a Christian?

Robert M. Price: Oh, yeah. I kind of think I am one. Because I think it's category confusion to think of God as an external entity like the moon orbiting the earth. There's no God out there in that sense. In Psalm 22 it says that God is enthroned upon the praises of His people. Well I don't know what was in the mind of the writer but I love that phrase, because that is where God is. God is a function of worship and of religious experience. If you can show, as you probably can, that all religious experience comes out of the temporal parietal lobe of the brain, that's fine with me. I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm simply saying there is such a thing as wholesome religious experience that does not beg historical or scientific questions.

BF: So I've asked every Atheist I've interviewed this: Why do you hate Jesus?

RMP: I don't at all, in fact I fear Atheists have a kind of Dracula response. They have a kind of superstitious fear of Jesus [which] strikes me as neurotic and paranoid. What is the problem with Jesus? We're not talking about Hitler. What's the problem with the Bible? There's a lot of barbaric stuff as you would expect in an ancient mythical book, but it's not _Mein Kampf_; it's not _The Satanic Bible_. There's just a kind of superstitious phobia. A lot of Atheists have emerged from a lot of abusive religious experiences, and I'm glad they got out of it, but they now have a kind of over-reaction, it seems to me, like somebody who was in an abusive relationship and will no longer risk having relationships or commitments anymore. You're just cutting off your nose to spite your face.

BF: If you don't have faith in supernatural events and you don't believe, I assume, in an afterlife and heaven and hell and all that, what is religion for?

RMP: It's to enrich this life along the lines Aristotle said drama is, in fact all drama grows out of religion. It's a laboratory in which you create catharsis -- the cleansing of the soul of pity and terror by means of pity and terror, I think was his definition, although not necessarily terror but there is a sense of awe in the spectacle of the myths that are acted out and joined in by way of rituals and sacraments. It is essentially dramatic and aesthetic in nature. But that's not to downplay it. As Tillich said: One shouldn't say it's merely a symbol -- Oh no! no! What do you think a symbol is? Say _no less than_ a symbol! If Jesus did actually rise from the dead and you had it on video tape, what would be the spiritual meaning of that if that is where it ended? Why would that be any different than getting footage of a UFO or the Abominable Snowman? It has to communicate something spiritually because of a symbolic dimension, and if it does that, if it functions as a symbol, it doesn't really matter how it started, as a factual report or a myth.",1184198400,5,3444,4.492012779552716

(Are negative stars possible?)

The director of this pedantic and heavy handed film over-reaches in his title, which purports to be a defense of atheism.  Instead, he limits his salvo to a broadside on Christianity and the historicity of Christ.  He seems to argue that Jesus was not a real figure, for example, just a folklore character.  This ignores the fact that some contemporaneous historians - Josephus and Pliny both make specific reference to Jesus.  It is hard to follow the thread of the argument.

The movie seems to have an axe to grind, winding up at the private Christian academy he attended as a child, grilling the headmaster.  This is painful to watch.  The debate between ""science"" and faith may never be resolved, but it seems arrogant to presume that science is by definition superior to faith.  The dude is a Michael Moore-wannabe.

The rest is either a rehash of the scriptural account of Jesus' life (The first three chapters) or a demonstration of how little most present-day Christians know of the subject beyond what they have learned from their respective churches (the last three chapters).

On the other hand, if you fit this description, then you really do need to see the middle three chapters. I have spent years studying the archaaeology/anthropology/history of that era in that region, and this fifteen minute segment provides an accurate summary of the results of that study. If you are starting from scratch, this paints an overall landscape that you can use to fill in bookshelves full of expansion and detail if it interests you. If you already have that bookshelf, then you will be disappointed at how much supporting information is only hinted at or just completely left out. I would have preferred that the time devoted to exposing the darker side of current Christianity have been used to flesh out the information presented in support of the title.

This DVD will definitely startle the believer who is just starting to expand his horizons, but at the same time be disappointing because too much of the presentation was basically ""filler"" that didn't contribute to the stated subject.",1183680000,2,1372,5.0131578947368425

2454879,2,B000CAPZBC,"I was looking forward to an entertaining and instructional documentary and it was to some degree.  The documentary was factual regarding religion and the bible, but I felt Brian Flemming made a few segments too personal.  Further, many of the jokes went overboard and would make most people cringe.  I did like the interviews, especially those with Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins.",1182902400,,380,5.096774193548387
2454880,4,B000CAPZBC,"I don't know that I've ever had such mixed feelings about a DVD I've watched like I had with this one. Before I ordered it, when I read some of the negative reviews beforehand, I thought that the reviewers were probably just being close-minded. But now I understand where some of them were coming from when writing their reviews about the DVD.

If you've never learned a lot of the information that's contained in this DVD before, then you may learn things that you'll consider to be new and insightful for you. And if you believe that what you've learned in the Bible is God's word and it's infallible, then you'll probably be outraged by what you see and hear in this DVD.

Before watching this DVD I'd read ""The Dark Side of Christianity"" by Helen Ellerbe, ""The Jesus Puzzle"" by Earl Doherty, and ""In God's Hands"" by David Yallop. All of these books I purchased on Amazon and I highly recommend them if the subject matter of what's in this DVD interests you.

While I've rated this DVD 4 stars because I feel the information will be valuable if you're learning about it for the first time, the problem I have with this DVD is the fact that Brian Flemming seemed to be more interested in ridiculing Christianity when making this DVD then he was in making a great, informative DVD on the subject. Showing clips of old movies about Jesus at high speed to make them look really stupid may not have been his best choice here. And sitting down for an interview under false pretenses with the Principal of the Christian school he attended while growing up, and trying his best to embarrass the Principal may not have been the best choice to make when making this movie either. But at least Flemming left in the part where the Principal excuses himself from the interview mentioning that this was not what he was told by Flemming in advance that the interview would focus on. And insisting during this interview to this man who has devoted his life to Christianity that all the students who attend his school should be given a warning about all the bad things that Christianity will bring into their lives, was quite a bit out in left field, too.

In some ways it just seemed that the purpose of making this DVD was for Flemming to get back at Christianity for all he felt it had done to hurt him in his life, which again is different than just making a DVD about Christianity. And at the same time I found myself agreeing with a lot of what Flemming believes about Christianity, too. It's just that he presented it with so much bitterness.

Of even more value to me than the movie was the bonus audio interview on the DVD with Earl Doherty, the author of the book ""The Jesus Puzzle."" If you haven't read Doherty's book you will probably find this interview to have some very valuable information in it. But strangely the audio of this interview is played along with the video of the movie playing at the same time, even though the audio interview does not coincide with the scenes being shown at the same time from the movie. So I ended up just listening to the audio interview without watching the movie at the same time so that I could better concentrate on and understand what was being said in the interview.

There's some good information in this DVD, but it seems to be delivered with the primary intention of ridiculing and defaming Christianity, rather than serving as information about what we may have never learned about Christianity before that we really need to know about.",1181865600,15,3482,4.545454545454546
2454881,1,B000CAPZBC,"Let me start off by saying that I was a film major for several years, but I'm now majoring in both History and Theology, so I have adequate background to critique Flemming's work. In short, Flemming's film was just not very good. The background music was the best part of the whole thing. He made a lot of bald face claims without providing adequate proof. In fact, several times his claims are outright wrong or misleading.

Case in point:

""We used the earliest possible date for the Gospels."" (70 A.D. for Mark, 80-90 A.D. for Matthew and Luke, 90-100 for John). In actuality, there are sufficent reasons to place Mark at 60 A.D. and Luke & Acts at about 65 A.D., Matthew at 70 A.D., and John between 70-90 A.D. (A GUIDE TO THE BIBLE by Antonio Fuentes, University of Navarre). Even if the latter dates are wrong, the fact that a fair amount of scholars argue for earlier dates, indicates that there are earlier possible, thus making his statement false. Flemming only uses the dates he uses because they make the skeptical argument more compeling.

Further, he blatantly misuses a quote of Jesus: ""But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me."" (Luke 19:27). Flemming presents it as a often overlooked quote of Jesus, without really explaining why. Well, in fact, the quote, in context, is placed within a parable of Jesus where a king Jesus is using as a metaphor gives the command of death. The parable is dipicting the justice of God against those who claim Faith to God, but don't act upon it, and the reward for those who hate him. He's not commanding Jihad. Remember, if you read the Bible like a fundamentalist, you'll get fundamentalist conclusions.

Besides those issues, Flemming's interviews range from the interesting to the out right irrelevant. In particular, the interviews with Sam Harris and Richard Carrier don't really add anything to the supposed topic at hand. Really, after the first third of the film, the documentary just becomes a ""Christianity Sucks"" flick. Again, with very little other than opinion.

If Flemming wanted to make the film truly groundbreaking, why not have a myriad of scholars provide truly critical analysis of the Jesus story. The only person in the film qualified in that department was Jesus Seminar Fellow, Robert Price. But he appears on screen for just a few soundbites. If anything, why not have Price and Earl Doherty, the ""scholar"" interviewed on the audio commentary, come on and really rip the Jesus story apart? Instead Flemming dismisses the Jesus story as false with little argument or evidence. FYI: Appeals to reason are not evidence!

All in all, this was a slick, yet poorly executed work that harkens to the cult hit ""Loose Change."" Though at least those guys had a compeling argument. Frankly, one would be better off watching the PBS Frontline documentary ""From Jesus to Christ."" It may not be perfect, but it's better than Flemming's.",1181001600,12,2974,4.798828125
2454882,5,B000CAPZBC,"When you can take such a serious subject, and challenge it, and yet do it in a tastfull and humorous way, you've made a great documentary.

2454883,1,B000CAPZBC,"I bought this DVD anticipating that it would graphically portray and bring to light the scholarly works that have been written on this topic.

Earl Dougherty's book ""The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus"" is a serious study of Paul's writings and it poses reasonable questions on the topic of the historicity of Jesus.

""The Jesus Mysteries: Was the ""Original Jesus"" a Pagan God?"" by Freke and Gandy approaches this topic from another angle - showing how the pertinent events in the life story of Jesus are pretty much the same ones that were applied to many other deities who preceded him - some by more than 2,000 years.

These topics are mentioned lightly in the film but not well explained. The Doctrine of Diabolical Mimicry should have been elaborated upon so that the viewer could learn more and be able to judge honestly if he/she agrees with this presentation or not.

Both of these books are written intelligently and at all times they are respectful of the subject matter that they deal with. They probe the topic intellectually, academically and historically - without having a personal ax to grind.

That is where this movie fails miserably. The historicity of Jesus is discussed fleetingly. Close to 100% of all research and relevant materials are omitted. Rather than present an honest argument and be open to rebuttal - Christians and their faith are merely ridiculed and presented as menaces to society.

Three `experts' are brought in for the `prosecution' - atheists only - and there is never a presentation for the `defense'. There is no balance, no rebuttal, and more importantly - the subject matter is not presented honestly or accurately.

[...]

There are numerous scenes that serve to do hatchet jobs on Christians and their faith. A few legitimate `wackos' are presented and they are mixed with interviews of everyday ordinary citizens as though they are all part of the same great cabal. Then, one of the experts comes on to say that 44% of the people in America take the Christian faith seriously enough to believe in it - AND - these people all have the ability to vote or even to hold public office - AND - this is a very dangerous scenario. Just about any idea that this speaker disagrees with is presented as dangerous and menacing to society. This is overkill and it lacks credibility.
The movie is not a history docu-drama. [...]

I believed that I was purchasing a well researched documentary. [...]

[...]

And, if you flip through the titles on the DVD, there is a 58 second commercial for Universism which is a belief system that ""focuses on faith in reason, inspiration in nature, and hope in progress"" and the viewer is directed to surf over to Richard Carrier's website to learn about Universism. So - after more than an hour of having an organized religion beaten up and ridiculed - we get a sales pitch for a `secular' religion. [...]",1179964800,35,2954,4.7952755905511815

2454887,1,B000CAPZBC,"As someone who tries to be a studied Christian I was obviously skeptical of the claims made by this movie.  It turns out that skeptical was too kind of a word.  In my opinion, if these film makers had to use the amount of deception that they did to try and prove their point, we Christians must really be on to something.

This movie ranks up there with ""Loose Change"" as an honest look at the pros and cons of a debate.  Of course, a lot of the fans of this film would probably take that as a compliment.

Another opinion in this debate:

The following comes from ""What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck,""The Saturday Evening Post, Oct. 26, 1929, p. 17. The questions are posed by Viereck; the reply to each is by Einstein.

Viereck: ""You accept the historical existence of Jesus?""

Einstein: ""Unquestionably. No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life. How different, for instance, is the impression which we receive from an account of legendary heroes of antiquity like Theseus. Theseus and other heroes of his type lack the authentic vitality of Jesus.""

Viereck: ""Ludwig Lewisohn, in one of his recent books, claims that many of the sayings of Jesus paraphrase the sayings of other prophets.""

Einstein: ""No man can deny the fact that Jesus existed, nor that his sayings are beautiful. Even if some them have been said before, no one has expressed them so divinely as he.""",1178496000,7,1512,4.6716981132075475
2454888,2,B000CAPZBC,"I'm someone who falls into the category of the filmmaker: someone who grew up a devout Christian who has now, in adulthood, come to question the validity of ALL religions.

With that in mind, I was really looking forward to a factual, well-presented case for some of the things I already believed in my heart to be true. This film was none of those things for me.

The first thing that bothered me about this was the presentation itself. The guy doing the voice-over (who eventually reveals himself) had a tone of arrogance and ""forced hipness"" (if that makes sense) about him that put me off immediately. The music was equally annoying, with small phrases of generic loops and voices repeated over and over again designed to, I assume, add to the desired feel of ""Wow, this is such a cutting edge, irreverent piece of work."" Again, it seemed forced and unnecessary, and was incredibly distracting.

Where the film really began to bother me was when it descended into blatant dishonesty and manipulation when presenting its arguments. For example, there was a Bible verse attributed to Jesus, from Luke, which basically said (I'm paraphrasing here because I can't remember the exact verse): ""Those people who would not accept me as king, bring them here and kill them before me."" This quote was onscreen, and underneath it was attributed to, simply, Jesus, complete with ominous background music, etc. The problem here? This quote was taken totally out of context. The quote was part of a parable that Jesus was telling, and was delivered BY A CHARACTER IN THAT PARABLE, not by Jesus himself.

Sure, you could make a reasoned argument that Jesus was comparing himself to that character in the parable, but to not let the viewer know the FULL CONTEXT of that quote, and then allow them to make up their own minds, is wrong, and it's just as dishonest and pathetic as what so many Christian teachers do when trying to convince their flock of something in a dishonest, manipulative way. HUGE points deducted for that. There is no excuse, and the fact that the filmmakers can't see how ironically hypocritical this kind of tactic is really hurts their credibility all around. If I WAS a devout Christian watching this, giving it a chance, I would have turned it off immediately after seeing this section.

In the final ""big reveal,"" where the filmmaker goes back to confront the man who heads up the Christian school the filmmaker attended as a boy, the whole thing descends into a very uncomfortable, mean-spirited attack on the guy that I found unfair. For the record, I think the man's beliefs and the school's beliefs were and are wrong and often ridiculous. But that doesn't mean the man is to be equated with some sort of monster, destroying the lives of children, which is how he's presented here. It's obvious that the interview was set up deceptively by the filmmaker, who eventually tries to become Michael Moore and take the conversation into an accusatory stage, basically attacking the man's belief system and his integrity/character in a very aggressive way. Michael Moore this guy is NOT. While I might feel that the man's beliefs DESERVED to be challenged, I felt this part of the film got too personal and just seemed nasty and sad. As another reviewer said, it was obviously a personal grudge by the filmmaker. In fact, the principal of the school comes off as the level-headed one here, and the filmmaker comes off as some sort of arrogant, pushy d-bag. I'm sure that wasn't the intention. The final scene, where the filmmaker looks into the camera and says, ""I deny the holy spirit,"" made him seem like a lunatic, quite frankly. It was also creepy, rivaling some of those shots from ""Blair Witch.""

Now, all that said, I understand the emotions involved. I'm someone coming out of a lifetime of Christian ""training,"" and I've now come to the point in my life where I feel I've been ""hoodwinked and bamboozled."" That is a frustrating, anger-inducing thought, and sometimes you DO want to lash out at people who still believe things like eternal torture in hell, etc. But I bought this hoping to view a really well-done piece on the facts of Jesus' existence (or non-existence) and other facts about the true origins of Christianity that so many Christians are ignorant about, etc. Instead, what I got was a disjointed rant from a guy who obviously still has a lot of emotional issues to work through regarding his own journey.

It would've been great to hear about how this guy began questioning his faith. Would've been great to hear more about the origins of various Christian holidays, about the historical evidence of Jesus' existence (of which there is none that is substantial that I know of), about so MANY things. But, at only 60 minutes, this is like one long trailer for a film that isn't coming. ""The Film that Wasn't There"" is a more apt title here.

This film will only turn off devout Christians, because it mocks their faith right out of the gate, for the most part. While I might feel that some of it DESERVES to be mocked, that's not always the best way to start an argument/debate with someone.

So, to sum up, I'm not taking shots at the film because of my religious beliefs. Quite the contrary. This is from someone who is probably in agreement with most of what is presented here. But I think this was a poorly made, disjointed failure of a film that could have been so much more. Hopefully, someone else will do what this movie should have done and make something more palatable, engaging and enlightening.",1177113600,21,5543,4.7357512953367875

The reviewer who was angry about the price should have just went to his local library or Blockbuster. The guy who made this movie inspired me to seek more knowledge and that automatically gets it a thumbs up. The music on this dvd is great and the visuals help a lot. My favorite part is when the Hispanic guy is asked how the message of Christianity was spread after Jesus was gone. His answer, ""Ughh, it was by word of mouth, and ughhh, it spread."" The part which is the strongest myth breaker is the parallels of the story of Jesus to Dionysus. The story of Dionysus contains events and themes that are the exactly the same as the so called son of God, such as his divine parentage, violent death, descent into the underworld, and subsequent resurrection to immortal life in heaven where he sits near his father's throne. So the beliefs in Christianity are taken straight from the Roman Empire's pagan mythological history. The devil did have a part in this scandal and it was not in counterfeiting Jesus in advance. He has 2 billion people fooled into thinking Jesus was divine and that is the greatest deception anyone or any supernatural being has ever accomplished. You must understand that the devil promised God he would decieve mankind from knowing the truth as much as he could. Charles Darwin and his friends were also part of the devils work.

The thing that this movie or documentary lacks is that it is short and filled with interviews. It thinks that if the story of Jesus being divine is not true, then God does not exist. This is so stupid. Nobody will ever make the dvd which disproves Islam. You can try, but it will always come up short. Jesus was sent by God as a messenger to the Jewish people just like it says in Matthew 15:24. The God of Jesus is the God of Muhammad. They both preached the same thing; Worship of One God. But Jesus had his message dissected by Paul and the Roman Empire. Only fragments remain of the true message of Jesus while the Quran has not even changed a letter since it was completed. The Quran is the miracle which allows people to use their own reason and common sense to decide if God exists, not just accepting Jesus crucifixion and resurrection as proof of God. For those who are Atheists and doubt the existence of God, take a look at the scientific miracles in the Quran. The expansion of the universe 51:47 The separation of water with barriers 55:19-20 The stages of embryonic development: 23:12-14 and of course the Big Bang ""Have not those who disbelieved known that the heavens and the earth were one connected entity, then We separated them?..."" 21:30. These words were written more than a thousand years ago. It has come to my attention that people have tried to say that this information already existed and the Prophet just copied them from other sources. Every single one of these facts needed a microscope or telescope or some device to actually see them. Remember that the Prophet was ignorant and could not read or write so he wasn't an astronomer or physician. I know I will get blasted by people who think Islam is a terrorist religion or the Prophet was a womanizer, etc. The bottom line is that these scientific truths could not have come from any human in the year 600 and you owe it to yourself to investigate.",1174348800,5,3388,4.526916802610114

2454900,5,B000CAPZBC,"I hesitated before giving this five stars, since it has some real flaws, but between the documentary and the featured materials, it offers so much information, and so much direction to other sources, that I would strongly recommend it to those interested in the historicity of Jesus and Christianity.  It is a wonderful demonstration of the power of electronic media.  In addition to the documentary itself, it includes valuable features, including extended interviews with those featured in the documentary, and a tour of the sources of further information,  including links to a variety of web sites.  The links include some of Flemming's opponents; he certainly isn't afraid to direct his audience to them.  Apparently most of this is old hat to some people, but I learned a great deal and there are always beginners.  I borrowed the copy I watched, but I intend to buy my own.

The documentary could do with a little reworking. I think that presenting Charles Manson as an example of Christians is pretty dubious. Fleming also very occasionally includes obscene language, which I would prefer he didn't.  It seems likely to alienate some of his potentially sympathetic audience. My other issue is the inclusion of material from The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-Of-The-Christ-Definitive-Edition-HD/dp/B007HWTQQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion Of The Christ Definitive Edition [HD</a>] by Mel Gibson. I do believe in copyright, and I hope that was fair use. Come to think of it, if someone is going to sit through those segments, why am I worrying about a few obscenities?  In the end, I wasn't convinced of everything, but I look forward to further investigation of the matter.

I am not under the impression that a documentary needs to be objective or present all sides (unless it claims to be doing that), just that it be factual and fair, which is not the same thing.  I would no more fault Flemming for failing to feature more traditional theologians than I would fault Billy Graham for failing to invite atheists to speak at his rallies.  He presents support for his thesis, just as numerous Christian productions have presented for theirs.  As it is, he presents interviews with Christian believers, and treats them respectfully, allowing them to speak for the most part without interruption.  Parts of interviews cut for lack of space are included in the features.  He perhaps should have presented more information about the communications leading up to his interview with Dr. Sipus.  He discusses this on his blog on slumdance.com.  I don't think that Sipus' description of the interview coincides with what we actually saw.  He was permitted to speak at length on his philosophy of teaching, and got angry as soon as Flemming began to ask questions.

Depending on how narrowly one interprets the title, Flemming did miss one possible argument.  That is that there could have been a historical person Jesus (although variants in the time line might argue against this),  and that the mythological elements were accreted to his life.  Of course, one could still argue that even if there was a Rabbi Jesus there wasn't a divine Jesus, and so it is still a GOD who never was.

I don't think that it will convert committed Christians, but it has a lot of food for thought for those willing to consider the subject.",1171670400,5,3388,5.142335766423358

He is very mocking and one sided when it comes to anything in this video.  I am glad I had the chance to view it without having to buy it.  The gap that he suggests ""exists"", never mentions the book of acts which will take you through the early church, even a basic book on world religions will be able to tell you that.  Not only that, but the author of the DVD will also neglect to inform you that Mithras, the god that is supposedly so close to Christ's life in detail was believed in after the events that had taken place in Christ's life.  Even the title alone should tell you that the author of the DVD is claiming that Christ was god.  Who said he was?  I would like to see the sequel ""the old testament god who wasn't there"".  Good luck with that.  Just so you know, I am not a christian, but I do believe Christ was the Christ of the old testament, so don't just run and believe Christianity either or any of these boneheaded men who think they know everything, just because they like to hear their own voice and attempt to sound intelligible.  Research is the key, fancy graphics and interviews with regular people won't cut it.  Note that the Author never challenged anyone with the background to cut him into pieces.

2454902,1,B000CAPZBC,"As a life-long atheist, I thought a documentary on the existence - or lack thereof - of Jesus might prove intellectually stimulating, thought provoking, and might spawn some interesting discussion.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

Brian Flemming executes his abhorrence of Christianity with all the eloquence of a John Stossel ranting for the flip-side.

He carefully chooses scholars who will support his first assertion that Jesus never existed. The rebuke is a collection of snippets from fundamentalist Christians interviewed in a parking lot - people he sought out to make look foolish in comparison. The Jesus existence issue might have been interesting had it been the focal point of the film, and had he explored in great depth any of his theories as to why Jesus couldn't have possibly existed. Instead, he creates graphically inferior timelines, cheesy recreations of Christ's life (for those of us who missed out on that story in our all-American upbringing), brings in some really bad repetitive home-computer-style techno, and then flashes about PowerPoint style headlines and Bible quotes. This combination is supposed to prove his position beyond a shadow of a doubt. Or maybe he's just hoping lame graphics and bad techno will distract us from the lack of real information. He falls far, far short of the mark here, but I forgave his error and assumed that amateur cinematography didn't exclude the possibility of there being a good point in there... somewhere.

Rather than carry the first thought through to completion, he skips instead to this rabid, mindless sort of Christian bashing. You'd think as an atheist, I might be amused - but it was more just pitiful and sad, and sort of humiliating to watch.

And then he exposes his real modus operandi. As the emotionally damaged byproduct of a fundamentalist upbringing he is incensed over the lack of logic made easily available by his educational outlet to refute his childhood fears of burning in hell. He decides, climactically, to drive this dramatic note home by confronting the root of all evil - his grade school principal. A meeting that for him may have been unbelievably liberating, but leaves this viewer squirming in her seat and looking about anxiously for an exit. I can't stand to watch people make fools of themselves so openly, unabashedly. It's just so disconcerting.

This interview ends abruptly. The principal tried to warn poor Brian, but Brian keeps the tape running to capture the principal disclosing that he had to be tricked into the meeting. I suppose you could view all this as being very Michael Moore. But Michael Moore has wit and humor and savvy, and frankly Charlton Heston was a far more entertaining target.

All in all, this was a very sad attempt at turning a life's frustration into some coherent logical argument. There are A LOT of good arguments out there for atheism. There are A LOT of good arguments out there against Christianity. This 'documentary' is neither. In truth, I resent it, and the connotation that atheists would present a rational argument in this manner.",1169164800,139,3086,5.015625

The movie goes on to explore the existance of god and religion in general.

This is a fairly low-budget, documentary style movie. You will not mistake it for a Hollywood blockbuster. Still, it is reasonably professionally done and you won't mistake it for someone's home movie, either.

This movie features an on-camera interview with Sam Harris, author of End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation.

It also wasn't very scholarly and balanced. Sure, he had scholars who were aligned with his views, but he relied on everyday clueless Christians off the street to represent the other side.

The music and animation throughout the movie was pleasant and interesting, but again, distracting. Overall, it was really lacking meat. I got way more substance from reading the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and Misquoting Jesus by Bart D. Ehrman.

2454909,4,B000CAPZBC,"After seeing the name ""Richard Dawkins"" in connection with this DVD, I expected a shrill, humorless screed from a fundamentalist atheist. I was pleasantly surprised to discover instead an engaging, witty, irreverent movie (with  a great soundtrack) that challenges viewers to reconsider their assumptions about very existence of one of history's most pivotal figures, Jesus Christ. The filmmaker, himself a recovering Christian fundamentalist, draws on varied, primarily non-controversial (at least, in academic circles) sources to argue that Jesus of Nazareth was, in fact, a mythical figure with no basis in history. The filmmaker, in the role of equal opportunity offender, selects particularly odious bible verses to underscore the bind in which many ""moderate Christians"" find themselves (i.e., having to reconcile their contemporary mores with scriptures whose values are often anything but contemporary). Finally, in one of the most uncomfortable scenes I've ever come across in documentary film, the filmmaker meets with his former high school principal and confronts him over the practice of indoctrinating children and confusing beliefs with facts. (Seeing the principal twist in the wind when asked in what sense ""hell"" was a ""reality"" given the absolute lack of empirical support for it was itself worth the ticket price.)

Does he provide ironclad proof that Jesus did not exist and that Christianity is based completely in ahistorical myth? Of course not, given that this is an hour long documentary and the subject itself is complex and far from agreed upon even by scholars. The questions he raises allow the viewer to consider this possibility, though, and that is why this film is so valuable.

As is my wont, I do have a few minor bones to pick with the filmmaker. His use of selected Bible verses to underscore his points is done without contextualizing the quotes and also without indicating the source of the translation, which is definitely problematic. As well, I rankled at his glibness in describing the murdered Branch Davidians as ""crispy"" cultists or somesuch; instead of mocking these dead, many of whom were innocent kids, he could have used this as another opportunity to skewer Christian hypocrisy, in this case that of a ""Christian"" nation whose government murders people who ""misuse"" the First Amendment.

Sadly, this movie probably won't be viewed by those who most desperately need to see it. Instead, this absent audience, the current crop of smart kids growing up like the filmmaker (or this reviewer) in fundamentalist Christian homes, will continue to be stifled and taught that doubting and thinking critically are sinful habits of mind.",1167696000,10,2679,5.311320754716981
2454910,5,B000CAPZBC,"Okay, remember that Copernicus guy? Poor Copernicus. Nobody believed him when he said the Earth revolved around the Sun. Even when he gave proof, he suffered for it. Yet, his discovery was the great epiphany of science, the point upon which everything changed.

Like Copernicus and his ""Commentariolus,"" this DVD lays out the basics of the next great epiphany in historical research: the case that Jesus was based on a myth and not an historical person. I liken it to the ""Commentariolus"" and not ""De revolutionibus orbium coelestium"" because the DVD is a bit brief. If you want the whole nine yards, read popular writer Earl Doherty or scholar Robert Price, or even the great Professor Emeritus Dr. John Gager from Princeton University, who talks around the subject of Paul in his work, quietly building a case for a Pauline mystery religion. All their books are available here on Amazon.

To get the most out of this DVD, though, you've got to set aside all your assumptions about this Jesus fellow. Everything. Doesn't matter if you're a believer brimming with religious faith or an unbeliever who's always thought, ""Aren't there, like, Roman records of Jesus?"" Um, no. There are no ""Roman records"" or anything like that -- just an interpolated mention in one historical document written decades after Jesus supposedly died. If you watch this DVD with an open mind, you'll be amazed to find how deeply the assumptions of Jesus' existence are ingrained, even in secular culture.

Anway, just watch it. There's too much at stake in society today to let dishonesty cloud our thinking, especially about history.",1167350400,15,1610,4.977695167286245
2454911,5,B000CAPZBC,"As someone who remembers well what it was like to be brought up within the world of born-again evangelical Christianity, only to eventually reject it completely, I felt a certain kinship with the author of this movie. He has created an excellent short documentary on Christianity as seen from a vantage point only a few of us have ever attained. Those who remain in Christianity's grip may grimace at the failure of some Christians when interviewed, but by the time the end of the movie is reached, they may be downright stunned by what they will probably (but erroneously) call ""foolish pride"".

The documentary offers a short synopsis of what Christianity actually is, then proceeds to start deconstructing it, often with very powerful little tidbits, ending with a personal statement of faith that I found more brave than any statement I heard when I was in the midst of Christianity myself.  The trip back to his childhood Christian academy as a different person than when he left, is a journey all people make at some point in their lives. He just had the added drama of having rejected what he was taught as a child. Those of us who have done likewise, that were willing to rise above the pedestrian philistine parochialism of their small childhood world, will feel a deep rapport with this man as he seeks to confront the demons of his past.

Even better than the feature itself though are the over 200 minutes of additional material, including extended interviews with some of the people that appear in the movie, the most memorable being  Richard Dawkins, and the MIT guy that reveals that rather than being finely tuned to produce life, the universe actually seems finely tuned to produce black holes.

2454913,5,B000CAPZBC,"I think it helps to approach this film without a very specific set of expectations of what it *should* be (strong, wide-ranging, super-rational atheist manifesto etc.).  On first viewing I was disappointed too, thinking it too quirky, irreverent in tone, and not hard-hitting enough (considering the scope of the duping job central to the movie's premise).  After some thought, a peek at the supplementary materials, a bit of independent research and then a second viewing (with a fairer idea of what to expect style-wise), I liked it much, much better.  In fact, some of the points blew past me the first time (the audio track occasionally drowned out key points, which were seldom re-iterated).  Brian Flemming does put his own stamp on it, but this is part of its charm.

I'm also frankly amazed at the unsophisticated, actually quite vitriolic and low-ball, attempts at rebuttal by the clearly enraged (and very unforgiving :)) Christian reviewers.",1166572800,14,952,5.116129032258065
2454914,4,B000CAPZBC,"There are centuries of critical research on Christianity; as such, a movie that wants to make the case against the religion and its messiah has a lot to measure up against. Brian Flemming's film falls short, though it does present some of the historical evidence that the Christ-story was written long after Jesus supposedly lived, and that it parallels many other mythologies.

Given the low budget, this section of the film is well made and entertaining, and the interviews are reasonably interesting. This is not a scholarly movie, of course: Flemming follows the footsteps of Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock, though he doesn't possess their aesthetic finesse. There are small errors, but the essence of Flemming's message here is correct; if Jesus ever existed, what we believe to know about him almost certainly has next to nothing to do with the facts.

Like Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" ended in a controversial confrontation with Charlton Heston, Flemming ends his film by confronting the superintendent of his fundamentalist Christian high school. That interview might have worked if he had related his questions to his personal story as a student, but as a generic atheist/theist confrontation, with the atheist being the aggressive questioner, it does not help Flemming's cause. The specific doctrine Flemming was exposed to -- that blaspheming the ""Holy Spirit"" leads to eternal damnation -- should have been explored here as the clearly abusive and horrifying concept which it is.

In Flemming's defense, it cannot be argued that the interviewee, Ronald Sipus, was truly surprised: As Flemming notes in his blog, he had submitted questions beforehand which were clearly critical of Christianity. Perhaps Sipus had expected to be thrown only pseudo-critical softball questions from an ex-student, but there is no evidence that he was deliberately misled. Unfortunately, Flemming does not mention that fact in the film.

A better film against Christianity can certainly be made. The case against Jesus is much stronger when one understands the chaotic processes through which Christianity arose as a religion, through which it systematically absorbed and then eliminated paganism, and through which it eventually became the dominant, unquestionable truth (only to lead into a Dark Age in much of Europe). Christianity is built upon a long history of fanaticism, ignorance and bloodshed, which is the reason even fundamentalist sects tend to shun its history or make up their own (Mormonism).

Christianity has little to fear from this documentary. Flemming's film may inspire some viewers to do further research, and cause some doubt among the kind of poorly informed feelgood Christians he interviewed. But, to be honest, most liberal agnostics you'd find in the streets of New York or San Francisco probably could not give an accurate summary of Big Bang theory either: ignorance is not limited to believers, making arrogance hard to justify.

That said, in a world dominated by increasingly dangerous expressions of faith, any clear and vocal expression of nonbelief is a candle in the dark. Hopefully, other films on the topic will follow, and Flemming will hone his own skills to produce more compelling works. Those who condemn this film and its maker should follow their own gospel: ""Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.""

Yes, you are in the minority, because the vast majority of the people in this world believe in either Jesus or some form of God. I guess that makes a heck of a lot of ""delusional"" people eh? LOL.

What always makes me laugh about you atheists is that you proudly preach ""there is no God, he's a myth, etc."" yet you never present concrete evidence to suggest the reasoning or purpose of the existence of this world and our universe. All you can ever come up with is ""it started with the big bang."" Well whoopty-do! I might even agree with you on the logic of how the process started, but you still don't have the mind power, and that includes all the world's greatest scientists, to comprehend anything beyond what you can see through the uncovering of fossils, or microscopes, or telescopes. It is the ultimate portrayal of arrogance to suggest you know all the answers, like so many atheistic scientists and their followers do.

Ultimately, atheists are little more than extremist leaders of another religion by itself, and the word preached in their church is to mock and laugh at those who have faith in a divine power. They spend every waking moment trying to drag people of faith down into their world of non-belief(usually brought on by a non-religious upbringing, or a tragic event in their lives), and they thump their ""bible"" full of artifacts and so-called ""evidence"" gathered by a lot of imperfect human beings whose lab experiments have gone no further than the moon in our night sky.

First of all, it is evident that the author of this film still harbors great resentment toward his old Christian school principal because suddenly, at the end of the film, the author interjects himself interviewing the principal via attack mode (the principal, by the mid of the interview, realizes the interview he agreed to do with the author is under false pretenses, and after he says so, he abruptly ends the interview, which we would have done as well under those awkward circumstances. Because of the author's tacky way, or rather, dishonest way in dealing with his old principal, it made the principal look right, not the accusing athiest author).

It sets out to dismiss the notion of Jesus as an actual historic figure but wanders off on marginally related tangents. Interviews with Sam Harris, Alan Dundes, Robert Price, and Richard Carrier are spot on and very enlightening in approaching the problem from physical, anthropologic, and philosophic perspectives. But Flemming strays into subjects like the brutality of Mel Gibson's ""Passion of Christ"" and the lunatic ravings of a rapture fanatic which, although interesting in their own right, seem to get away from the topic of whether Jesus was real.

The film really loses it for me when Flemming goes all Michael Moore and grills his former Christian school principal on the contradictions inherent in the Christian faith. Of course, the principal is embarrassed, says he was deceived about the purpose of the interview, and storms off a la Charlton Heston in ""Bowling for Columbine."" C'mon Brian. What did you think the guy was gonna do; break down, admit his whole career has been a farce, and surrender his faith on camera? It goes on for too long and you soon find yourself sympathizing with the principal.

The film is definitely worth the price of admission for its in-depth interviews with some of the great atheist thinkers of today (and the kernel of hope it offers that such brilliant voices may one day help break the stranglehold that Christianity and Islam have on free thought in the modern world).

So does the story of Hercules. But no one takes the Hercules story to be true! And elements A...N of the Jesus story can each *individually or in pairs* be found in various of these 26 legends. So... "" If you don't spot any fallacious reasoning in the preceding, this is the documentary for you! The production values are pretty good (cheapie old Jesus-film footage aside), though intellectually, the whole thing feels like a sort of college film class project made by a ""village atheist"" type, who revels in cheap shots, scare-mongering (about those fundies who are no doubt going to sieze power any day now), a gotcha-question interview, and objections born of misunderstanding (e.g. thinking that evangelicals want an ancient-Israel style theocracy, with death penalty for gays - oh, yeah, that's on the agenda!) A favorite cheap shot - attributing these words to Jesus - ""But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me"" - words spoken by a character in a parable Jesus tells in Luke 17. Honestly, knowing something about the subject, it was hard to sit all the way through this stinker. And you won't have to know much to smell a rat. Sadly, the theologically and biblically illiterate crowd - e.g. who thought that Dogma or the Da Vinci code were remotely accurate - will find this kind of propaganda-like presentation impressive. It comes as no surprise at all, two-thirds of the way through, when we learn that the director is a bitter ex-fundie himself. In a way, it's like a certain kind of religious film, in that it never even tries to rise above preaching to the choir.",1162425600,21,2688,4.82034632034632
2454924,3,B000CAPZBC,"Being an atheist myself it always pains me when I see a documentary on atheism that starts out great and then falls apart right when it's starting to get good. This is unfortunately the failing of ""The God Who Wasn't There.""

The documentarian brings up a lot of interesting points about the timelines of when the bible was written, when events took place and generally does a great job of pointing out the flaws of Christian dogma as it relates to the bible. The first half hour of this movie is exactly what I was looking for in a documentary concerning Atheism. It was solidly based in proven facts, it let the viewer figure out the point without bludgeoning them to death with it, and it transitioned smoothly from one point to the next without pointing an accusatory finger at people and saying ""believe this or you're dumb.""

Where it breaks down is in the last section of the movie where the documentor decides to go visit his old (extremely religious) school. There we learn only one interesting point, and the whole documentary sort of falls apart as the documentor decides to confront his old school principal about something that the documentor has lost all objectivity on (mainly because it was so personal to him).

Instead of coming off as an objective look at atheism vs Christianity, it ends on a sour note of a raving man/child still angry at being tormented by the broken logic of Christian dogma. It's compelling, but it's inconsistent with the rest of the documentary and ultimately sabotauges what I thought could have been a great movie to show to some of my Christian friends to get them thinking.

Still, the points are good and well thought out so I give it 3 stars.",1162425600,29,1691,4.645484949832776
2454925,5,B000CAPZBC,"A very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex Christian. We need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general. I wish some brave person would do a film about how Christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective. This film touched on the subject, but it was not really the focus of the documentary. Perhaps we will be ""blessed"" by a further exploration of the subject in the future.",1162339200,18,476,4.888888888888889

2454927,3,B000CAPZBC,"My own interpretation of this documentary is that it represents narrator Brian Flemming's personal journey from Christian to atheist. Raised a Christian, this particular journey concludes in his childhood chapel where he finally commits the one unforgivable sin as written in the Bible and denies the Holy Spirit.

The DVD begins by laying out the historical case that not only was Jesus not the son of God, which is already obvious to some of us, but that he may not even have existed as a man. I was highly skeptical of this seemingly hyperbolic claim at first but the evidence presented in this and other sources (such as The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man by Robert M. Price) is quite convincing. It seems cogent that the writers of the gospels took the mythical figure of Jesus and merely placed him in an historical setting, and did not believe themselves to be writing actual history.

The DVD also notes that the myths surrounding Jesus' life (e.g.; virgin birth, born on Dec. 25, son of a God, died and rose again 3 days later) are duplicated in numerous other mythical tales which all precede the time in which Jesus is said to have lived. These include the myths of Hercules, Oedipus, Romulus, Theseus, Perseus, Zeus and Apollo. The church's official response to this embarrassing defect in Christianity's verisimilitude is that Satan anticipated the life of Jesus and counterfeited it in advance.

A decent amount of time in the documentary is spent interviewing average Christians, most of whom are coming out of a Billy Graham convention. Why interview regular Christians instead of well-known and erudite theologians? Because the point to take away from them is that most people give no thought to the logic or empirical justifications for their beliefs and indeed are quite content to remain blissfully unaware of the origins or historical correctness of them.

The most interesting contributions to the documentary come from Sam Harris and Robert M. Price, and I think I would have preferred sixty minutes of just watching them talk (luckily there is more of them in the extended interviews). The DVD also contains at least five minutes of material on The Passion of the Christ, which I felt to be a non sequitur. I don't find the documentary to be an important contribution to atheist thought. It's worth watching once or twice but most atheists are already familiar with most of the information contained therein. Additionally, it's quite short, and the narrator lacks the commanding voice and magnetic personality of other documentary stars.",1161993600,11,2562,4.992974238875878
2454928,3,B000CAPZBC,"This is basically a film about a guy who has lost his faith, has educated himself in Christianity vs. Paganism 101 and the apparent similarity (i.e. borrowing, stealing, whatever) of Jesus to the pagan myths of the cultures in which it embedded itself and decided to make a film about it, attempting to pass it off as an accurate historical record.  There is a sense of bitterness attendant with it which is apparent in his cynical little digs at the faith and those who profess belief in it.  Then again, there are many out there who feel as he does.

The first twenty minutes are stunning (and quite humorous), especially when the list of pagan gods/figures rolls on and their similarities to Jesus are brought out in an onslaught of information.  This is where the film is most effective as it is revelatory and eye opening.

His choice of scholars/characters (e.g. Robert Price, Richard Dawkins sided with quotes from goofy Christian fundies, e.g. Jerry Falwell, and naive Christians) is one-sided and any attempt at a balanced film is lopsided; of course,it's pretty clear up front what the film maker is attempting to say and objectivity isn't one of them.

He falls prey to certain simplistic arguments that are passed around in critical circles, taking them as absolutes, even though they are simplified aphorisms that have been filtered down from the ivory towers of academia to the masses.  For example, he narrates:

""Paul doesn't believe that Jesus was ever a human being. He's not even aware of the idea.""

This is a fallacious argument, an argument from silence.  Just because it seems Paul does not make mention of a ""human"" Jesus (he gives no indication that Jesus is not human) does not mean he is not aware of the idea.  That is like taking the words of the Bible to the opposite extreme that fundamentalists take it.

What this does is make Paul sound as if he is preaching just another pagan deity, which, of course, is the point the director is trying to make.  But if both sides are studied in some depth the shallowness of this quote becomes clear.  But the statement is pithy enough, and simple enough, that it can become a sound byte for those who seek to discredit Paul and, by extension, Christianity as a whole.

The music (kind of a techno/electronica thing), the editing and the overall pace of the film is slick, though there's a certain smugness of the narrator/director that is a bit disconcerting at times.  But it's his film.  It's worth watching though it ultimately says little that hasn't already been said.  Still a brave document that would have been unheard of not too long ago.

His pseudo-documentary ""Nothing So Strange"" about the murder of Bill Gates and the hysteria of conspiracy theories (a la JFK) is an interesting watch as well.  Hopefully we'll hear more from him in the future.",1161993600,9,2830,4.748466257668712
2454929,3,B000CAPZBC,"The author/editor does a good job for the first 80% of the movie.  The title describes that part well.

Then, in the last 20%, which should have been a climax, a denouement, and a conclusion, it swerves violently into the land of autobiography.

In creative writing, the last words of the sentence set the tone of the entire sentence.  (""In creative writing, the tone of a sentence is determined by the words that come last."")  It's the same in cinema, where the last tiny moment of a movie sets how we evaluate, summarize, and remember the movie.

In this documentary, the author's own conflict is not nearly as important as the first 80% of the movie, and in using his story to punctuate the sentence, the story seems like a personal spat, only the size of a few men.

This is a great documentary, as long as you skip the last 20%, which serves only to drag it down into the realm of the mundane.",1161907200,6,898,4.406060606060606
2454930,3,B000CAPZBC,"I came across this movie thanks to Amazon's sometimes spotty suggestions.  So after reading some of the reviews I plunked down twenty bucks and decided to take a look.

As a fellow recovering Christian and an ""out of the closet"" Atheist, I found a lot of the ideas represented in the movie was material that I had already become familiar with in one way or another.

As an example, the movie goes into some detail about other ""Christ-like"" figures that were around before, during and after the supposed timeframe of the life of Jesus.  However, the impact of that section of the movie could really have benefited from an actual comparison of some of the other known Sons of God.  They mention Mithras, Osiris and Dionysus but don't actually talk about any of them.  A brief ""comparison"" of Jesus, Osiris, Mithras, and Dionysus would have made a HUGE impact on anyone viewing this film from a religious stand point.  As it stands, the movie touches on a subject that could have nailed a home-run and settles for a bunt.

Also, the movie starts off with 6 minutes dedicated to the Christ story, which kind of sets you up for a coming section where the film will show how all these things are borrowed from other faiths that are considered ""false"" by Christians which never really comes.

The extended interviews, as well as the commentary track featuring Richard Dawkins, are worth a couple listens and there is plenty of bonus material included to make up for a fairly short documentary.  But the ""running length"" is a deceiving as that includes the Movie, the Commentary tracks, and the bonus material.

Overall, The God who Wasn't There doesn't go far enough to make an impact on someone who is on the fence, but it's a great movie for those on the Atheist side of the fence.  I liked it, but it could have been a LOT better.",1161734400,11,1826,4.601851851851852
2454931,3,B000CAPZBC,"Brian Flemming has made an interesting and entertaining documentary film that explores important issues, but its effectiveness is undermined by his narrow view of the questions and some errors of fact and logic.

He makes the common mistake of assuming that the Bible, and particularly the New Testament, must be taken literally or rejected. Some theologians, notably John Shelby Spong, speak of a different approach, of taking the writings ""seriously, but not literally."" Flemming never demonstrates any understanding that the question need not be either/or.

It is true that the gospels are heavily mythologized, and that there are probably only a few echoes of the earthly life of Jesus reflected in them. It doesn't follow from that, as Flemming believes, that a historical Jesus didn't exist.

He seems to base some of his conclusions about the purported ignorance of modern Christians on scant evidence. After showing two or three brief interviews in which believers only have a vague idea of how Christianity spread, he concludes that Christians, as a group, just don't know. That may be true or may not, but he doesn't prove the case.

The documentary is weakened by some factual errors and faulty reasoning. Among the more important ones:

* He says, correctly, that Mark was the first gospel to be written, and then incorrectly that the other three are derived from Mark. Only Matthew and Luke use Marcan material in their accounts. John is from a completely different strand of tradition. For a documentarian to make such a basic error throws his more sophisticated analysis into doubt.

* He claims that Paul ""does not know"" of the events of Jesus's earthly life, based on the fact the Paul doesn't mention those events in his epistles. That does not logically follow. Given that Paul was writing to groups of Christians in various parts of the world, mostly to address specific issues they were dealing with at the time, it may simply be that they already knew the story and didn't need it repeated.

* He believes the book of Hebrews is one of Paul's letters. It is not. Again, this suggests a lack of rigor in his research.

There are parts of the film that are far more effective. He ably demonstrates the intolerance and ignorance of the religious right. Then again, it's an easy target. He's completely right, but the point is completely obvious (to anyone who isn't part of he religious right, anyway, and they won't be persuaded.) He also does a good job of showing the delusions of those who believe Armageddon is near and interpret current events as fulfillment of Bible prophecy. But again, that's fish in a barrel.

But then he goes right off the rails to criticize moderate Christianity for not taking the Bible literally in all ways, as the fundamentalists do.  This again betrays his binary thinking, that it is all literally true or else worthless. Many contemporary theologians would say the Bible is the record of primitive human beings trying to understand God, rather than the inerrant word of God. Flemming doesn't address that idea at all.

Flemming makes a good case against fundamentalism, and in this time where fundamentalists have unprecedented and dangerous influence over American politics, that's important. But he ultimately fails to prove much of anything else, so the value of the film is limited.

Flemming once was a fundamentalist, and I suspect that is the source of his either/or approach. Sadly, that means he is still a fundamentalist, because he still has not learned any other way to think.",1160956800,17,3544,4.947811447811448

Sadly, most ""scholarship"" on this issue has sadly been anything *but* scholarly.  I guess it's natural - the topic itself selects towards those who have a keen interest in the subject, and naturally most of those are believers, who by definition are simply not objective about it.  It is refreshing to see a different, actually objective approach to the topic.

On the same note, I would love to see the same approach applied to other similar historical figures - what for instance do we and don't we know about Mohammed, Confucious, Buddha, and others (including mythologized political figures, such as Mao Zedong).

A lot of the basic raw material is there (such as ""Why I am not a Muslim"", by Ibn Warraq or ""Mao"" by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday); it would be great to see other documentary filmakers turn it compeling, objective documentaries in the same spirit as TGTWT.",1159228800,13,1010,4.815028901734104

Religion, and its sway over the American public has become more and more of alarming trend over the past half-century, particularly as we continue to break down the walls of separation and church and state so forcefully outlined by the constitutional framers. This DVD just begins to outline the problems with doctrinal christianity, its origins and its claims , particularly in light of current events. Albeit, short, its cogent analysis begins to raise questions that only further research would begin to answer. Of course, a skeptical , inquisitive mindset is necessary to embark on this journey; those who are comfortable with their level of indoctrination, and are incapable or unwilling to begin to ask those queries should stay away.

In an age of reason, scientific advance we should hold it incumbent upon ourselves to challenge our ""beliefs"" our motives and our need for embracing life philosophies that are so often easily disproved, explained or shown to be remnants of primitive animistic religions and superstitious belief systems. One only read "" The Third Chimpanzee"" by Jared Diamond to scratch the surface of what cultural anthropology can tell us viz the origins of religion.

More and more light is being shed on the nebulous and obstreperous origins of Christianity, its mythos and its key players. Ignorance of characters such as Dionysus, Mithra, Krishna, Horus, Ieusus only lends itself further to blind faith.

So , all in all, relax, open your mind, and enjoy this lighthearted introduction to a world of inquiry, a world without blind lemming like faith... and really begin to the ask the important questions of yourself of Who? What? Where? and Why?...",1156032000,13,1776,5.096219931271477

I am a former Christian, so I know exactly how I would have felt watching this movie as a believer.

It's a shame that if the facts were just laid out there, instead of having silly cartoons and background music, the points made in the movie would be much stronger.

I did not realize prior to seeing this documentary how many parallels there are between the story of Jesus and other mythical figures from history. This is one of the strongest pieces of evidence against Christianity, and unfortunately most (if not all) Christians who watch this will have pressed the stop button before they hear it.

Many of these similarities between Jesus and other figures such as Krisha or Mithras, for example, are unfortunately uncanny.

2454941,3,B000CAPZBC,"One of the claims of ""The God Who Wasn't There"" is that it will do to religion what Bowling For Columbine and Super Size Me did to their respective genres. This is a misleading advertisement, however. Instead of an expose in religion in general, director Brian Flemming has focused this documentary solely on fundamentalist Christianity. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you're going to claim that your film will change the face of religion, shouldn't you include ALL religions or at least a representative sample?

That is not the case here. There is never a cross-examination of Islamic, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, or any other faith other than Christianity.

It's obvious that the film is a vehicle for Flemming's disgust with Christianity. This doesn't ruin the film, but it does make it one-sided. Flemming presents several facts, figures, and theories that are interesting and insightful, but if you've done any research into Christianity you probably know already. Here's a few examples: the appearance in the apostle Paul's writings that he didn't know Jesus was a real person, the gap in years between Jesus' death and the writing of the Gospels, how Chrisitianity was really spread after Jesus' death, what the Bible considers to be an unforgivable sin and the contradiction to free will, the similarity between Jesus and other mythical gods and saviors in ancient history, etc.

What really hurts this documentary is its one-sided argument. Flemming rarely if ever presents information that contradicts his thesis, that Jesus never really existed. The information he presents is fine and mostly stands on its own, but if you really want to have a persuasive argument, you must consider and refute the opposing side. Flemming never does this. Had he considered opposing arguments and had solid refutations, this film would be a hundred times stronger.

Flemming's one-sidedness hit its peak when he interviews the principal for the Christian school he used to attend as a child. The interview was good but could've been better if Flemming had used tact in asking his questions instead of trying to overpower the principal with his own beliefs and questions.

On the positive side, the doc was filmed very well and the information was presented in ways that keep the viewer entertained. There are several parts that are scary/funny/sad, like when he does an interview with a guy that has a website called Rapture Letters in which people can put ""unsaved"" loved ones on an emailing list, and when the apocalypse comes, they will be sent an email telling them what has happened and how they can save themselves.

2454946,5,B000CAPZBC,"I found this DVD both richly entertaining and extremely informative. Having been an atheist myself for over thirty years now, I considered myself knowledgeable on the subject matter of this DVD. Yet I was surprised - and quite delighted - by how much new insight I gained from this superb documentary.

For example, I did not previously realize that the Pauline Epistles make no reference at all to the virgin birth, to Mary and Joseph, to Bethlehem, to Herod, to *any* words allegedly spoken by Jesus, to anything pertaining to Jesus' earthly ministry, nor to any of the miracles Jesus supposedly performed. Paul mentions only the cruci-""fiction,"" resurrection and ascension, tales handed down to Christianity from older mythologies, as Brian Flemming powerfully demonstrates here.

Better than any other source I've seen, this DVD explains how the time-gap between Jesus' alleged death and the writing of the Gospels lends credibility to the assertion that Jesus probably never existed. Moreover, even if Jesus did exist, the stories surrounding him, such as the slaughter of the innocents, have no historical corroboration and therefore lead an objective viewer of this DVD to conclude that the Gospel accounts couldn't possibly be true (whether or not Jesus existed).

This documentary was also extremely funny where appropriate. When Brian Flemming summarized the highlights of Jesus' career, the footage running in the background - along with Flemming's casual manner of speaking - left me laughing more boisterously than I have since watching the original Monty Python episodes. What was especially funny was that Flemming's summary of the Gospels was perfectly on-target and did not distort scripture in any way. The DVD therefore succeeded in showing that the Bible, when viewed objectively, is truly laughable.

I also thoroughly enjoyed this DVD because I got to see video of individuals whose writings I have admired for years, such as Bob Price, Sam Harris, and Richard Carrier. People sometimes come across differently on camera than they do in print. But all of the extended interviews on the DVD showcased the intellect of these scholars as impressively as their books.

The physical production and packaging of this DVD are equivalent to anything marketed by Sony Pictures or Warner Brothers. I was expecting to receive a one-off DVD with an adhesive label. But what I received was a highly professional product in every sense of the word. My enthusiastic compliments to Brian Flemming and to everyone who participated in this important project.

2454947,4,B000CAPZBC,"For a person who hasn't heard of the concept of Jesus being a work of fiction, this is a wonderful introduction and defense. However, when you've already looked into the idea, it's repetiton. Albeit entertaining repetition. Many will be amazed at the fact of a completely unfogivable sin (denial of the holy spirit.)",1147132800,17,316,4.981132075471698
2454948,1,B000CAPZBC,"Simly put I was completely mortified at the horrendous production that this movie is. Seriously with all the hype you would expect something better than a 12 year old could produce.

That said, the movie really lacks substance. I mean anyone can create a movie and say God dosent exist because we don't see him but the producer does nothing in the way of facts to back it up.

The producer goes on to criticize the Catholic Religion in an unsubstantiated way by asking passers by what or who they though God was. The people answered in sometimes simple and naive ways but you do get the feeling that subjects are being asked the question without any prior orientation or without context, just random questions to randome people. Quite unintelligent!

I expected to see serious arguements regarding God with facts, interviews with scholars and other such hard evidence but none of this was the case. Furthermore the movie was extremely short and ended in abrupt way leaving me with a big question mark over my head.

Do not waste your money.",1146873600,19,1040,4.7292817679558015
2454949,3,B000CAPZBC,"The DVD was not bad, but seemed to lack a lot in the way of material. The premise of his arguement was extremely simple and left the viewer wanting some more. Sam Harris, author of ""The End of Faith"", has some interesting things to say. Otherwise, it was the documentary was a very narrow view on a very complex subject. Although, I would not rave about the documentary, it is worth while renting. The fellow doing the documentary, Brian Flemming, did touch on some interesting inconsistencies in the New Testament and a couple other ideas which make it worth watching.

Too bad, because this film could've been so much better in raising public awareness of the Bible's numberless textual/historical issues.  The first 30 minutes were often quite amusing and interesting, though what pretense of objectivity there was quickly wore thin.  Maybe if the director were to come back in about 20 years after growing up more, he could remake this film and finally do it right.",1146268800,10,639,5.434343434343434
2454952,4,B000CAPZBC,"I am an admitted agnostic with atheistic leanings. This film covers more than whether Christ existed but looks at the beliefs held by Christians about Christ and other events that take place in the Bible. I thought the topic presented many points of interest that beg for further research on the issue. And therein lies my problems with the film - for all the discussion about hero creation stories, I felt that it would have better served the film to draw out more of the parallel lines between many of the Greco/Roman, mythical heroes of the period. By drawing these connections a little more readily, it would have made the impact of the interviewees carry a heavier weight.

While many reviewers discuss the non-Christ theories, I personally did not feel the heavy weight of the question about whether Christ existed but rather gathered that the information is far from conclusive on the subject. Yes, it begs the question, but does not go the extent of beating you over the head with the idea that Christ did not exist.

Unfortunately, I did not walk away with more than an impression of a person's questions about Christianity, the problems with some points of Christian beliefs and how it lead him to walk away from the religion. The story was somewhat parallel to my own experienes and presented many of the oddities, logical issues, and bizarre supernatural beliefs held by many Christians.

I also felt that there was an understated appreciation for open discussion of religion within the film. It would have been more to my liking had they interviewed a broader array of historians and theologians.

The information presented in this film may be easily dismissed by some Christians. Two of the reasons I see are most common are:

Faith - Because they believe and/or possibly refuse to question or be open to other ideas around the Christ stories. This is touched on in the film a bit but the point was somewhat muddled.

Sectarian variation - this film uses clips and audio from some of the more extreme, fundamentalist Christian sects. It could be dismissed as not applying to themselves or bearing no merit for further examinination the topic. Yet those who would fall under this category should note that this is what many of us see as the reality of the faith.

This film is by far, not the end-all, be-all argument against Christianity. But it does bring more concepts to the table that a person of faith should consider or research in developing, setting or sustaining their own faith.

Aside from the philosophical aspects of the film, it was well shot and was rich with colors. The use of music gets a little distracting at points but does not override the thesis. In one interview, the lighting appears to be a little off and the subject interview is a bit darker. Otherwise, for an independent film, it was well-done. I'm hoping for a part two that covers the subject in further detail. It is definitely a discussion piece to be debated.",1145836800,14,2958,4.763671875
2454953,5,B000CAPZBC,"Like a breath of fresh air.  In the midst of our predominately perverse Christian culture, this movie was refreshing and inspiring.  Common sense does exist in America!!!  A certain must-see.",1145750400,16,191,5.3
2454954,3,B000CAPZBC,"I liked the movie, but like others here commented it was too short for a documentary. Also I agree with the comments that the director had a vendeta, specially with the poor guy who's the principal at his former Christian school. The information he intorduces is very basic and does not elaborate on it much. We know the Jesus Story and he spends too much time on that part! And the pagan gods segment, which might be new info to viewers, is very brief. I think it was just OK. I made me feel that this person has anger and felt duped by Christianity and that is not everyone's experice. Just as there is eveidence against a historicla JC there is al evidence for him, so this is a very subjective point of view.

The tenents and beliefs of the Christian faith stand strongly, beyond the mythos of the virgin birth and resurection claims. And believe me, I'm far from fundamentalist. Sometimes anger and bitternes will blind us to the greater spiritual truth. But overall good effort.",1145577600,8,984,4.559322033898305
2454955,4,B000CAPZBC,"So says Brian Flemming, former fundamentalist Christian, in this brave new film. In it, Fleming examines the ""Jesus myth"" and finds it exactly that - a myth. This, he uses as a vehicle to call the whole of Christianity (based, as it is, on this myth) into question.

The first third of the film is devoted to exploring the ""history of Jesus"" the church doesn't highlight. From the fact that we have NO first-hand witnesses to Jesus's existence to the fact that just about all Jesus's attributes were borrowed from earlier ""Christs,"" we get a pretty thorough treatment on this score. No believer in Jesus the ""Christ"" will be left untouched here.

From here, we explore the nature of Christianity today. We are treated to scenes (used without Gibson's permission) from the ""Passion of the Christ"" - what Fleming terms ""The Smashin' of the Christ"" - to question what kind of religion makes a blood-and-guts movie a best seller! Further, we are treated to some of the finer points of the old testament's ""morality"" and even an explosive interview with Fleming's former Bible-based grade-school teacher.

Along the way, we run into such scholars as the biblical scholar Robert M. Price, ""End of Faith"" author Sam Harris, historian Richard Carrier, and (in the special features) zoologist Richard Dawkins. While this film isn't the most in-depth exploration of Christianity (it is, after all, about an hour), it is intellectually ""action packed,"" and offers the theist and atheist (the former moreso than the latter)something to mull over.

Fleming made most of this film himself, using computer graphics, self-conducted interviews, movie footage, and his own narration. If it is a good film intellectually, it is as much so aesthetically. The graphics are great, the very conversation-like narration works well, and the bold music is a perfect fit with the mood of the film.

There are only certain complaints I have to do with the fact that sometimes, I feel Fleming is more rhetorical than reasoned (in the vein of Farenheit 9/11). But I cannot get into too many of those nit-picky details without divulging a good amount of the film's content. I took off only a star for some of this becuase - after all - it is fun for us atheists to see other atheists rhetoricize against Christians (as Christians are all too happy to return the favor)!

Must see for anyone concerned with religion.",1145404800,24,2384,4.917910447761194
2454956,2,B000CAPZBC,"Don't waste your money!  This is a film by a disgrutled Christian Fundamentalist.  He's gone from one fringe group to another.  He didn't have one theologian in his group of ""experts"" and I use that term loosely.  The biblical quotes cited in the movie were completely out of context. Example:  a quote from a parable Jesus taught, was used as his own words.  It actually came from an old story that was told before Jesus' time.  Also, the premise that Jesus is God is only held by catholics and fundamentalist Christians.  Jesus never proclaimed to be God.  This video has been sucessfully hyped and promoted but does not live up to any of it.  I paid the price because I thought I would learn something - I was wrong.",1145232000,6,719,4.503875968992248
2454957,5,B000CAPZBC,"I must admit, I love reviewing books and films about what H.L. Mencken might have called ""heaving dead cats into sanctuaries*."" For one thing, one of Mencken's own horse-laughs almost always lies in wait at the bottom of their Amazon pages. The page for Brian Flemming's ""The God Who Wasn't There"" is no exception. This time around, it's what I like to call ""shy evidence"": It never fails to amuse this reviewer when Christians boast about a ""massive body of evidence"" regarding the existence of Jesus and yet never seem able to produce this massive body of evidence. There is a massive body of refuted evidence (apology, historicization, and propaganda) regarding the chronicity of the Jesus figure, to be sure, in the sense that the evidentiary data and arguments formed around it have failed to satisfy the basic tenets of academia as well as to pass logical muster---but a ""massive body of [valid] evidence""? We're still waiting. Our minds are open. Produce your god, and we shall bow down to him; that's a promise.

But with each good horse-laugh often comes a twinge of annoyance. True to form, the first Christian review of this documentary I could find makes an ad hominem attack against an informational source in the narrative, but fails to even speak to the arguments of the narrative themselves, let alone refute them. Is anyone still buying this tack? (if person bad, person wrong) I would have thought card-carrying members of the Christian Apology Club would have retired it by now. In truth, for the documentary's limited scope, its points are quite succinct and well made; and while there is much more to be said regarding the evils of organized religion, this documentary provides a wonderful jumping off point for truth seekers.

Indeed, viewers will miss the entire point of the documentary if expecting an airtight comprehensive proof of Jesus Christ as fiction rather than fact that not even Pat Robertson could fail to laud; such would be beyond the scope of any documentary. In the same way that physicians once ran the gamut in medical knowledge and practice, but today need to specialize due to the exponentially increasing body of medical science and application; authors, pundits, and documentary filmmakers must wage their wars on one focused front at a time in the modern day, avoiding the temptation to speak to points beyond the scope of their project. Some reviewers of this documentary have claimed that this is a weakness. I say otherwise. After all, what better way to entice viewers to do further, hopefully objective research on their own than to only reference and locate topics such as the astrotheological roots of religion and the phenomenon of moderate Christianity, leaving the viewers' interest exquisitely piqued? Besides, how reasonable is it to expect a filmmaker to pack that kind of information into a single documentary? As viewers will miss the point if expecting an airtight comprehensive proof beyond all doubt, reviewers hold the filmmaker to an unreasonable standard if expecting the documentary to take the place of tens of thousands of pages of hardcore scholarship. The filmmaker correctly, even expertly limits his content to the scope of the project and, in so doing, relies on the integrity of his reviewers to limit their critiques to that scope.

What this documentary offers is the provocation of thought upon a limited few subtopics regarding the question of whether Jesus Christ ever actually existed, presented in a well-organized and -rounded fashion which, while making no bones about where the filmmaker stands, still gives the viewer plenty of room to call the evidence and arguments presented to the tribunal of her or his own intellectual discernment, reason, and good sense---bite-size pieces of ""things that make you go, `hmmm...'"" to act as a jumping off point from which the truth seeker may launch into further objective research, rather than engaging in the wholesale adoption of belief systems formulated by others. Thus, for example, a zoologist---well trained in critical thought and the inductions of the scientific method---being interviewed regarding his thoughts on the historicity of Jesus Christ should not raise a red flag in the viewer's mind at all. That there are indeed glaring historical inaccuracies surrounding the Jesus account is a fact that remains wholly unaffected by the nature of the scholarship of the person proclaiming such historical inaccuracies, for the modern layperson, child of the Information Age, is increasingly well equipped to affirm or deny these inaccuracies on her or his own. Verily, this reviewer says unto you, if this film with its interviewees provoked afterthought in the viewer, then it has frankly done its job. If it has inspired serious discussion on the film's subject matter, all the better. If it has transcended its subject matter, has tickled the cinephile, and stands as a representative piece of documentary film art**...well that's the icing on the cake, isn't it?---the cat's meow, as it were, as she is heaved by a wild-eyed and smiling Mencken into a solemn sanctuary full of nodding sheep, hiding secret doubt and holy fear. In this reviewer's opinion, Brian Flemming is 3 for 3.

These issues won't be dealt with overnight, and they won't be dealt with in a single documentary or book, nor even by a single filmmaker or author. Don't judge this documentary by what isn't there but by what is. Put simply, good social commentary is whatever opens dialogue and stimulates discussion, and this documentary does both, in spades. As we are all affected in one way or another by Christianity, this documentary is for everyone. No matter what you believe and no matter why you believe it, give ""The God Who Wasn't There"" an honest viewing with a truly open, objective mind. I dare you. If your beliefs are worthy of you, then they can surely stand up to the scrutiny.

* ""The liberation of the human mind has never been furthered by dunderheads; it has been furthered by gay fellows who heaved dead cats into sanctuaries and then went roistering down the highways of the world, proving to all men that doubt, after all, was safe---that the god in the sanctuary was finite in his power and hence a fraud. One horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms. It is not only more effective; it is also vastly more intelligent."" --H.L. Mencken

2454958,5,B000CAPZBC,"This is a great informative film.  However, please don't see it if you're a fundamentalist Christian easily offended by challenges to your dogma.  You'll hate it.  Of course, one of the biggest criticisms the movie puts forth is that many Christians cannot tolerate ideas counter to what they accept as truth even if presented as theory.  In other words, Christianity works because people refuse to hear anything that might be construed as questionable.  Yes, many hardcore Christians are blissfully ignorant.  More power to them, I guess.

I'm not Christian so that wasn't a problem for me.  And I really don't care if someone is Christian because that's their choice.  But I have to admit that this doc raises many important questions, presents many important ideas.  Personally, I think Christians should see it.  But it would just make them uncomfortable or angry, so never mind.  For the rest of us though, it gives you something to think about.

The thing I liked best about the film is that is not mean-spirited.  It would be easy to take the low road, but the film, while clearly having a point-of-view, does not particularly attack Christianity.  It merely showcases many compelling arguments.  And the maker clearly has a strong background in the Christian faith, which helps because he actually knows what he's talking about.  Some people might not agree with his findings, but you can't argue with his actual quotes from the Bible and even his history which is taken directly from accepted church teachings.  Yet for such a strong faith, it's amazing how quickly people get hostile when challenged.

I found it fascinating.",1144886400,28,1635,4.988888888888889
2454959,4,B000CAPZBC,"Some of the atheist reviewers who are disappointed by the brevity of this documentary and its attention to the topic of Christ ahistoricity would better appreciate that it was produced to provide an introduction and encouragement to the viewer to research extraordinary claims for oneself.  Considering apparent budget constraints, Brian Flemming brings a wealth of talent and production experience to fashion an entertaining if perhaps overly personalized audio/visual outcome that serves just this -- an engrossing introduction.  But even as the most perfunctory gloss to advance a remarkable unmainstream-like theory, it is marred by glaring incompletion.

At the very beginning in of the presentation, the producer hints at a critical underpinning of mythic Christianity  but ultimately fails to inform the viewer of its total import.  Terra-centric dogma embraced by the Church and challenged by Galileo at great personal risk was just a small component of a vast astrotheological almost universal understanding  of cosmic reality that served as a critical component to the foundation of Christianity and its Jesus myth.  Flemming skillfully informs the viewer of a long preceding nearly global tradition of the ""rising and dying godmen"",  but seems content to  keep one ignorant of their sun god status with astrological contexts that was at the heart of  the arguments posed by so many of this producer's intellectual antecedents.  It might interest readers and viewers alike to know that Christ mythicist theory has a very distinguished tradition that dates back to the enlightenment of the eighteenth century, precisely at a time when the parameters of civic tolerance would begin to allow for such notions.  Aside from the emphasis on the dearth of extra-Christian and unapologetic evidences for Christ's existence, attention to astrotheological precepts and their influence on the foundations of almost all known religions, both still existing and defunct, was the cornerstone of authors' arguments advanced in declaration of the mythic Jesus of Nazareth.  This remained so until the 1920s or so, when a new fervor of apology both moderate and fundamentalist generally swept western publishing houses of any topics that might run contrary to Christian orthodoxy.

What is most inexplicable about this production is the failure of the producer to acknowledge his fellow Californian who has with great integrity and almost infinite research, best resurrected (no pun intended) a nearly forgotten  intellectual tradition to great esteem and hopefully respectability.  Richard Carrier is perhaps the most eminent current atheist essayist, but he only arrived to a completely mythicist opinion relatively recently, as is apparent by his older essay on Earl Doherty's website.  This begs the question why would the producer seek to interview someone whose opinions on the subject are so virginal over Acharya S, whose nearly decade of contributions in this arena are impeccable and popularly known?  Just the most superficial glances at her website reveal that study of her 2 books and several essays have been a force of liberation and psychological release for many questioning ex-Christians, and probably more so than  Carrier could affect in his wildest dreams.

At the conclusion of his interview with Earl Doherty, Flemming  expresses his desire that Christ mythicist theory may one day assume some respectability as well as acknowledged credibility in the halls of academia.  Does he not appreciate that he undermines that very goal if he, presumably with deliberation, ignores his topical forebears and ignores any colleagues with the same or similar pursuits?",1144886400,9,3673,5.486678507992895

Are you all giving this much credit to a ""film maker"" with arguments that are used by the average Joe? So he doesn't think Jesus is real and he found liberal theologians to back up what he thinks. Where were the conservative theologians? Where was Ravi Zachrias and Albert Mohler? Be your own academic. If Jesus didn't exist, I guess we're all off the hook and no one is accountable for anything.

2454962,1,B000CAPZBC,"I really wanted to be impressed by this movie.  It had apparently won some critical acclaim and had received generally favorable reviews on Amazon.  Moreover, having been raised a Christian, I have been critically examining Christianity through various books and tapes for a couple of years now, and was looking forward to an entertaining documentary that took a firm stand against Christianity (intending to contrast it with other materials that support Christianity.)

Well, this documentary was a great disappointment.  It does not even begin to advance the ball one way or the other.  It's not even entertaining.  Imagine watching a home movie thrown together by an angry adolescent who was kicked out of a Christian high school for smoking pot and wants to get back at the principal by making a documentary trashing Christianity and, especially, Christians.  That's about the level of discourse you will find in this movie.

As a hint to how bad this movie is, it begins by interviewing a number of Christians and marveling at how happy they all are.  Then the narrator ominously states, ""But not all Christians are happy.""  It then shows us pictures of four or five ""unhappy Christians"", the first of whom is . . . Charles Manson!  At that point (about 1 minute into the film), the movie lost any credibility.  And, in all honestly, it never gets much better.

The only people who could possibly enjoy this movie are folks who aready believe all Christians are idiots or hypocrites.  If you're one of those, by all means rent the video, pop it in your DVD player, and watch it while downing a couple of beers.  But if you are instead interested in critical examination of Christianity and how and why various beliefs developed, surf over the The Learning Company's website and buy some really excellent documentaries on Christ and Christianity. That way you can learn something and be entertained at the same time.",1144627200,13,1920,4.900928792569659
2454963,5,B000CAPZBC,"This is one of the most important movies ever made, in my opinion. For thousands of years there has been a fundamental and growing doubt about the validity of religions such as Christianity. Christianity has gotten a free ride for the most part, because those who question Christianity have tended to be quiet about it. Quiet as they are, the number of atheists and agnostics in the world has grown dramatically.

Well, no more. This well-produced and scholarly documentary is an excellent fusion of the main tenets of rational thought, as well as a great primer for anyone not sure what to think about the story of Jesus, et al. The information is presented in an intelligent and entertaining way. This a movie to show your family, your co-workers, and your friends. The discussions that follow will enrich everyone, and possibly help save the planet from another millenia of brutal superstition.

Even better still, the features included with the documentary are incredible. Authors such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris are interviewed and allowed to expand on the important work they are doing. It is like having a personal conversation with some of the greatest modern rationalists in your own living room.

I highly recommend this Documentary to anyone with an open mind. Anyone who tries to label this Documentary as mere propaganda has not seen it. If you want to see propaganda, try the ""passions"" of the ""christs"".",1144627200,23,1425,4.953974895397489

I have no doubt that any theists who do decide to see the movie will be questioning their faith and hopefully start to understand the logic behind what they believe and think about what they're basing their beliefs on. And if they're not, whether it's wise to just believe them with no reason to, than for just a pathway into heaven which is completely selfish.

If you're a theist, the section about the lack of knowledge about the early spread of christianity and some of the mythological tie-ins may engage your curiosity, but you won't really be running into any new ideas.

I agree with other reviewers about the interview with the head of his former christian school, in that Brian was very rude to the man and misrepresented his intent when he requested an interview.  His inclusion of this into the documentary just looks arrogant.

This DVD is interesting to say the least but it's real purpose seems to be a strike at a Christian School where Flemming was forced to believe one suffers Damnation or rewarded with Salvation, nothing else.  This is most evident at the end.

Though I would like to mention Flemming is the first person I've come across to give me the exact quote regarding homosexuality in the Bible.

Sadly it doesn't look too much into the world of literature, avoiding Biblical Historians and concentrating mainly on Authors who have written books on the modern christrian movement.

I will however give props to Flemming for the inclusion of Thievery Corporation in the credits, they are an amazing band and worth checking out.

Instead of The God Who Wasn't There, I suggest ""What the Bleep Do We Know!?"" as it explored metaphysics with an interesting twist, looking beyond just God and Jesus but at the Universe and the way it works.",1142899200,5,1192,4.734299516908212
2454970,4,B000CAPZBC,"Brian Flemming effectively illustrates the gullibility that blind faith bestows upon seemingly intelligent people. He touches upon the dangerous ""End Times"" beliefs of many Christian fundamentalists, as depicted in the disconcertingly popular ""Left Behind"" series. According to end-times precepts, Christ will only appear again on the backdrop of an Armageddon-level conflict between the forces of good and evil. Since end-timers feverishly desire the Second Coming, it is decidedly against their interest to foster world peace. It is very disturbing to realize that current foreign policy decisions of the US government are being made by a group of people who are deeply beholden to a segment of the population firmly committed to End Times and the Second Coming.

There is one common misconception in the information provided by ""The God Who Wasn't There."" The DVD says there is about a forty year gap in the history of the early Christian church, between the date of the Crucifixion (around AD 30) and the time the gospels were written (around AD 70). However, the eminent theologian and historian, Dr. Barbara Thiering, has convincingly demonstrated that the Dead Sea Scrolls provide a key to the interpretation of the earliest Greek versions of the New Testament, thus revealing a detailed history of the entire sweep of Christianity throughout the entire first century AD. In her books, ""Jesus the Man,"" ""Jesus of the Apocalypse,"" and ""The Book that Jesus Wrote,"" she documents the direct influence that Jesus himself had on the spread of Christianity because he survived the Crucifixion and directed the workings of the early Church. If Brian Flemming had included Dr. Thiering's material in this DVD,  he would have provided further historical counterpoint to the traditional Christian myths and superstitions.

We viewed ""The God Who Wasn't There"" with a group of our friends, and afterward one of them said, ""It's interesting, but it's all negative. Where's the positive approach?"" He was right. It's a hard sell to convince someone to give up their current strong religious beliefs without providing them with a stepping stone to a deeper level of spirituality. The DVD would have been strengthened by drawing out Sam Harris' personal beliefs in a contemplative practice. His book, ""The End of Faith,"" speaks to the value of meditation and contemplation. Atheism is not the only available option when traditional religious myths finally fade under the spotlight of rationalism.",1142726400,16,2488,5.293670886075949
2454971,4,B000CAPZBC,"I would recomend this documentary to any 'backslidden' christians who want to see the evidence AGAINST Jesus.

All the evidence is not on the video only. You will get to see the website addresses to check out, on the DVD.

I don't think the footage on this DVD would convince many christians otherwise. I was once a strong believer in Jesus and God, myself(20 years). And the film does have a 'propaganda' type feel to it. With any luck it will make some seek more info though. The film in noway covers all the available information concerning the Jesus Myth. I think it serves more as an appetizer. I think this is what mr Flemmings had in mind.

I liked the video, however i didn't like that it was only 53 minutes long! The extra features make up a bit for it though with the extended interviews.

I like reading Richard Carrier's essays and Sam Harris. It was good to see these guys on the vid.

The sound track is great!

I don't think Brian flemming had any intentions of showing both sides to the Jesus Myth debate in this film. Afterall, who hasn't heard the otherside at least 100 times already!

I would have loved to have seen more christian interviews, atheist interviews, more info on ancient documents(what we have and don't have). Of course, i like my information deep! I will have to wait for an other Brian Flemming film to have that :)

To all those christians out there, don't be afraid to seek truth. Ask questions and seek truth.

To 'backslidden' christians, you don't need to be in depression anymore. Watch this dvd and start to find a way out. Brian Flemming done it. This is a part of his story. Afterall, would God want you to be depressed?

In summary. I find 'The God Who Wasnt There' An Entertaining look on how easy it is for religion to ruin the lives of billions of people.",1142640000,10,1806,4.445454545454545
2454972,3,B000CAPZBC,"I am a born-again Christian and work for a Christian newspaper.

And I think that every Christian should see this film.

It is imperative that we, as believers, expose ourselves to competing and alternate beliefs. Some members of my own church likely will disagree with me, but I believe that the truth stands up to all scrutiny.

Brian Fleming gives an honest, heart-wrenching look at his own belief system. (We all believe in something, whether it's God or not. And we all worship something, whether it's God, possessions or science.)

And he makes some wonderful points. First of all, we've done a lousy job of educating people about Christian history after the life of Christ. We must be more aware of our history - the good and the bad. Fleming accurately points out that a lot of people have said and done a lot of stupid things in the name of Christ (from Waco to Pat Robertson).

Fleming's statement, ""Moderate Christianity makes no sense"" absolutely blew me away. All I can say is ""Amen!""

Fleming's assertion that the apostle Paul himself denied Jesus' mortality is simply wrong. He cites Hebrews 8:4 as proof of this: ""If Jesus had been on Earth ...""

You'll have a hard time finding a version of the Bible that uses the word ""had"" in this verse. Most use the word ""were,"" and the context tells us that the meaning is more along the lines of: ""If Jesus were on the earth right now ...""

(And if you want to quote Paul, you really shouldn't use the book of Hebrews. In all likelihood, Paul didn't write it. Some scholars have attributed it to Barnabas or Apollos.)

Fleming also stacks the deck against Christianity in his choice of sources. For the cause of atheism he includes interviews with religion scholars and other academics.

Representing Christianity, he uses a rather combative interview with the headmaster of the Christian school he attended and an interview with a contractor who has set up a Web site to send e-mails to people ""after the Rapture."" Plus he throws in some ""on-the-street"" interviews with Christians that come across much like the ""Jaywalking"" segments on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

It's also obvious that Fleming's understanding of the ""unforgivable sin"" hasn't matured much since his days in the pews of his Christian primary school. Many scholars believe that ""blasphemy against the Holy Spirit"" is the willful denying of the Spirit's power when you know it to be the work of God. I'm not sure about that, but I know it's not something you can do by accident.

When Fleming describes his experiences at the Christian school, he's describing the same kind of doubt that all of us go through as believers. Questioning our beliefs is important to our spiritual formation. It bothers me that he didn't seem to have anyone to hear his concerns and discuss his questions.

Despite his ""attempted blasphemy"" at the end of the film (denying the Holy Spirit on camera) I believe that Fleming isn't beyond saving.

Truth is, our faith needs more people like him - people of talent and conviction who have confronted their beliefs (or lack thereof) and have something to say.",1142553600,14,3112,4.770949720670391

2454974,4,B000CAPZBC,"The God Who Wasnt There: DVD

This documentary film pursues two not very compatible themes. For one, the director examines the history of the Bible, especially the New Testament, for two the author tries to show the fruits of Christianity as evil.

Most thinking people will acknowledge that Christians have done many admirable deeds, as well as much evil, the Inquisition, the Crusades, wars over whether God is one or three. But, this is not relevant to whether the Gospel stories are true or false.

Brian Flemming's review of the New Testament is standard scholarship of the first century. There is a forty year gap between the time of Pontius Pilate, when Jesus was supposedly executed, and Mark, the oldest Gospel. In that gap Paul, who only saw Jesus as a spirit and in a vision created Christianity. Paul never claimed, in his letters, the recent existence of an actual person Jesus.

Flemming shows the culture of the Greco-Roman empire knew many mythical heroes with miraculous births, baptism into service, and resurrection after death. These, and Jesus, are standard folklore of the period, not history. There is no contemporary historic record of Jesus life. And, it is unlikely that ""the slaughter of the innocents"" in Bethlehem or the resurrection could have been missed by contemporary authors. The trial before the Sanhedrin, or the behavior of Pilate are utterly un-historical.

The Gospels are myth, legend, and folklore. No record of an actual historical Jesus exists. A fact which was known a hundred years ago to Albert Schweitzer when he wrote ""The Quest for the Historical Jesus."" Flemming could have gone into much further detail with his documentation of the untruth of the Gospels. I don't much care for his confrontation with the evils of Christians.",1142467200,9,1778,5.034013605442177

This is a worthy supplement to any thinking person's library. Way to go! I can't wait for the sequel in June.",1141603200,13,583,5.636363636363637
2454976,5,B000CAPZBC,"Brian Flemming, the director of this documentary, was raised as a fundamentalist Christian and attended a Cristian school.  He has since abandoned his faith, and all faith in general.  Here, he calls upon people involved in the various organizations or schools of thought that fall under the umbrella term ""freethought,"" such as the Center For Inquiry (secular humanism) and infidels.org.  For balance, he also interviews practicing Christians (found at a Billy Graham Revival in California during 2004) and for a climactic showdown of sorts, Ronald Sipus, the head of Village Christian School, where Flemming attended.  Some clearly biased reviewers, who seem not to have actually seen the film, claim ""The God Who Wasn't There"" aims to make people of faith look foolish.  Mr. Flemming's interview style is gentle and polite, and he never ridicules anyone, even out of earshot.  What he does hold up to ridicule, however, is some of the more extreme beliefs that Christian leaders foist upon their followers, such as the idea that the Rapture (a.k.a. the End of the World) is coming within our lifetimes.  Needless to say, people have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of the world, and exactly zero of them have been right, so the current Armageddon fad (exemplified by the ""Left Behind"" series of novels) richly deserves skepticism and yes, ridicule.  The true believers presented here, including Mr. Sipus, are allowed to speak, and would only seem foolish if you don't share their enthusiasm for the Son of God.  The whole point of the film, of course, is to demonstrate that Jesus, from a historical point of view, was most likely a fictional character cobbled together from much older myths of heroes and blood sacrifice.  Along the way, Mr. Flemming disects ""modern"" Christianity's preoccupation with violence, concluding with scenes (shown without permission!) from Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ.""  In a scene by scene analysis, he shows the ""bloody Jesus"" (his words) has only a few minutes without gruesome violence, and notes how this is far and away the most popular version of the Jesus myth.  The overall style of the film is quick and witty (in the vein of ""Super Size Me""), and is aided by computer graphics and clips from old films to illustrate his point.  In any event, it never comes off like an academic snooze-fest, even if some can complain it's just a little too slick.  The feature run time is merely one hour, but the extended interviews included as special features add on another hour.  Also, if you insert the disc in your computer, you're provided with links to many of the research materials that Mr. Flemming used.  Also, at the very end of the film, we find out that a thematic sequel of sorts is in the works, called ""The Beast.""  This is due for release on June 6 of this year (that's right, 6/6/06--!).  This will apparently take much of the material in this film and put it in the context of a ""conventional"" narrative film whose basic story echoes (I would guess on purpose) ""The Da Vinci Code.""  Forgive me if that sounds in any way like an ad--I don't know Mr. Flemming or am involved in any of his projects--but it all sounds too juicy to pass up.  After all, it's hard out here for a non-believer, so we take what we can get.",1140998400,21,3297,4.791519434628976
2454977,4,B000CAPZBC,"It takes a lot of courage to take on this subject matter, but Brian Flemming, (the producer), takes this on with a true sense of purpose and direction.

In short the film conducts interviews with people on the street, theologians, and skeptics. The film opens with a narrative that draws you in and races forward, never pausing for a breath of air! The music is catchy, provocative, and fun. The narrative and presentation are intelligent and thought provoking. The ending is very personal and meaningful - you don't want to leave the room at that point.

This film will probably not convert anyone - but I doubt that was Flemming's attempt. He presents an intelligent case for lack evidence for the historical Jesus and leaves you to fill in your own conclusion.

Brian Flemming has another coming out on 6/6/06 - it is about ""The Beast."" You can bet a lot of us are looking forward to that!!",1140739200,15,893,4.639240506329114

It is designed to make people use their common sense, to bring their reasoning into an area that for too long has been ignored and blindly accepted.

2454979,2,B000CAPZBC,"Frankly, this movie was a bit of a disappointment.  You know the old saying, if you shoot the king, you'd better not miss?  Well, if you want to question whether Jesus was the Christ or not, you'd better make a better case for it than this.

This movie showed some old, white men saying that Jesus really existed.  Then it showed some old, white men saying that no, he didn't.  Guys, just repeating ""did not--did too!"" over and over isn't an argument!!  Show us how to build the case!  Show us how historians marshal and sift evidence to prove whether or not somebody actually lived or was mythological.

However, the DVD wasn't a total loss.  The extra features showing extended interviews are really cool.  What made the DVD worth the purchase for me was the extended interview which mentioned the theory of ""fecund universes"" (google for it if you are into the anthropological argument and stuff like that).",1139616000,3,910,4.7025316455696204

2454981,3,B000CAPZBC,"Picking a number of stars for this movie was difficult.  What I expected to be the centerpiece - the argument that Jesus never existed - was done very badly.  There is, however, some good material that could have made a good movie without the mythicist stuff.

Watching the movie, it felt less like an exposition of a theory than an atheistic call to arms. The claim that Jesus never existed is less the core of the movie than an easy way to make believers look stupid: he specifically asks some Christians outside a Billy Graham event if they've heard of similar saviors like Attis and Osiris; they haven't. It also is in the back of one's mind in a technically unrelated interview with a school administrator, where the admin claims there's good historical evidence Jesus rose from the dead.

Unfortunately, Flemming is more the one who comes out looking stupid. He simply ignores important pieces of contrary evidence like Paul's mention of ""the Lord's brother."" One imagines a Christian documentary maker asking him if he's aware about it, as Flemming did to the people outside the Graham event.

If he had put in the effort, he could have made other people look stupid without doing the same to himself. He might, for example, have talked about contraditions in the birth naratives, found people who think the Bible is a reliable historical document, and then asked them where the Magi visited Jesus. In the end, he may not have even had to put in much effort. Jay Lenno doesn't seem to have much trouble doing it in his man on the street interviews (""The Jay Walk"").

Such interviews would have gone quite well in a movie that dropped the Jesus myth stuff and was sold soley as a rallying cry against fundamentalism. The thing is, much of the movie has nothing to do with Jesus myth claims: asking for the school admin to defend faith-based education, interviewing a guy who thinks the rapture will come in our lifetimes, and excerpting scenes from the Passion of the Christ while pointing out how it has outdone all other movies about Jesus. The last of those three hits made me think that perhaps everyone should see Gibson's movie, or at least excerpts. It forces you to consider the question: does it really make a bit of sense to think that this event is what keeps people (and only those who reach correct conclusions on religion) from eternal torture? That is, after all, what orthodox Christians believe, and scenes of Jesus' torture force one to do some thinking about it.

The movie also has great interviews with leading atheists - Richard Carrier, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Robert M. Price, and the Raving Atheist. These provide such great sound bites as ""To explain it is to refute it"" (Price on apologetics). Some of it is skillfully worked into a larger whole: Sam Harris is perhaps the best writer ever for arguing that religion is absurd; in Flemming's interview, he raises the question of what people would think if the president appealed to Zeus in talking about judicial nominations. When one reads such things in Harris' own work, one recoils at the absurdities of religion, when combined with Flemming's material on modern fundamentalists, one wants to do something about it. On the other hand, most of this material only appears in special features. There's no difficulty in going to the menu for these (unless you've got a finicky DVD player), but a better film maker would have incorporated it into the feature presentation.

If you're making a collection of modern atheist literature, it's worth getting, and I even suppose it's nice to have the views of several figures in one place. On the whole, though, its the movie that could have been.

Post Script: Looking back on this review a few months after first writing it, I regret giving the movie three stars. It got three for having some good material, but this material was put to poor use. Two stars.",1138838400,5,3889,4.758160237388724
2454982,3,B000CAPZBC,"I was eager to get this DVD after reading The Jesus Mysteries and other material on the historicity of Jesus.

There did not seem to be a clear uniting statement that the film was making. And one did get the impression the director had an axe to grind with his Christian school. On the plus side, the interviews with the subject experts were quite interesting and informative. And I commend the director for making the film at all - I just wish he would have spent another year working on the script and putting together something with more meat and less in the style of Michael Moore.",1138665600,3,722,4.6484375
2454983,4,B000CAPZBC,"Overall, I found this movie to be informative and entertaining. I even laughed out loud several times. Flemming shows that we do not have to take ourselves too seriously even when investigating an issue such as whether Jesus ever existed.  This is a very good starting point for getting into the more cerebral literature, which convincingly makes a case that Jesus was always intended by the early (Gnostic) Christians to be a mythological being. (Perhaps a more accurate statement is that this literature would seem to put the burden of proof on the Christians.) ""The Jesus Puzzle"" and ""The Jesus Mysteries"" contain much useful information ard are very readable.
When I bought the movie, I didn't notice it was only about an hour long.  But there is much more: there are extended interviews and interviews of people who don't appear in the movie.  These interviews -- especially those with Richard Carrier and Sam Harris -- are quite good, considering I doubt there were ""second takes.""  I would have preferred a longer movie that integrated more of the interview material into the movie.  And, while the movie ends in an interesting way, it does so rather abruptly.

If you are looking for a totally dispassionate analysis of the existence of Jesus, you will not find it here (although Flemming's deadpan style works well when stating what he perceives as the ""facts"").  Flemming is clearly disillusioned with Christianity, and he does not hesitate to expose hypocrisy and cruelty attributed to Christianity.  But for a previous reviewer to refer to the movie as ""gratuitous meanness"" is bizarre. Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" is what I call gratuitous violence.  The clips from ""Passion"" that Flemming includes are startling, and made me wonder how parents could actually take anyone under 16 to see that movie.  If a movie had that kind of gore and were not about Jesus, the fundamentalists would be boycotting it.

Another reviewer starts off with ""I'am a born again Christian, and yes, I know for a fact that Jesus Christ existed and IS the Son of God ....""  How can one put any weight on this person's opinion, when the entire enterprise is based on having an open mind?

A few of my favorite parts of the movie include:

1. The discussion of how early Christians reconciled the similarities between Jesus' life and the myths of early Pagan gods (Osiris-Dionysus).  In effect, the leaders claimed that the devil had ""plagiarized by anticipation.""  In other words, the devil knew that Jesus was coming and knew the details of Jesus' life and death.  So the devil then planted the myths about Pagan gods before Jesus lived. It's ridiculous but actually clever, because, as we know, the word ""pagan"" quickly became a derogatory term.  Clearly, centuries later the existence of the earlier Pagan myths and the discovery of Gnostic texts has caused some to question the very existence of Jesus.  That devil is a cagey guy!  Evidently, this is still the official story.  Nevertheless, as comes through when Christians are interviewed, church leaders never have to vocalize why Jesus seems to be virtually indistinguishable from mythical Pagan gods because modern-day Christians are blissfully ignorant about the church's beginnings, and do not seem curious about its beginnings, either.

2. The clips with the man who runs the Internet site where you can leave a letter for your non-believing loved ones (so they will know why you have suddenly disappeared during the rapture -- which will appear in the man's lifetime).  He comments that some people will have a second chance of ascending to heaven, but will do so without their heads.  Therefore, it is better to accept Jesus now so as to keep your head in the afterlife.  There's a moment where he smirks, as if he is finally, for the first time, actually listening to his ludicrous beliefs. (He could just as easily be telling Flemming about the 50 foot troll that he feeds in his backyard every morning.)  In the end, however, his beliefs appear unshakeable.

3. The interview with the headmaster at the Christian school Flemming once attended.  Some reviewers say this is a cheap shot.  Really?  This guy wants children to believe they are going to be tortured for eternity -- not 100 years or even 1000 years, but eternity -- unless they are willing to suspend disbelief in light of no evidence.  Simply on the word of adults who, as intellectuals, are unlikely to be impressive.  How is this practice at Christian schools less offensive then using the term ""crispy"" for the Branch Davidians?  It was the ludicrous beliefs of the BD adults that caused the trajedy in Waco.  Unfortunately, freedom of religion in this country is often very costly for innocent children.

The headmaster says that students are allowed to express their reservations about the Christianity, particularly the part about going to hell if one does not establish a personal relationship with Jesus.  But the skeptical student must write a paper ""proving"" his or her views.  That is, the existence of the supernatural is the default -- unless, of course, it is Zeus or Osiris or any other gods -- and grade school students must effectively prove that fairies do not exist.  Evidently, the headmaster is not familiar with Carl Sagan's quote: ""Extraodinary claims require extraordinary evidence.""

4. The interview with the ""urban legends"" couple.  The woman recounts a story that circulated on the Internet about a boy who was only a head.  His mother was too poor to afford a real body; instead his body was a bag of leaves.  But the leaves were rotting, so the boy put out an appeal for money to put fresh leaves in his bag.  This email elicited several serious responses from some concerned citizens.  (If modern people believe this sort of thing, what about highly superstitious people being ravaged by nature who lived 2000 years ago?)",1138665600,7,5878,4.917849898580122

His interview with the director of the school he once attended was painful to watch.  I'm not a christian, or any kind of theist, but he was just downright rude to that man.  I found myself in the odd position of rooting for the principal of the school.

The only reason to buy this is if you're a friend of the narrator, or have your own illogical resentment about how you were raised as a child in a religious school.",1136592000,19,986,4.326086956521739

It's hard to accept and think about if you dissagree with it, but it's well worth seeing. I think that anybody, Atheist or Theist should see this movie. Brian Flemming went to a lot of work to put together a wonderful film that is only given half the credit it deserves.

I was a Christian for 5 years, I'm now an avid Agnostic and Secular Humanist. I own a large website about religion and philosophy, and have spent probably 8-9 hours a week debating topics like the Christ-Myth theory over the past year.

For crying out loud, even atheists know that Jesus existed. They don't argue with that. They just blindly deny him as the messiah and Son of God and label him as just a man like one of us.

Scott Butcher, creator of Rapture Letter.com, belief in the ""rapture"", while delusional, shows the sincerity of this man's beliefs and his soft gentle demeanor is a refreshing presentation of the usually confrontational manner most evangelist use when confronted with resistance to their beliefs.

Richard Carrier, philosopher and historian, offers an excellent explanation of the unfriendly nature of the universe to any life form the frail design of the human body to endure even in our little part of the universe thus questioning the rational of an intelligent designer creating a universe for the living.

The late Alan Dundes, anthropologist and folklorist,  walks us through folk history and its tendency to explain what people think happened compared to what actually happened.

Sam Harris, one of the most compelling writers and speakers on the subject of religious belief,  presents an argument for intellectual honesty that any rational mind will find resonating with truth.  He bluntly exposes the dangers of the fearful reality of 7th century fundamentalist mentalities having their finger on the button.  He rebuffs the idea of ""feeling God"" and explains it's no different than ""feelings"" non-god spiritualist  experience.

Barbara & David Mikkelson, founders of Urban Legends Reference pages at snopes.com explain the power of urban legends to change stories that are repeated over and over into reflections that resonate in societies.  They expose the failing of the positive lessons of these legends by pointing out the dark side that often speaks far greater truths of the falsehoods of the intended meanings.

Robert Price, Professor of Biblical Criticism at the Center for Inquiry Institute, after inundating you with examples of Christ like life experience being told in other cultures thus exposing the god qualities of Jesus as anything but unique goes on to explain how he is a Christian atheist with his own understanding of what God is and its wholesome religious experience that does not beg historical scrutiny.  Its an explanation you just have to hear to grasp.

The commentary with Earl Doherty, author of the Jesus Puzzle, will expose the viewers to a world of Christianity that does not have the human Jesus and adds to the lack of evidence there ever was a God-Man named Jesus.

These excellent addtions as well as the great music are well worth the price of the DVD alone.  Combined, they  make for one great reason to question your God.",1135641600,41,2739,5.132882882882883
2454993,3,B000CAPZBC,"Ok, so, I saw this via BitTorrent, but hey, a review is a review. Disclaimer: I am an atheist. Summary of what this film contains: an amusing life-of-jesus rapid recap, some interesting historical data, followed by some rather unconsidered Christian-baiting. Subjectively, one gets the feel that the film-maker (who appears in a gonzo segment at the end) is still trying to convince himself.

This film takes aim squarely at the ordinary believing-but-ignorant Christian on the street. It makes no attempt to fight toe-to-toe with any heavyweight academic theologians. I suppose what I'd really like to see is the middle segment material expanded into a mini-series. There's so much that never got a mention, or got brushed across in a single sentence. The dates of the reign of Herod. The lack of Roman records. How politics and force determined the dogma of the early church. And so forth. Still, what it does say is interesting as far as it goes.

The third segment, though, strikes me as ignorant. It's thesis is: only biblical literalism is Christianity, and biblical literalism is nuts. Nuts it certainly is, but that argument's almost a straw man. It completely ignores the large majority of Christians who treat the bible as allegory and attempt to skim the good from the garbage. This is an especially odd omission seeing as the earlier segment argued quite plausibly that Paul and the early church were allegorists. If he's a Christian, why aren't the modern lot? I suppose it's harder to debunk an allegory.

Anyway, it's worth seeing, but as a prelude to doing your own detail study. You couldn't show this to a Christian and expect him to be convinced. He'd say ""show me the data"", and he'd be right to.",1133481600,46,1716,4.890034364261169
2454994,5,B000CAPZBC,"What an amazing and wonderful experience this documentary is.  Presenting the argument that Jesus never existed, Brian Flemming uses sharp graphics, intelligent interviews, historical fact, a catchy soundtrack and a fun sense of humor.

It's obvious that Mr. Flemming has come to his conclusions after a great deal of thought after slogging through all the dogma forced on him in a private Christian school.  He shares much of his reasoning through interviews with acknowledged scholars such as the late Alan Dundes, a professor of folklore at UC Berkeley.  Dr. Dundes cheerfully shows us the parallels between the story of Jesus and gods that preceeded him.  Not just parallels - the stories are identical except for the name.

The use of old and new movies is entertaining and somewhat unnerving at the same time.  The old silent films are amusing.  The clips from The Passion of The Christ emphasize how Christians found that movie to be a special moment in their lives.  Amazing considering how graphic, bloody and violent the movie is with gratuitous special effects.  The God Who Wasn't There points out the oddity of that.

There's simply not enough room here to expound on all the positive aspects of this film - the extended interviews and the slide show package extras, too.  Each person should see it and come to the same conclusions that others have.",1133481600,41,1362,4.951541850220265
2454995,1,B000CAPZBC,"It is one thing to argue that Jesus was not the son of God and did not rise from the dead, but to argue that he never lived at all is to go a bridge too far.  Its clear from watching this movie that the film maker had some very bad experiences with Christianity and decided to work through his own anger, guilt, and neurosis by inflicting this movie on the world.

Rather than present a serious debate about the existence and nature of the historic Jesus, he goes about to find the minority of serious scholars who deny that Jesus ever existed and opposes them with a collection of the most ignorent, narrowminded evangelical Christians he can find. Would it have been too much to ask to interview a serious scholar and Christian like NT Wright and let them make the case for Jesus?  For this film maker, yes it would have been because as I said above the film is more about his own neurosis and anger than any serious discussion of Jesus.  By the end of the film I found myself feeling rather sorry for him. Whatever his problems are, carrying out a Jihad against Christianity through the making of deceptive and pedantic films like this one is unlikely to help him.

For the record I am a Christian and find debates and study concerning the early church and the historic Jesus facinating even when conducted from the skeptical perspective.  Unfortuneately, that is not what is happening here. If you are curious about Christianity, have doubts or want help in making up your own mind about the historic Jesus, don't waste your time with this movie.  There is too much other good quality work being done in this area and a 2000 year history of enlightening debate available to make watching this movie worth anyone's time.  If you are just an angry person still smarting over the beatings sadistic nuns gave you in Catholic school and want an outlet for you anger and hatred of Christianity through watching some poorly made propaganda, then this movie is for you. Me, I would just like to sue the filmmaker for my two hours of life back.",1133481600,24,2039,4.536784741144414
2454996,3,B000CAPZBC,"Brian packs this short film with a ton of info.  I loved it.  As a long self proclaimed athiest myself, it was great to have so much more information to solidify my beliefs.

However, therein lies the problem.  Brian, the filmmaker, doesn't leave the conclusion to the audience to decide.  He drills his opinion into the audiences' head, much like the Christians did to him.  Sad.  He is clearly pretty angry for what was done to him (with good cause - don't get me wrong) but he was more interested in lashing out than having a sincere debate with the experts in their field.  Brian seemed so sharp on the facts and so brilliant, that I was looking forward to him taking on a genuine smart Christian scholar, but instead he chose to attack his former (not too bright) school admin who understandably gets defensive when Brian asks if he is ashamed of himself.  What did Brian expect was going to happen?  Maybe after he spends another 10 years moving through his anger, we can be treated to a truly great CREDIBLE film from him where he becomes a great speaker and doesn't revel in the easy small victories against dumb people.

What was also sad, was ignoring the good Christians have done.  Brian's film says once you take out all the mythology from the Bible, the only thing that's left is people begat-ing each other.  What he missed were the lessons.  The lessons of taking care and defending those who cannot defend themselves.  The lessons of being the first to love the unlovable.  I've yet to see an athiest hospital or homeless shelter.  The church my wife drags me to gave so much money to a homeless old woman for medication, that they shut off the church's heat for a month.  They don't deserve to be aligned with the clich Christian rhetoric, hatred and stupid stories any more than athiests should be aligned with devil worshipers.

Brian needs to step back, clear his head, and take another shot at it.  He could do some great work once he's over his own victimhood.",1133481600,23,1983,4.563739376770538

The topic is not a new one - the thesis that Christ may have been a mythical figure goes back several centuries, and this film makes an incredible first stab at bringing this idea to the big screen.  Instead of getting too bogged down in scholarship though, the filmmakers use a big brush to quickly describe the idea and keep the film entertaining.  The movie is so pleasurable to watch that the end seems to come far too soon.  Fortunately though, the experience has just begun - the bonus interviews and especially the commentary tracks with British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, and biblical scholar Earl Doherty add several more hours of thought provoking content.

2455000,5,B000CAPZBC,"In ten years of teaching world literature at the college level, I have learned that very few Christians from the most casual liberal believer to the most devout fundamentalist know anything at all about the early years of the Christian religion.  While this film lacks the scholarly depth for which I had hoped, it does open the door to the beginnings of Christianity and to the sources of its sacred texts.  I suspect many viewers will be surprised to learn what even casual Biblical scholars have known for many decades: that the Gospels, which come first in the New Testament, were not written by companions of Jesus; that the oldest of the Gospel stories is Mark; that Mark could not have been written before 70 AD, and was probably written much later, perhaps ca. 110 AD; that the letters of the Apostle Paul (a number which were not actually written by Paul), were most prbably written in the firs century, beginning about 20 years after Biblical dates for the Crucifixion; that Paul never met Jesus; that none of the Biblical epistles say anything of Jesus' life on earth.  The film does not settle the question of Jesus' existence, but I doubt that it was intended to.  Consider it a solid introduction.  If you don't like the facts stated in the film, read the scholarly literature, which backs up all the evidence in the film, though thus far most scholars have stopped short of asserting that Jesus was a myth.

  For example, the documentary argues that the stories of Jesus were pulled from Greco-Roman mystery religions, without acknowledging--as most scholars do--that those religions just as likely pulled from the Christian stories as well. This documentary also focuses only on ignorant evangelical Christians without consulting the thousands of Christians with Phds who DO know about the origins of their faith.

2455005,5,B000CAPZBC,"I really enjoyed the movie ""The God Who Wasn't There"". It was slickly produced, it was entertaining, it has a good sound track, and it made some very incisive points (not least of which was average Christians' ignorance of their own church history and its contemporary religions). However, I have some reservations, and my overall conclusion is that it is a good start, but if you are coming to this movie for the first time, don't think it has all the answers.

""The God Who Wasn't There"" is a one-sided documentary in the style of Michael Moore (e.g., Bowling for Columbine) or Morgan Spurlock (e.g., Super Size Me). Like those other documentaries, there are enough apologists around to make the case for the other side that the film maker is not obliged to present all sides of the argument.

I have two reservations about the movie. First, the title is misleading. I'd like to one day see a slickly-produced film outlining the arguments for and against the existence of God, but this isn't it. It is not a movie about atheism, or whether or not a God or gods exist, it is a movie about whether Jesus Christ was a real person (it argues that he most likely wasn't). For people seeking information on atheism per se, books are still the best source: I thoroughly recommend Richard Carrier's ""Sense and Goodness Without God"".

Second, it is very short - barely an hour, including the interviews that run through the credits. There is so much more that could have been put into the movie (as the two commentary tracks and the extended interviews on the on the DVD demonstrate). Particularly because it is so short, I can't say that it's the best piece of movie making. Nevertheless, the fact that so much extra is provided on the DVD increases the case for purchasing it.

Now, as I said above, this movie is a good start. It doesn't, and can't in the space it has, review all the evidence and arguments about the existence of Jesus. However, for someone like me who took it for granted that Jesus was a real person it certainly provided a good introduction to the argument that he wasn't. However, to get a fuller picture of the evidence indicating that Jesus didn't exist people interested in this idea should consider reading ""the Incredible Shrinking Son of Man"", and/or ""the Jesus Puzzle"" (which has a companion website).",1132617600,30,2326,4.679706601466993
2455006,5,B000CAPZBC,"The God Who Wasn't There is a daring documentary which explores the possibility that Jesus Christ did not exist.  Director Brian Flemming provides a great deal of material to put into our thinking caps with fine interviews and historical fact, all presented in a rational, entertaining way.

There are interviews with leading scholars such as Sam Harris (The End of Faith), Dr. Alan Dundes (professor of folklore, UC Berkeley), Richard Carrier (Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism) and Robert Price (The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man).  These interviews present logical arguments against the existence of Jesus.  Dr. Dundes, in his jolly way, shows that the story of Christ is identical to the myths of other gods which supports the argument that all are just stories.

There are also interviews with Christians that make it obvious that they do not have any basis for their beliefs other than blind faith.

This movie is informational and amusing at the same time.  There is a six minute version of the life of Christ, complete with a countdown clock, contructed of old movie clips which is guaranteed to make you chuckle.  The movie compares more contemporary Jesus movies such as Jesus Christ Superstar, The Passion of The Christ and The Last Temptation of Christ.

The director also interviews the superintendent of a fundamentalist school he attended.  It becomes clear throughout the interview and subsequent narrative of his schooldays that what is being taught there is nothing but nightmarish dogma.

This DVD doesn't stop after the initial hour long film.  There are excellent extended interviews and if it is put into a PC, there is an internet-connected slide show (what a concept!) that will give the viewer even more information.

This is an especially good DVD for someone who is in a transition period from Christianity, or someone who has just began to study this subject. For those of us who have gone more in depth on researching these and similar topics, there are still a few pieces of information that when brought out are quite enlightening.  Even though I did know most of the material, it was nice to be able to visualize it and have someone else explaining.  There is so much knowledge you can get out of other peoples writings on these issues but I have to give a 5 star rating simply because this is one of very, very few documentaries on this thought level.  So in recap: if you are curious or looking for answers in reality, this is defiantly a good way to start a good foundation of research. If you have read almost everything possible and just like to keep up with any new ideas and or concepts...this is a great visual; comparatively to Christian documentaries, we are very limited to such visuals.

2455008,5,B000CAPZBC,"The reviewer who felt ""let down"" by this DVD and who worried that it was ""teasing Christians"" is either totally clueless or is engaged in a subtle attempt to discourage viewership.

I was impressed by the manner in which the director laid out his case for the non-existence of a historical Jesus. The information comes from scholars, researchers, and amatuer investigators, and is all available elsewhere, but this DVD brings the ideas together quickly and concisely. He then engages in a series of short interviews with those same scholars, researchers, and amatuer investigators, essentially allowing them to state their part of the case directly. (More in-depth interviews are available in the special features section of the DVD).

Equally illuminating are the interviews with believers in Jesus, who are allowed to make their own statements of belief without interruption. The fact that none of the believers were able to demonstrate any knowledge of the known history of Jesus or the early church demonstrates just how effectively Christian leaders have been able to divert attention from these controversial issues.

But the most compelling part of the film is the ending, where the director (a former evangelical Christian himself) visits the fundamentalist school he attended as a child and interviews the current president of that school. I won't reveal the dramatic ending to that interview (and to the film) but it truly tied everything together (the history, the controversy, and the impact on individuals today).

If you are a big fan of the Rev. Pat Robertson, (who just advised the people of Dover, PA., that they are no longer entitled to God's protection because they voted out a school board that supported teaching ""Intelligent Design"" in science class), then don't get this DVD.

There was no meat. There was nothing new. It was amusing at times, but that's about the only complement this doco deserves.

If you have ever asked yourself where our Christian church came from and where this God fits in with our history, please, please get this movie and watch it. Get at least one more copy because you will probably want to do what I did and share it on.

I have done many, many independent studies of this religion and it always leaves me confused as to how it got slapped together and then, even more confusing, why it caught on to the degree that it has. This movie answers ALL those questions in the most straight forward and easy to understand manner possible.

Let me warn you here. If you are looking for a movie to watch that supports all the Hollywood and Revival Tent Preacher's versions of God, Jesus and religion, you will not find them here. I am sure most of the people I was raised with in Missouri would call this book blasphemous. But, that is exactly what one needs to be in order not to be hornswoggled by myths and adult fairy tales. A spiritual outlook should withstand investigation, shouldn't it?",1437436800,4,1200,4.400900900900901
8096544,1,B000CAPZBC,"Brian Flemings attempted to debunk Christianity but inadvertently documented his ignorance of biblical teach.  The film ends with him in a chapel pointing out the multiple time he was ""born again.""  If he knew biblical teaching he would have known that being ""born-new"" and receiving the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is a once in a lifetime experience.  Even the early Christians in Acts 19 needed to understand this and were then indwelled by the Holy Spirit.  I view his entire film in light of his self-documented ignorance of the Bible and biblical history.",1435449600,,562,4.946808510638298
