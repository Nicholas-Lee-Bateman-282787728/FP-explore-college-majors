8168967,3,B000MGHAN2,"Italy was at the forefront of the exploitation/""B"" movie phenomenon in the early '80s.  It produced some of the highest numbers of ""giallo"" zombie flicks with some of the most explicit gore (e.g., ""Zombie,"" ""Burial Ground"").  It tended to take the template of a popular and influential movie from the western world (in this case Romero's ""Dawn Of The Dead"") and crank out untold numbers of similar films of varying quality; the only thing is they had to be really EXPLICIT, as the Italians didn't tend to keep with the same family-oriented standards of the American censors.

One movie to come out of Australia at this time was 1981's ""Mad Max 2"" (aka ""The Road Warrior"") and it left lasting ripples in Italy, so much so that the Italians churned out many a similar effort set in the post-apocalyptic future world (such as ""Warriors Of The Wasteland"" and ""The Exterminators Of The Year 3000,"" both 1983, the year the movement crested).

Enter ""2020 Texas Gladiators,"" a movie whose date falls into question because none is provided in the credits.  I've seen one source state it as 1982, another '84.  No matter, it emerged during the peak years of the Italian post-nuke films and is an archetypal example of one.

Set in 2020 (duh), after a nuclear holocaust has left the world a barren desert-like wasteland, one super oil refinery led by good people out to share the resources with one another is still producing much needed fuel to live on.

Soon, a battalion of malicious biker bandits led by an evil Nazi-like oppressor (Donald O'Brien) seize control of the refinery for their own wicked ends.  It's up to a band of lone rebels (the Texas Gladiators), a decent and upright brood, armed with rifles and other weapons to aid the good citizens of the refinery and overthrow O'Brien's dogmatic control.

I remember the awesome illustration on the box (which is not featured on Amazon but thankfully a customer image was provided) luring me in to rent this one as a kid.  (Note to whoever might finally someday release this on DVD -- do not change the cover art!)  I also can recall legendary drive-in critic Joe Bob Briggs featuring this on his ""Monstervision"" program on TNT in the late '90s, complete with his often hilarious critique and commentary.  I also fondly remember in the mid-'80s the local TV station here actually used to show many of these dubbed post-apocalyptic adventures at about three in the morning (heavily cut of course).  Many of these epics have been lost to time though and ""Gladiators"" is one of them.

Anyway, this one is pretty good for a low budget effort.  There are plenty of knife duels, shootings, flamethrowers, brief nudity, and a nice futuristic look in spots, especially O'Brien's troops complete with nifty black helmets and bullet-proof shields.  I especially like the battle for the oil refinery scene.  The dubbing is not bad either, considering that all the  actors are Italian (with the exception of O'Brien, whose lines are not dubbed) and even their names were changed to fake American names by the movie's U.S. distributor to suit American audiences better.

One face you may recognize from other early '80s Italian exploitation flicks is Sabrina Siani, and what a gorgeous face indeed!  She is the epitome of ""stunning blonde Italian beauty"" and she looks simply ravishing wielding a rifle against the advancing army.  Sabrina's very presence is worth the price of rental/purchase alone; I couldn't take my eyes off of her.

All in all, a worthy addition to the early '80s post-apocalyptic genre, and those collecting the complete works of Sabrina are strongly urged to seek out.",1217721600,7,3629,4.874592833876221
