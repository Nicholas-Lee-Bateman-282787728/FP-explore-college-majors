If you can find this in the English language, {Polish version comes with English,{PAL-VHS}}

and if your are romantically inclined towards imaginary, fantastical,

epochal bravado and heroism, then this is presently the end all, be all Glory-hole

(gem cache) of naive, innocient movie escapism. Imaginary to the extreme, grandiose bravado,

a wondrous spectacle just for late night viewing. Must be young at heart to

enjoy this story book tale, otherwise it may seem a bit pretentious, but that's the point of escapism,

departure from the doldrums.
