7853951,5,6303869009,"This video is great, although it was even better to see it live. The skating and most important-choreography is superb. I have to say though, it will appeal more to people who do understand SKATING in terms of edges and pure skating quality. To people who like ""Disney on ice"" type of productios-do not buy this video you will not appreciate it. People who admired John Curry you will love this video. Enjoy!",1022025600,5,408,4.602739726027397
7853952,2,6303869009,"I bought several ice skating tapes from Amazon and I returned this one. The praises for it such as 'dazzling', 'lavish' and 'beautiful' are much more appropriate for another tape -- ' Nutcracker On Ice' with Oksana Baiul as the leading performer. This Ice Capades  features Dorothy Hamill as a rather aged Cinderella who has lost grace and agility and her performance is technically unchallenging. I was disappointed not to see those spins ,jumps, loops, double& triple axels which are exciting and beathtaking. The pair skating of Cinderella and the Prince is uninteresting and bland. If there is not much to see from the main characters, what is there to see? I felt more delight in watching the skaters at Rockafeller Plaza than this.",994723200,3,737,4.943548387096774
7853953,5,6303869009,"Dorothy Hamill and her world-renowned Ice Capades perform the classic story of ""Cinderella"" - CINDERELLA FROZEN IN TIME.
With talented male figure skater Andrew Naylor as her Prince, Hamill slips into Cinderella like a piece of cake.  Narrated gently by Lloyd Bridges, this expertly-staged version of ""Cinderella"" boasts lavish production values, beautiful costumes, huge backdrops, and a romantic score.
The skating is very good, with the two male skaters as the Step-Sisters especially adept at character-skating.  Hamill makes for a charming heroine; the scene where she is dancing with the broom is priceless; as is the scene with the Prince at the ball.
You must buy this all-skating version of CINDERELLA FROZEN IN TIME.
From Sony Wonder / Dorothy Hamill International.",987292800,8,775,5.396694214876033
