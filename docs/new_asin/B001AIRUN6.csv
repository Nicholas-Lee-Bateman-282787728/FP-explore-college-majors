3451349,5,B001AIRUN6,This was filmed in 95 but the learning element is there and the child actors it keep it cute for little ones.,1365724800,,109,4.0
3451350,5,B001AIRUN6,It was one of Christmas gift for my almost 5 yars old son. He likes it. I didn't watch well yet...,1358035200,,98,3.7142857142857144
3451351,5,B001AIRUN6,"My niece loved this DVD, so I purchased two more.  One for my daughter and one for my nephew.  I have yet to watch it, so my review is based on a 4 year-old...but that is, who it is for.",1356739200,,186,3.625
3451352,4,B001AIRUN6,"My son started watching this movie on Netflix when he turned three. Since then we bought him a DVD copy as he asks for the ""helicopter movie"" almost every day; and he is now almost four. He doesn't seem to care for any other movies from All About series though.",1354492800,,261,4.24
3451353,1,B001AIRUN6,"If I knew this was a ""hard hat harry"" production I wouldnt have bought it, I was looking for something for an adult. Dont waste your time and money on this dribble.",1332633600,,164,4.15625
3451354,3,B001AIRUN6,I wish this were more like the I Love Airplanes movie. They intro the airplane and then just show it. The interaction with Hard Hat Harry and the kids was painful to watch. My little guy would rather watch Hx channel type helicopter shows.,1284076800,,239,4.454545454545454
3451355,5,B001AIRUN6,Highly recommended and continues to capture the attention and interest of my son. Started showing his this video when he was 1.5 yrs old and he simply loves it.,1271289600,,160,4.551724137931035
3451356,5,B001AIRUN6,"This is the first Hard Hat Harry video we own, and I think it's extremely cheesy, but I'm rating it based on how well my kids like it. They're not quite 3, and they sit through the whole thing, unlike their Sesame Street videos. Most of the information is WAY over their heads, but for some reason, it completely captivates them. (They're watching the Boat section right now, and even my 15 month old is yelling ""banana"" at the genie's banana costume - They're talking about shipping bananas on boats.)  I think the kids like it when the characters change hats/outfits/locations every time the genie snaps his fingers. Obviously, they also enjoy all the images of boats & helicopters. It's all videos of real ships and helicopters. There is a lot of information for them to learn as they are able to understand more of the narration. Right now they're talking amphibious vehicles, the reasons hover craft don't sink, and how submarines move through the water. Interesting video images, but of course the science is too complex for them yet - gives them room to grow into it.",1263772800,,1074,4.712765957446808
3451357,5,B001AIRUN6,"My little boy loves Police, Firetrucks...any kind of truck period! He loves these video's. To be honest my older kids 5- 10 years old love them also.
I also like the fact that most of the video's come with 2 shows in one...so less dvd's in the house and more $$$$ in my pocket.",1247011200,,277,4.148148148148148
3451358,4,B001AIRUN6,My son loves Hard Hat Harry.  He's been watching it for the past two years (he's almost 5) and doesn't seem to be getting bored with it.  He's learning things without even knowing it!,1231632000,,183,4.352941176470588
8277688,2,B001AIRUN6,Very cheesy.  Wouldn't hold my grandson's attention and he loves helicopters.,1506297600,,77,6.0
8277689,5,B001AIRUN6,This was a gift as well,1419638400,,23,3.0
8277690,4,B001AIRUN6,My grandson loved it.,1419292800,,21,4.5
8277691,3,B001AIRUN6,"The writing, acting, and scenery in this movie was very amateurish. If I never see Hard Hat Harry again, it will be quite all right with me. If I was rating it for me, I would give it a '1', but my helicopter-obsessed grandson (2-1/2) loved it. He didn't really care what Harry and the kids were saying or looked like (let's face it - this is a kid who is surrounded by Yo Gabba Gabba and the Muppets), he just loved it that they were riding around in helicopters.",1403308800,,464,4.166666666666667
8277692,5,B001AIRUN6,"My kids love these videos. My little boy and little girl watch these over and over again, and since there's some explanation of how things work involved, I don't mind it. Hard Hat Harry, what a guy.",1389398400,,198,4.378378378378378
8277693,5,B001AIRUN6,"So, it's a little annoying, pretty bad writing and acting... My 3 year old can't get enough though. Overall well worth it.",1388793600,,122,4.590909090909091
8277694,5,B001AIRUN6,"This show is so bad, but my two-year old loves it. He got hooked when it was on Netflix. When Netflix removed the show, he kept asking for it. Thanks for carrying it, Amazon! It was made in 1995, but the characters look like they're straight from the 80's.",1384300800,,256,4.244897959183674
8277695,5,B001AIRUN6,"My son ( 3) loves this. He can follow this documentary easily and asks at least once a day if he can watch"" helicopters"".
This series is a little bit outdated but kids usually can't tell and don't care so In general this DVD is appropriate for young kids who are interested in helicopters and boats. I plan on buying additional episodes since our little guy is such a big fan.",1378080000,,376,4.309859154929577
8277696,2,B001AIRUN6,"My 3 year old loves this, but it makes me want to poke my eyes out.  The dialogue is poorly written and the acting is TERRIBLE.  I wish we had never discovered this.",1376006400,,165,3.9696969696969697
8277697,4,B001AIRUN6,Can't go wrong with these.  I don't know about the girls but our grandsons have to watch all the time.,1369612800,,102,4.1
