722812,4,6303697259,This is a nice at home routine for a beginner. I love Rachel McLish and was expecting something a bit more challenging but it was ok. I use it occasionally on a rainy day when I can't get outside.,1255996800,,196,4.051282051282051
722813,5,6303697259,"This VHS workout with Rachel is just like going back into time and watching her all over again!  When I was weight training and teaching aerobics, she was what every women was aspiring to be!  I love the concentration and deliberate care that is taken going through each of the movements and the techniques.  I also appreciate the fact that you don't rush through this workout but learn how to do each movement to get the utmost benefit from the strength training.  This workout is well worth the money spent!  Too bad there weren't more workouts made by Rachel or I'd have all of them!",1243814400,,586,4.542857142857143

722815,5,6303697259,"rachel has a great informative un irritating style of presenting, everything is straight to the point, i'd been looking to get a tape like this for ages. Its a great intro to working with weights, I'm really happy with it",1169424000,,221,4.55
722816,5,6303697259,I THINK THIS WORKOUT IS QUITE REALISTIC AND I'M A 50+ MOTHER OF FIVE.,1167782400,,69,4.0
722817,5,6303697259,"I remember when my parents purchased this tape a while back, and I remember adding it to my own routine when I was young.

I would do the upper body one day, then cardio, then the lower body after that.

I can guarantee that if you add this video to whatever you're doing in your routine, you'll see how quickly you'll be slimming down.

I have recently burned this video to DVD so I don't have to worry about the quality of the video diminshing with time.

I say that it's definitely worth it.",1151798400,,494,4.223404255319149
722818,5,6303697259,"I bought this VHS several years ago, and have never looked back. I alternate it with other strength-training videos and DVD's but it is my core (pardon the pun) workout for weight-lifting.

Here are some reasons I love this tape:

1. Rachel is professional and gives thorough, precise instructions. She tells you exactly what muscles you will be targeting with each exercise and how to maximize your effort. She explains and demonstrates each movement very carefully and in much detail before you do the reps. You get variations for beginning exercisers and good camera angles so you can easily follow along and see exactly what's happening.

2. Rachel is low-key and does not assume that the only reason you are lifting is for appearance's sake. (Of course, we cannot help but look at her wonderfully toned body and say, ""I want that look for myself."") She is neither shallow nor spunky. What a mercy that is.

3. The exercises are divided into uppper and lower body (with ab) sections, so you can divide the workout to suit your schedule. I love the ab work! It is a short section of the tape, but super-effective. I also am so pleased that it's not a series of the same old crunches.

Here's a few things you need to consider:

1. you will need to warm up and cool down on your own.

2. there is not enough time allowed to do the stretches effectively. Just pause the tape so you can get them in.

3. once you learn the exercises, you might be tapping your foot through the instructions UNLESS you use that time to put in a third set of reps. Yep, it times out great!

I noticed how inexpensive it was to purchase this video from Amazon sellers and you really owe it to yourself to give this excellent tape a try.",1141257600,,1716,4.4743589743589745
722819,5,6303697259,"I have had this video from the time it came out.  There was a time when I had some medical problems and couldn't work out.  I have since started back and am getting back in shape with the ""In Shape"" video.  This video is by far the best exercise video. I have worked out with the sweat, high impact, and very physical video's but the ""In Shape"" video by far gives me a better out come.  I was looking forward to another video.  In one of Rachel's special's, she stated that she was working on a series of these.  I was wondering if they were ever published.  I would love to get my hands on them.  Like I said the video ""In Shape"" is #1.  Please let me know if I can get more exercise video's.  Also, Rachel, you are my idol.  We are the same age and you look great. I have had 4 kids and have had some ups and downs but you still inspire me. What are some of your beauty secrets.  You look great.",1133654400,,897,3.9775280898876404
722820,4,6303697259,"This workout features Rachel McLish, former Ms. Olympia bodybuilding champion.  She leads you one on one through a weight training workout that hits all the muscle groups in an hour.  It is split up between uppper and lower body, each about 30 minutes.  There is no warmup, so you should be warmed up before starting.  Rachel uses only one set of weights throughout the whole workout, 8lbs which is comfortably challenging for her.  One might want to use a few different sets of dumbells depending on which muscle group is being worked.  A weight bench is also used though Rachel will show modifications or options for those who do not have one.

Upper body is first, you will start with shoulders, doing side lateral raises, alternating shoulder presses, rear delt raises, and uprights, which is a variation of an upright row.  Rachel demonstrates all the exercises before starting the set, most of which are 12 reps, you will do 2 sets of each exercise.  You move on to abs, chest and back next, here you will do bench crunches, chest flies with rotation, and one arm lat rows.  Then you will work your arms some more with tricep kickbacks, alternating bicep curls with rotation at the top, angled bicep curls, and more tricep kickbacks with a slightly more challenging twist.  You finish out this segment with one arm lying tricep extensions and ribcage pullovers.

More abs and lower body are next, all of which are performed on the floor. Here you will see a lot of different variations of bridge work exercises targeting the hamstrings and behind, all done unweighted of course.  The ab work consists of more oblique crunches and other ab exercises.  Following this you will do standing lower body exercises, starting with stiff legged dead lifts, then plie squats, then you will put down your weights and do side leg lifts with some pulsing variations and calf raises.  Then you will pick up your weights again and do squats and forward and reverse lunges.  Finally you will lie on your front and do some leg lifts which strengthen the back.  Then you will do a brief cooldown and stretch.

Overall, this is a solid weight training workout, although I would recommend it for those already familiar with weight training.  Rachel is good with tips and emphasizing good form but there are some exercises where her form is not very good.  An example is the plie squats, good form is stressed here as your knees do not go past your toes, but when actually performing the exercise she does just that.  Someone not familiar with correct technique could really hurt their knees.

That is really the only negative though, Rachel is a very pleasant instructor with an awesome figure that I certainly wouldn't mind having.  She is encouraging with helpful hints and information and I thought she did a good job for the most part.

She lets you know how many reps will be done for each exercise, which I find helpful.  All in all, not a bad effort by Rachel.  Recommended for those, who like but are already familiar with weight training.",1130025600,,3033,4.729523809523809
722821,4,6303697259,"Having borrowed this video from a friend, I purchased one.  I am a stay-at-home mom trying to stay in shape.  The exercises are excellent.",1126224000,,138,4.708333333333333
722904,4,6303697259,"This workout video has been reviewed very thoroughly by others whose opinion I share. This grueling 1-hour workout by the former Ms. Olympia is fantastic for adding depth to your toning workouts. Using medium to heavy handweights you run the gamut, from shoulders to calves: shoulders, pecs, delts, bi- and triceps, abs, buns, hamstrings, quads and calves. Direction is clear and concise and Rachel is affable without being condescending. She's attractive but isn't your typical Barbie-Doll fitness leader and works out in comfortable but not flashy clothing or surroudings. This is one that DH actually offered to do with me (though he only went through two exercises before sitting on the sofa to watch!). The only disappointment was that for the hour-long program, there were only two different stretches for the cool-down. There is no warm-up so you should at least walk in place for 5 minutes before starting the workout. I would probably get bored of this routine if I did it more than once a week but it's good to keep in your rotation.

LEVEL: any, using weights appropriate for your level;

EQUIPMENT: hand weights; bench helpful but not necessary; towel or mat if you don't have a carpeted workout area.

722905,5,6303697259,"There are hundreds of aerobics videos to choose from. I walk/jog/run, and needed something like this to develop muscle fast. This is by far the best workout video for that purpose or for toning (for those who do not want to develop muscle.) Two repetitions are just right. Three reps would have made the workout too long or she would have had to skip certain muscles. She covers every muscle. There is no hype and no distractions. It is very professional, thorough, and unique. The best I have found. I wish it were available in DVD format.",1013817600,,540,4.577319587628866

It helps in that way, however there are not enough repetitions, specifically the bicep area.  The  shoulder segment is good.  The great part of the video is the time it  takes, 22 minutes for upper body workout.  The lower body workout is  fantastic.  Very difficult to complete.  I would recommend the video,  however the intensity is somewhat short of expectations.  A big advantage  of the video is that it includes both upper and lower body workouts.

The workout looks like nothing but when you pay attention to her instruction and technique you'll find out how  weak you really are even with small dumbells.  She keeps you challenged, as  I have been working out for many years and still have a hard time  completing the entire workout. The workout is done with 8lb dumbells, your  own bodyweight and stretching.  Can easily be done at home or in a hotel.  CONCENTRATE on perfecting the movements.

Her work out is great, she pretty much shows you proper form, except to keep your knees over your feet,  she goes overboard on that one. I did learn alot from this workout. I have been working out at home/gyms for years,  I have a collection of DVD's. My only problem with this DVD is of course it's dated and I like the cardio sculpt DVD's because I get it all in one workout in 30 minutes. This does not get my heart rate going and it's longer than 30 minutes. I feel like I have to do a separate cardio after, I prefer not to do that, my preference though, overall it's a good workout.",1433980800,,661,3.962406015037594

It's a total body workout, she does not miss any muscle. It's a very easy paced workout and she explains every move very well. If your more advanced then use heavier weights and even add ankle weights. I love this tape! I like to mix up the ""old style"" workouts with the present style workouts because I think they both are worth it!",1342051200,,492,4.53932584269663

The upper body workout is very easy, but very effective and you can feel that you are working every muscle in your arms. The lower body was a little harder for me but I knew that it had worked because the next day I was in pain, which is a good sign it lets me know I did what I was suppose to. Both are very precise and she tells you which muscles are being worked. I love it and continue to do it. I started out with 3lb weights and now I am moving up.
