7994969,5,B0000A0DU4,"This is the DVD single to Play's second album. It's a lot more grown up than the first and exhibits everything that might be going on in the mind of a teenage girl.

The video for ""I Must Not Chase the Boys,"" is amazing. The song is about parents and society expecting you to be a little girl, but wanting to be flirty and have boyfriends and such. There's nothing inappropriate about it. The video is very symbolic in varying ways. All, if not most, of the shots illistrate a young girl wanting to explore herself and new things, but being held back by the past and different things around her-- when in the end, she makes the final decision. I.E.: Anna having to write lines- ""I must not chase the boys,"" over and over again. Faye being locked inside the cage, but having the key hanging around her neck. It's a very creative and unique video. Not like more of the cheesy, meaningless things you'd see on MTV today.

""Whole Again,"" is a remake of the original song. In case you've never heard the original, it's about breaking up with a boy, being all upset, feeling like a piece of you is gone, and realizing that only getting back together with him would make you ""whole again."" Such a cute message. The video for this is the extended version, I might add. It's so adorable-- Half of the video is set in the past, 1957, to be exact. (Love the 50's outfits the girls wore in the vintage shots. The back-drop was cute, as well.) The other half shows clips of the girls hanging out with guys, whom apparently aren't their boyfriends anymore, but were (in one form or another) at the time.

Overall, the videos are great and surpass the quality of the first DVD single, which was by far, amazing. If you're a Play fan, this is a definite must-have. If you aren't a Play fan, buy the DVD and you will be!",1152489600,,1803,4.3601190476190474
7994970,4,B0000A0DU4,"Being a pretty big fan of PLAY I decided to check out this DVD, because I haven't seen the music videos anywhere else.
I Must Not Chase the Boys ~ Well, the song's inapproperiate, but I never knew how bad the video would actually be. It's a  dark, creepy video...with one of the girls like, in a cage...which I don't understand. And the chorus is pretty cool - they're preforming with a band behind them and they've all got funky, 80s type hair.
Whole Again ~ This videos a lot better (thankfully) - and I love the clothes/hair in it. Because it takes place in the 50's it's really cheesy and happy, but that's the best part! I would have bought the DVD just for this song, but getting an extra video was okay too.
In short, this is a good DVD, but there's only two videos and they're both cool...but I Must Not Chase the Boys is really weird and slightly mature for their age (14-16).
