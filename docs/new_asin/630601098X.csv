1102817,1,630601098X,"I watched this film in amazement that it is somehow considered important or new.  It is just a rehash of the 1960s with spoiled middle class children attacking their ""bourgeois"" and ""fascist"" society while managing not to work.  There certainly is terrible prejudice against the mentally ill,but this film exploits it.  If you want to change things you must have real talent and make a film about what it really feels like to be mentally ill.  Having no talent is no longer enough i'm afraid.",1032134400,7,492,4.752941176470588
1102818,4,630601098X,"""The Idiots"" (""Idioterne"") is the controversial 1998 black comedy by Danish director Lars von Trier (""Breaking the Waves,"" ""Zentropa,"" ""The Kingdom) that has been the target of censor boards around the world.  Karen (Bodil Jorgensen) finds herself introduced to a group of intelligent, good-looking young adults who live together and led by the charismatic Stoffer (Jens Albinus).  They all decide they will provoke a response from the bourgeoisie by going out in public and pretending to be mentally and/or physically disabled.
Their constant efforts to create anarchy in every situation is basically what we would have called guerilla theater back in the Sixties.  But the larger question is whether the film itself is part of the attack.  The people confronted with these ""idiots"" are always shocked, angered, disturbed, or at least annoyed.  Yet these are reactions the viewing audience can have as well to what they see; ""The Idiots"" is guerilla theater in the tradition of Andy Kaufman, albeit with sexually explicit scenes thrown in to really keep you guessing as to what is really going on.  If you have never seen a truly provocative film, then, yes, I fully expect ""The Idiots"" might prove to be too much for you to handle.
This film is made under the Dogma banner, which von Trier established in 1995 as a restrictive anti-establishment manifesto requiring filmmakers to avoid the use of props, sets, artificial sound and light, lens filters and superficial action, all while filming with one handheld camera.  Lars von Trier won the FIPRESCI Award at the London Film Festival for this film.  The citation reads, in part, ""For its attempt to rethink film language and social rules from scratch and willingness to accept the limitations of both its method and cultural assumptions.""  I am not sure the film works as either satire or social criticism simply because it is so outrageous that it can easily be dismissed by the very people you would assume its target audience.  Still, you must admit it holds true to the principles of the Dogma manifesto.
Final note: My understanding is that the videotape version distributed in the U.S. does not have anything cut from the film; both versions run 117 minutes.  However, black bars are used to cover certain shots in the orgy scene (you should know of what without me having to tell you) in order to avoid a NC-17 rating.  Once again it appears we have the irony that the system tries to declaw an artistic effort in the name of profitability.",1021766400,18,2501,4.928571428571429
1102819,1,630601098X,"Hugely disappointing flick by otherwise very talented Lars von Trier. His previous movies ZENTROPA and BREAKING THE WAVES are examples of mesmerizing movies - movies that will stay with you. Therefore it is so disappointing to watch The Idiots.

1102821,4,630601098X,"Lars Von Trier's THE IDIOTS is the second movie shot according to the rules of DOGMA 95. This chart, signed by Thomas Vinterberg, the author of the masterpiece FESTEN, and Lars Von Trier is the sign of a romantic reaction against today cinema. Vinterberg and Von Trier say no to computer helped movies, no to sound mixing and editing, no to everything that is the trademark of 99% of the movies produced each year.
So, if you make the effort to accept images which are always moving because the camera is placed on the camera operator's shoulder, if you don't mind to have the sound operator appearing sometimes in the middle of a scene with his micro, you are ready to experiment THE IDIOTS. To be honest, I wasn't disturbed at all by the appearance of the microphone in certain scenes because it strangely adds to the documentary atmosphere of the movie. You will also accept as natural and not at all shocking the few sex scenes, not simulated nor censored - at least in the european copies - , of THE IDIOTS.
The main argument of THE IDIOTS is, on the contrary, very disturbing. A dozen of Danish young boys and girls, deceived by the society they are living in, decide to take revenge of this society by creating uncomfortable situations. So, as soon as they are in public places, they are pretending they are mental deficient people and don't hesitate to enjoy the multiple advantages this lie can create. If I enjoyed a lot the comic scenes of THE IDIOTS, recognizing the hypocritical attitudes of our society towards its weakest members, I was in the same time ashamed of my lack of respect. And, in my opinion, THE IDIOTS is a very important movie because, unlike the vast majority of the non-Dogma 95 movies, this film will touch your heart and the roots of your morals.

1102822,4,630601098X,"The Idiots is one of the better genre-avoiding movies of recent times. Dark comedy slams straight into uncomfortable realism as director Lars von Trier and his dedicated cast commit to celluloide some truly unforgettable set-pieces in a narative that never once tells you how to react to what you are seeing.
Von Trier is once again in top form, building on his already impressive filmography (his epic two-parter 'The Kingdom' was shown in weekly instalments on Australian TV recently; THE best thing around, roll on part III) to tell the story of another female character determined to see to the end of her decisions, however painful the consequences may be for the people around her.

1102823,5,630601098X,"It is a shame that more publicity has been made about the Dogma 95 experiment than about the products they rendered. So try looking beyond the Dogma stamp. The Idiots is an amazing film built upon a complex story and reveals elements of the human condition rarely revealed on the big screen. Von Trier is an expert at creating shocking cinema. Not only is it shocking because it is filmed differently than almost any other film you've seen, but it is also shocking because it is filled with nudity, vulgarity and controversial themes. It makes fun of mentally retarded adults under the guise of a serious social experiment. It has violent fights, an orgy scene... Despite all this, try looking beyond the shocking elements. What you will find beyond all the things that many critics chose not to look past is an emotionally powerful portrayal of a group of individuals searching for a way in which to view their identity in a way that is devoid of all social artifices. It is a story of a people trying to actively live out an idea that there is something essential about their being which can be reached through an extreme modification of their behaviour. It becomes increasingly clear throughout the narrative that these people are running away from who they are rather than finding something essential. The emotional tension that is being withheld slowly rises to the surface and culminates in one of the most devastating scenes I've ever witnessed. It is moving not just because it deals with death, but because it illuminates in an exaggerated fashion the way in which people in society today hide from themselves and subsequently reveal themselves to be frail and insecure. Of course, all of the elements that go into making this such a shocking film are inextricably incorporated into the emotional power created. You need to watch this film while withholding moral judgements and consider the issues that are being so skilfully portrayed in a way no other director was able to do before Dogma 95.",979776000,27,2004,4.845481049562682

The film  contains some excellent scenes (such as when the group goes swimming to the  local pool) and characters.  The best  by far is Stoffer, the suave, smooth  talking leader who won't let the others quit.

1103006,5,630601098X,"This is one of the best films that Lars Von Trier (director of Dancer in the Dark, Dogville, and Breaking the Waves) has ever done in my opinion. It is an excellent example of Dogme 95, a pact by several filmmakers (of which Von Trier is arguably the most famous) to create more realism in cinema by restraining what the director can do. It's usually associated what is sometimes considered shaky camera work. [...]

While all of Von Trier's films since have been influenced by his work in this style, most are not strictly Dogme films. Dancer in the Dark for example switches back and forth to heavily stylized scenes and contains what is considered to be ""superficial action."" The Idiots is an early example of what this genre was meant to look like,

The manifesto first:

I swear to submit to the following set of rules drawn up and confirmed by DOGMA 95:
1- Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).
2- The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.)
3- The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.
4- The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera.)
5- Optical work and filters are forbidden.
6- The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)
7- Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now.)
8- Genre movies are not acceptable.
9- The film format must be Academy 35 mm.
10- The director must not be credited.
11- Furthermore I swear as a director to refrain from personal taste! I am no longer an artist. I swear to refrain from creating a ""work"", as I regard the instant as more important than the whole.
12- My supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and settings. I swear to do so by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any aesthetic considerations.
Thus I make my VOW OF CHASTITY.
Copenhagen, Monday 13 March 1995
On behalf of DOGMA 95
Lars von Trier Thomas Vinterberg

The concept of Chastity seems to imply all they refuse is for them nothing but a rape. They are raped by the camera, the director-dom, the actor-dom, etc. In other words they dream about making films without any cinema technology. They thus reduce their films to a mirage inside a delusion. And yet here is one film they made.

The film is an absolute illustration of these principles. It describes a voluntary community, if not a commune of some sort, of people systematically called, in the English subtitles since the film is in Danish, idiots, retards and other nice terms of this type. All the actors are acting their own parts, their own reality, their own truth. The retards in the film are retards in society.

Does this bring any truth?

These people who are going to a restaurant and acting their mental and behavioral handicap against the personnel and the customers in order to be kicked out, after eating of course, without paying does not reveal anything true or truthful since these people are playing what they are to gain an advantage. This is thus a big lie and nothing but racket.

In fact it reveals that the only decent people are more or less the innocent witnesses who actually accept the disturbance with patience or even accept to help the differently-abled persons with some empathy and care, like two tattooed bikers who actually take one of them who had been ""entrusted"" to them by his ""educator"" to the toilet and help him urinate without any fishiness.

Of course the fact that it is filmed is the proof it is all a lie. Too bad for Lars von Trier: we know there is a camera filming the scene that has probably been rehearsed several times.

The only moment when we may think something slightly enlightening is provided is at the end when an officially normal  woman who is under a strong post-traumatic stress syndrome due to the death of her infant tries to go back to her husband and family. She is accepted, including the real handicapped woman who accompanies her, and yet she is unable to cope and she plays retard with catastrophic consequences. When we know she had escaped into that commune on the day before the funeral of her own child, we can measure how deep her Trauma was but that has little to do with mental handicap.

This Dogma thing seems to me to be extremely over-rated.
