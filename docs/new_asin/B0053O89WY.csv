4536074,5,B0053O89WY,The first 2 episodes have been just as good as all the previous seasons. If you enjoyed this show before you will enjoy the beginning of this season. Cant wait for more episodes.,1317168000,,178,4.424242424242424
4536075,5,B0053O89WY,"Since I posted my review of this episode a lot has changed.  I'd like to think that my review made some difference, but even if it didn't my objections in the original review have all been corrected.  The first season I had previously purchased is now available, all seasons are now available for purchase on Amazon.com, and all seasons are now offered in HD.  Because of that I am revising my review to a 5 star rating.  I've left the original review below so that people who didn't see it know what I'm referring to.  I hope the person(s) behind the licensing of ""The Big Bang Theory"" and other series start to realize the huge market they have in digital distribution.

Oh, just for anyone who might read this that has any power over licensing for Amazon Instant Video.  I don't own a TV and haven't for many years.  I stopped paying for satellite when I missed an episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"" on my DVR and found there was no way for me to watch the missed episode legally.  I now only watch TV online.  I have owned VHS tapes and DVDs.  I refuse to buy the same movies, or others, on Blu-Ray.  I'm tired of the copyright holders changing formats and expecting us to re-purchase products we already own.  This also applies to music with audio cassettes and CDs.  Copyright holders keep complaining about how file sharing is costing them money.  What about the money I've wasted buying items that I can no longer use?  I have spent quite a bit of money on duplicate copies of copyrighted material.  One more thing in this little rant.  The copyright holders also tend to not release some products in new formats.  I have a number of items that are OOP (Out Of Print).  Since the copyright holders don't think it worth it to re-release these items people who wish to purchase them are just out of luck or have to find an old and rare print.

Original review:
----------------------------------------
So, they have decided to sell the fifth season of ""The Big Bang Theory"" on Amazon.com.  Meanwhile, I can't access the first season I've already purchased because of ""licensing restrictions"".  What a joke.  I don't know who is in charge of licensing on ""The Big Bang Theory"", but they should be fired.  It just proves once again that the companies in charge of TV, movies, music, etc. have no clue when it comes to digital distribution.

This is in no way a slam at Amazon.com.  I've been very happy with them.  This is a slam at whoever is in charge of licensing the TV series ""The Big Bang Theory"".",1316822400,4,2505,4.518930957683741

What could be more fun as a escape!!",1433548800,,281,4.714285714285714
4537142,5,B0053O89WY,"The traditional multi-camera sitcom is struggling to make a come back, and the show that is definitely helping the resurgence is The Big Bang Theory.  It's just finished season 5 , and is going as strong as ever.

The show follows the misadventures of four brilliant but socially awkward scientists, and their hot, normal neighbor.  The last two seasons have introduced some equally brilliant women as love interests for at least two of the guys.  While some don't like those characters, I happen to think they've really added to the show.

Season 5 picks up exactly where season 4 left off.  Penny (Kaley Cuoco) has just spent a drunken night with Raj (Kunal Nayyar).  While it wasn't quite what it appeared, they quickly go back to normal, which isn't hard when Raj will only talk to women when he's drunk.

Meanwhile, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) tries to maintain a long distance relationship before putting his relationship with Penny back in a beta test.  Sheldon (Jim Parsons) is forced to take his relationship with Amy (Mayim Bialik) to the next level - and he insists they both sign a relationship agreement.  Leonard finds a loophole in his relationship with Sheldon when he voids the friendship clause.  And Howard (Simon Helberg) gets ready for a trip into space and his marriage to Bernadette (Melissa Rauch).

That's just a few of the bigger storylines of the season.  Each episode is filled with laughs.  Some people complain the show isn't as funny as it used to be, but I find it hysterical just about every week.  Yes, they have one or two weeks that fall flat, but they are by far the exception rather than the rule.  And even then, there are some great lines and classic moments.

Howard and Bernadette have the biggest story arcs of the season, and I must say I love watching the two of them interact.  Usually, they are so sweet together, although when they fight it can be pretty funny as well.  Howard used to annoy me like crazy, but now I actually find I like him.

Of course, the real star of the show is still Sheldon.  While there are some great episodes that don't feature him as prominently, he still gets most of the best lines and the best laughs.

The problem most people who complain about this show have with it is Amy and Bernadette.  They are characters that were added in season 3 and 4, and some people feel they've ruined the dynamic of the show.  Personally, I think they've helped the show develop.  As fun as seasons one and two are, the show would be pretty boring if they were still doing those storylines three years later.  These characters have allowed the guys to change and the writers to find new storylines.  While I do find Amy's comments about Penny uncomfortable at times, I still find her mostly funny.

As far as cameos go, we've got Wil Wheaton, Brent Spiner, and Dr. Stephen Hawkins appear as themselves, and Leonard Nimoy voices a Spock doll.

The show pasted the 100 episode mark this season, and that means the cast is very familiar with their characters.  It shows, too, in the acting.  Everyone is believable and comfortable with their parts, and it's easy to just sit back and laugh as the show plays.

There were 24 half hour episodes in season 5, and they are all included in this set in their native wide screen and full surround.  Extras include a gag reel, behind the scenes look at the departments that go into creating an episode of the show, and a look at the 100th episode.  The set is available in just DVD or in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo set.

The Big Bang Theory is just as funny now as it was originally, and that's saying something for a show in it's fifth season .  If you are looking to laugh, this is a set to get.",1433376000,,3688,4.534848484848485

After that, we became hooked and looked forward to watching it each night since several episodes run back-to-back each evening. We decided that we needed to own each of the seasons as they came out so we could see them in their intended order. The individual characters are lovable in their own way and I love the fact that they included a character with selective mutism. Our favorites are Sheldon and Bernadette, though the series would not be the same if any one of them was phased out of the series. The storyline continues to develop nicely and it hasn't reached the point of becoming stale any time soon. The series is geared toward a mature audience. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well-developed group of quirky characters.",1421539200,,884,4.60126582278481

4537498,4,B0053O89WY,"This was the last substantially good season of TBBT.

Although Season 6 has a handful of decent episodes, the standard sitcom relationship humor tropes were really starting to overtake the original premise of the show. The supposed geniuses were starting to be seriously dumbed down - depictions of career and nerd hobby pursuits jettisoned to a large extent - to be led around by the nose by their (much wiser) girlfriends in familiar and tired ways. It's only gotten worse in seasons 7 and 8 (so far), which have been unmitigated disasters for fans who enjoyed the original premise of the show. Those who like the earlier seasons of TBBT may want to stop their collection here at season 5. If you really love the show ""Friends"", pick up seasons 6 and 7 as well.",1417910400,,763,4.651851851851852

The jokes become lame, the characters predictable and the whole thing just seems to go down the drain. It's still funnier than just about any other sitcom on tv at the moment, but I'm disappointed that they didn't keep it as sharp as the first few seasons.",1414281600,2,516,4.222222222222222

The girls have arrived and are as present and important as the main characters. And in some instances, they all seem to be main characters now. It would be hard to imagine Howard without Bernadette, or Sheldon without Amy. I guess that's why Raj hasn't found a love interest as yet.

Every one of the major characters has evolved in that slow, if ever, way that people do: shedding societal ills like sexism, racism, bigotry.  Some of the minor characters, like Sheldon's uber-religious mother, are depicted as more staid and maintaining their faults, but Sheldon's mother is also shown as a loving and kind person who happened to be born and raised in an uber-religious milieu.

4537818,5,B0053O89WY,"Maybe it's because I'm a computer guy (read: nerd) who likes World of Warcraft and other games.  Maybe it's because I'm dating a gorgeous woman who is the girl of my dreams.  Maybe it's because I wish I was as smart as Sheldon and had such little regard for what others think of me.

I don't know what it is... but this show is probably my all-time favorite.

The interaction between the characters is more complex than what appears at the surface level, and the chemistry between them all if fantastic.

The writing is done very well, the jokes are clever and the dialogue is always interesting.

If you watch some of the extras and see the actors not in character, you really gain an appreciation for how good they really are.

Wonderful show... great props... great writing... great acting... great sets... always entertaining and funny.

Also, I love how they're eating all the time... that's pretty much when you interact with your friends the most.",1404691200,,954,4.704819277108434

4537836,5,B0053O89WY,"The Big Bang Theory is the one show I turn to consistently if I'm having a bad day and need a good laugh. Sometimes the story lines aren't as good as they could be, but overall it's one of my favorite tv shows. One of the things I like the best about the show is that the characters all care about each other. They may get irritated with each other and have arguments, but there's no outright nastiness or mean-spiritedness on the show. That's refreshing when so many comedies rely on nasty comments and humiliation of characters to get laughs. Jim Parsons' character (Sheldon Cooper) is as delightful as he is annoying. I enjoy watching Sheldon develop as a character. Really, they all do and it's good to see. Too many shows lack character development and get stuck in a rut. BBT does not. I absolutely adore this show. Even a bad episode is better than most of the other ""comedies"" on tv.",1403568000,2,891,4.47239263803681

Now my kids and my SO love the show.  Although my kids and I are on season 5 in our binge watching sessions (school and homework permitting), the SO wants to start watching this show from the beginning, despite seeing a few episodes here an there.
I've talked to several non-nerdy friends who also love to watch this show.  Of course I don't think they worship Sheldon like we do, lol.  I hope this show goes on for at least ten seasons.  It's one of the few shows I will buy and keep watching episodes from over and over again.",1401321600,,696,4.242424242424242

4537872,5,B0053O89WY,The best season by far. Howard going into space is hilarious.  Bernadette turning into Howard's Mom priceless.  My favorite season to date.,1401235200,,139,5.2727272727272725
4537902,5,B0053O89WY,"THE BIG BANG THEORY was a failed pilot until creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady re-wrote the script to take advantage of the chemistry between lead actors Jim Parsons and Johnny Galecki. The series went on the air in 2007 and quickly became a national favorite. Most comedies traffic in stereotypes and this series is no different, centering on a group of socially inept geniuses who run afoul of the pretty but intellectually average girl who lives across the hall--but the fun of the series is in the way it undercuts the stereotypes, giving us glimpses of humor and humanity in unexpected and often laugh-out-loud ways.

The first season was a little ify, with writers and actors working to set the characters and their various storylines; the fifty season was also a little ify, as the series struggled to accomodate new characters.  But the fifth season nails everything down perfectly, continuing to focus on Leonard (Johnny Galecki) as he struggles to maintain a long distance romance with Pryia (Aarti Mann) while still coping with his affection for Penny (Kaley Couco)--and swerves brilliantly into the evolving relationship between Sheldon and Amy (Jim Parsons and Mayim Bialik) and the impending nuptuals of Howard and Bernadette (Simon Helberg and Melissa Rauch.)  In the meantime, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) struggles to find a girlfriend of his own, which leads to comic disaster.

As usual, each episode is wickedly, wildly funny.  My own favorite, however, is ""The Infestation Hypothesis,"" in which Penny horrifies germaphobe Sheldon by rescuing a seemingly attractive chair from the street.  In any case, this is THE BIG BANG THEORY at top form, and very, very funny.  Recommended.

4538041,4,B0053O89WY,"Unlike some other seasons, this one felt the flattest to me. Doing little to move the characters forward or develop their characters this season felt the most generic of the lot.

4538140,4,B0053O89WY,"It's always been fashionable for Nerds to pose as superior beings who would like to believe themselves to be too sophisticated for the mainstream sitcom: except when that sitcom is The Big Bang Theory and plays all too nicely to their (our) particular intellectual and sexual wish fulfillment fantasies.  In this aspect the show rather resembles Downton Abbey, which stripped to its core is little more than Days of Our Lives retooled for an audience that reads the New York Times.  It's both embarrassing and fascinating (and relaxing) to be so addicted to a kind of TV show I would ordinarily despise.

Addictive as it undeniably is in its current incarnation, the show in some ways almost seems an evolutionary throwback to the 1990s when episode plots were largely self-contained and the laugh track reigned supreme.  It's not hard to see how the show's creators could have made the show into something more adventurous a la Firefly or the original Arrested Development: the short lifespans of both shows probably explain why they didn't.  One can't help but wonder what sort of mischief the talented BBT ensemble might have gotten themselves into if given the less constrictive canvas of online-only media to work with: a looser, more improv-driven style seems like a better fit for the show's spirit and is presumably much easier to make work financially via online streaming. Amazon would do well to snatch up many if not all of the show's actors and down the road give them something they can have a bit more fun with, while doing away with grating vestigial devices such as the laugh track that BBT includes presumably in order to make the show more friendly for syndicated TV.

In this sense the show might be thought of as before its time, if only as an example of what might have been (or still might be) possible had it started now, instead of 7 years ago.",1390176000,,1869,4.7708978328173375

It was lacking something that I wish I could describe. Really it came down to the fact that if I watch all of the other season's I probably wouldn't watch this one...

Aside from that, Howard's relationship with fiance Bernadette usually makes you crack up from watching what goes on between them, but then even they have some moments that can be very touching. Not to sound like a total douche bag, but you gotta love the odd relationship between Sheldon and Amy. And Raj, (sigh) he'll be alright, I guess.

This show is funny, friendly, and yet still has a biting sarcasm all its own. The interaction between the friends and eventual girlfriends  is filled with hysterical social and emotional blunders as they struggle to understand each other, the world, and their place in it.

Some might find it shocking to note the character growth within the series. Trust me, it's there. :-) But as long as the humor is there, this group will be a television mainstay!! Enjoy the reign of the nerds!!",1374451200,,588,4.528301886792453

This means throwing in a pizza, settling down in the living room and letting Penny....Penny....Penny....rip.  Jim Parsons has got to be one of the most talented comedians around.  But he would be lost without the chemistry between him and Leonard, throw in Raj and Howard, and then the slowly increasing female population, well, it's ridiculously funny. Amy, Bernadette, Penny...heck...ANY of these characters could have turned out to be cliche'.  Happily, the writing talent matches the acting talent.

I remember when I first heard of this show before the pilot it was billed as ""two nerds get the pretty girl.""  Ah what a disservice that advertising was!!

We watch each new episode repeatedly, I buy every DVD set that comes out, and then we Big-Bang-alize in marathon sessions off-season.

I love great comedy but I must confess that most of the comedy shows on television today I don't find remotely funny. The Big Bang Theory is comedy done right. It's intelligent humor based on a group of nerd friends, who have difficulty adapting socially.
I started watching Big Bang Theory thanks to the reruns on Fox shown on week nights. As a result of seeing the reruns, I now watch the Big Bang series on Thursdays now. I have also enjoyed the series so much that I bought seasons 3,4 and 5 for home viewing. I am looking forward to the release of season 6 in September to acquire it for my collection.

I am obsessed with this show, but it seems the bonus features on the dvds are lacking, or maybe I'm used to movies with lots of bonus features and tv shows don't have as many? Some of the dvds in each season have no bonuses at all, and others have 2 bonuses.

None of the bonuses are very in-depth with the cast. It seems to be mostly crew stuff with a tiny bit of cast. While the bonuses are interesting, they aren't that amazing.",1372982400,,479,4.252747252747253

Everything from a Halloween-like episode to ""Shamy"" relationship to Howard and Bernadette's upcoming marriage to Leonard's love dilemma, we get it all. I found myself laughing more this season than the last one and the show gets better and better with every episode. The show is coming back for a 7th season and an 8th season as well. Now on to the blu ray.

  I purchased this at the price it's at now, (22.49)and I got to say, that's a damn good deal for this show as I saw it at Best Buy for 39.99, but Best Buy does price-match as long as it's shipped & sold from Amazon. For 22.49, you get the whole 5th season of The Big Bang Theory on 2 blu ray discs, 3 dvd discs and on Ultraviolet digital copy all in one. That's basically a $60 deal. Highly recommend and I'll be looking forward to the 6th season blu ray this September. Anyways, great show and a great blu ray set.

I'm on the happy side of 70 and get a great laugh out of it, even though I do use the subtitles sometimes, so I don't miss out on things said 'the American Way'.

We got Blu-Ray, DVD, and Ultraviolet for the cost of Ultraviolet alone...  Maybe even a little cheaper.  Besides the great deal, as always the show is awesome!!  So awaiting season 7 to start!",1370822400,,366,4.761904761904762

I do not feel it is better or worse. At this point we are still stuck at the level season four left us at. Just showing our four favorite nerds learning to live life and still hold the sanctity of their nerdome. What I do like about this season is the story lines of Sheldon and Raj as we watch Sheldon slowly start to realize there is someone in his life who actually has feelings for him and Raj who is still trying to find that special someone. It all ends of course with an event that was three years in the making and now we move on to season six and see what will unfold in all of its nerdy glory.",1370044800,,771,3.948717948717949

4539213,5,B0053O89WY,"I started watching this at season 2.  Four nerds working at Caltech and living in Pasadena, Ca.  I live in Los Angeles County, so it's been fun watching these guys and now three ladies.  It's a really funny show.  By far, my favorite episode is Einstein Approximation (season 3, episode 14).  Or other wise known as just Sheldon in the ball pit.  Bazanga.

My favorite episode of season 5 is the Shiny Trinket Maneuver (12th episode).  Or better known as the episode where Sheldon gives Amy a tiara.  Heck, if that tiara had real diamonds, I'd have been just as excited as Amy was.  ;)

If you think this is just for the young 20 something, you're wrong.  My 80 year old grandfather likes this show.  I am 36 years old.  My dad, aunts and uncles also like this show.  Every family function we have, one topic we all have in common to discuss is what's going on in the Big Bang Theory show.

Season 5 has been pretty good.  I love Shamy (Sheldon and Amy combined).  Both actors are my favorite as well.  Sheldon is played by talented Jim Parsons.  He has won three various awards for his performance as Sheldon.  Amy is perfectly casted by Mayim Bialik.  She's better known for her role as Blossom in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blossom-Seasons-1-2/dp/B001GP5TMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blossom: Seasons 1 & 2</a>.

4539214,5,B0053O89WY,"I love the show.  I like the 5th season. I still watch it when I feel like a laugh.  I am a Chemist and can relate with the ""nerd ness"" of the show.  Anyone growing up and taking math and chemistry classes no's to well what it is like.  As a woman it was worse.  The adding women scientists adds to the appeal.",1369267200,,310,3.857142857142857

4539218,1,B0053O89WY,"TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes ""come out of the charecters."" I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how ""geeky"" they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion.",1369180800,3,1468,4.303249097472924

I am never disappointed when watching this show.  It is always so funny!  The package was delivered in a very reasonable time frame and was easy to track.

After so many years of the ""nerds"" being wedgied, dunked in toilets, mugged for lunch money and overlooked by the hot girls in favor of the muscleheads and drug dealers, The Big Bang Theory finally poo-poos in the face of all of that and shows us that, ""hey!,"" these brainiacs deserve a second chance to find sweet love, all while saying things that no one would ever say in ways that no one would ever speak.

This is, apparently, one of the most popular shows on major network television, and that alone should be telling of the fact that it aims real high for the lowest common denominator. Not a single character is likeable, the formulaic blueprint couldn't be any more appalling, and I'm pretty sure that the creator is the same creep who made the wafer-thin Two & A Half Men. Basically, that means ""skip the hell out of this.""

And then here, we have the complete fifth season. So, if you didn't blow your brains out after the first four, the Bazinga crew have been gracious enough to offer the viewer another chance.

Buy this if you want to lose friends or think that your 18 daily hours of level-grinding on World of Warcraft is a worthwhile endeavor. If your situation deviates in any way, just cultivate a personality and spend the cash you would've spent on this on a package of condoms, a bottle of cheap booze with a mixer, and some GHB instead. Honestly, going to prison for rape is better than watching this show. Scout's honor.

5th Season, just like all the others: .5/5 stars. Treat yourself with dignity and buy top-of-the-line ingredients to make yourself an amazing dinner.",1363564800,8,1611,4.583333333333333

At the same time I have seen all of season 5 episodes in prime time and, I have seen them again when they have been rerun.  I have watched the DVD for Season 1, 2, and I am part way through Season 3.  One thing you will appreciate is watching the shows without the commercial interruption.  You will also get the ""complete"" version on DVD compared to watching late night reruns on TV.  The DVD extras are an added bonus.  I had mentioned in a previous review that I identify somewhat with a bunch of professors who have a love (obsession) with popular culture.  In my day we taught Shakespeare and Chaucer, but we also went to conferences on Tolkien.  Incidentally the portrayal of academic politics and academic pettiness in some of the story lines seems to me to be pretty accurate.  All the characters are good for a laugh, but the best part to me is when Penny (the woman who is a few credits short of a community college degree) and Dr. Sheldon Cooper (who considers himself the smartest person in the world) interact.  Sometimes sparks will fly, and sometimes there are extraordinary moments.  Consider Penny and Sheldon doing ""Soft Kitty"" as a round.",1362355200,,1223,4.538812785388128

Thankfully, this year the picture quality on DVD is just as sharp as previous seasons.  Many other TV on DVD shows are cutting back on the video quality (to make Blu-Ray look even better by comparison?).  On Twitter they might advise that the cure for depression is a bowl of ice cream and an orgasm.  But we're on Amazon.

4539786,2,B0053O89WY,"I remember September 2007 being a great month for geek culture on TV. It saw the inception of shows such as ""Chuck"", ""Reaper"" (an ill fated show simply because the CW didn't know what to do with it), and a hillarious little sitcom about two insufferable nerds whose lives are upheaved when a simple, yet incredibly vivacious gal from the midwest moves across the hall. In subsequent seasons, they managed to keep the geek-centric formula firmly in place, yet allowing the characters to grow.

Fast forward to 2011/2012 which brought us a fifth season, and it barely resembles it's first four seasons. While there are a few classic moments here, it just isn't nearly what it once was. There are dozens of bawdy sitcoms riddling the airwaves these days. Most of which have no heart or inventive writing. It would seem to me that this show seems to be moving in that direction. Virtually gone are the inside physics jokes, nods to geek culture (comics, movies, video games) and in their place are the kind of plotlines and character development one would associate with shows like ""Two And A Half Men"". Characters like Amy (while amusing when initially introduced) have gone completely off the reservation into the realm of...well...creepy. What should have been a great recurring character has completely overstayed her welcome and has become the albatross to a show once sailing with agreeable wind and blue skies. Bernadette is yet another character that has overstayed her welcome. No matter how you sell it, I just can't buy Wolowitz's capacity to keep a girl like Bernadette and the longer he does...the less I buy it. Raj's quasi homosexual tendencies, while charming and inventive at first, have become old hat and are, well, rather dull. They really seem to have lost their grip on how to write Raj this season.

Leonard's prowess when it comes to the opposite sex has also taken a quantum leap into the realm of the absurd. Between Raj's incredibly gorgeous sister and his little run in with a very sexy comic book fan, I have to wonder how and when Leonard got all this ""game""! The Penny attraction, I get. He's basically the sweet guy next door in a world of men that have treated her badly (as she's constantly attracted to the worst sort of men there are). Now we are expected to believe that, as of season five, his awkwardness has all but gone and he's able to attract such INCREDIBLY beautiful women that would be (in reality) WAY out of his league. He's not a bad looking guy...but come on!!

What used to be something I looked forward to every week has become that kind of show that is easily dismissable.

Such a shame, because this was once one of the most inventive and original shows on the airwaves.",1361750400,7,2720,4.707983193277311

4540027,5,B0053O89WY,"So, yeah, I think this is how shows should be released, assuming the cost is equivalent to existing releases.

Blu-Ray + DVD + UltraViolet. And it looks like there are a fair number of ""bonus features"" on the set. So, yay for that! Always fun...

You get Blu-ray for your hi-def TV/Blu-ray setup (if/when you get one), you get DVD for backward compatibility with older DVD players and you get permanent UV copy for your online digital streaming library and don't get nickel'd & dimed for yet another (digital) release of the same content.

Makes sense to me. If movies & TV start getting released this way, either Blu+DVD+UV (preferred, if cost is equivalent) or Blu+ UV, I can tell I'll be buying a lot more. It just makes good economic sense. Kind of a 3-fer.

I like this kind of release and hope more studios get on board with it. I'll probably slant my buying habits toward this kind of release over releases that are ONLY one or the other, or barebones releases, etc. So, make it happen. Of course, in a decade, everything will probably be all-digital. But, until then. The combo pack + UV approach seems like the best of all worlds.

So far, it looks like only season 1, 2, & 5 of Big Bang Theory have been released this way, but not yet 3 & 4? *Sad panda.* Guess I'll hold off on season 3 & 4 until they get re-released under the new scheme. Make it happen, studio!",1360195200,,1373,4.389763779527559

4540182,5,B0053O89WY,"Sheldon (Jim Parsons) is brilliant at being a genius. His acting brilliance is genius. This show would be nothing without Penny (Kaley Cuoco). Her Nebraska charm and poignant facial expressions along with her comedic demeanor make this show. I love the theme of this show because it's about being entertaining without having to make a political statement or worry about being politically correct. It's just funny. It is the Andy Griffith's show of the new millennium. The casting director was almost perfect, the only sore spot is Leonard (Johnny Galecki) because he is irritating to watch. He kisses like a 4 year old, for being a supposed doctor in physics his idocy is ever apparant. No one could have that much education yet be that stupid. His acting is forced and lacking in believability. All in all a great show that you can watch over and over and still be entertaining.",1359417600,,879,4.827814569536423

I do not have cable/dish/Netflix to watch the episodes as they roll out so I do not know until the discs come out in May the following year. I would recommend grabbing this one and Sixth together since it stops and you want to know what is going to happen.

I love the episode when Sheldon can't get a haircut b/c his barber is in the hospital! I think that Howard is still funny, even though he is not a ""ladies man"" anymore - like he used to ""think"" he was; I think his relationship with Bernadette brings the story a new flare (the same thing can get old after a while). Penny and Leonard have to find out if they really should be together, Raj still cannot find a gf (no surprise) and has to deal with losing guy time with Howard, and Sheldon still doesn't understand Amy's thirst for affection.

If you like the other seasons of TBBT, there's no reason you shouldn't like this one!",1356566400,,759,4.382978723404255

I just realized that this review was posted on the item for the the entire DVD (not just the one for that particular episode). So do not read on if you are not caught up to the last episode of season 5.

----

This is a review of the last episode of season five, ""The Countdown Reflection.""

I thought this episode was very funny, and quite possibly the best one yet. Without giving anything away, this episode puts Howard's NASA aspirations in conflict with his upcoming wedding to Bernadette. Mixed in with the funny moments, there are also some very touching moments that should truly make you feel like you are there with the characters (assuming you have been watching the series consecutively up to this point).

This was a great ending to season five, and I highly recommend watching this episode (as well as the rest of this season).",1355788800,,849,4.602649006622516

This site is horrible and leads me to ask the question, why is Amazon trying to compete with iTunes?  They obviously have morons designing their site and this service!!!!

It now shows that we have downloaded 1 of 2 copies, but we haven't downloaded anything.  At this point I'm scared to select anything because it will tell me I've downloaded 2 of 2 and I will have spent nearly $40 on something that I will never see.

4542143,1,B0053O89WY,"The BBT is a horrible show.  With fake audience laughter, it is now the #1 Rank Show in the following Category:  Least Laughs Per Show.

The only reason why it is on is because $$$$$.  Listen, if you, or me, or your neighbor (the nice neighbor) had alot of $$, then we could keep any show on we wanted... as long as we kept writing the checks, they will still keep writing up unfunny dialogue, and horrible jokes.  I wonder, do they , when they write the script, do they insert the ""fake audience laugh"" into the script using the full description, or do they use an acronym, like FAL, or LB for Laugh Button.  It is so sad that we watch shows... we watch shows that have fake audience laughter sound bytes every 10 seconds...

I know it is a bot off topic, but I remember when I was growing up, when I was very small, like 9 years old... I think it was ABC that TGIF - with Full House , Perfect Strangers (??) and The Charmings.  I used to suck on my Jolly Rancher sticks (which they discontinued because when they reach a translucent, thin level it slices peoples tongues (or is capable of).  So now we can't buy them - we have to go to the jolly rancher website.  Anyway, I liked those shows, because I was 9 years old.  (Oh, and I remember ALf was Monday night ;-)).

My favorite (yes, I will be making a point, and then returning to bring together a nice closing that will highlight how poorly talented the writers are on big bang theory) show after school - THAT HAD LB (laugh button) was ""DIFFERENT STROKES.""  I loved this show.  One day, when I was 10... I noticed that after watching the entire show's 22 minutes... I did not laugh once.  The LB was pressed 190 times, but I did not laugh at all.  The next day after school the same events played out.

In closing, please understand that THE little bang theory is only on the air to promote the subliminal - the people paying for this wretched, not even close to being funny, embarrassing show do so because they want to instill within everyone's minds two things.

1.  They want to subliminally program millions of American minds to come to accept ""the chiity citty bang theory.""  Every time I write it build up, subliminally, an acceptance in your mind.  The reason why they do this is because they ave a plan to fake an alien invasion, and it involves trying to convince all religions that humans were created by aliens, etc... this way they can control everyone easier. (it is all about control and power)

2. They want to subliminally make you accept non-traditional relationships. (heter-o, rhymes with et phone home).  Hey, I don't have any issues with this one... who cares, people have different chemical make-ups, it as to be accepted.  The first one is deceptive though.

Finally, the next time you watch the unfunniest show in history, please try to focus on the laugh button... and ask yourself... is this funny?  What are they trying to get across here?

I think you just may be interested in the results.

And as a Computer and A/V tech, I can relate to people just like the characters in the show; but I do not, never have and never will find bathroom humor amusing in any form. Each and every show has at least one and usually more than one reference to bodily functions that I find unfunny and tedious.

4542342,3,B0053O89WY,"Over the past 2 years I have loved The Big Bang Theory, I currently own seasons 1-4 on DVD which were great (season 4 has its problems) but I have followed the show since I began watching it. Seasons 1-3 were probably one of the funniest episodes of the Big Bang Theory because the jokes were fresh, the characters were great the writing was clever and overall the show was original. I loved the dynamics of all the characters of these grown nerds that are intellectually gifted but socially disabled associating themeselves with a normal beautiful girl that is struggling to get by. What made the show so great in the first place was that it showed how opposites attract, a group of ""nerds"" are able to co-exist with a beautiful girl that under any other circumstance would have nothing to do with these kind of guys. I loved the show up until season 4, the formula that made it great, just took a dramatic shift, all of the characters changed with a couple of exceptions. The addition of Amy and Bernadette was okay in the beginning, mainly because it gave the characters of Sheldon and Howard more humanity having relations with a female comapanion which was a nice balance to the Leonard/Penny dynamic. I actually liked Amy and Bernadette in the beginnig, Amy is a female Sheldon which is a nice twist, and Bernadette is a sexy petite woman whose appeal is her bubbly personality. But once these female character became a part of the permanent cast, it turned out to be the biggest downfall to the show as a whole

When I was watching season 5's episodes, I just realized that we barely have moments where it's just the 4 guys (Sheldon/Leonard/Howard/Raj). Thats what annoyed me the most because the female dynamics were added to evolve the characters, but what it did was actually kill their personalities. Howard's charm completely dissolved this season, because his character has changed from the guy that hit on every woman possible, to being stuck to one woman which is Bernadette (I can't blame him though). Ultimately Howards character just isn't funny to me anymore, he may have his moments but his characters runs dry for me. Amy's character is also another character I have a problem with. In the beginning she is introduced as the female Sheldon, a genius whose wit and misunderstanding of human behavior matches Sheldon perfectly, but in this season, she is just the most annoying character in the show, I'm sorry to all the Amy fans but she gets on my last nerves. She tries too hard to fit in to the point that I don't even feel sorry that she is incapable of doing so, she has a relationship with Sheldon however she has an ambiguous fatal attraction towards Penny that was funny in Season 4, but now is just creepy. There is practially no bromance of Howard and Raj anymore which is what I actually missed the most, I missed the interactions between them which is almost non-existant in this season. Raj is also a character that is underused in the series, and ever since the arrival of Bernadette and Amy, his character in the show has bcome useless.

Sheldon is my personal favorite since the beginning seasons. Jim Parson's ability to recite extremely long dialogues with such agility and comedic timing is a true talent. His personality was a fresh of breath air when the show began, but something just clicked in my head that changed my perception of Sheldon's character this season. Sheldon was always known as the repulsive character whose too smart for his own good, which hasn't changed in Season 5, and that is precisely the problem. I guess after 4 seasons of Sheldon, I have met my ends meet with the character at this point. You would think Sheldon would have progressed and adjusted a little bit after having a girlfriend and befriending Penny for awhile now, but thats just not the case and I think thats the most frustrating thing. After watching this season, I think I am now fed up with the show, there's just nothing original or exciting about the show anymore. Sure it has it's funny moments here and there but it just wasn't what it used to be. I can tell that some of the storylines are forced and the writing has become stale. And maybe its just me, but I even noticed that some of the actors are starting to look disinterested during the show especially Johnny Galecki (Leonard), he's not as energetic as he used to be and his delivery lacks the urgency he once had in earlier seasons. The Big Bang Theory was once my favorite show, but I guess I have outgrowned it. If you're still a fan of the Big Bang Theory then by all means pick this DVD up, but as for me I'm returning this DVD to Target and I might just give up on the show all together. I have moved on to ""Community"" (THE funniest show on television)",1348099200,10,4754,4.585193889541715

4542360,5,B0053O89WY,"In response to ""Mskrisklark""s review stating the need to ""stick up for Star Trek"" fans....Im lost.....If anyone needs sticking up for in regards to this show in this context it's star wars fans. Theres really very little reference to it, esp. compared to Trek. I count, on average, some Star Trek reference once every two episodes or so. And every one is GLORIOUS. I am a huge Trek fan and hate star wars but it does also make sense....Star Trek is much more about science and scientific ideas than the fantasy-in-space long,long ago far away of star wars. From Nimoy to Spiner to Wheaton to Takei to Levar Burton {who I met recently}, this is cleary a Trek show!!!!

In regards to ssn 5 specifially there's no real dip in quality. The progression of the Sheldon/Amy relationship was interesting. The wedding was ok but there was nothing particulary compelling about it. Same for the howard as an astroaunt arc. It made sense in the progression of the series though.

In the end, a fine chapter to add to the Big Bang dvd collection. Really as good more or less than any of the other seasons with plenty of stand out moments.",1347408000,,1125,4.592039800995025
4542361,4,B0053O89WY,"As a ""Star Wars"" & ""Indiana Jones"" fan I was a late bloomer to the show.  Started watching it when the repeats started airing in 2011.  My favorite episode is in season 4 what I call ""the Raiders"" episode.

The 5th season is good, but NOT nearly the best.  I consider the 4th season the best.

As a ""Star Wars"" & ""Indiana Jones"" fan I want to know why not one actor from any of those films have been on.

2 favorite episodes in season 5:  episode 19 ""The Weekend Vortex"" & 20 ""The Transporter Malfunction"".

Now, I am going to stick up for ""Star Trek"" fans here.  Episode 5 ""The Russian Rocket Reaction"" is another Wil Wheaton episode BUT the blu ray/DVD package does not mention Brent Spiner.  And, of course episode 20.  Leonard Nimoy has been mentioned in more than one episode in the series, my favorite when Penny gives Sheldon the autographed napkin.  So, having him do the voice of the ""Spock"" action figure was great.  BUT, he got NO MENTION in the credits or the blu ray/DVD episode list like Spiner.

I did feel the season finale about the wedding was a let down.  You normally get surprises in finales & season openers, so episode 1 of season 6 should be fantastic to make up for the ""no surprises"" season 5 finale.

Normal, good extras in the packages.

You have 2 blu ray disc & 3 DVD disc in this.

Looking forward to season 6.",1347408000,2,1341,4.317269076305221

Despite seeing it every week while I was at the gym, I had ZERO interest in this show.
So, no, I wasn't really a fan.
Until one day in June of this year, when my 15 year old daughter was at home and got sucked into a black hole of a Big Bang Theory marathon.  When I got home from work, she said, ""Mom, you've GOT to see this show!""  Since I couldn't find my own go-to, unwind after a long day show, Spongebob Squarepants, on at the time, I sat down and did.
It just so happened to be the Einstein Approximation, the episode where Sheldon gets lost in the ball pit and Leonard tries to catch him.
I was hooked from then on.

Bernadette and Amy really add a whole wonderful level to the show. The 5th season has big name guest stars such as Wil Wheaton, Brent Spiner, and Leonard Nimoy !",1340150400,6,329,4.238095238095238
4542534,3,B0053O89WY,"SPOILER ALERT! Do not read on if you wish not to know any climax or revelation of the season!

First off, I have never written a review on anything but am someone who has been a true fan of the series and am frightened at where the series is headed.  I have seen the first 4 seasons at least 25 times and still watch them regularly.  I have also seen the entire 5th season numerous times.  I am still a true fan I will continue to watch, however I feel the show is being more adapted to the general public with the need for a romance factor and aligning with mainstream ideas.

I would like to look back at the first season when the physics jokes were written with much more wit.  The writing was phenomenal!  With myself having a physics minor I understood them clearly; some others in the room did not understand many of the jokes yet they also found them funny simply because they did not get it. It is a bit of a paradox: both funny understood and funny not understood.

Though Sheldon may be considered the main character, Penny is the key to the show.  What would the Big Bang Theory equation be without the girl across the hall?  Penny's character is both necessary and applauded.  However the other girlfriends in the show have been given too much importance.  I do at ""some times"" enjoy the characters of Bernadette and Amy but wish they did not have relationships with their ""boyfriends!""  I thought the premise of the show was that the nerds know nothing about women and are unable to pursue a relationship.  Yet they now all have one, except Raj of course.  I understand a show needing character evolution and the evolution of relationships to prevent something from becoming repetitive.  But is it really necessary for every character to be paired with a girl when the the premise of the show was the opposite. Especially Sheldon! Who has no need for a physical or emotional relationship since he is of course a ""robot!""

At the end of the season when they showed the three couples holding hands at the end it was a complete and utter disappointment for me.  I remember no point in the first 3 seasons that the writers were pulling at heart strings to gain ratings.

I wish the gain no disrespect towards the actors, writers, or producers because in all they have done a job well done and have given me a show that I can repeat word for word as well as adore.  I just ask that they just please revert back to the the original ideas.

To break it all down the series was just simply funnier when:

Raj did not have a drink in his hand whenever they felt it was necessary for him to talk!
Howard was CREEPY and not ""sentimental"", and definitely not married!
Leonard had no experience with women!
SHELDON DID NOT AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT A GIRLFRIEND!!!
And Penny... well I guess shes just always been perfect for this show!

In my revision I seem to be a Penny fanatic, yet the funny thing is that I am not. The truth is that she has been the only consistent character in the series and I wish I could say the same for the others!",1340150400,35,3037,4.374331550802139

4542680,4,B0053O89WY,"Seasons 1-3 were unbelievably funny, hands down 5 stars.  They had me a bit worried at the beginning of season 4, but everything took off nicely and it came on strong to earn 5 stars.  As for season 5, while this is still one of the funniest, if not the funniest show on TV right now, it's simply not as funny.  I will say, just about the time I'm thinking maybe a particular episode is not ""making it,"" something happens or is said that makes me laugh out loud and saves it.

I use to find Howard and Raj very funny, now I find them a bit pathetic.  It may be that they've always been a bit pathetic but the show was just so fast paced and funny that I didn't notice that much.  I do believe they moved much too quickly into the Howard and Bernadette wedding/marriage thing.  It may just be me, but the Penny and Leonard characters seem, at times, to be just going through the motions . . . a bit distant or disconnected (I blame the writers and director, not the actors).  Sheldon seems to have put on a pound or two; his face and neck seem much fuller.  It may be that the very, very successful and award winning actor playing the part is now living the good life a bit.  It seems to change the character a bit; it seems to give his facial expressions (which have always been hilarious) less impact.  All and all, it's still a very funny show.

Edit May 3, 2012:  Interestingly, tonight's episode (the day after my posting above) was quite good and very funny.  Another episode this good, and I'll have to go to 4 1/2 stars. ;-)

Edit August 20, 2012:  Well, with all things said and done, I give the 5th Season 4 1/2 stars without reservation!  They've got everything in place to have a 5 Star 6th Season, I really hope they pull it off.  I've grown very fond of the characters in the show.  Good luck on making the 6th Season another winner.

Edit January 13, 2013:  The 6th Season is very interesting.  I do believe the ""gals"" are stealing the show.  For me the funniest scenes have been those involving the girls.  The episode a few nights ago had me laughing out loud when the ""gals"" found themselves arguing over the Hammer of Thor . . . funny stuff.",1335916800,5,2159,4.2481572481572485

4542760,5,B0053O89WY,"I am writing my review now, since we are 3/4 through the 5th season of my favorite sitcom. I will update once it wraps. I don't understand why people never want anything to change, especially with the Big Bang Theory. The whole premise of the show is the four geeky guys learning about the world of girls and dating--their universe is expanding, hence the title ""The Big Bang Theory."" There is only so much you can do with 5 people and if they never did anything except sit around and play video games and Klingon Boggle then it would get extremely BORING and everyone would be complaining that the show needs to take on a new direction and add new characters. You would really want to see 5+ seasons of Howard being a perv and all the others failing at life? That's not funny, that's sad! Amy and Bernadette aren't going anywhere anytime soon, so deal with it.

Anyway, this season opens up with the aftermath of Raj and Penny's night together, and it isn't what everybody automatically assumed it was, which ""ruined"" the show. And even Sheldon decides to take his friendship with Amy to the next level, by offering to be her boyfriend (with strict rules and guidelines that guarantees that nothing changes physically). Howard gets a chance to go into outer space, and when he goes to training camp, we have hysterical (and disgusting) results. And Leonard finally breaks up with Raj's sister Priya, which I am happy about because she wasn't really nice. The only thing I'm concerned about is Penny drinking a lot.

This season we also had the 100th episode. I thought it was pretty funny, and some other people thought it was so ""disappointing.""

A few of my favorite episodes this season are ""The Infestation Hypothesis,"" ""The Good Guy Fluctuation,"" ""The Rhinitis Revelation,"" ""The Shiny Trinket Manuever,"" ""The Werewolf Transformation,"" ""The Launch Acceleration,"" ""The Countdown Reflection"" and ""The Weekend Vortex.""

6/13/12 Edit: The season finished on a high note with Howard getting married to Bernadette on the roof of the apartment, on the same morning as Google Earth does their satellite image, so they have their wedding captured on Google Earth. And a few days after, he took off to outer space. While everybody was watching the launch on TV, they all grabbed each other's hands. And SHELDON grabbed AMY'S hand. That shows how much he's grown in 5 years. I don't get why people have such a problem with that when it is SUPPOSED to happen.

The show has been renewed through season 7, so they must be doing something right.

4.5/5 for me! :)",1332028800,22,2554,4.753950338600451

To be honest I wasn't expecting much out of the program when it first aired; but my son who is a Physics major wanted to watch it.  He enjoys the nerdiness of the show; I on the other hand I am at times intrigued with the flip flopping and social dynamics between the nerds and the supposed ""socially normal"" characters.  In the first seasons they focused more on introducing physics theories in a back door way to the general public.  For me the earlier episodes were the best ones, but as with any series, there has to be evolution, both good and bad or the series goes stale and shrivels up.

4542888,5,B0053O89WY,"In the cult tradition of SPARTACUS, the halls of every science department now echoes: ""I AM SHELDON""!

Currently into its fifth season, THE BIG BANG THEORY proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down form its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of FRASIER and SEINFELD - and BIG BANG is **consistently** brilliant!

Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.
His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually confused girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, (which Sheldon finally claimed) received a far more enlarged role this fifth season. However, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.

Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to ""help"" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.
Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship this season with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems to be gravitating back towards Penny once more.

Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer (whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution), he also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).
The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.
Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by his fiance, Bernadette, who is very likeable, but also is cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.

Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He keeps using the ""poor Indian"" defense although his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley. His character, even in the fifth season, remains underdeveloped.

Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.
One of the best fifth season moments: slipping in the ""Who is the greatest?"" cheer between Sheldon's patented knock of repeated ""Penny!"".

The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!

The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?

4542890,5,B0053O89WY,"Amy and Bernadette are great additions to the gang and it's great to see more of them, especially Amy with Sheldon. Greatly entertaining season, much like the other 4. Thank you, Bill Prady and the team of writers.",1320451200,4,214,4.657894736842105
4542891,4,B0053O89WY,I was a little disappointed that they started this season off with a crude sexual humor episode but the season did bounce back with their usual superior entertainment by season end. The one star deduction is for the starting episode.,1320105600,11,233,4.85
4542892,5,B0053O89WY,"I've thoroughly enjoyed the series. It has a clever script, a great cast, and I'm hooked. I'm particularly amused by the dialogue between the separate characters. This is a unique series that will be remembered for all time.",1319846400,28,224,4.921052631578948

All a matter of taste ... but we tossed this particular buy as we didn't want it as part of our video library!!!  Not at all Amazon's fault ... the delivery was excellent ... the content was just not our cup of tea, so to speck!!",1526601600,,400,4.102564102564102
