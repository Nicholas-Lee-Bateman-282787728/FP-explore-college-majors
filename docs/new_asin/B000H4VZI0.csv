8136295,5,B000H4VZI0,"This 2006 Harnoncourt/Zurich DVD is one modern production of a Mozart opera that is acceptable, unlike the outrageous 2006 Salzburg stagings of the M-22 festival. Harnoncourt leads a large orchestra with his usual robustness.
It's worth comparing it with the sweeter 1988&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arnold-Ostman-Drottningholm/dp/B001URA65Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arnold Ostman/Drottningholm</a>&nbsp;DVD -- with a smaller orchestra, but better preserving the sense of Mozartian 18th c. buffa.

Director Tobias Moretti uses a simple, but clever, decor. The constant inventive comic acting preserves the sense of buffa.
With no real change of scenery, the constant stage jokes and intense facial expressions, well captured by close shots, project well the variety of feelings.
The ""giardiniera"" atmosphere is symbolically preserved with a few plant-pots and  loose branches around the stage. It's meager, but enough to project the image of the pseudo garden-girl.

- Christoph Strehl, as Contino, with his long blond hair and lanky frame, pulls off, with smoothness and spacy nonchalance, a most enjoyable and funny interpretation of his dopy character,.
- Eva Mei retains the artistocratic elegance of Sandrina, with a certain aloofness difficult to believe in a low-class garden-girl. However, lovely singing by the central couple of lovers, Sandrina and Contino.
- And Isabel Rey is a great Arminda, projecting the energy and no-nonsense of the girl who wants her count, but has no illusion about his faithfulness. She delivers her ""tour-de-force"" No. 13 aria, 'Vorrei Punirti Indegno', in high heels on top of a table, without tripping, a tribute to her fitness.
- Liliana Nikiteanu has a large voice, but her small physical size is not right for the part, especially when she has to constantly confront the rebuffs of the energetic Arminda.
- The role of Serpetta, the malicious and self-centered soubrette, is marvelously played by Julia Kleiter. She has a lovely, powerful voice, a beautiful young face and an energetic body, and shows an excellent comic sense. Her close shots are remarkable in the variety of expressions. She is the vibrant discovery of this cast, and often steals the show. The scene XIV in act II where she climbs up her ladder while singing her great No. 20 aria ""Chi Vuol Godere Il Mondo"", just before the forest scene, is exciting.
- Gabriel Bermudez, as Nardo, is tall, remarkably good-looking, and has boundless energy. He is looking less of a fool than in the Drottningholm version.
- We may feel that Rudolf Schasching, as Podesta, is shouting a bit too much, but his large physique, very adroitly used, justifies his voluminous voice. Compare with the more restrained and aristocratic, but equally effective, Podesta in the Drottningholm production.

Both versions, Harnoncourt/Zurich and Ostman/Drottningholm, are delightful, but strikingly different.
- One modern, with bare ultrabright spartan decor without any colors, but where constant comic acting and beautiful singing make us forget that this is no authentic Mozart atmosphere.
- The other quaint, charming, far more authentic in retaining Mozart's elegance and graciousness in period costumes and scenery, and better adapted to the exuberant buffa of the 18th c. spirit.
Still, both versions are excellent, wonderful entertainment, and deserve the attention of any lover of Mozart operas. Since the 2006 Salzburg M-22 production is not in the same class, both versions have no competition in the DVD library.

""LA FINTA GIARDINIERA"" OFFERS A COMPLEX PLOT, RICH IN DRAMATIC SURPRISES

The libretto is a marvelous classic, as it incorporates most of the essential features of traditional ""opera buffa"" up to the time of Mozart.

The story is a non-stop series of surprises, highly dramatic, and, when well acted, extremely entertaining.
- A murder attempt: Count Belfiore (""Contino"") has previously stabbed Marquise Violante Onesti in a fit of jealousy and has fled, leaving her for dead.
- The action revolves around the faithfulness of Violante: she goes around looking for her past lover, under the name of ""Sandrina"". She rejects other advances, especially that of her new employer, the mayor ""Podesta"".
- This is a game of false indentities: Violante wants to remain incognito under her disguise of Sandrina, the garden-girl, accompanied by her servant, ""Nardo"".
- There is a thwarted marriage: between society figure ""Arminda"", Podesta's niece, and the stranger, Count Belfiore (""Contino""). This society wedding is the central focus at the start of the opera.
- There's a pre-trial instruction scene: Belfiore, accused of murder, must answer questions from Podesta before any marriage can take place.
- There is violence and kidnapping: Sandrina is abducted by Arminda and abandoned in a wild forest full of strange beasts.
- There are scenes of total confusion: All the characters go on the search for Sandrina in the dark forest, and form pairs under mistaken beliefs of identity.
- There's also authentic madness: Both Sandrina and Belfiore are overwhelmed by the complexity of their fates and lose their minds.
- There's general reconciliation and final happiness, except for Podesta.

The engine of the action is three love relationships that extend into triangles
All feelings are involved: love, jealousy, faithfulness, forgiveness, pardon, reconciliation, class superiority, social hierarchies, astonishment, madness, mismatched pairings, joy and ecstacy.
Mozart has to give expression to all the feelings and frame the series of irrational events in brilliant music that lasts more than 3h 15'. He succeeds unfailingly.

A FUN STORY

As in good ""opera buffa"", the libretto unfolds an incredible, succession of extraordinary surprises, beyond all common sense and rationality, each one amazing and amusing. All is happening at fast pace, keeping the action on a high pitch. The text is full of humor and irony. It is a farce of the highest style, a masterpiece of the genre. All the scenes are interesting, the text often hilarious, and never taken seriously.

Mozart must have been delighted with this libretto. It provides a marvelous opportunity for the musician to express a wide range of emotions mixing the dramatic and the comic. The lightness of the writer's touch allows Mozart to use the speed and energy of his syncopated music to best effect, combined with touches of the grandiose style, a mastery he had just demonstrated in his brilliant ""opera serias"" such as ""Mitridate"" and ""Lucio Silla"".

The libretto is inspired by Goldoni's and Piccinni's ""La buona figliuola"" (1760), an example of the ""comdie larmoyante"" focused on feminine sensibility made fashionable by Samuel Richardson's European best seller, ""Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded"" (1740). A humble, virtuous, young woman goes through hardships, harassments, and temptations, only to be, at the end of her adventures, revealed to be an aristocrat. In both Piccinni's and Mozart's libretti, the virtuous lady is disguised (""finta"") as a gardener (""giardiniera"").

But the ""poet"" of the libretto, Petrosellini, added a series of sensational, even insane, surprises to graft the old ""buffa"" style on the new genre of sentimental comedy. The comic absurdity of the events and mistaken identities is taken in stride for the sheer fun of it, as it will also in ""Cosi fan tutte"". It is, at bottom, no more absurd than the fairy-tale plots that defy common sense in ""The Magic Flute"" or Puccini's ""Turandot"".

Pasquale Anfossi had set the same libretto just a year before, 1774, in a classical ""buffa"" style with sharply defined characters. Mozart changed the coloration of the piece by making his characters more complex, and the action more dramatic.

NUMBERS & ARIAS

I am using some illuminating quotes from Hermann Abert's monumental&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/W-A-MOZART/dp/0300072236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">W.A. MOZART</a>&nbsp;(1919, transl. 2007)

Note that Harnoncourt, here also, cuts out recitatives, plus three arias, No. 16 'Una Voce Sento Al Core' (Sandrina), No. 18 'Dolce D'Amor Compagna Speranza' (Ramiro), and No. 25 'Mio Padrone, Io Dir Volevo' (Podesta).

The original score has 28 numbers
4 ensembles No. 1, No. 12, No. 23, No. 28, one at the beginning, and another at the end of each act, including the final chorus to end the opera.
1 1/2 duets No. 24b, No. 27, both between the lovers Sandrina/Contino

22 1/2 arias for 7 characters
Sandrina - 5 arias - No. 4, No. 11, No. 16, No. 21, No. 22 (""mezzo carattere"", mi-buffa, mi-seria)
Contino - 4 arias - No. 6, No. 8, No. 15, No. 19 (""mezzo carattere"")
Ramiro - 3 arias - No. 2, No. 18, No. 26 (""seria"")
Podesta - 3 arias - No. 3, No. 17, No. 25 (""buffa"")
Nardo - 3 arias - No. 5, No. 9b, No. 14, No. 24a (""buffa"")
Serpetta - 2  arias - No. 9a, No. 10, No. 20 (""buffa"")
Arminda - 2 arias - No. 7, No. 13 ((""mezzo carattere"")

Sandrina has the lion's share of the singing. She gets 5 arias, and shares the 2 duets with the Contino. The Contino has 4 arias, and is the other part in the 2 duets. Ramiro, Nardo, Podesta, have each 3 arias. Serpetta has 2  arias, and Arminda is given only 2 arias. But she sings the most grandiose of them all, No. 13.
In addition there are four ensembles. Those ending Act I and II are particularly long: 15' and 16' respectively. Which is where Mozart displays his extraordinary talent for choreographing the mingling and intertwining music for 7 singers accompanied by a rich invention of orchestral themes and interjections.

ACT I

No. 1: Ensemble ""Che lieto giorno"" (Sandrina, Serpetta, Ramiro, Il Podesta, Nardo)

What a lovely day!

[The initial ensemble is sung by only 5 of the 7 characters -- keeping Contino and Arminda in reserve for their grand entrance. Each sings one aria in turn, until all 5 are presented individually.
Ramiro is unhappy as his love for Arminda is not returned. Podesta rejoices that Sandrina will marry him. Sandrina is miserable, and will remain so until the end. Nardo resents Serpette for her indifference. Serpetta resents the arrival of Sandrina and Nardo, and laments Podesta's infatuation with Sandrina, concluding that all men are false. Podesta rejoices for the wedding of his niece Arminda with high nobility.
This becomes an excellent introduction to the plot. ""Mozart moves with great assurance and with an unmistakable sense of dramatic purpose"", even if the characters are presented one by one, rather than in the spirited ensemble that Mozart can already muster, and will later prefer.]

No. 2: Aria ""Se l'augellin sen fugge"" (Ramiro)

[Podesta has consoled Ramiro that, if Arminda does not love him anymore, nothing to worry, he will find another woman.]

Like a bird who has escaped from the cage, and cannot be returning, the idea of another capture terrifies me.

[Sentimental unhappy lovers are ""figures of fun"" in ""buffa"". For Mozart, the role of Ramiro is ""entirely serious"", who even becomes agitated when he fears ""l'idea d'un altro laccio/Ah che tremar mi fa"" (The idea of another trap/How it makes me tremble.)]

No. 3: Aria ""Dentro il mio petto io sento"" (Il Podesta)

[Podesta has fallen in love with his beautiful new garden-girl, the ""finta giardiniera"", and decides he wants to marry her. He wants to declare his love to her, but Serpetta keeps interfering.]

My heart is hearing an orchestra playing. First, the sweetness of flutes and oboes. Then the strings which start troubling the atmosphere. Finally the winds and drums bring me to despair.

[A classic ""buffa"" trick: At each mention of an instrument, the same one in the orchestra responds to him. Podesta is a true buffo part, usually a bass, as Don Cassandro was in ""Le Finta Semplice"". Here he becomes a tenor.]

No. 4: Aria ""Noi donne poverine"" (Sandrina)

[She's reminded her servant Nardo of her plight: The previous year, her lover Contino Belfiore had stabbed her in a jealous fit, and fled, leaving her for dead. Her only desire is to find him again. She does not want the troubles and unrequited attentions of a new lover like Podesta, and prefers to go away.]

We, sad women, are subjected to mens' tormenting advances.

No. 5: Aria ""A forza di martelli"" (Nardo)

[He complains about his predicament. He is trying to win Serpetta's affections, but but she avoids him and averts his gaze. Her heart is harder than iron or stone.]

The force of hammers can forge iron, chisels can carve marble. But nothing can tame the heart of a woman. Men are fools to chase women, they play games.

[Nardo's first aria. He has a mixed role. On one hand, he is ""the infatuated simpleton who pursues Serpetta in spite of all the rebuffs."" But he also has a genuine side betraying ""real spirit"".]

No. 6: Aria ""Che belta, che leggiadria"" (Il Contino)

[Contino has arrived in a carriage in preparation for his wedding to Arminda. He is a ""generous cavalier, always in thrall to more than one woman at once. As a perfect gentleman, he begins by praising Arminda's beauty.""]

What beauty, what charm. You are the sun, and your rays make me stagger.

[This entry is not very comic. Belfiore ""strikes a note of manly ardour that occasionally anticipates Belmonte"" in ""Entfhrung.""]

No. 7: Aria ""Si promette facilmente"" (Arminda)

[Arminda is not easily convinced or duped.]

Promises are too easy nowadays, that men talk simple women into swallowing to make them say ""yes"". But I am not of the same kind, I want clear agreements before saying ""yes"". Everything has to be all right. Contino, you are my life, my expectations. But should you cheat, as is the current custom, I will wreak vengeance with my own hands.

[Her first aria does not give her a contrasted characterization. She is ""as agitated as she is cunning"", and, although an aristocrat, ""lapses into the tone of an artful chambermaid"", halfway between ""seria"" and ""buffa"".]

No. 8: Aria ""Da Scirocco a Tramontana"" (Contino)

[To Podesta, Contino vaunts his own beauty, his merits, his military prowess, but he's become a prisoner of Armida's beauty. He's left all his grand world for her. Podesta laughs at this.]

From the south to the north, I have grand estates, my grand lineage goes back to Roman consuls and emperors.

[This is a real buffo motif: boasting of his grand ""aristocratic accomplishments told with pompous conceit.""]

No. 9a: Cavatina ""Un marito, oh Dio,vorrei"" (Serpetta)

[She is unhappy, harassed by Arminda's demands. She wants to avoid the sighs of Nardo]

I would want a husband who's loving, but not an aging one.

[Serpetta is another authentic ""buffa"" part. ""Like the rest of her kind, Serpetta is an out-and-out egoist, malicious, and spiteful, aiming her sights at Podesta, like Serpina in the intermezzo ""La Serva Padrona"" by Giovanni Pergolesi (Naples, 1733).]

No. 9b: Cavatina ""Un marito, oh Dio, vorresti"" (Nardo)

[Nardo answers Serpetta in the same style.]

You would want a loving husband. But a young one would not be right for you.

No. 10: Aria ""Appena mi vedon"" (Serpetta)

[She's told Nardo again that she has no feelings for him, but he does not get the message. See, she has no problem finding lovers.]

As soon as men see me, they flock to me, admiring my charms, and swearing eternal love. I play the modest one, answer nothing, and let them go by.

[Serpetta's charming second aria. She professes her policy of disguising her true character, and presenting only a ""charming, mischievous exterior.""]

No. 11: Cavatina 'Geme La Tortorella' (Sandrina)

[The orchestra describes the dove's cooing in ""a moving and genuinely Mozartian mixture of charm and melancholy.""]

The turtle dove sighs when away from her mate, she laments and hopes to excite pity.

No. 12: Finale of Act I 'Numi! Che Incanto E Questo' (Contino, Sandrina, Arminda, Ramiro, Podesta, Serpetta, Nardo) 15' 09""

[Arminda announces to Sandrina that today she is marrying the Contino. Sandrina, in shock, faints. The Contino arrives and proposes to help.]

Gods, what magic is this?

[Complex action follows in multiple sections.]

Contino, in ""an impassioned accompagnato"", approaches Sandrina and recognizes her features, her voice. Sandrina recovers, sees the Contino, and recognizes him. ""A motif of whimpering fear"" is mixed with ""hurried interjections"".
Ramiro enters with Arminda and presses his suit. Both couples are confused. Each character expresses his/her emotional crisis, all starting ""with the same melodic line"", ending with a 4-voice ensemble ""with words broken up by rests"" while ""the oboes intone a sustained lament.""
Podesta now enters ""to the emotionally charged sound of the horns"" and asks for an explanation. They answer in a chorus. Podesta is left alone, wondering and raging, ""Che tratto e questo"", what's going on?
He is stopped by Serpetta who fuels his jealousy by telling him that the ""giardiniera"" is making love with the Count in the garden. Nardo warns Podesta that Serpetta is lying.
Sandrina reproaches his cruelty to Contino, who kneels asking for her pardon. But Sandrina claims that she is only repeating what Violante said before dying, and tries to convince Contino that she is not his former lover. As Contino is kneeling to Sandrina, he is discovered by all.
Arminda, ""in an ironical outburst"", is angry at the fecklessness of her intended spouse. Ramiro eggs her on. Contino is at a loss, torn between his two loves. They all express together their irony, anger, fury, or, for Serpetta and Nardo, their secret satisfaction, at the duplicity of the count and Sandrina.

[Abert, always stingy with his praise, notes that this finale, in one section, ""is a masterpiece of characterization and of gripping tension"" and of orchestral expression. ""Only rarely did Italian composers produce anything as good as this.""]

ACT II

No. 13: Aria 'Vorrei Punirti Indegno' (Arminda)

[Contino has expressed his predicament. Since he's spotted Violante's features in Sandrina, he is desperate and wants to find her back. Arminda has noticed his agitation, and explodes in a fit of high-flown anger at his betraying her on their wedding day.]

I want to punish you, unworthy man, I want to tear you heart out, but my love holds me back. I feel both anger and compassion for you.

[Arminda's second aria, ""she is entirely the offended aristocrat thirsting for vengeance."" Not a trace of parody. It is a grand aria, fit for the most majestic ""opera seria"". ""It is a typically Mozartian G minor movement in all its bitter passion, seething with disquiet,"" compounded with Mozart's own sense of seriousness. In expressions of anger and fury, Mozart easily reaches the most sublime heights of passion.]

No. 14: Aria 'Con Un Vezzo All' Italiana' (Nardo)

[Nardo keeps pursuing Serpetta. She tells him to back off. But she may have nicer feelings if he sings her a passionate love song that could impress her.]

In the sweet Italian style, I say that you set my heart on fire, then I'll say it in French style, then in English style, but nothing pleases Serpetta.

[Nardo's second aria shows him as being more than a stupid buffo servant.]

No. 15: Aria 'Care Pupille' (Contino)

[Contino is persuaded that Sandrina is Violante. She tries to dissuade him by pretending she knows the story from Violante who has died and told her about his murderous behavior. Contino is transfixed by the resemblance.]

Dear beautiful eyes, look at me [but Serpetta refuses, and motions him to leave] Before leaving, I'd love to kiss your hand, as a sign of his love.

[But Podesta, unobserved, has stepped to Sandrina's side, and Contino, kisses his hand instead.]

Disaster, this is my bad luck.

[""The vain fop reverts to his former role as a lover."" He shows ""far greater sincerity than towards Arminda...in an aria full of real emotional depth"". The comic ending results from the acting on stage.]

No. 16: Aria 'Una Voce Sento Al Core' (Sandrina) [MISSING]

[Podesta renews his pursuit, confesses his love, and asks Sandrina to go with him. She does not want to, ""Perche non voglio"". Podesta is indignant, she is just a lowly servant. She resents his lack of respect for her feelings. She begs him to forgive her flight of temper.]

I hear a voice in my heart telling me that, behind you scornful mien, Podesta is full of compassion for me. But you rudeness hurts me. Young women who hear my plea should try to console me.

[The second section of her unhappiness ""strikes a profoundly tragic note"" with no intention of parody, ""a sudden outburst of heightened emotion...meant to be taken seriously.]

No. 17: Aria 'Una Damina, Una Nipote' (Podesta)

[Arminda still wants to marry Contino. Ramiro announces the receipt of an order to pass on to Podesta for the arrest of Contino Belfiore who is accused of murder. Ramiro is secretly delighted. Podesta postpones the wedding, since, if Contino is guilty, Podesta does not want him to marry his niece.]

This young lady, my niece, with beauty and standing, I cannot plunge her into misfortune. My good name would be ridiculed by all in Germany, in France, Spain. Don't even think of it. This will not happen.

[Podesta's second aria. He sings the affront to his social status and dignity.]

No. 18: Aria 'Dolce D'Amor Compagna Speranza' (Ramiro) [MISSING]

[He tries to engage Arminda in sweet talk, but she cuts him short. She is burning with contempt for him.]

Sweet companion of love, flattering hope is giving me strength and comfort, and sustains my life.

[Ramiro's second aria expresses ""the tenderness typical of all such lyrical youths"", with a coloratura flourish that does not belong to ""buffa"".]

No. 19: Recitativo 'Ah non partir...m'ascolta', and No. 19 aria `Gia divento freddo, freddo' (Contino)

[Contino arrives for the wedding. He is questioned by Podesta, and accused of murder. Contino blabbers, it was love, jealousy, an accident. Arminda is disgusted by his idiocy. The rapid-fire interrogation animates this secco recitative and the play of the orchestra's basses.
It is Sandrina who saves him by revealing she is marquise Violante, to everyone's stupefaction.
Podesta leaves, in despair at losing his Sandrina. Arminda also leaves, to prepare her revenge.
Contino, in his joy, wants to kiss Sandrina's hand. But Sandrina defuses Contino's enthusiasm by claiming she used her resemblance by pretending to be Violante only to save him. He should run to his great love, Arminda.]

Ah do not leave...listen to me. She rejects me, the earth is moving, a fog engulfs me. Is this a storm? Is it day or night? Do you want me to die? Are you crying? What for? Lightning is striking. Only heaven can save me. All should weep, I am dying. A mortal cold is invading me. But wait, I feel a light breeze, I can see the sun shining, I am still alive, and joy and hope are revived.

[Mad characters in ""buffa"" are comic figures used to parody ""seria"". Mozart starts with an ""emphatically tragic note"" in the recitative, but the orchestra teeming with ""motifs constantly and importunately changing, betrays a sense of parody"" accentuated by thunder and lightning on the stage. Contino ends with a ""homely expression to the joy felt at recovering from madness"" which ""incorporates ""buffa"" elements.""]

No. 20: Aria 'Chi Vuol Godere Il Mondo' (Serpetta)

[Nardo cannot find Sandrina. Serpetta announces Sandrina is gone. Podesta orders a search to be launched, even though it's already night. Serpetta reveals that Sandrina has been abducted by Arminda and abandoned in a dark forest full of ravenous beasts, where perhaps a hungry wolf will devour her. Serpetta is sorry, but Sandrina did ask for it. Serpetta must be political, hide her feelings and use pretense in playing the game of love.]

Who wants to enjoy the world must take it as it comes. A girl should be sincere and gay, but it's of no use with men today. Better be shy and indifferent, and make them wait. This is the lesson my mother taught me.

[Serpetta's third and last aria, continuing with exposing her policy of being ""political"", and the need to project feigned feelings and use secrecy if a poor girl is to reach her goals.]

No. 21: Aria 'Crudeli, oh Dio! Fermate' (Sandrina)

[Obscure silhouettes are seen disappearing in a deserted place, after Sandrina has been left in a grotto.]

Oh God! Stop, you cruel people. You have abandoned and left me all alone among those rocks.

[Mozart resorts to classical ""opera seria"", with an ""emotionally charged lamento scene, with a wildly impassioned motif in the violins"". In the ""agitated turmoil in the orchestra"" the voice is ""confined to declamatory phrases,"" expressing ""the indignant despair of a tragic heroine, with the desire for vengeance."" Sandrina ""suddenly grows in stature and becomes a heroine in the grand tradition.""]

No. 22: Cavatina 'Ah dal Pianto, dal Singhiozzo' (Sandrina)

Ah, with my crying and sighing, I can barely breathe. My grief is overwhelming, my spirit is fading.

[Same sense of ""disquiet in the orchestra, declamatory writing in the vocal line, and heightened emotion."" Sandrina ""descends into a state of utter hopelessness."" The ""sustained note of seriousness"" leaves the world of ""opera buffa"". The part was written for Rosa Manservici, an actress/singer of high repute.]

No. 23: Finale of Act II 'Fra Quest' Ombre, O Questo Scuro' (Contino, Sandrina, Arminda, Ramiro, Podesta, Serpetta, Nardo) 16' 16""

[In the darkness of the forest, everybody appears: First Nardo and Contino, then Arminda checking on Contino, then Podesta and Serpetta, and finally Ramiro, each with different intents. They all hear indistinct noises.]

In these shadows, in this darkness...

[Complex action ensues in long sections during the lengthy ensemble, with pairings of mistaken identities in the dark forest.]

Podesta grabs Arminda, believing her to be Sandrina, while Arminda believes him to be Contino.
Contino grabs Serpetta, believing her to be Sandrina, while Serpetta believes him to be Podesta.
Nardo finds Sandrina and recognizes her, as Sandrina also recognizes him, and believes herself saved.
The confusion continues, until Ramiro and a group of torches arrives.
Ramiro enjoys the moment. They all recognize their errors.
Arminda rages at Contino; Podesta rages at Sandrina; Nardo and Serpetta continue their jousting; Ramiro and Arminda continue their quarreling.
Sandrina and Contino, bewildered, slide into a gentle delirium, she fancying to be Cloris, he Orfeo.
Podesta demands a duel of pistols with Contino, Ramiro a duel with swords.
Sandrina becomes Medusa, Contino Alcides.
The others are dumbfounded by the spectacle of the couple lost in their mad happiness.

[Mozart lets the orchestra ""depict the strangeness of the situation"" in the forest, ""with declamatory writing for the voices"". This ""captures"" the ""frightening noises"", the ""timid whisperings"", the ""tiptoeing to and fro"", while ""the skipping basses and chuckling woodwinds ensure that the situation does not become too serious.""]

ACT III

No. 24a: Aria 'Mirate Che Contrasto' (Nardo)

[Serpetta repeats to Nardo she does not want him. Contino arrives, taking Nardo for his beloved. Then Sandrina stops him, taking him for her spouse. Nardo tries to distract them both.]

Look at the contrast between the sun and moon. And the lovesick stars. And then their duel, their wrestling.

[Nardo's last aria is accompanied by ""an increasingley agitated"" orchestra. His sense of ridicule ""already anticipates Leporello's elogquent impishness"" in ""Don Giovanni""].

No. 24b: Duetto ""Da bravi seguitate"" (Sandrina, Contino)

[The lovers are still in thrall to madness.]

Carry on, good people. The moon is falling. Help, a storm is breaking out.

[Mozart does not exploit the ""buffa"" ""grotesque exaggeration"" in this ""absurd situation"". The lovers' first duet is ""far too serious"" for ""buffa"".]

No. 25: 'Aria 'Mio Padrone, Io Dir Volevo' (Podesta) [MISSING]

[Podesta is harassed, first by Serpetta, who reminds him of his past promises; then by Arminda who wants her Contino; and by Ramiro, who wants Arminda. Podesta can't tale the accumulated tension any longer.]

My Lord, I wanted to say to you...Let me speak (""Ma lasciatemi parlar""). Arminda, take your Contino. Ramiro, marry my niece. Don't bother me any more.

[Podesta's third and last aria about his loss of control when ""assailed on every side."" Note the ""extremely flexible and independent writing for the orchestra, which already looks forward to the later composer"".
It is ironical that Abert found that Mozart, the adolescent composer, was already being Mozart, the accomplished musician, before he became ""Mozart"", the icon for posterity.
The illusion of hindsight afflicts and obfuscates most of the previous Mozart scholars before Stanley Sadie.]

No. 26: Aria 'Va Pure Ad Altri In Braccio' (Ramiro)

[Arminda repeats to Ramiro that he cannot hope for anything from a woman who doesn't love him.]

Go then into other arms, but I'll pursue you. I'll die miserably.

[Ramiro's third and last is another grand aria, an ""outburst of oddly unbridled anger."" It is ""a counterpart to Arminda's grandiose aria No. 13, 'Vorrei Punirti Indegno'"" but ""more vehement and demonic"" in expressing the ""despair of a fatally wounded heart"", never heard before in ""buffa"". Mozart, ever since childhood, is always at his most powerful when depicting anger, rage, vengeance -- his ""demonic"" side, dixit Abert.]

No. 27: Duetto 'Tu Mi Lasci?' (Sandrina, Contino)

[Sandrina and Contino awake from their sleep, lying apart on a meadow. They sight and recognize each other. She moves to depart.]

Are you leaving me?

[They seem to be leaving on opposite sides, but stop, and, gradually return, slowly getting close together, and admit their love.]

Who can resist love? Joy and happiness in our hearts.

[This is the second lovers' duet in their grand scene, ""on a far higher level"" than the first, with its classical action of ""lovers' mutual recognition, followed by temporary discord, and ultimate reconciliation."" The music is exquisitely insightful, catching the fleeting moods, tender or ardent, of the two lovers.]

No. 28: Finale of Act III. Recitative and Coro 'Viva Pur La Giardiniera' (Contino, Sandrina, Arminda, Ramiro, Podesta, Serpetta, Nardo) total 3' 47""

[""Scena Ultima"" starts with a final ensemble recitative. The madness is over. The lovers reunite, they will marry. Sandrina acknowledges her disguise.
Arminda begs pardon for kidnapping Sandrina.
Podesta gives in, he gives his blessing to Arminda marrying her Ramiro, and to Serpetta her Nardo. Podesta, left alone, will marry when he finds another Sandrina.
Sandrina will always remember his goodness, and remain ""la finta giardiniera per amore.""
It ends with the traditional advice to the audience to enjoy love.]

Viva pur la Giardiniera...Viva amore/Che fa tutti rallegrar.
(Long live the garden-girl...long live love/Which makes everyone happy.)

IN CONCLUSION: ""OPERA BUFFA"" GETS MARRIED TO ""OPERA SERIA""

Mozart shows his superior ""dramatic gifts"" and ""greater mastery"" in the ensembles, with ""sharply contrasted characters"", where ""the plot moves quickly, with a lively exchange"".

Remarkable also is the ""unusual role of tragedy"" in this ""buffa"", where ""sudden outbursts of authentic passion"", with no parody intent, ""were inconceivable."" Mozart's characters are ""suddenly wracked"" with passions. The whole opera is no longer a pleasing harmony of tone, as in traditional ""buffa"".
But the mix permits ""a wealth of invention and sheer originality."" Mozart, by sensitivity and unique temperament, could not ""treat deep-seated emotions as a source of ridicule"", and tended ""to emphasize these emotions with all the demonic ardour of his soul, breaking down the barriers of ""opera buffa""...for the first time in history.""
""This is Mozart's first attempt to tear the masks from the faces of his Italian characters and allow them to speak the language of the heart.""

The mix of comedy and tragedy shows its seams: they ""appear alongside each other, with no inner or outer connection, comedy in the motley of `opera buffa', tragedy in the guise of `opera seria'."" The result? A unique, energetic, excitingly beautiful opera, a sure crowd-pleaser.

Abert's final evaluation is amusing for its inveterate Romantic flavor: "" 'La Finta Giardiniera' is the work of a young genius driven in a new direction by a dark and irresistibly powerful force."" Mozart will find the perfect style to intimately combine comedy and tragedy only once he will have ""known life's harsh vicissitudes"", when ""the goal was to be revealed in all its blinding clarity"" (p. 339).

8136296,4,B000H4VZI0,"Written when Mozart was just 18 years old, La Finta Giardiniera is undoubtedly one of the composer's lesser works.  It's very conventional in its arrangements, the development of the story and the tone owing much to the Neapolitan opera buffa style popularised by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi.  With Mozart, as with Pergolesi, however, there's a great deal of interest in the common people and a conflict exists between the serving classes and their masters where the roles are often somewhat reversed.  With several characters assuming secret identities, appearances are often deceptive, and happiness cannot be found while one's true self is kept hidden.  Even the gender confusion over the cross-dressing and the filling of male roles by female singers and castrati that are typical of these kind of comedies plays on this.  Who really rules the roost and who wears the trousers?

What further distinguishes and exalts Mozart's (and indeed Pergolesi's) treatment of this fairly standard Metastasian situation more than just the realisation of the comic potential within the work, is the playfulness and the originality of the manner in which he brings order to all this confusion.  It's far from Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, or indeed Cos Fan Tutte (but then it doesn't have a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte either), but even in this early work by the composer, the arrangements in La Finta Giardiniera are light and clever, sparkling with wit and invention in a way that belies what could otherwise be a heavy-handed melodrama filed with unlikely contrivances.  There's a lightness and vibrancy, a consistency and appropriateness of tone that Mozart brings to the work, and that's brought out wonderfully by the La Scintilla orchestra of the Zurich Opera House under Nicholas Harnoncourt.

The singing too is good all around, the cast well-suited to the roles in physical appearance as well as in the tone of voices.  None of them are particularly exceptional, singing either with too little feeling for the characters or too much.  Eva Mei sings Sandrina beautifully, but seems elsewhere and not really engaged with the others around her, while at the other end of the scale, Rudolf Schasching's Podest's personality is a little over-emphasised to the detriment of the singing.  Christoph Strehl and Isabel Rey have rather a better handle on their characters and are delightful, as is the comic contribution and interaction between Julia Kleiter's Serpetta and Gabriel Bermdez's Nardo.

Unfortunately, it's rather let down by the staging.  Tobias Moretti's direction never really manages to bring any real life to the admittedly limited opportunities for drama to be found within the arrangements.  With a few pot-plants and twigs scattered around, the clean white designs of the stage scarcely resemble a garden since the all-purpose structure has to make do for the interiors of the Podest's home as well.  There are a few off-stage amusements and some back and forth interaction between the stage and the orchestra pit that help keep it interesting, and one of two clips of security camera footage that extend the scope to show outside events, but nothing ever comes together thematically or with a consistency of tone.

Still, this is an enjoyable account of a neglected early Mozart work.  It only existed in revised German Singspiel form until the original Italian version was rediscovered in the 1970s and recorded for the first time by Harnoncourt, so there are not too many staged versions available.  (An open-air production at Aix-en-Provence in 2012 - not available on DVD as yet - takes advantage of the outdoor location and fares rather better with fresh young singers in the roles).  The Blu-ray release from Arthaus Musik is a reissue of the previous TDK release, retaining the original menus and specifications, only with new packaging.  There's some minor flicker in the encoding of the image, but the sound is fine on the PCM and DTS HD-Master Audio 7.1 mixes.  The BD is all-region, with subtitles in English, German, French and Spanish.",1372118400,2,4064,5.125757575757576
8136297,4,B000H4VZI0,"You will rarely see an Opera as well produced , performed and conducted as this production. The cast has a wonderful time. The youthful Julia Kleiter in one of her starting roles is really attractive. Eva Mei gives a ""Tour de Force"" performance and Christoph Strehl , a light tenor, is right up there w/Juan Diego Flores.

However, Mozart wrote this at 19,and watching it you realize how grateful you are that his Operas improved through the years . But you are thankful for how entertaining this particular production is and that you now have it in your Mozart DVD collection.",1344988800,3,577,4.712871287128713
8136298,4,B000H4VZI0,It is a delight to have this work.  Even though it is in modern format and the tenor adequate and not first rank Mozart material.  The trouser role mezzo is a joy.,1260921600,2,163,4.0625
8136299,5,B000H4VZI0,"This new version of Finta Giardiniera is one of the best performances I've seen on DVD of a lesser known Mozart opera. Although many people might find the production to be modern, I think it is very well conceived. It is set more or less in the 50's and the stage is always the same but there are a few changes with the lights and some props that are brought in that give you the idea of a garden in a big house. The acting of all the singers is impressive, specially because it is more difficult to make people laugh than to make them cry. They are all constantly doing things, although it is their key moment and this gives the performance a lot of action to look at. Harnoncourt is one of the best Mozart conductors and he makes the orchestra shine throughout the 3 hours. Christoph Strehl is Count Belfiore and he sings and acts the role to perfection. He has charm, is good looking and knows very well his technique so you can see he is really enojoying the performance. Eva Mei is Sandrina, the ""Giardiniera"", and she sings the role with elegance and acts the tormented role with tenderness. For me, the best female performance comes from Spanish soprano Isabel Rey who sings the role of Arminda. She is suppose to be the bad girl in the plot but you end up falling for her charm and her incredible voice. Her two arias and her comic spark are wonderful. Liliana Nikiteanu is Ramiro, Arminda's scorned lover (a trouser role) and she is very believable as a boy. Her last aria is very impressive and her sexy mezzo voice sounds perfect for the role. Special mention goes to Julia Kleiter's mischivious Serpetta, Gabriel Bermudez's tender Nardo and Rudolf Schasching's Podesta.

If you want to hear lovely music, see wonderful singer-actors and enjoy an evening with a Mozart opera, then you must buy this Bella Giardiniera!",1162598400,14,1828,4.556231003039514
