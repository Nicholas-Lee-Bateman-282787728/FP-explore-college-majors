1648871,5,B00005QT1V,The movie was hilarious.  The animation was clever and brought some humor to the landscape.  I've seen boring documentaries that was no more than a travel guide.  This brought some of the scenes to life.,1053648000,2,203,4.742857142857143
1648872,1,B00005QT1V,"My wife and I just finished planning our upcoming Costa Rican vacation and hastily ordered this video from Amazon based on the recommendations of the other reviewers. Now that I have watched it, I can honestly say it is one of the worst travel videos I have ever seen. This video has honestly made me *less* excited about my upcoming trip.
First off, Senor Rico uses an obnoxiously fake accent throughout the video to make such poignant observations as ""that bird has a big neck"". As if his elementary information wasn't bad enough, the ""producer"" of this...felt obligated to run through every distracting transition effect known to mankind--at a rate of about 1 every 10 seconds! The footage between the transitions was poorly lit, rarely centered or steady, and was generally boring.
Production values aside, there is little to no information about CR in this video that can't be gained from a cursory glance at any of the hundreds of travel websites out there. This video is a disservice to the Costa Rican travel industry and should be avoided at all costs.",1052438400,5,1061,4.835164835164835
1648873,4,B00005QT1V,"The nature shots in this film are amazing.  The camera captures Costa Rica in its true, natural beauty.  Along the jungle's beaches, in the mountains and hillsides, or roaming villages, Senor Rico whets the traveller's appetite for a wonderful trip.
The one knock on the film is its inclusion of non-native Costa Ricans engaging in odd behavior.  I would gladly have watched a full hour of the nature footage without these passages.
Did I mention that the nature shots are absolutely amazing?",1049673600,,492,4.975609756097561
1648874,5,B00005QT1V,"I liked this video a lot because it didn't feature the commercail ""Travel Channel"" fare that you normally expect. It is shot from a tourists view and the incredible and abundant wildlife shots are great. Again, not one or two shots, but dozens of different animals, awesome! This video has a real person feel and you'll love it!",1048982400,,328,4.672413793103448
1648875,5,B00005QT1V,"My children loved this video and Senor Rico!  They enjoyed all the wildlife footage and great Costa Rica scenery.  I recommend this video to people with children, or if you are planning a trip to Costa Rica soon.  It will help you plan your visit.",1048204800,,247,4.444444444444445
1648876,1,B00005QT1V,"Take your camcorder on your next vacation. Shoot random disconnected sequences of video without a storyline, and without using a tripod. Be sure to not have any knowledge of basic camera techniques as you do this. Then when you edit your video add some insanely amateurish special effects, and voice overs. Then sell it. It seems to have worked for ""Senor Rico"" in his ""Costa Rica Adventures"" video.
That idea is as great as this video is bad.",1046131200,,443,4.6923076923076925
1648877,5,B00005QT1V,"Most travel video-makers get special treatment and benefits from hotels, restaurants, etc.  What I especially liked about this video was the real low-down on Costa Rica.  Refreshing!  Having travelled a lot, I know that each country has its good points and its problems.  I was glad to get the honest truth in this informative travel adventure.  Now I really want to see Costa Rica with its unique beauty while understanding better the realities.  It was fun, honest and informative - who can ask for anything more!",1045267200,,515,4.930232558139535
1648878,4,B00005QT1V,My husband and I are planning a trip to Costa Rica and found this video to be both very helpful and amusing.  The footage was excellent and confirmed our interest in having a Costa Rica adventure/experience.  We only wish that Senor Rico could be our guide!,1037664000,,257,4.565217391304348
1648879,5,B00005QT1V,"I wanted to see this video as I had heard so much about Costa Rica and didn't know much about the country.  The Senor Rico accent was fluctuating, with the American accent trying to get through.  After a couple of minutes I started to like the accent, it was so bad it was good, somewhat like an Ed Wood voiceover.  A real hoot!
The highlight of this production for me was the effort taken to film the flora and fauna, a particular interest of mine.  For this feature alone I would gladly have seen a longer video.  All throughout, the characters were evidently having so much fun and their enthusiasm for their experience was very infectious.  I can't wait to get there and the video certainly helped make up my mind to go.  I intend to watch it again a couple of times before I go, to trace the route taken by the travellers on my map.  I found this feature also useful for planning my trip.",1034726400,5,893,4.3053892215568865
7950796,5,B00005QT1V,This is one of the funniest travel video's you will ever see. It is a spoof on travel video industry while actually teaching you a bit about Costa Rica. It is for the person looking to have fun while learning. It is not for the serious minded individual. I enjoyed this approach to video travel documentary. It demonstrated great creativity on Mr. Richman's part. I would recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy their travel planning.,1113782400,,436,4.75
7950797,1,B00005QT1V,"I agree with the poor reviews.  This has got to be a joke that was slipped by the Amazon buyers.  This is worse than a home movie you are forced to watch in a room of teenagers you don't know, because you PAID for it! I will demand my money back.",1108944000,,246,3.803921568627451
7950798,1,B00005QT1V,"I gotta agree with the other reviewer; this is for 4-year-0lds ONLY and adults should peruse the best book I ever found about Costa Rica, and that's the coffee  table book, ""Costa Rica: the last country the gods made.""
Really, Amazon should be embarrassed to be selling this!",1085788800,2,275,4.729166666666667
7950799,1,B00005QT1V,"I have been to costa rica and wanted to show freinds about it. This is not the video to have people watch to learn about Costa Rica! If you have not gone to Costa Rica, DO NOT WATCH THIS VIDEO!!!",1073865600,,195,3.9
7950800,1,B00005QT1V,"I bought this video based on the number of stars it had received. It is an extremely poor representation of a country. The video is an embarasment, a waste of time and grossly over priced. If it were free it would be too expensive. Shame on Senor Rico and the publishers.",1072310400,,271,4.333333333333333
7950801,1,B00005QT1V,"My wife and I are planning a trip to Costa Rica in the Spring of 2004 so we purchased this video.  As far as I am concerned, watching this video was a waste of time. It was amateur at best and was less than informative.  After watching this video and the view of Cost Rica it gave, had I not seen the country in print articles etc., it would have made me cancel my plans.",1071532800,,371,3.933333333333333
7950802,5,B00005QT1V,"I purchased the video to get my family acquainted with Costa Rica prior to our trip.  Being a former visitor of Costa Rica (during my single-backpacking days), I found that it highlighted many of the interesting sites and wonders of nature that make Costa Rica a must-see destination.  Its light-hearted format and beautiful scenery made it interesting for my children and held their ever active imagination.  So much so, that they learned the names of the wild-life to expect during our trip (with the help of Senor Rico) - as parents we couldn't ask for more.  As avid viewers of the various 'Animal and nature' channels currently available on TV, we found this to be more informative and entertaining....",1066003200,,707,4.915966386554622
7950803,5,B00005QT1V,"I had no idea about what Costa Rica has to offer, until I saw this video.  The movie is not your typical travel documentary. It adds some fun to the adventure.",1065225600,,159,4.129032258064516
7950804,1,B00005QT1V,"This video has poor picture quality. It's more of a cheap home movie with annoying transitions,unfitting music,and no logical sequence. Don't waste your money on this!",1064534400,,167,5.461538461538462
