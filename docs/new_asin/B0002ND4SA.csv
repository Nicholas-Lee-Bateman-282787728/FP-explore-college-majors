8029591,3,B0002ND4SA,"Great fun, as all Strauss should be. I was surprised I had never heard of this piece. And I liked it, especially the staging- right on the banks of the Grand Canal. It was a bit too much like ""Fledermaus"" for me, but really that's OK too. I had a very difficult time following the story, or even making any sense of it at all. Still, for a Johann Strauss lover, well worth owning.",1431216000,2,380,4.148648648648648
