2554758,5,B000F8O1IO,"Terrific and brave film. Goes alongside the powerful Boys of St. Vincents and the Magdalene sisters that also deal with child abuse in Catholic orphanages and reformatories and disgusting coverups. The acting is very good and the photography and editing all work well.

The motives of the primary abusive character seem pretty clear. He is a screwed up person who finds a perfect niche in clerical garb where he can hide his true character behind what might appear to the world as a virtuous drive to fight evil. This is a very old, old story. When will we ever learn?!!!!! There was the Inquisition and various purges of so called heretics and endless scandals in church run orphanages etc. Today we have plenty of scandals in all religions.

The film shows some of the dynamics of how the institution tends to protect and cover up and this protection of the interests of the reputation and power of institutions of course also helps to offer cover to dysfunctional people. This film focuses on a Catholic institution as most of the other films mentioned do as well. See also Bunuel's film El. I really don't think the point is just about Catholicism, however. It is about unaccountability and how using the name of God can be a cheap way to get power over others -- or it might be using a flag, or any other emotional front. This is the broader lesson. Sanctimony is not just a problem among Catholics or Christians broadly speaking.

In the background there are allusions to the Spanish Civil War. The sadistic character was not simply sadistic. He was even more very authoritarian. It was difficult to not make a connection between this authoritarian individual and his followers and the fascists in Spain and then Germany. The film just about rubs your face in in and I am surprised that none of the other reviewers develop this aspect of the film. I think it is an important aspect of the film. Passing him off as simply sadistic misses much of what the film has to say. I think one could argue that there is very little sadism per se in the film although there is enormous brutality. Sadism is there and there is a bit of sexual abuse but I would argue that the authoritarian theme is stronger and perhaps should be more disturbing.",1328572800,2,2239,4.634760705289673
2554759,3,B000F8O1IO,"This movie is set in an Irish institution for delinquent children in the 1930s.  Many of the children are very young, so it's hard to imagine why they were incarcerated.  The Catholic men running the facility were made out to be monsters -- the head person was sadistically violent and his aide was a pedophile.  The plot is that a good, non-Catholic man comes to teach there and tries to defend the kids.  It is very clear that the head person is going to eventually beat one of the kids to death, and it's pretty clear which one it will be.  The violence is extreme and hard to watch, as is the sodomy of a young child.  The performances are very good, but the editing is poor, jumping around so that it's hard to follow the story - there must have been explanatory parts cut to shorten the movie.  Also, there is never any rational given as to why the head master so enjoys beating the kids.  NOTE:  this is not a movie for pre-adolescent children.",1305244800,2,951,4.357954545454546
2554760,4,B000F8O1IO,"On the positive this film features Iain Glen and Aiden Quinn, two quite spectacular thespians. Glen once again gets to play a creep. I first saw him as Preston in ""Wives and Daughters"" and was impressed by his brooding depth. He's perfect as the obsessive-compulsive, sadistic priest. I can't imagine him ever giving a bad performance. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent.

Never once did my engagement flag, which indicates something went very right with the script and the editing. Only the magenta colored flash-back sequences, which seemed both incongruous and conventional, made me roll my eyes. But that is a minor detail in an otherwise riveting drama.",1303516800,,667,5.0636363636363635
2554761,3,B000F8O1IO,"This is a very good movie but doesn't stand up to the ravings of artistry etc.  It's a good film, period.",1295827200,,105,4.0
2554762,5,B000F8O1IO,"This is the kind of picture that make you think, cry, and at the same time wondering how in the name of God could exist people like the rulers of Saint Jude reformatory.

This is the kind of story where love will triumph over the evil and the heartless monks that rules the reformatory, however the price that the inmates and the teacher that tries to help them will pay, will be terrible.

Based on a real story, ""A SONG FOR A RAGGY BOY"", shows us young boys and teenagers hunger for love, how they are abused for a brother that is in charger of the boys' discipline, and how with brutal methods he punishes them. For the boys this is their hopeless and gray world where fear to be punished is the constant of their lives.

But other danger looms over them and Patrick Delaney will live all the cruelty of that  danger being only thirteen and half years old, while the monks that know about this pretend that nothing is happening.

Franklyn (The teacher) establishes a close relationship with Liam Mercier (a Student), and he earns the love and respect of the other children that hunger of love find in him the love that they yearn so much.

This is a film that you can't miss, you will be rewarded with amazing performing, but the must important thing the power of love.

Este es el tipo de pel&iacute;cula que te hace pensar, llorar, y al mismo tiempo preguntarte como en el nombre de Dios pueden existir personas como las que gobiernan el reformatorio San Judas.

Esta es el tipo de historia donde el amor triunfar&aacute; sobre la maldad y lo desalmado que son los monjes que dirigen el reformatorio, sin embargo el precio que el maestro y los internos van  a tener que pagar ser&aacute; terrible.

Basada en un hecho real, ""PADRE NUESTRO"" muestra a ni&ntilde;os y adolescentes que est&aacute;n hambrientos de amor, como abusa de ellos el hermano encargado de la disciplina de los internos, y como con m&eacute;todos brutales los castiga. Para los chicos este es su desesperanzador y gris mundo donde el temor a ser castigados es la constante de sus vidas.

Pero otro peligro se cierne sobre ellos y Patrick Delaney vivir&aacute; en carne propia ese peligro teniendo tan solo trece a&ntilde;os y medio, ante el silencio y la complacencia de otros monjes

Franklyn (El profesor) establece una relaci&oacute;n cercana con Liam Mercier (Un estudiante), y se gana el cari&ntilde;o y el respeto de los otros chicos que hambrientos de amor lo encuentran en &eacute;l,

Esta es una pel&iacute;cula que no te puedes perder, y ser&aacute;s premiado con extraordinarias actuaciones , pero la cosa mas importante el poder del amor.",1273708800,3,2625,4.730263157894737
2554763,5,B000F8O1IO,I saw this movie at Sundance and then it disappeared.  I've always suspected the Catholic Church bought it or in some way had something to do with the distribution.  What an incredible film -- best acting Aidan Quinn has ever done.,1272758400,10,231,4.609756097560975
2554764,5,B000F8O1IO,"Aidan is incomparable in his role here; You will love him in this true story. The story is sad, tragic, horrifying. In addition to what was done to the children, it was especially shocking to find out in the end that these evil, abusive priests were not arrested, but were sent elsewhere in the world to possibly, or more likely, probably,  do more damage to children. It is beyond me how that could happen. I hope that has all changed. Hopefully, this film has/will open people's eyes and keep them alert to abuses, and, hopefully, this exposure and others have and will continue to put an end to it. On the bright side, there are some wonderful interactions between Aidan's character and the boys that are a delight to watch. It's amazing how the human spirit can still shine when treated with kindness & love.  The film is well-done and I recommend it for adults only, of course, though be prepared to be mortified. I am not Catholic, but I do know that this is a terrible, shameful thing done by some, while most true believers of the Church, have done and are doing wonderful things for the downtrodden, poor,& lost, and that they love and bring honor to God. This is an awful, unfortunately, true piece of history spotlighted in this film, but it is not the whole picture of the Church, of course. To balance this true story, watch another true story: Molokai,the story of Father Damien, who went to live amongst the lepers and gave his life for them.",1223683200,5,1457,4.557251908396947

this movie  is  to see and  think about  those  we  respect  as  god  servents.

2554766,4,B000F8O1IO,I liked this movie very much. I enjoy seeing Irish films. It's one of Aidan Quinn's best roles and I liked seeing Andrew Simpson ( Notes on a Scandal ) as a young boy.,1202428800,,167,3.9411764705882355
2554767,4,B000F8O1IO,"an enjoyable movie to watch (i do love the accents). often sad, but heartening at the same time.",1198886400,,96,4.388888888888889
8118957,5,B000F8O1IO,"What a shocking and moving film! I am a retired teacher and could not imagine such a story to be true, especially in this type of clerical environment. Psychologically, it is very well put together, yet the response from the children is far too subdued and not enough described in depth  in the story. I am sure that other incidents, just as significant as those described in this movie, could have been brought up. The number  of abuses had to be more than those described. The endurance of the kids needed to be more emphasized as I am sure, it was.
I agree with one of the descriptions I read, do not show this film to younger kids, it might be traumatizing for some. My emotions were difficult to control towards the end of the film.
It seems that this film has not had the success it really deserves. Only English is available, with no subtitles to boot, yet the Irish accent is rather difficult for me to understand sometimes.. The result must be a rather confidential availability, and it is very sad indeed, and undeserved.",1525996800,,1031,4.537634408602151

8118960,5,B000F8O1IO,"This movie is heart-wrenching, but good. I first learned about this movie from youtube, there's a song associated with this movie but the song is not heard in the move. Great movie, but sad to learn that boys were mistreated so bad, and the song on youtube is a great song, I listen 2 it often...if interested, go to youtube and type in: ""Four walls, One faith, No Identity",1392595200,,373,4.420289855072464
8118961,4,B000F8O1IO,Sadly when I was in Ireland a person that I met advised that I should look at this movie.  I had seen the Magdalina Girls.  A true story of how the nuns would lock up pretty young girls because they felt they would get themselves into trouble.  The Magdalina Girls were three girls that shared this fate.  Only one of them was able to escape.  In this story of a Raggy Boy the boy does ot escape and is beat to death by one of the priests.  Unfortunately this did happen and can never be undone.  It is shameful and a disgrace to the church.  But it did happen.  Everyone needs to see this movie to know what can happen when the wrong people are in control of helpless children.  It is a sobering story that falls to close to the truth.  Shamefullly so.,1392163200,,753,4.159722222222222
8118962,5,B000F8O1IO,"I just finished watching this movie for the second time and was as impressed as much this time as the first time I viewed it.  It is hard to watch--very painful, very sad--but it reflects what actually went on, and that fact is becoming more and more documented as revelations about the sordid history of the Catholic Church's treatment of ""wayward"" boys continues to be exposed.  Everyone is focused currently on the retirement of the Pope, which some suggest was in response to yet more revelations of wayward priests being discovered, even within the confines of the Vatican itself.  Whether that proves true or not, clearly the Irish Catholic Church has been scandalized by past abuse claims. This film is so touching and poignant.  Aidan Quinn gives an amazing performance!  Highly recommended!",1362096000,,799,5.0227272727272725
8118963,5,B000F8O1IO,I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.  I but this movie because we had just watched a movie with Andrew Simpson in it and I liked his acting.  Found this one and ordered it.  Great stuff.,1356480000,,196,4.243243243243243
8118964,5,B000F8O1IO,This a powerful movie with excellant acting and fits in with today's contempary issues. It is too bad that a child had to die in order awaken some people's eyes.,1347148800,,161,4.4
8118965,5,B000F8O1IO,"The first lay teacher, William Franklin, in Saint Jude's Reformatory and Industrial school in Ireland in 1939, coming back from the defeated republican war in Spain, had a hard time with the prefect of the school, a brutal and sadistic disciplinary brute, ""brother"" and why not ""father"" John.

This first lay teacher will nearly leave some time around Christmas 1939 when John beat to death Liam Mercier, a child that William Franklin had saved from total rejection and submission to his fate of pariah. The children unanimously stopped him when he was leaving after John and his accomplice Mac, a priest who was abusing some children, had been moved out of the school, one to go preach Africans in Africa and the other to take care of a parish in the USA. In other words the murder went unpunished.

Things were changing since the separation wall between the younger boys and the older boys was being brought down by the priests and by the kids. The school was finally able to contemplate a happier future and the boys committed here by justice were finally able to consider some kind of a positive future.

The film insists on the fact that such boys who have been rejected by their families, then by society and locked up behind bars need like all children, but it is a lot more difficult to give them what they need, motivation to learn, understanding based on listening and love, a lot of love, and that's where this refectory and industrial school system was completely wrong. The guidance these kids needed and expected could easily be turned into complete alienation and physical violence and the love they looked for and wanted could be twisted into sexual abuse in a jiffy.

The main lesson from such a real episode as depicted in this film is that these boys were not responsible for what they were to become on the basis of what they had been and had done because between the two, the past and the future, the present of education, understanding and love was transformed into alienation, depravation, exploitation, violence and abuse by some sadistic and perverted adults, unluckily tolerated by the others who lacked the courage to say no.

But the last scene of this film is a full symbol of the love these kids expect from the adult world and the love they are able to give back when they have been nourished and nurtured with what they need to be and become.

This is a very beautiful film that adds to this sad Irish episode some dramatic flashbacks on the Spanish Civil War and the news about the beginning of the Second World War. Unluckily history was to make William Franklin die on the beaches of Normandy in 1944. He was not able to see the future of the world in which he had fought all his living years against injustice and violence.

8118966,5,B000F8O1IO,"This film is an unfortunate accurate depiction of the terrible abuse perpetrated on children in Catholic, youth institutions for over 75 years.  Only recently, has the tide turned in bringing to light this tragic history of the thousands of victims.  Two things are significant to me, the first is the lay teacher (a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and poet)who became a champion and defender of his students.  As a former educator, I was impressed with his success with his most challenging students.  The culture of mutual support was incredible.  The way the other students congratulated each others successes was proof of the classroom culture that he developed. We have been encourage to ""individualize"" learning for our students.  He was a master of that in the early 40ies!

The saddest part of this movie was not the unforgivable rape of one student, the vicious physical abuse of others, and even the murder of one.  It was the way that the Church dealt with the criminal sadistic priest/brother.  He was sent to Africa and not to jail.  And from what I know of the African missions at that time, I dread to even think of how many more victims that he had before he died. The Church today cannot do enough to rectify and to acknowledge this sordid history.  It still remains to see if the patriarchal hierarchy will do what is right.",1341532800,2,1343,4.721030042918455
