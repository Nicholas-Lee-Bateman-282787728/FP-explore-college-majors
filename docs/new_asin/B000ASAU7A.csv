8079557,5,B000ASAU7A,This is a very interesting film about a man wanting to be more connected with the animals that he wanted to eat. It is very eye opening important film. 95% of the population just look at packaged meat and buy it. Great film!,1436832000,,224,4.232558139534884
8079558,4,B000ASAU7A,"Jason Young writes and directs this personal documentary about an emotional, intellectual and physical experiment he undergoes to try farm life, and raising and killing his own meat. He's a gentle-hearted, soft-spoken hippie with a taste for animal flesh who wants to see if living closely with his future meals -- treating them as pets -- will change him. It's a balanced and fair look at the practice of killing meat for food, not some inflamed, PETA-inspired propaganda. The end will surprise you.
