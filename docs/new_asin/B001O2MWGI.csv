3725766,5,B001O2MWGI,"The Chalean Extreme DVD series arrived quickly and in good shape. So far,
I really like the videos. I am learning to add heavier weight than I expected. Definitely feel it afterward. Chalean is not annoying like others.",1235865600,8,219,4.7894736842105265
3725767,5,B001O2MWGI,"This workout is great because there is a different workout for each day of the week.  The weight training portion is only about 35 minutes long each - done 3 times a week and the two cardio days are a killer - interval training and you know you are burning off alot of calories.  I really love the countdown clock - for each exercise, there is a clock that shows how much time is left.  I have lost some body fat already - only on week 2 - although I haven't been eating as well as I should - I can only imagine how much more I could be losing if I followed the eating plan as well.  Chalene is fun, motivational, and really so comfortable to listen to.  And I like the slow and heavy reps - even in the 2nd week, I feel sore after each workout (and I am already in pretty good shape from before as I am a runner).

Definitely worth the money - I actually cancelled my gym membership b/c with this, I am consistently working out, unlike not being able to go the gym or not having the motivation to go.

UPDATE: I am now on week 6 of this program and went from a 28% body fat to 24% within 6 weeks, and that is without ""dieting.""  I lost about 4 inches from my waist, 1 inch from my hips, but only 4 pounds overall.  This is exactly the kind of result that I wanted - lose body fat, look leaner and tighter, and not lose muscle mass.  And I still look forward to working out every day.  Chalene says in the beginning that there will come a time when I will look forward to my workouts.  Well, I definitely do now.  And this is from me, a busy mom of 3 little kids, who is near 40.",1234828800,418,1579,3.9588607594936707
3725768,5,B001O2MWGI,"I hate, hate, hate to exercise, but I did Chalene Johnson's Turbo Jam and lost 45 lbs.  Now, I'm doing ChaLean Extreme to firm up everything, and I love this system.  Chalene is very motivating, and she tells you that when you don't feel like exercising to just give her 5 minutes and she'll change your mind.  It's so true.  Once I get started, I feel amazing.  The exercises were just a few intense reps, and I can really feel the difference in just a few short weeks.  I'm hoping to have the best body of my life by late Spring, and with this system, I really think it's possible.  Well worth the money!!",1234396800,17,607,4.271929824561403
3725769,5,B001O2MWGI,"ChaLEAN Extreme is a truly amazing program. Not only does the box come with a guide book to help you keep track of everything, it comes with a healthy eating book, a thigh toner, a tracker for how much body fat percentage you have and even a motivational CD to go along with the DVDs. Each workout is intense, so they have a point when they say consult a physician before using. In just the first week I can FEEL the difference.
I'd recommend this program to ANYONE who wants to get lean. It's incredible.",1234051200,6,505,4.326315789473684
3725770,5,B001O2MWGI,"I love this system.  It's well worth the money.  You get 3 months worth of workouts and recipes and a plan for maintenance.  I am on week 3 and have lost 10 lbs and several inches.  If you are serious about seeing better results than you've seen in the past, make sure you focus on the eating part of the plan.  So many people only do the workouts and then wonder why they don't look like the people in the infomercial.  Beachbody uses real customers in their infomercials, so the results are real, but you HAVE to do all aspects of the program.  Otherwise, you'll tone up but your results won't be as amazing as what you've seen on TV.  One other note is that you will need heavier weights than you may be used to - yes, even if you're a woman.  Start with what you have and then consider investing in some additional weights or bands when you feel like the exercises have become easy. This program is for real and I love it!",1233187200,66,926,4.215909090909091
3725771,5,B001O2MWGI,"Beachbody has outdone themselves with the packaging of this product.  The dvd's are housed in a quad fold folder.  It is cardboard, but it is a nice feature.  There are 14 actual workouts along with a motivational cd and band basics/kitchen makeover dvd.  They are counting one of these as #15 which is unfair because its not actually a workout.  Chalene is very encouraging and offers lots of advice and tips throughout the workout.  She has a different demeanor compared to her turbo jam workouts.  She's serious and all business in this series.

Two books (yes actual books and not a leaflet/pamphlet) comes with the system.  One book is based on nutrition and has lots of recipes.  She talks of adjusting your intake with each phase in order to fuel your body properly.  The other book talks about the system.  You use this to follow your rotation and progress.  There are worksheets you can copy or you can print them out from beachbody.com

As with any beachbody product, the production is professional, crisp and clear.  The appeal of the workouts is that they focus on different muscle groups using heavier weight then you are used to.  The reps are few, the weight is heavy, the moves are effective.  I'm in the burn phase at the moment and many moves are dual purpose.  Ex. lunge with overhead press.  I don't think this workout is for the person that has never worked out because your own knowledge and experience helps to adjust moves that do not feel comfortable.  The push phase focuses on more individual movement, ex just a bicep curl.  The lean phase from what I've read is also a killer portion and brings it all together.

Beachbody's other expensive system is p90x.  I've not used that system so I can't compare.  Chalean Extreme is the most expensive system that I own and I'm not the least bit sorry I bought it.",1233187200,26,1834,4.641744548286605
3725772,3,B001O2MWGI,"Nice and short workouts for those that are busy. BUT it is slow! This is not an exciting routine but it is effective, IF you lift the right weight for you. P.S. If you use the resistance band, it is horrible. Buy a separate one.",1498953600,,228,4.088888888888889
3725773,5,B001O2MWGI,"I'm brand new to weight training after being more of a cardio girl for most of my fitness journey. I've heard of the amazing results of weight training, but I was never interested because it was not my desire to ""bulk up."" Well, after going through Chalene's Turbo Jam program and one of her Turbo Fire workout DVD's, I decided to give ChaLEAN Extreme and weight training a try because I totally believe in Chalene, she is effective and FUN! And that is what this weight lifting program is--effective and fun! I never thought that I'd love lifting so much. And being a woman who has had ""zero arm strength"" her entire life, I never thought that I could get stronger and push-ups easier. And no, I am not ""bulking up."" I'm in the ""push"" phase and I am so much stronger and tighter than I ever was in my entire life. My booty and thighs--tight and amazing! I'm more easily using 20 lb weights this phase and it's such an accomplished feeling! This program truly is effective and Chalene is a WONDERFUL coach all throughout. If you are new to weight training, start here!!!",1497052800,6,1070,4.492307692307692
3725774,5,B001O2MWGI,"I've been doing this program for about a week and love it so far. This is the first Beachbody program I actually WANT to do. Chalene is a wonderful instructor and very encouraging. I love that there is a lot of upper body work and that weights are used in most of the workouts. I feel like most Beachbody workouts focus on lower body and this one is upper body, which I wanted. I really love the workout on the 3rd day, I believe it's Burn Intervals, where you do a HIIT/ plyo move and follow it up with a challenging 2-3 minutes of constant lifting with light weights. Loving this program so far and I am excited to continue.",1493596800,,626,4.225
3725775,3,B001O2MWGI,I love the workouts but the aqua blue exercise band broke the first time I used it. Very annoying.,1492473600,,98,4.2105263157894735
3725776,1,B001O2MWGI,"The program itself is good. But these DVDs look bootleg. I'm convinced that the seller bought the program and made several subpar copies. Even the booklet that comes with it looks bootleg. Faded, words cut off-obviously copied.",1490572800,3,227,5.162162162162162
3725777,5,B001O2MWGI,"This is one of the best workout programs. Chalene is always amazing and motivating and in this program she really pushes you. If you do the work and lift heavy you will see incredible results. This was my first program after having my fifth baby and I saw results fast. Since then I've moved on to Piyo and Insanity programs but I always come back to Chalene Extreme to lift. It's as if you have a trainer right there, correcting your form and encouraging you. I highly recommend it. This will always be a foundation in my workouts.",1490227200,,532,4.438775510204081

3725781,5,B001O2MWGI,Love chalean extreme. Always go back to this workout. I love lifting heavy weights. I also recommend getting dumbbells to go along with this workout for maximum effectiveness. Chalene is one of the best in the beachbody business.,1484784000,2,229,5.052631578947368

3725792,5,B001O2MWGI,"I've done each of the workouts once to see what it's like.  Initially, it was difficult to move slowly, as the workout requires after doing strength training with relatively fast movement, but after 2-3 workouts, I adjusted.  I'm looking forward to doing the 90 day program and believe that I will end up much stronger afterwards.  I have two complaints which are pretty small: 1 - every workout has nearly the identical warm-up.  There is a little variation of the warm-up for the ""cardio"" workouts, but it's pretty much identical for all the strength workouts.  2 - the compound movements in the third (Lean) phase can be kind of tricky (working upper and lower body at the same time such as doing squats while also doing biceps, etc.).
I'd definitely recommend this workout set to anyone who is looking for a strength training program.",1483401600,,838,4.791666666666667

3725801,4,B001O2MWGI,"I have to start by saying this: If you don't think Chalene gives enough tips on form you must have muted your television.  She talks about form the entire time!  I greatly appreciate it because this workout is chock full of squats and lunges, which have always caused me pain, but now I learned how I was doing them incorrectly.  Doing them with the correct form means no strain and no pain.
I am only wrapping up my first 30 days (the Burn Phase) and while I DO not weigh myself, I have to admit that I have definitely lost inches.  My upper arms have slimmed down, my thighs and my calves have toned up, my biceps are rocking and my deltoids are gorgeous!  Yes - I, too, like many stated, have been a little bit missing my cardio - but my plan is to hit the cardio hard once these 90 days are over.  You DO still get some cardio with the HITT as well as the once-a-week 30 minute cardio DVD.  Is it enough? - no.  However, I also have to say that the first 7-10 days I was on this I could not have done any more cardio simply because I was pushing myself HARD with these weight-lifting workouts.  Slow and heavy was she said, so it's what I did.  I found myself crashing to sleep each night exhausted.  Now my body has adjusted and I'm getting ready to start the Push Phase.  I'll come back and leave a report after I've completed the program, but yes - Chalene is motivating, real, and does a good job teaching you HOW to work out.",1458518400,9,1434,4.155797101449275

3725806,3,B001O2MWGI,"The work out looks pretty good. Its very slow and intense. I found other weight training videos too fast with the lifting & momentum, and it was hard to keep up so I really like how she goes over proper form and makes it easy to learn resistance training. My only concern is her eating guide. I found it out dated and she actually gives her children artificial sweeteners! I was kind of shocked that she had her daughter making a recipe with diet jello and diet pudding that contains aspartame that is directly linked to brain tumors! My mother was a big aspartame fan and she died from a brain tumor. Chalene advocates a low fat diet and I felt like I was in the 80's again with her low fat recipes. She needs to come up to 2015 with good fats and low sugar that doesn't mean you replace it with sucralose (causes anxiety and depression and lord knows what else if you give that to children!?) and aspartame. Maybe some parents think if its sold in the stores its ok to eat. Yeah.. so did my mother, who's dead now from aspartame.",1450656000,9,1031,4.292307692307692

I have had back surgery, suffer with Degenerative Disk Disease so 7 of my disks are completely flattened and herniated causing extreme pain all the way down to my toes on a constant basis. I've had ACL replacement surgery and suffer with arthritis from all my bone and joint issues and past surgeries. I've lost 45 pounds and 2.5 dress sizes on my own through changing my diet, reversing my insulin resistence, exercising and weight training on my own. I started this workout today after taking a few weeks off from working out due to my back. This workout is a beast!! However, unlike when I work out on my own - I am now sore in all of the RIGHT places instead of the crippling ones!  True story. I was only able to get through the first several minutes out of the 30! I was sweating and ready to puke and felt more worked out than I do when I'm doing my own routine and yet hadn't done as much as I normally do! The brilliance is in the fluidity and sequence of movements and reps! That's something I couldn't have mastered on my own.

Chalean is an upbeat and motivating trainer, but I found the instruction lacking  here she didn't give a lot of tips on form and I was left trying to figure out my posture while holding a significant amount of weight, risk for injury.

I started off with just a set of 3 lb and 10 lb dumbells and a few resistance bands. The resistance bands are actually really, really tough - but you have to get a few so you're getting different resistance levels for the different exercises.

When I go into things thinking I'm gonna hate it not surprisingly I usually do l. I actually thought about not doing despite spending over a hundred dollars. I doubted the difficulty, I was doubtful because of how short they were. I thought they might be ""made for girls"" ie less difficult  I considered doing p90x again. I'm so glad I didnt.
Let me say I can't review the workouts as a whole program. I am doing a hybrid program with insanity so I can only comment on the workouts as individual workouts.
They are tough. I am lifting pretty much as heavy as Charlean and by doing that my body is sore! More than with most workouts. Also they are nice and short but still effective. I like charleans personality. She doesn't annoy me even though she's bubbly. I like the other people for the most part. I think the workouts are shockingly effective.

I can't wait to take check my weight and inches again once I finish phase 2.  If you follow this plan and eat every 2 1/2 to 3 hours with a good diet you will see results. I have tried several other programs and have found this one to be my favorite with great results so far.  I just ordered Chalean extreme deluxe ugrade which comes with the stability ball, hand weighed gloves, seven additional workouts, etc.  I am going to incorporate the additional dvd's in my lean for life plan to help me switch it up when I am done with all three phases.

One day there was shorts with letters on the butt, and lots of cleavage. The next workout, she came out in knee high boots. Who wear's that lifting heavy? I am upset that I wasted my money on these dvd's. There is definitely not enough cardio so you will need to add cardio. you might want to do a chalene/insanity hybrid or one of the other BB products. Which means spending even more money. I know lifting doesn't burn a lot of calories but burning only 80 calories is just not cutting it. Save your money and by something else. I am sure you can do bicep curls without spending $100 +. Don't waste your money",1422489600,7,922,4.244318181818182

I've been doing this workout for several months and see real results.  Chalean's knowledge and upbeat attitude get you committed to work out daily and the results come pretty quickly.,1412553600,3,310,5.844444444444444
3725835,3,B001O2MWGI,"I generally hate doing weight training, which is why I need a consistent program that makes me do it! I ordered this after talking with a PiYo instructor, and I've been very happy with it. I'm in month 2 and I've only missed 1 workout so far.

The Good: Chalene is a great motivator, and she does a good job giving beginners appropriate weight ranges. I thought I'd be incredibly sore but I really haven't been. The workouts are challenging but I love that we are focusing on 12 reps (in month 1) and only 8 reps (in month 2), which makes it feel doable. It's hard but not impossible. Chalene talks a lot about proper form and safety and gives consistent reminders. I really enjoy the weight workouts--which is a HUGE deal considering how much I absolutely hated weight training before.

The best thing I can say is that I'm so much stronger! It's been six weeks and I really feel a difference. My arms look WAY more toned and I've lost around my waist. I went from using 6 pound weights on arm exercises at the beginning (I was truly a beginner) to 9-12, and I'm about halfway through the program! It's amazing to see that it feels easier each week, and I was surprised at how quickly I could increase the weight. I can do a few pushups on my toes now, and I hope that by the end of the 3 months I'll be able to do lots more!

The Not-So-Good: The production quality is ""eh"", especially for the first month's workouts. The sound is muffled and the camera man wanders around. The music is truly TERRIBLE and I'm not really picky about music...but it seriously sounds like a friend with a keyboard laid down some tracks in the basement. Neither of these makes me like the workout less, but frankly for the cost, I would expect a higher production quality.

My biggest dislike is the cardio workouts. There are only 2 provided, which you are supposed to do twice a week for three months. The cardio workouts are utilitarian drill-style workouts. They get the job done. They are not fun in the slightest, and they are incredibly boring. I also really dislike that one of the ""cardio"" workouts uses light weights at high repetitions... I'm already doing 3 really tough weight workouts a week, so I don't want to do 45 minutes of weights while I do my cardio too, thanks very much. I think there should be more variety of cardio--maybe 3-5 total cardio workouts that you could rotate throughout the 3 months. I did do the free Turbo Jam one, which is better, but it's not really part of the program.

It does require that you invest in weights, but I think that's to be expected when weight training! Overall, I'm very happy with my results and I actually enjoy the weight training sessions. That is no small feat. I am supplementing with my own cardio options. This program is great for someone like me who needs the motivation and doesn't know where to start with weight training. I really like it!

UPDATE: I finished the third month, and while I really did like the first 2 months, I HATED month 3. It is really puzzling why the first two months the program focuses on 8-12 reps, but the third month is endless reps. The Lean 1 workout should be called Bicep Curls for 45 Minutes, because that's all it is. Biceps while lunging, biceps while standing, breakdown with biceps. Triceps and...back to biceps. You just spent 2 months telling me that we don't have to do a lot of reps to get results, and now for some reason we are doing 100 reps. And Chalene, bless her heart, talks every single second of it. She literally never shuts up the entire time for one blessed moment. You can tell how I feel about Month 3. When I go back and do the workouts from months 1 and 2, I still like those a lot, so I'll keep doing them. I still hate the cardio DVDs and will never, ever do those again.",1411689600,29,3784,4.398571428571429

Love that the workout total time is posted at the very beginning so you know how long you are going to workout.  Love the ticker clock that tells how much time you're spending on each exercise.  Love the REP counter too as I focus more on my 4 count up and 4 count down to pay attention to the rep too is too much!  I'm sure that slow pace will come easier as I get more into the workouts but for now that clock and rep counter really help.  I am no stranger to weight training as I've been doing Firm Express for years (off and on and then eventually more off....).  I love the focus on weight training and not so much cardio bopping all the time.  I'm using freeweights during my workouts and not the resistance bands (they scare me!).  I seriously love the positive attitude and encouragment every step of the way too!  She's like my personal cheerleader during every workout.  I had good intentions of following the meal plan that's included as most of the food does look ""normal"" but as of yet I haven't been that strict.  I picked a few recipes out to try for supper this week but haven't made them yet.  I know if I want to see amazing super results I need to follow the meal plan as achieving weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise.  This program was just what I needed to get me out of my exercise rut.  I'm so happy with my purchase and can't wait to see the results at the end of the 90 days.  Even tho I'm only in the 2nd week, I do feel stronger in my arms, shoulders and back (main focus during this phase).  I think it's fair to mention I am supplementing all the weight training with a noon cardio workout (Turbo Jam 20 min workout) during my work week.  What a blast!",1410480000,8,1855,4.174647887323943

Despite this, I lost 14 lbs; 3"" from my waist; 3.5"" from my hips and 1.5"" from my thigh.  This is by far the most significant reduction in size I have experienced with any other program.

I called beachbody to have them send me one and they said they would but it never came.  Also, one of the DVDs was not coded for North America and does not work in my DVD player.

I saw the best physical results from this one and found the time commitment very reasonable (35-50 minutes per workout). The majority of the workouts focus on lower and upper body and her system gets you to challenge yourself with different size weights. I think this is the perfect workout for women of ALL ages and she provides modifications for those that want to do a lower impact. For me, Charlene does move fast and I am often putting it on pause because they have finished the set and are moving on to the next one and I want to complete my full set. Also, all of the warm-ups are the same, very redundent. Those are both minor complaints compared to the GREAT workouts, so I would highly recommend this.",1390867200,7,949,4.307262569832402

3725849,4,B001O2MWGI,"I did this workout prior to this purchase.  Then decided to purchase it to do it again and to get the complete program, nutrition guide, etc.  This didn't come with the bands, as stated. I was okay with that because I didn't use the bands anyways, or if you have bands from another program, you can use those.  I got this, it was scratched up, missing the nutrition guide, the calandar for the workouts and bonus dvd.  I did contact the seller that gave me a refund.

The actual workout, in my opinion is great!  It combines weightlifting in 3 different phases, the Burn month, moderate weight with 10-12 reps, Push month, (heavier weights, 6-8 reps each) and Lean month moderate, 10-12 reps. These are done 3x per week and also has cardio/strength training, ab work and a recharge day/ stretching. There is also 2 days per week of rest.  There is supposed to be a nutritional guide book that tells you how to calculate calories needed so you can get the best results which is extremely important, but I do not know what is in that.  Overall, if the program is brand new, not opened and includes everything, this is a great way to introduce yourself to weight lifting/toning your body for both men and women.  I will be going directly thru Beachbody for the program to ensure it is completely there, or keep an eye out for a new in box item on Amazon.",1388361600,3,1351,4.459349593495935

3725873,3,B001O2MWGI,"I don't care what anyone says...if you lift weights heavy (or as Chalean says...""Go heavy or go home!"") you're going to thicken up.  And that's what happened to me.

I had high hopes for this workout program because it's not physically taxing/difficult like the P90X or Insanity Workouts and it's not super long (under 40 minutes for most of the workouts) and you only workout 5 days a week (vs. 6 days with other Beach Body programs).

So, I really wanted this workout to work for me.  But it didn't.

Just to be clear, I'm not one that works out to ""lose weight.""  I've learned years ago that you can't have a scale tell you whether you look good or not.  I'm 38 and 5'8"".  My lowest body weight was 139 (by using prescription Phentermine pills) and I felt TOO THIN.  I certainly didn't look good in a mirror either.  I was flabby and gross.  So, no, I don't use solely a scale to tell me if I'm successful with a weight loss program or not.

But what bothered me about this program (and I've done it twice), is that after using it I started to notice within the first few weeks that I was getting THICKER.  During the video, she keeps saying how building muscle doesn't bulk you up.  BUT IT DOES!!  I don't care what she says.

My pants weren't fitting anymore.  I was going in the wrong direction!  Instead of fitting in my size 8 jeans better, I was finding that my pants were getting tighter and I had to go up into a size 10!  Wrong direction to go into when doing a workout program.  They were fitting tighter in the legs (and not in the waist so much) and my shirts were fitting tighter in the arm area.  This meant that my thighs were getting thicker from the many squats and lunges she had me do and I was finding that I had to buy bigger pants while my arms were getting thicker, requiring size XL shirts instead of L (since I'm a little busty and need bigger shirts anyway).  And that's completely unacceptable.

So, I stopped doing the workouts.

Instead, I started doing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/INSANITY-DVD-Workout/dp/B002QZ1RS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">INSANITY DVD Workout</a>.  This workout is incredible and I wrote a lengthy review about it.  The fat just started melting off in a way that no other workout has ever worked for me.  Yes, it's hard.  Yes, it's addicting.  But hell yes, your pants will get LOOSER instead of the other way around.  And pretty damn fast, too!  (Like in the first couple of weeks you'll notice a difference!)

I do like Chalean.  She's motivating and sweet.  Yet what I didn't like is that the workouts quickly get boring, if you're going as heavy as she keeps screaming then it becomes taxing on the knees (especially when doing lunges or squats, which she does A LOT of), and my legs were getting thicker, which I didn't like AT ALL!  I don't want bigger pants.  I want smaller pants.  I believe that's probably the direction you probably want to go in too unless you're looking for bodybuilder legs.

Overall I found the program to be not challenging and borderline cheesy. If you are use to Shaun T, CL simply doesn't cut it. I did not feel my cardio endurance was maintained.

3725891,5,B001O2MWGI,"This is one of the beachbody programs that do not get a lot of press, but I actually like it more than the original P90x program.  Here are some of my thoughts.

1) Like p90x it is a 90 day program, but personally I do not get as bored with this one than with p90x because you get new lifting workouts each month, and there is not as much repetition as with p90x.

2) The workouts are short.  They last from about 30-45 min give or take, while many P90x workouts clock in at around an hour to hour and a half.  If you don't have as much time this may be a better option.

3) You will be lifting heavy weights.  You may get bulkier in the first couple months, but you have to stick all the way through to lean out.  The first couple months focus on lifting very heavy weights, and depending on your metabolic rate and yes (what you eat) you may get bulky.  The third month is the lean phase where you do more reps with lighter weight and will lean down.  If you freak out in the first couple months because you are getting too ""big"" then you are not going to get the intended results.

4) There is some, but not a ton of cardio in this program.  If you are a cardio junkie, you may want to supplement this with a couple extra workouts.  If you hate cardio, then you may really like this program because there are just a couple cardio workouts in the base program and they are relatively short.

Obviously the best workout for you is one you can stick with.  Some people cannot get into DVD workouts at all, and others have very strong preferences for a particular program.  I cannot tell you what will be the best for you, but I personally think this is a good program.  You have to be very careful ordering these programs from Amazon.  Many third party sellers jack up the price and give you bootlegged copies without all the documentation and missing DVDs.  I suggest going through beachbody to get it.",1343692800,42,1903,4.236111111111111
3725892,5,B001O2MWGI,"I started my journey to get fit a little over 90 days ago.  My first month I started with TurboJam.  It was a great beginner kick-off for me but I found that I needed a bigger challenge pretty quickly.  I moved on to TurboFire and absolutely love the program.  The HIIT training keeps me pushing myself but I wasn't losing the weight and inches that I thought I would.  I should state that I am also following Weight Watchers so I am strictly tracking my caloric intake.

I have never tried a strength training program before but love Chalene Johnson and was excited to find Chalean Extreme.  This program has made a huge difference for me.  I just started month 2 the ""Push"" circuit and my life has changed.  You will develop muscle quickly if you truly push yourself on this program.  There are a lot of comments out here about how this program isn't for beginners and I disagree.  The program is phased so that you can start out as a complete novice and see great benefits.  I still have some fat to burn off but I can feel huge differences in  my muscle tone and definition.  I have progressed to lifting weights that are 50% to 100% heavier in just a month's time.  My confidence is soaring and I actually look forward to working out.  Now that is a statement I NEVER thought I'd make.

I do agree with the reviewers who state that this program needs more cardio.  I have combined this with TurboFire and think it's a great balance.  On my strength training days I start with a 15 or 20 minute HIIT workout as a warmup and on non-strength training days I do a full 45-60 minute TurboFire cardio session.  I work out 6 days per week.

3725899,5,B001O2MWGI,"Here's a little bit of my history.  Before having my son at 40, I was in great shape and really thin.  After having him and going back to my physical job, I was right back where I wanted to be.  I made a life change and became a stay at home mom.  Shortly after that, I had a hysterectomy.  I gained about ten pounds I couldn't get rid of.  I was starving myself and exercising with no real results.  In fact, I did P90X twice.  I knew my eating habits were partly to blame but found P90X's meal plan unaffordable and labor intensive.

As a last ditch effort, I ordered Chleane Extreme.  After completing the program and following, what I consider to be a realistic and affordable meal plan, I have lost inches.  I have dropped a bra size, my pants fit better, and I am getting ripped.  Keep in mind that I was going for ""fitness model"" type results!  I didn't have a lot of weight to loose which almost makes it more difficult!  I am so pleased with this program.  I am beginning to feel good about how I look again.

3725901,5,B001O2MWGI,"First of all, let me say that pre-ChaLean Extreme, I was a 20-year-old ex-show choir kid who was by no means overweight, but definitely sort of soft everywhere, not to mention short (5 '2') and pale, so in other words, not pleased with my body. I weighed about 138-140 pounds. Before ChaLean, I did Beachbody's Insanity once (followed it pretty well and tracked what I ate but not actual cals) and P90X (also followed it pretty well and tracked cals). While I do think Insanity conditioned me for hard labor, something I was previously VERY unfamiliar with, it didn't help me lose any weight/see much results. Same goes for P90X, in which I think I only reduced my weight to 135 pounds.

Lo and behold, I found out about ChaLean Extreme. Not gonna lie, when I started the program I didn't think I'd see much in terms of results. Because it was a weight training program similar (and, arguably, easier in terms of management) to P90X, I think I had convinced myself that I was at my ""ideal"" weight.

I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG.

Almost a year later and I'm coming close to finishing (just started the Lean Circuit) my second time doing ChaLean (following the diet religiously the first time and relaxing it slightly the second time--1500 cals a day, more freebies on the weekends, so like 1800 then) and I have lost ABOUT 25 POUNDS.
Weighed in yesterday at about 113, which can fluctuate to 115. I have also lost inches EVERYWHERE, especially my arms (which are now cut), and have reduced my body fat from 23% to 18% (gotta work on my Italian booty still a little bit).

When people, mostly female friends of mine, ask me about my workout program because they all have witnessed the incredible change that has taken place with my body, I tell them this: don't be afraid to lift! Most girls my age are obsessed with cardio, and while it is a necessary part of any workout, they are all way too hesitant--like I was--to go for the gold and LIFT HEAVY in order to get that muscle BURNING fat.

This is why I think Insanity and P90X didn't work for me--Insanity is mostly cardio-based and having never been an athlete, my body didn't respond as well as some others, and with P90X women are not really encouraged more than once to try and fatigue their muscles. ChaLean is the real thing. She will cheer you on toward your goals, and as for the people who find her annoying, I have to politely disagree. I liked Shaun-T in Insanity and loved the goofiness Tony Horton brought to P90X, but nothing has been more motivating for me than seeing an aging gracefully woman like Chalene, with a normally proportioned body (unlike her sister Janelle, haha--that gazelle!), truly connect and try to motivate her key demographic, WOMEN, with what really works.

All of that being said, I do have one teeny-tiny complaint about ChaLean, but it really has more to do with me than the program. I often substitute a different form of cardio or skip the Burn it Off! & Recharge day (all my fault), and in order to target the really tough areas (saddlebags) and lengthen my new lean muscles, I was thinking of incorporating 2-3 days a week, with ChaLean, the Ballet Beautiful DVD from Mary Helen Bowers:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Transform-Your-Body-and-Gain-the-Strength-Grace-and-Focus-of-a-Ballet-Dancer/dp/0738215902/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Transform Your Body and Gain the Strength, Grace, and Focus of a Ballet Dancer</a>
ChaLean has made me lean, but now I want to be as long and lean as possible (and also get a little bit more flexibility without doing yoga or pilates).

So to all you Amazonians out there, I'm posing two questions:
1) Do you think Ballet Beautiful would be a good addition to my ChaLean regimen? Let me add that I will have more time once I've graduated from college in about a month and a week.
2) I mentioned I did ChaLean twice. Are you supposed to repeat the program over and over again or just, once finished, do the Lean for Life phase? I know I'll be doing this workout for years either way!

If someone has any thoughts/suggestions/answers, I'd love to hear it! Thanks and good luck,

I have been using the push month circuits which for the first time in my life has really pushed me to use heavier weights. I exercise regularly with cardio and strength training in the past.

Just the 30 minutes push circuits (month 2) are worth the money..",1323043200,3,519,4.252525252525253

The ads at the start and at the end of the programs are also quite annoying.

3725918,4,B001O2MWGI,"I am a p90x, insanity and asylum user and this review is geared toward others who love these programs.

I thought it would be fun to add some more workouts to my routine, so I ordered Chalean Extreame after watching a number of videos about the product.

The program is package beautifully and contains a lot of good information.  I think it's a very worthwhile program.  Like the other programs that I mentioned, you will lose weight if the perimeters are followed.

When I ordered this I thought it would follow the same course as p90x or insanity.  While many of the exercises are good and there is some intensity, I found the delivery to be a ""jazzercise"" type feel.

Insanity and p90X are real world workouts where the people in the videos drop out or change the amount of weights during the exercise, because of the intensity.  They certainly don't keep a plastered on smile across their face throughout the routine. The exercisers in Chalean Extreme do and I can't stand it.

There are other reasons along these same lines that turned me off to the program.

The videos I saw of the program were different than the actual program.  If I had seen cuts from the actual workout videos, I would not have purchased the program.

So if you are a p90x junkie or insanity/asylum fitness crazy view clips from the actual exercise videos, then decide if it's right for you.

I started my weight loss journey in 2008 and slowly started incorporating exercise.  I started off with the 30 day Shred and other Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner DVD's and started seeing some results. In the fall of 2010 my husband and I started P90X.  I completed 90 days and had some good results. ( I did the lean phase not the classic.)  I was going to do a second round of P90X but was not feeling it due to the time consuming workouts.  My cousin told me about Chalean Extreme so I decided to give it a try.  I am so happy that I did.  The workouts are way less time consuming but very effective.  I just started the lean phase and it is very challenging.  I have burned alot more fat because of this workout.  I have not lost weight, (I am not dieting and I did not give up alcohol), but I have definately seen fat burning results and have really built muscle.  I really believe that muscle burns fat!  It has worked for me for sure.",1309392000,12,1038,4.109452736318408

I hoped that it would help me to tone up and lose some of the weight I gained over the winter (overall I would like to lose about 15 lbs).

I have just started the second week of the final phase (Lean Phase). While I have definitely toned up somewhat, I haven't lost any weight at all - in fact I gained a pound. I feel stronger but since my primary goal was weight loss, I am disappointed.

I just started my 2nd month.  I try to follow a diet of eating right but don't always so I'm not losing weight.  I am however noticing more muscle in my arms, stomach and thighs.  Today I purchased Turbo Fire so I hope to do 3 days Turbo Fire and 3 days ChaLEAN to get some fat off my body.

This is a great program! I do have Insanity and did it for about 3 weeks but lost interest.  Not that it's a bad program, it just wasn't for me.  ChaLEAN Extreme is for me and I actually look forward to working out especially since I can feel my muscles now.

So you if you like Turbo Jam and want to add some strength training to your workout, try this.  It is a great program and Chalene is awesome!",1305244800,11,698,3.9285714285714284
3725925,4,B001O2MWGI,"I finally invested in ChaLean Extreme after I have spent the last 3 years whittling my weight down from over 200 lbs to the mid-150s. (I am a 5'7 female, age 29.)

Most of my exercise during that period consisted of a lot of walking and proceeded to dance classes and higher intensity cardio for the most part, with some yoga thrown in. I discovered the Turbo Jam dvds in all of their kinda-cheesy-but-fun glory and realized after a little while that I had hit that infamous plateau that people in my situation often do once they lose the majority of the extra weight.

Let me preface this by saying that I already ate pretty darn healthy before starting ChaLean Extreme: 5 small meals a day, lots of lean protein, fruits and veggies, complex carbs in moderation, little to no refined sugar, etc. And water. LOTS of water. It accounted for the majority of my weight loss up until that point. The meal plans that come with the program also operate more or less off of these same principles, so it wasn't difficult for me to stick to. (Just remember, weight loss is about 80% what/how you eat, 20% exercise.)

I realized that the time had come for me to really push myself and start toning so that I could get the last 15 or 20 lbs off to reach my goals.

There IS definitely a substantial investment to be made if you do this program. You have the option to use resistance bands for this program, but I preferred the idea of using straight-ahead weights.

The SelectTech adjustable weights used in the videos are just too darn pricey for my liking, so I did some research and invested in the far cheaper Power Block adjustable weight set (purchased on Amazon), 2 hand weights that each range from 6 lbs to 24 lbs. Given that I've never done weight training and had pretty much the upper body strength of a T-Rex, I figured it'd be enough for my first round of the program. I was right.

My internet research while I awaited the arrival of my program revealed to me that you MUST be willing to add more cardio than what is assigned in this program during the week in order to obtain extreme results in how your body looks if you've got any real amount of weight to lose and you're not just looking to firm up.

Therefore, I took to adding the Turbo Jam ""Fat Blaster"" workout (included as a bonus on one of the discs only 30 minutes long, but REALLY high intensity) several times a week along with the scheduled weight training in each phase.

I also felt like the scheduled ab workouts weren't frequent enough for me and they were so short that I added in a couple of extra times per week of them, on non-consecutive days.

Trainers often say that you should do weights before cardio so that you have full strength and stamina for your lifting, but I actually found the opposite to be true for me. These weight workouts worked me SO hard that I'd be too tired to do my cardio after.

I didn't really care for the ""recharge"" stretching workout, so I substituted with a similar length yoga DVD routine that I liked. (Stretching is vital during this program.) I also did short additional yoga whenever I could fit in the time or felt like I needed the extra stretch to help my muscle soreness.

Overall, I found the program an excellent introduction to weight training. Chalene is considerably more laid-back and subdued (but still sassy) than in her Turbo Jam DVDs. She is encouraging, supportive, and her banter with her support cast doesn't cross the line into fake-perky and obnoxious. They really make you feel like you can push yourself more than you thought you could, which is what really gets you the results you want. There is a lot of emphasis on proper and safe form, which is crucial.

I enjoyed it and looked forward to doing it on every scheduled day.

For me, waking up earlier in the morning to do it right after giving myself time to digest a light breakfast was most effective, letting me get it done and get on with my day.

I could feel progress extremely quickly and felt myself growing stronger every day. It amazed me how quickly 6 lbs in one hand felt light as my ever-present glass of water.

Overall, I lost about 7 or 8 lbs during the course of the 3 months (and that's with only being able to do about half the workouts during to schedule demands during the final phase... I'll be redoing the Lean Phase this month to compensate) but the biggest change has been in how my body LOOKS.

My shoulders and back are far more toned and for the first time in my adult life, I don't really have ""bingo wings"" anymore!

My quads and calves have never been so strong and toned. My waist is trimmer, my stomach flatter, and my butt is considerably rounder, firmer, and higher! I can do pushups on my toes (not a ton, but I couldn't do any before!) for the first time in my life.

It has made me brave enough to buy my very first bikini.

I couldn't be more pleased and plan to continue with the maintenance schedule suggested once I finish my re-do of the Lean phase. I have no doubt that this will work for those that do the work honestly and with dedication.

You can't expect a hard body without hard work, and this program is a great way to get there.

I would strongly suggest ordering directly from Beachbody, however, as many have reported that some sellers on Amazon will sell a bootleg version that doesn't include the needed thigh toning band, body fat calipers, resistance band, or all of the weighty nicely-made supplemental reading material that you NEED. Some of these sellers on Amazon will give pathetic little faked tiny pamphlets instead.

3725927,5,B001O2MWGI,"I've read a couple reviews of people whining this isn't hard at all, this isn't extreme blah blah blah. Sure, it's not like Insanity commercials or as ""extreme"" (ie: so hardcore and fast paced you have no energy left after your 1 hour endorphin high is gone) as P90X but I am BURNING and so so sore after a workout! It's not super fast paced, testosterone charged and such as P90X but it's hard none the less! You can do this workout, get results, feel the burn AND still have energy leftover!!
I've only done one other home workout DVD system, P90X. Did it for about 1 1/2 years, from 6 weeks postpartum and til about 2 months after I had my 2nd baby. I have my 2 children 14 months apart and I wore my size 2 jeans the WHOLE pregnancy so we know P90X works. I was thinking Chalean wouldn't be hard enough but it really works. I can say I've seen MORE muscle definition from her program hoenstly. I think it's more suited to a woman's body, not so much push up/pull up crap that women don't really like. I felt like ALL I did was work my back in P90X, really what woman cares about her back? It's legs for women and I feel I get a lot of leg work in this one. Workouts are shorter, I have energy leftover afterward, and it's easy to work in running to this routine. The workouts reminded me of BodyPump and I loved that class.
And Chalene isn't annoying in the least! She actually HELPS you out. Her friends in the videos aren't annoying at all either and she doesn't flirt with any of them (if any of you have done P90X you know what I'm talking about - gag!!).
I would honestly recommen this video to any female friends who are busy enough as it is. If you pick heavy weights, do the workouts slow and UP your weights after a few weeks you'll see results.",1304467200,76,1758,4.188790560471976
3725928,5,B001O2MWGI,"It is a wonderful DVD if you are goal oriented.  There is a 3 month calendar to tick off every day (I copied the one in the book into excel and printed it out), and you can see yourself progressing to heavier weights.  I really like having a plan to my workouts, to make sure that I hit every part of the body.  The guidebook provided is not great for recording the weights that you use.  However, you can print a worksheet from teambeachbody website following the menu: get fit > fitness tools > workoutsheet; this is essential to track your weights and reps.  Although they also use bands in the DVD, it is worth investing in a set of weights.  I am a small women, but quickly realized that I was going to need weights that went up to 25lb each.  The Jillian Michaels 25lb adjustable weights work well for me.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-Ultimate-25-Pound-Adjustable-Speed-Dumbbell/dp/B0045GPUPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels Ultimate 25-Pound Adjustable Speed Dumbbell</a>

There is focus on using good form to prevent injury.  The set does lack sufficient cardio by itself, so I combine with some other DVDs and an exercise bike.  There is a 30 minute TurboJam cardio workout included.  However, for toning and weight training this is really wonderful.  For me cardio is the easier piece to do by myself, I use an exercise bike.  I am halfway through and plan to start the plan over again once I finish it.  Chalean is motivating, and keeps it interesting.

Overall worth the money.  I have used personal trainers in the past and find this almost as effective provided I push myself.  It is expensive to set up DVD set plus weights, but much cheaper than a regular personal trainer.  For those reviewers who say the program is too easy, you need to increase the weights you are lifting!

Update: After finishing my first round of the 3-month program I have lost 10lb on the scale and built lovely muscle all over (abs, legs and arms), losing 11 inches. It is extremely important to measure yourself every month, as laid out in the program.  When building muscle the scale might not go down much but you will get leaner.  Muscle weighs more than fat!

3725933,5,B001O2MWGI,"Chalean Extreme was at the top of my Christmas list in 2010 and on Valentine's day 2011, to honor myself, I started the Burn Phase.  I was hesitant to try this program knowing I'd need to figure out what weights work best so that you fail between your 10th-12th rep of each exercise but now in week 2, I totally get it.  Chalene teaches you how to gauge yourself and even how to make the weights feel heavier than they really are. I've been following Leilee the ""beginner"" workout person on the Burn dvd's and already in week 2 I can add 2-3lbs more than I was using in week 1.  I have a set of weights that range from 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 lbs and this is great for a beginner.  I'm ready to buy a set of 15 and ultimately my goal is to lift 20-25 lbs by the end of the program.  In fact, I'm going to order the Powerblock weights on Amazon, primarily to save on space and cost in the long run.
What's awesome about this program is that each weightlifting workout is relatively short, 30-38 minutes each, the cardio sessions are about 45-50 minutes each and the abs workouts 10-15 minutes each.  The workouts are super fun and what's great is that you do so many different exercises it's hard to get bored. The thigh toner is a killer for such a flimsy thing!
I'm a runner and I cannot tell you enough how much stronger you become when you cross-train with weightlifting.  I'm a fan of P90x, Turbo Jam, and Jillian Michaels so on Tuesdays (one of the Burn phase off days) I usually do one of their cardio workouts or I run.  This allows me to torch even more calories. My goal is to get stronger, leaner and tone out and I'm pretty excited to see the final results.  I've lost only about 3 lbs. since starting the program, that's healthy for 2 weeks I'd say, and I'm working out so much I'm now focusing more on my eating habits.  The eating guide book has great and easy recipes and I love the fact that they list the nutrition facts for each one.
I've read a lot of consistent review's about Chalene not having great queuing when phasing into each exercise and although it's true, once you do the workout a few times you pick up on the moves so easily that you don't notice, or simply don't care 'cause you're too busy having so much fun.  I used to do the Firm workouts which are very structured and have excellent queuing but they weren't as fun as Chalene's workouts.  Chalene's got great energy and even if you're tired, just show up to your workout and before you know it, you'll be done and feeling awesome!
***update***
I just started the PUSH phase today with workout 1 and wow, was it funnn! I just ordered my power blocks to do my workouts with but while I await it's arrival, the heaviest weights I'm working out with are 12 pounders. I have to say after completing the Burn phase, I definitely feel stronger.  I've noticed that each week I am able to push myself further and harder and 12 pounds are no longer enough!! I'm trying to go for the intermediate range of weights in Push which would is a range of 12-22 pounds and I just know I'm gonna be able to handle the increased weight due to the strong base I've formulated in the Burn phase.  In the Push phase you go much slower then in the Burn phase, doing each workout with a total of 6-8 reps.
Sometimes, I find myself not wanting to lift weights first thing in the morning, so it's important I wake up early enough to let my body warm up naturally for a bit.  I haven't missed a workout yet and I don't regret it one bit.  It's critical to pay attention to your eating and keep up with the cardio if you want to see results fast.  Because I am pushing myself so hard with this workout, I want to see the results it's meant to provide so I'm slowly changing my eating habits to a more vegetarian/vegan diet (for life), and I push myself harder with my cardio intervals because I know I can. I feel so strong and empowered because of Chalean Extreme and I have to say my arms are finally getting that lean cuts around the bi's and tri's which is what I wanted out of this!!
**update**I just got my Powerblocks in and did the Push 1 video this morning with it and WOW! what a huge difference more weight makes.  Last week I was so bored with the work outs using 12 pound weights as my heaviest and was actually considering taking a break from the program until my blocks came in.  I thought I had plateaued.  After using the blocks today, I feel so strong! I went from 12 pounds to 25 pounds today and I failed at 6 and 7 reps on various exercises! I felt so relieved, and alive, and strrrrong!!! About 20 minutes after my workout, I thought my bi's and tri's were gonna explode! I'm rejuvenated and ready to hit up Push 2 on Wed.!  This program has pushed my fitness and nutritional level to a new horizon. Chalene mentions that she'll teach you to make the weights feel heavier when you don't have heavy weights on hand....please please please make the effort to invest in heavier weights or bands.  Don't wait til the last minute like I did to order mine.  You will want to stay on track with the program and feel the gains when you're meant to! The mental and physical benefits will payoff!

She will work you hard, but encourage you at just the right times. I haven't found her annoying at all - although sometimes the back up people can be a bit annoying, but I think that may be a personality flaw of mine. Her program does not bulk you up, but you will gain muscle and slim down.

It is unorganized... everybody is doing something different and it throws me completely off. The camera does not stay on one exerciser long enough to focus and learn the move.  Usually when a workout has different fitness levels they stay focused on the group so you can follow your level... but this just skips all over the place.  It's like a really bad gym class. No one keeps count... there is no cadence, and the music... totally uninspiring.  I gave it three stars because hopefully it will get better.

3725936,2,B001O2MWGI,"My initial Fall 2010 plan was the do the Chalean Extreme/Turbo Fire Hybrid (after finishing my 4th cycle of Insanity).  I was really excited as the Insanity program really got me hyped up and on the Beach Body wagon.  After I found the hybrid program on one of the forums of the TeamBeachBody website, I gave myself a start date and off I went.

After years of Jari Love weight training workouts and super intense cardio workouts (step, Insanity, HIIT, spinning, BODYattack), I found this hybrid program to fall all the way short.  I only got through 2 months and the whole time I was wishing I could switch programs.  My lack of enthusiasm had nothing to do with a lack of results (as weight loss isn't my highest priority goal).  It was more that when I'd finish each workout, I felt like I needed more.

Chalene seems great.  She's super fit, energetic, not overly bubbly and performs all her moves with good form and technique.  I'm sure she'd be awesome in a live class setting, too.  For the Chalean Extreme workouts, I just found that the level of difficulty was not high enough, even for someone like me (who does weight train but has more emphasis on intense cardio).  I see where she is going with the low rep/high weight progression to higher reps in the 3 phases.  And I also see where she is going with the use of compound exercises.  But I've just seen and tried other workouts with the same goal that are more effective.

I love the Jari Ripped series (particularly slim & lean, ripped to the core and ripped & chiseled).  I've also just purchased some Cathe Friedrich DVDs that are slowly becoming a new addiction.  I think Cathe, or even a blend of Cathe and Jari (particularly Cathe's slow & heavy series) will make for much more effective workouts than this Extreme series.

The one thing I did like though was the use of the resistance bands and I learned something new about how to use them for each of the muscle groups.  But I just think that the use of the word Extreme was an overstatement.  I think that this workout is geared towards those newbies to exercise that bought the DVDs from watching the infomercial or who were already followers of Chalene from Turbo Jam.  At least I know now that any of Chalene's DVDs will be at the beginner intermediate level and can recommend them to the appropriate people.",1293667200,20,2335,4.52744630071599

The work out program is good, however, if you are looking to lose a great amount of weight this may not be the one for you. Although I do know someone who says she lost over 100 lbs with this work out so results can be different from one another...

I was looking for a DVD to fill in until I had enough time for a second round of P90X, but ended up falling in love with this program!  Chalean is an awesome motivator.  I hadn't used her products before, since they look like they require coordination for dance moves (I dance like a wounded platypus), but Chalean Extreme was awesome.  I have 2 more weeks to go, and although I haven't lost a ton of weight (I didn't lose much in P90X either), my arms are sculpted, even at rest!  I got a lot more results with this program than any other I've tried.  In the final phase, she mentions that you will catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror and won't believe that that's YOUR body.  She was right - at 36, I'm in better shape now than I have EVER been.  Her program really does work!

3725947,4,B001O2MWGI,"I don't recommend this product if you are already an experienced, athletic person. It's geared more towards beginners and to the moderately trained persons. With that being said, it's not as if someone who does have workout experience couldn't gain from this system as well. I really enjoyed the ""Kitchen Makeover"" segment she included into the DVDs. Diet is just as important as the workouts themselves and even though a lot of workout programs add diet guides in their packages, none of them are quiet as thorough as this. She takes her time to explain to you why it's necessary to make changes in how you prepare your meals, and she also makes it easy if you have a large family to care for.
Even though the ""muscle burns fat"" approach is not a new idea, it's probably the most averted one. A lot of people think that it's all about the cardio. When you are a beginner at exercising your body, this system is absolutely perfect. You will gain the muscle necessary to jump-start your metabolism and before you know it your body will transform!
I am a huge fan. I do my own cardio at the gym or outside, mostly because you just don't get the full cardio benefits that your body needs from this system.  If you don't like running outside or hitting the gym, then find something easy that you can do at home.  I'm twenty-two years old and have never had the body that I have now. It's completely changed my entire shape. I haven't bulked up at all, if anything I have shrunk in that my body is much leaner and tighter. I went from over 25% body fat, down to 8%! I went from a flabby 120lbs to a very solid 103lbs. It's all muscle now! I wish I had found this system sooner!
I also recommend that you order from the BeachBody website directly, and that you look into investing in your own set of weights. The program included a resistance band(s), but I personally prefer free-weights. I purchased my own free-weights in various increments, so that I always had options and wasn't stuck with just one or two weight options.",1285113600,15,2021,4.4742547425474255

It is tough, but very effective and she is great at motivation.  Workouts are not too long to be overwhelming nor too hard to fit into a busy schedule.  After the three months, I gained a nice amount of muscle - not too much but nicely fit and toned.  Before this program I focused more on cardiovascular, which may be why I looked too thin in areas.

I was a P90X dropout because I felt like I wasn't getting the most of the workout because I was collapsed on the floor most of the time. I did some research and saw that ChaLEAN was a slightly less intense version of P90X so I bought it and I don't regret it. It was easier but that doesn't mean that it isn't hard. I loved it and how the progression of workouts blended so well as the weeks passed. I was actually excited to pop in the dvd at 4am everyday. I definitely saw results and I looked the best that I ever had in my entire life.

The equipment was simple and of course, being the poor college student that I am, I used what I had. I had a pair of customizable 20 pound ankle weights that I used as wrist weights, a pair of 10lbs, 5lbs, and 3lb dumbbells, and light, medium, heavy resistance bands for when makeshift weights just didn't cut it. I collected the equipment slowly overtime as I became stronger and as the workouts called for stronger weights. She gave you a schedule which was easy to follow. It was 5 days a week with two rest days, but the P90X-er in me managed to squeeze some P90X workouts in every once in awhile.

3725954,5,B001O2MWGI,"I've been working out/staying fit (usually running, weights, or circuit training) since my late teens, but had fallen out of lifting weights in last couple of years. And, as I'm now approaching 36 (we all lose muscle as we age), I could really tell a difference in my muscle tone and strength. So, I  for  was looking for something that focused more on weights - especially heavier weights - and this was/is perfect. It's critical to change up your routine every 4 weeks or so or your body just adapts to what you've been doing and you stop seeing results -- and this program addresses that really well. I know some reviewers said there needed to be more cardio, but I disagree - the program is designed to focus on weights to build muscle. Plus, the weight circuits really get your heart going and the cardio that is included is great (really tough, but fun). I think if you wanted to do more cardio for weight loss, you could easily add it to your routine after one (or more) of the shorter weight workouts. I'm in the last week of the first phase and I'm seeing some good results already. I'm not trying to lose weight, just get stronger/stay fit, but my measurements are down about an inch on my hips, abductors and waist - and, most importantly, my definition and strength is returning. I haven't followed the eating plan b/c I already have very healthy eating habits, but some of the recipes look good and I'll probably try some eventually. It looks relatively easy to follow, but more geared toward someone who is just beginning a healthy eating lifestyle, vs. someone who already has good habits and is aware of nutritional values. Overall, I really love it - Chalene is upbeat, but not annoyingly so, and easy to follow - gives great instruction on how to do the moves. My two complaints are that the sound on the first burn circuit is a little wonky - volume increases and lowers on its own in the first half - and the fat calipers are not worth a damn, but neither of those issues are that big of a deal to me. Regardless - I would definitely recommend this. Keeping muscle is soooo important to metabolism and there's much research out there that proves that heavier weights are the way to go - even for women (there's no need to worry about getting too ""big,"" it's just not gonna happen).

I started the program with adjustable weights that went from 2 lbs to 12 lbs I quickly out grew them and about half way thru the program I bought a pair of Bowflex select tech weight (they are expensive so I got a used pair on Craig's list). Don't be surprised if you need heavier weights quickly!

What I liked:

The lifting programs are great, if you go heavy you will feel it working and be sore the next day.

I liked having a mapped out program so It was easy to know what to do next.

Chalean is very motivating.

The longest program is about 46 min.

The ab workouts are awesome, very challenging.

I love the way my body looks!

What I did not like:

There are only two cardio workouts and I got bored with them quickly and mixed it up with other dvd's I had and running.

The warmup/cool down is very short so I would always do my own stretching.

I never did the full recharge dvd I found it boring, but then again I am not a yoga person.

I did not loose any weight but, weight loss was not my main goal... toning was. Plus I only made small changes to my diet and we all know diet is a HUGE factor in weight loss.

So over all I recommend it... the only reason I give it four stars is because of the lack of cardio workouts, I think there should have been at least three without having to buy the deluxe edition! Plus I am not so sure it is the best for weight loss, if you have a lot of weight to lose.

It was hard to stick to the workouts every day, but we did the best we could.  At the end of the 90 days, we had greater strength (I could curl 20lbs!)and my husband's upper body (chest/arms) were noticeably bigger and more cut.  We didn't lose much body fat, but that's because we have incredibly bad eating habits.
We have just started the 90 days again this week, with a goal to do better with the workouts and changing our diet.  I have high hopes, as I am also training for half marathons this spring/summer.
We really enjoy the workouts - yes, sometimes Chalene is a little obnoxious (what is up with those sick boots???) and I really would like to punch Skip in the face with his stupid comments.

3725979,5,B001O2MWGI,"I am a 6'1 280lb. former basketball player. After having my first child my weight shot up and I needed to find a way to workout that was not basketball due to the fact that I split ligaments on the left and right side of my left knee. Anyway, I started with Turbo Jam. I watched it for the longest time on infomercials dismissing it because it looked too dancy and not athletic enough for me who'd done Tae-Bo and Extreme Basketball Practice's for years. Boy was I wrong, I decided to buy it once my knee tore and it was the best idea I'd had with regards to my health in a very long time. It's very easy on my knee, and I burn over 1000 calories every workout! I love the music, the energy and Chalean!! So I decided to step it up after losing 25lbs. and try Chalean Extreme...WOW!! It's hard but not boring, it's short enough that it's do-able but you definitely need to add your own cardio. Other than that I LOVE IT!! If not for knowing better, I'd do it everyday, but I know my muscles need the time to relax. As for results-after the first week I've LOST 2lbs. (AMAZINGLY SINCE I'M INCREASING MUSCLE IN A MAJOR WAY!) and people who see me everyday are saying it looks like I've lost weight already! I know I've lost inches and I'm only in my 2nd week!!! WHOO HOO!! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!",1264636800,16,1293,4.176
3725980,5,B001O2MWGI,I have been doing this workout since the first of the year. So far I have lost 11 pounds and almost 15 inches total. Workouts are fun and challenging. I have not changed what I eat like I should but I am happy with how the changes are appearing.,1264550400,5,245,4.020408163265306
3725991,5,B001O2MWGI,"I am a at home video exerciser mostly because I can't afford a gym membership and while there's a gym at the College I attend, I am only there two days of the week most months of the year and it's just not convenient to go to the school on the days I don't have classes since I don't have a car. Since everyday I'm not in class, I'm working, so running around the city is very limited on those days if I want the proper amount of sleep. I was reluctant to invest in this program, but after some research on it I decided to give it a shot.

I started the Chalean Extreme program with over 100lbs to lose. To say the least, I'm a 30 year old 5' 4"" female weighing currently about 255 lbs, when I started Chalean's program I was 280 something lbs. On my last weight loss attempt a few years back, I started a DVD program that came with calendar of workouts, I lost weight (as I was watching my diet too) but I did it with long points of starving myself for meals. Eventually, I folded on my diet and decided I would be satisfied with my weight loss and eventually stopped exercising. Of course all the weight crept back. I say this all to say, what my old DVD program lacked Chalean Extreme has, an education in a way to live fit permanently. One of the most valuable things in this DVD program was Chalean's kitchen makeover DVD and her motivational CD, both of which educated me in thinking differently and knowing the changes I make have to be permanent if I want permanent results. It changed me from thinking there's a point where it's ""over"" and I can go back to old back habits. Even in the workout she reminds you of things that come up in her motivational CD and says ""see you tomorrow"". She emphasizes scheduling your exercising, which I do since I live by my written schedule.

I couldn't use her exact diet (the recipes), being a vegetarian for more than 10 years (yes a vegetarian can be over 200lbs, there's no meat in candy, cakes, white bread, pizza - one of my favorite things, and a long list of bad-for-you comfort foods). Even though I gave up meat less for healthy and more for ethical reason, I found being a vegetarian very helpful in easily adapting to a heathier 1500 calorie a day diet. But as I said, the value of this program isn't that it spoon feeds you a map to fitness, but that it teaches you values that will allow you to design your own map to fitness. The value of this program is beyond the workouts (even though that's the primary of the program).

The only thing that annoys me about the program is beachbody's constant advertising, you can start anything on the DVD without seeing their commercial inserts. Lay off with the advertisements beachbody. Also, sometimes Chalean and her crew seem more like they are dressed for the club than a serious day at the gym. I don't mind bra-style/sports bra style tops and short shorts as long as they look like gym clothes. When the ladies look too coordinated and their outfits are too bedazzled or ""shinny"" it becomes annoying (the one man always present usually wears a tank and either shorts or sweats).

As I progress in the program though, I have found that I'm able to do more than the Chalean workouts. It just hasn't felt like enough of a burn. As I enter the ""Push"" phase (almost at it's end currently) I have been adding other cardio/sculpting workouts to my lifting days as a sort of warm up workout and adding a workout to one of my rest days, I just holding off on the heavy lifting for Chalean's workouts. But as I said, the value of the Chalean program for me has been in it's education in fitness and diet and Chalean's continued encouragement to make it permanent. She's made me think differently about what I want out of life, not just about being ""skinny"". Her insistence on writing down goals and making things happen in life has extended into my College/Career plans. In fact, as long as I'm reasonably fit I don't care about fitting into a size 2. As of now, I'm fitter and living healthier than I was two months ago and know for a fact that some of the people in my life that are smaller than me aren't near as healthy as me. That's the value of the program for me. I'm now happy for the changes I'm making now and no longer solely waiting for the day I'm ""skinny"" (I am over 200 lbs, that may not happen for awhile anyway). I probably will start a new exercise program after the ""lean for life"" phase of Chalean's program, but I will keep her Motivational CD close by for a very long time.",1263427200,19,4491,4.336504161712248
3725992,5,B001O2MWGI,"A little background about myself, I am 5'3'' and currently 145 lbs, 26 years old. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism recently and that explained the 40 lb gain over the last 4 years. I have been very active most of my life, with the exception of the last 3 years during my struggle through graduate school! In summation, I went from being super fit and exercising 2-3 hours 6 days a week, to only walking my dog for an hour a day. I purchased P90X and have done 2 rounds, but I did not follow the nutrition plan, thus I got stronger but only lost 10 lbs. I have now purchased Chalean Extreme and I am very pleased. I am still a beginner for all intensive purposes, in fact I used Wii Fitness Test and the program placed my fitness level at 3 stars, thus novice to moderate fitness level. Chalean Extreme is perfect for me. It's perfect pace and she really explains the proper form for each exercise and gives a reference point in terms of the amount of weight to use. I would highly recommend it, this program is doable and one can feel that with time you'd have perfect technique.

P90X is excellent, and I can't wait to be fit enough to use it and get excellent results, but the truth is, I am not ready for the program, although I can keep up. I went from doing 0 pull-ups to doing 2 without a chair, so for someone still overweight, I am very pleased. Chalean on the other hand is no too long, thus one can fit into a tight schedule, and see results. I would still add 30 minutes of walking on a TreadClimber to see better results.",1262217600,13,1536,4.242320819112628
3725993,5,B001O2MWGI,"I have to say, as an experienced exerciser who has fallen off the wagon more times than I care to mention, ChaLean Extreme was my ticket back.  I was a Firm junkie up until the moment I found Turbo Jam.  The Firm did not hold my interest enough to keep me working out consistently.

On February 19th of 2009, in a size 16, and tipping the scale at 183 pounds (I'm 5'1"" mind you) I started Turbo Jam.  On March 22nd, 20 pounds lighter already from Turbo Jamming, I started ChaLean Extreme ALONG with Turbo Jam.  The reviewers before are correct in stating that you MUST add cardio.  That being said... the challenge of this program is up to you!  How heavy can you go?  I am certainly not a beginner, and the unique twist on some of the workouts was refreshing actually.  Oh, and unlike the Firm... I didn't need some gadget to do it.  ChaLean Extreme isn't about tons of reps, it is about hitting failure with less reps.  You move at a slow pace so it is your muscles that are lifting the weights in a controlled manner.  No swinging the weights at a fast pace, or dance steps along with lifting.  Focused lifting, in 3 phases.  My strength increased each and every month, and I logged it daily.  For example, I started bicep curls in the Burn Phase (month 1) at 10 pounds.  By the end of the Lean Phase (month 3) I was curling 20 pounds.  That isn't anything to sneeze at.  I learned how to zero in on the muscle group I was targeting, and to make the exercise challenging... harder actually.  Oh, and push ups?  Forget it.  Month 1 I was on my knees... Month 3... all on the toes baby!  I noticed some reviewers are concerned about the music... that isn't important to me, at least not in ChaLean Extreme.  Turbo Jam is a different story!  The music in ChaLean Extreme is there... what it is I couldn't tell you because I never noticed it.  I do know that the crew on the set of ChaLean Extreme are ALL users of the product... all REAL exercisers.  No models.  I talk with them on Facebook, and Twitter, and have even taken a class from one of the crew... Chalene's sister Jenelle.  Nothing fake about it... and they are in great shape!

I have my pictures posted on my profile on the Team Beachbody website to prove the results.  (reneekicksfat is my profile name there) I am now 52 pounds lighter, and in a size 4.  I am ripped, and I continue to use ChaLean Extreme, as well as Turbo Jam.

Will you get results?  It depends on your body, and how you incorporate the program to suit your needs.  Is it challenging?  Do you want it to be?  Go heavy or go home as Chalene says.  I did.  I challenged myself every step of the way.  You can too.

I hope this helps, because I was exhausted, and bored trying to find the workouts that moved me.  Chalene Johnson was my ticket out of my rut.  Good luck!",1261958400,266,2801,4.257142857142857

Chalean Extreme is just awesome. Chalene is great anyway (love Turbo Jam) but this program is just unbelievable. Chalene is as real as it gets and I have seen results after just one week ... and I am not done yet :-)

I need a serious workout program since I need to lose a lot of lbs and this is a great way (lost 29 already, so Chalene's stuff works... and yes, diet is part of this program!)

The fat is melting, I have fun and everything is explained in an easy-to-understand way. It will help you to avoid a plateau in your weight-loss which could happen easily since your body is constantly adapting to your workout and eating habits. And the weights will boost your metabolism (Xmas was my rest day - so no workout - I had too much for lunch and a great christmas dinner and I still lost weight that day!).

Resistance training will not bulk you up, as Chalene keeps demonstrating, the muscles will cause your body to actually get tighter and ""smaller"" since muscle burns fat (get used to this phrase :-)

At week 9, I am going back to more aerobics, less weight training. This program is not for me. Especially since this is the first time I consistently worked out 5 days a week for 9 weeks with not a lot of progress.

3726000,1,B001O2MWGI,"I bought this product after reading many reviews and buying the SelectTech weights for it.  However, on the first dvd, Chalean mentions keeping track of your progress in your guidebook.  Huh?  Where was I supposed to write that down?  There was no guidebook in the version I received.  Instead, I received to small pamphlets, one claiming to be the ""guidebook,"" but with no space to track my progress, and another very thin ""food guide.""

After doing some more internet research I realized that the complete Beachbody version of this product included two much larger, bound, actual BOOKS - the guidebook in question along with a complete recipe book.  In addition to including a guide to track your progress, the guidebook also includes a schedule of workouts, which is absolutely vital to even knowing how to use the program.

I returned this product to Amazon for a full refund and purchased directly from Beachbody.  The full upfront payment ended up costing LESS than my Amazon purchase - and of course the product included all of its necessary bells and whistles.

3726007,2,B001O2MWGI,"Okay, I'll admit that I reeeeeaaaaaaaaaaalllllllly wanted to like this product. Truly, I'm a huge fan of Turbo Jam and for what it is worth, I'm glad that I invested in this program simply 'cause it gave me an excuse to invest in some powerblocks. =) I'm currently at the tail end of the lean phase, with just a handful of workouts left (yes, I'm going to finish it, thinking about just doing the rest of my scheduled workouts in one clean swoop so I can move on to a new program with no guilt, lol). So, here's my overall impression, both good and bad.

The Bad: To offer a little background, I was trying to use this program to kick start a little weight loss. I've always been active and fairly thin (5'8'', around 110-120 pounds)... pending further explanation, it's been a rough six months and I suddenly found myself 25 pounds heavier! Not such a huge deal, normally I would do exactly what I'm doing now- kick up the cardio and lift heavy for awhile. However, my experience with Chalean Extreme is that there is such an emphasis on weights that I wasn't getting the cardio that my particular body needs, plus I found that my muscle definition is surprisingly sparse, despite the fact that I'm lifting much heavier than usual (I usually favor blended workouts, cardio w/ 8-12 pounds. By the second week of each phase, I was lifting as heavy as or even heavier than Chalean). So, who knows? Yet again, not a biggie, but I didn't meet my goals and feel like I wasted almost three months (with spring in full gear and a ring around my tummy, sigh). Oh, almost forgot- for those of you who would inquire as to what my diet consists of (as you should), I haven't really changed a thing- 1200-1400 calories a day, veggie girl, super health nut lady (we'll leave it at that, lol). Anywho, on to the rant-

Even though I would agree that the workouts are intense, I just don't feel like I'm doing enough! As a whole, I would argue that this program lacks appropriate cardio and (without a doubt) ab work. As of now, even with adding two more hours of cardio and tons of ab work, I've lost only eight pounds, my pants aren't any looser, and my thighs have definitely gotten bulkier... not exactly the results I was looking for. As a last addition to my rant- the program is just plain boring. Weight lifting can be for many, but I love it if I have the right music... this just didn't do it for me.

The good: Chalean isn't wrong, muscle does burn fat. Although I didn't really care for this program, mostly due to lack of results (it's true that what works for one may not work for another. I still benefited from this program, just not at the pace that I'm accustomed to) and repetitive workouts that were boring the first time I did them (but, in defense of the program, I do bore quite easily. Only thing that keeps me coming back is heavy cardio and loud music... then weights, as something to rid myself of the adrenaline high!).

Honestly, if I had to pinpoint those who may benefit the most from Chalean Extreme, I would say those who are new to weights, surprisingly. I started off with programs like the ones the folks from The Firm puts out... I was in great shape, but it took me years to develop the strength and definition that I desired. So, if you're looking at long-term fitness, building up a strong base with something like Chalean Extreme may be a stellar idea. However, I wouldn't put too much stock into the claims of heavy weight lost. So, put in your three months, build a strong body, and then hit the cardio hard-core. Yet again, pretty much what I do- this program was just a little slow paced for me.

Hope this helps, I sincerely tried to offer an unbiased review.",1239321600,208,3690,4.420588235294118

Some days I am so sore but its a good sore. I never realized I could lift such heavy weights. I am hoping by the time I get thru the Lean phase I can drop 5 or so pounds to expose the newly formed muscles I can feel developing.

3726010,5,B001O2MWGI,"I purchased this program in December 2008 as my Christmas present to myself and it was one of the best gifts I could have given myself.  This program is broken down into 3 segments, you have burn, push, and lean.  Each segment you do for 30 days then go to the next circuit.  Of each phase there is 3 weight lifting workouts that you do that focus on different muscle groups and you work till you reach failure.  For the Burn and lean phase this is 10-12 reps for the push phase failure is reached in the 6-8 rep range.  You will need a variety of weights for this program because your strenght will increase and you will see results quickly.  I have 5# to 35# set and use all my weights now.  Chalene recommends buying the select tech weights and for the price they are well worth the investment for this program.  You will see your body fat melt away with this program and replaced with lean muscle mass.  The more muscle you have the more fat you burn at rest during your day.  The burn phase gets you started with proper form and the moves used to work you entire body.  Push phase is where you go as heavy as you can and you can lift a lot more then you think.  This was my favorite phase, very empowering.  The lean phase is where you do combo moves and start to really see the body lean out and muscle take the place of fat.  I am in the lean for life phase which is the 4th month of the series and you use all your workouts in a different combination each week.  The cardio that comes with the basic set is called Fat burn intervals and burn it off for a reason.  She also includes a yoga type stretch that will give your body a much needed break after the week of work you have ahead of you.  There are two ab workouts that come with the basic package, extreme abs is my favorite and another ab workout.  If you buy the additional dvd sold seperate you get Fat burn challenge, Get lean Intervals and I've got abs.  This allows you to have some variety on the cardio days.  This is not like turbo jam, I think it's better.  You get a great trainer that is encouraging and very positive, which helps motivate you to keep pressing play and doing the workouts.

8328865,5,B001O2MWGI,"I love the exercise! After using Shaun T's stuff for about 2 years, this was a nice change of pace. I was very frustrated however that my DVD's barely play. Several of them skip the entire way through-including: Recharge and Burn 3. Very disappointing, as I live in a developing country and had these hand carried to me. I loved this workout years ago, and with the dial-a-weights it's great for toning and building lean muscle. It was pretty heartbreaking to be counting on a change of pace only for half the DVD's to not work.",1507939200,,528,4.510416666666667

8328867,5,B001O2MWGI,"I'm not new to weight training workouts - I spent years doing them and then switched to triathlon training.  I was spending so much time with the required endurance cardio training, I didn't have time for weight work.  After taking a break from triathlon, I started back up with Beachbody and PiYo.  I loved that and it was a great reintroduction to body sculpting.  Once that was finished, I started with ChaLEAN Extreme.  I'm very happy with how I'm getting as good results from 30-40 minutes of weight training as I was from the 60 minute ones I used to do 5 years ago.  And I have a better physique than I did while triathlon training.

The Burn and Push circuit months weren't too bad and I was looking forward to the Lean circuit - thinking it would be easier.  Well.... it's NOT!  It's actually pretty challenging. This program is very effective if you do it as intended and you adopt a clean, lean diet.  Get rid of your sugar and bad carbs.  The only complaints I have about this are 1) Chalean wears some pretty dumb stuff in some of the workouts (though she admits it when she has the stupid weight lifting boots on; 2) Skip is a nerd; 3) fake smiles by the ""cast"" make me nuts; 4) my balancing skills are the pits, so the Lean Circuit is tough for me.  Combining upper body lifting with lower body balance-on-one-foot exercises takes away from my ability to get the full effect of the exercise.  But I keep trying.",1507680000,,1426,4.417624521072797

I love Chalean Extreme and it will be a workout that I will keep with me for the rest of my life!!! I think it's a great workout program for those who are overweight ( I started at 204 with 33.2 % body fat ugh!!!) and those trying to get toned and have muscle definition. For women: THIS WILL NOT MAKE U BULKY but instead will help burn the fat away to chisel you into a greek goddess ;) While this program seems aimed at women, men can also benefit from it too, like any program you get what you put into it. so go for it men! they always have one male in the cast and they are working hard and lifting weights right there too. You can get your greek God body!

BURN PHASE COMPLETED 10/0/17
1 month down and here is what I have noticed so far
1. You will be sore all over!! This is normal and should pass as you get stronger
2. Downloading the workout schedule and workout sheet. This helps track your progress and I was able to go from lifting 5 to 7 1/2 pounds (using select tech weights to normally 10/12.5 and even up to using 15 pounds during 2 leg exercises in burn circuit 3!! Pretty impressive for 4 weeks =)
3. The key is to go slow with the reps..this will create more burn and tearing down and building of muscle. I remember 4 weeks ago moving WAY to fast and not take the time to complete each rep as slows as I Should. Now I got a 4 down and 4 up count and wow BURN!!!
4. Buy some knee protection sleeves here on Amazon and focus on your form. Chalean is always reminding you to look down and make sure your not going over your knee which will cause knee injury or pain. Always make sure to place your back leg and foot far enough away that your front knee is not going over your foot!! If you're like me you have weak knees and this is a workout that uses compound moves ie. 2 moves at once, and most of the time in the BURN PHASE you will be doing a squat or split movement along with arm workout. I believe in the Push phase, which I am starting in 2 days, you only do one move at a time.

Burn Phase: My arms and back have shown the most visual progress along with my saddlebags and lower stomach. I have muscles showing now that were not there 4 weeks ago!! I went from 42 inch stomach to a 40.25 so reduction of almsy 2 inch in 1 mo th wow!! My clothing fits better and I even went from a Gap Women's 33 to a GAP women 32 pant size (inches matter!)! My stomach and legs are smoother but of course they will take 90+ days to show true results. My weight is only down 3 pounds but my body fat % and BMI % have gone down so I am happy!!!

I am not counting pounds but looking at inches as for me inches are the most important thing AND muscle can add to your weight  so be careful judging this program based on your weight. Also google results from this program and you will notice other people not seeing a huge weight loss unless they add 1 to 2 more cardio sessions but it depends on your body.

After last day of Burn Phase I can say that I truly feel amazing after 4 weeks of exercise. I have more energy than ever before and I was able to even complete other youtube cardio workouts without feeling burned out like I had before Chalean extreme.  I will update this review once I have completed Push Phase (that should be on Nov. 10th 2017!) Until then PUSH PLAY!!!!",1507420800,,3319,4.0349544072948325

8328870,2,B001O2MWGI,"I do not recommend this program.
I gained weight using this program. I lift as heavy as Chalean said, I was so tired that I could only do 2x days of cardio.

The burn program wasn't bad, I liked that Mike lifted heavy.
I enjoyed the build program, but my body was really sore from lifting weights that heavy & I had trouble doing cardio.
The lean program was terrible. The outfits were awful, Chalene attitude in the program drove me insane. I thought perhaps that I was getting a bit of trainer fatigue by now, but a friend of mine also mentioned that the lean phase was not good.

I am actually a fan of Chalene but am incredibly disappointed in this program. I love (LOVE) Turbofire. This program missed the mark by miles.",1503532800,,725,4.362962962962963
8328871,5,B001O2MWGI,"I bought this as a lightening deal and am so glad I did!  It is one of my favorite workouts.  I own several Beach Body workouts, but this is the only one that I've kept up with week after week carving out time in my schedule to follow the workout calendar and progress through the phases (I've currently completed 1 month of Burn, 1 month of Push, and half a month of Lean).  I can tell that I'm getting stronger since I've had to buy heavier weights to continue to challenge myself.  I love that we move slowly with the weights (prevents injury and forces the muscles to work without the aid of momentum or gravity).  I tend to prefer using weights over the bands, but can take bands with me when I go on travel.  I did start to supplement these workouts by adding some additional ab work (an extra 5 minutes after my ChaLean Extreme workout for the day).  This workout definitely exceeded my expectations.  Usually there's at least 1 workout in a series that I don't like or feel could lead to injury (this is one of the reasons I couldn't stick with the Brazil Butt Lift workout schedule), but that wasn't the case with this series.  Every workout in ChaLean Extreme is amazing and very challenging.  The more familiar you get with the moves, the more you can concentrate on the muscle and work harder.",1501027200,,1305,4.422594142259414
