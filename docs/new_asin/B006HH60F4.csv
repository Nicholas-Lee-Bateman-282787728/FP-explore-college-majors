4990435,1,B006HH60F4,Worst movie I've ever seen. Only good part was oderus. The nudity was also a plus.,1418601600,,82,4.1875
4990436,1,B006HH60F4,"I love Gwar.  I love Oderus Urungus/Dave Brockie (RIP).

BUT THIS MOVIE IS TOTAL SH*T.

Not even B Movie level acting.  More like Z level acting.

If you are thinking about buying this because Dave Brockie is in it, don't.  He has a very small role in it, and then they put him on the cover of the DVD to sell more copies.

Buy Hack Job instead.  Or buy his book Whargoul instead.",1410739200,9,380,4.109589041095891
4990437,5,B006HH60F4,"LOL Why do i love the films of a grown man that calls him self Bill Zebub. I don't know i just know i do, and I don't care that they seem like they were ll made omn a week, i been all, like he made all of his films in 7 days and he is just cutting pointless nudity and mindless ranting about topics that are never made clear and tossing some metal on it and boom, next,. But i love his films, so who cares. Film is a part of entertainment and Bills films for what ever the reason entertain me.",1389830400,4,493,3.796116504854369
4990438,1,B006HH60F4,"A terrible pit of disgust forms in my stomach as I am forced to give this movie a single star. I wish that I could give this movie zero stars, or negative stars. Do not watch this movie, I'm really being serious.

Don't pay for this movie, don't show money when this movie is nearby, in fact, if you see whoever made this movie on the road please demand a small sum of money be given to you simply because you are forced to exist on the same planet as this movie

However, this movie did change my life for the better. After listening to the stupidest human being ever born ramble on about his atheistic beliefs I have realized 2 things. First, that natural selection cannot be accurate because no ""survival of the fittest"" mentality could have created such a worthless, racist, piece of s***. And second, I cannot, in good faith, have the same beliefs as such a moron, and I therefore re-accept Jesus as my personal lord and savior. Thank you for putting me back on my path to salvation.",1369008000,6,988,4.39344262295082
4990439,3,B006HH60F4,"I bought this with Antfarm Dickhole, and I watched Antfarm Dickhole first.

Antfarm Dickhole was terrible.

But, I gave this a try anyway, since I'd bought it.  This movie was much better.  Far more watchable.  Funnier.  And the second feature, Metalheads I think it was called, was also watchable.

There is quite a bit of sacrilege here.  I was surprised that the Jesus who is a total douchebag isn't the Jesus that is the son of God.  Given how much of a dick God is makes it even more surprising.

I enjoyed it.  I plan to show it to people.",1360627200,6,545,4.35
4990440,3,B006HH60F4,This is cool if your a gwar fan but beside that it's just a low budget B movie with some boobs and blood.,1358812800,8,105,3.608695652173913
8498521,3,B006HH60F4,"Okay, outside Dave's appearance as the Devil, the movie is about as good as the title.  I bet they shot this for $500.",1519344000,,118,4.130434782608695

8498525,1,B006HH60F4,the only good 5 mins is when oderus is in.  The rest is crap the voice is low and the music is loud.  Just tits and ass for most of the movie which is very boring.  Not even funny most japanese b movies are way better then this.,1457395200,,228,3.7083333333333335
