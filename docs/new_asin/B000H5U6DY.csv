2627518,5,B000H5U6DY,"This film has been a long time in coming but the wait has been well worth it! Paul Naschy once again dons the familiar personage of the long suffering Count Valdemar Daninsky cursed to turn into a murderous werewolf when the full moon rises ! This is probably one of the best ""classic"" battles between werewolf and vampire !(in the guise of Countess Elizabeth Bathory). This film has been released in several incarnations with titles such as "" The Werewolf VS The Vampire Woman, El Retorno Del Hombre Lobo, The Craving and The Night Of The Werewolf"". It is the best in the Valdemar Daninsky saga and high point in Spanish Horror Cinema. The film has been given the ""royal treatment"" in the fabulous transfer that has been done. It,s really flawless and I,ve never seen this film in a better version. It is uncut and beautifully restored. I would hazard a guess that The Night Of The Werewolf didn,t look this good in it,s original theatrical release !! If you love gothic Horror with iconic characters this film delivers in spades !",1184544000,2,1032,4.644808743169399
2627519,5,B000H5U6DY,"I am a big fan of Paul Naschy and this movie was classic Naschy fun.

Gothic horror with a 1970s style twist.

Not too bloody.

A fun evenings entertainment.

Kudos to Deimos for getting the DVD to the market and at a fair price.",1181260800,13,229,4.136363636363637
2627538,2,B000H5U6DY,"This is about some girls who go to Transylvania to awaken an ancient vampire.  There's also a werewolf about, in fact, he becomes the main character of the film as he falls in love with one of the girls, and eventually battles the head vampire.  It was a fairly interesting story, and great credit must be given for the beautiful visuals on display throughout the film.  This is one of those movies where you could show 100 screenshots to someone and they would think it was an awesome, must-see film.

Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing about the film.  The story is told in a very abrupt fashion that often skips from scene to scene with no transition or explanation.  For instance, we originally meet two girls who are going to Transylvania, but once they get there, there are three.  A bit later, another girl is sacrificed in order to bring the vampire to life.  Where did she come from?  Who are these people?  The whole movie is like that.  It's as if 15 minutes of transition scenes were never filmed.  It's the type of thing you'll have to watch a second time just to figure out what the heck was going on the first time you saw it.  Also, unless Transylvania has a lot of semi-arid deserts that I'm not aware of, this was obviously filmed in Spain.  It also has to be stated that the vampires must have been idiots.  They could have killed the werewolf at any time, but instead they wait until the full moon when he's nearly invincible before attacking him.  The dubbing was rather awful, even allowing for the normally poor quality of dubbing.  I found it impossible to become attached to any of the characters because they came off as people speaking lines - really poorly written lines that were corny in the extreme at times, and not as actual human beings.

As far as the DVD, the picture quality is absurdly good, especially considering the age and obscurity of the film.  I've never seen an older film look so perfect.  The sound quality is another matter.  You get a Spanish 2.0 track, and English 2.0 track, and an English 5.1 track.  On the 5.1 track, it's like they took a mono track and just ran it through all the speakers.  Dialog comes out of all five at once, though it has a much more detailed sound than the English 2.0 track.  As far as the 2.0 track, it sounded okay until a certain exceptionally loud musical passage.  A single note was held for a long time, and I swear it made my whole head vibrate.  I listened to a bit of the Spanish track, the actors didn't come off much better in that language either.  Besides, the whole point of the movie is the fabulous visuals;  If you want to miss out on all that and spend the whole time reading text at the bottom of the screen, well, be my guest.

Overall, this film is an absolute feast for the eyes, it's like a piece of Gothic artwork.  However it's a movie, not a painting, and the storytelling and dialog are simply bad.  I'm afraid I can't give it better than a 2 out of 5.  Maybe it will grow on me a bit more if I watch it again.  I hope so, as it's a gorgeous movie.",1221868800,,3068,4.345070422535211
2627539,5,B000H5U6DY,"Lycanthrope of perpetual sorrow (and gore) Waldemar Daninsky -played as always, by criminally underrated Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy- came back from the dead yet again in 1980 for the 9th out of 12 films starring El Hombre Lobo, the baddest werewolf ever to grace the silver screen.  It really is a shame that Naschy is not well known because his stuff slashes, gouges, and gnaws all over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lon-Chaney-Jr-s-work/dp/B0001CNRNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lon Chaney Jr's work</a>, which I love. This time around, Naschy (born Jacinto Molina) not only starred and wrote, but DIRECTED this - arguably his finest film -known in Spain as ""El Retorno del Hombre Lobo"".  Did you not get enough hot brunette vampires battling our hero in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Werewolf-s-Shadow/dp/B0015RCUKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Werewolf's Shadow</a>?  Well, here you go.

In ""Night of the Werewolf"" real historical vampire Elizabeth Bathory has gained some young sexy friends some centuries after her and her followers -Daninksy among them, though against his will- were executed for all kinds of goat-heavy badness (a cookie for anyone who pegs that reference).  Once a pair of grave robbers remove the silver crucifix from the werewolf's corpse on the full moon (just an all around bad idea, really), the fun begins.  The satanic beauties stay at Daninsky's gothic crib where the main (wolf)man naturally takes the pick of the litter for his own -he's pimp like that- and spends his nights killing hobos by the full moon while Bathory's Angels prepare the ritual for her resurrection.  Hint: there's blood involved.  Before you know it Daninsky is back in the vampire hunting business as the brunette bombshells one-by-one are turned by the Blood Countess and turn on him.  Violent hijinks ensue.

This is arguably a better vamp vs were flick than even ""Shadow"" was.  Bathory proves a worthy foe and I've never seen vampire telekinesis used in cooler ways in a movie begore(uuuuse the fooorce Liz).  On top of all the blood, sex, and nudity (toned down a bit, but it's certainly there) there is a truly outstanding genre film here.  Naschy crafted a handful of shots in this film that are to die for.  A pair of vampires descending on two thieves in a shed filmed at an odd angle appear to be floating in along with a dense mist which makes for a very eerie effect.  There's also a murderously good shot of a vamp succubus and Daninski during a nighttime seduction where you can clearly see the girl stretched out on top of him, but the mirror behind them shows only him on the bed.  Classic, classic stuff.  The climax ends in an annoyingly similiar fashion to ""Shadow"" (what, do werewolves drool garlic or what?), but the battle in ""Night"" is far superior.  There are also little classic horror references such as a gallery of historical portraits some will recognize as Bathory herself along with Vlad Dracul and a third that I couldn't place (possibly Rasputin).  Then there is Daninski's disfigured assistant, Mircalla; an obvious reference to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carmilla/dp/0809510839/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carmilla</a>, whose names must all be anagrams of one another.

Do you love classic horror?  70's-style exploitation?  Vampires?  Werewolves?  What if they were fighting each other?  How about joy?  You like joy, right?  If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions I've got a treat for you: this film.  I assume you're not illiterate and can handle some subtitles, of course. Naschy's werewolf films are must-see material for anybody who fancies themself a fan of Hammer-style old-school horror.  Speaking of Hammer, for further cinematic adventures of Elizabeth Bathory and Carmilla, get this here quality two-fer:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Countess-Dracula-The-Vampire-Lovers/dp/B00009PY48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Countess Dracula / The Vampire Lovers</a>.  It contains an extremely loose fictionalized adaptation of Bathory's true story along with my favorite Hammer film, a nearly spot-on adaptation of ""Carmilla"".  Interestingly, Ingrid Pitt played both roles.  Happy haunting.",1220572800,5,4328,5.766929133858268
2627540,5,B000H5U6DY,"A must have for any horror fan. This is Naschy at his best. You get vampires, zombie, and Naschy himself the werewolf. Great plot, and effects for its time.

2627541,1,B000H5U6DY,"Even for a fan of cinema trash (such as myself) these 2 movies are just so bad (acting, directing, set design, everything, terrible) that it was painful to sit through them. If you feel you MUST, rent first!!",1205971200,3,208,4.5
2627542,4,B000H5U6DY,"Both of the films on this Blu-Ray, I had initially purchased on their DVD release from BCI.  I must say that I like the DVD packaging the best, as the films seem to be presented with a bit more class.  Top notch packaging on the DVD.  The Blu-ray, however, is the way to go with regard to the feature presentation.  While I did have some issues with the menu operations, as they were simply ported over from the DVD and did not always work the same, I had absolutely no problem appreciating the image quality.  The DVDs were amazing.  A lot of love and care was taken in their production.  The Blu-ray doubles the bit-rate and doubles the picture quality.  Like putting on glasses for the first time, moving from the DVD to the Blu-ray was remarkable.  The great DVD image that you were used to, all the sudden seems fuzzy in comparison to the Blu-Ray.  Both films benefited form the Blu-ray upgrade.  While BCI did not go all-out with their Bit-rate transfer, this is definitely a must-purchase for horror fans, particularly those of Paul Naschy.  And the price?  Wow.  Two movies on TWO SEPARATE Blu-ray discs for around $20!  That can NOT be beat.  My only hope is that BCI continues in this way as I have been buying all of their Spanish horror releases to this point, I am now going to wait for the Blu-ray releases as they are worth the wait.  My suggestion to them is to work on the menu operation and maybe increase the bit-rate.  Stellar release however.  Buy it.",1203638400,10,1472,4.466165413533835
2627543,5,B000H5U6DY,"""The Night of the Werewolf"" is truly one of the most frightening movies with impending mystery and terror that dwells within its gothic atmosphere.

Haha wow, so horrible it was awesome.

Highlights include a beheading of a real chicken(they really do go nuts after their head is cut off), a pitch fork fight that doesn't disappoint and some of the best porno music I have ever heard... the score doesn't quite go well with the movie

I have to say, that this film is truly a very decent film and part of the Naschy's classics in the werewolf sagas that he has played. Remember, its not as good as ""Curse of the Devil"" and ""Werewolf Shadow""..but, its right next to them thats for sure, however, it is better than ""Frankenstein's bloody terror"" though thats for sure.

2627546,4,B000H5U6DY,"Night of the Werewolf was written and directed by Naschy himself in 1980, after gothic horror had out gone of style. Unlike Hammer's last movies of the 70's, however, this film is gorgeous. Naschy plays a tormented werewolf under the power of the vampiric Elizabeth Bathory. Certain plot elements, especially the opening scene where a man is executed wearing a mask, seem to be cribbed from Black Sunday.",1185235200,3,404,4.955882352941177

8136619,4,B000H5U6DY,"These are two spanish made horror films of the seventies, they used mono sound on most movies back then so the review about bad sound shouldn't phase you.  BCI unfortunately went out of business so we won't be seeing anymore blu rays from them , they managed to put out a few low budget gems though like this one and 'sister street fighter' and wisely they gave us two movies for the price of one. Something the major studios should do on older titles.  The films have clean prints which is great , I can't stand watching dirty  prints and scratches all over the place when you can clean them up digitally these days. It's  a moot point because BCI is gone and Paul Naschy followed them to the grave last year sadly. He loved making wolfman movies and they are a varied lot with 15 of them or so made by Naschy over his career. I enjoyed them all and have tried to get them on dvd; so I was glad to see this blu ray edition. It's a standard gothic wolfman tale here unlike a few of the others in like the werewolf meets dr jeckyl or  werewolf meets the vampire women,  it's more like 'mark of the wolfman'  ok , so if  you don't like low budget horror movies you don't even need to get these, these are movies from the seventies though and they have nudity etc in them so it's not low budget for preteens either imo. I would love to see tons of low budget horror and such come out on blu ray , even a straight dvd to blu ray type transfer looks better than the standard dvd,although few movies from the past will ever look like a newer one on blu ray ,restoration can make them look great.  these had really good prints so that really helps on this release. the zombies movie is really cool imo , it features the old style zombies ,created from witchcraft and those were fading out in 72 to be replaced by flesh eaters!  However; this like most low budget horror is not going to be on the top lists of most people, however low budget horror is a love of mine so on a low budget horror movie scale I give these flicks a four star rating.  sure they are awkward occasionally but the naschy werewolf movies are alot of pure fun!  Sadly there's not alot of old horror on blu ray yet. It will always look better on blu ray even if it's not restored color wise, these prints were good ones though!  Remember these are spanish horror movies which have bit different flavor from ours perhaps but you do get english soundtrack dubs too.  People who can't enjoy old horror with a bit of camp perhaps should avoid these but for those of us who dig these , I would love to see more blu rays of old foreign horror movies. And these are better than many other foreign flicks of the day due to naschys presence.",1293753600,4,2696,4.219844357976654
8136620,3,B000H5U6DY,"I had never heard of Paul Naschy before.  I did some research and found that many consider him to be a Spanish equivalent of Lon Chaney Jr.  And I must agree with this.  The first film, ""Night of the Werewolf"" is pretty good.  An evil witch wanted a werewolf under her control.  She got the werewolf but missed that ""control"" part.  So now it's an angry werewolf verses an evil witch.  Naschy has played the werewolf character many times before and the role is perfect for him....just like Chaney.  But also just like Chaney, it seems he is not so good in other roles.  The second film, ""Vengeance of the Zombies"" is pretty bad.  This really isn't Nascy's fault.  The script is rather poor and the girls who play the zombies are simply terrible.  I give the first film 3 stars and the second film 2 stars.  I hope we see some more of his werewolf films.  By the way, both films have some scenes with some nudity and would probably get an R rating because of it.  This is not obvious looking at the cover or description. It doesn't bother me, but some folks might like a warning before showing these films to the kids.",1262822400,3,1117,4.354368932038835
8136621,4,B000H5U6DY,"This movie is in Spanish and I had to press the language button on the dvd player to get it to play in english. After I pop it out of the dvd player and play it again it is back in Spanish and I have to press the language button on the dvd player again.

This film had been brightened up so you can see the settings better but the darkness on the VHS version of this filmed added to the eerieness. I always liked the music in this film. When a vampire attacks a women walking in a long hallway and the woman stabs the vampire it has this eerie singing like nuns in the cathedral on LSD singing latin (or maybe Spanish) but it has a medieval sound to it.

This has been one of my favorite horror films. I thought it was made in the 1970s but it was made in 1980.",1234742400,,761,3.903225806451613

8136623,3,B000H5U6DY,"Considering what I had heard about this film, I found it to be a bit of a letdown. It's a decent horror film, but the whole look of the movie had a ""made for TV"" feel to it. I can't explain it. It's not cheap looking, it just had a flat look to it. To make an analogy, this film is to Molina's Werewolf movies what Scars of Dracula was to Hammer's Dracula films. A slightly better than average addition to a series of films that were starting to wear out their welcome.",1224979200,2,469,4.053763440860215
8136624,4,B000H5U6DY,"NIGHT OF THE WEREWOLF (El Retorno del Hombre Lobo) is a part of director Paul Naschy's series about the lycanthropic shape-changing Lord Waldemar Daninsky. The 70's ""Werewolf Shadow"", this Euro-horror franchise came 10 years before ""An American Werewolf in London"". Now unlike, some other werewolf films that also came out in the early-mid 80's, Naschy's approach is more about traditional, old-fashioned gothic horror with the added elements of a romantic tragedy.

In the 16th century, Countess Bathory (Julia Saly) is sentenced to a slow death by being imprisoned in a stone tablet due to her machinations with the devil. Her lycanthropic aide, Waldemar is more than willing to die and end his enslavement to the wicked Countess. After many centuries, Waldemar's corpse was found by a pair of grave robbers and they took the silver cross that kept his body in place; thereby awakening the werewolf.
Days after, three beauteous aspiring archaeologists led by Erika (Silvia Aguilar) crosses paths with a revived Waldemar and they accept his hospitality in his castle. Karen (beauteous Azucena Hernandez) instantly falls in love with Waldemar; apparently she is the chosen one who will end the Count's curse. Erika herself is a student of the dark arts and she intends to revive the vampiress; Countess Bathory, with the blood of her friend Barbara (Pilar Alcon). Bathory awakens after many centuries and is determined to once again put Waldemar under their enthrallment in order to fulfill the prophecies of darkness on Earth.

""Night of the Werewolf"" is undoubtedly very much linked with other films of the series. I have not seen ""Werewolf Shadow"", (or did I?) so I can only assume that this entry would be a ""souped-up"" version of the ones that came before. Despite this film's title, it definitely plays more like a vampire film than a werewolf film; the film is slower-paced with a developing storyline and has a very restrained amount of blood and violence. Indeed, the film does appear to be very sexy and seductive in its own way, much like a vampire film. There is a fair amount of nudity and sex but very mild in today's standards. The film is definitely a gothic horror film; although its timeline can be easily placed in a modern era, with the presence of a pool party in the beginning where women prance around in bikinis, the appearance of a car--but besides all those elements, if you take those scenes out, most of the film's costumes and the backdrop (in an ancient castle) has that very ""gothic"" feel to it.

The film's special effects utilize the old fashioned style of camera fade-outs and traditional animation of photos that were further developed in the 80's. You see Naschy is in half-man, half-wolf form with his shirt still in place. The Lycan look is more reminiscent of the old-school ""Wolfman"" rather than the lycans in the ""Howling"". Waldemar may be a lycan but he is a gentleman, and gentlemen always keeps their shirts on.  The female vampires are quite breathtaking; they are quite beautiful and seductive, and follows the look of earlier vampire features. Their fangs look as if they've been done by a professional orthodontist much to the film's credit. The film also comes with the usual ""foggy"" special effects that emulate a spooky atmosphere, that is further enforced by the torch-lit castle, and cobwebbed crypts.

While ""Night of the Werewolf"" is a nostalgic return to old-fashioned traditional romantic horror films that can be compared to the Hammer monster films in the 60's, the film does have its faults. There are a few plot holes and some scenes seem to jump around in sequence. The love between Waldemar and Karen seemed severely underdeveloped; chosen or manufactured by destiny, one would be hard-pressed to believe that Karen would just fall in love with him after being unconscious. But hey, what do I know about the supernatural power of Love? One minute, Erika and Barbara were about to go to bed (excuse to show nudity) then they are in the Countess' tomb. These little things may hamper the film's pace to the experienced watcher. The screenplay does have its share of carelessness but some scenes still would hold out well even by today's standards. (a naked, lifeless body hung upside-down while it drips blood to revive Bathory and blood poured onto Mircalla are classic scenes)

Still, ""NIGHT OF THE WEREWOLF"" is a refreshing watch and a welcome homage to traditional gothic romantic horror/tragedies. The film may be slower-paced than what we are used to and those looking for an abundance of blood and violence may be a little let down. The battle between a werewolf and a vampire always holds a certain charisma, especially to the avid horror fan. When viewing this film, keep in mind that it was made more than 25 years ago and enjoy it for what it is. The film may have its shortcomings in the technical side and definite flaws in its storytelling that makes it feel rather dated, but it may also be seen as part of the film's main draw. The film is a definite TRUE homage to classic horror/monster features.

RECOMMENDED! [3  + Stars]
Please view the film in its original Castillian language and use the English Subtitles, it is much better than utilizing the English dubbed track.
Special thanks to amazon friend Trashcanman who pointed out this film to me.",1222473600,15,5326,4.8903654485049834
