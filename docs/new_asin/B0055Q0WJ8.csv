8458580,5,B0055Q0WJ8,"""Black Bread"" is a movie that will keep you both at the edge of your seat and making up your own conclusions as you are watching.

In the spotlight of the movie, Andreu, a child with an immense love for both his dad and mom, goes through a series of changes as reality hits him and the viewer.

Along with Andreu, Pitorliua, the ghost of a local legend, is also in the spotlight of the film. As the movie progresses, you see how the legend of Pitorliua is dragging along with him Andreu's family into a series of dramatic events that keeps you, like Andreu, fabricating and dismissing hypothesis trying to figure out what is really going on.

The film has several subplots going on where you are witness of the destiny of women during General Franco's regime, the questionable ideals taught at school by a also questionable local teacher, and the way homosexuality is seen at the time.

""Black Bread"" is a film filled with unexpected twists that left me wanting for some more dramas like this at the end of it.",1356566400,3,1010,4.502732240437158
8458581,4,B0055Q0WJ8,"Set in the 1940s, just after the Spanish Civil War ended, ""Black Bread"" follows the story of a young boy Andreu (Francesc Colomer, outstanding), whose friend Culet is murdered, together with his father Dionis. Just before he dies, Culet whispers a strange word to Andreu: something that refers to the monster that, some villagers believe, lives in a cave.

Though ""Black Bread,"" based on a novel by Emili Teixidor, is partly a whodunit, Agust Villaronga's film is more aptly described as a coming-of-age story of an 11-year-old boy Andreu, who slowly realizes that the world he lives in is full of lies and dark secrets: secrets that these adults including his parents - father Farriol (Roger Casamajor), who was involved in a political movement, and mother Florncia (Nora Navas), whom the town's powerful mayor (Sergi Lpez) once loved - try to ignore.

The melodramatic story unfolds against the backdrop of a post-Civil War Catalan community, showing the conflicts between the people with metaphors like the titular ""black (and white) bread."" The fast-paced narrative is sometimes confusing with too many characters and back stories to follow, but thanks to the superb acting from Francesc Colomer as the protagonist, ""Black Bread"" remains gripping throughout.

""Black Bread"" is an official selection for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards (2011), though the film was not nominated. The film is also notable for being shot in Catalan language.",1342569600,2,1468,5.185654008438819
