2207912,4,B0007A5LP2,"I am very happy to see this series on dvd. I remember watching this when I was about 9 or 10 years old in the 60's. Walter Brennan, Dack Rambo and Jason Evers are sublime as the 3 principal characters in this very interesting western series. The photography, music and great scripts/acting will hook you. Although the transfers are not the most pristine one could hope for, this may be as close as fans will get to having a preserved copy of these great episodes. The fact that this series is relatively obscure as compared to say Gunsmoke or Maverick, makes this understandable. With regards to these shows being the syndicated versions( some stuff missing), this is probably correct, but again the fan/viewer should be happy that the show is available at ALL on dvd. I don't think it was ever made available on VHS. The picture/sound though are very good considering that they were transferred from 40 year old materials. In summary, this is a very enjoyable 4 star package of yesteryear entertainment that beats the current crop of "" reality shows"" by light years. Enjoy!",1106179200,33,1074,4.748663101604278
2207913,4,B0007A5LP2,It is wonderful to have this under-rated western tv series available from the 60's. The episodes were produced well on dvd and the picture and audio is quite good--it is even recorded in dolby digital! There are bonus features as well including a great biography of Walter Brennan and a special guest star bonus feature. Also included is  an old 50's episode of a series Brennan appeared in as well. The reason I rate it at 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has the edited syndicated shows. Is there no way to release these great shows uncut?,1104969600,29,540,4.454545454545454

2207917,4,B0007A5LP2,"Taking into consideration the years that this series ran and how it was filmed it was fairly passable  Although it was not one of my favorite series, it did have good story lines. Walter Brennan is an unmistakable  classic.  The technical quality of Season One was nothing to write home about.  Color was washed out, the pix was soft, rather sharp and clear; almost assuredly not remastered.  The audio was fine. It is important to consider, when purchasing vintage movies or tv series why you are interested in purchasing it; the players, the story lines, the genre, nostalgia, etc. Is remastering important? Are simple transfers acceptable for your needs or desires? Vintage  series that are reproduced for the mass market by both large and small companies (e.g. CBS Home Video, Paramount, Timeless, Shout, etc.) often differ in quality, not only by between companies, but often within the same company; some companies are more greedy than others. The bottom line usually is  $$$$, so the choice to purchase and the price to purchase it at is in the hands of the consumer.",1414368000,,1074,4.900552486187845

2207929,5,B0007A5LP2,If the only TV you've seen is the junk that has been produced in the last 20-30 years then this show might hurt your little brain. Good stories with great characters and great actors are told in 30 minutes (acutally less without the commercials). The #1 goal of today's Hollywood is to promote sexual perversion. This show does not do that.,1371859200,,340,4.590163934426229
2207930,5,B0007A5LP2,There are only 2 seasons of this family-values Western and we had loaned our 1st season out never again to see it.

2207932,5,B0007A5LP2,I truly enjoy the TV westerns of my youth.  This series was great.  The video quality was as good as could be expected for the era.,1361232000,,131,4.0
2207933,5,B0007A5LP2,"Our family enjoys the old Westerns that my husband and I grew up on, but somehow we missed this one. What was our delight to find that we really LIKED this, in spite of its being only a half hour show. With Walter Brennan, a magnificent actor, as the grandfather, Will Sonnett, and Dack Rambo as the grandson, we found it usually well written and very well acted. The relationship between Will and his grandson, Jeff, is refreshing. The old man shows love, affection, sometimes anxiety, and a growing respect for the younger. We've come to expect young men to be rude and contemptuous of their elders, so Jeff's respect, courtesy, and trust in his grandfather is extremely refreshing. We also appreciated Will's prayer at the end of the show. It added a thoughtful (in the sense of someone actually thinking) touch to the show, a recognition of the weaknesses of mankind, and a reverence for God. In some cases this might seem corny, but with Walter Brennan's performance it seemed the real McCoy!
  We were disappointed to find that this contained only one disk, but before we have finished the complete disk, my husband has asked for the next season. Also the color seems a little faded but we appreciate being able to see this jewel of a show.",1361145600,,1246,4.659090909090909

Tagged at the end of the Amazon title listing for this item are the words ""Disk One"". You'll have to open the case to realise that disk one contains only NINE episodes,roughly one third of a season. How do I get the other two thirds?

I guess buy the more expensive version.",1263859200,6,404,4.246753246753247

GRODIN, NICHOLSON, HOPPER and many more guest stars and character actors from a great era. I can't give the dvd 5 stars because the audio and video could be better but the show is REALLY good! I am buying the 2009 release of season 2 and if the picture and sound has been improved then I will get the 2009 release of season 1- the show is THAT good!!! Try it, you'll love it.

The moral aspect of the movie as a whole was better than the downside of the occasional drinking of alcohol by Will and Jeff. Each episode is the same but different.  Still looking for Jim Sonnett, but new encounters in very town. Walter Brennen is a legend! This series is definitely one of our favorites!",1240272000,,466,4.511904761904762

2207943,4,B0007A5LP2,"This is a great series, well written and with great actors. It's as much fun spotting the then unknown future stars among the extras as it is watching the episodes themselves. My only objection is the brevith of the indivigual episodes. Apparently a good bit of the stock was lost over the years, because none of the episodes seem to last more than 15v to 18 minutes.",1217462400,,367,4.492537313432836
2207944,4,B0007A5LP2,"This is a great Western TV show that I enjoyed watching as a child.  The acting and story lines are great.  I agree with all the other superlatives you can read in the other reviews.

However, these are not the original full length shows; they are edited versions used for syndication.  I estimate that there are about 4 to 5 minutes cut out of each episode of this 1/2 hour show.  The editing is often terribly done too - it is usually very obvious where the cuts were made.  In addition, when you look at the ending credits you will often find a character listed (i.e. ""Clerk"", ""Bartender"", etc.) that you realize you never saw in the episode you just watched.  Then you realize that was a character from a scene that was cut out.

I've watched most of the first disk and some of the episodes on disks 2 & 3.  Once of the episodes on the first disk was edited so badly that the plot line is incomprehensible.  In this episode a cattleman driving a herd of cattle intends to kill the local town's sheriff and tear up the town.  We never learn why he is so mad at the sheriff or town and thus the motivations of the characters and overall plot are total mysteries.

But the disks are worth it anyway as this is too good of a show to miss.  Each disk has a very nice special feature included on it.",1216339200,5,1297,4.223577235772358
2207945,5,B0007A5LP2,They don't make good shows like this any more.  It's a shame.  Love the old Westerns!  This is good show.  It has quite a few now famous actors just making the Hollywood scene.,1211760000,,176,4.242424242424242
2207946,5,B0007A5LP2,I love it!!!  They don't make them like this anymore. This one is now part of my PERMANENT collection.,1210809600,,102,4.368421052631579
2207947,3,B0007A5LP2,"This series has some great lessons and depicts an historical time period.  However, most of the episodes suffer from too much editing.  They appear to have original commercials edited out as well as some period of regular episode footage.  Almost all episodes have some part of the plot missing.  Will and Jeff talk about their conversation or some part of the episode that is not there in the edited version on these discs.  Overall good stories, but you sometimes have to deduce the missing parts to make sense of the remaining story.  I would buy this series again only if the entire episodes were present.",1207785600,8,609,4.752380952380952
2207948,4,B0007A5LP2,"This series took me back to weekends in my early years waiting for this show to come onto TV for the afternoon.  Definitely nostalgia involved in the enjoyment but even for that, the series tends to still stand up to a watchable event.  Probably more aware on the limited background shots and simple style of preaching style of dialogue, but it has been fascinating to watch the actors who appeared as guest artists in the series.  If you liked the serial western series, well worth watching otherwise may not your thing!!",1193443200,3,522,4.714285714285714

2207950,5,B0007A5LP2,"My family used to watch these episodes of Guns of Will Sonnett when they were on tv many years ago.  We like the way they begin, and the prayer that is said at the ending of each episode.  When my husband mentioned he would enjoy seeing those episodes again, I got on the internet and ordered the first season for him.  He loved the gift!  Our son, and the two of us, watch two episodes at a time, almost every night.  We finished the first Season, and I ordered the second season for him, and we have started watching those episodes also.  It is good, clean, tv watching, and there is a lesson to be learned in every episode....I rate these films with 5 Stars.  They have become a treasured part of our DVD library.",1168300800,10,716,4.2592592592592595
2207951,5,B0007A5LP2,"I remember this series from my childhood, and memories of certain scenes and pieces of dialogue have stuck with me into my late middle-age. What I remember best is the feel the series had - a kind of romantic earnestness - and a majestic and epic tone. I had nearly forgotten the series myself, except for these bits of memory, when one day browsing Amazon, I saw the DVD set offered. Suddenly, almost reflexively, I gave it the Amazon ""one-click."" Call it a childish impulse.

I began watching the first season with trepidation. I had watched this show originally when I was 11 or 12 years old. Things remembered from childhood so often disappoint in the glaring, cynical light of adulthood. Not this time. The series lived up to my memories and, in fact, was better than I had remembered it. The romance of the tone was still valid, which had captured me as a child, but now I could really appreciate the craft and care with which the series was made.

The series had a brilliant concept, biblical in its proportions: a grandfather (Walter Brennan) and grandson (Dack Rambo) go roaming the West in the late nineteenth century, searching for the young man's father, a famous gunfighter missing from the family for twenty years. One needs to find his prodigal son, the other needs to find a father he has never known. Both are skilled gunfighters themselves, both having been trained by the grandfather. As the grandfather puts it when questioned about the skill of his notorious son ""He showed promise.""

The acting is excellent throughout, most notably Walter Brennan as the patriarch, Will Sonnett, who is absolutely convincing in the part - whip-cord tough with more than a streak of mean in him, furiously devoted to his grandson and their shared quest. It is a simple thrill to watch him handle a Colt, as surprising and sudden as watching a snake strike. Dack Rambo is very good as Jeff Sonnett, the third generation of Sonnett gunmen. Rambo really captures the son's ache to find a father he has never met, and his open need is often a bit of a surprise and very moving (one of the strengths of the series is the direct and honest way emotions like love and loneliness are dealt with, always simply without a bit of hokum). Finally, Jason Evers is excellent as the aging, haunted gunfighter, Jim Sonnett, the mention of whose name causes barrooms to become tense and quiet. Evers as Jim Sonnett seems gaunt and ragged, maybe even cursed, until he is called out, at which time he suddenly stands up straight and is filled with unnatural speed. The actor, Jason Evers recently passed away (March of 2005) and he is well remembered with his performances in this series.

The writing is among of the best in television's history, with some of the finest episodes penned by co-creator Richard Carr (the other creator was Arron Spelling). In fact, all aspects that fall under the umbrella of ""production values"" were top-notch. The sets were always authentic and have a ""deep"" look, and the cinematography was always creative and original. (for a really great example of this, check out the episode ""Of Lasting Summers and Jim Sonnett"" which has a shot of a grinning hangman staring straight down through a gallows trapdoor, looking the viewer straight in the eyes).

When Will Sonnett says, ""No brag, just fact"" he will make a believer of you. Thanks heavens this series can be seen again. -Mykal Banta",1124755200,50,3405,4.7449324324324325
2207952,5,B0007A5LP2,"I have watched a lot of westerns.  This series is better than ""Have Gun will travel"" and ""Wanted Dead or Alive"".  It has great acting, action and drama.  This is a very captivating and profound show.",1121558400,11,199,4.472222222222222
2207953,5,B0007A5LP2,"The Guns of Will Sonnett is one of the best ""unknown"" western series ever produced on TV. Walter Brennan (best known from his movie roles and as a regular on TV's ""The Real McCoys"") is an absolute revelation in the lead role of Will Sonnett, the father who, with his grandson, is searching for his son, ""James,"" a gunfighter.

The series only ran from 1967-1969 and was one of the first produced by now TV-mogul Aaron Spelling. Each half-hour episode began with Brennan reciting a western ballad-like narration of the premise:

""We search for a man named Jim Sonnett,
and the legends folks tell may be true;
Most call him gunman and killer,
He's my son who I hardly knew.

I raised Jim's son from the craddle,
'til the day he said to me,
'I have to go find my father,'
And I 'reckonned,
that's how it should be;
So we ride,
Jim's boy and me.""

Will's grandson, Jeff, is portrayed superbly by Dack Rambo, (who died tragically in the 1990's from AIDS.) In the show, Jeff had never met his father, portrayed throughout the series by Jason Evers. Jim Sonnett sent his infant son to live with his father, Will Sonnett, on an Army base where Will had worked as a Scout. A note penned to the baby from Jim told his father that few people have an opportunity for a second chance -- in this instance, to raise a child well.

Will's character is tortured by shortcomings as a father to Jim and blames himself for the ""career"" his only son chose and from leaving home and striking out on his own at a very young age. As a scout, Will was away from home much of the time, especially after his wife was killed by Indians. One day he returned to the fort to find that his young son, Jim, had left never to return.

An episode in this first-season set, ""Alone,"" is a tour-de-force for Brennan who suffers a grazing gunshot wound to the head and imagines his reunion with Jim, and acts out all of the associated guilt he had felt for decades.

The series follows Will and Jeff as they look for the elusive Jim. While Jim is a fast draw, Jeff is faster and Will is the fastest, but neither man look for trouble. Jeff is innocent, while Will is tough as nails but has a heart of gold. Will's catch phrase, ""No brag, just fact,"" became the mantra of the show over it's short run. Will and Jeff have a strong love for each other that is rarely depicted on TV between male family members, especially in westerns.

Along the way, the two encounter many whose lives were touched, some for good but most for bad, by Jim Sonnett or his legend. By the end of each episode, many wrongs have been righted, and a clearer picture of Jim's character emerges -- he's not a killer, but a man of integrity forced to defend his life by a never-ending series of gunslinging challengers.

Jeff must also contend with the stigma of having a notorious father and last name, which helps him grow up but maintain the human values instilled by his grandfather, Will.

It was also the only Western series to end with a western trail poem recited by Brennan summarizing the blessings or challenges the two encountered in the episode.

If you enjoy good stories, great acting and western action and have not seen this series, the DVD releases of the entire run should be must see viewing. If you remember this show, no more needs to be said, it is simply a series that must be purchased. No brag; just fact!!!!",1111449600,87,3365,4.402576489533011
