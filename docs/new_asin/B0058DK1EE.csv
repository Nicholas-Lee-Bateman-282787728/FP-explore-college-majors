8461404,2,B0058DK1EE,"this is ok. i feel she should hv given us the basics first instead she gets str8 into moves. this is my very first time ever with a pole and i purchased this dvd in hopes of learning all pole basics such as: knowing how to hold myself up on the pole...towards the end she does conditioning,thts a lil better in teaching pole climbing etc.. ill gv this dvd 30 days then i will update u all if my skill moved to intermediate or if Im still a beginner. i wnt to do invents spins and everything, i jus need the skill broken down better than this. also she moves very fast only showing each move twice, and then one move she showed the whole dvd skipped, so tht move isn't there...well see...
***1 yr update*** Im gna keep this short, SAVE YOUR MONEY, AND CHECK OUT THE YOUTUBE CHANNELS OR TAKE SOME CLASSES",1363996800,3,802,4.214285714285714
