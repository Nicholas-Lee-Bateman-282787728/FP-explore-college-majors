8447223,1,B004UC23W2,"This best thing about THE PASSING is PAUL GLEASON, the great curmudgeonly character actor best known as Principal Vernon in THE BREAKFAST CLUB.

The bad thing is Mr. Gleason passed away in 2006, which means your ""new movie"" is less than fresh.

The promising ""House on Haunted Hill""-style main plot of three obnoxious rich kids must spent the weekend in creepy old mansion in order to collect an inheritance quickly fizzles down to being just plain obnoxious.

A cast of thoroughly forgettable and irritating characters, shoddy special effects and a meandering script that drags on endlessly make THE PASSING rather like the passing of black stool.  It smells bad, it hurts to get through and it feels like it's never going to end.

8447224,4,B004UC23W2,"The passing is a ghost story with some hot girls running around. The story is good, typical ghost revenge story going on, but with a couple surprises, that I won't reveal. The hot girls are one of the main reasons people should watch this movie. It is a fun watch on the weekend, when you are exploring those old school movies.",1341792000,,327,4.377049180327869
8447225,4,B004UC23W2,"The movie opens up with a young couple running frantically through the woods. Something unseen is watching and chasing them. The girl can't go on. The man shows her a wooden box (apparently stolen) and says they will never have to work again. He opens the box and a force impales him against a tree. The girl is then attacked.

The movie then jumps to the reading of the will of Rebecca, who passes over her children and gives everything to her 3 grandchildren. Since they haven't come visit her they must spend that weekend at her home to get their inheritance and the granddaughter Elizabeth (Tara Carroll) gets the keys to ""the wooden box."" ooooh eeeeh oooooh!

The movie would be boring if the three kids just sat around so the two boys Jack and Ray decide to invite guests and throw a party to Elizabeth's dismay. The party moves out to the pool. Elizabeth espies some shadows moving about then... Bam! The next thing you know Elizabeth is sitting in a daze with undisclosed wounds as they are wheeling out dead bodies. The investigator asks questions. We now know how the film ends, everyone dead except for Elizabeth.

Elizabeth retells the story as the main part of the movie begins...Elizabeth discovers grandma collected various occult items while the guys pair off and go to their rooms with their girl friends including hot blond Colleen Shannon. Shadowy figures dart about out of the corner of the eye and in mirrors. In addition to well done shadows, there are other inexpensive subtleties, such as statues blinking. The movie soundtrack sounds like there are faint screams in the background. I appreciated these small details. The action and suspense build slowly, like it should.

The movie never explains how the Naibert surname has been passed down from one female generation to the next. The investigator mispronounces ""prolific"" and I don't know if that was intentional or a bad script read missed by the director. The ending was disappointing and anti-climatic.
