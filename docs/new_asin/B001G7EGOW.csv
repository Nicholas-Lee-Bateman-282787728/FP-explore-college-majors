This is mostly a product for the die hard Lennon fangirls and fanboys like myself, but I would have enjoyed it more if there wasn't an over abundance of echo.

Still, a worthy purchase for a great price.",1226361600,,395,4.3108108108108105

8304246,4,B001G7EGOW,"Sound and video quality very good - I wish this was available in widescreen.  This was filmed right after the September 11th attacks in New York city, so most of the commentary is related to that, which is now a little out of context.",1434326400,,234,4.318181818181818
8304247,5,B001G7EGOW,"If you were a Beatles fan, and you loved John's music, and you loved John as the artists that performed at this Concert clearly did, you will also love this Concert DVD. At least I did.

As I write this review, I am watching this DVD for the first time, courtesy of Netflix. I am 30 minutes into the concert and I have already ordered it from Amazon. That's all it took for me to know that wanted to own it. If this Concert does not bring a smile to your face and a tear to your eye... well, something is wrong.

There are a few artists that I had never heard perform before this concert. In fact, there were some that I had never even heard of! But all of the performances are so satisfying, the music is so rich, and the singing is so celebratory, it is truly a sincere, heartfelt and wonderful tribute to John and his music.

Do yourself a favor: get this DVD.",1364428800,,863,4.125
8304248,5,B001G7EGOW,"Starting in 2000 there was plans in the works to celebrate the life and words of John Lennon. October 2nd 2001 was the date set to remember John and to also promote the end to gun violence that is so unfortunately all too common in todays society in America. It was set in New York City at Radio City Music Hall. Then slightly less then a month before the concert was to happen came 9/11. The concert would go on but it now had an additional and more important meaning to it. Now it about John and his music and also the city that he loved and who loved him in return and its survival after one of the most if not the most horrific act of violence to ever be committed.

The concert that would take place that night was something the city really needed as it tried to find some kind of normalcy in a place turned upside down with the crashings of the planes into the World Trade Center. No doubt the events of a month ago would prove to be an inspiration to the musical artists and guest stars that appeared that night to help the city pay tribute to its heros and start the process to bring the city back to life after the horrors it had to endure a few short weeks ago.

The concert started with the famous video that John and Yoko made with him at his famous white piano singing ""Imagine"". Then suddenly Yolanda Adams and Billy Preston (forever known as the fifth Beatle) take over to finish singing the song. It would be a rousing, lively version that seemed to help the audience permission to let loose and enjoy themselves and the concert took off from there. Hosted by Kevin Spacey, who did an excellant job, the concert was enjoyable and helped play on the peoples emotions from tears to cheers and everything else inbetween.

All throughout it all was the words and music of John Lennon performed by an A list of performers who were inspired by his music and in turned inspired the audience with that music. Sixteen songs altogether was performed. 10 of them from John's days with The Beatles and 6 from his solo career. The majority of the performers pretty much stuck to playing the songs the way John did and not try to add their own twists to the songs or look to present them in a different light. It almost seemed like they were putting more emphasis on remember John Lennon by how he performed his own songs rather then how creative they could be with his music. While there are no bad performances there certainly some songs that were better then others. The weaker performances I felt were a listless rendition of ""Instant Karma"" by Nelly Furtado and Dave Stewart. It wasn't dull, just had no spark to it. Craig David gave an interesting version of ""Come Together"" that still seemed to be lacking something in its performance.

On the other hand some of the better songs performed that night included Stone Temple Pilots singing ""Revolution"" that was every bit as good as The Beatles version. Alanis Morissette gave one of the best performances of her life with her version of ""Dear Prudence"", one of my all time favorite Lennon songs from his time with The Fab Four. Cyndi Lauper gave a unique take on ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" from Strawberry Fields itself located in Central Park. Special mention also has to be given to Marc Anthony who sang ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" as well. Maybe the most emotional performance tht evening would come from Shelby Lynne who did maybe one of the most personal songs John Lennon ever wrote, ""Mother"". The most surprising performance of the evening was provided by the host himself Kevin Spacey. While I knew he could sing even I couldn't imagine just how excellant a singer he was until I heard him belting out ""Mind Games"" which brought the house down. And then there was Sean Lennon who performed three times during the evening. Along with Rufus Wainwright and Moby they sang ""Across The Universe"". Later in the show Sean and Rufus along with with a third unnamed person gave some brilliant harmonizing on an early Beatles hit ""This Boy"". For a long time I have wondered who that unknown person was. Nowhere on the DVD box or during the concert itself do they list or mention who this mysterious person is. It never made sense to me since his harmonizing with Sean and Rufus helped to make the song sound so great and beautiful. Well I recently found out the mysterious third singer is Robert Schwartzman. He might be best known to some as the lead singer of the group Rooney. Anyway I am glad to reveal who that third person was up there with with Sean and Rufus and give him praise for his contribution with them on the song. The third song Sean Lennon performed that night was ""Julia"" a song John wrote in tribute to his mother. There has to be no doubt that John himself was looking down that evening and smiling with pride to see his youngest son up there on stage.

All in all it was a sturring concert and the video of that concert is a must for anyone who loves music to add to their DVD collection. The quality of the recording of the concert is outstanding. The music sounds crisp and clear and the picture quality makes you feel like you are there in person at Radio City Music Hall watching all these great musicians at work. You couldn't ask for a better tribute to John Lennon or his music.",1350432000,3,5269,4.461618257261411

8304250,5,B001G7EGOW,"I bought it 5 years ago and since that time i enjoy it every time i listen. Best are Lauper, C. David, Rufus Wainwright. All others are good as well. And of course Lennon music and atmosphere of love and friendship in a hall captures  from the very beginning",1314403200,,258,4.26530612244898
8304251,3,B001G7EGOW,"Ok, you're probably smarter than me and have already realized it: This is a DVD, not a CD. Why Amazon chose to distort the cover to a square so it LOOKS like a CD is their secret. They don't do this with other music DVDs. I like the music (some better, some less so, but that's normal) but I was not pleased not to be able to download it on my iPod. I specifically bought conversion software for that purpose and spent hours editing it... don't ask. Just to let you know.",1273795200,,471,4.130434782608695
8304252,5,B001G7EGOW,"Kevin Spacey and the rest of the people involved with this concert have done an amazing job at honoring the legend that truly was taken too soon. These covers were all heart felt and there were a couple of times during the concert that I had tears coming to my eyes. Kevin's cover of ""Mind Games"" was simply outstanding. I got chills listening to it. The only comlaint I had with the show was the cover of Instant Karma. It just didn't sound good at all, and that is a shame since it is such a loved song. This is the best tribute concert I have ever seen. After watching it, I was ready to watch it again! Well worth buying.",1244160000,,625,4.1735537190082646

Kevin Spacy provides the only energy with his note for note rip on Mind Games.
