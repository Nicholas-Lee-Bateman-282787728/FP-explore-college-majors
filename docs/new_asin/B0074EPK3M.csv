8509789,4,B0074EPK3M,"As the other 4-Star reviewer noted this DVD set covers a lot of material that is more appropriate for people with little experience with guns in general and revolvers in particular. I consider it a great training video for those in that category. I have nearly twenty years experience carrying handguns so much of the material contained in this 2 disc set I had been over numerous times before. Even so, I was still able to glean useful information and felt this video did add to my knowledge base. Mr. Smiths teaching style is this sets best asset; it is both personable and engaging, and the best reason to buy this DVD. If you want to learn about using and carrying a revolver and are on the lower end of the knowledge scale this video is a must buy. If you have a higher level of expertise you will have to decide for yourself if its worth the price. For me it was.",1425772800,,869,4.337423312883436
8509790,4,B0074EPK3M,"This is one of the few, if not the only, DVD out there for people interested in learning a bit more about effective use of a revolver as a defensive weapon.  That said, it is geared much more for the beginner than for a somewhat experienced shooter / revolver user.  I did learn from the DVD but it didn't quite have as much range time instruction as I would have liked.  The first disc is all lecture and I think most people familiar with firearms would not find it all that informative.  The second disc is better and does include some practical instruction.  All in all, this is a worth while DVD, but it didn't do too much to advance my current knowledge of using a revolver.",1354233600,2,679,4.31496062992126
