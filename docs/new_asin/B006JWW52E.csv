8499848,4,B006JWW52E,Ernest Thesiger is excellent as the perfectly polite killer in Murder On The Run/They Drive By Night.  I've never seen 13th but want it.  Hopefully these films will get a better release.  Thesiger steals every scene he's in and carries the whole film of Murder On The Run which would be a complete waste of time watching without him in the film.,1484956800,,345,4.532258064516129
8499849,2,B006JWW52E,"Murder On The Run (aka.- They Drive By Night) is freely available to download
on the internet as it is out of copyright. In buying this DVD I was expecting the
quality to be superior to that which is freely downloadable. It isn't. It is the same
quality. In fact, it appears to be exactly the same. As regards the second film,
The 13th Guest, Ernest Thesiger does not appear in, as far as I can tell, which
is a disappointment as I had expected him to be in it. All in all, this DVD was a
disappointment.",1389052800,2,504,4.153061224489796
8499850,4,B006JWW52E,"Murder on the run ,I really liked. A good little British film about a man wrongly accused of murder. Though one criticism might be they give away the real murderer's ID a little too early. 13th Guest b-movie mystery with Ginger Rogers and hidden passages and wisecracking cops and of course one really dumb one. a Chan type movie without Chan.",1387238400,2,343,4.639344262295082
8499851,4,B006JWW52E,Two highly enjoyable black and white thrillers. Both with an excellent feel for their time and place. Watch for the fabulous Ernest Thesiger as a very early serial killer. Plus much interesting location work. Fine cast in both. Welcome addition to my collection,1372896000,2,261,5.093023255813954
