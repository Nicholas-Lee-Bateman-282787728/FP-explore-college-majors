Actually it's a very dramatically film but just because of Madhuri's great performance and the way they screenplay took place, it very interesting. The story something goes like this; Dr. Sushma (Madhuri Dixit) treats a patient who lost his memory because of some accident and has no idea, who he is, what his name, and etc. She decides to name him ""Krishna"" (Aditya Pancholi), and he responds to her treatment and care. Both get friendly, and eventually fall in love and get married. After the marriage, Sushma gets a phone call from a Police Inspector, who warns her that Krishna is really out to kill her, but she disregards this warning. One day, while taking photographs, Krishna slips and falls down, hurting his head. When Sushma attempts to treat him, he regains his memory, and attacks her. Sushma is shocked beyond belief, and is unable to comprehend as to what harm she has done to this young man, who is out to kill her. It's the past by which Krishna Urf Rajiv wants to kill his wife.",1302393600,,1059,4.578947368421052
