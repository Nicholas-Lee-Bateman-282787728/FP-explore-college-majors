8412056,4,B00404P17E,"I got both volumes. I took MET from an osteopath,Dr. Richard MacDonald, in the mid 80s. These DVDs are a great review. They really do make the subject easier to learn by providing excellent visual aids and going thru the tecniques step by step. If you like MET these dvds are a must. The 4 on the floor concept re occiput/C1 Dx  is sweet.",1360108800,2,338,4.28125
8412057,5,B00404P17E,"Tom ockler made it very simple to learn MET. It describes the biomechanics of the pelvis, sacrum and lumbar spine which made it very easy to apply this technique. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to learn manual therapy.",1297814400,3,233,4.7073170731707314
8412058,5,B00404P17E,"TOM OAKLER HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB WITH THIS DVD. TOM TEACHES SO THAT ANY ONE CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND AND PERFORM EACH TECHNIQUE. MUSCLE ENERGY TECHNIQUES ARE EASY ON THE THERAPIST AND SO MUCH LESS PAINFUL FOR THE CLIENT AND YET AS EASY AS THESE MOVES SEEM, THEY REALLY DO WORK! I HAVE FOUND, WITH MY CLIENTS, THAT THE CORRECTION LASTS AS WELL. I WOULD SAY THIS DVD IS WELL WORTH ITS PRICE AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY MASSAGE THERAPIST, PTA OR PT LOOKING TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS GET WELL. I HAVE USED THESE TECHNIQUES WITH GREAT SUCCESS.",1291939200,5,545,4.405940594059406
