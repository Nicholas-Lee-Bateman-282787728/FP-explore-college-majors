5944004,5,B00EU9TSHI,"Outstanding !  The British Film Institute did  a masterful job in restoring and editing Captain John Noel's original video from the early 1920's.  This is a must have for anyone seriously interested in the Heroic Age of Exploration. I first read Wade Davis' extraordinary book, ""Into the Silence"", subtitled The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest.  The video is in close harmony with Davis' book.  Noel did a masterful job under harsh conditions.",1424131200,,459,5.066666666666666

5944006,5,B00EU9TSHI,"In 1924, a team of British explorers headed by Charles Bruce made the third recorded attempt to scale the summit of Mount Everest.  The attempt led to the deaths of two mountaineers, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, at or near the summit.  It remains a matter of conjecture whether Mallory and Irvine had in fact reached the summit of Mount Everest.

The 1924 team included a photographer, Captain John Noel, who made a detailed documentary of the climb as well as purchasing all rights to the film. Noel used a hand-cranked camera which is much more primitive than today's equipment but he captured the stark beauty and coldness of the mountain and the difficulties of the climb.  For many years, Noel's documentary has been unavailable but it has recently been beautifully restored and released as this silent film, ""Epic of Everest"".  I saw the film in a theater in a presentation sponsored by the National Gallery of Art and the American Film Institute in Silver Spring, Maryland.  Stephen Horne, a composer and a leading British accompanist of silent film, beautifully improvised on the piano for the eighty-seven minute duration of the film.

This film is an outstanding historical record of the attempt on Everest. In addition to showing the climb, the film offers excellent rare footage of Tibetan people, villages and monasteries, including scenes of the world's highest village and of the Rongbuk Monastery at the foot of the mountain. A Lama at the monastery had wished the expedition well, but he predicted that the spirits surrounding the mountain would result in the failure of the attempt on the summit.  The film also captures the lengthy trek to the mountain in a caravan of yaks.  The yaks needed to abandoned when the mountain air became too thin for them to breathe.

Mount Everest appears in cold, rocky, forbidden, and snowy grandeur. The film captures the heroism and difficulties of the climb for the mountaineers and the accompanying sherpas. There are scenes of early bad weather which resulted in the deaths of two members of the parties and of the slow, treacherous work in the ascent.  With a high-powered lens, the film offers a glimpse of Mallory and Irvine tantalizingly close to the summit just before they disappeared.  Then, the party waited and searched before realizing that the pair had died. The remaining members of the party constructed a cairn to their memory.

The film includes extensive subtitles commenting upon and explaining the action.  It is in black and white with some tinted scenes.  The quality of the restoration is excellent.

I enjoyed seeing this film in a theater with a live musical accompaniment. It taught me a great deal about Mount Everest, early 20th Century Tibet, and the 1924 expedition.

5944014,5,B00EU9TSHI,"The Epic of Everest is a documentary chronicling the 1924 expedition by George Mallory and Andrew Irvine to reach the peak of Mt. Everest. The expedition is still clouded in mystery. Both climbers died as well as several others who accompanied them. It is not known whether they actually reached the mountains summit. The mountaineers were joined by filmmaking pioneer Captain John Noel who filmed every aspect of the effort, capturing considerable climbing footage as well as images of local wildlife and culture of the Tibetan region, an area seldom seen by foreigners at the time. The movie contains the first images on film of both Everest and Tibet, stimulating worldwide interest in this remote part of the world.

The new restoration features landscapes resembling the terrain of distant planets in science fiction films. Noel obtained some stunning views of the mountain at various times of the day, with sunlight casting atmospheric shadows. Inter titles indicate the various perils that faced the climbers, with the elements a chief obstacle. Of particular interest are the scenes of daily life among the Sherpas, views of the worlds highest village and several monasteries, and footage of the trek to the mountain in a caravan of yaks. Made just two years after Robert J. Flahertys Nanook of the North, The Epic of Everest introduced the public to yet another distant, frigid part of a still largely unexplored planet.

Special features on the Blu-ray edition include an introduction by Noels daughter, Sandra Noel, featurettes about the scoring of the film and its restoration, and a trailer.",1445472000,2,1604,5.14176245210728

8609440,5,B00EU9TSHI,"As a silent film enthusiast and as someone who has taught close to 30 classes on silent movies at the local university, I have seen a LOT of silent movies including a number of silent documentaries but nothing quite like THE EPIC OF EVEREST. I was vaguely aware of the 1924 George Mallory expedition but was unaware that they had taken a movie camera with them and recorded all but the last 2000 feet of the climb (the last part done with an early telephoto lens). I knew that Mallory and his associate Andrew Irvine had perished some 600 feet from the summit and that their bodies had not been recovered (Mallory's was found 75 years later and buried on the mountain). This astonishing documentary while essentially just a documentation of their journey becomes so much more because of the quality and the purity of the images captured by amateur cameraman Captain John Noel. Noel doesn't just record the expedition but enshrines and transforms it by the beauty of the set ups he chose.

The film begins with them setting out and then arriving in a Tibetan village. Although 200 miles away, Mt Everest looms over everything. Noel's camera captures the look and feel of the village and its people. Remember this is almost 100 years ago and much of what he captures has long since slipped into history. The customs and clothing of the villagers of that time have been preserved forever. As they get closer to the mountain,  the natural conditions began to change and we are thrust into an unbelievable landscape of ice and snow. The way the camera catches it you'd think you were on a far away planet. The power and majesty of Everest are all around as it literally becomes a force of nature dooming the expedition. While there is a palpable spirituality to the images, they are enhanced by the title cards which occasionally refer to the mountain as a divine entity (Chomo-Lung-Ma ""Goddess Mother of the World""). Some also reflect the condescending British colonial attitude of the time.

A major contribution to the effectiveness of the film is the haunting new score commissioned by the British Film Institute and composed by Simon Fisher Turner. It is a balanced mixture of ethnic music and minimalist simplicity augmented by authentic sound effects including the actual wind from the mountain itself. When you realize that these men were not decked out in the latest equipment but with only tweeds and thick coats and gloves to protect themselves, you then realize their courage and fortitude and become amazed at what they actually did manage to accomplish.. While there are natural similarities to SOUTH, Ernest Shackelton's ENDURANCE documentary and the Cooper-Schoedsack saga of Persian tribesman, GRASS, those silent films lack the poetry and potency of Captain Noel's images. I came away from my viewing of this thinking ""This is the most amazing documentary I have ever seen!"". I know that I'll be revisiting it on several occasions.",1454025600,5,2944,4.884
