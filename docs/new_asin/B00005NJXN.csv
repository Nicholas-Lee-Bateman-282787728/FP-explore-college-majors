This is a great boxed set, containing all episodes in their proper order as originally broadcast, including controversial episodes like #3: ""Hitler's Legacy"" that are sometimes left out of collections like these due to their now being considered in exceptionally poor taste (and they are, but they were a product of the times).  The transfers are excellent, DVD quality is good, and audio quality is very nice, too, preserving such details as episode #99 being the first to have been broadcast in stereo.

This boxed set also includes a very nice booklet with character sketches and notes from every one of the 155 episodes.

Any Lupin III fan who understands enough Japanese would not regret getting this box.  Do make sure to know some Japanese, though, because there is no English of any kind, either subbed or dubbed, here.",1460419200,,917,4.8152866242038215
