My 5 year old and 8 year old both sat through it. It's more for first graders, but any reading is great! It has animation, music, bright colors and repeating words. I had trouble getting my boys to stop watching it, and to come eat breakfast. It goes over 68 sight words. I know we'll be watching this DVD again and again!",1376870400,,485,4.11578947368421

He LOVES it!  He watches it in the car, in his playroom, and as a part of his homeschooling.  The songs are very catchy and I find myself humming them during the day.  I made my own sight word flash cards that we use after each DVD to reinforce what he's learning.  It's also the perfect guilt-free way to have 60 minutes to yourself to make dinner!  :)  Great for homeschooling or to get ready for Kindergarten.",1374451200,3,683,5.509615384615385

5694954,1,B00C7BZG68,"*** I am amending my review slightly. Everything I said below is still completely true, but I just got off the phone with the owner of the company. He politely listened to my complaints and explained the reasoning behind why they designed these DVD's as they have. I still think they're wrong and not useful at all. But the owner of the company Richard C. told me that even opened, he was happy to refund me the purchase price of all three Rock and Learn DVD's. So, while I think the DVD's are not good at all, I really have a lot of respect for this company now. I really appreciated the time Mr. C took to hear me out and listen to the reasons why an early childhood teacher thinks the DVD's are not good. Thank you sir, and good job running your company!***

I have been an early childhood teacher for a decade. I have taught on the kindergarten and first grade level and have spent every year teaching sight words. I promise I know what I am talking about. This DVD (and ALL of the other sight word DVD's from this company) are TERRIBLE. The way the words are presented is useless. They've made a cartoon that happens to have sight words on the screen. The screen of the television is simply WAY TOO BUSY for a child to know what to look at or that there are even words on the screen. All my son has done while watching these DVD's is watch the extremely colorful and very animated characters sing insipid songs and dance around. If I didn't sit with him and push pause every three to five seconds, he would not even know there were words on the screen. Just so I don't feel like my money was completely wasted (which it was) I sit with him through the entire DVD and pause it every time a word appears. I have to point out the word to him and say it several times while he repeats the words back to me. More often than not, he is upset that the DVD was paused and any learning becomes impossible. A child won't learn rote memorization of things if he is crying for the awful cartoon to start playing again. Seriously, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. The only reason my son is learning anything is because I've made flash cards of the words and take out each flash card as the word appears on the screen (while paused!!) and I match the flash card to the word. Then I repeat the word while pointing to it on the screen and then do the same with the flash card. There is a wonderful set of sight word DVD's that actually work, but I'm not going to mention them here because I don't want anyone to think I'm writing this to sell something else. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I am only successful at all with these DVD's because I have been teaching these words to children for years. If there was at least a flashcard setting, where the words would appear alone and would be repeated several times, there would be some saving grace to the DVD. There is no setting like this. All I do is come home from work and basically do the same thing I was doing at work during our ELA (English Language Arts) period. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. If you're a teacher and have the background knowledge to make these DVD's work, you can do it, but it's aggravating and time consuming. I cannot express how disappointed I am with this DVD. Whatever reviews you read that are glowing must be from the company or some paid reviewers. Please don't buy these, all you'll be doing is buying expensive cartoons for your child to watch. I might as well put on Spongebob for all the learning that is going on. At least Spongebob isn't quite so annoying to listen to while you make dinner.",1406678400,,3551,4.276374442793462
