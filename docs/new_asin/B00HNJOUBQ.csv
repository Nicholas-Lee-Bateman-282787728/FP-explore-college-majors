8633798,5,B00HNJOUBQ,"British narrator Christopher Glyn's emotive reading captures the beauty and power of God's Word and makes the King James English clear and easy to understand. On this one DVD-ROM is 66 hours of audio. 929 audio files. There is beautiful background music on some of the books and chapters. I usually load one or two books onto my MP3 player and listen to it while I have my daily run. They have audio samples of their recording on their Treasures365 website.
