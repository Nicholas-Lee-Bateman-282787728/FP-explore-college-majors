517818,5,6302763878,"This was the first of 110 hour long shows about a town in Alaska called Cicely and the wide range of personalities that inhabited it.  Northern Exposure was an hour of magic each week, a way to dream about far off  places and amazing occurences that just don't seem to happen in the lower  48.  Whether it be a snobby, narrow minded doctor from New York, a female  bush pilot who can't seem to keep a boyfriend alive, an Ex-con with a  penchant for philosophy and art, a Native American destined to be a Shaman,  a former Astronaut with deep pockets and a power complex, Queen of the  Northwest Passage, a Bartender who's the voice of reason and numerous guest  stars (Adam Arkin as ""Adam"" is my favorite).  With spectacular  scenery, outrageous storylines and loveable characters this was a reason to  watch tv.  Now it doesn't seem like there is much quality tv on the air and  so syndicated reruns of Northern Exposure are perfect for an hour of lazing  around and broadening your horizons and your outlook on life.  But it takes  a special breed of human to enjoy this show, anyone with an imagination and  dreams should take right to it.  Those who've forgotten how to be a child  and who deny any magic in their lives need not apply.",955843200,59,1239,4.495495495495495
517819,5,6302763878,"I used to live in Alaska and this is the most entertaining and accurate series ever, filled with laughter, love, saddness and joy of life through the eyes of the people of Cicely, Alaska.  Brand/Falsey, the producers,  were ground-breakers of quality on-location television.  Something for  everyone!  Highly recommend that you will see a part of yourself in this  friendly little fictional town amidst the beautiful scenery of  Alaska(actually filmed in Roselyn and Redmond, Washington).  I wish I could  go live in Cicely!  The people who live in Alaska come from all over the  country to live there because they WANT to, except the neurotic, whining  Joel Fleisman.  Eventually he falls in love with the townfolk and way of  life in the beautiful state of Alaska!",940291200,16,766,5.024

7831993,5,6302763878,"The ""Fish Out of Water"" story (a.k.a. the ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" story) is a narrative staple given all the different types of fish and all the myriad bodies of water available. ""Northern Exposure"" was about a young Jewish doctor from New York City, Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Murrow), who had his medical education paid for by the state of Alaska and consequently owes them several years of medical servitude. Fleischman expects to end up in a large hospital in the state's largest city, but instead ends up in the town of Cicely, a small logging village in the middle of nowhere where he gets to be the only doctor in town. To Fleischman, operating a free clinic in bombed out Beirut suddenly looks better.

""Northern Exposure"" was created by Joshua Brand & John Falsey, the same pair who gave us ""St. Elsewhere,"" and in the First Episode (First aired July 12, 1990) Fleischman arrives all ready to fulfill his obligation in repayment of the $125,000 the start anted up for medical school, but the hospital in Anchorage does not need him and his services have been bought, so to speak, by Maurice Minnifield (Barry Corbin), a former astronaut not developing his small part of the Alaska wilderness as a money making opportunity for tourism (and anything else he can think up).

""Northern Exposure"" is actually established as two shows in one. First the pilot shows Dr. Fleischman being introduced to the interesting characters in town, most notably Holling Vincoeur (John Cullum), Ed Chigliak (Darren E. Burrows) and Marily Whirlwind (Elaine Miles) in the pilot (One of the surprising things about the pilot is that John Corbett's Chris Stevens, who becomes the voice of Cicely on KBHR, has no dialogue in the first episode). One of the best sources of humor on the show is Fleischman's sense of outraged civilization beating impotently against the ways of the Native Americans. Ed and Marilyn listen to Dr. Fleischman, but they certainly do not obey.

Second, there is the constant battling and bickering between Fleischman and Maggie O'Connell (Janine Turner), the bush pilot who flies him to Cicely. Whereas everybody else in town takes Fleischman's outbursts in stride, Maggie insists on getting in his face and outbursting right back. Of course these two are going to end up in the sack together (actually it would be a literal role in the hay), and it is a question of whether we will be witnessing another romantic disaster a'la Dave and Maddie on ""Moonlighting"" (okay, not that bad, but it was not pretty). The two parts of the show did not exactly mesh, but in most episodes you were usually going to like most of the entwined plotlines.

""Cicely"" (First aired May 18, 1992) finds Joel encountering Ned Svenborg (Robert Blossom), a 108-year-old man who tells him the story of how the little Alaskan town of Cicely came to be back in 1909. It seems way back when the community was a cultural mecca known as ""the Paris of the North,"" established by a free-thinker named Cicely (Yvonne Suhor) and her companion Roslyn (Jo Anderson). As Ned tells his story, Joel imagines the town's present citizens as the characters in Ned's tale: Ed becomes the young Ned, Maurice is the power hungry Mace Mobrey, Chris is his hired gun Kit, Shelly is the young harlot Sally, Holling is Abe the man who loves her, and Maggie is missionary woman Mary OKeefe. Joel, of course, is Franz Kafka, who is struggling with an idea for a story about metamorphosis (Hmmmm).

As Ned tells the tale of how Cicely was intended to be a utopian paradise and her tragic fate, Joel appears to have some appreciation for what a special little town he is stuck in by a simple twist of fate. Of all the Cicely history episodes, this one is definitely the best. The final episode of the third season, ""Cicely"" was written by Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider, this episode was directed by Rob Thompson, and makes a nice counterpart to the pilot episode.  By the way, in Italy ""Northern Exposure"" was known as ""Un medico tra gli orsi,"" which translates as ""A doctor between the bears.""",1117152000,,4059,4.766714082503556

Created by Joshua Brand & John Falsey, the same pair who gave us ""St. Elsewhere,"" and if Joel Fleischman was a walking clich, at least the rest of the quirky characters in Cicely were offbeat enough that the ocean was a lot more interesting than the fish, who seriously needed to relax and eventually would (a little).  But that was rather difficult given the shock and anger he had to work through in the pilot episode (first aired July 12, 1990).  Fleischman arrives all ready to fulfill his obligation in repayment of the $125,000 the start anted up for medical school, but the hospital in Anchorage does not need him and his services have been bought, so to speak, by Maurice Minnifield (Barry Corbin), a former astronaut not developing his small part of the Alaska wilderness as a money making opportunity for tourism (and anything else he can think up).

""Northern Exposure"" would win the Emmy for Best Dramatic Series in 1992, which was interesting since it was obviously a comedy.  But the rule of thumb was always a half-hour show was a comedy and an hour-long show was a drama, which was before ""M*A*S*H"" became the first dramedy and then ""Moonlighting"" was nominated for both Best Drama and Best Comedy by the Directors Guild of America.  The next thing we knew there was ""The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,"" ""Hooperman,"" ""The 'Slap' Maxwell Story,"" and ""Northern Exposure.""  This pilot episode explains why the last one on that list lasted the longest.",1111104000,4,3557,4.80327868852459

This series has been over with for a long time, what is it you are waiting on? I have never been glued to a TV set before in my life until NE came to TV.
I, as well as others are extremely disappointed in this, so PLEASE begin recording this on DVD so the entire world population can once again watch the best series that was ever created.

7831996,5,6302763878,"If you like brilliant writing coming from the qwerkyest characters ever put on screen, than this is the show for you! I stumbled upon this show years back while channel surfing and have sought it out ever since. Awhile back, A&E ran it every day, and there was a marathon that I taped, but of course it was VHS. Having had DVD for two years now, I just can't watch VHS or broadcast TV anymore. Apart from the obvious video quality and sound issues, the incredible ease of navigation and repetition abilities of DVD's make VHS tapes more obsolete to DVD's than dinosaurs are to humans; it is that drastic a quality difference! PLEASE, PLEASE, PRETTY PLEASE release this brilliant drama/sitcom...IT DEFIES DESCRIPTION really, but you can't watch it for five minutes and not be a fan forever. The Northern Exposure fan base is huge. So speaking for Joel, Maggie, Maurice, Chris, Ed, Holling, Shelly, Marilyn, Ruth Ann, Adam, and Jesse The Bear; please release Northern Exposure so I can die a HAPPY MAN!!!",1076889600,4,1002,4.764367816091954

The players start at $89.00 and are as high as $600.00. There is a huge amount of good DVD stuff out there that will never be released here so that $100.00 bucks would be well spent. The $89.00 one is small and easy to slip into a crowded area. So instead of getting all my money the studio will only get a royalty. too bad for them.",1075593600,2,487,4.083333333333333

Nothing has topped it yet in pure escapist value. Inventive magic! The dynamics between all the characters makes the viewer yearn to belong to a Utopian Cicely of their own. Even though you can see the actors in their new roles trying to get their bearings, feeling out who they are going to be,  this pilot episode features a smooth ensemble cast.  They seemed to sense they'd be together for quite  awhile.  5 years in fact!  Joel provides constant City Mouse/Country Mouse contrast. This is the thinking person's TV.",1003449600,20,683,4.803418803418803
