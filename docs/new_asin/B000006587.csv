7903708,5,B000006587,"I wasn't going to ""review"" this film but I see it only received 3 stars by someone.  This film deserves at least 4 to 4 1/2 stars but I gave it five to counterbalance the aforementioned 3 stars.  I saw this film when it originally came out.  It is a well made film that just  ""clicks"" somehow.  The ""everyman"" character, played extremely well by Dustin Hoffman, is someone alot of guys can identify with---his indecision, his difficulty understanding women and what they want, for example.  The part where the wife is given doctors orders to have sex 2 times everyday  during business hours (to get pregnant)  so that Dustin has to leave his job at the bank for a ""break"" twice a day to the knowing smiles and derision of his fellow workers is my favorite part, I think.  For the small sum this film costs, it is very much worth a  ""look see"" and it may become one of your favorite movies as it for me.  Enjoy!  :o) Email:boland7214@aol.",1129852800,4,937,4.447058823529412
7903709,3,B000006587,"This is a superficial yet amusing comedy about an Italian man who marries despite his better judgement. Before Dustin Hoffman became a star in ""The Graduate"" he starred in this Italian subtitled film speaking his dialogue in English while dubbed by an Italian actor. Even with these cinematic barriers he displays his understated genius flair for comedy in quirky mannersims and facial misgivings as the hapless husband watching his Italian divorce-less marriage explode before his eyes. The premise here, an Italian wife too difficult to live with (think Sophia Loren throwing dinner plates) is shallow but the cast including Stefania Sanderelli as the wild bride is full of spirited conviction.",996969600,,696,5.336363636363636
