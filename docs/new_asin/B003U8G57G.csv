But, I have to say this. It is T I M E - L E S S!
That is with out a thought!
I use this to go to when quality is what it is all about! Great band! Session players!
I will end with this. Forget when someone has to comment on the top-left corner when it is really not there! (Too many hits........:).......)
Buy it! You will be happy!

4194657,5,B003U8G57G,"I promise you... the concert was a good as the DVD makes it out to be. They captured this perfectly. I still have my ticket stub, too. To have this - the crown jewel of my concert going career -  as a memento of my favorite musician at the ONE gig I attended of his two solo tours is a karmic joy. When they played Gimmie Shelter - the whole room shivered, shimmied and shouted along with the chorus. The opener, the Eddie Chochran tune, was so damn rowdy; it set the pace for the night. As Keith said... at the time: ""it's Saturday night and we're here to rock."" And, rock they did...",1402012800,7,585,4.131578947368421
4194658,5,B003U8G57G,"The human riff always delivers, even with some bum notes. The band he put together is soooo very tight. Turn up the volume!",1399334400,,123,4.391304347826087
4194659,5,B003U8G57G,"I' wearing it out because I just can't stop playing it so often, I've been really hooked on it for the last year since I bought it even much more than the previous show in 1988. My mucic video collection is huge and the videos I play the most are LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER & this one, the reason is keith's particular tuned-telecaster playing and the powerful drumming beat so close to Charly's on the TATTOO YOU album.

However, I'm looking forward to getting it on BD because this DVD is not updated for its aspect ratio as many other great videos on this format. The other thing that bothers me is the reference photo on the cover that misleads you on the period when the recording was made, the picture is very recent, Keith looks much older than in the actual video which was filmed in the nineties. That happens with other artits, for instance, Bruce Springsteen, though.",1397347200,2,882,4.5125
4194660,5,B003U8G57G,"You could tell the guys had a great time performing together.  It wasn't the best quality, but if you are a big Keith Richard's
  fan, you will want to own this recording.  It was a lot of fun watching it.",1395187200,,205,4.05
4194661,5,B003U8G57G,"Keith's second tour with this fantastic band. They are all very talented, on the top of their game. Been searching for this DVD for a while, as it's never been officially released in the US. Good quality import, strong sound quality. A great dangerous and bluesy version of Gimme Shelter.

ROCK ON!",1394496000,8,298,4.730769230769231
4194662,5,B003U8G57G,"What a pleasure to see Keith shine like he did.  You get so much Keith that it is thrilling; something that could never be said about a Stone's video.  It is a great film .. Keith is super generous about having the camera linger on his band mates. This is the first DVD that had me noticing the drummer -- Steve Jordan is a fantastic drummer and his biceps caused me to drool.  He is so cute - that beautiful smile.  When the camera would linger on Keith's face,  you could feel and see his passion. Then the  camera would slowly glide down and rest on his hands.  It was a thing of such beauty. Well, it feels good to get this off my chest. ""Happy,"" rocked like I couldn't believe. It was a firestorm.  Enjoy Enjoy...",1389744000,4,718,4.189781021897811
4194663,5,B003U8G57G,"I was pleasantly surprised how good this is. A great band that swings and rocks. Keith hits a few bum notes yet overall, it's a very entertaining DVD. Outstanding cover of ""Gimmie Shelter"".",1388275200,4,189,4.757575757575758

8405718,5,B003U8G57G,"This is GREAT, Keith is having a ball as a 48 yr old.  Ron Wood has nothing on Waddy Wachtel.",1503705600,,93,3.65
8405719,5,B003U8G57G,"Keith starts off the night by saying ""It's Saturday night and we're here to rock.""  He wasn't kidding.  Every song is delivered with energy and passion.  I couldn't stop watching the DVD until I'd been through it about four times.  Great mix of material from ""Main Offender"", ""Talk Is Cheap"" and a few from the Stones catalog.  The most surprising part for me was how much I enjoyed the reggae number ""Words of Wonder"".  The studio version from Main Offender pales in comparison to this live rendition.  The X-Pensive winos are a motley crew for sure, but they were unbelievably tight and the musicianship is exceptional throughout.  Aside from one sour note on the intro of ""Before They Make Me Run"" and a couple songs (including ""Happy"") where the jam went on a bit too long at the end, the performance is spellbinding.  You can tell that everyone on stage and in the audience was enjoying every minute of the ride.  Some of the highlights for me were ""Locked Away"" and ""Eileen"", but there are no disappointments whatsoever.  It was definitely worth the price.",1465776000,,1062,4.717391304347826

8405721,3,B003U8G57G,"The subtitiles are a bit annoying as is the never-ending Keith Richards & The Xpensive Winos logo in the top left corner.  Feels like a MTV to DVD video with the commercials cut out.

That said, the music is great, the audio quality and video quality is decent and that era of Keith is my favorite so worth the cash.",1456444800,,316,4.25
8405722,5,B003U8G57G,"This is an insanely good concert. It's just too good! Keef and his thug band really outdid themselves. You can tell they are giving it all! I certainly hope they had a good party after this show because I still can't get over how great the sound and performance is. This is just as good if not better then Live at the Palladium Dec '88 show. I love 999 and the cowbell you can hear about a minute into the song...I keep screaming ""more cowbell!""...LOL!!!",1449964800,,454,4.352941176470588

8405725,5,B003U8G57G,"Being a Rolling Stones enthusiast, I wasn;t quite sure what to  make of this selection of songs as only several are Stones songs However this disc was a real revelation to me as the music is excellent and so are the vocals and  also the musicians that Keith gathered around himself - especially Waddy Wachtel - the other guitarist.  Every night  that I listen to it seems to expand my desire to  grow. So I have also been looking up the various versions  of That Waddy fellow - what a talented guy but Keith knew that.  This is my favorite ""Stones"" DVD for now",1434758400,,560,4.326923076923077
