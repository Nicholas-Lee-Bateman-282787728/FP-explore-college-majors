7562615,5,B01943TQPI,"Based on The Twilight Zone episode ""A Stop at Willoughby,"" this retelling takes the plot farther, and to it's ultimately logical conclusion. Which is that a man can only live one life, and in only one time. When a modern graphic artist has to choose between the time he was born in and the time he can travel back into, his choice has the potential to change everything in both his worlds.

A great nostalgic romance for time travel buffs -- or anyone else who feels they were born in the wrong century. Mark Harmon is at his heroic best as the man who literally changes history for the woman he loves. Mary McDonnell is vulnerable and emotionally invested as the woman who learns that she is willing to take risks which the mores of her time don't support-- the biggest of which may be a life with him.",1462492800,7,803,4.389261744966443
7562616,4,B01943TQPI,"This is a re-working of a favorite Twilight Zone episode... except NOBODY dies in this one... except old age.
I happen to believe that there is NO SUCH THING as a bad Time Travel Movie... some are just better than others.
This movie has, both, likable and capable actors with---excuse the word---a SWEET story. It's closer to the movie
""SOMEWHERE IN TIME"" than ""Back To The Future""... there's no hard and fast rules as to W=H=Y I enjoyed this
flick... I just did, and despite a, somewhat, pricey investment, I added this to my collection after reading all of the
brief reviews praising it.",1462060800,4,589,4.673076923076923

8743837,5,B01943TQPI,"This is a great movie,absolutely nothing to dislike about it at all!  I'm not a great fan of Sci-Fi films normally,but this one sits comfortably between a Romance and a Fantasy,,and delivers a story of endless fascination,of lovers caught in a time warp,one hundred years apart!. The actors are superb,the dialogue discreet and mindful of the great differences in attitudes over a century,and the ending is highly satisfactory,with a slight twist to keep everybody happy,and feeling good!
This movie is a little gem,and while it would never have qualified for Blockbuster status,I got the distinct impression that the cast actually enjoyed making it...a film for the actors themselves, so to speak,so buy it, sit back with the whole family,and give yourselves a real treat!",1521590400,3,773,5.233870967741935
8743838,5,B01943TQPI,"FOR ALL TIME is a full-length movie taking place in the present era (era of laptop computers) for about three quarters of the time and in March 1896 for about a quarter of the time.  The main characters are Mark Harmon who plays the time-traveler and Mary McDonnell, who plays a newspaper editor in the year 1896 in Somerville.  The present-day era location appears to be downtown St. Louis, while the March 1896 location is a rural village called, Somerville.  The segue between these two locations is mediated by a passenger train.  When on the train, and after the journey is underway, Mark Harmon looks out the window and notices the the scenery includes horse-drawn carriages and other things from a long-gone era, and Mark Harmon eventually decides to get off when the train stops at Somerville.

THE FILM'S INSPIRATIONS.  The film was based, to some extent, on A Stop at Willoughby an episode of the Twilight Zone written by Rod Serling.  A Stop at Willoughby is one of the 10-best of all of the T.Z. episodes (more on that below).  However, the plot of FOR ALL TIME does not closely track or imitate the plot of A Stop at Willoughby, despite the fact that the introductory credits at the beginning of FOR ALL TIME acknowledges A Stop at Willoughby.  Another plot element is taken from Back to the Future, starring Michael J. Fox, where the main character goes back in time, and where the plot includes the element where visitors to the past can change the future.  I have watched A Stop at Willoughby on at least twenty occasions, and in watching this movie, I tried detecting similar elements in both movies.  However, after about 15 minutes, I noticed that FOR ALL TIME was not in any way an inspiration, and so I was no longer distracted by any impulse to compare the two movies.

MAGIC NEGRO.  A standard term used for television plots and movie plots is ""The Magic Negro.""  This is not a degradative term, and it is not a compliment either.  It is just descriptive.  Magic Negro is an African-American who has some sort of psychic power or supernatural power to make the life of a white person better.  Bill Cobbs plays the magic negro.  Bill Cobbs has starred in about 80 movies and in many television shows.  It is my guess that I am the last person in America to have heard of Mr. Bill Cobbs.  Anyway, Bill Cobbs plays the role of an antique dealer who sells Mark Harmon a magic antique watch, which is necessary for converting a present-day passenger train into a century-old passenger train that brings Mark Harmon to Somerville.  Also, Bill Cobbs plays the train conductor, and he is on the present-day train as well as on the 100-year old train.

PART OF THE PLOT.  The plot involves a creative artist in an advertising agency who becomes unhappy or uncomfortable with his own life.  In fact, he and his wife have lost interest in each other, though the movie does not show them to be experiencing any harsh friction between each other.  Their relationship can be summarized by the lyrics to a song recorded by B.B. King, ""The Thrill is Gone.""

MARY McDONNELL.  We all loved Mary McDonnell in Dances with Wolves, and I am always impressed at her ability to speak English with an accent acquired by not speaking English for many decades.  In Dances with Wolves, she plays a character who was captured by Indians when she was a small child and then raised by Indians, becoming fluent in the Lakota language.  As part of the plot of Dances with Wolves, she meets Kevin Costner, and is required by her tribe to communicate with Kevin Costner in English.  One of the many great high-points in Dances with Wolves, is her ability to use a very strange accent, of a person speaking English who has not spoken nor heard English for many decades.  What came as a revealing shock to me, when watching FOR ALL TIME, is that when she speaks English in other movies, she still talks in the same weird way.  In Dances with Wolves, her accent is similar to those of deaf people who have been trained to speak.  Perhaps it is like a Hungarian accent.  In FOR ALL TIME, she also speaks in this weird way, but not as pronounced as in Dances with Wolves.  In my opinion, the slightly weird way that Mary McDonnell speaks makes the plot more believable, in that, the plot feature of time-travel to rural America about 100 years back in time is made more believable.

CONCLUSION.  The conclusion takes the form of a surprise ending.  The conclusion has a cliff-hanger, no actually two cliff-hangers, and these resolve themselves in a good way.  A fine movie, perhaps worthy of two or three viewings over the course of the years.

TWILIGHT ZONE.  As I mentioned above, A Stop at Willoughby could be characterized as one of the ten best of the T.Z. episodes.  My other favorites (m all-time-great favorites) include A Piano in the House, Kick the Can, One for the Angels, Time Enough at Last, Printer's Devil, Steel, Cavender is Coming, and Mind and the Matter.",1520035200,,4957,4.6118721461187215
