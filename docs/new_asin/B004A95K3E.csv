4304077,4,B004A95K3E,"Gateway Church celebrated its tenth anniversary this year.  With an attendance of 16,000 people on a given Sunday, this Dallas-Ft. Worth-based church is becoming nationally and internationally influential, especially with its worship music.  God Be Praised is Gateway Worship's third live album, alongside five other studio albums, the first having been produced in 2003.

Gateway Worship appears to have emerged largely out of the Christ for the Nations Institute (CFNI), a Bible school from the Pentecostal/charismatic tradition.  It appears that as CFNI raises up young, talented worship leaders (including, notably, Dove award-winner Kari Jobe), they send them to Gateway.  Some hail Gateway as the Hillsong of the United States.  To me, at least stylistically, New Life Church (Colorado Springs, CO) seems like a closer parallel.

REVIEW SUMMARY

God Be Praised is a typical-sounding, live ""arena worship"" album, with an array of lead singers and worship leaders.  It verges on being more ""contemporary"" than ""modern"" in worship-style, and it displays a sensible array of worship-expression--praise, adoration, confession, lament.  My favorite songs (and therefore the songs I'd most likely incorporate at our church), musically and textually, are ""O the Blood"" and ""Faithful God.""  It is a solid album with exquisite moments of inspiration, but it does not jump out to the listener, either musically or theologically, as extraordinary.

4304133,4,B004A95K3E,"I have always bought my CD directly from the Gateway Church so this review is mostly centered on the music. The music is good live worship music, mixes both orginal and classic styles to a well put together high energy CD. CD is best enjoyed Track 1 to the end in one shot. I commute 2 hrs each day and this CD helps mold my mind towards God and loving others.

I would not recommened you buy from Amazon, the price looks way to high I only paid $8 for my copy directly from Gateway I suppose you are paying for middle man costs and shipping is free so that makes up for it.",1324425600,,574,4.035087719298246
