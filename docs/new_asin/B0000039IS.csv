1177623,1,B0000039IS,"This DVD is NOT the DVD that people have reviewed here.

Jimmy Durante and Donald O'Connor are NOT on this DVD.

There is NO feature movie on this DVD.

It does contain 4 hour long Colgate Comedy Hour programs from different years in the early fifties that are very funny.",1208131200,8,272,4.4
1177624,5,B0000039IS,"This dvd is just chalk full of big-name stars such as Rosemary Clooney, Burt Lancaster, and Vera Miles.  Burt Lancaster does a skit with Jerry and Dean about an escaped lunatic which is just hilarious.  Vera Miles does another skit with Dean and Jerry as Dean's wife.  They go to an orphanage to adopt Jerry for their son.  The comedy will have you rolling!  Check out little Jerry Mathis (Beaver) at the orphanage.  I would highly recommend this dvd for the exceptional comedy and also the great price!",1161561600,12,503,4.659090909090909
1177625,4,B0000039IS,"If you're a huge fan of Martin and Lewis, you've GOT to own this. If you're a casual fan or unfamiliar with them, you should see it. From their start as separate performers, to their first union as a team at the Copacabana, their rise to stardom and their breakup ten years later, this 2 video set is packed full with rare and special moments in their history. But it is NOT complete without Part 3, which seems to be missing from this set. Part 3 details their separate career paths leading to the gem of this video, which is a clip from the Jerry Lewis MDA telethon in 1976 when Frank Sinatra brought them back together for the first time in 20 years. It'll bring tears to your eyes. The only bad part is that it doesn't show ALL of Deans' time on the telethon which included a duet with Frank during which there was some brief exchanges between Dean and Jerry showing that the magic between them was still there.

My advice is to wait until this is reissued, hopefully on DVD, with the missing Part 3 included. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because of the exclusion of Part 3.",1150588800,,1100,4.2631578947368425

7902352,5,B0000039IS,"There were only a few episodes on the Comedy Hour but they are great.  I remember watching them on TV when I  was a teen and they were some of the funniest shows I had ever seen at the time.  After watching the shows again, over 60 years later, they are still the funniest comedies I have seen in my life. I laughed so hard tears were streaming from my eyes.

Timeless comedy with great showmanship by Martin and Lewis.  This is a must have for Martin and Lewis fans - as well as those too young to remember them.

The videos were grainy but that is to be expected.",1374969600,,565,4.090909090909091

7902355,5,B0000039IS,"I love Martin & Lewis! They are the funniest pair of actors I have ever seen in movies, and they are even funnier in their appearances on the Colgate Comedy Hour TV. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves side-splitting, knee-slapping comedy for the whole family! Even if you don't have a wacky, zany sense of humor, try it anyway -- you may be very pleasantly surprised.",1351814400,,380,4.521739130434782
7902356,1,B0000039IS,"Well I want to start off by saying that this is a very funny collection of Martin and Lewis and a great addition to any collection. The only problem is,I already have every single episode. Either the other reviewers got a different set or maybe they sent me the wrong one. I read in the reviews that I would be getting the Colgate skit where Dean adopts Jerry but that is nowhere to be seen. In my package was 2 cd's. The first one had At war with the Army and two Colgate's one with Rosemary Clooney and one with Polly Bergen. The second cd has three Colgates;Burt Lancaster,Tony Curtis,and Marilyn Maxwell. The only way it differs from the dvd set I already have is that this one has the original commercials. I was very disappointed and I hope that the next person buying this product gets what they were hoping for.",1330387200,,819,4.394736842105263
7902357,5,B0000039IS,"I thought I was getting a DVD but ended up with VHS, still some of the funniest stuff ever done.  If you want an idea what all the Hu-hu about Lewis And Martin, get this and you'll see at their peak, no one came close and ever will.",1232064000,,232,3.8333333333333335
