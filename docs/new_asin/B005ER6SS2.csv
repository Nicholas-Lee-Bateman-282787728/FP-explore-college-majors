Reviewed by Mike Haushalter

The Resurrection Game is a refreshingly witty and wickedly funny take on the zombie genre. It's chock full of gore and snappy dialogue.  A rare zombie effort where the the human story takes the forefront while the zombies are just an already excepted part of life like pollution or drug addicts.

The storyline is engrossing and the script is very clever and full of in jokes and funny one-liners. The cast is great and seems to have had a great time in their respective roles. Cast highlights include Jasi Cotton Lanier  and the always-busy Debbie Rochon in cameos. The film's director (writer, editor etc.) Mike Watt shows up as a deadly replicant(looking quite a bit like Benny The Jet Urquidez). His lovely wife Amy Lynn Best plays a sexy zombie killing nun named Sister Bliss. And Bill Homan is Simon MacForman, Bliss's Zombie slaying competitor.

As far as the Zombie action goes I'd have to say that the Zombie makeup is run of the mill (not necessarily a drawback) but they are dispatched in fun and interesting (not to mention gory) ways. Another slight drawback is that that no master shots for some of the Zombie stomping was filmed (do to budget constraints no doubt) and it disrupts the flow of the action in some of the films bigger battles. Despite all that this is one fun zombie flick and I highly recommend it (unless you're one of those Zombie purists that think Zombie films shouldn't be fun and to hell with you people anyway).

The Resurrection Game has seen several different releases on VHS and DVD over the years with several variations of editing this 10th Anniversary Edition is ""the"" definitive release and is chock full of fun and informative extras and very funny menu animations featuring NecroPhil",1335916800,,1781,4.800653594771242
