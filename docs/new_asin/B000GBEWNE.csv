8130393,5,B000GBEWNE,"This cartoon is a play on to ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", during the present time. I would think it would be okay for Children from about 5 years on up. It is a cute movie, but might have some scary parts in it. So I would suggest that You watch it first. My copy was perfect.",1461456000,,278,3.8947368421052633
8130394,2,B000GBEWNE,"Looks like this is currently streaming for free on YouTube...and at that price, I still felt ripped off. I think the thing that really hurts with this, is that I remember seeing this with my son when he was just a little boy, but I had forgotten the title of it. I remembered the basic story, but couldn't remember what the thing was called. So after doing some digging and thanks to some folks on the horror forum at Amazon I was able to track it down. When I saw that the copies here were going for $30+, I was still tempted to give it a purchase, until I found it for free online.

So I sit down with the kids last night to re-visit this ""lost"" Halloween special.

I had a ""Happy Days"" moment. Remember how in the 1970's everybody loved the TV show ""Happy Days"", and the character of the Fonz? Remember how they even put Fonzie's leather jacket in the Smithsonian. Every loved that show. Have you ever gone back and tried to re-watch an episode of ""Happy Days""? If you have fond memories of watching Ritchie, Potsy and Ralph...then do yourself a favor and keep those happy memories, don't go back to re-visit the show. It's horrible, and unwatchable.

For me ""The Haunted Pumpkin of Sleepy Hollow"" was like that. It's horrible, stilted animation, horrible voice casting, and while the basic premise is good, the presentation is awful. If you have little kids like 7 and under, maybe give it a shot, otherwise avoid this Trick on Halloween.",1414454400,,1442,4.4961832061068705

8130396,5,B000GBEWNE,Great price. Delivered promptly. Just as described.,1407888000,,51,6.428571428571429
8130397,4,B000GBEWNE,"This is a good Halloween pick for kids and it's not too scary.

Great quality animation and production. The story starts out strong, but gets a little lost in the end trying to work too much in.

Still, most kids won't notice and will enjoy it--probably watching it more than once.

I'd call it a little unknown Halloween Gem!",1381104000,,326,4.491525423728813

8130400,4,B000GBEWNE,Had been looking for a Halloween video that wasn't too scary - that both my 6 and 3 year old could enjoy.  They both loved this movie and have watched it a lot this Halloween season. I had never heard of it before and was pleasantly surprised - not too scary but not too babyish either.,1351123200,2,286,4.107142857142857
8130401,4,B000GBEWNE,"This is a cute movie with a surprisingly catchy title song that sounds like it belongs in Scooby Doo.  Oddly enough though this movie does not have an IMDB listing.  I wonder why.

This is definitely a fun Halloween movie for children of any age.",1313020800,3,246,4.4222222222222225
8130402,5,B000GBEWNE,"This movie was surprisingly fun!  My 6 yr old loved it and so did I!  It had just the right amount of ""scariness"" to it for children.  I would definately reccommend it for viewers of all ages.",1289520000,4,192,4.135135135135135
