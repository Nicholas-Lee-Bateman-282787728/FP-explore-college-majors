8240951,1,B00118SUIY,"For anyone buying this hoping to see Rutger Hauer, don;t bother.  He has maybe 5 minutes on film and is neither Naked nor Lustful!  A complete waste of a lot of money for an old dubbed DVD with people who ahve no idea how to act!  Wish I could get my money back!  This is a waste of time, money and a waste of Rutger's talents as well!",1427673600,,335,3.8823529411764706
8240952,3,B00118SUIY,"It was a typical movie of that time period.  The acting was bad, as well as the music.  But I purchased it only for Rutger Hauer being in it and didn't enjoy it because his voice was dubbed.",1209686400,3,190,3.973684210526316
