I don't laugh out loud too often but this show had my laughing til I couldn't breathe.  I'd have to rewind several parts to hear what was said just because I couldn't hear them over my laughter.  This is in the vein of Jackass but seems ""smarter"" if that's a good way to put it.",1200441600,,447,4.0
