5391203,4,B00A704M5C,"Light fare `Romantic Island' is likely best enjoyed on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  Its strength lies in its strong casting and relatable situations, but the actors were not utilized to their full potential and the storyline was not entirely believable.",1381104000,,251,5.275
5391214,5,B00A704M5C,Great story. Happy and uplifting. The acting and production values were excellent. Entertaining from beginning to end.,1420156800,,118,6.0
5391215,1,B00A704M5C,"None of the couple's stories related to one another. It was basically a documentary of 3 individual different pairs. As I watched, I wondered the whole time: will those pairs eventually meet together? or, what's the point of showing many different pairs without a connection? The acting was just so-so. All the actors and actress (accept for the older couple) didn't know how to express happiness, sad, or angry... When I was watching, I was confused about the expressed emotions; hence, I was not drawn into the romance they tried to build up. Nothing was excited about the story. Cimetography wasn't great and couldn't capture the beauty of the island. Which was too bad because the island's beauty could totally boost up the movie's name, ""romantic.""",1416873600,,753,4.984126984126984

5391221,4,B00A704M5C,"Romantic Island is about 6 people who go to an island in the Philippines for different reasons. 2 people are already a couple but the other 4 become couples while on the getaway.
Couple A : Rich man with jaded attitude meets a working class girl whose family depends on her financially. Their's is a slow to kindle relationship that's sweet & made me smile throughout the movie
Couple B:
Burned out Singing Diva runs away from her duties & bosses a  fellow vacationer into helping her get situated on the island. As she relaxes, she opens up to him. Unfortunately she picked the most awkward, socially inept guy to do it with. He is a star struck idiot, who truly enjoys her company,yet stupidly brags about spending time with her to his friends. He has a high tolerance for being pushed around & the diva seems to be real with him,is that Romantic ? ~ Slightly~
 Lastly, we have hardworking couple C:
 A guy with a brain tumor intends to kill himself, but then can't so he pays someone to do it for him. This is so the woman he loves & their daughter can have the insurance money...really NOT romantic....they try to make his suicide attempts light hearted, but it's just not funny. Plus there is the mystery of whether or not a very young boy is an assassin and the speculation that he will shoot one of the men from one of the couples....that is definitely not funny or romantic !
  The English subtitles aren't horrible & the movie tidies up all lose ends but I wouldn't say that this is a very romantic movie. I will admit that the story of couple A made me smile throughout the movie, (reminding me of Audrey Hepburn & Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday :free spirited girl and stuffy guy)  If you want a truly romantic beach movie, see Love you you...that's romantic !",1405555200,,1770,4.447530864197531

8547370,4,B00A704M5C,"Love this movie.  I have watched it two times, like a couple of the other review...it is not super romantic; but it is wonderful.  I like Korean Drama better than American Drama because you don't have to deal with the sex and unnecessary scenes.  I love how they used 3 different types of couples and they all ended up happy in the end.",1420934400,,336,4.301587301587301
