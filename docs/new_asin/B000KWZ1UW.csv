Very different from its pedecessors,yet still full of action fun!!!",1187222400,,166,4.758620689655173
2697792,3,B000KWZ1UW,"I bought this the other day having seen it on 4Kids one saturday. I'm a fan of the turtles so whether its that great or not I'll buy it just to have it probably lol but yea this is decent enough.

Don't expect it to be overly mature or as dark as the previous incarnation. It can be be described as probably a mixture of the first and the 2003 series. They don't look overly childish but at the same time they aren't that as dark as you'd maybe expect.

I'm almost through the two discs and maybe its because I've only recently starting watching again, I dunno, but I've pretty much enjoyed it. It was a bit of a dissapointment but if you give it a chance its not that bad.

I'm actually looking forward to season two. (I'm  18 by the way and its just as entertaining and engaging as it can be in my opionion)",1179187200,3,809,4.10126582278481

2697794,4,B000KWZ1UW,"i've read everybody else's reviews about this dvd, and agree/disagree with what has been said. True, this isn't like the ""dark"" seasons of the show previous to this one BUT i've actually enjoyed most of the episodes. Now that i've seen recently released episodes from this show, it actually gets better. There is an episode titled ""Graduation Day 2105"" that actually deals with the turtle brothers, rather than battle an evil villain. Michaelangelo is the main character in this episode - which is a nice change. Other episodes involve Torbin Zixx, an original character that i've actually enjoyed watching. I know that this is supposed to be a review of the current dvd, but i'm just saying that though people say that this show is lame, it does have some fresh characters that make you wonder how the rest of the season will be (and end!). The two disappointments are that Splinter isn't drawn the same as he was in the previous seasons (which i really enjoyed!), and the turtles aren't as muscular as the previous seasons which i would think that being warriors they would have that. And yeah...the ""it's ninja time"" line has gotten a bit old - very sad. Overall, i actually enjoy this season. Just wish there was more extra features and info on the dvd discs other than the episodes. Hope this review helped you!",1177113600,,1316,4.726086956521739
2697795,5,B000KWZ1UW,"great set if you havnt seen the series its colorful and lost its dark edge and story line, and villians but its worth it if your turtle fan its still has the comedy and everything and only two same villians triceritons, and bishop mikeys jokes are even more colorful and funny than the orignal mikey joke ( i knew i felt a glitch in the matrix ) if 4kids makes more sets just like this one with the other turtle series i will be greatly stisfide so i no need to buy only single dvds to bad they make a set in an uncut version edition that i came across a net a couple of times.",1173916800,,577,3.9827586206896552
2697796,1,B000KWZ1UW,"I watched Fast Forward, and I will not purchase the dvds.  Fast Forward left behind the complex, well-written, and nicely animated TMNT series of 2003+.  With Fast Forward, the TMNTs are in a brightly colored, flatly drawn world of trite dialogue spoken by two-dimensional characters.  There is nothing distinctly TMNT about the show anymore.  Splinter and the Turtles could be replaced by any good-guy characters,  with no impact on the series.  It is as if the Turtles, and Splinter, were plunked into a generic storyline, instead of having an original storyline inspired by the characters themselves.  I've been a fan of the TMNT for some time, and I will continue to be a fan of the Turtles.  I am not a fan of Fast Forward.",1166572800,5,728,4.768
2697797,5,B000KWZ1UW,"I've been watching most of Fast Forward and the tone is definately lighter in the tone of the show. Most people doomed the new take before it started and most didn't watch more than a few episodes. The show however remains making references to continuity and slowly explaining the stuff that has changed over the future, it also slowly builds a story arc that is very interesting with each continous episode. The show is still set to go darker on the next 13 episodes as well.

In conclusion, while a little different than the regular 2k3 show, it still has most of the qualities that made the 2k3 show so good, it is definately worth the 11$ price tag it has.",1166486400,4,660,4.454545454545454
2697798,1,B000KWZ1UW,"I am very disappointed in TMNT: Fast Forward. The episodes are just boring. It's really a shame cause the 2003 series was such a brilliant series with great characters and story continuity. 4Kids really ruined TMNT with this horrible fast forward nonesense. I am all for trying new things, and I don't hate Fast forward for being too campy, after all I am a hardcore fan of the original 1987 series, but this is just painful to watch. I am not going to buy this DVD, I have seen all the episodes and none of them have any redeeming quality. I am saving my money for The Ninja Tribunal Season, which takes place after the forth season. I really hope 4Kids won't ruin the 2003 series for us fans by not releasing The Ninja Tribunal season, in favour of Fast forward. That would really be a shame!!",1165795200,5,795,4.414965986394558
2697799,2,B000KWZ1UW,"TMNT: Fast Forward takes the Turtles from the revamped 2003 series and tosses them 100 years into the future. There they team up with Cody Jones, great grandson of April and Casey, and must learn to live in a world now teeming with alien life.

This show reeks of corporate interference all over. The original 2003 series, despite its obvious problems, took itself seriously and featured an ongoing storyline that gave the characters something to do. It was also reasonably well animated, especially in the later seasons when the show amped up its fight choreography and featured varying colour palettes.

All this seems to be gone with Fast Forward. The action has been toned down to generic brawls, the animation is flat and the colours are garish and bright. The writers seem to be building some kind of ongoing story, one featuring Cody's corrupt uncle and another featuring an alien threat; it's vaguely interesting, just nowhere near as fun as the old Shredder, Bishop, Hun, Karai stories. In-between there are lots of pointless filler adventures and Cody Jones is shoved down the viewers' throats every episode. As the obligatory kid character he could be worse, but he's not a character you'll miss. And ""It's Ninja Time!"" is just stupid and grating.

Really, the show isn't quite Ninja Turtles anymore, you could replace our heroes with anyone and the dynamics wouldn't change. It's still amusing every so often, and over the course of these 13 episodes the show does seem to find its comfort zone. It's probably for the best that 4Kids is giving us a cheap 2-disc set, as the series would be hard to recommend otherwise.",1165622400,15,1630,4.877256317689531

8159234,5,B000KWZ1UW,"The 2003 TMNT series is one of the best, and this part of the series holds true to that. Of course these don't follow the comics at all like the earlier seasons did of this show. But Fast Forward is for sure a fun and light hearted version if the bad-a turtles, but it's fun. If you're buying this for your kids they'll love it. And if you're buying if for yourself, you already know you want it.",1407283200,,396,4.089743589743589

It was a diffrent  spin on them. It was a fun ride. If you are a fan you want this in your collection. Worth to have.,1383955200,,273,3.55
8159236,3,B000KWZ1UW,"For some reason Ninja Tribunal was shelved and Fast Forward was aired, where the turtles and Master Splinter traveled to the future. Cody Jones, the great-grandson of Casey and April, takes them in and tries to help them find a way home.

TMNT: Fast Forward is a more kid-friendly version of the 2003 incarnation. It took me awhile to warm up to the new season and I'm glad that it was only on one season.",1345680000,2,690,4.488
8159237,4,B000KWZ1UW,"This is season 6... not many fans welcomed this season. preferable the older fans or long time fans like me. But to little kids this must be gold. heres some backstory about this season and why they made it:

Season 4 was dark and gloomy,featuring monsters and mutants and depressing stories of their treatment. Episodes like dragons brew and i monster made 4kids wonder if maybe the mood needed a little lightening. then a big mix-up happened. Appearantley a new employee for the broadcasting network caused a mishap and a TMNT episode was created that didn't follow the network standards. the notorious banned episode ""Insane in the membrane"", Its not secret because it was included in the season 4 DVD and streamed at 4kids website. Insane in the membrane is something from a touching horror film full of gore and despressing moments. Think dragons brew but with 10x more sadness and 10x more gore. Although the episode was never aired, word still got out that 4kids let this happen. So they quickly finished season 4 with the episode entitled ""ninja tribunal"", which was a cliff hanger. That episode shouldnt have been the season finale. Good genes part 2 makes more sense because it explains how the mystics broke free. You would expect the new season to be about this strange organization and the tengu shredder. nope. Heres what happened: the turtles get captured by a strange organization and are going on a ship to japan. Next week: The turtles are recovering from dons mutation then they get sent to the future. I think ""ninja tribunal"" should have been aired after fast forward. the season was but not the cliffhanger that explains the season. After the season 4 dark and gloom, playmates suggested that 4kids change the direction to something light and corny to boost toy sales. Thus fast forward was made... to bad as soon as playmates got their wish TMNT cgi came out and fast forward only got 1 toy line. Epic fail!

Story: the turtles are sent to the future by accident. they meet so many boring secondary characters and villians you won't remember them. the only real villians who gets more than 10 episodes screen time is shokanabo and viral.

Vaule: good price for 1 half of the season.

overall: decent but volume 2 ""day of awakening"" has an actual arc in it.",1329696000,,2279,4.747474747474747
8159238,3,B000KWZ1UW,"This is the first half of Season 6 of the 2003 turtles, while taking them to another time.  The turtles get transported to a futuristic New York City and wondering how they got there.  They meet up with Cody Jones, great-grandson of Casey Jones and April O'Neil, in a New York City that lives together with Aliens.  While the time traveling has been done in the third live action movie but with this it's different scenario.  While the first 4 seasons dealt with the turtles being mostly in NYC itself while taking them to other places, while season 5 dealt with learning to deal with greater enemy.  How can they prepare for a city that's 100 years into the future?  Some of the things that made the first 5 seasons good, are kind of still here while at the same time the writing seems to be different for this season of this show, dealing with new enemies.

One in particular is Sh'Okanabo, who is an alien who is apparently trying to get control of NYC and the other being Cody's uncle, who doesn't seem to want Cody to have any word in the family business.  The first half of this season starts of all right, though in a different direction than that of what's already on the table.  Overall I give this set 3.5 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,1231,4.364035087719298
8159239,5,B000KWZ1UW,"I was a little hesitant to purchase this DVD, never having watched this season on TV.  I had heard some bad things about this season, such as the change in animation style and the fact that this season was made to sell more toys.  I was very glad to ignore those things and pick it up anyway.  You get used the animation change right away, its really not that big a deal.  Once you watch a couple of episodes, you realize this is still the same Turtles that started this wonderful series in 2003.  There is definitely continuity from the previous seasons.  I enjoyed this half of the season but the next half is even better.  If you love the TMNT, you've got to pick this up.",1237852800,,675,4.267716535433071
8159240,5,B000KWZ1UW,"heres the deal folks. this show is currently redlining in saeson 7 back to the sewers. why? because its the same thing over and over. as much as i love the show and continue to watch it. its always hun the shredder in some form baxter and so on. its the same old thing. they need to work on ending the show then start over again in my opinion. OR start introducing new bad guys. like bring in slash from the old series. bring the evil turtles back from the future they are seen in fast forward. or have the utrom crang go nuts some how and start up the whole dimension x story from the original series. anyway now i want to talk about fast forward. the reason this season works so well is because it takes you away from the norm for a whole season. even brings back heros and badguys from the past. the plot ideas are very welcomed. and could not be done in the p[ast that is why fast forward works. its all fresh ideas, stories and badguys. the show needs more changing up like they did with fast forward otherwise they need to work on a official ending for the show before it gets canceled. for those of you that hate fast forward. i understand but fear not the turtles are back in old new york in season 7 back to the sewers. the first episode is the finale of fast forward and the beginning of back to the sewers.",1227571200,,1317,4.1484375
