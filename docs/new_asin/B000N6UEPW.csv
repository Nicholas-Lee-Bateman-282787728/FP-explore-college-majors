8175291,5,B000N6UEPW,Loved this series! I very much regret selling my season complete collection for $10 in a yard sale years ago. I had to pay almost $10 per volume to get the season collection back. I hate how distributors stop making a product and make it in demand. Older anime has pretty much died. I tried very hard to find the complete series but only found it used for $99~. Since this review is general and is meant for all volumes avoid the volumes that are over $10. They are trying to rip you off. Shop smart and you can buy all the volumes for under $50. It might not all be from Amazon though.,1422576000,,586,4.149122807017544
8175292,5,B000N6UEPW,"My-Hime is one of those animes that you come across usually by accident. When that happened to me I thought, ""where the heck have they been hiding this one all these years?"" It's great. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting isn't too bad either. What gives this series 5 stars is the story. It has very good characters and character development. You get attached to them very quickly and feel for them when the tragedies strike. Believe me there is a lot of tragedy in this story. It's technically a mecha anime I guess, but it's not conventional. The mecha aren't giant humanoid robots, nor are they the focus of the story the mecha are actually summoned by the Hime (princesses) to fight the demons that are after the ones they love. The demons are only a precursor to a giant plot that is very sinister and dark. While only one Hime can survive you won't want to let go of any of them. They are mostly just average girls with people they want to protect.

This anime is great. It has a good mixture of emotion and action. You should definitely check it out.",1354752000,2,1072,4.414141414141414
8175293,5,B000N6UEPW,"a wonderous opera that will help you understand love even if you thought you already did. I recommend everyone that has a passion for anime to see this and also those that don't too, and if someone would make a live action movie to this story it would be something great (no changing the story-line for ratings, etc.)",1336780800,,317,4.482758620689655
8175294,5,B000N6UEPW,"My Hime is one of the very best in recent Shoujo anime.  The end, while not as hard-hitting as I had hoped, brings the story to a close with grace and gusto.  I enjoyed the series and intend to watch it through again to catch details I missed the first time.  A subtle and well crafted series with a powerful ending - the best shoujo anime of 2007 is My Hime.",1189987200,2,359,4.028169014084507
8175295,3,B000N6UEPW,This disc ends the show and while I thought I knew how everything was going to turn out I was surprised.  It was an ok end to a decent series.,1188086400,,142,3.7333333333333334
