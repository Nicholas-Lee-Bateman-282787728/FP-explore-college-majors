7897296,5,630591110X,Another great Oliver Gruner movie.  I wish MST3K was still around to give movies like this their special treatment.  If you're a B Movie lover like I am you'll enjoy this one.,1419206400,,175,4.4375
7897297,3,630591110X,I know a lot of people do not like this movie but I do. I personally like it better then the sequel. I guess I enjoyed the country side thrill ride rather then watching them chase an alien inside of a large container the whole time in Interceptor Force 2.,1271203200,,255,4.12
7897298,4,630591110X,"The poor reviews for this movie are almost as entertaining as a room full of snobs! This is just a movie, and it's quite a bit of fun for those of us who can see it for what it really is! Movies are nothing more than a distraction from our own lives, and this one only needs a big bowl of popcorn and some soft drinks and someone who wants to forget the real world for a little while... The fight scene at the beginning and in the cantina are lots of fun! And the 'skyhook' stunt at the end of the first fight scene is priceless. Anyone who thinks they need reality in movies needs to shut the TV off and go outside and live their own life!",1258070400,6,640,3.9689922480620154
7897299,1,630591110X,"an alien ship lands in a small Mexican town and The Interceptor Force, lead by chisled Oliver Gruner, are sent in to find out what's going on...soon, they lose a team member in the process of arriving and things get a little fishy when the boss, Brad Dourif decides to send a missle to blow up the town and get rid of any evidence. Gruner's team consists of actor Glenn Plummer (Speed 1 and 2, Salton Sea) and actress exPlayboy Playmate Angel Boris (hot but cant act worth crap). Gruner gets in trouble with the Mexican leader and his Mexican Mafia...they run around...they get taking over by the alien force, big fights, alien phaser guns shooting, Gruner running away from big explosion, town go boom and then Gruner get up, he get slapped by woman with purse and then years later they make even more stupid sequels (Interceptor Force 2 and Phantom Force (with 21 Jump Street heartthrob Richard Grieco) with even more stupid actors. Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters 1 and 2), why the hell did you sign up for this? A pile of alein poo",1116547200,5,1030,4.572972972972973
7897300,1,630591110X,"This has definitely become my very favorite, toppling Deep Blue Sea from the top of my list of raspberry films. It is not only that the plot is anything but plausible - the acting is awful and the punch lines are out of line. Unlike other sci-fi spoofs, this movie has very few jokes that make it worth viewing.

Only the extras among the cast playing Mexicans look like such - and they don't speak a word in the whole movie.

**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****

In fact, the 'Mexican' girl admits to come from Sacramento at the end of the film, right before she chases Gruner across the desert. This scene and the effects of the atomic explosion make you laugh in desperation after 50 minutes of boring, pointless action.

After seeing this film, I still wonder who had been serving the drops (and why) to Gruner during the fight in the saloon, and if this was supposed to be a prank at all. I can understand the director's acknowledging his father's enduring patience in the credits.

Summarizing: If you have more than average sense of humor and mercy AND your friends are joining in, rent this film. You will enjoy ranting on about it.",1103414400,5,1129,4.487804878048781
7897301,2,630591110X,"There are some great set pieces in this film that make it worth seeing if you're into special effects.  The first is a great dogfight between stealth bombers and an alien spaceship.  Then there are the shoot outs with the  alien and a nuclear explosion.  The film is basically about a team who  defend Earth against an alien species.  Olivier Gruner leads the team and  the excellent Brad Dourif is their commander.  The problem with the film is  that the action comes at the start and end of the film.  The middle 40-50  minutes drag terribly making it an effort to watch in one sitting.  The  dialogue ranges from OK to pretty lame, as does the acting.  Still, Dourif  and Gruner are always watchable and Gruner has a great stunt at the start.  It's a shame, but not a complete waste of time thanks to the effects.",963964800,10,816,4.448979591836735
