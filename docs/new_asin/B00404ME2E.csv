4238784,3,B00404ME2E,"When it comes to Gerry Anderson's classic hits such as ""Thunderbirds"" and ""Space: 1999"", for 40 years, fans have followed every Anderson-related release and in the 1990's, there was a resurgence of interest towards Anderson's work and  in1994-1995, the British sci-fi series ""Space Precinct"" was shown on BBC Two and later syndicated in North America and the SyFy Channel.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Space Precinct 2040"" is presented in 1:33:1.  Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo. Considering the age of this series and it was an older syndicated show from the '90s the truth is a lot of syndicated series form that time does show its age.  Mostly in costume and visual effects which was good for 1994-1995.  So, it all comes down to the viewer and if they mind (or don't mind) the series and costume design.

Some sets with the space craft flying through the city has a ""Thunderbirds"" feel to it.  As for the costume design, in today's standards, some people may have a hard time with the costumes looking like rubberized costumes.  But considering when they were made, I actually thought they looked pretty good back then.  As for picture quality, you can see combing during the action sequences and although not a pristine print, this is probably the best we are going to see of the series for now.

As for audio, audio is clear and understandable.  But if I had one problem is how the aliens similar to humans, have accents.  Especially those who have a New York accents.  But for the most part, the series audio is fine as it is front-channel driven.

There are no subtitles included.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Space Precinct 2040 - The Complete Series"" comes with no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Back in 1994, I used to watch a lot of sci-fi syndication and still watch a little bit of it today.  And when I was younger, I used to tape a lot of the series and figured, one day, I would watch them all over again and see how they would hold up.  For the most part, series such as ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""Babylon 5"" have held up pretty well.

As for ""Space Precinct 2040"", in many ways, watching it today... while some aspects of the series hold up, the series does look its age and also, I can see how the series confused broadcasters as it was shown very late at night (or early morning).  In one hand, scenes with Brogan and his son or his family, you would think that the series has its family time moments.  But then you see aliens getting killed by other aliens and blood splattered on them (of course, watching it today, it doesn't look that grisly.  More like red ketchup on rubberized aliens) or watching Brogan and his wife smooching in the bedroom and seeing the more mature lingo between the two, you realize that the series is not exactly a family sci-fi series.

But still, ""Space Precinct 2040"" had its fun and entertaining moments, especially if you are able to watch it with open eyes and enjoy it for what is.  I liked the concept of humans in other planets, co-existing with aliens and humans and aliens working together to take down criminals.  But although you get a serious actor like Tedd Shackleford starring in a series, then you have some alien extra or character just really demonstrating terrible acting and not-so-well written lines.  As mentioned earlier, aliens speaking with a New York accent?  It just didn't seem right.  But I suppose the bad acting at times could be source for laughter and added to the enjoyment of the series.

As for the DVD, the PQ does show its age and I wish there were special features included.  I would have figured the cast or even Gerry Anderson would be revisited to talk about the series.  Also, I know others love the series passionately but for me, there are other Gerry Anderson series that I enjoyed far more than ""Space Precinct"".

Again, the series may look its age when it comes to visual effects and costume design on a budget but if you're used to kitschy sci-fi series (and I watched everything from ""Space Precinct"" to ""TekWar"", ""TimeTrax"", ""VR.5"" back then) and have a nostalgia to watch older sci-fi series, ""Space Precinct 2040 - The Complete Series"" is for you!",1292284800,55,8317,4.629883481836875
4238785,5,B00404ME2E,"I remember staying up some weekends just to make sure the show was coming on.  It got bounced around the scehdule on one of the independent stations here in New York City.  I did manage to videotape a few episodes.  It's fluffy, with elements of camp but the characters are great and fleshed out which you usually don't get in a show like this.  There are those nice elements here that you have in the tv Alien Nation show with the aliens having completely different anatomical elements that the humans haven't learned yet and of course the aliens eat foods we wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole--which adds to the veracity of the show.  I highly recommend this show and I'm waaay past the age the show was created for--kids.  Adult sci-fi fans will really like it.  I missed the first dvd set they had put out some years back and I'm glad they brought it back again!!!",1291852800,28,870,4.468354430379747
4238786,5,B00404ME2E,"This show is alot of fun and in many ways depicts a future that is a mirror of the problems of the present. With illegal aliens , drug wars, master criminals, and other problems causing problems on the planet of demeter. A planet full of a mix of races including Humans.  The show is not funny to me , but played seriously and lets face it like another reviewer said many of todays crime shows are just as absurd as this space opera is!  Gerry Anderson was the king of  model work so you get lots of cool cities , space stations, and spaceships done with models which is NOT cgi type effects at all but, who cares? it's all about fun here and maintaining a legacy of model work that goes back to the sixties. Shows like UFO , are this ones daddy. Some people spoiled by cgi may not like this one because this is done with models but then they are missing the point of the artistic effort that goes into making one of these shows. We want model work from Anderson , we want to see what they come up with and they deliver here. The characters are not the deepest here but niether are they on alot of cop shows so this should not be a problem for fans of sci fi and cop shows either.  The dvd's look great too. Yes , this is campier than UFO and played that way but it's sure fun and the whole family can enjoy this one.",1291420800,5,1317,4.073359073359073
4238787,5,B00404ME2E,"So Space Precinct was one of those shows I grew up with.  I think I was about five when it first came out, so I can't say I remember a whole lot of the initial series, but I always remembered loving it.  Just over fifteen years later, I finally see it available on DVD and of course had to get it.  Because of the early graphics in the film and TV industry, and the overall advancement of technology at the time, there are parts of the series that appear really dated now (floppy disk drives, 80s and 90s style flying cars, etc.).  That being said, the quality of the program itself was remarkable for the time, and though cheesy, holds a kind of charm that only this show can pull off.  The texturing, makeup and props for many of the futuristic scenes was visionary at the time.  It's an idea that hasn't ever been totally remade in quite the same way ever again.  That's probably why it is so loved.  Not to mention the characters themselves are overall lovable.  It should be a must see for any lover of old sci-fi films and shows.",1291248000,4,1035,4.293814432989691
4238788,5,B00404ME2E,"It's about time! This series, although short, is another splendid work from Gerry Anderson. Career critics will beat it up bad as being junk, but what do they know. Real Sci-Fi fans know a good thing when they see it, and Space Precinct is one show that you just have to see to appreciate. It has that Gerry Anderson flair that only he could pull off. Do yourself a favor and click that ""add to cart"" button now!",1289779200,20,412,4.294871794871795
4238789,5,B00404ME2E,"Space Precinct is a show that inspires me to capslock and squee and flail. It has everything a good cheesy cop show should have: the gruff boss who lets them get away with everything, the ""I heard everything you said"" CPR moments, the waiting by the radio to hear if so-and-so really bought it in that explosion, the car chases, the embarrassing afterschool special-style morals about drugs, the undercover missions that involve very little clothing, or joining a cult, or possibly being BRAINWASHED AND EVIL OH NO! *ahem*

But it's not just a cop show, it's a cop show IN SPACE, and the sci-fi elements are used better than I've ever seen in this genre. The aliens, in particular, actually look alien. There are some of the so-called ""nose aliens"" a la Star Trek, but the main races have their facial features done with puppetry, which makes them fabulously non-human looking while still being fully expressive. (Surprisingly, given the subject matter and the level of cheesiness, Space Precinct rarely descends into Men In Rubber Suits territory.)

And the alien location is used for maximum comedic effect: alien pizzas with horrible toppings delivered by parodic alien delivery guys on flying bikes, alien blind dates with unexpected biology, flying cop cars that look suspiciously like they were lifted from a 1980s US cop show, the bellowing Ethnic Stereotype boss who's neither Irish nor black but instead a googly-eyed alien, godawful intentionlally absurd Future Slang, wacky alien reproductive processes and childrearing techniques...

The main human characters are cops who've transfered from New York to an alien planet known for its tough streets. For the two of them, the show cast genuine Americans with genuine American accents, which was a very good idea. For all of the other characters, including various other people who were supposed to be from New York, it cast locals: Brits and Europeans. Hilariously, this turned out to be an even better idea. The ""Brooklyn"" accent of one old flame who shows up must be heard to be believed! The foreign fascination with, cluelessness about, and humorous critique of American cop shows and American culture as seen on tv is evident throughout.

Though it only lasted a season, Space Precinct doesn't feel unfinished to me. There is a surprising amount of character development for what's primarily a silly, fluffy show. One of the main characters is married, and his wife and children are interesting and well-portrayed. (Don't let the threat of child actors scare you off!) Their Space! Barbecues in their Space! Back Yard are adorable. The other main character carries on an obnoxious but endearing flirtation with a coworker that progresses and is eventually resolved. The female characters are generally fairly three-dimensional despite a certain amount of the sexism that's endemic to old cop shows and sci-fi.

I highly recommend Space Precinct to anyone who likes very campy near-future sci-fi. The show reminds me of Futurama except that nearly everything in Space Precinct is played DEADLY SERIOUS... Which just makes it that much funnier.

(Parents should note that the plots tend to be about people murdering hookers or how alien! crack destroys the lives of the downtrodden in alien! slums. It's certainly absurd, but it's not intended for kids any more than the equally-absurd Miami Vice, Starsky & Hutch, Charlie's Angels, etc. were.)",1284076800,85,3407,5.140794223826715
4238800,5,B00404ME2E,"Disclaimer: I love B-grade movies & cheesy movies.
This is a lot of fun to watch. The acting is OK. The effects are cheesy. The story lines are pretty straightforward, with a few unexpected twists.

4238881,4,B00404ME2E,"I am not much into drama, but that's a better description of this show. It is more of a cop show than sci-fi. It's just in a future where aliens and humans live in the same society. Not bad. Frankly, I think it does a better job of that point than Star Trek.

A lot better than the budget might have allowed. Decent show, if you missed it on TV, I highly recommend it. My father used to watch the show when it was on TV, but I was too busy to bother. I thought I'd catch it in re-runs. HA!

I was able to tell Gerry Anderson before he passed on that he inspired me to delve into science fiction. Now I make money at it, thanks partly to him. I wish I had seen this show before that, so I could have told him how much I loved this show! But, alas, I saw only one on TV, and this on Netflix. So I bought it here when it came out on DVD. Yes, it's so good, I want to watch it over and over, AND shoe=w my friends to get them hooked too!

Do check out all of his stuff. Low budget but they often do a great job.
Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun, Captain Scarlet, Thunderbirds, UFO, Space 1999 to name a few.
This is in the best of Gerry Anderson tradition. Well acted, solid stories, and you soon get into the story and forget that the aliens are just people in costumes with masks on. Not since ""Alien Nation"" have I been so accepting that human actors were aliens. Well done. Gerry. Well done. Thanks again for yet another cool series. I wish it had lasted longer, and he had lived to finish the many projects he told me he was working on at the end of his life.

Knowing nothing about anyone involved, watching it for the first time, I concluded it was directed at a young audience. Not being generally classified as young by other than my 101 year old friend, I did find it too much like a young peoplesd comedy, whatever may have been the producers objective. No way I can evaluate it from thr viewpoint of the young .On the other hand, while having some interest for viewers not in the younger bracket, there is too little on  the adult level, to consider it to be adult programming.

4238933,4,B00404ME2E,"I bought this box set for three reasons: 1. Simone Bendix, irrestistible in or out of uniform 2. Gerry Anderson was the series creator and producer 3. I like science-fiction shows in general. I would have purchased it in Region 2 format (I live in France) but it doesn't seem to exist as such, apart from in wildly expensive single episodes; I don't have a multi-region DVD player but it's not hard to find out on the Internet how to 'dezone' your machine using the remote control so that it will play discs from anywhere in the world. The purchase price was frankly ridiculous compared to many new DVDs that appear on the market and I found delivery to Europe from the USA is quite fast.

Although a Gerry Anderson 'fan' of both puppet and live action shows (Thunderbirds, Space 1999, Captain Scarlet, UFO etc) I had not previously seen 'Space Precinct' and I'm not sure it has ever been on TV here. I didn't really know what to expect as some older sci-fi programmes can show their age and some reviews of this show were mitigated. However, I must say that having almost come to the end, I am really enjoying it. The 'human' actors do not take themselves too seriously and the programme contains quite a little humour. The masks that the 'alien' creatures wear are superb in my view - each is different and allows for eye movement and facial expressions that almost make you forget you are watching 'a man (or woman) in a suit' and the characters have a distinct personality.

Some say the story lines are a little corny, perhaps so but they are entertaining and allow for the car chases and explosions and superb models (such as the robot Slomo) that we associate with other Anderson productions. There is even a little suspense - will Officer Haldane finally get the girl (Officer Castle)? One wonders what on earth (or should I say on Altor) is the man waiting for! It is true that the commercial break 'bumpers' can be somewhat frustrating every few minutes but you get used to them. One regrets no subtitles and no bonus features but the five discs fit nicely in plastic case only 1 times as thick as a normal one. This set is well worth taking the risk - I think you'll probably succumb to its charm (and certainly that of Simone...)",1376870400,3,2241,4.530864197530864

It is far from the usual derivative, bloodthirsty and formulaic schlock that we get in so much Sci Fi. It has character development and interaction and elements of police drama like that in more ""serious"" shows, and uses its settings and situations well for humor. Like many such shows it is written on two levels--one for the kids and one for the adults--so there is something in it for everyone who likes to stretch their imagination. While one or two of the episodes are excessively violent most of the violence is cartoonish and therefore not that harmful for children. Every story seems to have a good moral and human relations lesson which was what we used to have in the television of the 1950s and 1960s.

It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, in fact, I imagine most people denegrate it for being silly and uninpired.  Then again, I am easily entertained.  It isn't Babylon 5, Star Trek, Firefly, Farscape, SG1, etc. (all of which I enjoy as well).  Maybe that's why I find Space Precinct entertaining.  It's different, and doesn't seem to take itself to serious.  It's more like old pulp sci-fi, which, of course, I like.  It's better than watching another modern day cop show on t.v.

4238963,3,B00404ME2E,"Agreeing with reviewers to this point; I'd say the episodes vary between 3 and 4 stars. The writing is high quality, and even minor characters play their roles well. (The stay-at-home-mom is even convincing.) While episodes are more worth watching than, say, most Dr. Who, all Star Trek: Enterprise, and even some of the Babylon 5 of its day, a rough edge is some episodes are targeted toward a young audience, while others parents might not want children to see -- the plots seem to escalate into murder. In one peculiar episode a young girl agonizingly kills several people, one-by-one, but no action is ultimately taken against her -- people say how nice she is! Uh, no, she's a serial murderer! This same kind of illogic has the lead being macho, charging unwisely into situations; that was tolerable ... I just assumed his IQ was 85. Overall, a show any long time sci-fi video buff will want to see.",1318636800,2,904,4.6918238993710695

This is NOT for everyone.  It is for me.  I'm by no means a uber sci-fi geek.  I roll my eyes when my bf mentions Star Trek or Star Wars.  I just don't care.  Space shows, aliens, blah blah blah.  Whatever.  Most sci-fi stuff doesn't interest me at all.  There are a few exceptions to the rule.  I like comedic sci-fi.  I like the cutesy aliens (Yoda)  - hey I said I'm a she, apparently a stereotypical one.  And for some reason I love love love Gerry Anderson stuff.  I'm not sure I'd go so far as to call his shows ""campy"" but they're not overly serious even when they have somewhat serious story lines for the characters in them.  It's not comedic.  It just is.  Simple yet you can tell the people involved really put a lot of heart into it.  They made sure you knew the characters, even some of the aliens (who all looked alike at first) all got very distinct looks as time went on.  The romances are alway cheesy but are not the main stories.

It's not the puppets of the earlier Anderson shows (Supercar, Stingray, Thunderbirds, etc) but it definitely has that feel of an Anderson show.  You know the feel - just a bit in the future with today's technology (well today's or lesser) but hey the vehicles are ahead of us anyway!  In this case as there are actual human actors onscreen and you'll also find some of them get recycled in multiple roles.  Cars that blow up soon at they bump a building just barely but the cop cars can take anything and not get a scratch.

They definitely progressed, even in a one year show.  I had the advantage (or disadvantage) or watching with someone who works with software they used and does some of the types of graphics they did - but today.  At first I was hearing the ""Oh yeah, you can tell this was the first versions of that software and that this was the early 90s"" by the end I was hearing the ""Oh nice"" and the ""there's where the budget went"" or ""I'd love to tell them how much that model impressed me even today"".

So would the dialog or story lines win awards?  Nope, it really is  just  cops in space and sometimes COPS would have better dialog.  But it's fun and it makes you want to keep watching.  And sometimes it's even pretty.",1304985600,9,2418,4.189130434782609
4238966,4,B00404ME2E,"If the name Gerry Anderson means anything to you at all, it's likely the first science fiction work of his to spring to mind would be Space: 1999; a series credited as a cornerstone in setting the science fiction television precedent.  If not for Space: 1999 or UFO, perhaps the name may be familiar to you on account of his mastery of marionettes as witnessed in shows like Stingray or Thunderbirds (""Supermarionation"").

Regardless of whether or not you are familiar with the British publisher, producer, director and writer's works, it turns out that while audiences were swooning to Babylon 5 and Star Trek: Deep Space 9 in the mid 90's, Mr. Anderson was at it again with his own unique science fiction vision in Space Precinct 2040.

Called a blending of space opera and police procedural drama, SP 2040 was the result of lessons and techniques Anderson had acquired along the way and actually earns a spot as one of the highest-budgeted shows he ever produced.  It involved live actors, miniatures, pyrotechnics and perhaps most interestingly, actors wearing complex make-up that included elements of puppetry.  In fact, it is said that several of the production techniques would serve as precursors to the approach used in 1999's Farscape.

The story of Space Precinct takes place in the year 2040 and features Ted Shackelford as former NYPD detective Patrick Brogan, now a lieutenant with the Demeter City police force on the planet Altor in the Epsilon Erandi system and his partner Jack Haldane (played by Rob Youngblood).

They, with a host of other interstellar officers, are out to protect the law-abiding citizens of Demeter City; a rough neighborhood rife with planetary felons, galactic gangs and alien extortionists.

If all of this sounds a little odd to you, oh rest assured, it is! However, it only takes an episode or two before the uniquely British feel of the production begins to grow on you (even if the actors clearly went the extra kilometer to master NY City accents).

Pacing is pretty darn perfect with each episode building a pretty interesting criminal case for our heroes to solve; sort of a CSI: Demeter long before such things were fashionable.

Now the all-important question- how do the effects hold up today?  Actually they are far better than expected thanks in no small part to the fact that all of the designs were practical (rather than CGI).  A few set exteriors and some of the miniatures have an unmistakably prop-like feel to them but the fact that the actors were always interacting with tangible cohorts (be they puppets, costumes or both), there is certainly a sense of realism lacking in today's animation-heavy way of doing things.

Sadly the show only ran a single season (24-episodes) in syndication between 1994-95.  The reason for the lack of staying power may actually come as a surprise to some though, apparently American broadcasters were quite uncertain at the time what to make of this imported series that, because of bright costumes, robots and so on looked on the surface to be aimed at children, yet actually featured adult-oriented storylines and science fiction gore. As a result, here in the States SP: 2040 was often scheduled in late-night/early morning time slots. Because of this it failed to generate sufficient American ratings for a second season to be authorized.

After years of being in ""out of print"" status globally and US releases relegated to a few ancient VHS tapes, the powers that be finally deemed Space Precinct: 2040 worthy of a full DVD box set in late 2010.  Rather like greasy food, riding a moped, or calling your ex at 2:30am after a weekend bender, Space Precinct: 2040 is one of life's simple pleasures that you may deny when your friends start asking questions.",1304899200,11,3757,4.920886075949367

I do remember Gerry Anderson, the producer.  He made the famous Thunderbirds,Space 1999 and Captain Scarlet.  I would have to reccomend this show to any fan of the genre. While far from perfect, it was one of the better ones that had good values.  If it wasn't for Ted, I don't think I'd even watch the show.  He does have a striking resemblence to Space:1999 actor, Nick Tate!
