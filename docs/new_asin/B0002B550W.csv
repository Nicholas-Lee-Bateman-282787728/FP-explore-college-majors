8025574,5,B0002B550W,"I love to watch old shows, and see how comediennes have grown over the years - this show stars a young, witty, very intelligent Betty White, in a format
unusual for today.  To me, watching some of these great old shows is like watching part of our history unfold!  It appears that the cast had a lot of fun in making
this show also, they seem to have really clicked and enjoyed themselves.",1264896000,2,389,4.315068493150685
8025575,4,B0002B550W,"Light-hearted and cute, This 50's sitcom stars the talented Betty White, and is quite amusing. This DVD contains 4 episodes consisting of 3 segments each, and the picture & sound quality is quite good for a 50's sitcom. I agree with reviewer Byron Kolln, if you like this you should check out ""Meet Corliss Archer"", which stars Ann Baker, and has that same early 50's charm.",1215993600,,374,4.681818181818182
8025576,4,B0002B550W,"LIFE WITH ELIZABETH was a charming sitcom produced by/starring Betty White in the title role.  White was one of the female pioneers in the early days of the television industry, rivalling Lucille Ball.  LIFE WITH ELIZABETH was a big hit, earned White many accolades including an Emmy Award, and paved the way for a string of popular sitcom characters like Sue Ann Nivens in ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", Ellen Jackson in ""Mama's Family"" and of course Rose Nylund in ""The Golden Girls"".  White also starred in the short-lived ""Betty White Show"" in 1977.

Unlike the format of normal sitcoms, LWE did not feature a single narrative, rather several 'incidents' (sort of ""A Day in the Life of Elizabeth""), hosted and narrated by Jack Narz.  Betty White glows as Elizabeth with fine support from Del Moore as patient husband Alvin.  LIFE WITH ELIZABETH ran for three years in syndication.  Simple, homely domestic comedy.

This disc from Alpha presents 4 classic episodes:

1) Elizabeth tries to convince Alvin to plant an oak tree in their yard; Elizabeth and Alvin attempt to fix their broken television set; and the pair must contend with the world's weirdest waitress when they decide to have dinner at a Drive-In.

2) Elizabeth is swept off her feet by an old army buddy of Alvin's; Elizabeth and Alvin decide to spend the day hanging up new curtains.

3) Elizabeth takes Alvin on a whirlwind shopping trip; and whilst expecting the taxman, Elizabeth opens up her home to a thief.

4) Elizabeth's mother is coming to stay, but she decides to keep it a secret from Alvin; the pair decide to go on a biking picnic; and nosey neighbour Chlorine Skinridge (Lois Bridge) disrupts an entire day for Elizabeth.

If you like this show, then I also recommend ""Meet Corliss Archer"".  Alpha has released a couple of volumes from that show, too.",1140652800,15,1832,4.792993630573249
