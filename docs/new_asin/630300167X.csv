7835757,3,630300167X,"I am a fan of good movies especially involving crime and infidelity. The successful female lead's husband is a college professor who lost his attempt to get tenure and now is a sour puss, supposedly without any
desire for love or sex. All her attempts to get affection are spurred because he has a class or is tired. On suggestion of a best friend, she and others visit a male strip joint. When the eyes of a sexy male stripper come in contact with hers, one can feel the spark miles away.
Despite her desires not to cheat, his charm leads her into love making and experiencing life again. And they start an affair with very regular interludes.  Her friend, finding out that she is falling in love tries to discourage the affair. But, there is a set-up.  The stripper sends pictures of her and a lady making love, in an attempt for ransom. After confessing her sins to the husband, they get it on good again. But then the stripper is found murdered. Her prints are on the gun. She was seen
at the crime scene. All along, the professor is seen walking with a sexy blonde college student.  She is arrested for murder. A loyal detective
friend seeks the truth.  The ending shows betrayal as well as a cuckhold husband finding ""it"" elsewhere.  This is a good film.  I just wasn't turned on by the sex-bored professor and his deceptive antics. At the same time one can feel her need for fulfillment, even with a greaser.
Some rate this as 4****. Compared to others, I can go 3 1/2***. Better than freezing on a cold night. But don't expect this movie to lead to
spur your own romance. Enjoy it and then talk over coffee.",1203120000,,1615,4.420875420875421
7835758,2,630300167X,"Face it, these kind of movies exist only for the sex and nudity, so what on earth possesses the idiots who put such films on DVD to cut out the original sex and nude scenes? It's like cutting Godzilla out of a Godzilla movie.  What's left? A hot video becomes a boring DVD because these morons think they can improve the original movie by slicing out most of what the viewers want to see. (They did the same thing with ""Secret Games"" and many other sexy videos when they came out on DVD.) What a waste. Get the video, or wait until these jackasses wake up and release the original uncut version on DVD.",1134172800,21,602,4.280701754385965
7835759,3,630300167X,"One expects the typical Hollywild flesh in B movies of this type, but I also expect a movie with Edward Albert in it to exude the charisma which his characters usually project in carrying a movie.

With that I was disappointed in he played a droll person locked in a book. Diana Barton looked in the entire movie like a sparkling bubble just waiting to extoll the champaign of her talent, but was never uncorked.

The director who wrote this appears to have lifted the story from cheap online erotica, but failed time and again to deliver as scenes jumped from one sexcapade to the other. He forgot the tease.

Patrick Swayze was wasted in a bit part and all I could think was in watching Chad McQueen was how he was nothing like another McQueen, Steve.

This movie could have been a spectacular erotic thriller, but the characters never had the opportunity to develope, which is the directors fault.

3 stars because Diana Barton is more beautiful clothed than undressed.",1117756800,2,972,4.6608187134502925
7835760,3,630300167X,"I love the story of deseption of a married couple and why they theat on each other in this movie.
 Because!  It shows us a lesson on what can happen when married couple's don't fallow the rules.",1102723200,,194,4.216216216216216
7835761,5,630300167X,"I'm one of Diana Barton 's biggest fan so I had to own this movie. It's been a good surprise. ""Sexual Malice"" is so sensual. Diana is both a great actress and a magnificent lady. Some scenes are just hot, especially the beach one. The cinematogrphy is amazing and Diana' s performance is really impressive.",990921600,5,306,4.581818181818182
7835762,3,630300167X,"Intrigue and double dealing in the corporate world of advertising is the backdrop for this so so would be erotic flick. As for the erotic content, there's some but could have been more. The lead bad guy is John Loughlin (remember him, the DIY sleuth from the 1985 Ken Russell flick 'Crimes of Passion'? with Kathleen Turner). Not a bad actor at all but never really recognised. Kathy Shower, Playboy's Playmate of the year 1986 is here to co-starring as his long suffering...wife.
You could do worse than watch this film but all in all it's an assemble yourself by the numbers story which you hve to work with to enjoy. Loughlin woos female assistant then dumps her. She commits suicide but her long lost sister investigates Loughlin for purpose of revenge.
I've seen worse. highlight is Kathy Shower's love scene with Loughlin.",976752000,2,828,4.7972027972027975
7835763,5,630300167X,"I saw this movie years ago and was instantly impressed for many reasons. First of all, the cinematography is excellent - really showcasing the beauty of actress Diana Barton. The plot is full of twists and the movie is  very fast-paced, packed full of original and interesting sex scenes. This  is a great video to watch by the fire with a bottle of wine and a lover.  Buy it!",963792000,7,376,4.420289855072464
