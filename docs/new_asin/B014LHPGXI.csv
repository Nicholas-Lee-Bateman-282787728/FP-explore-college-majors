8731333,5,B014LHPGXI,"I remember seeing my first Jacques Rivette film in the small theater space of the WALKER ART CENTER in Minneapolis. The room was packed with out 300 viewers. When the film ended some four hours later, there were only a handful of us left. But I was very pleased and enlightened by what I saw. OUT-1 is, of course much, much longer, but it moves in the same way - slowly, stately, following the rhythms of daily life for these artists even as they explore alternatives to hum-drum and routine. I know two other films by Rivette, and all three films plunge the characters into an ambiguous world threatened by mysterious forces or cabals, so there is peril in the background and confusion in the foreground. The characters do not learn the whole truth nor do they surmount the broken world  in which they are confined. All of these films portray the existential crisis of modernity, at the core of which is an irreducible absurdity. The characters are anti-heroes but I sensed traces of the ancient hero in their resilience, courage, refusal to give up the the quest they set for themselves to realize some vision of a more honest and fulfilling life-style. To call this film the HOLY GRAIL OF FRENCH CINEMA may refer to more than its rarity and purity of artistic intention. It may indeed be a version of the Quest for whatever replaces the medieval Grail in our modern age.  But there are neither villains nor heroes  in the conventional sense. These are committed artists manuevering as best they can in an existential Wasteland, seeking to impose what meaning is available to them on the ambiguities of personality and experience. Don't expect happiness and success in the end;  don't expect anything. rather live, like Camus, a life worth living, between hope and despair, and say with Camus: I SURRENDERED NOTHING OF MYSELF, AND DON NO MASK: LEARNING PATIENTLY AND ARDUOUSLY HOW TO LIVE IS ENOUGH FOR ME. That to me sums up the moral purpose of OUT-1.",1497139200,3,1955,4.724340175953079

8731337,5,B014LHPGXI,"Shooting in 16 mm in the late 60s-the norm in the TV industry-was an attempt to take film closer to the Real, which Rivette and Godard were doing. In Lamour fou(1969) Rivette 16 mm represents the footage shot by a TV crew documenting the rehearsal process where a group of actors rehearse Shakespeares Pericles. In Out1 the 16 mm format was not a tool designed to document the work of the actors, but was dictated by the mode of production of the film, commissioned in serial form by French state TV, but when the executives saw the 8-episode, 743 minutes of the finished product, they rejected it. Rivette edited a 255 minute version of the film, Out 1 :Spectre, which had a modest commercial run. The original version, Out 1 : Noli me tangere became almost invisible, apart from a screening in Le Havre in 1971. Rivette used theatre rehearsals as a structuring device, as in his breakthrough film Paris nous appartient ( 1961)-as much a paranoid portrait of Paris in its time as Out1 had been 10 years later. But he became embarrassed by conventional scripting and made the more free form,unscripted Lamour fou, this opened up his work to improvisation and greater length,with a bare bones scenario. Rivette shot Out 1 after the collapse of the social uprising of May 1968,when a series of strikes by Parisian student unions resulted in a full blown confrontation with the military. The radical hope to change a conservative society ended meekly with De Gaulles party consolidating power. Out 1 taps into this post-68 amalgam of malaise, disillusionment and distrust in grand social movements.

Paris is turned into disconnected individual groups hermetically sealed off from each other. In Out 1 he wrote an outline blueprint to get funding, but allowed the actors their heads in having them improvise after having chosen their characters themselves. There are two theatre groups rehearsing two Greek plays, 7 Against Thebes and Prometheus Bound, which provide a backbone- a defiance against authority- around which the other diffracted narratives gravitate. One troupe headed byThomas(Michael Lonsdale) who leads his group through a series of psychosomatic exercises(breathing, improvising,touching,exploring, free-associating about different versions of the text), the other headed by Lili( Michele Moretti) more interested in forms of choral practice and dance, both attempting to recreate the unselfconscious play of children. We later understand they formerly lived together but split up due to differences of method. Thomas appears in the course of the film as both mastermind and victim of his alternate lifestyle,alternating between several women, dressing down in slacks, T-shirts and Afghan jackets as a bohemian,yet associating with friends from the upper crust( businessmen,lawyers etc.) with whom he may be involved in another game-the hidden plot inspired by Balzacs Histoire des Trieze in which 13 individuals form a secret society to achieve power. Yet he has a spectacular breakdown late in the film,when internal strife within the group forces him to give up the production of Prometheus,when he seeks shelter in a sea-side house owned by a group of friends. He lies in the sand crying and laughing, giving an uninhibited improvised performance. Something of the Real is captured in the most artificial sequences of all-rehearsals in enclosed space, where through improvisation the actors are asked to enact their fantasies. The rehearsal scenes are filmed in extremely long shots, capturing facial expressions,drops of sweat, body movements of the actors.

For Rivette, narrative cinema is a documentary on the actors. These groups are bonded by ideals of communal togetherness. Intersecting with the lives of the theatre groups and their elusive 13 friends( do they exist or not or are they vaguer groupings?) are two perfect outsiders existing in the margins, Colin( Jean-Pierre Leaud) and Frederique( Juliet Berto). Colin panhandles in cafes pretending to be a deaf mute, Frederique uses cons to obtain or steal money( or valuable letters) from men. If all the characters are lost these are adrift and loners. Colin is a detective of signs of the secret 13. This leads him to The Corner of Chance a boutique run by Pauline(Bulle Ogier) with whom he falls madly in love. But she has another life and maybe a member of the 13 with a different name, has children, lives in a big house with a nanny and a mysterious husband she never sees. There are class differences. There are moments of high comedy in the pranks and pratfalls of these grifters. Frederique bumps into Renaud, an outsider who stole a lottery win from Lilis group after pretending to be one of them,leading to its dissolution, and they get together briefly and tragically. The two outsiders attempts to get to know the nature of the conspiracy ultimately fail. The Balzacian plot was a MacGuffin, a childs fantasy, a game in which to get caught up. The conspiracy they're all involved in may be their own creation, their projection of an oppressive regime thats all powerful and all knowing, maybe its all them, they're looking for something to battle against. This is a total immersion in an experience. What youll certainly take away from this film is the idea of the long take lasting 13 minutes, amazing live street sequences, graffiti and posters, the bohemian modes of dress, a memoir of a time when politics was mainly about philosophy, the way myths are used to understand reality, and the Noli me tangere theme, the elusiveness of the Real, you get so sucked into this Promethean vat of inspiration and all its characters that perfectly captures a time and place forever. Like Prousts A La Recherche we dip into the sensibility and hang the sense. Rivette lives .This led on to Celine and Julie go boating.",1453766400,21,5804,5.082809224318658

I chose to go with this one over the Arrow Video release because I liked the artwork better, even though the Arrow one comes with two extra films.
