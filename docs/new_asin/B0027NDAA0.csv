8354916,5,B0027NDAA0,I had Bob's tape in bata format years ago. Really like his approach to stretching. Glad to have it in my collection again.,1461542400,,122,4.3478260869565215
8354917,4,B0027NDAA0,These are vastly underrated.  Also check out his golf video!,1431648000,2,60,5.0
8354918,5,B0027NDAA0,"I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about. I've had years of martial arts and the exercises on this DVD are the basics.
There's seems to be a current trend in infomercials and workout DVD's where using your own body are the in demand workouts.
The Instant Karate section of this DVD provides such a workout.
And you just might pick up and hone some basic martial arts skills.
Better to know one way to block a punch and use it if you have to than to get clobbered while you're trying to decide which one of the 20 tecniques you've learned you're going to use.",1355356800,2,571,4.296296296296297
8354919,1,B0027NDAA0,"This DVD does NOT teach the correct or safe basics of karate, aerobic exercising or stretching!  This was produced in 1983 and, even for the '80s, it's terrible.  I had hoped this DVD would help me remember the correct techniques when I practiced karate at home, while taking my very first karate class.  If you follow the techniques in this DVD you should be prepared to experience back pain, tendonitis, shoulder strain, etc.  You will NOT learn karate!  You won't even have purchased a decent exercise DVD.",1266710400,5,509,4.804597701149425
