6389927,5,B00JU27CRI,"Great DVD and Father McGivney and praying that Blessed Michael McGivney will soon be raised to ""Sainthood.""  Superb service..",1404691200,3,125,5.578947368421052
6389928,4,B00JU27CRI,"It was a good overview of his life and accomplishments especially his development of the Knights of Columbus. Unfortunately it only gave a couple of glimpses into the spiritual life behind them.  He could have been just a very good untiring social worker based on what was presented here. No presentation of his spiritual life  or wisdom or his priestly sanctity (unless you read into it based on previous knowledge). But if you already know about these, it is a good overview.",1404000000,,477,4.804878048780488
6389929,5,B00JU27CRI,I thought this dvd did a fantastic job telling the story of Father Michael McGivney. The reenactments really helped paint a picture of the struggles and triumphs that he faced throughout his journey.,1403481600,,199,5.0606060606060606
6389930,4,B00JU27CRI,This was a great documentary. The reenactment scenes were amazing. Excellent job with casting the lead role for Michael McGivney. Great insight into the founder of the Knights of Columbus.,1403481600,,188,5.3
6389931,4,B00JU27CRI,"I purchased this for a presentation, not quite what I was looking for but good information on the Life of this Priest who is on the path to Sainthood",1403481600,,149,4.172413793103448
6389932,5,B00JU27CRI,"This is a very well done documentary that has a broader appeal beyond members of the Knights of Columbus. Fr. McGivney's life and witness resonate with anyone who has struggled with adversity in life. Born of a poor immigrant family this heroic figure overcame poverty, the death of his father and numerous siblings, anti-Catholic persecution and social injustice. His legacy is not just the still thriving Knights of Columbus--the world's largest Catholic fraternal organization--it is the power of an individual to transform his local community and entire nation through commitment to moral truths and the dignity of the human person. I think viewers will come away from this film not only hoping he is soon canonized (apparently it is being considered by the Vatican) but also inspired to try and follow his lead in combating social injustice and defending the poor and marginalized.",1402444800,5,886,5.2027972027972025

6389941,5,B00JU27CRI,"This story is about a parish priest who walked his talk and who truly tried to better the lot of his people.  He is a man who truly cared about his people.  He founded the Knights of Columbus in order to prevent women and children from being destitute if their husbands were killed, a common problem in the work-force at that time.  He died at young age but left a tremendous legacy.",1419638400,,383,4.291666666666667

6389943,5,B00JU27CRI,"My title might seem a bit odd. Having joined the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal men's service organization, I was interested in this documentary about its founder. I had read the book Parish Priest about Father Michael McGivney, but that doesn't mention Knights until 200 pages in, and I thought this DVD might be a bit more to the point. But in a certain sense it's not, because Father McGivney did so much more than that, and most of it before founding Knights. This documentary runs almost an hour, but it seems a lot longer, having no commercials. Other than that, it's like a History Channel TV show. There's running narration, and brief interview bits, but most of it is a dramatic reconstruction of 19th century life, with a huge cast. For this reason, it's quite engaging and gripping.

This video dates from 2008, although the packaging of this edition is from 2014. I bought it in a Catholic book store for the same price Amazon has it for, as I write. Amazon may lower it at some point, of course. It seems like it was shown on TV because it starts with a teaser about Father McGivney's cause for Sainthood (which won't interest non-Catholics), and the narrator does a lot of foreshadowing as if approaching a commercial break. But on the video, the story is seamless. You could watch this as an interesting documentary about the plight of immigrants in the 19th century, particularly Irish immigrants, or about the related topic of the state of the Catholic Church in New England at that time. Or as a history of the Knights. There are no extras on the DVD, but you can select between four languages: English, Spanish, French, and Polish.

About a million immigrants fled the potato famine in Ireland, mostly to the eastern US. This got them even more hated than they already were, and Catholics viewed with even more suspicion. Two things happened around then in the 19th century in the US. A lot of religious movements were started, and a lot of secret societies began. Sometimes the two were related. It's no accident that nearly all of the US presidents were Masons, and sometimes you had to join a society like that to get a good job. Immigrants, especially Irish ones, worked at hard, dangerous jobs, and the breadwinning father often died young. There was no universally available insurance. Masons, for example, were also an insurance, known as a death benefits, group, for their members. Knights was started for two main reasons. First, to provide an organization that was not a secret society for men that would affirm Catholic values, and second, to provide for widows and children. Thus it is that Knights still offers insurance today.

Knights sometimes gets a bad rap today as a drinking club, or an organization with its own agenda that doesn't support the priest or pope. Every stereotype might be true in some cases, but where Knights councils follow their founder's vision, the members can provide greatly needed support and assistance to the priest, the pope, the parish, the wider Church, and the community. If anything would make a man want to join the Knights, it's this video, which shows how he takes his place in a great legacy, and why Knights are proud to regard Father McGivney as the Father of us all. Only one thing about it is misleading. For a man said to be always laughing and smiling, in his portraits he looks somber and sad. This is because of the 19th century view that you ought to look dignified in a portrait. It's the same way with Chesterton's portraits from the same time.  (Note: parents should watch this video first before showing it to their kids, as it shows a man being hanged).",1417132800,3,3651,4.717868338557993

Although it has been some time since I read ""Parish Priest"" about Fr. McGivney, I believe this video attempts to put the visuals to the book.  The book was better, but the video is worth viewing to reinforce the contributions that the Knights made and are still making to the Church and to the world.  This video will further enhance the awareness of Fr. McGivney as his cause for sainthood is advanced.",1409270400,2,592,4.514018691588785
