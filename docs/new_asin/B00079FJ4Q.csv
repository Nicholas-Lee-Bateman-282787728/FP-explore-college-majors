8046205,5,B00079FJ4Q,One of my all time favorites!  Beautifully performed classics illustrationed magnificently.  This is a music appreciation class for all ages.  I want more and on DVD please.,1473379200,,173,5.333333333333333
8046206,5,B00079FJ4Q,"This video has great songs (catchy but not the usual run-of-the-mill,) great  performers, and the animation is clever and creative, beautiful but somehow childlike, and varied depending on the song. I had forgotten about it (my son is now 14!) until a friend to whom I gave it phoned, wondering what it was called so she could give it to another friend who has a baby. We both remember this as the BEST video--calming, fun, not annoying--just great.",1284681600,,449,4.756410256410256
8046207,5,B00079FJ4Q,This VCR movie is the best!  I had bought one thru Children's Book of the Month Club when my first granddaughter was 1 (8 years ago).  She loved it and would watch it over and over.  I wanted another tape for my grandson to watch at my house (he just turned 2).  He will stand and watch it again and again and sing the songs with the movie.  The songs are catchy and cute with adorable illustrations to go with the music.  Johnny Cash sings one of the songs.  It will have you singing the songs yourself thru the day.  I HIGHLY recommend this tape to anyone who has a child...my 9 year granddaughter still likes to hear the music. I just wish it came in a DVD.,1276387200,,660,4.1015625
8046208,5,B00079FJ4Q,"This is by far our favorite animated video for kids. Johnny Cash doing Bling-Blang? What more need be said. Oh, well I guess I should point out that the animated treatments are all strokes of pure genius. That might be nice to know.

Somebody, anybody release these animations in DVD format, so we don't have to resort to copying to digital.",1226016000,2,341,4.590163934426229
8046209,5,B00079FJ4Q,This is the best childrens video we have ever bought.........Our VHS tape has worn out and we would hope that it will become available on DVD.  DVD PLEASE!,1143072000,3,155,4.535714285714286
8046210,5,B00079FJ4Q,"This was our children's first video and our all-time favorite.  The beautiful, whimsical images and gentle music captivated the entire family again and again.  The animation and musical style are very unique.  Great for inducing ""warm and fuzzy"" feelings. The songs, some familiar stand-bys and some new, became a part of our family repertoire.  Unfortunately, the video wore out in a short time - that's why we looked for it here.  But $40 for a VHS video?  Let's be real.  I hope somebody makes this on DVD.",1107907200,4,509,4.781609195402299
