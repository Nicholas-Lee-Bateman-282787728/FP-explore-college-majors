5778167,2,B00D920HT0,"I love Danielle Harris but this movie just went nowhere fast. It took forever to finally get to the point and the acting was horrendous. The ending was the worst. Don't waste your time with this movie, better luck next time Danielle.",1383955200,,233,4.571428571428571
5778168,1,B00D920HT0,"This I thought was a dumb movie but if you like gory it is here! The quality of the movie was poor so when I reported it to Amazon they refunded my $3.99. Amazon is so good about this! The movie is about this Psychologist that invites her so called friends over to her house for dinner and she took movies of everyone to see if they really knew each other as well as they thought they did. Surprise! They didn't!
But as I said before I could not follow it as it kept stopping and starting. Didn't think I would ever make it to the end because of that. Perhaps you will have a better experience.",1381622400,,594,4.085470085470085
5778169,3,B00D920HT0,"Frankly it' s not a masterpiece, but for a first movie it's not so bad. Danielle Harris is a great scream queen, and with a little more work a good director. And so it's always a pleasure to see her friends, Kane Hodder, Mickael Bieh, Xavier Gens & co.",1379980800,6,252,4.163265306122449
5778170,3,B00D920HT0,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

Firstly, Amazon needs to correct something in the details of their rental page; this doesn't star Danielle Harris. Danielle directed it and she has a small cameo in it, but she doesn't star in it. Had she starred in this, I would have most likely found it more enjoyable since I like her work.

Secondly, the movie itself. I think Danielle did a fine job directing this one, but the writing of it (done by Alyssa Lobit who also play Bernadette) fell short. The characters (aside from possibly Lily and Sara) either weren't likable or we weren't given enough time to like them. Therefore, I really could have cared less when it came time for them to pay the piper for the sins they had committed. Speaking of the sins that had been committed; I only found one of them to be punishable by way of torture. Maybe that's just me and I'm missing the sadistic streak of wanting to cause severe and permanent bodily harm to someone for committing the act of voyeurism and/or cheating.

I will say that I was left wondering if this was to be ""for real"" or if it was going to pay homage to April Fool's Day (1986). In that respect, it was suspenseful. The acting wasn't bad either. But honestly, I've seen better films and was disappointed by this one.",1379203200,2,1264,4.48695652173913

Among Friends is the directorial debut of horror queen Danielle Harris. It would appear to be, on the surface, a similar hash of the tired torture horror that has been overdone since the endless Saw sequels and Hostel ripoffs but it actually brings some fresh air to the subject. The story revolves around a group of 6 friends who have come to a 80's themed party hosted by their friend Bernadette. They are drugged by one of the group and forced to see their sins displayed and they have to answer for them. You see them violate the trusts of others and they violate each other to the deepest core. Before the night is over none of them will ever be the same if they can make it through the night. Ms. Harris called in all of her friends to help with this one and you can see she has a very talented group of friends. Standout performances from Alyssa Lobit, AJ Bowen, and Brianne Davis. Abley supported by Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, Christopher Backus, Kamala Jones, Chris Meyer, Dana Daurey, and Kane Hodder as the limo driver. There are a host of cameos including Ms. Harris in a certain costume she made famous. This is great start for Danielle Harris and I can only hope she make her next film as entertaining as this one.",1378771200,13,1268,4.565789473684211
5778172,3,B00D920HT0,"Although I watched this film & it held a grip on my reality until the end, I'm still unsure why Bernie was hell-bent on pointing out her friends shortcomings (Exception rapiest - that is not a shortcoming & I'm not taking that lightly). Considering the transgressions of Bernie's friends and their serious character flaws, I'm still missing something - Did I miss the part or can someone tell me, who made Bernie God?  I'm deliberately calling her Bernie because she hates it so....and I think she deserves it!  If I'm not mistaken, I've seen a movie with the same story line (removal of body parts at a dinner party).  There could have even been a couple made, both of which made more sense than this one.....not a good showing.",1378080000,,729,4.635658914728682

5778196,3,B00D920HT0,"Bernadette (Alyssa Lobit) a psychologist throws a party for a group of friends, a theme party where they have to solve a murder. The movie becomes one of those everyone sitting around a table, secrets being revealed, and people being tortured type film. This one attempts to ""go deep"" by turning ""inaction"" into a horrible deed deserving punishment, although I think ""Seinfeld"" did it better.

With the exception of Jules (Brianne Davis) on mushrooms, the film was a bit boring as we watched films of wrong doings etc. This type of film works better as a forced game or a brutal ""truth or dare.""

Makes for a decent rental. Not on my keeper list.

What I do remember:  **Spoiler** There are some sex scenes that are graphic, and probably unnecessary but it still was a good movie.",1408579200,,297,4.285714285714286

If you like torture-horror (which, normally, I don't) this is very fun. Awesome costumes, too! And hey, if I seem a little flippant about scalping and castration, just a reminder, it's FAKE.",1406505600,,316,4.87037037037037
5778204,2,B00D920HT0,It's not completely awful except for the weak story and the fact that there is no third act whatsoever. It was weird seeing the random cameos of Michael Biehn and Danielle Harris but I guess that was artistic use of the most notable people involved in the project. I thought the acting was fine. The lighting was good and the cinematography was very decent. The story was just really kinda weak but good job Danielle on her first directing experience! I wouldn't watch it again or tell anyone else they have to see it but it wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen either.,1405036800,,570,4.490384615384615
5778205,4,B00D920HT0,"With its smarmy, campy over-the-top-in-all-departments verve, Among Friends feels more like the movie Clue (ah, Clue, Leslie Ann Warren, Martin Mull, Christopher Lloyd, Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn...sigh, where have they all gone?) than it does of its torture-porn-as-sick-game siblings, Die and Would You Rather... And Jennifer Blanc is a ringer for Jennifer Anniston. Uncanny! Love the way Alyssa Lobit as sociopath Bernadette keeps cracking her neck, love the way the film starts with Polaroids of all the  key actors (except one) dressing up in gaudy formal, and it's only a few minutes in that you realize that they're going to an 80s-theme whodunit murder mystery party, the kind I avoid at all costs. And glad I do because Bernadette is pretty merciless when it comes to reckoning. It's a little odd that the sins she punishes in a pretty much equal way range from furtive masturbation to downright rape...and then the two minute homily about the ""epidemic"" of ""bystander apathy"", while noble, felt like it had been cribbed from a social worker's favorite brochure. But don't let that detract from the fun, or you might tune out before actress Dana Daurey appears all of a sudden as Lily, who we all forgot about. At least I did! Very nice touch, and Daurey is a comic gem! And cute to boot! Where did she come from? Wait, I know, heaven.",1404086400,,1342,4.860262008733624
5778226,5,B00D920HT0,"I had the pleasure of first hearing about this movie 2 years ago from Danielle Harris herself when I met her at Horror Hound Weekend Columbus. This film is a pretty damned good directorial debut from Ms. Harris. Granted, it could have been a bit better storyline wise, as it seemed a bit week in some areas, but considering this was her first time as a director, she does show a lot of potential for future directorial efforts! I definitely recommend picking this one up for your collection, especially if you're a fan of Danielle Harris or Kane Hodder, who has a cameo as a limo driver at the start of the film.",1401408000,,612,4.424778761061947

5778228,4,B00D920HT0,"Another take on a dinner party gone weird. But the storyline is executed differently with an unusual crowd. I've seen it more than once. A movie has to be interesting for more than one viewing. All the actors are true to their roles and tension steadily builds. Great indie.

5778229,3,B00D920HT0,"Not bad,this debut-feature from DANIELLE HARRIS.The Stars acting well.
BUT the story is very thin. I saw some movies with this kind of story,who work much better!

5778231,2,B00D920HT0,"Let me say that I really, really did not like this movie. The beginning was your typical wild-partying-getting-to-know-ya mess that's required of most horror movies. Once the film reached the start of ""the game"" and the instructions were given out by the Bernadette character, I was thinking maybe the movie took a turn for the better.  Maybe it was starting to get juicy.  But then, crash & burn all over again with more disappointment. Everything the friends were being punished for turned out to be sexual in nature...and boy, did they play some raunchy little video clips to prove it. I've seen about a billion horror movies in my lifetime so believe me when I say that I always expect some sex scenes, but I literally heard the word ""cum"" in this movie about 10 times. Sounded like a porn for a few minutes, so just a tad overboard if you ask me.  I was also disappointed when the lesbian character hallucinated that she was starring in a movie...it seemed to drag on for 15 minutes! And did Danielle Harris REALLY need to make an appearance & remind us all that she is in fact the girl from the Halloween movies?! Totally unnecessary, and I felt it made the film feel a little TOO campy. Towards the end of the movie it became obvious that scenes were being stretched out to help fill up an obviously lackluster script.  The climax left me with too many unanswered questions - I ended up feeling like I had just watched an 80 minute trailer instead of finishing the entire movie. Overall, I gave it 2 stars for the 20 minutes in the middle that I enjoyed and for the always appreciated presence of AJ Bowen :)",1389744000,3,1615,4.501706484641638
5778232,2,B00D920HT0,"I love horror movies and I love Danielle Harris but this was so crap. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because it was Danielle's directional debut and I do hope she does more and grows from this flop. It was kind of cool that she just got a bunch of friends together for it and it does look like they had fun. Also for a low budget it doesnt look too bad, but it still doesn't cut it in my book.",1388620800,2,397,3.7951807228915664

5778234,3,B00D920HT0,"I'm really sorry to Danielle Harris, I love her but this movie is not that good.  In fact it's pretty dumb, had some okay scenes and a decent premiss but it just didn't deliver on the shocks.  It's just not really thrilling, kinda boring and only good for a one time watch, if that.  I can't recommend this.  The only reason I gave it three stars is because it had some good special effects for the torture scenes.",1386720000,3,414,4.269230769230769
5778235,3,B00D920HT0,"This is not your typical horror movie. It is a low budget production, so don't expect too much. It is a bit warped as well. Reminds me a bit of what Bobcat Goldthwait would direct.
The story is straightforward. The hostess is making her point and punishing her hypocritical 'friends.' It's somewhat gory by today's standards and it's just interesting enough that you have to see how it ends.
Good enough to pass the time and a one-time viewing; not good enough to own a copy.

8590739,2,B00D920HT0,I can't really say anything good about this but I've seen far worse in the horror genre. It was kind of cool to see Kane Hodder but you realize rather quickly why Kane isn't usually in a speaking part. If this was on YouTube as an amateur's first film then I'd say there was some promise there but this isn't new to anyone here so I'd say pass.,1524268800,,344,4.073529411764706
8590740,1,B00D920HT0,"Terrible. Not entertaining, not funny, not scary or shocking or original in any way. Atrocious acting, especially from the ""Host"" of the party. I hope I never have to see that girl in anything ever again.",1508803200,,204,4.694444444444445

8590742,2,B00D920HT0,"I wasn't really impressed with this flick. The story really doesn't make much sense, the script is poor, some of the directing choices are strange and most of the acting is really bad. I found it hard to care about any of the characters (including the ""killer"") because their actions aren't really explained very well. Everyone is very one dimensional and the way these people react to certain situations isn't very believable.

The whole movie is a kind of a bore and I found my attention span drifting which isn't a good thing considering how short the movie is.

The setup is good but the movie really doesn't go anywhere and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. There is also a post credits scene that is less than satisfying and provides even more disappointment on top of the lackluster ending.

On the plus side, the movie doesn't look bad, AJ Bowen is really cute in all his scruffy glory (he's Crispin from You're Next) and there are a few gory moments.

The actress for the main villain hams it up and her over  the top style really works for the role. Too bad her motives just don't make a lot of sense.

Would You Rather has a similar setup and I found that movie to be far more engaging. I recommend that over this flick.

Worth one watch if it's free but you're not missing much if you skip this one.",1478822400,,1318,4.377049180327869
