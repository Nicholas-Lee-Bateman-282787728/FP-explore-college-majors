321028,4,6301094352,"For F13 lovers, part 7 is one of the better installments of the series. Decent characters, decent plot, with some humor mixed in. Also some great effects - Jason looks perfect in this film! The scene where he emerges from  the lake, and you can see some bones in his back, is a classic. This is  what a Friday the 13th flick should be. Too bad the series took a turn for  the worse with parts 8 & 9.",918518400,2,399,4.025316455696203
321029,1,6301094352,"With little showing of gory effects because of an MPAA crackdown on movie violence and a paper-thin story, Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood has absolutely no redeeming qualities and is incredibly boring.  Sadly, the acting of Lar Park Lincoln as telekenetic heroine Tina, Susan Blu as her agitated mother, and Terry Kiser as her conniving psychiatrist is very nicely done, but can't hold up the rest of the movie no matter how hard it tries.  A useless installment that should be avoided.  END",902188800,,500,4.790697674418604

321098,1,6301094352,"Jason rises again to stab, slice and sever the partygoing youths of Crystal Lake. This time, he stares down with a fellow supernatural: Tina, a troubled young woman with telekinetic abilities and an equally tragic history with the location. Points for shaking up the formula a tad, but this gimmick is just as ham-fisted and overplayed as everything else the series has tried to freshen itself up. Along with Tina's bad floating-toaster act, we still get the requisite amount of shallow teenage stereotypes - boring characters who don't really deserve their fate but certainly won't be mourned - and magical Jason hide-and-seek performances. Once again crippled by the censors, the kills are all cut short, and without those frequent, bloody, money shots to rely on, there's really no reason to bother tuning in. This entry's final surprise - a callback to the first film that's already been aped once or twice before - is so snort-inducingly bad I can't believe it actually got the green light. Stupid, toothless, time-wasting schlock.",1476662400,,1036,5.1

321152,4,6301094352,"The New Blood is a great horror movie. I like the way it introduced the telekinetic powers of Tina into the franchise. Jason is scary as ever as the unstoppable great white shark type killer. The best you can do is survive him, you can't kill him. The movie has great scares and in a few instances has you rooting for Jason. It's got some memorable kills as well (i.e. the sleeping bag smash).

That was a sign this series was in trouble, and it continued in the following movie. Jason looks like a walking piece of garbage. Tina is joke to female slasher heroes.

321155,5,6301094352,"In Part 7: The New Blood of the Friday the 13th series, the psychic but tormented, Tina Shepard is en route with her mother and her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews to Camp Crystal Lake, the same place her father tragically drowned many years back, large in part thanks to her psychic powers. Tina hopes that visiting the lake will help her face and overcome a lot of the guilt she's felt about his death.

While visiting, she meets and befriends a number of young adults in their 20s. As if poor Tina wasn't carrying enough problems, the same psychiatrist that's supposed to be helping her, begins trying to manipulate Tina's powers and abilities for his own selfish means. Tina, Dr. Crews, and everyone else bordering Camp Crystal Lake are in for a terrifying surprise when Tina's powers accidentally resurrect Jason from his watery grave. Now, Tina's same powers that brought Jason back to life, she must use to defeat him and send him back to his grave or risk Hell's favorite hockey goalie walk the grounds of Camp Crystal Lake forever",1463097600,,1031,4.727777777777778
321156,3,6301094352,"friday the 13th part vii: a new blood. love this movie, even though it features one of the more forgettable selections of jason fodder in a f13 flick. tina, played by the delightful lar park lincoln, is awesome, and i think the filmmakers were ""wise"" to give her telekinetic powers. spice things up a bit. the most fun is that tina mostly does things with her incredible powers that she could have done quite easily with her hands, like spraying gasoline all over jason or knocking him in the head with lamps. still, she is a worthy opponent for mrs. voorhees' little goalie. i also really liked terry kiser, aka bernie of weekend at fame, as the evil dr. crews, who has nefarious designs on tina and her abilities. kane hodder makes his debut as jason, and he moves with an inexorable and murderous purpose. known to many of us as a professional, hardworking make-up fx meastro, john carl buechler ably directs this woodland stalk and kill that has gentle fantasy aspirations. a little more effort on the supporting characters could have put this in the rarefied air of parts 2, 6, and 4. like part vi, the true butcher of this film is the mpaa. so many kills cut away from an obvious gag, and it becomes pretty antagonizing by the end of the movie. so many good set-ups, so little payoff. still, good fun to be had in the somewhat different take on this venerable franchise.",1460160000,,1376,4.55241935483871

321363,4,6301094352,"How things come to transpire: The movie starts out with a little recap of some other F13 movies along with a narrator, but for the most part it recaps on the previous part 6.  This time for the opening credits you see Jason hockey mask having a bright light peaking out through the holes of his mask, and then the mask cracks apart and then you see the movies title.  It starts out with a cute little 7 year old girl named Tina Shepard who overhears her father John Shepard being abusive to her mother Amanda Shepard, in the cabin by the lake that they're staying in.  Tina gets miffed and gets in a paddle boat.  Her father shouts at her to come back, but Tina isn't having it.  She then accidentally uses her psychokineteic/telekinetic powers to cause the dock to break apart which brings her father to a watery death in Crystal Lake.  Ten years pass and Tina has grown up into a beautiful teenage woman.  Her mother takes her to see a psychiatrist named Dr. Crews (Weekend at Bernie's 1&2).  Tina(Lar Park Lincoln, House II: The Second Story)  briefly meets local pretty boy Nick(Kevin Blair, Subspecies parts 2-4, The Hills Have Eyes II(1985) ) in an awkward scene.  When she meets with Dr. Crews he first attempts to test her by having her focus on a matchbook.  Tina out of fear of her powers ala Carrie, guilt over her father's death, and lack of total certainty as to how to use them, is unsuccessful in Dr. Crews's test.  Dr. Crews proves abrasive and impatient with Tina and tries to get her angry to get her to better utilize her powers but, that didn't work too well either.  Tina walks to the new dock that was built after her unfortunate incident with her father.  Tina's emotions take helm of her powers and she accidentally ends up bringing Jason back to life.  Nick comes to pay Tina a visit to invite her to his cousin Michael's birthday party, she accepts and meets quite a group of teen kids ranging from really weird, beautiful and hot, snobbish, ugly and unpopular, all the way to just plain anal retentive.  Jason's got quite an onslaught of possible victims to choose from here.  Can Tina stop Jason?  With her trauma to get over to fully utilize her powers, let's hope.

The Producer is Iain Patterson.  The Director is John Carl Buechler. He's also did the gore effects.  The music is cleverly composed by Harry Manfredini & Fred Mollin.

The gore effects are brilliantly handled, as they look very realistic and are perfectly timed within the death scenes.  The kill scenes are many and show alot of style and impact.  Some of my favorite kill scenes include: Jason picking up one of his victims while inside a sleeping bag, and bashing her against a tree.  That one was so famous that it was used again in Jason X.  The kill where Jason slices one of his victims face with a machete.  Simple but effective.  Finally, the scene where Jason shoves a party whistle through the eye of another one of his victims.  That one was a silly death, but one can't say that it's not creative nor can one say that it's ever been done before.

The music is extremely intense, a little emotional, and very in your face no non-sense in its seriously tense elements.

The location is beautiful as always and it looks innocent enough until the horror comes about.  Not much is done with the weather this time, there's a bit of lightning but that's it.  The underwater scenes are brilliantly shot and perfectly lit.

The concept of pitting Jason against someone with psychic powers, proved to be a bold and clever move that brought something new to the table.  The scenes where Tina uses her powers on Jason allow for some incredible excitement as well as the chase scenes.

This is the first time that Jason was played by iconic and charismatic stuntman/actor Kane Hodder.  Kane played Jason like he's played him before.  He got right into character from the start.

The character developement is pretty good and the chemistry between Nick and Tina is very believable and sweet.  They're also both very attractive too.

There are not many scenes of nudity, but what there is of it is fabulous.  Great female nudity to be sure.

Overall, for anyone that loves a good slasher, F13 movie, 80's horror in general, supernatural horror, psychic powers, beautiful people, good nudity, excellent tension and scares stemming from both the music and the scenes equally, characters with trauma that must be overcome, interesting characters, and above all a different approach to this franchise, than this one's for you.",1444348800,3,4517,4.64312736443884
321364,5,6301094352,"""They say he died as a boy, but he keeps coming back.""  Narrator Walt Gorney intones this latest warning at the beginning of the movie.  Gorney played Crazy Ralph in the first and second movies in this series.  No one did gloom and doom better than he could, the old sourpuss.  Along with the prologue, there are kill scenes from the previous movies, a greatest hits opus, before this entry finally gets underway.  In this offering, a mentally disturbed girl (Lar Park Lincoln as Tina Shepard) is brought back to the scene of her crime.  Coincidentally, she murdered her dad on the dock near where Jason was enjoying the pond scum.  She's there on the behest of her psychotic doctor (Terry Kiser) who claims he has a cure for Tina but in reality, he's only after her telekinetic power.  To what end?  It's never explained or explored.  This crazy doctor spends most of his time in a menacing manner, threatening to return Tina to the loony bin if she doesn't cooperate.  MEANWHILE, just next door there's a party going on only the birthday boy and his date have failed to show up.  The idiots took a shortcut through the woods and met the waterlogged Jason on a stroll.  One thing leads to another and mass murder ensues (although, sadly, all of the murder sequences were heavily edited to avoid an X rating).

Originally, this was meant to be the Freddy VS Jason crossover.  Unfortunately, Paramount Pictures and New Line Cinema couldn't come to any mutual agreement on the idea and it failed to materialize until much later.
Otherwise, more of the same.  Thank goodness.",1444089600,,1572,4.682481751824818

A young woman, Tina, finds herself with powers as a young adult. She is not the nice little girl you see at the beginning, but yet is responsible for her father's seeming death after an explosive mental scenario. Years later under the care of her mother and ""doctor"", she is taken to the forest and lake where at the same time, a nearby house is rented out by a group of young adults. You know the situation. Weekend, Party, Lake, Jason. Sound inviting or does it remind you of ""The ""Final Chapter""? lol This time, instead of being there to try and work on her ""mind powers"" with the ""Doctor"", she discovers she is being used by him for private gain. Lar Park Lincoln gives a good performance as Tina, one of the main characters besides Jason, of course. Kane Hodder plays a great role as the lead baddie. Richard Brooker and Kane are my favorite Jason actors. I think Ted White did a great job in pt. 4 also.
After yet another explosive episode sends Tina on the brink, she has revived and unleashed Jason back on the scene from his watery ""grave"" and he isn't in the mood to party!
Only Tina holds the key to putting this killer away for good after being the sole survivor of another Jason rampage, ..or does she?
This edition has some great and wonderful effects for Jason as we finally begin to see he is rotting away (like he didn't all that time in the grave at the beginning of part VI) lol
There are some good fight scenes, kills and unique ways we have not seen before in this one. Even as the MPAA at the time had to cut away some gory scenes because of an X rating to make it an R rating. The dialog, as with many horror movies is not that great, so don't watch it for that expecting an Oscar performance from the cast. For the roles given and the script, they each did their best, I think. As I said before, I like all of the movies in the franchise, V being my least favorite, this one stands out among the original VIII.

I gave this entry of the series 5 stars for being unique and brilliantly casted. ""Bad news Cruz"" was beyond a coward in this movie, but he got what he deserved. This is the only one in the entire series with someone who doesn't need a weapon to fight back! Although she did revive him by mistake because she wanted her dad back (Using her powers), that's what made Jason come back FULL FORCE and with a vengeance. This film also has THE BEST SCREAM in it too. ""Tina's"" boyfriend ""Nick"" is SUPER HOT! WOW. The explosive seen at the end is brilliant, with the camera shaking from the ground! You could see the earth move when the house exploded! Thank goodness, ""Melissa"" got axed though. She was extremely annoying to watch. Ugh. You can't go wrong with this one, new or used. I can watch this one over and over again! It's somewhat similar to A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. She really kicked his *** in this one! The death scenes are a lot more elaborate too.

321507,3,6301094352,"I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, which started in 1980 with the mega-success of the first film. My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer  who increasingly becomes an infernal monster  just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Voorhees -- Jason, his mother, or anyone under his diabolic spell -- that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element with ""Part III"", which pretty much plagues the rest of the series with the exception of maybe ""Part IV,"" ""Part VII"" and the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.

Released in 1988, ""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood"" takes place about ten years after the previous film, making it about 1999, which explains it's title ""The New Blood"": Tommy Jarvis is no longer in the picture and there's a new set of youthful blood for Jason to spill. This installment is the second to feature Jason as an inhuman rotting corpse and the F/X of Jason at the end are great. The highlight of ""Part VII"" is the inclusion of a Carrie-like heroine with mental powers who squares off against Jason at the end. We also get Terry Kiser as Tina's therapist, Dr. Crews. If you're not familiar with Mr. Kiser, he played the charismatic preacher in 1968's ""Rachel, Rachel"" in the mind-blowing Pentecostal service sequence.

Although my title blurb describes this segment as ""Carrie vs. Jason"", the movie isn't like 1976's ""Carrie"" (or its sequels and remakes) at all. It's the same Friday the 13th formula, but with a protagonist who has Carrie-like abilities.

This entry features, by far, the weakest collection of females, at least as far as curvy beauty goes, but I suppose that's a matter of taste. Tina's an interesting character though.

As far as locations go, ""Part VII"" was shot in Southern Alabama, in and around Mobile.

Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but  with the exception of the 2009 reboot  I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Part VII"" is another retread of the same Friday formula with the distinction of the protagonist having Carrie-like psycho-kinetic powers and, like the previous film, Jason is now totally inhuman -- an infernal monster. In addition, the climax is the best yet, featuring the ""Carrie"" vs. Jason fight and a spectacular explosion. Unfortunately ""Part VII"" has the least interesting assortment of women in the series. Nevertheless, it's a fairly entertaining installment that thankfully lacks the camp of III, V and VI.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER***): No, the corpse of Tina's Dad was not left in the lake for ten years, the original ending made it clearer that her Dad's body coming out of the lake was a product of Tina's mind powers, although the long chain was real. Of course, this doesn't explain why Jason's corpse was still in the lake early in the film, but we could chalk that up to the curse that was on Crystal Lake and the fact that no one in their right mind would want to visit that part of the lake (anywhere near ""Camp Blood"") by this point in the series.

The film runs 88 minutes.

D: John Carl Buechler

P: A telekinetic girl accidentally uses her powers to unleash Jason from his watery grave so that he can resume his killing spree.

Part 5 attempted to add some elements of psychology & mystery. Part 6 threw in some humor. By the time part 7 came around, these Jason films were all starting to look awfully similar. Part 7 attempted to differentiate itself from the previous entries by going with a Carrie vs. Jason type storyline. It's not enough to breath new life into this franchise, but at least they tried to do something different, something original.

The New Blood features a bit more character development then usual. The New Blood also served as the jumping off point for horror icon Kane Hooder. And while it's not as bloody as the previous films, for once Jason has a worthy opponent to duke it out to the death in the film's climatic battle. [R] 90 mins.",1387238400,,1094,4.717277486910994

321578,1,6301094352,"Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood was a gruesome addition to the Pamela/Jason Voorhees storyline and franchise. We, the early '80s infant-boomers, grew up with Friday the 13th and remember watching Part VII quite vividly. And although we were angelic youth, seemingly forbidden to watch such a movie as this, we allowed absolutely no one to persuade us from the trepidation that followed. We showed no fear while courageously planting ourselves in front of the television to view a bunch of naive teens as they party late into the night, deep in the woods, only to be pursued and disposed of by a maniacal, goalie-mask-wearing, knife-wielding killer!

The year was 1987, and up until that point I had only seen Friday the 13th Part V and VI on television. Believe it or not, I had no idea, in '87, that parts 1-4 existed! Looking back, I suppose that my Mother had her reasons for keeping my sisters and I sheltered away from such violence. So, by the time Part VII rolled around, my siblings and I became aware of the slasher g&eacute;ner&eacute; in films. We pretty much knew what to expect from a Friday the 13th movie: blood, gore and sheer terror! Part VIII is most significant to me because I actually remember watching the uncut television version in it's entirety back in 1989 on Cinemax! I was going on 8 years old that year and I distinctly recall several original murders take place, including Maddy's grueling death, which had a bit more footage, more overhead camera shots and a great deal of stalking and torture from Jason, all resulting in her original death. I felt incredibly sad for Maddy (Diana Barrows) during her demise and I remember voicing my opinion to my Mother as the scene unfolded right before my eyes on television! Another stand-out death was Kate (Diane Almeida) and her subsequent reaction of extreme fear after getting rammed in her eyeball with a party horn. It was because of her reaction that I suffered nightmares for several weeks to follow, not to mention the excessive blood and gore running from her eyeball. Kate's boyfriend Ben suffered just the same for his original death was past the point of traumatizing!

I must admit there was a moment during the film when my sister and I began to laugh. Surprisingly, the sleeping bag kill brought on a level of horror and humor that was impossible to ignore. While Jason stood there banging the body repeatedly against the tree, we knew even then as children that 6 slams were more than enough. The entire scene came across, dare I say, comical?! And speaking as a faithful fan of the Friday franchise, I must confess that not every kill is or should be usable on film! For example: Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D - Chris' non-identical prosthetic head and torso for the alternate dream sequence, which, in my opinion, looked more like Chili's head/hair. And Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning - Jake's prosthetic head for his original, extended death. Then there are those that come across as ""too"" real - Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D, Vera's full original death, and Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning, Lana's original death. We often think of the MPAA as the true thieves of horror films, particularly with the Friday franchise. Make no mistake, the proof is within the final versions of each film! The ratings board (censors) absolutely destroyed parts 2, 3, (4 is debatable), 5, 6, 7 and 8 without guilt! But, you see, there is another side to it all. Let me just say beforehand that I in no way applaud the MPAA for the abuse that they have dispensed upon these films, nor do I condone or support such savage behavior! With that said, there are times when they are faced with doing what's right for the cohesiveness of the film. And then there are moments where they simply go overboard. Because, yes, it is possible for a death scene to fall flat. Each adaptation is different in its own way. So, depending on the makeup effects artist for that particular film, there's a 20 to 30 percent chance for mistakes, thus causing certain scenes to look a bit off, silly or, to put it bluntly, fake! Basically when you get right down to it, the MPAA is there to do what they're paid to do by omitting ineffective movie reels that could singlehandedly ruin the film's true integrity.

Since a few years back, I have been struggling with the reality concerning the whereabouts of Part VII. It is my understanding that filmmakers/directors are supposed to be involved with the TV versions of their films. In this case, with Part VII, if you have a film that was so heavily edited by the censorsnot to mentioned absolutely despised by the associated producerthen the only smart thing to do would be to take full advantage of cable television and total control of your original print work. John Carl Buechler had every reason to give the public what he knew we were robbed of during the film's theatrical release. I think it's safe to say that John was the sole reason for why Part VII aired on Cinemax in its unedited format! This now brings me to my next question, and I ponder this one often. Because of the fact that Part VII was aired on TV to the director's liking, could this be the reason why the outtakes were subsequently destroyed by PARAMOUNT THEMSELVES? Could Paramount or someone working for Paramount actually have the gall to obliterate one mans work? Would they hinder very vital pieces of his print work from Friday fans, eliminating even the smallest chance for those scenes to see the light of day? I believe so! I mean c'mon. Who really has it out for John, and why does he or she have such strong animosity toward him? You know, It's just too damn bad that John didn't keep that Cinemax copy in his possession. For years I was optimistic that someone would eventually come forward with at least a VHS copy of the '89 airing. Such a discovery would not only make the owner somewhat wealthy, but would finally give the fans of Part VII a long overdue sigh of relief! I truly believe that the unedited TV version is out there somewhere and that someone who may not actually know that they have it, or simply may not care, owns it! And as far as the version that aired on Cinemax, well, let's face it, this was in 1989, and decades have come and gone since then. Who knows whether their copy disappeared over time or was destroyed as well. I cringe at the thought of it, but one thing I have learned over the years is that when it comes to the Friday franchise, we must EXPECT THE WORST and hope for the best!

Despite Paramounts reasons for such careless and dishonest conduct toward John and his work, we the consumers must put an end to this insanity! The fans shall no longer feed into the blatant lies and deceit. Fans must also do their best to avoid this double/triple-dipping fad that has become so popular with the Friday franchise. Sure, we now have a box set of all 12 Friday's (including FvJ) on Blu-Ray, but do not be fooled! Paramounts decision to release each film on Blu-Ray was their way of banking off of fans yet again! This purchase/repurchasing cycle has clouded the minds of many fans, in particularly with the younger up-and-coming generation, and it's affecting the process in which others have worked very hard to achieve! The days of enabling Paramount this type of fraudulent behavior are far behind us and we shall continue to stand up against this issue! You must understand, Paramount is only interested in stringing fans along with the intent to create a profit. Sadly enough, their main goal is to continue releasing duplicate copies of the early seven Friday films, along with more so-called ""lost/destroyed"" footage. Then, without shame, they'll take a 3 to 5 year hiatus, only to return AGAIN with MORE extended ""lost/damaged"" material on yet ANOTHER ""special"" release. This is now the case with the documentaries as well. The bigwigs at Paramount are more than likely sitting around smiling as they collect their fair share, all while undermining die-hard fans with these abominable ""Deluxe Edition/Ultimate Collection/Complete Collection"" DVD's, which prove to be nothing more than second-rate, recycled trash!

So let's zoom in on the facts here. Clearly, the Part VII Deluxe Edition DVD is nothing more than a duplicate of the 2004 box set version, but with additional ""lost/destroyed"" footage, correct? Footage that was once thought of as the ""ONLY"" remaining compilation of ""lost destroyed"" print work. Yet, with every new re-release comes just A LITTLE MORE footage. I guess someone wasn't exactly truthful about the ""lost/damaged"" footage when they presented the first film strip in 2004. Paramount (Part VII's film director included) could have easily added the entire roll of the ""new-found"" blue, grainy, damaged footage when they released the box set edition the FIRST time around, don't you think? Or was the box set just too damn full at the time?! It's as simple as this: combine the footage from the box set, the Deluxe Edition, and all the other lost material they have harbored away and there you have itFriday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood Uncut/Unrated! The same can be said about the television version from 1989. A VHS transfer to disc would be considered the uncut/unedited version as well. Keep in mind, Part 1 is sitting in several local entertainment stores in uncut format. And then we have Friday the 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter, with tons of glorious extended footage, including an impressive jump-scare scene and an overall flawless transfer. And even though the director made claims of a lost voice track, I believe that Part 4 could be one step away from receiving the same royal treatment as Part 1. We shall see. Frankly, I'm over it!

As I bring this matter to a close, I must reiterate that I was a witness to the original uncut version of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, which aired on the Cinemax cable network in 1989! My admission further proves that the complete version exists somewhere! I used to believe that those money hungry vultures at Paramount were withholding the excised material from us on purpose, but I've just upgraded my opinion. I now believe that they in fact destroyed John's work out of spite for reasons unknown! Several years ago when I purchased the 2004 box set, I arrived home, unwrapped the box and immediately played Part VII. I was expecting to view the exact version I watched on television close to 20 years ago and had no reason to suspect any wrongdoing. At the time, I was unfamiliar with the censorship that plagued this film. So as I sat and watched the movie, I began to notice that something was terribly wrong! There were so many scenes that are severely cut! Such a sad, sad discovery! It was at that moment I realized this was not an illusion, but that someone was to blame for ruining Part VII! Then I discovered the bonus disc...UGH! At that very moment, I made a promise that I would wait for the release of the original movie. And if we the fans keep a mutual united front against Paramounts' greedy advances, we will eventually wear them down and hopefully get the truth about the other 5 films as well! We are the consumers and they would not own one shiny cent if it weren't for OUR love and appreciation for Pamela Voorhees, Jason Voorhees and the entire Friday franchise!

I believe that what's done in the dark will soon come to light and Paramount is destined to learn their lesson. I foresee a major decline in sales 5 to 10 years from now for the fans will eventually catch on, thus forcing Paramount to plot and plan another strategy. Come what may of this predicament, I will continue to sit tight for the unrated/unedited version of this film, as well as the other films. I grew up watching FT13th; I honor and respect this franchise! I just wish I could say the same for the production company AND the MPAA! I have stated my truth and I am concluding any future dealings with Paramount concerning Friday the 13th! On the same token, I will remain optimistic. The fraudulent conduct that plagues this franchise is to be taken seriously and, frankly, speaks volumes about the type of deceitful human beings that we are truly dealing with! Again, I'm hoping for the best. I guess only time will tell.",1379548800,2,12255,4.673459935155164

This is one of my favorite movies in the series due to the great FX, the awesome look to Jason, and the kickass cast. I love the character of Tina and I love the way she puts up a great fight. When I'm in the mood to watch a Friday The 13th film, this is usually the one I pick.

As for the DVD Special Features its nice to see the extra deleted scenes that weren't on the original release, or the release from the Box Set. The picture quality seems better then previous DVD releases as well.

Now years later, she is under therapy. Her therapist is played By Terry Kiser (Bernie!!!) This guy is an obvious dick who doesn't care one thing about Tina, he only is intrigued by what she can do. And like always, at a neighboring house there is a teenage party going on with either snob girls or dumb drunk guys. Now this is the Friday the 13th that had the most gore cut from it, I've seen these cut scenes and I was very disappointed they weren't in the final film. I mean MPAA doesn't ban some of this crazy stuff thats on TV now-a-days, so why target stuff like this? I'm glad they killed off the characters they killed, they killed the right annoying characters in my opinion, and the right people lived. Bernie (LOL) suffers a pretty grizzly death involving an electric tree trimmer. I felt bad for the mother getting killed at Dr. Cruises will.

When Jason is unmasked by her telekenatic powers, that is the best unmasked Jason there has ever been in any film. Its so indescribable to me, I cannot say much, it is so inhuman looking. The big explosion at the end was pretty sweet with the house, and had a pretty good ending.

So if you want a kick-ass fighting movie with psychic powers, this si for you, and another great Friday the 13th film, and I would strongly tell you o get the deluxe edition to view gore scenes in the special features.",1278374400,,1735,4.362229102167182

***  Out of 5

Release Date- September 15th, 2009

THE MOVIE
Considered by many fans to be the best sequel and by some the best of the series; I have to disagree on both accounts, but The New Blood was a fun entry into the series. Not exactly a classic of the genre, but generally well made and fun.

PACKAGE DESIGN
I was never fond of the original artwork for the movie, but this new artwork I personally think is rather lousy; it isn't the worst artwork, but I just didn't care for it.

AUDIO COMMENTARY- John Carl Buechler, Kane Hodder, Lar Park-Lincoln
Buechler and Hodder record a new commentary track, Hodder does his over the phone with Buechler on the other end. Lar Park-Lincoln though isn't with them and her track and Hodder's and Buechler's are edited together.

JASON'S DESTROYER: THE MAKING OF THE NEW BLOOD- 15:04
This was a strong feature that mostly covers the battles with the MPAA and how they had to cut the movie down to avoid an X-Rating and also covered is John Carl Buechler's battles with the Associate Producer over the vision of the movie; I'm sure most fans of the series probably already know everything brought up, but it's still a fun watch. Interviews with John Carl Buechler, Lar Park-Lincoln, Kane Hodder, Kevin Blair, Barry Zetlin, Diana Barrows, Elizabeth Kaitan, Fred Mollin, John Otrin

SLASHED SCENES- 16:13
This was sort of seen on the Crystal Lake to Manhattan set; the set featured the cut gore scenes with Buechler and Hodder doing a commentary; this time around the commentary is gone and more scenes were added that were cut from the final cut. Most of the footage is weak looking with some of the footage almost being unwatchable; the gore scenes are great to see, but the rest of what was cut isn't anything special and was better off being left on the cutting room floor, but it's still nice to see.

MIND OVER MATTER: THE TRUTH ABOUT TELEKINESS- 7:22
Decent feature that is too brief to really be too good; interesting, but like I said too short to be much.

MAKE OVER MADDY NEED A LITTLE TOUCH UP WORK MY A**- 2:39
This feature is with Elizabeth Kaitan and Diana Barrows and was a nice filler feature; nothing special, but semi entertaining.

TRANSFER
Mastered in High-Definition, The New Blood is nice improvement over the original DVD release; flesh tones look a lot better and the colors are far more detailed and overall any details lost in the old DVD are improved upon in the new transfer; there is some grain through the movie, but it's never distracting. I own the first 3 on Blu-ray and the rest on the Deluxe Editions and all are improvements over the original DVDs any details lost on the old transfers are found in the new ones, but is still feel The Final Chapter is the only one that got enhanced by the new transfer seeing as the original DVD looked like a high quality VHS; overall The New Blood has a really excellent transfer and this shows DVD can still look excellent if the time is put into it; The Final Chapter is still my favorite of the HD transfers, but The New Blood looks strong and is in my opinion as good as the first 2 movies on Blu-ray.

AUDIO

5.1 Surround
2.1 Surround

The sound is strong, but never really enhances the movie in my opinion.

FINAL WORDS ON THE DISC
Overall this was a fairly decent release at the end of the day the disc doesn't really have all that much, but it's still nice to have a legit SE DVD for the film. Sadly this is still R-rated and I would have liked to have seen Paramount attempt to re-master the footage a little bit and put it back into the film; with some decent extras and a nice transfer I'd recommend the DVD to fans of the series.",1264032000,3,3700,4.452662721893491

THE SLEEPING BAG MURDER IS STILL CENSORED.

I saw this movie in the theater in May of 1988.
I saw the complete uncut sleeping bag scene.
Everyone in the theater screamed like maniacs.
It was shocking.
It was horrifying.
It was THE greatest moment in the Friday series.

321744,5,6301094352,"Years after Tommy Jarvis put Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) back in the bottom of Crystal Lake where he belongs, a beautiful young teen girl named Tina Shepard (Lar Park Lincoln) was once a resident there as a child when she accidently killed her father with her psychic powers. Her mother (Susan Blu) takes her back to consult with a doctor (Terry Kiser) about the trauma she's been through. While she's there, Tina meets up with a group of youths including Nick (Kevin Spirtas) and Melissa (Susan Jennifer Sullivan) befriend her and she also accidently unleashes Jason from his watery tomb as he unleashes more ghastly mayhem abound.

Another fantastic entry of the neverending horror franchise ""Friday The 13th""! Here you have plenty of nude babes, graphic gore even though some were cut out, decent performances and a nice premise. I love the idea of a telekinetic/psychic girl in that Akira, Scanners and Carrie tradition and Jason looks more [...] then ever even without his mask during the amazing climax. The gore here is quite nice with a body count of 16 dead bodies including a death by party-favor which is just unbelievable, originally this was suppose to be Freddy Vs. Jason at the time but New Line and Paramount Pictures could agree to it so the idea was changed to a Carrie-like girl vs. Jason premise instead. It wasn't until 1992 when New Line Cinema bought the rights to the franchise that it would be possible for Jason to meet Freddy as it was hinted at the end of ""Jason Goes to Hell"" then 10 years later, wallah in 2003 ""Freddy Vs. Jason"".

This DVD offers brilliant picture and sound quality even with the remastering done right with some cool extras like audio commentary, three featurettes and slashed scenes with intro on the stuff that the MPAA had to cut out to avoid an X rating.",1254960000,,1808,4.718354430379747
321745,2,6301094352,"Yeah, this one is famous for being a Friday the 13th fan's high mark.  I really can't see why though.  It's pretty awful.  It doesn't even have the cheap thrills of over the top gore, or the intentional humor of part 6.  The only thing cool, for me at least, about this entry is the fact that Jason's zombie-fied make-up design is really cool and genuinely innovative.  Plus, having Kane Hodder don the hockey mask for the first time could be considred worth something.  It's weird how Hodder became the most famous Jason but starred in the character's least watchable films.

I've heard a lot of fanboy fumblings regarding that in this film Jason finally met a worth apponent, someone who could actually stand up to him.  Right.  So instead of a calvacade of different characters causing Jason damage we get one chick.  Oh, and she's telekentic to boot.  Real innovative guys.  Really.  It doesn't help that the results of her telekentic powers are some of the worst and cheesily hilarious special effects ever put on film.  Carrie was made over ten years before this flick and the effects of her powers were much more interesting and believable.  It doesn't help that our 'final girl' Tina is a whiney, jittery, froo-froo dog of a person that spends most of her time running somewhere to cry like she was in a bad 80's after school special either.  Lar Park Lincoln is a pretty actress, despite her frizzy silly hair cut, but this film gives her nothing to do but be annoying.

This entry in the series is notorious for two things: 1, How the MPAA butchered the money shots in every death scene, and 2, the horrible ending.  This is the most meatless Jason film ever made.  At least if the over the top gore had been left in tact the film would have some laughs and some awe-inspiring, cringe-inducing moments to look forward to, but without them it's very rote and boring.  The ending is just awful in the final film and the rough cut ending.  The ending was just a bad idea from inception.  At least in the rough cut version we get to see some nifty zombie make up on zombie make up action, but the idea is still pandering and silly.

As for the new Deluxe edition DVD, well it's nothing to get too excited about.  Unlike the first four films the transfer is about the same quality as the original box set's.  So the film still looks good visually.  Nope, no reinstated gore scenes put back into the film.  We get them again in their rough cut form, introduced by director and creature creator John Carl Buechler(Troll, Ghoulies, Carnasaur) similar to the way they were presented in the box set release's Extras disc.  We get a new retrospective doc running about 11 minutes that has new interviews with Buecler and Kande hodder, and importing vintage footage of Lar Park Lincoln from the box sets retro doc.  Nothing really new is said regarding the film.  It's the same stuff we found out with the From Crystal Lake to Manhattan box set.  We also get a newly recorded commentary track featuring Buecler, Lar Park Lincoln, and a phoned in Kane Hodder.  The original box set's disc of this film also had a commentary by Hodder and Buechler, so most of the new commentary is monopolized by Lincoln.  Not bad, at least it was something new, but I am much more interested in Buechler's and Hodder's musings and stories then this actress'.  So, if you still have the box set don't get rid of the Par 7 disc if you like commentaries.  Finally, we get the most useless of useless special features, a mini doc showing two characters getting a make over called ""You could use a little work, my a#@!""  Yes, the two master female thespians that had their forever immortalized on film argument about how one of them wasn't hot enough for a specific guy are back together 20 years later to get a glamour make over, and we are there to witness all the details.  You have to be a really, really, REALLY hardcore fan of this film to give a crap or get any entertainment out of this special feature.

Bottom line is, if you have the box set, this particular sequel isn't worth double dipping for.  I've the franchise completist disease, especially when it comes to horror, so I had to pick it up.  Plus, Jason's make up is really cool and worth having in perfect clarity for posterities sake.  I doubt anyone will ever shell out the dough to refurbish and reincorporate the rough cut gore scenes back into this film.  Paramount would never see the kind of returns they would want to spend the time and money on such a thing. Maybe if Buechler himself shells out the money this will happen.  So, if you're only buying this to see Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood uncut, you will be sorely disappointed.....again.  Me, I think this film mostly sucks so I don't really care that much.",1254096000,6,4776,4.529205607476635
321746,5,6301094352,"This seventh ""Friday"" is the beginning mark of a very stale series (they should have ended it w/ this one . Paramount got lucky w/ part VI).

Her powers are uncontrollable however, & during one of her fits accidently brings Jason up from his watery grave to kill again. Basically, its Carrie vs. Jason. Lar Park Lincoln plays Tina, the telekenetic & Kane Hodder masks up for the first time, in what would turn out to be the first of four ""Friday"" outings as Jason. The Deluxe Edition is quite nice with new scenes that have not been seen before included and the special features are quite cool.",1253923200,,754,4.510948905109489
321802,5,6301094352,"I owned a VHS workprint of this film and I have to say that after countless viewings over the years which wore out the sound and image, it is a welcoming surprise to finally get such a clean transfer of this film on DVD.  Everything on this DVD is super crisp.  After watching the Deluxe Edition two times in a row I threw my workprint copy in the garbage even though it was the uncut version of the film.  Yes, this new version is that good!

I especially like the tie in between this film and Weekend at Bernie's.  In Friday the 13th Part VII, we get an alternate version of Bernie's death before his corpse is discovered by the characters played by Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman in the 1989 comedy classic.  The only discrepancy in Friday the 13th Part VII is that it doesn't explain how Bernie's body was brought from Camp Crystal Lake to the beach house community near Rhode Island where Weekend at Bernie's takes place.  I was hoping that the Deluxe Edition of Friday the 13th Part VII would be able to answer this question through a deleted scene (or at least on the commentary track) but, again, the fans will just have to wait for the next edition of the film to come out and hope it ties up that loose end once and for all.  Still, it's cool to see how Bernie (played by Terry Kiser) made his money by working as a psychiatrist for troubled teens with telekinetic powers before he met Jason Voorhees (unfortunately).

This is also the first film in the Friday the 13th franchise to cast Kane Hodder as Jason who, in the eyes of many fans, is the best actor to ever portray the villain.  The acting in this film is also better that it is in most other Friday the 13th films.  If you were ever curious to see Terry Kiser's acting abilities before he played a corpse in Weekend at Bernie's, then you should definitely see this film.",1252972800,4,1848,4.374269005847953

I own the From Crystal Lake to Manhattan set and I may buy these dvds when I have nothing better to buy or this upcoming Halloween when they are on sell.

This movie has the best ending to any Friday the 13th film, but the whole movie is pretty good. Kane Hodder debuts as Jason and many fans claim he is the ultimate Jason. The problem everyone has with the film is many of the best kills were edited and not alot was shown. I've seen the uncut scenes on the bonus disc of From Crytal Lake to Manhattan and they should have just added them in ala My Blood Valentine re-release.

321808,4,6301094352,"This movie is actually rather endearing...a sci fi bent, combining Stephen King's Carrie with the slasher movie template given by John Carpenter's Halloween.

This is easily the most entertaining of the entire Friday the 13th series.  Cool killer death scenes, a telekinetic sub plot where for once the good in this series (Tina) is actually as interesting and exciting as the bad (Jason Voorhies).....

Terry Kiser (Weekend at Bernies) adds just enough of a comedy bent to keep it interesting.

The Melissa girl in this movie is a snob, compared to the stereotypical good girl Tina (who also just happens to be able to move objects with her mind).

Just a ""fun"" horror movie. The totally unbelievability of this movie makes it that much more entertaining.

I've heard that the scares in this movie are supposed to be that much better in the uncut versions, but I've never seen it, and a movie with this much odd horror charm, I am really excited for it.

My personal Friday the 13th in order from fave to least (I'm only counting those first 8, though I have seen all but the latest re-release)...

1) Friday the 13th part 7 (4 stars out of 5, most entertaining in horror interest and sci fi).

2) Friday the 13th part 2. (4 stars)  Pre mask Jason, real Jason debut....has some real scares, bad acting, and horror charm....also incidentally with a little strange bent/twist....I swap between which of these 2 I prefer, but I think overall it's #7 first.  Not masterpiece's but good revisions of the slasher template....far better than any of the post Halloween *sans maybe H20 where it's comparable* sequels and post Nightmare on Elmstreet sequels..

3) Friday the 13th part 4, the Corey Feldman one (main Corey Feldman one).  Far from great, but for a series not a bad one either.  It does have a very young Crispin H. Glover debut a bit of his eventual strange/weird genius in an awkward nerd-dance scene too and that probably adds a bit (Glover from Back to the Future, Rivers Edge, Willard, the Doors, Like Mike, etc antifame, a strange yet oddly always entertaining actor)....  2.5 stars.

4) Friday the 13th, Friday the 13th (part 1).  2.5 stars.  Maybe if I was alive when this came out I would have appreciated it more.  Not bad, but a bit dated and very poorly lit which keeps it hard to see at times....and takes some of the maybe scares out....  The best thing about this though is the special effects (done by the guy who directed the very solid, underrated remake of Night of the Living Dead, can't remember his name off hand), but the Kevin Bacon scene is still a really awesome trick almost 30 years later...

5) Friday the 13th part 3 in 3d. a low 2.5 stars  The best opening scenes of this series, it starts to drag though a bit. Still it's the debut of the mask.... and when that annoying mask guy gets his, it's really awesome...

6) Friday the 13th part 5 the ""Dudley"" movie (Dudley from Diff'rent Strokes).  THere is some cool scenes around the barn, but it takes too long to get there.  2 stars.

7) Friday the 13th part 6.  This of the first 8 has the best effects and production and actually the heart of the story is more developed that really all but perhaps parts 1, 2, and 7 of the series (this story is on par with those at least--not that any are Shakespeare) but oddly I just don't like this one much at all.  Maybe the acting is even worse than in some of the above, but something's rather cool in this, it lost a lot of that very unbelievable charm that makes the others odd guilty pleasures...2 stars.

8) Friday the 13th part 8. Again high production quality (similar to part 6 in that regard), a really really really bad movie though.  1 star.

I would avoid Jason Goes to Hell just as bad as part 8, yet because it bears little resemblance to the series, it's best thought as another movie with the Jason character....not part of that series.

Jason X actually is kind of funny, but more a strange Sci Fi movie and not in that series.

Oh well, as a series, the Friday the 13th is better as a whole really than individual parts (it gets a 3.5 stars as a series, and in horror a series like this is worth the fame, it's good).  It doesn't have a classic like Nightmare on Elmstreet (part 1) or of course Halloween (the original is a masterpiece) but it's sequels are more consistently interesting.....

Oh well.

I'll be probably picking up this revised part 7....at some point, I won't buy likely the other expanded editions cuz I have that Crystal Lake to Manhattan set, but Part 7 always left me wanting more behind the scenes talk, one of my top 30 horror movies ever made--I tend to hate the realistic ones and love the more comic strippy types...

You should check this one out...",1245888000,4,4723,4.507638072855464

She has to battle him using her powers like Carrie at the Prom! It's awesome! It's also cool that we see what Jason looks like. He is more of a monster now.

One, it has the best acting in the franchise supplied by Terry Kiser, Susan Blu and Lar Park Lincoln as Tina, the girl with telekenetic powers. I am glad the producer's decided to add some substance by creating a good story with the telekenesis angle so it wasn't just about young adults getting killed in the woods. There is a nice amount of stalk and slash, suspense, pacing and a scary looking Jason. The make-up job was very well done. The music was chilling and tense and the atmosphere spooky especially in the night scenes. This film is basically combining Carrie and Friday the 13th which makes it awesome. Enjoy!

321811,3,6301094352,"Tina Shepard isn't your normal, everyday girl. When she was younger, she overheard her parents having a heated argument that got really ugly. Tina decided to run out onto a boat in the nearby lake. Her father runs out to try and talk her into coming back to shore and that's when Tina's extraordinary abilities are revealed. Her father winds up dying in an accident caused by Tina's telekinetic powers. In the present day, Tina and her mother are off to a cabin in the woods with Tina's psychologist, Dr. Crews, in hopes of making progress so Tina won't have to return to an institution. A group of young twenty somethings are gathered next door for a surprise birthday party. Both houses just happen to be in the Camp Crystal Lake area. Tina gets upset at Dr. Crews during one of their sessions and runs out to the lake. Her emotions get the best of her and she winds up resurrecting Jason, who's still chained to the bottom of the lake, with telekinesis. Not too long afterward, Tina starts having premonitions of people being gruesomely murdered by a man in a hockey mask. Is she going crazy or are these terrifying visions a reality?

As it stands, this is my guilty pleasure of the franchise. I love the concept and think it would be a really solid Friday the 13th sequel if it wasn't for the MPAA butchering this film. Most of the gore has been cut and it really hurts the film as a whole. This also begins Kane Hodder's reign as the masked serial killer for the franchise, who seems to be a cult favorite as the best Jason. Speaking of Jason, he looks the best in this film. It may just be my opinion, but in addition to loving undead Jason, the make-up effects and his costume are just phenomenal in this one. As ugly as he looks when his mask gets ripped off, this is the film that makes him look the most flattering. That's not saying much for a guy who's been chained down at the bottom of a lake for ten years and killed multiple times, but at least he doesn't look like he has down syndrome this time around. If an uncut or director's cut of some kind ever makes the light of day, it'll probably wind up being in my top three F13 films. Easily.

One of the more enjoyable entries in the series mainly because Jason has someone who can fight back! Unfortunately this film was edited to receive a R rating and the unedited version has yet to be released. It's still a fun entry in the series.

The DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras on the box set.",1239667200,2,513,4.278350515463917

The death scenes were creative and had the potential to be very good if they were shown in the full.

At least the movie tries to be origional by having a psychic character fighting Jason, and the last half hour is good. Overall an average horror movie, that could be great if it was cut to death (no pun intended). Release an un-cut version and i give it 4 or 5 stars.",1237593600,,574,3.991304347826087
321854,4,6301094352,"In Part VII of the Friday the 13th theatrical series, one supernatural creature battles another supernatural creature.  This is reminiscent of the old classic horror films where Dracula battles Frankenstein.  In Part VII, celebrated serial killer Jason Voorhees encounters Tina, a girl who is cursed with telekinetic powers.

  Part VII had the potential to have been so much better.  Ever since ""Carrie"" and ""The Fury,"" I have been fascinated by telekinetic powers - the ability to move or re-shape objects with one's thoughts.  Unfortunately, part VII was plagued with unimaginative kills (except for the sleeping bag incident), poor acting from many of the supporting roles, and a lack of suspense.  The viewer actually sees Jason sneaking upon his victims rather than jumping out at them.

  However, there is some good character development and acting from the lead actors.  Cute, perky Lar Park-Lincoln is great as the troubled teen who is being driven to insanity by her cruel, sadistic psychiatrist, Dr. Crews (wonderfully played by Terry Kiser)  I cheered when he got his just desserts.  Kevin Spirtas (a.k.a. Kevin Blair) Is great as the handsome, rugged Nick who is trying to get his life together after hanging out with the wrong crowd.  Together, Park-Lincoln and Spirtas are an attractive couple, which gains our affection and sympathy.  Susan Jennifer Sullivan is great as the rich, obnoxious snob, Melissa, who is determined to break up Tina and Nick's relationship.  We've all known and hated someone like her.  We also cheered when she gets her just desserts.

  There are some suspenseful and thrilling scenes involving Tina's use of telekinesis.  Jason takes a beating but still keeps going and going.  Unfortunately, the ending was rather lame.  Why didn't anyone drag the lake after Tina's Dad drowned?  Why did they let his corpse, as well as Jason's, stay down there?  I've never known telekinetic powers to bring the dead back to life.  In the world of the supernatural, I guess anything is possible.

  Overall, Part VII, is a must see entry in the Jason Voorhees saga.  Despite the plot holes, lack of imaginative death sequences, and poor acting, all Jason fans must see it.  (It is also recommended for fans of ""Carrie,"" ""The Fury,"" ""Scanners,"" and other telekinetic horror films.)  Where else can you see Jason get beat up by a pretty girl.  Of course, a pretty girl like Lar Park-Lincoln can beat me up any day.

  Happy Friday the 13th!!!  Be sure to watch the ""Friday the 13th"" remake that was released today.  At last, Jason is back!!!!",1234483200,,2570,4.98581560283688
321855,5,6301094352,"** My apologies to Pumpkin Man who reviewed this movie with the same title, ""Carrie Vs. Jason."" I didn't realize it until recently. I have since changed the title of this review.

I must have seen all of these movies a dozen times or more. Out of all the Friday sequels that tried to do something different this one is the best of them.

This is the one where Jason gets his a$$ kicked big time like never before. True credit to Kane Hodder and Director John Carl Buechler for doing a fantastic job at giving Jason the edge he needed, the rotting flesh and exposed spine, the jagged teeth and an unmasking that lasted more than 3 minutes. Though heavily edited (as others have pointed out)it still made its point. However the ending would have worked had the original idea been in place.

Why must the MPAA butcher movies like this? At the time they were so worried about kids being scared or influenced by horror, even though parents were supposed to do their job of monitoring what kids saw; parents insisted on government stepping in and taking an active role, which explains why we see a rating at the beginning of each show (but doesn't explain why we see commercials at the bottom of the screen during the show!!), and to see this movie on TV is just a joke. Buy the DVD, buy the collection set, or wait for a revised edition to come out in several months, just don't catch it on Spike or some other lame channel. And many movies are coming to DVD unrated anyhow, so it doesn't matter, eh?

This movie is scarier than the last 2 before & after (meaning parts 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), and it seems to go back to the basics of the series while keeping it new and fresh. You can even see an appearance by William Butler whom fans would recognize as Tom in Savini's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00000K3TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>&nbsp;remake, & Ryan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leatherface/dp/B000099T3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leatherface</a>. And this is Kane's first appearance as Jason, the only actor to ever repeat a Jason role.

If you haven't seen this movie at least once I highly recommend renting it at the very least. But for real fans of the series you already know what I'm talking about because you own this already.",1232582400,,3182,5.9824175824175825
321856,4,6301094352,"FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 7:THE NEW BLOOD opened in theatres on Friday May 13, 1988 and Kane Hodder's first time playing the diabolical Jason Voorhees as well as the first movie to have a 7th sequel.

This terror flick by director John Carl Buecheler starts out with an intriguing beginning by showing us scenes from FRIDAY THE 13TH-PARTS 2,4, and 6; but they still don't tell us what ever happened to Tommy Jarvis after he drowned Jason(C.J. Graham) in PART VI, but I guess it was because Paramount figured the Tommy Jarvis character was getting old and tired and burned out and that it was time for a change, since Tommy Jarvis came out in FRIDAY THE 13TH-PARTS 4,5, and 6, which may have been part of the reason to give them the idea to replace Tommy Jarvis with Tina Shepherd(Lar-Park Lincoln) in PART 7.

After finishing up scenes from FRIDAY THE 13TH-Parts II, IV, and VI; it is months later after the conclusion of the previous sequel FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 6:JASON LIVES while an emotional tramautic 10-year old girl Tina Shephard(Jennifer Banko)unintentionally kills her abusive alcoholic father with her telekenesis after witnessing a heated argument between her parents.

Four years later; Tina(Lar Park Lincoln)is still struggling with the guilt over her father's death while her mother Amanda Shephard(Susan Blu)and her quack doctor Dr. Crews(Terry Kiser)take her from the asylum where she's been in and out of in hopes of treating Tina's overwhelming guilt when in fact Dr. Crews plans to study & exploit Tina's telekenetic capabilities by keeping her stress levels high as Dr. Crews has them convene at the Shephard's house at Crystal Lake where her father was killed to make sure Tina's emotions are at their peak, but Tina allows herself to be subjected to tests, despite her suspicions about Dr. Crews.

Meanwhile, some teenagers such as the brainy Maddy(Diana Barrows), perky Robin(Liz Kaitan), science-fiction geek Eddie(Jeffrey Bennett), socialite snob Melissa(Susan Jennifer Sullivan), preppy Russell(Larry Cox), Ben(Craig Thomas), Ben's girlfriend Kate(Diane Almeida)and the stoner David(Jon Renfield)are vacationing in the house next door to the Shephard's planning a surprise birthday party for their pal Michael as Tina friends with some of the kids to take strides to returning back to normal, but Melissa who has a crush on Tina's boyfriend Nick(Kevin Blair)deliberately tries to stir up trouble between Tina & Nick causing a great deal of tension.

After a stressful session with Dr. Crews, Tina believing she senses her father and uses her telekenetic powers to attempt to resurrect him from the bottom of the lake where he drowned, but ends up inadvertenly revive Jason from his incapacitation instead which results in Jason going back on another killing spree at Crystal Lake killing off all the co-stars one-by-one, with the exception of Tina and Nick.

Later at the conclusion, Tina finally resurrects her father from the lake wrapping Jason's chains around him & pulls the killer back in the lake just before Tina passes out.

This sequel also takes me all the way back to memory lane, especially since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VII was released in the movie theatres the same year that HALLOWEEN IV:THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART IV:THE DREAM MASTER were released, since FRIDAY THE 13TH:PART 7 was released in the Spring of 1988, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET:PART 4 was released in the Summer of 1988, and HALLOWEEN 4 was released in the Fall of 1988, which kind of made 1988 a phenomenal year for movies and sequels by the way.

As a matter of fact, that reminds me that the same people who did the special-effects for FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VII were the same people who did the special effects for HALLOWEEN IV, which were both done by ""Magical Media Industries"", but I still think the relentless Jason Voorhees was a stronger more brutal mass-murderer than the ghoulish Michael Myers was, despite the fact that the Jason Voorhees character was probably inspired by the Michael Myers character, since the original FRIDAY THE 13TH came out in the movie theaters 2 years later after original HALLOWEEN did, since Sean S. Cunningham's FRIDAY THE 13TH came out in the Summer of 1980 and John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN came out in the Fall of 1978, but Jason didn't make his real first appearance or start his first killing spree till FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2, which was released in the Spring of 1981 like HALLOWEEN 2 was in the Fall of 1981, but I still didn't think FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VII:THE NEW BLOOD was as good or as impressive as HALLOWEEN 4:THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS was.

FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 7:THE NEW BLOOD was filmed  in rural Southern Alabama near Bay Minette in the Fall of 1987 from October thru November of that year.",1227657600,,4778,4.968710888610763
321857,4,6301094352,"There's just no two ways about it - Kane Hodder was born to play Jason, and he is flat-out awesome in Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood.  Thank goodness for that because the story itself is pieced together with spit and gum, the ending is a little north of over the top, and virtually every death scene was mercilessly cut to satisfy the infernal blowhards at the MPAA.  I can understand the necessity for this cinematic butchery in terms of the theatrical release, as an X rating would have seriously cut into box office returns - I don't like it one bit, but I can understand it.  What I don't understand is why an unrated version of this film in all of its gory unrated glory has never been released on DVD.  What really sticks in my craw, though, is the fact that the VHS and DVD versions of the film have been cut even more than the theatrical release.  What Jason fan doesn't love the infamous sleeping bag kill (lovingly recreated in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-X-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B00006FI0R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason X (New Line Platinum Series)</a>)?  In the theatrical release, Jason whacked his victim six times against a tree; on the DVD, though, we only see one whack.  That's even more ridiculous than all of the heavy editing that had to be done to begin with.  You can go up to the very point of pornography on television now, yet all our fragile little minds supposedly can't handle watching a fictitious killer slam a body (encased in a sleeping bag, no less) six times against a tree.  What a total crock.  We really ought to be organizing protests against this type of nanny government censorship tyranny.  Fortunately, we can finally see some of these deleted scenes (including the complete sleeping bag kill), with commentary, on the Bonus Features disk that comes with the Friday the 13th Box Set, but all we get are the raw cuts sans music, post-editing, etc. (and that's a long way away from the real thing).

As I'm sure everyone remembers,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-VI-Jason-Lives/dp/B00005NG6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th, Part VI - Jason Lives</a>, ended with Jason weighted down in the depths of Crystal Lake.  An indeterminate amount of time has passed since then (director John Carl Buechler has stated elsewhere that it was ten years) - enough for a little girl who sort of accidentally on purpose killed her abusive father there at the lake to mature into a fairly attractive yet messed-up-in-the-head teenager and for the town to dump Green Forest and revert back to the name Crystal Lake.  Jason is remarkably well-preserved - sure his clothes are pretty ragged and he does have several areas of exposed ribs and spine - but he's still in one piece.  After all this time, though, nothing's going to bring him back to life short of a troubled teenager with telekinetic powers who does it accidentally - and, amazingly enough, that's just what happens.  Enter Tina Shepard (Lar Park-Lincoln), whose doctor has brought her back to the site in an effort to release her of the pent-up guilt she has been dealing with ever since her father's death (which pretty much was her fault).  Dr. Crews (Terry Kiser) apparently took the Hypocritical Oath rather than the Hippocratic Oath, however, as he is more interested in exploiting her for her powers than in helping her - she can move things with her mind in moments of extreme stress.

So, basically, Jason is freed from his watery grave and quickly sets out killing everyone in sight, with a houseful of partying teenagers making for particular good pickings.  Nothing new, and certainly nothing extraordinary there - except this time it's Kane Hodder behind the mask, taking Jason to new heights of amoral evil.  The final scenes of this movie move dangerously close to being just plain silly - but at least they do demonstrate Hodder's Jason's ""never say die"" attitude.  His quest for blood now knows no bounds, and he really puts his heart into all the carnage like never before.  The old Jason killed because that is what he was put on this earth to do; Kane Hodder's Jason kills because he freakin' gets off on it.  Once he got his hands on a machete, the old Jason would start using it immediately.  When the new Jason lays hold of a machete, he chooses to kill his next victim with his bare hands - and when he decides to throw someone through a window, he forever more hurls them through it, and he does it with just one hand.  That is dedication, my friends.  That's the hands-own kind of personal responsibility that made this country great.  This is the Jason that might - might, I say - give Michael Meyers a good fight (although my money's still on Michael) - and that's why this is probably my second favorite Friday the 13th film.",1225843200,,4887,4.9352869352869355
321858,2,6301094352,"This is the seventh entry in the long running series and by now Jason has gotten away with enough murders to make any other serial killer jealous. Too bad all of his murders in this movie were very tame. But if you want to see alot of cut footage go to YOUTUBE to see what you missed out on. Type in Friday the 13th uncut and it will bring you to about 6 minutes of spliced together scenes from part 7.

This time Jason meets a willing and able adversary in a girl with special powers. She is a troubled young woman because of her powers. She has also just met a boy that she likes. So she has plenty of things to deal with. We soon see what the girl is able to do with mind control. She is also unaware of the naughty intentions of her pyschologist. You just know that she will have some kind of confrontation with Jason sometime in this movie.

There are a group of partyers in this movie that are living next door. You can just tell that they will be easy targets for Jason right away. Jason is again resurrected from the dead and all hell breaks loose. He soon goes on a rampage murdering people all along the way.

My main complaint about the movie was the fact that not alot happened in this movie until the final confrontation which was really good. But up until then the murders aren't very gory. On YOUTUBE you can see what was cut out of the movie even though it was all pretty tame. You can see the pyschologist getting his stomach cut into with the weed wacker. You see a guy get a machete to the face. You see pretty much every kill. And six minutes worth at that.

Back to the final act. This was definately the best part of the movie. The girl with special powers takes it to Jason. Jason battles it out with her and takes it like a man. Who will defeat who? Will Jason meet his match yet again? Will he be buried for good? How many sequels were there after this?

My advice again is to check out YOUTUBE to see what was cut out. They also have some cut scenes from Fridays 1, 4, & 6 as well but it doesn't really amount to much with those. Seeing those cut scenes make you wonder if they will ever release this movie uncut. The scenes aren't really that gory which makes you wonder why they were taken out in the first place.

It's different in the sense that they add the supernatural element of 'telekinesis' to the story arc of Tina Shepard. Tina is a lot like Sissy Spacek from 'Carrie' she can move things with her mind and see into the future. Jason Voorhees has never looked better. He looks like a monster with a cracked hockey mask. Seven years after accidentally killing her dad, Tina is sent to the Crystal Lake cabins for the weekend to receive help from Dr. Crews (played by Terry Kiser from the Weekend at Bernie's movies) When Tina becomes stressed and furious, she unintentionally awakens Jason from his watery grave. Jason begins killing off the teens at the cabin across the lake from Tina. When he kills Tina's mom, it becomes personal and Tina decides to take him on face to face!

321912,3,6301094352,"The New Blood is a fan favorite among Friday the 13th fans, but quite honestly I never fully got the appeal of this movie. No I wasn't expecting a masterpiece of filmmaking. It's Friday the 13th part VII and I got what I expected. Though for a part 7 this is better made than most movies with that number after it. The New Blood delivers on what it's meant to. Violence and nudity, but sadly the gore is lacking thanks to the MPAA and Paramount refusing to give us an uncut DVD. Even though I do enjoy The New Blood I never got the full appeal this movie seems to have on a lot of the fans.

I will give this movie credit though for trying to be more than just the run of the mill stalk and slash movie. By the time this movie came out the slasher flick was starting to die out with the exception of the franchises. But let's face it everything that could have been explored in these movies were already done, but The New Blood does attempt at more character development and actually sort of plays out like a drama at times.

One of the original ideas for The New Blood was for it to be Freddy Vs Jason, but at the time Paramount was doing the Friday the 13th movies and New Line the A Nightmare on Elm Street movies and when a deal couldn't be reached it was dropped and The New Blood became a continuation of just the Jason character.

The screenplay was written by Daryl Haney & Manuel Fidello, but from what I can gather Manuel Fidello isn't even a real person. It was a name used by another write during rewrites. The screenplay by Haney wasn't bad. It features the typical characters we see in these movies. You name the clichd character The New Blood features them. But what does help set this movie a part at times is the plot with Tina Shepard played by Lar-Park Lincoln, Amanda Shepard played by Susan Blu and Dr. Crews played by Terry Kiser.

There's a big element of drama early on with those characters and in some ways it does feel out of place, but it also actually works rather well. That subplot also really helps The New Blood be a little original. The scenes are mostly well written, the acting is fairly good and director John Carl Buechler does a fantastic job on the setups of the scene. Those are the strongest scenes of the movie, but the 2nd half becomes the particular stalk and slash movie with Jason just walking around killing everybody.

Director John Carl Buechler knows what the fans wanted and he delivers on that big time. By this point there was no mystery surrounding Jason so having him hide in the shadows wouldn't work. The audience wants to see Jason and Buechler delivers on that. The fans wanna see Jason kill often and in brutal ways and again Buechler delivers. His shot selections are excellent as well; he really knows how to capture Jason on camera. The suspense level though is low for the most part, but that isn't the fault of John Carl Buechler.

Being the director I assume he is the natural person to blame, but it was the writing. I don't know about anyone else, but when I dislike the characters I can't get that sense of suspense or tension. Outside of Tina, Amanda Shepard and Nick played by Kevin Blair, all the characters are worthless, obnoxious and quite annoying. You wanna see Jason dispatch of every single one of them. Therefore in the chase scenes for me the suspense lacks since I don't care about the characters. The movies I find most suspenseful are the ones where I liked or semi liked the characters.

There are some nice touches though of suspense at times though, when Jason is stalking Maddy played by Diana Barrows was one of the more solid scenes of the movie when it comes to suspense. I think Buechler is one of the better directors of the series. He knew what the fans wanted and tried to deliver on that. But when you have faceless victims at least for me it's kind of hard to feel the suspense.

Giving a better script I believe John Carl Buechler could have possibly made the best Friday the 13th movie. He knows what the fans want and again he knows how to capture Jason on film. The 2nd half the writing is quite weak due to the very annoying characters, but Buechler knows how to work it and makes The New Blood a far better movie than it should have been.

The New Blood is often dubbed Jason Vs Carrie, since Tina has the power of telekinesis. That does make for a fun time in the final act when Jason has his showdown with Tina. It also helps that is strays from the typical slasher movie conventions. The scenes really could have come out terrible, but the actors and John Carl Buechler really sell it and make it very enjoyable.

Tina makes for a strong and likeable heroine and she is probably the best developed character of the series or at least in the top 3. Too bad her character never came back. There are many directions that could have gone with her. I also really liked Melissa played by Susan Jennifer Sullivan. Any scene she is in really is a lot of fun. She's hot, but really snotty and stuck up. Her death is one of my favorites. Jason puts an axe to her head and flings her across the room.

The stand out though has to be Terry Kiser as Dr. Crews. The character has no redeeming qualities. Instead of helping Tina he's out to exploit her and he's nothing more than a coward, but the character is so much fun to watch.

The New Blood also marked the debut for Kane Hodder as Jason and he brings a lot of life into the character. Jason is a walking killing machine by this point, but Hodder is able to bring more to the role and do a great job with his movements. Playing a role like Jason isn't as easy as people think. Sure you can throw anybody behind the mask and have them walk around and kill people and the audience will be happy, but Kane Hodder really does bring a lot to the role.

The New Blood is legendary among fans for the cuts made by the MPAA; all the Friday the 13th movies have suffered cuts, but The New Blood was the most butchered. Like I said earlier John Carl Buechler knew what the fans wanted and he tries to deliver that, but the MPAA put a halt on that. The kill scenes are the best and worst of the series. This is a slasher movie and people wanna see Jason doing his thing and boy does he ever. But thanks to the MPAA these great kill scenes now look weak.

The past Friday the 13th movies even with the edits that had to be made still look good, but the same can't be said for The New Blood. The edits are very easy to see and it's very frustrating to watch. We have this great set up on the kills and once they begin to happen there is a cut. Paramount could have saved the day in the DVD age and give the fans the uncut version, but they refused. There is always an excuse with them. They were never proud of these movies yet from 1980-1989 they made 8 of them. They won't sell off the rights, but when there is any money that can still be made they cash right in on them.

After the success of Freddy Vs Jason, Paramount put out a lame and rushed boxed set and if you have that you can see the kill scenes uncut as part as an extra feature. The footage is out there since it's on the set why not restore it in the movie? Fans would by it for sure and I'm willing to bet even if their was a drop in quality due to any print damage the fans wouldn't mind.

Overall The New Blood was a good entry in the series while it might lack the suspense of past Friday the 13th movie it still turns out to be a fun ride and I still believe given a better script John Carl Buechler could have possibly made the best Friday the 13th movie, but for what it's worth he made a movie a lot better than it should have been.",1198195200,,7642,4.23113854595336

Kane Hodder takes over the role of Jason, and plays it with the customary viciousness and gusto.  Lar Park Lincoln stars as the heroine Tina who is taken by her opportunistic psychiatrist to the site of her father's death, which happens to be Crystal Lake.  We get the usual cookie cutter assortment of murderable teens, the heroine's mother, and of course the shady doctor, played nicely by character actor Terry Kiser.  Director John Carl Buechler keeps things moving, but reportedly fought with the rating board to keep from getting an X, so the gore is downplayed.  The usual variety of deaths occur.

A troubled teenage girl with telekenesis accidentally raises Jason Voorhees up from his watery grave that he was put in at the end of Part 6 and this pretty much restarts the mayhem and terror at Camp Crystal Lake. I thoroughly agree with one other reviewer on here that the girl that Jason's after in this movie bares far too much resemblance to Carrie. Gore is plentiful, As is sex and nudity, But this movie generally lacks interest and appeal. Definitely amongst the worst of the heap.",1189987200,2,598,4.704761904761905

The Problem: The director didn't know how to tell this story properly.  Maybe the screenwriter was lazy and figured he could slap the story together and people would be sold.  Not in this case.  The movie comes off too camp.  As if it's supposed to be scary yet silly at the same time.  The acting really brought down first and foremost, the plotholes are an after thought when you figure the most convincing person in the movie doesn't utter a single word of dialogue.

However, I did enjoy this and still love it when the horrific plot hole of an ending glares up.

I recommend this, although I'll probably be kicked for making this recommendation.",1189036800,,917,4.410714285714286
321916,1,6301094352,"Calling Friday the 13th part VII:  The New Blood an unnecessary sequel is overstating the obvious, but Paramount Pictures needs your money.  John Carl Buechler directs the first movie featuring Kane Hodder in the role of Jason Voorhees.  He plays Jason in each subsequent sequel, but not in Freddy vs. Jason.  Buechler is capable of handling the direction of this film in the same way a monkey is capable of throwing his excrement.  Buechler is a natural at producing films like this.  After all, he did bring us Troll and Ghoulies III:  Ghoulies Go to College.

Tina Shepard saw her father bullying her mother about, and she got upset enough to reveal that she has telekinetic powers.  So she killed her dad and made him drown at the bottom of Crystal Lake.  Years later, Tina begins to have her powers studied by a doctor who just so happens to be located on that same lake.  She attempts to raise her father from his watery grave but as it turns out she wakes up Jason instead.  Jason kills a bunch of people and then Tina confronts him and they fight.  She ends up resurrecting her father after all of this and he takes Jason back into the lake with him.  Her father looks to be in surprisingly great shape for a dead guy who has been underwater for several years. Good for him.

In short, this was basically Jason vs. Carrie.  There is nothing really good to say here other than to mention a few of the deaths.  Obviously it is hysterical when Jason kills the girl in the sleeping bag but given the relatively serious theme of the film, I just couldn't enjoy as much as I would've had it been in part 6 or when it was redone in Jason X.  There seemed to be a genuine effort here to make a decent movie and that just serves to make The New Blood even worse.  It is definitely one of the worst movies in the series.",1185321600,3,1818,4.341246290801187

This movie is worth the price alone just for how well Voorhees looks in the movie, this is definitely my favorite look by far. His spine and rib cage are clearly visible, so I guess it goes to show people what spending too much time in the water can do to your skin. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the series and this is a great film to see if you have never seen any other movie in the series, this is the one! The only problem with the movie is that the death scenes are cut and not up to standards of some other movies, so that is the reason I gave it a four star rating instead of five.",1169683200,2,749,3.9342105263157894

The script is terrible and wastes the psychic spin completely. The spin with the psychic girl could have been done well but it is so poorly executed that one wonders if this movie was done as a high-school project. The acting is downright awful and the actors sound like they had like been to Hollywood upstairs acting school. The music though is the worst schlock I have heard in a long time and is absolutely atrocious. I love the tacky and cheap looking 80's clothes, the even worst hair does and the cheap special effects that even looked cheap back when this movie was done.

The answer is no, only if your an obsessed Friday the 13th fan.  This time round, Jason is unchained from his watery grave following his last duel with Tommy, accidentally released by a girl's telekinetic powers.  Tina, her mother and her psychiatrist have decided to stay at Camp Crystal for a psychology session.  Unbeknownst to Tina, her doctor is aware of her powers and intends to use them for his own gain.

However, there are bigger fish to fry with the newly awakened Jason. It is up to Tina to put Jason back in his place once and for all.  This film saw the introduction of Kane Hodder, who, in fairness does a great Jason.  But the series has run its course at this stage with so many plotholes it doesn't bear thinking about. As well as this, the film is incredibly tedious and the jumps are few and far between.  Not a worthy sequel which would have been better off not made.",1145232000,3,1007,4.483516483516484
321970,2,6301094352,"In ""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood,"" we get to hear a narrator tell us the backstory. I don't know who the narrator is; the credits don't mention him. It sounds like Donald Sutherland, but I bet it's not.

Mr. Narrator reminds us of what has happened to this point in the saga, ending with the fact that at the end of Part 6, Jason was weighted down and drowned in Crystal Lake. Mr. Narrator informs us that ""people forget he's down there.""

This is just stupid. A man responsible for nearly 100 murders in the space of 10 years does not just disappear from public memory. Furthermore, when Tommy Jarvis drowned the bastard in Part 6, surely the cops and scientists would have then retrieved him, picked him apart, and studied him. His hockey mask would be on eBay. There would be an A&E ""Biography"" episode about him. People don't just ""forget he's down there.""

But the forgetting is necessary for the story to move forward. It will be helpful if you, the viewer, have forgotten a few things, too. For example, remember how in Part 6, Crystal Lake changed its name to Forest Green in order to escape its bloody past? Yeah, go ahead and forget that, because it's Crystal Lake again now.

After Mr. Narrator spins his yarn, there's a prologue (which takes place on Friday the 13th -- CREEEE-PY!) in which a little girl who looks like the ""Poltergeist"" little girl accidentally uses her psychic powers to kill her dad. Surely we all have made errors like this at some point in our lives. It occurs outside the family's house on Crystal Lake, mere feet from where Jason is chained to the lake bottom, ""forgotten"" by the locals.

Next thing you know, it's several years later. The little girl is grown up and named Tina, and she and her Markie Post lookalike mother have returned to the cabin after apparently having been gone awhile. They've returned because Tina's weird psychic/telekinetic abilities have made her a bit freakish, and a psychiatrist named Dr. Crews wants to ""help"" her, which really means he wants to use her power for his own gain. (Dr. Crews, by the way, is played by Terry Kiser, who also played the corpse in ""Weekend at Bernie's."" This is an actor whose career consists only of

low points.)

So while he's trying to get Tina to harness her powers, Tina goes out on the dock and tries to use them to summon back her dead father. Instead, she accidentally summons Jason; whoops! He gets right to work and starts killing teen-agers, who are conveniently located in an adjacent cabin, having a surprise party for someone who doesn't show up because Jason has killed him. It makes you wonder what Jason would do if he were revived on a weekend when no one was anywhere near Crystal Lake. Would he bother hiking into town to kill some folks in a diner? Catch a Greyhound to the next major city? Or just hang out in the woods, waiting for someone to show up?

The interesting thing about this movie is that it was directed by John Carl Buechler, whose credits also include ""Ghoulies 3: Ghoulies Go to College.""

The second interesting thing about this movie is that it features the return of the unsettling Daisy Duke shorts that men in the 1980s apparently wore ALL THE TIME, if the ""Friday the 13th"" movies are to be believed.

The third interesting thing about this movie is that at last, there is something different to do about Jason. In the past, victims have battled him by running, stumbling, and screaming a lot. Usually they give up pretty easily and just let themselves be killed, often because they want out of the movie. But now we have Tina, whose telekinetic powers are far more effective than mere knives or screaming. Good to see someone putting a little effort into things.

Goodness knows the writer, director and actors didn't expend much effort. We won't bother mentioning that the acting and dialogue are atrocious, like they always are. If we don't mention it, maybe you'll forget.",1141948800,7,3928,4.621233859397417

  Tina is now a teenager (Lar Park Lincoln). With her mother and Dr. Crews (Terry Kiser) they come back to their old house to trey and help Tina.  That night, she goes back to the pier and thinking her father is still down in the water, her powers surface and they are strong enough to resurface Jason.

321975,4,6301094352,"Did anyone ever think that a ""Carrie""-type individual would be in a face-off against our good ole pal Jason Voorhees? Nope, I never even thought it would happen. But then again, horror, when it's good, is supposed to throw you off. Not that this does, but it's actually a nice change from the typical teens get killed by masked madman. Instead of having a fully human rival, Jason's facing off against a Carrie-type young lady who has telekinetic powers...and knows how to use 'em. This was the first FRIDAY THE 13TH to feature the new man behind the mask, Kane Hodder, who has made Jason look more menacing and stronger.

Picking up from the events of the last film, Jason is awakened when supernatural powers resurrect him from his watery grave and he once again is alive and ready to annihilate anyone in his way. Luckily, our heroine has special powers, and the kids in this movie aren't as sex-driven, yet still one ""estrogen"" fueled character has to exist (they have them in all of the Friday the 13th movies) and she can get annoying. While on a vacation at a cabin house in good ole Camp Crystal Lake, Tina and her mother, along with Tina's therapist, who's been trying to help her since coping with the accidental death of her father (or was it accidental, or intentional?), are trying to get away from the stresses of the city. But with Jason alive once more, the murders again begin to happen thanks to our hapless hockey-masked maniac and things once again go from bad to worse, as most of the teens are slaughtered one by one. But the climax of the film was actually quite entertaining. While Jason stands face to face, from a distance, with Tina facing off against him, she knocks his mask off, knocks him into the water, and then resurrects her father to once again put Jason back in his watery grave...but is he truly dead? This is FRIDAY THE 13TH, of course he is not dead...but then again, since when has he ever been dead?

Nonetheless, this seventh entry would ride into the nadir of the series, PART VIII.

Stunts Coordinated By Kane Hodder. Score Composed By Harry Manfredini and Fred Mollin. Directed By John Carl Buechler. (R) For Violence, Mild Gore, Profanity, Drug Use, Nudity and Sexual Content; 88m.; 1988.

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: The sixth sequel to the immensely popular ""Friday the 13th"" series arrives as young Tina Shepard (Lar Park Lincoln) and her mother Amanda (Susan Blu) travel back to their family cabin on Crystal Lake with Tina's psychologist Dr. Crews (Terry Kiser). There, they hope to help Tina overcome her mysterious mental blocks (and psychic abilities) relating to the death of her father (John Otrin) when she was just a little girl. But when Tina tries to resurrect her father one fateful evening, she winds up unleashing the full fury of Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) who slices his way through another set of vacationing teens before enduring a final showdown against Shepard herself. Special effects make-up man turned director John Carl Buechler adds a lot of his own style to this film and most of it works well. Sadly, the inherent problem of generic stereotypes plagues most of the cast, though they do their best to overcome the situation. Susan Jennifer Sullivan is one of the few supporting players who shines, bringing believability to the snotty, upper class Melissa. However she's the only real standout outside of the three key players of the film. Terry Kiser is good in his role of the pompous psychologist but he displays little of the talent that would carry him to super stardom one year later as a comedic corpse (""Weekend at Bernie's""). Lar Park Lincoln is nice to look at but she seems a little stiff as Tina. Her transformation into the telekinetic heroine also lacks the conviction her role necessitates. Kevin Blair is the best of the new bunch, turning in an even, boy next door performance as Nick. ""Friday"" fans will note that critically acclaimed Kane Hodder's first outing as Jason is in this film. Nevertheless, it's hard not to make comparisons between him and ""Part 3"" star Richard Brooker who sonorously served as Hodder's inspiration for the role. On the other side of the camera, Harry Manfredini turns in a wonderful, if not slightly repetitive, musical backdrop and Jason's facial make-up is the best the series has seen. The make-up even honors ""The Final Chapter"" by leaving Jason with only one eye, after Corey Feldman whacked the hell out of his left eye with a machete at the end of the fourth film. Trivia buffs take note: Kevin Blair, like Renee Jones (from ""Friday VI""), would go on to co-star on the ""Days of Our Lives"" soap opera. He would portray Dr. Craig Wesley, credited under his real name Kevin Spirtas. Overall, this is a solid entry into the long running series. There are a few missteps along the way, some of the dialogue is a bit corny and some of the film's middle section seems drawn out. But for a cinema sideshow that was quickly approaching a decade's worth of terror, Jason fans couldn't ask for anything more entertaining than this.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.85:1 widescreen presentation that adorns this DVD seems a tad fuzzy from time to time but is otherwise clear and realistic. As for sound quality, it's a blessing to finally have a ""Friday"" film mastered in a well-separated, readily defined 5.1 surround sound. It's not the thunderous, expansive surround that accompanies other horror classics, but it's a major step forward from the mono and 2.0 tracks that have graced previous entries in the series. There is also an English stereo track, a French mono track and English subtitles for this film. The subtitles are yellow, easy to read and have been placed within the frame of the movie. The front cover for this DVD is another attempt by Paramount to create something new and original. While seeing Jason standing on a yellow background has some merit, it can't hold a candle to the original video release cover which featured half a woman's face and half a hockey mask combined by a knife dripping blood. Part of that original video release cover is used on the back cover of this DVD (although not entirely in its original form). The other half can be found on the one sheet insert which also displays the fifteen chapter stops for this ninety minute film. The disc has been painted with a replica of the DVD's front cover which has been changed from a yellow background to a completely orange-hued photograph. Paramount skimmed the special features on this release more than any of the other ""Friday"" films. The reason? There's not even a theatrical trailer coupled with the feature presentation. Nothing. Nada. Zip. I know there's a trailer for this film out there somewhere, but you won't find it here.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Paramount has never been known for plying their releases with additional footage, let alone hiding anything on the disc. You're more likely to electrocute Jason Voorhees with your mind than you are of finding hidden easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Sandra (Heidi Kozak) strips naked for a late night swim and the viewer is treated to numerous shots of her gorgeous behind, finally seeing every inch of her in a few underwater cuts. Observant viewers are treated to a very brief glimpse of Kate's (Diane Almeida) left breast while she makes love to Ben (Craig Thomas) in the back of a van. She then has a nice upskirt which shows off her little white panties as she moves to the front seat. Robin (Elizabeth Kaitan) shows off her resplendent breasts a few times after making love with David (Jon Renfield). The only real miscue in this film was not having Melissa (Susan Jennifer Sullivan) bare any fraction of her fantastic form.

THE GORE REPORT: There is a bit of blood when one of the girls finds she's been sitting next to a severed head. There's also some nice make-up work on one of the girls who takes a party favor through the eye and one unfortunate guy who gets sliced in the face with a machete. There's also small amounts of gore through many of the other death scenes but none of it adds up to anything memorable. It's been said that the filmmakers had to cut numerous scenes of gore from this one in order to avoid an ""X"" rating. Obviously, they cut too much.

SAY AGAIN: ""Eddie, where are you going?"" - Melissa (Susan Jennifer Sullivan). ""To take a cold shower. I got a date with a soap-on-a-rope."" - Eddie (Jeff Bennett) after being rejected.

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. Horror was having its last great hurrah during the late eighties and this was one of the best examples the genre produced during that time period. Excellent make-up, honest effort in the story, good casting, a climactic finale. All the right elements were present, and though this wasn't as laudable as some of its predecessors, it was the final ""Friday the 13th"" film that stuck to the original format of the series. After this one, too many new ideas and exaggerated concepts would be introduced to ""liven up"" (i.e. decimate) the routine.

Young Tina has the gift of telekinesis, which is the ability to move objects w/ her mind. And in the most creative way of bringing Jason back to life in any of the sequels, she accidentally uses her power to resurrect him instead of her father. The stereotypical teen cast is found here (the easy girl, the weed guy, the weirdo, the insecure girl, the studly nice guy, and some african-americans), and they fall one by one.

322040,3,6301094352,"Well, 1st of all, I'd like to start off by saying that Jason looked his best in this film. If you notice, his appearence changes in every Friday film (aside from the 1st one & the lame Part 5, cause HE'S NOT EVEN IN PART 5!!!) Also, this is Kane Hodder's 1st time playing Jason... & he's the best of all of them. He kinda gives Jason a ""personality."" 2nd of all... in my opinion, ""Part 7: The New Blood"" ends up being kinda funny instead of scary. For one, Jason kills almost every person with a different yard tool or whatever. (hahaha). I like how he just appears with them... the metal spike... the knife... the ax... whatever... I guess they were just laying around waiting for him to use them or something, lol! And the sleeping bag scene where he slams that girl up against the tree, now THAT was funny! And it was kinda creative too... also, I thought it would have been funny if the guy who smokes weed had been smoking a joint & offered Jason a hit! Lol! Another thing:  when he's chasing Dr. Crews (Hey, its Bernie from ""Weekend at Bernies!"" Hahahahaha!!!) through the woods-- Notice how ""Bernie"" is running away from Jason at full speed & Jason just kinds walks after him & somehow stays only a few steps behind him & then catches up with him. Then, ""Bernie"" thinks he looses Jason... who, even though they are out in the MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, suddenly appears with a weed-eater or something. Yea, I guess somebody must've left it WWWAAAYYY out there-- how convienent, lol-- & then kills ""Bernie"" with it. Lol, I thought it would have been funny if at this point, they did a ""Friday the 13th at Bernies"" or something... Jason thinks he killed him, but his body keeps popping up around him... lmfao! HHAHAHAHA!!! Ok... anyway, later after this, that Melissa girl (who is a real b@#$% in this movie) opens the door to find Jason standing there with an ax. Instead of running, or even screaming, she just kinds stands there & lets him ax her in the face. Hahaha... it this kinda stuff that makes it funny instead of scary, but nonetheless entertaining.

322041,3,6301094352,"Friday The 13th VII begins with a handy intro recapping the previous 6 installments, so you don't have to waste your life watching them.  Jason, now a zombie, is freed by a young woman with telekinetic powers.  She has returned to Camp Crystal Lake (with her mother and a creep of a psychologist) after accidentally killing her father years ago (by sending him to the bottom of the infamous lake).  When she returns, she acidentally frees Jason (who was chained to the bottom of the lake in VI) who of course goes on yet another killing spree. Fortunately for Jason, there also happens to be a houseful of sex-crazed teens nearby, for him to whack.  This is where it becomes morbidly amusing, as Jason kills each person with a different yard tool.

The young woman finally realises there is a killer loose and attacks Jason with her mind powers.  Jason is apparently electocuted and the threat is over (not!).  The woman and her new boyfriend now must do battle with Jason in the confines of a small house (some actual suspense!).  Jason's face is revealed again (he's now a cool monster in the ranks of Frankenstein and the like!) and he is virtually unstoppable.  The young woman's father rises again, and pulls Jason below into the lake, in a rather weak climax.

Kane Hodder begins here his 4 entry run as the infamous killer.  Hodder's Jason is a muscular brute who finds sinister delight in finishing off his victems (escpecially in VIII).

Jason doing battle with another powerful foe reminded me a little of the Godzilla series.  At the time of the film, a Freddy Vs Jason film was being tossed about, but fell through.  Therefore, Jason fought a Carrie clone.

Though not extremely enjoyable, I thought my time was not nearly as wasted with this film as it was with the previous episodes (of course, maybe this one seemed good due to the previous films' poor quality).",1110153600,,1877,4.679878048780488

Obviously struggling for ideas they settled on a girl with telekineses powers to be the heroine to take on Jason. As a child her father was killed in lake, and she blames herself, it has traumatised her and her shrink has decided all these years later to take her back to the lake and confront her demons. But he's not interested in that, he has his own agenda. But everything comes to a halt when Jason comes back from his watery grave. But wonder woman has her magical powers to defend herself with... the movie is not too bad. I have watched it a few times. But I don't consider it to be great, or the best they could have made it.

322044,5,6301094352,"In 1986's, Friday The 13th Part 6: Jason Lives, Tommy Jarvis had finished off Jason, by drowning him at the bottom of the lake at Camp Crystal Lake, the only way to defeat Jason once and for all. Tommy had claimed that it was finally over. But Tommy was wrong.

  In 1988, after getting more cravings from the fans, director John Carl Buechler had given us fans, Friday The 13th Part 7: The New Blood.

  Friday The 13th Part 7: The New Blood starts off with the Shepard family. John Shepard (played by John Otrin) is drunk again, where he and his wife, Amanda Shepard (played by Susan Blu) are arguing, leading John into smacking Amanda straight across the face, where their 10-year-old daughter, Tina, after witnessing John's actions, runs off into a rowboat and drifts into the lake. John tries to run after her, but he is too late. He tries to call her back, as he apologizes, but Tina is nowhere even near feeling up to forgiving her father. Tina screams out, ""You hit mom again. I hate you. I wish you were dead"". Suddenly, just by looking at the pier in which John stands on, Tina, with her telekinetic powers, accidentally break the pier, which crashes into the lake, causing the death of John Shepard. Tina screams out, ""DADDY!"" She had never meant to say that she wished her father dead. That is something every child says to their parents when they are frustrated.

  Tina (played by Lar Park Lincoln), now at the age of 17, wakes up in her mother's car. They are headed back to their cabin at Camp Crystal Lake. Tina has been in and out of mental hospitals for her guilt over her father's death, as well as her telekinetic powers. Dr. Crews (played by Terry Kiser, in his pre-Weekend At Bernie's days) has decided to spend the weekend with Amanda and Tina, in order to help Tina. But what the ladies do not know is that Dr. Crews is not out to help Tina, but out to exploit her. Next-door are ten teenagers. The ten teenagers are Nick (played by Kevin Blair), Sondra (played by Heidi Kozak), Russell (played by Larry Cox), Kate (played by Diane Almeida), Ben (played by Craig Thomas), Eddie (played by Jeff Bennett), David (played by Jon Renfield), Maddy (played by Diana Barrows), Robin (played by Elizabeth Kaitan), & Melissa (played by Susan Jennifer Sullivan). They have moved in next-door to throw a surprise birthday for Nick's cousin, Michael.

  Dr. Crews has Tina getting started on her telekinetic powers, by having telekinetically move a matchbook. She tries, but can't, for her powers work only when her emotions are at their highest peak. Dr. Crews screams at her, causing her to move the matchbook across the table. She gets up and walks away. She walks down to the lake and tries to bring back her father, but accidentally brings back Jason (played by Kane Hodder).

  That night, Michael (played by William Butler) and his girlfriend, Jane (played by Staci Greason) are on their way to the cabin, but their car breaks down. As they begin to walk, Jason kills them.

  Nick arrives at Tina's and invites her to the party. She meets everyone there, including the b*tch, Melissa. Tina then has a vision of Jason killing Michael. She runs out in hysterics.

  The next morning, Nick and Tina are having a pleasant conversation. Tina finds herself falling for Nick, as Nick is for Tina. They share a brief kiss, after Tina explains to Nick about her father's death and how it sort of messed up her head.

  That night, while trying to throw Michael another party, hoping he will show up, Jason stumbles upon the kids and kills each and every one of them, leaving only Tina, Nick, and Melissa. Tina has run off after Amanda Shepard had found out about Dr. Crews' plans to commit her. Amanda and Dr. Crews set out to find Tina, but they find Jason instead, who kills them instantly.

  Tina runs back to her house, where Nick and Melissa wait for her. Melissa, turns out to be even more of a b*tch then we thought, for she shows know care for what is going on until Jason axes her in the face. With her telekinetic powers, Tina breaks Jason's hockey mask. Instead of seeing the usual mongoloid face that we have seen since the first film, we now see an almost skeletal-like zombie creature, since Jason has been killed so many times. After a brief battle, Tina sets the place on fire, which is due for an explosion. She and Nick make a run for it. The house explodes, but Tina and Nick are safe. Well, not exactly. Jason made it out of the explosion. He tries to knock off Tina, but with her telekinetic powers, she brings her father's ghost up from the lake. He grabs Jason and pulls him back down into the lake, leaving Tina and Nick in safety.

  This film gets all praise from me. It seems like the director wanted a Friday film where can bring Jason Voorhees face-to-face with a young Carrie. Another amazing sequel that you should watch before you set out on your long-anticipated camping trip.",1106784000,,4921,4.552780930760499
322085,3,6301094352,"Interestingly enough, I heard this film was originally supposed to be the first of the proposed crossovers between Mr. Voorhees and Mr. Krueger, but due to some problems I guess the filmakers instead opted for a clone of Carrie White.

Anyway, in the latest of the series which has been a real guilty pleasure for me, a girl with psychic powers, who killed her father by accident when she was a child, winds up unearthing Mr. V, now played by Kane Hodder, who's been taking a nap or something while spending all that time under the lake.  The years being under the water for real this time around cause him to now look like a completely decomposed zombie.  His clothes are all ripped up, his bones are showing through his skin, and his mask is missing a bottom chunk, revealing a bit of his now zombie-fied mouth, something I actually thought was a pretty nice effect.  Speaking of Jason being a zombie, I just have to say watch out, because when the film goes to show him without his mask, I just have to say he is one UGLY !  Well, goes without saying, pretty much everything else is just standard fare, acting, eh, story, eh, etc etc.  No better or worse than the rest of the Paramount series.  Also, animation fans, watch for an appearance by Jeff Bennett(the guy who does the voice of Johnny Bravo, Brooklyn from Gargoyles, and Dexter's dad from Dexter's Laboratory) as a sci-fi geek.",1099699200,2,1389,4.532

322087,5,6301094352,"With Jason Voorhees how having evolved into a nearly unstoppable monster, ""The New Blood"" introduces a new adversary for the masked one in the form of a mentally-shaky telepathic teenage girl.  Not as full-throtle horror as ""Jason Lives"" but sexier, inventive, and perhaps the most visually spectacular chapter to this point, ""F13 VII"" succeeds in every sense of the word.  Also features one of the greatest climaxes in Friday history, in a series where even the weaker chapters almost invariably pick up markedly toward the end (except for 1 particular chapter, which I've already chastised too much in previous reviews, to the point where I'm starting to feel uncomfortably Scrooge-like).  Fantastic special effects, worthy of Oscar condsideration, although I think the Academy usually doesn't consider movies like to this due to political correctness, especially in the 80s, when the politicians's yammering was at its shrillest.  That shouldn't detract from the excellent work that went into making ""The New Blood"" one of the technically-soundest Fridays, and one of the best chapters overall in a great series.

  As an interesting sidenote: the year this came out, four other legendary and long-running horror lines also put out outstanding entries: ""Hellbound"" (the secon ""Hellraiser""), the first ""Child's Play"", ""Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers"", and the fourth ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" movie (""The Dream Master"").  All among the top ten horror movies of 1988 (one of horror's greatest years), and all extremely recommended, as is The New Blood.",1096761600,4,1563,5.351020408163265

322089,5,6301094352,"Okay, even I had to admit that when I first saw that Friday The 13th Part VII was coming out at my local theatre I was shocked. Not shocked because they had made another, that was almost to be expected (especially with the ending to Part VI), but that I wasn't even sure what else they could do!  Well, needless to say that I was impressed to see an original idea: a young girl with telekinesis to play our young blonde heroine.  This movie ended up being my second favorite in the series and gives me exactly what I expect in a Jason film!

It's probably a few years after Tommy Jarvis drowned Jason in the bottom of Crystal Lake and now a young girl named Tina has just seen her father hit her mother one too many times.  Tina runs out to the dock and begins to flee in a boat.  When her father makes it outside to plead with her to stay, we get to see that Tina is much more than your average child when she uses telekinesis to destroy the dock her father is on and accidentally pin him underwater (next to Jason, of course).  We then fast forward to Tina in her early twenties (if you're timelining the Jason series we're near the 22nd century by now) returning to Crystal Lake to finish her therapy and try to be ""normal"" again.  As always happens in this series, the house next door is being rented by a bunch of teenagers and all sorts of parties, sex, drugs, and other naughty behaviors of youth are guaranteed.  The very night she arrives Tina attempts to bring her father back and accidentally brings Jason back to life instead!  It's only a matter of time before Jason begins to see his woods getting tainted by young kids behaving badly and the killing starts.

This installment had a good dose of everything in my opinion.  It had an interesting storyline (far fetched, maybe, but interesting nonetheless), it had some great gory inventive scenes (weed wacker!), and it had plenty of cheesy lines and pointless nudity.  The hands down best part of this film has to be the final fifteen minutes.  We get a mano-a-mano faceoff between Tina and Jason in plenty of different atmospheres complete with the removal of Jason's mask so we can see just how deformed his hideous mug is at this point!

Terry Kiser (Weekend At Bernie's) makes an appearence as Tina's doctor, Dr. Crews, and although he gives a pretty weak performance, it's still a familiar face.  If you were a fan of 80's and 90's ""B"" films (Vice Academy anyone?) then you should notice Elizabeth Kaitan playing Robin.  Lar Park-Lincoln plays the strong willed Tina and although she seems constantly disturbed, does a pretty decent Carrie impression.  The most noticed addition is Kane Hodder playing Jason (he plays the role in Parts VII-X), he gives the role such a large presence along with a real expressionistic feel to Jason's movements (yes, it's possible to ACT as Jason!).

The DVD is, again, standard, but ultimately a disappointment in my book.  We get the movie in widescreen, we get an upgrade to 5.1 surround sound (yeah!), and we get the trailer.  The reason it's a let down is that it is obvious that many scenes in this movie were cut (half of the really good deaths are cut-aways or we don't even see the wounds) and I feel that this would have made for a great unrated edition!  Paramount, yet again, claims these were lost scenes, but I don't buy it for a second!  This movie was clearly hacked to pieces and if it were completely uncut I'm pretty sure it would be bumped up to number 1 in my book!  This movie still has everything I wanted out of a Jason film and should be purchased along with Part IV and VI before any others are even considered!",1092009600,4,3639,4.472012102874433

Lar Park Lincoln stars as Tina Shepard, a teenager with uncontrolled telekinetic powers. As a girl vacationing at Camp Crystal Lake, Tina killed her abusive father with the use of her mental abilities. Years later, seeking intensive counseling from manipulative, greedy psychologist Dr. Crews (Terry Kiser), Tina agrees to participate in a radical therapy that takes her back to Camp Crystal Lake. Unfortunately, Tina's psychic skills rouse the slumbering Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) from his watery grave and, in typically bloody fashion, the vengeful spook begins dispatching the randy teenagers partying in a house nearby. As Tina attempts to stop Jason's slaughter with the use of her powers, the mass-murdering ghoul encounters his toughest opponent yet. This is probably the most over-rated ""Friday the 13th"" to date, and yet I still watch it...",1077235200,,1069,5.369047619047619

Instead of just stupid teens getting killed, you get stupid teens and a telekinetic girl in the mix.  Jason is the 2nd best killer out there.  Freddy is the man, 'cuz he can make your reality the worst thing you've ever seen.",1077148800,,403,4.194805194805195
322149,4,6301094352,"This was the last great Friday The 13th.  Part 8 and ""Jason Goes To Hell"" were both kind of dumb, in my humble opinion.
This one probably has the best plot of the whole series.  It isn't just your average ""Jason kills a bunch of teenagers"", no siree.  This time, the plot revolves around a girl named Tina, who has strong telekinetic powers (the ability to move things with your mind).  Eventually, she proves to be Jason's toughest rival of all time.
Years ago, Tina accidentally used her powers to kill her father, and this incident would continue to haunt the rest of her life.  Soon, she and her mother visit a place called...yes...Camp Crystal Lake.  As usual, a bunch of rowdy teens have inhabited the place too.  After they all meet their fate, courtesy of Mr. Voorhies, Tina must put a stop to Jason once and for all (assuming that's even possible, of course).  In the end, which might just be the most incredible scene of the whole series, Tina manages to give Jason one hell of a fight, via her telekinesis.  Using nothing but her brain, she electrocutes him, makes a house fall on him and sets him on fire, but even all of THAT isn't enough to stop the masked maniac, and....well, I won't tell you what happens in the end.  Just watch it.",1073779200,,1249,4.462555066079295

In order to articulate and explain inanity especially biblically humongous absurdity such as this, one must comment on it in just kind. So here is my visceral response to John Carl Buechler's cinematic wasteland of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988). Also this parody works better if you approach the farce as the lyrical reworking of one 70's landmark to the embarrassment of the other.
(Cue Wild Cherry's ""Play That Funky Music White Boy"" in the background)
(Beginning Opening Instrumental)
Yeah...... start the killing now.......
(Continued Instrumental)
Oh yey yey!!!
(More Instrumental)
As always, he was a homicidal artist... living near Camp
Crystal Lake.
Hardly having any tussles...ah-uh... except with every couple
on the make.
All the action seemed a coming...yeah... all those teen-aged
campers must have been slow.
Old Jason must have chosen swiftly....yes he did... he had to
go visit the mating below.
(Cue Trumpets)
There was huge grunting, deep kissing, and all bases were
seemingly covered...
Then right then they heard him and the couples turned around
and screamed,
""Impale Us Now With Table Legs Masked One. Butcher Us Until The
Body Count's Right. Slaughter Us In Whatever Way Masked One.
Throttle Us If Necessary, Living Way Past Twenty Is A Crime. Is
A Crime! Oh Yeah!""
(More Instrumental)
Ho! Ho!
(Continued Instrumental)
All Right!
(Additional Instrumental)
Yeah, Jason tried to comprehend this... Just as he was
hollowing their heads.
Were they really quite that stupid....Yes they could...To think
that he could really be that kind.
So he kept on a stalking... Gutting teens every chance he could
take.
He thought that he could reside there...Must return... So he
might live in the forest all alone.
(Cue Trumpets)
Then there came a bustling, a hustling, more outcasts appear in
the wilds there...
First necking, plus groping, and then jarred they turned around
and howled,
""Impale Us Now With Table Legs Masked One. Butcher Us Until The
Body Count's Right. Slaughter Us In Whatever Way Masked One.
Throttle Us If Necessary,
Living Way Past Twenty Is A Crime. Is A Crime! Oh Yeah!""
(Continued Instrumental)
Uh Huh!
(More Instrumental)
Hey! Hey! Is A Crime!
(Additional Instrumental)
Yeah! You Couldn't Have Left Him Buried Now Could You?
(Instrumental Guitar Solo)
Oh, He suddenly became so thirsty... For cannibalizing
teenagers at night.
He noticed he wasn't getting as tipsy... He knew he had to
whittle many more teens quick.
His frustration grew that much faster...Very much faster... For
the hordes no longer seemed rapidly coming.
Jason just wasn't finding that tingling...No he wasn't... Of
harvesting all those teens that he wanted.
(Cue Trumpets)
Yet just then came cheap Pintos, Volkswagens, RV's motoring to the cabins...
Then the smooching, and love-bites just before the couples
turned and whaled,

Until The Body Count's Right. Slaughter Us In Whatever Way
Masked One. Throttle Us If Necessary, Living Way Past Twenty Is

(The End)
As for the DVD edition of John Carl Buechler's Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, this rather excellently translated DVD edition contains a rather conventional 1:85 to 1 wide-screen anamorphic presentation, a slightly above standard Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo audio track, a single theatrical trailer, and virtually nothing else to acknowledge save the massively deficient film itself.
P.S. Not even the streaming whirlwinds of telepathy, psychotherapy, or the mono e mono bruiting madness of asinine melodrama can save this massively asunder cinematic impetuous idiocy for the merciless whims of it's own vividly insipid one-dimensionality. View this imbecilic wreck at your own grave risk of momentary blindness, intellectual scurvy, or possible mental incapacitation. You have been warned. I'd rather watch all the episodes of V the television show than this.",1073088000,,4354,5.2214285714285715

322193,4,6301094352,"I have never really been a fan of the Friday series ( Im much more or a Freddy fan ) but the series has interested me and I have watched a few of the movies in the series ( part 1, 2, Jason X and Freddy Vs Jason and of course this one ) and this has to me one of my favorite out of the bunch I have viewed. It is so clever and interesting that it is a great part of the series ( not to mention one of my favorite movies is Carrie and this features a telekinetic girl ) and I will have to buy it!
Tina killed her father at a young age when he hit her mother. He went right into crystal lake, where Jason is when we last left him in part 6. And we then meet up again with Tina years later and discover she is in counciling for the death of her father. This story is so unlike the rest in the series it could have done well not under the name of FRIDAY THE 13TH. But it is and Tina returns to CL do continue counciling and meets up with a party and joins them just as she awakens Jason and he comes up and does what he does best and swings that machettee for about an hour. Then the two ( tina and jason ) meet face to face and duke it out.
This is a good movie and could have been possibly better if we could have actually SEEN the gore and eaths happen. But while the gore was taken almost completely out it only opened more room for suspense which what makes a horror moive great...and this is close to it. This is a must see if you're a huge fan of the series and even if you're not, it's still a good moive that will interest you and at the same time make you quiver.",1069459200,,1569,3.7720364741641337
322194,3,6301094352,"Make-up & special effects man John Carl Buechler directed this 7th entry to the Friday the 13th series coming right on the heels of that '86 masterpiece, Troll.  This is the one where Jason is still at the bottom of Crystal Lake chained to a big rock until the girl with telekenetic powers revives him by accident.  This is a decent entry as far as they go, but the gore factor is weak for a Jason film.  Maybe its because this is an edited version of the film, but Jason's kills are even less creative.  At one point he throws a girl out a window...thats it!  You get the feeling that money was trying to be saved in this one, which doesn't make sense considering the money this series pulls in.  I've heard there are uncut versions of these films so viewing this film with all gore intact might have great effect.  There are rumors of a box set possibly in 2004 so I'm waiting for that.  Hopefully they will be uncut versions of all the films because thats what the fans want.  As for ""New Blood"" as a film, its still fun, the only thing that makes it different from other entries is the battle between Jason and Tina the girl who can move objects with her mind.  Jason is also unmasked and visible at great lengths in the conclusion which is good and bad.  Kane Hodder does a great job, in this his first of 4 films as Jason.  Still the edits make it kind of lame, reducing gore which is kind of the whole point.",1062979200,3,1415,4.2388059701492535
322195,4,6301094352,"This ""Friday the 13"" movie has a creative story and script behind it, I must admit.  It adds more of a supernatural element to it all (besides the walking corpse who wears a hockey mask and kills people with various sharp instruments).  Definitely one of the better films in the Jason series, ""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood"" is a blood-soaked movie with thrills, excitement and entertainment.
Tina Shepard has the ability to see the future and is able to move things with her mind.  She's been able to do this ever since she was little.  She has been brought back to Crystal Lake to face her past and find out why she can do all of these things (not knowing that the real reason her doctor has brought her there is to exploit her).  Then something unimaginable happens; with her Telekinesis she has unchained Jason from the bottom of the lake, enabling him to start his bloody rampage all over again.  The only thing is that Jason might've found the only person who can take him down once and for all.  Can Tina put the hockey-masked killer to rest for good?  Or will she be another number to add to Jason's body-count?
I thought this one had a really cool idea behind it all.  Again, the makers of this movie are trying to achieve something a little different and have succeeded.  They still don't shy away from the initial purpose of a Jason movie.  There is an extra story to it all, but we still get to see Jason slaughtering people left and right.  That's really the only reason we want to see these movies.  We want to see him in action and we want to see how he is taken out of the picture.  And, Jason looks his best in this one, I must say.  Never have I seen the make-up so up to par.  He looks INCREDIBLE.  I don't think he looks nearly as good in any of the other movies.  One of the big pluses for the movie.
Again, the DVD is very lacking in the special features department.  The movie looks and sounds great.  That part of the DVD was done in an excellent manner.  However, there are NO special features at all.  Not a trailer in sight, nor anything else for that manner.  I wished Paramount would put more effort into these DVDs.  Still, it doesn't take anything away from the movie, at least.  Just would've been nice to have some extras to play around with.
""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood"" is an excellent movie in the Jason series.  It has a great story, great concept, and most of all some really cool death scenes.  This is definitely one of the better ones in the series, without a doubt.",1061683200,,2530,4.327659574468085

You get to see the dead version of Jason without the mask at the end of the movie but it's really no big deal. I tried to like Part 7, I really did, but the movie was just somewhat dull.

The kills are nicely done (despite the toned down gore count, you can just tell that there was many a edit here) as many garden tools are implemented, and the girls are nice looking; both of which are staples of the franchise.

This is the first F13 where Jason has been confronted by someone with powers almost as potent as his - a troubled teenage girl with telekinesis who accidentally killed her father at Crystal Lake years ago.

322237,1,6301094352,"Since most comments of the movie have been made I'll stick to commenting on this DVD. F13 Part VII: The New Blood is my fave Friday the 13th movie thanks to the strong supernatural elements and a jazzed up score from Harry Manfredini and Fred Mollin. I looked forward to this DVD, I was let down tremendously.
Director John Carl Buechler was horrified when the MPAA made him chop his film up worse than Jason ever could and censor almost every spot of blood. This changed the film from a strong and effective horror to a tedious assembly of teens getting killed.
Horror films are supposed to offend and upset. In horror you have the capability to provoke a very wide variety of emotions from your audience. Even if the source material is rather weak, if pulled off correctly you can entertain them in such a way that they'll babble about the movie for weeks and perhaps never forget it.
This is exactly what John Carl Buechler did with this movie. Sadly no audience was to be exposed to his make-up genius or copious gore. The movie was wasted. Or, in his own words, castrated. I couldn't agree more.
Buechler approached Paramount with his own cut of the film, many deleted scenes and a wealth of extra material and proposed a special edition DVD. Paramount flat out said 'NO' even tho Buechler offered to work on the DVD for free. Knowing that there were MANY fans out there who feel the same way about the movie Buechler set up a petition and got thousands of signatures begging Paramount to release Part VII as a Special Edition. Still, there answer was, flat out, 'NO'.
And now that this DVD has been released what extra features does it have? None. Even after all this and all the begging Paramount didn't even give us a trailer. Something they were 'kind' enough to give Parts 1-6. I see no reason to buy this unless you have submitted your VHS copy and need the DVD.
Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood is anamorphically enhanced at 1.78:1 and has a remastered Dolby 5.1 soundtrack made from the original Ultra Stereo recordings. Unfortunately, it's not a good 5.1 track with hardly any .1LFE use or surround use.",1041033600,4,2124,4.56282722513089

322270,4,6301094352,"As a fan of the entire Friday the 13th series, I will say that this one is up there as one of the best. First off, this entry has Kane Hodder's debut as Jason, making him ""unofficially"" known as the ""one true Jason,"" playing him for the rest of the series until Jason X. He has great body language, even with the little touches, like raising and lowering his shoulders when Jason is angry. This one also has, in my opinion, one of the best kills, before Jason X, in the cult-loving sleeping bag kill. The make-up effects are great, as Jason looks like he belongs in the pages of an EC Comics ""Tales From the Crypt"" comic,with his spine and knee caps exposed. There is a couple downsides to this film, one being the plot. Yes, it is kind of cheesy that the heroine has telekenesis to help her against Jason. The second downside isn't at the fault of the movie. It is due to the MPAA editing the gore out of this movie severly. But aside from that, one can enjoy this movie as Kane hodder's debut as the undying Mass murderer we all know. So sit back and enjoy this one. Good kills, good make up effects, and Kane Hodder. How can we go wrong?",1036540800,,1140,4.23394495412844
322271,3,6301094352,"I don't have much more to say about this one that other reviewers haven't already said. It's the typical Jason deal with the ""twist"" we all know about. That's a hoot though because she uses her powers for the most moronic things. Like what? Like making tree branches attack Jason! If she's that creative, then you'd think she could be a bit logical. Oh, no; The movie would be over too soon if she did that. This isn't one of the best, but this one has the best looking Jason though. He looks great in this one, quite frightening(then he'd go on to grow skin and look like Sloth from The Goonies in part 8, and almost totally regenerate in Jason X). Another gem is to see Bernie from Weekend At Bernie's as the schmuck doctor. This one also has(coming in a close second to part 8) the stupidest ""death"" of Jason. Who thought that was a good idea? Who thought the audience would buy that? You can also tell by this point the MPAA started to get more involved in the series because the violence looks trimmed pretty heavily. It's not nearly as graphic as earlier films in the series. It's an enjoyable installment though, no sillier than the rest(with the exception of the ending, but that's all part of it's MST3K appeal).",1035417600,,1221,4.455357142857143
322272,4,6301094352,"This is my favorite out of the sequels, it has the best Jason make up ever. Jason looks better in this movie than he ever has in any of the other movies. I agree that when i watch this movie it feels like i'm watching the edited tv version. Matter of fac the only problem i can find with this sequel is the ending, which i haven't seen a single reviewer mention. Her father coming up at the end and grabbing jason after all those years. They would have pulledhis body out of the lake when it happened.
I know it's a ""movie"" but the ending still bugs a little. Kane Hodder is the best Jason hands down, and no one has ever played Jason better. This is my personal favorite of all the friday films. One of the things i like about Kane Hodder and this movie is that Jason kills with a sense of humor and respect, he respects Tina fighting back, so it seems, like if she's a real challenge for him. There's a great scene in the end of Jason goes to Hell that shows what i mean when Jaon doesn't kill the guy right away, but the guy tries to hit him with a shovel and he grabs it from him and just ""taps him with it, it's too funny and only Kane Hodder would do something like that. Great movie, i'll be waiting for ""uncut"" edition",1034985600,2,1226,4.070247933884297
322273,2,6301094352,"There are many problems with this movie.  Jason, despite being the most famouse slasher out there, had some seriouse weak films in his resume.  This is one of those films.
This movie is about a Girl named Tina (Hmm, I wonder what movie she came from) who has telekenetic powers (I wonder where she got those from) that she inadvertedly used to kill her father in the begining of the film.  She returns ten years later to complete her therepy at the scene of the accident.  The doctor is a [jerk]and basically wants to exploit her powers.  Meanwhile next door a set of teens (about ten of them) are getting ready to throw a surprise party for a friend (who never shows up, hmmm I wonder why).She gets pissy one night and accidenaly resurects Jason (after Tommy went through all the trouble to bury him at the bottom of the lake).  Within a matter of minutes he systematically slaughters a few kids on the side of the road and two more ""getting it on""  in a tent.  This moment provids a fan favorite, the sleeping bag into the tree bit (whoopdy doo).  This movie continues the same procedure, most teens ""Getting it on"" and the typical skinny dipping death.  What seperates this one from the others (beside Kane Hodder making his Jason debute) is the fact that in the last ten to fifteen minute face off Jason is not wearing his mask.  Despite that this movie just goes to show how little Paramount actually cared about the series.  It was a good thing that New line purchased the series because the later result was Jason X.",1034467200,,1523,4.478260869565218
322274,5,6301094352,But the kills were cut and it feels like your watching a tv edited version when it is the theatrical version. Jason's face is killer in this one. This is the last good sequel until Jason X. Part 8 and 9 the Final Friday were complete junk!!!,1033948800,,241,4.148936170212766
322275,5,6301094352,"With horror movies, the filmmakers have to be really careful with sequels, keeping them fresh, new, and full of surprises. This time around, they accomplished that very goal pretty well.
Jason finally meets his match in this outstanding, extremely popular sequel; Tina, a girl with the ability to move objects with her emotions, uses this power to keep Jason at bay.
When Tina was a child, she killed her father at Crystal Lake with these very powers, accidently.
Many years later, Tina returns to Crytal Lake for treatment of this trauma with her Doctor, Dr. Cruise... but he's only out to exploit her gift.
Mourning the loss of her father even more now, at the sight of the lake, she attempts to revive him with her abilities, but she has no idea that Jason Vorhees too, is at the bottom of the lake, drowned by Tommy Jarvis in the 6th sequel. Accidently, she revives Jason, and once again, continues his murderous rage at Camp Crystal Lake.
Replacing the previous Jason actor, the legendary Kane Hodder makes his first appearence in a Friday The 13th film, and blows all other competition away. He's bigger, badder, and more brutal than any of the others and has become an icon for Jason fans. The makeup effects in this film are some of the best you'll EVER see in a Jason film. Incredible. Jason looks cooler than he has ever before.
One gripe about this film is the lack of gore. This entry into the series went through the most cutting and editing than any of the other sequels. However the death scenes still manage to be clever (wait until you see the infamous vicim-in-sleeping bag scene)!
Another whine would be the DVD. While the video and audio are good, you'll be again, disapointed with no special features.
I would definetely recommend this movie to horror fans. Especially Jason fans, and newcomers to the series.

322276,3,6301094352,"Today, I got up early in the morning to have my breakfast and then head over to the DVD store to get FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 7 - THE NEW BLOOD on DVD.
This film is ONLY satisfactory but this is still a watchable film. First off, when released theatrically on Friday May 13, 1988, the director (John Carl Beuchler) fought with the MPAA as the film had to be cut to get an R rating. Despite that, this film did well at the boxoffice and packed in moviehouses because of the reputation and the ending of JASON LIVES.
This film, though not an original concept deals with Tina Shepherd, a young girl with telekenetic powers accidently wakes up Jason from the waters of Crystal Lake. An accident the girls' therapist wanted to have happen. This is a so-so sequel with above average special effects with a little less gore than usual. The ""gore"" ended up on the cutting room due to fights the director had with the MPAA.
This film also meets a littel controversy. With the cuts that had to made to the film when theatrically released, people and fans of the series were hoping to have the film released ""uncut"" on DVD. People on the fridaythe13thfilms.com website created a petition a few months back with the support and help of the films' director to release the film ""ucut"" on DVD. With the release of this DVD today, everything has fallen on deaf ears as Paramount Pictures don't consider these films as ""important"" films. Every murder (15 in all) were all cut, there were a bit more dialogue pieces (as if anyone would care about that) and a teaser ending whenre Jason jumps out of the water and grabs a fisherman who is on the dock fishing for fish. Maybe one day, an ""uncut"" version will be released but I don't think that would happen until all eight films are fully turned over to New Line Cinema, the owner of the films and its' franchise.
The DVD cover is certainly better looking than Parts 5 & 6 but it still looks terrible. The menu board and disc design looked pretty good. The back cover is even more hideous. I was happy with the widescreen transfer. There were some shots that appeared more dark then others and some areas, I was able to see some red, around the scene where Tina's mom and Dr. Crews are running from Jason. Other than that, there are not too many blemishes on this DVD transfer. I was disappointed with the 5.1 Digital Mix as the dialogue couldn't be heard that greatly and there were some nice sound effects but the films intro credits music score was neuseating. It felt like being ""gonged"" too many times on the Gong Show. Headache. The ""crunches"" were nice but sounded like someone was taking bites off a Crunchie bar.
As for extras, my gosh, there is absolutely nothing ""extra"" on this DVD. Like ""extras"" are just another one of those four letter words to Paramount. That is such a shame. Paramount is the worst when it comes to extras as there are usually ""none"" provided in most of the films it has released. So much for a 90th Anniversary.
This film is worthy to have for hard core Friday / Jason fans. The release of this DVD is better than nothing and maybe, an ""uncut"" version of this film will one day be made available.",1031011200,2,3157,4.454231433506045
322298,5,6301094352,"This is the best of the series. Jason looks his scarist with part of his mask being cut off by the boat propeller in part 6. His clothes looks ragidy and jason kills like a sereis maniac in this one. The women who play ""Tina"" and ""robyn"" are pretty",1030838400,,248,4.081632653061225
322299,3,6301094352,"This is easily one of the better efforts in the Friday series but it suffers just like the rest of them from cuts, cuts, cuts.  This is, apparently, one of the most cut entries by far as the MPAA rejected many of the more elaborate gore effects.  Director John Carl Buechler is a respected makeup effects man and was a good choice to helm a Friday flick.  A lot was put into the effects, especially for Jason.  This marks Kane Hodder's first turn as the hockey-masked killer, and he gets the best makeup effects for the role.
The New Blood's Jason is a full-blown, rotting, hulking zombie.  Check out the exposed ribs and spinal column under the shredded clothes.  We also get a look at Jason's face, or what's left of it (including a big hole in the cheek, exposed teeth, rotting flesh, etc).  That alone is enough for fans to check out the film, even if you're just a casual horror fan.
The ::ahem:: story involves Tina (Lar Park Lincoln), a Carrie-like teen girl who travels back to Crystal Lake years after an unfortunate and uncontrolled episode with her telekinetic powers led to her father's death.  Accompanying her are her mother and her psychiatrist.  The latter is played by none other than Terry Kiser, aka Bernie Lomax from Weekend at Bernie's(!)  Being a psychiatrist in a horror film, he's naturally evil, trying to exploit the girl's powers for his own gains.  (At one point Tina finds newspaper clippings about Jason and the murders in the doctor's desk along with a gun. It's never made entirely clear whether he was concerned and afraid of their surroundings or if he wanted to use Tina to raise Jason from the dead).
Next door to the not-so-happy family, of course, a house full of young, stupid, would-be victims.  (Apparently the brutal murders occuring regularly around the lake still don't detract vacationers!)
Well, once Tina raises Jason from the dead (involuntarily) the action gets under way.  And he's quite busy, as this has easily one of the highest Friday body counts.  Ch-ch-ch-ah-ah-ah...  Our young vacationers are dispatched with a lovely array of sharp objects, gardening tools, and even a plastic party horn(!)  Jason also repeats himself a bit by simply throwing one girl out the window, and crushing some poor sap's head.  All of the murders are edited down until there's little blood and gore.  What sets this Friday apart from the others in terms of cutting is the fact that Buechler himself has tried hard to petition Paramount to release a proper DVD version of the film with all of the material he had to cut for an R rating restored.
This, of course, is NOT that DVD.
Among the blood and guts left on the cutting room floor (ha!) is the death of good 'ol Bernie Lomax.  Jason gets all handyman on us when he employs some kind of weed-wacker with a big circular saw blade on the doctor.  You see almost nothing on this DVD, but apparently this was all quite grisly with innards flying everywhere.  Supposedly one of--if not the--best effects in the film was trimmed as well.  That would be the axe-in-the-face effect on that cheesy preppy guy by the lake.  Melissa's death (by axe to head) was also quite special, according to Buechler.
Sure, it's sick.  But isn't that why we watch these films?  Why won't Paramount give us all a fair shake?  And for a director of one of these classics to come out and lobby hard for a restored release--how great is that?
This is definitely one of my favorite Friday flicks.  I would just love to see the rest of it.  The tone of these films is dampened by all of the cuts and choppy edits in the murder portions.
This DVD is not recommended unless you reeeally want it or if you've worn out your VHS copy.  Also, what the heck is going on with the artwork on these DVDs?!  Check out the cover of this, or of Part VI.  What's up?  They can't get the original artwork?  Completely, utterly lame.",1030665600,36,3876,4.595342066957787

This film has a stunning opening sequence, a great climaxing battle, Jason at his most horrific, and an interesting plot involving psychokinesis, but said storyline is constantly playing second fiddle to the usual load of gormless, sex-mad teenagers who turn up at the lake and are killed off one by one.  To make matters worse, the death scenes are very bog-standard and uninteresting compared to those in previous films.  The title music is great, very sinister, but most of the incidental music throughout the film is just recycled from previous Friday 13th movies.

Nevertheless, despite its synopsis being so silly that the film might as well be entitled ""Carrie Vs. Jason"", it really was the scariest, most stylish and atmospheric entry of all. ""Originally this movie was going to unite Freddy and Jason for the first time,"" explains director/special effects expert John Carl Buechler. ""Obviously it didn't happen, as neither New Line Cinema, nor Paramount Pictures could figure out how to go to bed together. From what I've been told, they both wanted to distribute. Anyway, a lot of work had been done on the script prior to my arrival, and it seemed they wanted a guy who was a good director, and could handle special effects. I guess that's why they interviewed me for the job. I figured that I was a long shot, though Frank Mancuso Jr. had said that he'd liked my movie Troll. I thought that I really put my foot in it when I spoke my mind about the Friday the 13th Movies. I didn't like them. I thought that they were dull and needed to go in a fresh direction. Apparently Frank and Barbara Sacks, his associate producer, liked what I had to say and I got the job. So when Freddy fell out of the picture it was decided not to scrap all the development work that had been done. They still wanted to make a big effects film. Launching into Daryl Haney's concept of a supernatural nemesis for Jason would be essentially to replace Freddy with a `Carrie' clone. Thus `Tina' was born and Daryl wrote an interesting screenplay; Friday the 13th, Part 7: The New Blood was green-lighted! I've always respected the mythos of movies in a series and considered it important to continue that which had been established; after all, tons of fans take these movies as gospel. As I wanted to build on the strong foundation of what had gone before, then move ahead in a new way; we did! It was clear to me that the ratings board would no longer allow graphic make-up effects as they had previously been used in this series. Nonetheless, we created our share of gore knowing that it would be censored out. I decided to use make-up and special effects in such a way as to still create impact. So I devised a new and improved Jason!""

Kane Hodder plays Jason as he stalks this girl staying at Crystal Lake to be watched and documented by her mother, and her shrink. While trying to resurrect her dead father with her powers, she resurrects Jason instead. Uh-oh. And, of course, there is a house filled with partying teens next door. Can you say knife fodder?.

322426,4,6301094352,"Spoilers ahead. Read with caution.
Despite the relatively poor reviews it's received and the heavy lack of gore,Friday 7 is actually pretty cool and in my opinion is the fourth best of the F13th series (6,4 and 2 being  the others). The script is a bit laughable. A girl with psychic powers that  has the ability to lift objects and use them as weapons. It is a bit  dumb,but all in all works out well. Jason looks REAL ugly and scary in this  one (wait until he's unmasked. You'll probably faint because he looks so  gruesome and disgusting).The acting isn't too bad,but is a bit laughable in  parts (example,at one point Nick finds his brother Michael impaled on a  tree branch. He just stands there. Would've you screamed  in terror or had a  heart attack if you found a friend or family member like that?) The best  actor of the whole film overall is undoubtably Kane Hodder. His performance  as Jason is very menacing and devilish and breathes countless amounts of  life into the character. You've never seen an actor quite like him. The  special F/X are Ok,but the film really shines in the make-up department. As  I said earlier,Jason looks very gross when he's unmasked. It's truly the  definitive Jason. You can see his spine,rib-cage and various other bones  exposed. He looks fantastic. The scares are terrific. Creepy music and a very  dark atmosphere make this a  horribly scary movie. My only gripe is the  severe lack of gore. There's hardly any. Hopefully,as  Squall suggests,a  remastered VHS and the DVD will contain cut footage,deleted scenes and  loads of  extras. At least the film's bloodier than Part 8. Overall,Friday 7  is a very enjoyable and scary chapter of the series. It's a lot better than  Parts 8 and 9 (as well as Parts 1,3 and 5),but it's not quite as good as  Parts 2,4 and 6. It's still excellent though. Rated R for mild slasher  violence,mild profanity,brief drug use and some nudity.",959299200,13,1923,4.713855421686747

My favorite lines from  this move would have to be when Melissa says ""Hey Tina, is this the  way they wear their jackets back at the mental hospital?"" or when  Robin says ""Get real, Maddy.

The characters were kinda believeable,but Jason was truly the most believeable,because of Kane  Hodder's performance. He is so wonderful at the part and blows all the  other Jason actors away. He makes 'em look like cardboard cutouts. Another  great feature were the brilliant make-up FX.Jason's face make-up is so  disgusting and gross and is truly the definitive Jason. His exposed spine  and rib-cage looked great and fit in perfectly. The make-up FX here is  undoubtably the best the series has to offer. The film is also pretty scary  and the atmosphere is somewhat disturbing. Director Buechler does a  fantastic job indeed. You're probably wondering why I didn't give it a  five-star rating. This is  because of the heavy lack of gore. It came close  to being as gore-lacking as part 8. Practically all of the make-up FX were  removed. This is a severe problem indeed. Hopefully,a remastered VHS and the  DVD will have the cut footage. We can only hope. Still,I do recommend it and  the film was a very enjoyable surprise indeed.

I remember watching a few scenes from this movie when I was little. Then I started watching them when I was 13. I'm a huge Jason fan, and this sequel, along with part 8, was the hardest to find. They didn't have it in any of my local video stores. In 2011, I finally found it online. Friday the 13th, The Ultimate Collection, includes 8 films with tons of features.

7810409,4,6301094352,"Not classically campy, per se, but this was one of the conceptually zanier installments of the franchise.  Still buckets of fun and great effects, and still recommended.

Part 6 SIDEBAR:  Yup, Jason keeps getting almost, sort of, nearly killed and then keeps coming back alive and well like Wolverine.  Part IV ended after 12-year old Tommy (Corey Feldman; Friday the 13th Parts IV-V, The Lost Boys, Gremlins) killing Jason and, likewise, part V ended with Tommy (now 17 or 18) (John Shepherd; Bless the Child) killing the Jason Voorhees copycat. And then, in part V (and since the end of part IV), Jason Voorhees was, in fact, actually dead only to be resurrected by a lightning strike in part VI, which ended with a yet older Tommy leaving Jason drowned (yet again) and chained at the bottom of Crystal Lake.

Franchise Timeline SIDEBAR:  Part 1 took place in present day (1980), part 2 was 5 years later (so 1985), part III continued the next day (also 1985), and part IV took place in 1985 immediately after the events of part III starting with Jason in the hospital morgue (a la Halloween II).  Bucking the trend, part V jumped forward 5-6 years (so 1990-1991-ish) and then (probably more of a writing flaw than anything) part VI takes us questionably another 10-ish years yet further into the future (soooo, 2001?).  Part VII provides no time statement, but could just as well occur in the same year as part VI.

Following the Tommy Jarvis story arc (parts IV-VI), director John Carl Buechler (Troll, Cellar Dweller, Ghoulies go to College) provides a recap of past franchise installments and introduces us to a young girl with psychic powers.  In a flashback, young Tina (Jennifer Banko; Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Barb Wire) unintentionally kills her father in a telekinetic fit of anger.  After years of hospitalized therapy, Tina (Lar Park-Lincoln; House II) and her psychotherapist Doctor Crews (Terry Kiser; Weekend at Bernies I-II) return to the scene of her trauma (their house on Crystal Lake) in hopes of concluding her treatment; it seems that her psychokinetic abilities resulted from her suppressed guilta movie psychology claim about as out there as the psychoplasmics notion in The Brood (1979)!

Not a day by the lake and Tinas emotions get the better of her, and she inadvertently resurrects Jason (Kane Hodder; Hatchet, Smothered, Chillerama) with a telekinetic outburst.  With his return considered a mentally ill girls fever dream, our water-logged zombie Jason looks cooler than ever with his spine and ribs exposed and a chain necktie.  They did a great job with the effects of his decaying body, the reveal of what his undead face now looks like under the mask, and Kane Hodder added flavorful posture to our killer.

Incontinuity SIDEBAR: So, in part VI we learned that the locals of Crystal Lake changed its name to Forest Green to help forget the horrors of Crystal Lakes past.  But that is not acknowledged and the signs all say Crystal Lake.

Jason may be up to his typical shenanigans, but (like part VI) this sequel isn't terribly campy.  He crushes heads, punches through torsos, bursts through windows and walls, and leaps out of water like the good old days while his female victims continue to take every opportunity to take off their tops (including a rather raunchy skinny-dipping scene).  But despite all the boobage, the kills maintain a more semi-serious approach (lacking the sillier eyeball-popping antics of part III).  A favorite death scene of mine, this is the first time Jason employs the sleeping bag slam kill.

Well, hold on. Remember when I said this wasn't terribly campy? I should have said not intentionally campy.  As if no one saw it coming, the movie ends with a long and rather action-packed finale pitting Tinas psychic powers against our unstoppable Crystal Lake revenant.  The effects don't hold up so well as she pummels Jason with couches, light fixtures, the porch roof and flower pots but its still pretty fun to watch! LOL. Its especially pleasing seeing Jasons face!

Tina finds victory in the strangest of possible ways, returning Jason to his watery tomb and being hauled away in an ambulance with no recovery of Jasons body.  Typical, I suppose, in preserving the ease of the next sequel.  Im not complaining. With a bonkers ending like this, I found it hard to take this sequel seriously.  However, it was a really fun ride!",1511481600,,4415,4.9071332436069985
