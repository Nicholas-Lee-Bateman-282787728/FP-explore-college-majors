8313085,4,B001JL96OU,"Moderate workout focused on the abs - but made more fun because it incorporates elements of bellydance!  I enjoyed it.  I took off one star because it isn't too challenging, imho.  My abs worked most during the sit ups rather than the bellydancing.  This is a great video to do on the days that I don't feel like doing an intense workout, but still need to coax myself into doing some type of workout.",1440201600,,401,4.378378378378378

8313087,2,B001JL96OU,"I wanted to try this dvd cause I thought it would be a good DVD.  But, to tell the truth I was really disappointed and I love Rania's dvd's.  I figured it would be better.  I didn't get much out of it at all.",1336867200,,208,3.6818181818181817
8313088,4,B001JL96OU,"This DVD has a nice workout that's fairly easy to follow. I did miss the routine at the end, in which Rania puts together the combinations you learn. I'm not sure why that wasn't on here. But the combinations were nice because you could do them individually without having to do the others. The warm-up, for me, seemed more aptly called a workout. There really wasn't any warming up. Rania just has you jump right in. I think a slower paced warm-up would help get people prepared for the workout. You really have to pay attention to that as an instructor because beginners especially may not know what constitutes a proper and safe warm-up.",1329782400,,640,4.62280701754386
8313089,5,B001JL96OU,"Rania delivers a very nice and effective abs workout that you can really feel.  You don't have to ruin the disks in your back with bunches of crunches.  Try this instead, it works, it feels good, and it's much more enjoyable.  Also, since it's done standing and in rhythm to the music, if you don't have a really good mat to get down on the floor, you don't have to worry about that.  Lovely, short video and it's chaptered, take your pick.  Love it, hope you do too.",1308355200,,467,4.261363636363637
8313090,4,B001JL96OU,"This is a routine that is easy to follow, with pure dance movements. I thought the exercis portion was a little weak, but simple enough for the average gal.",1284854400,3,156,4.413793103448276
8313091,4,B001JL96OU,"This is a fun way towards a good ab workout.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with a previous review that said the workout combinations don't flow.  That's true, and it's odd.  But I have very much enjoyed Belly Abs and became much stronger after only a few weeks.  There isn't much explanation of the movements which I find good because the workout pace doesn't slow down as she moves from one segment to the next.  Rania seems much more relaxed in this video than in others too!  A minor note, which was a big plus for me, is that this workout doesn't require a large floorspace.",1267574400,7,600,4.3125
8313092,4,B001JL96OU,"This is a great little video if you know what you're getting. If you have some bellydance experience (from class or videos), if you already know proper dance posture and how to protect your back and knees when exercising, and want a quick dance-based workout that will drill combinations and target your abs, then this video will be perfect for you. The moves really do work the abdominals -- you will feel it! -- and a few sets of crunches add a little more exertion. The combinations are fun, fast, reasonably complex, and quite ""dancey."" I could imagine using any of them, as is, while dancing to music. That said, they become increasingly difficult as the video progresses, so there's some room to grow into the program. And the entire workout clocks in at 33 minutes, which is great if you want a quick burn and sweat.

If you have no bellydance experience, this is not the video for you unless you are gifted at picking up dance moves. Rania does break things down quickly during the video, but it's really more as a reminder. Although she provides a small bonus segment called ""ABCs of Bellydance,"" this is really just an overview of the dance in general. There is no posture instruction. During the actual workout, she assumes you know how to tuck your abs, do mayas and camels, shimmy, and even suggests optional layering of shimmies.

The set is pretty but not distracting, the production values are professional, and the music is a steady but unobtrusive Middle Eastern beat. Rania herself is not the perky cheerleader type of instructor. She's calm, funny, and seems relaxed and natural in this video (much more so than in her Natural Journeys videos). One small fault is that she uses the words ""left"" and ""right"" to refer to her left and right, so you have to adjust if you like to mirror the instructor. I gave the video four stars because of this, and because it's not clear from the DVD copy that it's not at all for beginners. However, the program is good value for the money, and really is intensely targeted on the abdominals.",1245369600,9,2046,4.633608815426998
8313093,5,B001JL96OU,Another great video from Rania! The combinations in this video were fun and effective for toning the abs area.,1229817600,2,110,4.842105263157895
