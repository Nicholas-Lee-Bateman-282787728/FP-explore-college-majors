8763918,4,B01GWC42SK,"This 1981-82 Season is when this show hit its stride and takes me back to memory lane to when I watched GREATEST AMERICAN HERO every Wednesday night at 8PM, right before FALL GUY at 9PM, and then topped off by DYNASTY at 10PM on ABC.

This 1981-1982 Season also takes me back to when ABC's motto was ""ABC Is The Place"" and when Ronald Reagan was president and when we had all those budget cuts, due to the recession we had from 1981-82.",1502668800,,436,4.253012048192771
8763919,5,B01GWC42SK,"Season 2 is even better than Season 1, however the shift from ""Everyday Joe with a magic suit"" to ""Super Hero saves the world"" is becoming more evident.

Still a great way to relax in the evening.",1490572800,,196,4.297297297297297
