3645080,3,B001HVZO7K,"Who's prettier? The female pilots led by character Maxine West (actress Jamie  Mann) or the CGI prehistoric birds in this B-grade movie?

I'm giving this movie a 3-star passing grade only because of the (quite) good-looking actresses. I wouldn't have sat through the end if not for them, especially Maxine (actress Jamie  Mann)! Ha!

Almost everything looks out of place in this low-budget sci-fi movie. With the exception of the flying birds, the computer graphics looks too glaringly obvious.
Jap caps (ear flaps are too long), uniforms are not in order. Makeup on the actresss is too obvious and a little overdone! Looks like the girls are all prepared for a prom night than for war! Rosy red lipstick, waxed eyebrows, eye shadow. Foundation's a little too thick on the youngest pilot. Maxine's perfectly white teeth shone brighter than her eyes and red lipstick. I'm not complaining on this one!... :-P

Here's a spoiler: the island and flying predators were nuked, all males end up dead in the movie. One female copilot and sexy Maxine survive in the end by flying away to freedom and safety.",1260316800,,1097,4.876344086021505
3645081,1,B001HVZO7K,"The user reviews on this were mixed, but since it's the type of movie I'm predisposed to watch I thought I'd give it a try. I figure there might be the few faults that are worth overlooking to enjoy the good stuff. Boy was I wrong. If you overlook the faults there is little left TO enjoy.

The story revolves around a group of female WWII test pilots who are handed a mission to deliver a few military types escorting some top secret cargo to some base in the Pacific. A storm wipes out a couple of their engines and brings them down on an Island inhabited by Japanese soldiers and killer flying dinosaurs.

This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The credits list 4 names with the story and the the director as having written the final script. They still managed to screw things up almost entirely. The acting is awful. The directing and camerawork are equally so. Even the costumes and makeup are terrible. The few Japanese soldiers on the Island that haven't been killed by the monsters are wearing uniforms that are way to clean and nice. The women, even after some number of days working on the planes and fighting these creatures, still sport rosy red lipstick. This is all really basic stuff. How did it get past everyone? The special effects are one of the better things going here but it's a small payoff given what the viewer is made to put up with.

This is not at all a bad idea for a movie but all involved managed to scuttle this project at every turn. Stay away.",1255996800,,1486,4.3768115942028984

This is really a bad movie.  An all-chick team of fighter pilots?  What planet did that happen on?  Not earth, not from 1941 to 1945.  The special effects are just the same generic CGI stuff we've come to expect from a ""Sci Fi Original.""  The script is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.  The acting, worse.  Looks cheap, acts cheap.

3645084,5,B001HVZO7K,"I avoid ""made for sci-fi"" films like the plague, but because I've always been a dinosaur and WW2 buff, I watched it out of curiosity.  I was pleasantly surprised.  No, it isn't a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it IS the best movie by the sci-fi network I've ever seen.  It is well-cast, well-paced and, considering the (low) budget, well-filmed.  All too often, ""B"" movies set in the '30s see an opportunity for everyone to have tongue-in-cheek fun with the costumes, hair styles  and sets, with big-band swing music accompanying the proceedings.  This one, on the other hand, remembers that its setting is a grim one and never tries to be ""cute"".  Another point in its favor is its use of the japanese soldiers:  though depicted as human beings, the film never tries to create a ""kumbayah/We Are the World"" atmosphere.  The 2 factions remain enemies to the bitter end.  I'm not a big fan of CGI as it always gives me the feeling I'm watching animated concept art instead of the real thing, but the way it was handled here was almost acceptable.  Also, the women are handled with unusual maturity.  Depicted as competent soldiers without the shrill screeching of a politically correct agenda, the female characters are not spared the horrors of the island any more than their male counterparts.  No pornographic, slasher-flick mentality here, their untimely ends are shown as tragic and/or heroic. Though the plot is by the numbers, the cast was well chosen and the life they bring to their characters makes this a rather engaging affair.  All in all, one could do a lot worse than this half-way decent little flick. I give it 2 beers up and a bowl of chips.",1245628800,3,1674,4.707903780068729

I liked the tall woman whose plane crashed when the Pteranodon landed on it. Wish she lived. I realize this is a low budget affair and special effects were very good even so.

3645086,4,B001HVZO7K,"Warbirds: DVD review
Grade: B
 The Sci-Fi channels movies are usual good, but I must start out this review by saying that this is probably the best movie it has made. Yes, I did give it a grade B, but I did that for a reason about the DVD, not the movie itself. (More on that later in the review.) People usually judge Sci-Fi movies, almost stereotyping them, and it just makes me mad, furious, because if you're going to take the time to watch a Sci-Fi movie in the first place, you can't really expect to find the next Oscar nominee for best picture. You're crazy if you do.
 Yes, their movies are usual laughingly low-budgeted (they almost seem to take pride in the fact), but the simple truth is this: their movies are fun to watch; they're simple entertainment, in this case, Pterodons assaulting a group of Woman's Airforce Service Pilots.
 The movie starts off with a group of Japanese soldiers mining for oil on an island somewhere in the middle of the Pacific, and the time is in the final days of World War 2. The Japanese unearth some preserved Pteranodon eggs, and they hatch and run amok from there. Simple, yet highly entertaining plot, and no, the plot is not only for the weak-minded; the Pteranodons don't even have much screen-time, which is my only complaint about the movie. (More dinosaurs!! Needs more dinosaurs!!!)

 The acting is also surprisingly good for a Sci-Fi movie, and the characters don't always act suicidal, like in other recent Sci-Fi movies, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yeti/dp/B001H5X6S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yeti</a>. Yes, you do feel for the characters, and you do want them to get out of their situation alive.
 The other problem with the movie though is the special effects. The Pteranodons look great (their made using CGI effects), but did they really have to make almost everything else CGI? I mean, even the ocean is CGI in some parts. Once again, kind of cheap guys.
 As for the DVD itself, the cover is sort of misleading. At first glance, it appears as if there is a Tyrannosaurus Rex attacking the planes. There is no Tyrannosaurus Rex in the movie. If you want to see Pteranodons and T. Rex's in one movie, go watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pterodactyl/dp/B000BNX3BE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pterodactyl</a>. (Which is not as great as this movie.)
 Another problem with the DVD is the special features. I wasn't exactly expecting a whole ""making of"" documentary, but I wanted at least something else! All there is to the special features is the trailer for the movie, and a trailer for some other movie. That's it. Whoop-dee-doo.
 Overall, if you love dinosaurs and the Sci-Fi channel, this is a must-see. They really hit gold with this one, I just wish they would keep making gold like this all the time...But it never hurts to dream, does it?",1236902400,18,2908,5.054279749478079

the cgi, Tohoru Masamune's acting and the scenery.

never evidence of dirt on them ..even after rebuilding planes...

3645088,5,B001HVZO7K,"This Sci Fi Channel production was sort of a dream come true. For those Boomer Dinosaur fans there was a run of comic books in the 60s pitting the WW2 military men against dinosaurs and other prehistoric monsters. In the back of this kids mind was always the question""Wouldn't this make a great movie?"" The battles of blazing machine guns against the roaring monsters begged to be put on the screen. It looked like a great movie for Ray Harryhausen to gift us all with. Alas,it was not to be.....Untill now! CGI replaces the stop motion animation and delivers the most vicious looking Pterasaurs ever seen. Delightfully,this flock of creatures does not look like anything seen on the Discovery Channel. The monsters look much more like the paintings of flying horrors painted by J.Alen St. John for The Land That Time Forgot,or other pulp magazine covers from the 40s. In some aspects this movie looks hauntingly like Harryhausen's unmade movie concept about flying monsters invading 1950s modern times titled ""The Elemenatals"".But who is to say? The look of the props,and the womens make up all hold true to the retro feel of the film. How much more retro can you get than dinosaurs,anyway? There is even a King Kong refurance. No acting awards will be given for this film. But the visions of pilots dogfighting with leathery winged monsters are all that one could ask for and then some on such a meager budget. If you are too grown up,this might be a one timer. For me,it's a keeper for sure!

Fans of the science fiction channel should recognize Brian Krause as the supercool, scarfaced dinosaur hunter from ""Beyond Loch Ness"" (also released as ""Loch Ness Terror""). Actually if you remember this factoid without me reminding you, then you have no life and horrible taste in movies much like myself. But he's nowhere near as good starring in Warbirds, and neither are the other actors, really.

In part, that's representative of the whole movie. An overambitious project that tries too hard for the budget it obviously lacks. The air combat footage is all CGI, naturally, and not good CGI. The actors don't have the skills to carry the depth and message the script is trying to convey, and the script isn't good either. Technical inaccuracies abound to the point of distraction.

FIVE (*****) five-star reviews
THREE (****) four-star reviews
THREE (***) three-star reviews
THREE ( ** ) two - star reviews
THREE ( * ) o-n-e -star reviews

All you can ASSUME from reading those reviews is that they all SAW the same movie, er,
uh, differently. Yeah! THAT's it.

Full disclaimer... I am a former military member; retired.
I saw this on a 55"" Sony via a Panasonic Blu-Ray player.

Now, it's MY turn.

I enjoyed the hell out of the movie, it was GREAT! The price was fantastic!

Briefly:
Some WASPs (not to be confused with White Anglo-Saxon Protestants)[Womens Airforce
Service Pilots] ferried a B29[bomber] to Hawaii. They are ordered on a ""TOP SECRET""
mission led by a Army Artillery Colonel and his small detachment of men.
Enroute, they are attacked by flying dinosaurs. They land on a Japanese occupied island
[in The South Pacific] to repair the bomber. As seen on my monitor, and heard, on a Bose
5.1 Channel Surround system; the Video and Audio was e-x-c-e-l-l-e-n-t.
The video was SO good, I noticed the lead actress had a mosquito bite on her chin for
much of the movie after landing on the island. In one scene, Jason London (the Colonel)
has two very small mosquitoes land on HIS face, and he ignores them for film-posterity.
The ""Colonels' over-acting"" (a reviewer stated) reminded ME of more than a FEW former
commanders I have had; especilly during my time in Vietnam.

PROs:
I t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h-l-y enjoyed the movie; the actors; the CGI-SFX; editing; musical score; and set decoration --
with the exception of that mentioned in the following paragraph.

CONs:
Not explained is HOW an American Army ""Two-and-a-half-ton [capacity] cargo truck"" ended up on the island
-- never mind it is a vintage 1970's model Deuce-an'-a-half. But, no one would notice the difference anymore
than I could tell the difference between a 1938 VW[Porche]Beetle, promoted by Hitler himself in the 1945-1976
Volks' Wagon (""Folks' Car"").

The CGI-- there's NOT a lot of real-life flying B29s around -- was very good. The flying dinosaurs mixed with
the appropriate puppetry was seemlessly satisfactory... but: The interior shots of the ""bomber"" were obviously
slapped together in a hurry. Plenty of rivot holes, few rivots. The Naviator/Como Officer area looked like the
stewardess area of an old airplane. The cockpit was about as authentic as the one in... no!
It was a l-i-t-t-l-e better than the one seen in that deadful movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE.

The women pilots had flown the bomber from Kansas -- or somewhere there-'bouts -- all the way to Hawaii and
diverted to the dinosaurs' island, without showers, and although their hair DOES look a bit oily, after another
few days, they STILL manage to appear glamourous throughout the film -- THAT part was fine, with ME!

As seen on a larger screen, the caps that the Japanese wore were a modified LL Bean item from about 2005,
complete with the little rubberized bungee cord thing in the back with the black sliding plastic-thingie.
The Japanese soldiers looked fairly clean -- except having dirty EARS!

Remember how heavy a gallon of milk is? Every liquid has a different specific gravity. A barrel of corrosive
acid can weigh as much as 800 lbs! A 55-gallon barrel of gasoline ""only"" weighs around 550 pounds. Yet, in
the film, a woman AND a man pick up at least SEVEN of these, near chin-high, putting them on the tailgate of
the truck...after rolling them up-hill... in the SAND!

The prisoners should have been ""secured"" better.

During the film's time-perod, when the Atomic bomb w-a-s used, the A-bomb in this film is closer to the size of
a LARGE suitcase, while the actual ""Big"" or ""Little"" Boy is closer to that Volkswagon I mentioned earlier.

The sum of the PROs outway the sum of the CONs. Heck. I have NO reason WHY this thriller is so HATED by some,
and loved by others. For a TV-movie --- on a budget --- this was entertainment with a capital "" E "" !!!!!!!

I DO give it two thumbs up while a few other reviewers would most probaby use different fingers. Oh well! It ISN'T
""GONE WITH THE WIND""... it's ""GONE BY THE DINOSAURS""!

Buy it TODAY! If it were an American flag, I'd run it up the flagpole and SALUTE it.",1361836800,9,4216,4.737704918032787
3645122,1,B001HVZO7K,"I am trying to get a handle on the positive reviews for Warbirds here. In my 57 years on this planet I can honestly say this is one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen. To say the movie is destroyed by bad acting would not give sufficient credit to the ludicrous script, pathetic special effects and
dire continuity errors. To see the all female crew of an American B-29 Bomber jump into Japanese Zero fighters and fly them in close formation to attack the Ptero-anodon-dactyls should give you an idea of how stretched credibility is in this film. One of the girls even manages to shoot down a beast while performing a perfect barrel role. All of this without a single perfectly styled hair on their heads being disturbed. The flying Dinosaurs meanwhile have no problem catching up with the Zeros, which, if memory serves me well, had a top speed of around 400mph. That's one for the Paleontologists to check out. The crassness of the script is fully matched by the actors who are less convincing than the cast of a Gerry Anderson 60s puppet serial.
If you want to buy this purely to say you own one of the worst movies ever made, please feel free. There is a kind of perverse logic in that maybe. But, be warned, this is a complete turd of a movie that no amount of polish could put a shine on.",1342051200,2,1309,4.368852459016393

3645124,2,B001HVZO7K,"Warbirds (2008) is a fantasy adventure set in the Pacific during World War II, that features a team of female flyers, a pack of flying dinosaurs, and an atomic bomb.  This effort from the Sci Fi Channel attempts to be deadly serious in tone, but often displays a naivet that is often quite humorous and even exasperating.  Spoilers follow, so continue at your discretion.

Maxine West (Jamie Elle Mann) is the commander of a group of WASP's (Women's Air Force Service Pilots).  After flying a B-29 bomber from Kansas to Honolulu, they are assigned to take a group of soldiers led by OSS (Office of Strategic Service) Colonel Jack Toller (Brian Krause), on a top secret mission.  While in the air battling storm winds, the plane is attacked by a huge winged creature, and with two engines on fire, is forced to land on an island.  The island is the home for a large number of the flying beasts, who apparently enjoy chasing aircraft and feeding on human flesh.

The Americans encounter some Japanese soldiers, and take them prisoner.  They also discover an airfield with some flyable Zero fighter planes.  The Americans attempt to execute a plan where one of the Zero flies to safety, while others fly cover, but the attacking creatures are just too numerous, and force the remaining planes to return to the island.  Eventually it is revealed that the B-29 is carrying an atomic bomb.  Despite the risks, the group decides to make a break in the bomber, with a couple of Zeroes again flying as escorts, to take on the flying reptiles.  With Skipper West piloting the bomber, the film concludes with a remarkable world changing event that rewrites history.

Warbirds is problematic in many ways, as little about the story makes any sense.  The WASP's did not fly combat missions.  The planning for the actual atom bomb raid on Japan was quite extensive, and pilots were fully briefed about the mission.  A B-29 named the Enola Gay, and two other B-29 bombers flew on the mission.  The film's haphazard portrayal of military operations and the chain of command, is not at all realistic and even traitorous.

The Americans capture three Japanese soldiers, and the commander Captain Ozu (Tohoru Masamune), just happens to have been educated at an Ivy League college, speaks English, and to top it all, apparently has some knowledge of nuclear research!  Although the Americans are on a top secret mission, the prisoners are left unrestrained, and kept in a shack with open windows, guarded by one man.  Even after Toller finds Ozu in the plane next to the A-bomb, the prisoners remain unrestrained, and even help repair the plane.  Toller is an idiot, but at least he is trying to follow his orders.  Unlike Maxine West, who is constantly questioning his decisions, and trying to prove she's as tough as a man.  Instead she demonstrates that overconfidence and stupidity isn't excusive to males.

The characters do ridiculous things, like easily rolling heavy barrels of fuel, and then lifting them into a truck.  Then without being tied down, the barrels somehow manage not to roll out of the truck, while it is racing through the jungle.  How an American truck got on the island is a real mystery.  In another scene, Toller is looking at the dinosaurs through binoculars, and then suddenly is dangling over the edge of a cliff, firing his gun.  For more silliness, there are two ridiculous standoffs with guns, and the female pilots always look perfectly made up and glamorous, while flying.  Flying dinosaurs would be a rare sight for most of us, but it seems like no big deal to these people.  The CGI effects for the dinosaurs and the aircraft are passable, but hardly convincing.

Warbirds is a female friendly tale that applies the concept of ""girl power"" to the war in the Pacific.  Like a program intended for children, there is a nave attitude that as long as the girls stick together, all will be right in the world, even if there happens to be a war going on.  The script isn't too concerned with logic or historical accuracy, and often makes the actors look ridiculous.  Toss out the CGI effects, and the film looks like an episode of the 1970's TV program Black Sheep Squadron.  If you're interested in seeing empowered women pilots triumph over some semi-realistic looking flying dinosaurs, and incompetent male leadership, while rewriting  the history of WW II, this is the perfect film.",1319846400,,4398,4.80186170212766

8309818,2,B001HVZO7K,"""Warbirds"" is marginally better than many other movies in the giant CGI monster genre (SyFy, I'm looking at you...), but after a promising start it tried its hand at slow melodrama, and I lost interest around halfway through. It's set in the Pacific theater during World War Two, where in the closing days of the war Japanese troops find dinosaurs in a cave on an atoll. Meanwhile a female American aircrew ferries a B-29 to Tinian on a top secret mission (if you know anything about the bombing of Japan at all, you know where this is going). The aircraft sets are fairly lame, and while there's a lot of CGI, it's definitely not the worst I've seen, and is far above average for this genre and budget combination. Because of a self-important Colonel who is guarding the secret cargo tells them they can't deviate around a thunderstorm, they go through it and - great going Colonel - now they have to make an emergency landing on a Japanese-held island. While enroute they are attacked by giant flying dinosaurs and are leaking fuel, etc. The plane nonsense is fairly poor and the dialogue is even worse. Maxine West (Jamie Elle Mann) is the Aircraft Commander and everyone calls her ""Skipper"". Of course she's brilliant and resourceful. Colonel Toller (Brian Krause) is the stuck up doofus who provides the emotional conflict. The single biggest reason the movie isn't better is because these two characters are just caricatures and have no chemistry whatsoever.

On the Japanese island they find angry Japanese soldiers and a bunch of cranky dinosaurs. The Japanese and Americans eventually cooperate against their mutual enemy, and the girls find that flying the Japanese Zero is no panacea against pterodactyls. After a bit of amateurish subterfuge a Japanese officer figures out that the B-29 is carrying an atomic bomb. (Because that's common knowledge in early 1945...not!) The film suddenly becomes a no nukes piece when West is concerned that using an atomic bomb would be genocide. Like I say, she would have zero way to know anything about nuclear weapons or their effects, so this plotpoint just doesn't work. A highlight of the film is the pterodactyl shoot down at the fuel farm (you know where this is going for the special effects department). After a brief hostage situation is resolved and a Japanese insurrection is quelled, the girls decide to fly the Japanese fighters to Tinian even though they know they don't have the range while West and Toller fly the B-29, engaging in a dogfight along the way. Great plan. This is beyond the realm of the plausible, of course, but it gets more hilarious as Toller dukes it out in the bomb bay with a dinosaur using a fire extinguisher and dropping the bomb. West and one other person survive and dinosaurs learn a valuable lesson about the atom.

I started off liking this film, but it dragged on and the interpersonal dynamics were annoyingly ludicrous. The acting varied from poor to acceptable, and some of the CGI was decent for a film in this class, but the bogus melodrama slant made this a chore to finish.",1485907200,2,3075,4.8
