2750281,5,B000MV8ZZY,This story follows a few fictional families as they experience the aftermath of the tsunami.  This story gives viewers a realistic and heartfelt glimpse of what it must have been like to have been there.,1356825600,,203,4.8

2750284,5,B000MV8ZZY,"This movie is so beautiful, it shows you the different points of views from the different charcters, which I'm a huge fan of. It gives good details, and meaning to the grief and beliefs of different backgrounds and religions. All the actors were wonderful they played their roles so naturally that you were sucked into the movie. You could begin to feel what they were going through and that its a powerful thing to feel and be able to enjoy. The movie was awesome, its a must see.",1283212800,5,481,4.4772727272727275
2750285,4,B000MV8ZZY,"This is a most impressive and realistic recreation of the terrifying consequences of this recent natural disaster. This is no maudlin tear jerker, and fortunately does not rely on special effects for its impact.
It is simply a very well acted drama which probably even underplays what must have been sheer hell, although that is not to say the film in any way falls short of conveying the true tragedy of the event.
It has the even greater merit of having been made for TV, which one does not normally associate with this scale of production. If this interests you, and you missed it on TV, get it on DVD - you won't be sorry.",1222041600,8,626,4.452173913043478
2750286,5,B000MV8ZZY,"This HBO series is so great! The story portrays the Aftermath of the Tsunami that hit Thailand in 2001. It is not a documentary but based on actual events that occurred just after the Tsunami hit. I love documentaries so this series is great, it is so sad though what happened to those poor people. This is a great depiction of the pain and chaos that occurred after the Tsunami.  I think that everyone should watch this film.",1186444800,2,426,4.461538461538462
2750287,5,B000MV8ZZY,Great movie!,1468108800,,12,5.5
2750288,1,B000MV8ZZY,"I wish I could unsee this, I really do. Its got into my head, most of the actors were actually very good (Tim Roth, Chiweto Etifor- sorry I can't spell it, but he is great in it) but it was so annoyingly slow. What a waste of talent. I actually fast-forwarded through the last 20 minutes, just because I couldn't take it anymore and had to see if they find the little girl. (spoiler alert) They don't and it made me hate this film even more!

Whoever played the English woman with the two sons: please find another career. Simply terrible. She made it impossible to care what she was going through in any way, shape or form. Ditto her younger son. So irritating.

I also did not like the depiction of the Thai people as being somehow lesser than the Euro tourists. No bueno.",1466380800,2,774,4.3310344827586205
2750289,1,B000MV8ZZY,"Where do I even start? This movie was a mess. Not even accurate whatsoever... And it made my baby boy Sam pill his spaghetti o's all over his high chair. Do you know how HARD it is to calm a crying child? And CLEAN SPAGHETII O's OFF A CHAIR at the same time? No. No you dont. My husband won't let me have a weekly allowance anymore because of my foolish purchase, i just wanted a nice family movie for our tri weekly movie night. I hate the ocean.",1465776000,,447,4.033707865168539
2750290,1,B000MV8ZZY,I think I would have enjoyed the movie however the tape played part way through and then skipped or stopped entirely so bad I never got to finish the movie.  Extremely disappointed.,1454457600,2,181,4.65625
2750291,5,B000MV8ZZY,"There are other movies about the 2004 disaster, but this is so much better than the others. Many different people are portrayed throughout the week or so following the catastrophe, including not only European tourists, but locals, government officials, press, etc. There are no 'Hollywood' endings here ( I use this term generically ). It is perfectly acted, shot, written. Just a very great movie that will stay with you.",1453075200,2,422,5.042857142857143

2750296,5,B000MV8ZZY,I saw this a few years ago in Television and was absolutely surprised to find it at amazon. The acting is good and the story very sad.,1413590400,,134,4.0
2750297,5,B000MV8ZZY,"If you live in an area with the possibility of an earthquake + tsunami or know someone who does, please watch this documentary.  It is the closest thing I've seen to a ""manual"" on how to deal with the aftermath of a tsunami.",1412467200,,224,4.209302325581396

2750303,5,B000MV8ZZY,"I thought this movie was so well done and the actors were amazing. Natural disasters are so unbelievably heartbreaking, but I think we all need to watch something like this every now and then to help us not take things for granted.",1375574400,4,231,4.523809523809524
2750304,5,B000MV8ZZY,We know the story but the acting in this movie was excellent. Very accurate drama of the worst natural event to hit the earth in a hundred years.,1374883200,,145,4.214285714285714

8172784,5,B000MV8ZZY,Good account about what happened after that horrendous tsunami.,1507593600,,63,6.111111111111111
8172785,2,B000MV8ZZY,I really wanted to like this show but found that I could not bring myself to watch past the first few minutes of the second episode. Watching a father abandon the search for his daughter post-tsunami to escort a half-dead stranger to God knows where was unbearable. As were the countless closeups and long drawn out scenes of him just standing there in a stupor. But to then watch the mother abandon their daughter for a strange little girl as well was insanity. What is this even about? How to not care about loved ones in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Why strangers matter more than family? Bad acting. Even Tim Roth was bad in this. Nothing compelling about any of these characters. Bad script. Worse director. What a waste.,1506297600,,734,4.6106870229007635
8172786,5,B000MV8ZZY,I loved the movie but the CD was damaged and wouldn't play.,1503532800,,59,4.0
8172787,5,B000MV8ZZY,Superbly done with great acting by Hugh Bonneville from Downton Abbey and the wonderful Toni Collette.  Well worth watching.,1502323200,,124,5.526315789473684

8172790,1,B000MV8ZZY,The movie Tsunami skipped right from the beginning and then we did not have an option to get another one upon return; just a refund.,1484265600,,132,4.32
8172791,5,B000MV8ZZY,The Tsunami that devastated  coastal Thailand and changed forever the lives of the people that survived. The story line was accurate and the acting was superb. It did however reveal the strength of people helping others in the depths of their despair.,1471046400,,251,4.976190476190476
8172792,5,B000MV8ZZY,Another side of the story. I like it because gave another perspective. The money that the hotel industry moves without stopping and think who they hurt its upsetting. Of course that is not the only industry that behaves like that but in this case it was.,1468368000,,254,4.543478260869565
