2891595,5,B0000VLLNY,This was the cutest movie.  Am so impressed with Charlotte Church's acting and Craig Ferguson's writing.  I had only ever seen him on Drew Carey and this is quite the departure.  That thick Scottish accent is very appealing.  Where's the soundtrack?!,1075507200,2,250,5.024390243902439
2891596,4,B0000VLLNY,"Thousands of low budget movies are released on DVD/Video every year. Most, without fanfare. This film won several awards, at a number of Film Festivals, throughout North America last year. Those audiences loved this British import. They laughed and then laughed some more.  But I guess the lack of violence, sex, drugs and gore can kill a film's chance for financial success. So money is not spent to promote the film and it has gone directly to DVD/Video. What a shame. It also has a plot!!! It tells a story and has a purpose.
This was written and directed by Craig Ferguson...his first venture on that side of the camera. You know Craig, he has appeared on the Drew Carry Show in the US but he is known mostly in the UK.  He had a new acting talent in mind, when he wrote the role of Olivia...Charlotte Church. This movie is NOT about Charlotte Church but it is her acting debut in the movie business. Up until now, she has been better known as a singing phenomenon...""Voice of An Angel"". Those of us familiar with her vivacious personality, can better appreciate the fact, that she plays a totally different person in her role as Olivia. We also get a chance to hear her sing...worth the price of the DVD alone. The other cast of characters are also experienced actors, one of which you will recognize...from a coffee commercial on US TV several years ago.
This is the type of film that leaves you smiling at the end. You are sorry it is over. You will find yourself pulling it off your bookshelf over the years and watching it again. This is not a Disney type film. The language is raw at times and we also get to see more of Craig Ferguson than we might want...and I do not mean his screen time is too long.
No one will win an Oscar or a Brit or any other fancy award. There are flaws and Craig's first attempt at writing and directing, demonstrates a need for polish.
So, just enjoy this movie for what it is...a movie that makes you feel good....nothing wrong with that folks.",1075420800,4,1984,4.432876712328767

2891615,5,B0000VLLNY,This is a great movie I loved it from beginning to end.  The characters were real and the dialog was a little edgy but funny side of life.  Charlotte Church singing was awesome (It would have more wonderful had she sang one or two more songs).  Family movie on most levels.  I gave it a 5 stars because of the storyline and acting and the movie wasn't bleeping out words.  I could invite others to watch this movie with me and enjoy it.  I've bought 5 movies and given them to others who have enjoyed just like I did.  The DVD arrived in a timely manner and it was in very good condition.

I've been a fan of Charlottes from the beginning; I have all her CDs on my iPad, iPod, etc.
...and I read the story of her life ...in the biography...  What a beautiful and talented lady
Then came ""Issues and Tissues""....with the Sony / Charlotte real life story.  I was so sad ...
BUT NOW, I understand that like the story on this ""I'll Be There"" DVD.... we may expect to see,
and hear her again in real life.
She remains one of my favorites in singing and in beauty of person...
I was delighted with this film and still, her voice is magic and uniqully lovely to hear.

2891624,5,B0000VLLNY,I don't believe this movie ever received much attention but it should have.  It is off-beat but highly entertaining.  If you don't know Craig Ferguson you're in for a treat.  It has some of the best music I've heard in film and parts of it are hilarious.,1387929600,,254,4.361702127659575

Charlotte Church plays his daughter (the result of a one night stand). She does a wonderful job and her voice is beautiful. Considered a ""B"" movie, I happened to catch it on TV and then bought the DVD. It is a light hearted movie with romance, comedy, and a touch of drama. The acting is fair-good. It moves along nicely, grabs your attention and holds you interested until the end. I was particularly interested because I had a connection to the movie being in a band, and growing up with a father in the music industry.

2891628,4,B0000VLLNY,"This is a very predictable story but is charmingly done. All the stars do a good job including Charlotte Church.  Sad to say that she apparently never reached her potential. Started out so gloriously when she was very young and now from what I've seen is trying to be as outrageous as she can be hoping for some sort of success. I don't know what kind she is looking for.  One fault in the movie is there is not nearly enough of her beautiful singing and way, way too much of loud, not very good rock and roll by men old enough to know better than to make such spectacles of themselves.  I call this noise.  Not Music.  But, it's an enjoyable little movie and I think almost anyone would like it. Just hit mute when the rock and roll starts.",1382400000,,741,4.226950354609929
2891629,3,B0000VLLNY,"Light hearted romance,comedy, musical. Craig Fegiston has enlighten and introduced a talented voice with Charotte and conveied true feeling of the missing father.

2891630,4,B0000VLLNY,"This movie really got the short end of the stick. It had a very short, very limited theater release in Britain, and remains unknown to most Americans, except for dedicated fans of the personnel herein. The lack of the financial ""blockbuster"" factor has spurred some critics on to complain that a ""straight to video"" release (by the way, this actually was NOT one) can't possibly be any good. Some have ripped it for being a little shallow, but remember that this is a comedy drama; shallowness is inevitable in some form with comedies.

We can never be sure what to expect out of singers who turn their attention to movies, but Charlotte Church does a fair job of it. Yes, she has some lovely music bits, but her acting is decent as well (even if her character is written to be limited and predictable). You will also remember the strong supporting cast. Craig Ferguson shows a great deal of general silliness as absentee father Paul, and even those who are not familiar with him will find him endearing and hilarious. Jemma Redgrave is the tough-as-nails (yet brittle-as-porcelain) mother, Rebecca. Joss Ackland, although 75 years old at the time of this film, is the brilliantly hearty and eccentric Evil Edmonds, and Ralph Brown is perfect sidekick Digger. We also get to see a deliciously slimy Anthony Head, funny townie Ian McNeice, and a surprisingly straight-faced Imelda Staunton. In short, they really couldn't have tried much harder to get a better assembly of faces together. Trevor Jones supplies some stunning instrumental music that I desperately wish was available on CD.

It's true that the plot is neither very special nor particularly original, but that doesn't mean it's unbearable. This wasn't meant to be a terribly gritty and groundbreaking movie. There are no spectacular camera tricks, no glittering special effects, no huge story twists. This is simply a family drama (21st-century style) with a massive heaping of comedy.

If you appreciate good British comic actors and fun music, give this one a chance!",1381363200,,2032,4.970588235294118

2891632,4,B0000VLLNY,I like Charlotte Church. Her voice like an angel. Interesting of both parents. I know mother always protect her daughter.

2891636,5,B0000VLLNY,I loved the characters and the story.  The ONLY thing I didn't love was that there is one joke in the movie that they explained before they 'told' it; sort of insults our intelligence as viewers. That was not a big enough flaw to give it less than five stars.,1368144000,,259,4.18

2891642,4,B0000VLLNY,"This is a sweet film about awkward family relationships, music, recovery.  The dialogue is full of subtle one liners and there is quite a bit of physical humor.

2891643,3,B0000VLLNY,"This vehicle designed to promote Welsh songbird Charlotte Church does a great disservice to her.  Plain and simple she can't act.  The central story involving an aging rock star bonding with a daughter he never knew he had is light years beyond Church's scope.  It's as though Craig Ferguson is feebly attempting to interact with a wooden Indian.  Okay, she may not be able to act but at least we have her singing.  That's even a letdown.  She's called upon here to warble MOR dishwater and she completely butchers the Four Tops' ""I'll Be There"".  All is not lost, however.  Despite it being somewhat an upward climb Ferguson does deliver a terrific performance straddling between the comic and the pathos without being saccharine.  Joss Acklund is also great as Church's septugenarian rock 'n' roller grandfather.  As a footnote after this mild misfire Ferguson is now a fixture of late night television in America and a recently naturalized citizen to boot.  Church is probably about twenty-five now and is due for a comeback.  Stick to singing, Charlotte.",1320969600,,1058,4.948863636363637

It was good the first time I saw it long ago, But after seeing it again,
I seem to come back to it over and over. Craig Ferguson is always a kick
to watch and I wish he had made more movies. Charlotte Church also pulls her
weight here. She is a real beauty with a voice to match. There is a nice
Welsh/Scottish feel to the movie and it leaves you feeling upbeat. It is
a comedy about a famous rock star that discovers he has a daughter he
was never told about and her mother who believes that he just blew her off-
not knowing that he had lost her and then dedicated an album to her.
Lead by Ferguson, the rest of the cast all contribute great comedic chops.

2891649,5,B0000VLLNY,"'I'll be there' has become one of my favourite movies since first seeing it on TV several years ago. Starring Craig Ferguson (from 'The Drew Carey Show') and introducing Charlotte Church (aka The Voice of an Angel),'I'll be there' won't win too many awards for great writing or plot development but if you want some light-hearted family entertainment with some memorable music and a few good laughs along the way then you could do a lot worse than spending a couple of hours watching this film.

Charlotte Church's acting debut is solid enough and her singing is simply awesome. Charlotte's interpretation of the Gershwin's 'Summertime' is breathtaking and arguably the highlight of the film. Craig Ferguson puts in an amusing performance as washed up 1980s pop star Paul Kerr who discovers he has a daughter Olivia (Church) from a one-night stand. They meet for the first time when Olivia's mum learns that Kerr has been in hospital and it's suggested they meet. You can see the ending coming from a hundred miles but it's fun getting there all the same.

Also worth noting is the performance of Anthony Stewart Head (Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) who plays Paul Kerr's sleazy and useless manager.",1289952000,,1203,4.892156862745098

2891657,4,B0000VLLNY,"Followers of Welsh classical singer Charlotte Church don't necessarily feel the same way about Craig Ferguson, but this little movie serves as a happy meeting ground for both sorts of admirers, all respective parties mingling and having a pint or four and perhaps affably making disparaging remarks about Americans. Craig Ferguson, himself a musican in his younger years, writes, directs, and stars in I'LL BE THERE, a watchable 2003 family dramedy about a washed-up aging rock star (Ferguson) who, while wrongly consigned to a psychiatric ward, learns that he has a 16-year-old daughter (Church). And so cue the familiar plot points.

As a brawny, brawny man, I've only ever caught Charlotte Church on the telly by accident, but I'm not about to deny that the girl is gifted with an amazing singing voice. On the other hand, as a brawny, brawny man who also stays up really late, I frequently tune in to Craig Ferguson's late night talk show. I'm quite appreciative of his offbeat, amiably irreverent brand of wit and humor (I think his opening monologues, offhandedly delivered with that Scottish burr of his, are often little gems). I don't know that it's so surprising, but Ferguson and Church do well together onscreen. The film's focus is most definitely on the father-daughter angle, with a mere dollop thrown in of a romance between Ferguson and Jemma Redgrave, who plays the mother of Church's character. Charlotte Church, in her cinematic debut, performs as if this weren't her cinematic debut, and I only wish that her character were given more things to do (she doesn't even have a boyfriend, which is almost sacrilege in films like this).

What keeps me from giving this film a fully extended thumbs up is the leisurely pacing and the story's predictability. The happy ending is a mere formality. The only real speed bump to the impending familial bliss is that the mother, concerned that her daughter's heart may get broken, adamantly forbids her daughter and her suddenly discovered dad from getting to know each other. Anthony Stewart Head (Giles from BUFFY) also skulks on the screen as Ferguson's sleazy manager. Will the rowdy boozy rock god quit his yen for the sauce and sort out his other issues? Will the mother thaw out and rekindle a past romance (it was actually more of a groupie fling)? Will Ferguson and Church get a chance to rock out? What do you think?

Apropos of nothing, I somehow get a kick out of the rock star's keeping a llama on his lawn. I think, partly, it's because of the llama's name, which is Dolly (heh).

What I think is that I enjoyed this movie, despite its lack of momentum. Craig Ferguson is very agreeable and occasionally dispenses funny one-liners, and I think that's really him playing the piano and guitar. Charlotte Church gets to sing, but not often enough, and I did get irked that, other than ""Summertime,"" the musical performances weren't allowed to finish out. It's a bit startling to hear Church branching out to pop music, but she mostly handles it well. However, her duet with Ferguson at the end is too short and her voice somehow gets drowned out. For those who like to soak in refinement, she does cover a classical piece in the opening scene, so that's a chance to elevate a cultured pinkie. Also keep an eye on Josh Ackland who plays a pub-performing rockabilly musician and Church's grandfather. Those who cater to grandpa's music generally tend to raise another sort of finger.",1248566400,2,3450,4.83248730964467

2891660,4,B0000VLLNY,"If you enjoy British Comedy and good music from both the rock and roll and current day eras, you might want to give ""I'll be There"" a watch.

The premise, 80's hairband rocker Paul Kerr (Ferguson) crashes his bike through a window of his Welsh mansion.  He wakes up in the hospital with what the docs describe as 'superficial damage.'  The thing is, the hospital he wakes up in is a psych ward. The docs think his drunken escapade is a cry for help.

He gets that help  and then some.  Rebecca (Gemma Redgrave), who was a 48-hour-stand back in the 80's, shows up to tell him they had a daughter.  Digger (Ralph Brown), the drummer in the Love Rats his old band, shows up to help him sober up.

Once Paul straightens out his life, he makes an attempt to know his daughter Olivia (Church).  No surprise she's a singer.  Musical talent runs on both sides of the family.  Her Grand-dad is 70 and still touring with his rock and roll band.

There's not a lot of teenage angst here.  As a matter of fact, young Olivia seems to be the best grounded of the lot.  She knows what she wants from her life and she's doing her best to get it without hurting anyone.  I'm definitely impressed by Charlotte Church's acting in this role.  Also, you get to hear several songs from her, including:

Reach Out/I'll Be there
Summertime (from Porgy and Bess)
In Hebrid Seas
Would I Know?

The film's going to give you more than one good laugh from the psych ward to the old rocker's backyard.  ""I'll be There"" is one film you may have missed, because it appears to be somewhat low-budget, but if you enjoy humor or Church's singing, you may want to give this one a watch.

If you wish to see Charlotte Church be an angel... and sing the music that she has become famous for... forget that.  She plays a daughter with a golden voice hidden from her mother.  She sings a classical piece as well as George Gershwin's Summertime aria in a manner to rival Ella Fitzgerald.  That is great praise for a Welsh lady, singing a Southern American classic.

All of the the actors were awesome in their British quirkiness.  The ensemble of actors brought this script to life and obviously all had great fun doing it.  For most of them I do not think they were acting.  They were themselves, dressed up to play and work with friends.

2891668,4,B0000VLLNY,"I put off watching this movie for some time.  I've had a hard time accepting the fact that the Charlotte Church so many of us fell in love with, seemingly one of the last remaining bastions of wholesomeness and all-around purity in this world, has caught a virulent case of Britney-itis (and has actually sunk even lower than Britney in a fair number of ways) and is seemingly lost to us forever.  I'm really quite saddened by the whole situation.  Nevertheless, I can still adore the girl Charlotte Church used to be, and, happily, there are traces of that girl immortalized forever in this film.  I was actually quite surprised by I'll Be There; Charlotte's no Jodie Foster, but she's a far better actress than I expected her to be, and this really and truly is a good movie.  It doesn't take us anywhere we've haven't been before, but it's a fun ride.

Charlotte plays Olivia Edmonds, a teenaged girl who finds out that her father is actually famed aging rock star Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson), just after he makes headlines for driving his motorcycle out a second story window of his home.  Olivia's mother never told her the truth about her father because the relationship was short-lived (Kerr never even knew he had a daughter) and she resents the fact that her own still-rocking father was never there for her growing up.  She wants Olivia to join her hairdressing business and stay away from musicians at all costs.  We all know Charlotte has the best singing voice in the whole bloody kingdom, but her mother does not realize just how talented her daughter Olivia really is.  Anyway, Olivia and Kerr slowly develop a relationship with one another, helped immeasurably by Kerr's decision to stop drinking - but dear old Mum wants nothing to do with the man she's obviously still in love with.  Everything comes to a head when Olivia's talent is made manifest, and you can probably fill in the rest yourself.

As I said, I'll Be There doesn't break any new ground, but it's a feel-good movie that succeeds extremely well.  Craig Ferguson makes it all work and injects a lot of comedy into everything he does.  As writer, director, and star, this really is Ferguson's baby and should have enjoyed more success than it achieved.  It even supplies the somewhat disconcerting sight of the Buffyverse's Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) playing a smarmy music agent - earrings and all.  Of course, you also have the added attraction of several Charlotte Church songs (even if they do represent her early foray into pop).  All told, I'll Be There is a surprisingly entertaining, heart-warming motion picture - and those are few and far between these days.",1117238400,16,2657,4.7663755458515285
2891669,5,B0000VLLNY,"A low budget film, yes, but it really works and I really enjoyed it which surprised me no end.

Once again a plot that is not rocket sciene which is good when you want something ease on the brain to watch.

A washed-up 80's pop star Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) who moves to Wales on a spur of the moment decision and in doing so discovers that he has a teenage daughter, Olivia, (Charlotte Church) living in his new backyard.

Olivia was the result of a weekend affair he had with her teenage mother during the height of his fame and his arrival in the small Welsh town unsettles the orderly but now very boring life of his ex-lover Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave).

We are treated to fun galore as Paul tries to get to know his daughter whilst trying to woo her mother back into his arms.  Olivia in turn is having her own problems with her mother, Rebecca doesn't want her to become involved in the music industry, her own father is an aging rocker who is always on the road with his band and the man she loved seemingly abandoned her for his career.

Anthony Head (Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as Paul's foul breathed manager is a treat, there are some great funny moments, like when Paul finds out that his best friend's girlfriend is Scottish and she just happens to be called Nessie, the scene on the motorbike when Paul and Rebecca race to London to ""rescue"" their daughter is hilarious, you can see the sparks of attraction flying between them and the scene in the hospital is hysterical along with the pub scene when the locals worry about the possibility of ""Americas moving in,"" not to mention the soundtrack to the film is lovely, especially with all the songs that Charlotte Church brings to life with her glorious voice.

This is a lovely film with a cast of fine characters; look out for Joss Ackland as Rebecca's rock-a-billy father, Phyllida Law as Olivia's teacher and Imelda Staunton in rippingly good form as the po-faced Dr Bridget.",1116720000,21,1951,4.525568181818182
2891670,3,B0000VLLNY,"Though you may see the face of Welsh starlet Charlotte Church on the DVD frontcover, 'I'll Be There' belongs to Scottish comic Craig Furguson.  In fact, it not only stars him, but it is directed and co-written by him.  The film also shows you some of the comparatively little-known but most talented actors.

The film's premise is similar to that of 'What a Girl Wants' starring Amanda Bynes.  Well, this is the established pattern.  You know, a cute girl Charlotte Church (who likes singing very much ... why not?) comes to know the existence of her long-lost father Craig Furguson, about whom she had not known anything until then, and for some reasons or other the daughter goes to the daddy's house, ignoring her mom's advice, and so on and on.

And in 'I'll Be There,' the daddy is a former rock singer, one Paul Kerr who was popular in the 80s while daughter Olivier is a singer with an angelic voice, most likely heard in a chapel.  Because of his 'bipolar' behavior after the suicidal jump from the second storey of his house (riding a motorcycle, after smashing a guitar in 'The Who' fashion), Paul Kerr is sent to a mental institute.  That incident starts the belated father-daughter relation between Paul and Olivier, and also re-unites him and his ex-love (and Olivier's mother) Rebecca played by excellent Jemma Redgrave (Vanessa's niece, by the way).

The comedy is a bit slow, and might need patience at first, but Ferguason's low-key comic timing will eventually win over you.  Though the story is nothing unique, the small and awfully silly things are said and done by the great cast including Joss Ackland, Ralph Brown, and Imelda Staunton.  Perhaps Ms. Staunton is best known for her turn in 'Vera Drake,' but she is very good at comedies (see 'Shakespeare in Love'), and her embarrassed face before the ex-rocker in hospital is delightful to see.  And don't forget Phyllida Law, mother of Emma Thompson.

As to Charlotte Church herself, she is not as bad as you might think, for she is not required to do much.  One regrettable thing is that the songs included here are not as memorable as they should be.  I'm not questioning her talent as singer, but except the chorus version of The Four Tops classic soul music (yes, see the film's title), I didn't find the songs particularly good.  But anyway, you can hear her songs somewhere else.",1114905600,11,2358,4.728606356968215
2891671,2,B0000VLLNY,"There's a reason why they talk about the ""Voice of an Angel"" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut ""I'll Be There"" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.

Seventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.

The problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps.

""I'll Be There"" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because ""I'll Be There"" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting.

With a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills.

The best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.

Miss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. ""I'll Be There,"" but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can.",1112832000,3,2471,4.554054054054054
2891672,4,B0000VLLNY,"After a drunken accident beginning with a dance in ya underpants a la Tom Cruise in Risky Business, rock star Paul Kerr, formerly with the Love Rats, a hard rock outfit with fluffed out 80's hairdo, discovers that he had fathered a child through a woman who attended a concert of his in 1987.  That child, Olivia, is now sixteen (guess who?) and has a gift for singing, and it's only because of his accident, that her mother, Rebecca, still nursing a bitter grudge and a broken heart, reluctantly admits that Paul is her father.

Rebecca's bitterness comes from the fact that she wrote Paul letters that she was pregnant, letters never answered.  Furthermore, her father, a tough, bearded, septuagenarian who plays 50's rock and roll and blues, goes by the stage name Evil Edmonds, fronts a band called the Beelze-Bobs, was on the road too much to be a good parent to her, and as a result, Rebecca is barely civil with her own father.  In fact, Rebecca was born on the tour bus the Bobs use for their gigs!  She is a single mother and also an entrepreneur, running a hairdressing salon named Cheeky Chops (nice name!) with a gay colleague.

Paul's accident leads him to turn his life around.  The Love Rats' ex-drummer, a chipper Australian named Digger, hears the news and tries to get his bandmate off the wagon.  Olivia, who wants to sing instead of doing nails and hair, visits her father to get to know him better.  However, her mother associates the music business with the same atmosphere that led to her pregnancy and protective of Olivia, forbids Paul to see their daughter.  After all, where was he when she was raising Olivia?

The best way to get to know her father is to listen to her music, and Olivia buys the Love Rats' hit album, Lost Woman, the rear of which has the dedication ""To Rebecca,"" meaning that Paul did care, but Rebecca sees that as a sign that Olivia's traveling down the same road as her father.

As an acting debut, it's not much for Charlotte Church, but she acquits herself in that she doesn't play the usual pouting, rebellious teenager railing against Mum, Dad, and Grandpa.  She's cute driving around in her pink moped with matching helmet to boot.  Her Welsh accent comes through, not a debit as she's playing a half-Scot.  And oh yes, does Charlotte sing!  Apart from ""Summertime"" from Porgy and Bess, which can be found on her eponymous album, she does three new songs, ""In Hebrid Seas,"" the creamy Mariah-like ballad ""Would I Know?"", and an acoustic and full-blown versions of the Four Tops ""Reach Out (I'll Be There).""  That latter is Rebecca's favourite song, hence the title.  Walter Afanasieff of Mariah fame produced and arranged those new songs, with Diane Warren penning ""Would I Know?""  and if Charlotte decides to record again, that sounds like a logical next step in her career.

I was used to seeing Jemma Redgrave as the progressive, romantic idealist female doctor in the Victorian era series Bramwell.  Quite a change for her, especially with blonde hair.  As Rebecca, she does well portraying someone who is still stung by the past, which affects the expectations she has for her daughter.  Ralph Brown (Digger) has a great rapport with Craig Ferguson (Paul), and interacts well with Charlotte.  But it's Joss Ackland as Evil Esmond who's the real surprise.  After playing heavies (White Mischief, Lethal Weapon 2, Sherlock Holmes:Copper Beeches), he's quite a delight as a rock-and-roller still singing songs like the Leiber-Stoller standard ""Trouble.""  And that's Phyllida Law, Emma Thompson's mother, as Ms. Williams, Charlotte's vocal coach.

This cute comedy sadly didn't make it my local theatre.  Given that it was Charlotte Church's film debut, I would've gone on opening day.  Not a classic by any means, but it's still a delightful number benefiting from the performances, and some funny lines all around.

Craig Ferguson was aboslutely brilliant in his role and wrote a fantastic script, he has the best lines.  Jemma Redgrave wasn't the best I had seen.  It was painful to watch her sometimes.  As for Charlotte, she was awkward in parts but mostly, she fitted into her role well.  Other great characters, Ralph Brown and the bands manager (from buffy) were also great fun to watch.  This film is just so charming I don't understand why it has done so bad.  Its a film for anyone, but uses explicit language a lot (mainly from the rockers).  There are laugh out loud moments and the directing I thought was really thoughtful.  The best scene of the whole film is the first one, with the mixture of Olivias singing in the church and her long lost Father rocking about alone in his mansion drunk off his face.  Its not a perfect piece of cinema of course, it has flaws, like some of the acting (ok, just Jemma Redgrave) and Craig putting flashbacks in but its an original british film which should be appreciated by all, not just Charlotte fans.",1078272000,7,1290,4.419491525423729
