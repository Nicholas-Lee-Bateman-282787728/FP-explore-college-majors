It's just as entertaining today as it was then. The only major defect is the introductory material that you can't skip over. I don't mean the FBI/Interpol warnings, rather the long intro to each disk, which is time-wasting, irrelevant, and annoying. Also, if you screw up and don't select English for the dialogue (There are no subtitles.), you have to go back and sit through the whole bloody thing again. Whoever designed this ought to be tied in a chair and made to watch only the intro for all eternity.",1349395200,4,679,4.528455284552845

8045126,4,B00076WO2Y,"A very entertaining animated series that shows the history of the world since the prehistory to the twentieth century. The same characters recur in different eras: for example, Pierre, one of the main characters, appears in one episode as a Persian warrior, then in another as a Roman slave, then as a Frankish peasant, and so on. I saw the series around 1980, when I was about 12, and it definitely awakened in me an interest in history. Now, if one can criticize the series for something is for its Eurocentrism: the history of the world in this series is mostly the history of Europe (with a few exceptions, one of the most intriguing episodes was the one that dealt with the birth of Islam; in deference to the faith, Muhammad was always shown from behind). Now, an interesting fact: here, in Argentina, when it was initially shown in 1980, the military dictatorship was in power, and under pressure from the Catholic Church, the series was taken off the air halfway through. The church apparently didn't like that evolution was favored in the first episode, and neither they appreciated the portrayal of the church during the Middle Ages. I swear this is really true: I remember it quite vividly, because I really liked the series and I was angry when they put it off the air.",1180396800,3,1281,4.672566371681416
