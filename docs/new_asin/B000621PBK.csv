8170822,4,B000621PBK,"I always loved Horacio's playing. But sometimes he can get a little overwhelming! Despite how awesome of a drummer he is, this is a short video (only an hour and 3 minutes). Not much at all for the price you pay. But even so, I was astounded by the musicianship of guest Marc Quinones and Horacio Hernandez. For all El Negro's fans: Get it!",1279584000,,340,4.328125
8170823,5,B000621PBK,"El Negro is so masterful and relaxed. It makes you want to watch him over and over. The camera work in this DVD is pretty good, although I wish it would have just stayed on him and his hands, but you get to see alot of his playing technique and his personal interviews are great because you get a sense of what a warm person he is.",1201392000,,331,3.955223880597015
