8030254,1,B0002PUDNM,"WARNING: all 5 reviews of this DVD obviously are fake, as the reviewers' account names clearly are bogus, and none of the reviewers ever reviewed anything else.  Why an attorney would have to create fake reviews in support of a DVD regarding a subject in which she purportedly has such great skills and experience is beyond me.  Buyer beware.

Edit: I'm shocked--shocked!--that this review got a downvote.",1331683200,,405,5.014925373134329

8030257,5,B0002PUDNM,great video for someone contemplating a separation or divorce or custody case in NY,1102982400,,83,5.0
8030258,5,B0002PUDNM,"I really enjoyed the video, the music was entertaining and the various cuts to average people going through a divorce helped me to understand I was not alone, and that the rules of law could protect me and not harm me!

I though Lisa kept my attention throughout the entire two hour presentation as she is down to earth, lively, attractive and best of all knowledgable.  I lent it to a friend who is also going through a divorce and she was relieved to learn about her custodial rights and received some good information as to how to go about settling her case in a realistic fashion without unnecessary expense and undue court intervention. She and her husbnand watched it together and it really helped them to come to terms on alot of issues..they both felt the  video's information  helped them to take the revenge out of the equation and settle it like a business agreement which was really great as my friend was afraid that hearing it from her, her husband would not believe it!",1099699200,2,984,4.573863636363637
8030259,5,B0002PUDNM,"I watched this dvd several times and was able to learn what I was in for if I were to get divorced.

A must purchase for anyone who can not afford a lawyer at this time but just wants some general consumer information on ""what to expect if you are expecting"" a divorce.  The material is easily assessable, as entertaining as it can get, considering the subject matter.  It is also a valuable resource for couples contemplating marriage because then the couple can go to a lawyer somewhat educated as to their concerns and draft a pre-nup that covers those areas of concern in case the marriage does not pan out as planned.  I was able to skip from subject to subject with ease with respect to learning about the areas of interest that concerned me. I loved it.",1092700800,3,760,4.446043165467626
