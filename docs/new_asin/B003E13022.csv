4112617,2,B003E13022,Very cheaply made for the price.  My daughter wore this day before the leather strap broke.  After a month it has broken several times and will need to be replaced.,1351209600,,164,4.433333333333334
4112618,5,B003E13022,"I LOVE this show it is packed with Passion and Love and absolute JOY! I have taken it to my 1st graders class to watch as I gave them a pizza party and they left the room full and saying ""You can do anything if you just BELIEVE."" I have bought ""One Ocean."" and it is a good show but lacks the Passion and Joy of Believe. I hope in time Sea World will find a way to forge the AWE of BeliEVE and create a similar show even if the trainers can no longer go in the water.  IF you can find a trainer to do that or creater than you have found a MASTER Of MaGiC. Believe is magical. We will never see a show to that level of MAJESTY but a closer second would be something to strive for. I watch this video at least once every other week it never gets boring it never loses it's greatness.",1338508800,3,781,3.8509316770186337
4112619,5,B003E13022,"We got this DVD at Sea World San Antonio last month in the clearnace bin.  This is a recording of the older show that they no longer perform.  After watching this DVD at home, we felt really diappointed that the new show ""One Ocean"" is not nearly as good as ""Believe"".  What a shame that the trainers no longer perform in the water with the whales.  What I love most about this DVD is the behind the scenes bonus footage where you get to see what it's like to be a trainer at Sea World.  It is very inspiring and heartwarming.  I actually like this segment of the DVD better than the main feature!  All in all, I love this entire DVD and so does our 4 year old son.",1319328000,3,665,4.069230769230769
4112620,5,B003E13022,"This video is absolutely wonderful and the price is unbelievable!!! i have given it to family and friends and they all just love it!!! i watch it at least once a day;puts me in a great mood!!! Tears for Dawns performance;then such laughter when the soaking part comes on. Also interesting parts about how Believe was made,and how the trainers work with them!!! You will love it!!!!",1304985600,,381,4.701492537313433
4112621,5,B003E13022,"Since the new ""One Ocean"" Shamu show will be starting at all Sea World locations this spring, I thought I would get one of these DVD's to remember the fantastic ""Believe"" show that we have enjoyed over the past couple years. The footage of the show is entirely from the Florida location.  It is amazing to see the trainers interact with the whales and the bonus features showing behind-the-scenes work is very interesting.  My only ""complaint"" with this DVD is that, as entertaining as it is, the show in this video is not the show I have seen several times - although I wish I could have seen this version.  (Since the tragic death of a trainer, the others no longer get in the water with the whales - at least for the shows.)  Still...it is a wonderful reminder of our visits to Sea World and we are looking forward to the new show!",1304640000,,834,4.396103896103896
8395129,5,B003E13022,I have been looking for this DVD for a while now and I am so happy I finally found it.  As soon as I open the package I watched it.  It reminds me of all of the fun times I had watching the trainers in the water with the whales.  I also loved how it showed behind the scenes clips and the making of the show.,1463356800,,308,3.6363636363636362
8395130,5,B003E13022,I really love how all these PETArds and Blackfish heroes give this 0 Stars because they are butthurt. SeaWorld cares about these animals. We need zoological facilities more than ever now due the habitat loss and pollution. GO SEAWORLD!,1458086400,,235,5.051282051282051

8395136,1,B003E13022,I got this as a prize and I threw it away. I cannot begin to imagine what this must sound like bouncing off the walls of a cement tank. The orcas hearing is super sensitive. We should let the prisoners go. They did enough time.,1397692800,3,227,4.066666666666666
