8722389,5,B010GJBO0E,"I've studied finger cymbals with Karim so I had a good idea what this DVD would be like.  He teaches a bit differently than other drummers and finger cymbal players I'm familiar with and it can be a real challenge to follow him but I think he's worth it.
He includes a lot of sound advice about musicality, (another class I have taken with him) and that is very valuable to the belly dancer no matter what style of cymbal playing.
There are other DVDs that are better at helping dancers integrate zill playing with dance movement (and a living breathing teacher is always best); but this DVD should be in every dancer's library who really cares about music and musicality.
Karim has a wonderful quirky sense of humor and much to offer the American belly dancer, but don't expect to absorb his style immediately. A lot of practice is involved and you may have to change the way you count your music as well.",1449273600,7,906,4.490909090909091
8722390,5,B010GJBO0E,"So refreshing!  Karim takes you beyond patterns and teaches you how to play like a musician!  He reviews and explains each of the most common rhythms encountered in Arabic music and helps the viewer feel comfortable playing with the music, and not on top of it.  Karim also covers valuable topics on etiquette when playing zills/sagat.  His teaching style is relaxed, easy to follow and inviting.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!!",1439337600,9,424,5.176470588235294
