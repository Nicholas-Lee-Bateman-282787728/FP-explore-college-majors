5109201,3,B007RO8X1U,"And I get to play yet another round of...

""What Were The Producers Thinking?"" or ""Who Did She Shag To Get The Job?""

Middling B-Movie entertainment. This SciFi Weekend rotational flick would've been so much more enjoyable had the filmmakers cast an actual thirty-something for the lead role of the scientist and not a 40+ year old actress desperately trying to pass herself off as a decade younger.

And, following the theme of age inappropriateness, hired a teen to play a teen. Instead of vainly attempting to cover the fact that a nearly 30-year woman (aging badly) could realistically pass in the role of a young sprightly twenty-year old college sophomore. Ridiculous and narcissism defined.

Once again it comes back to: Just how did these women get their parts? Or should that read: What did she part to get her job?

Have had to deal with this kind of twisted detective work ever since I saw the atrocious miscasting of Ali McGraw in the tv mini-series ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Winds-of-War/dp/B0001NBNGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Winds of War</a>"". She was 45 when filming began. And showcasing stunning ego and hubris, incredulously played herself as a teenager/twenty-something throughout the series! Does anyone really believe this can work? Seriously?

In the history of film, I can think of only two women who were successfully able to mask their age and play roles intended for much younger actresses. Two. Out of what...thousands? To say it's exceedingly rare is an understatement of monumental proportions. So, every once in a while, I'm confronted with yet another production where I wish my monitor would do a selective Photoshop Smart-Blur on the mugs of the women who clearly ""earned"" their roles. Perhaps that should that read ""rolls""?

Whichever.

Sadly, I honestly believe there's a market for homemade adult movies where real-life movie producers video their interviews. Gotta figure there's good side-money to be made to their atrocious film decisions.

Anyway, this disaster/apocalypse flick is based on the infamous super volcano that resides deep within magnificent Yellowstone Park. Scientists have long since proven that the massive caldera collapsed several times in prehistory with horrific planetary results. The question is: What if it happened again today? What made this a cut above the typical cheesy Scifi weekend fluff was the unexpected time travel twist. Nice. Unexpected and appreciated.

Have to admit that part of giving this flick its third star is having a soft spot for rugged actor Richard Burgi. The guy seems to have all the tools to be a star, but I have never figured out why he was never offered the more prestigious roles.

Again, can't help but think how much more enjoyable this flick would've been had the producers been true professionals and cast age appropriate actresses.

Movie Recommendation: To see this same drama played out with infinitely more scary and engaging results - check out: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Supervolcano/dp/B0006GVKC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Supervolcano</a>"". It's actually a docudrama that was done by the BBC and aired on The Discovery Channel. An honestly terrifying film because it's science, not some Hollywood concoction. Even actual geologists have commented on this film noting that it fits within the realm of real science. Check it out if you can.",1355875200,3,3449,5.47457627118644

5109245,3,B007RO8X1U,"""Super Eruption"" is a made for the SyFy Channel product that chronicles the effects of a potential eruption of the massive volcanic caldera that houses Yellowstone National Park. Personally, I love a good disaster flik and am particularly drawn to scenarios that involve volcanic and/or tsunami imagery. ""Super Eruption"" definitely delivered lotsa lava action, but was pretty flawed in many areas of its' basic plot development and editing - thus detracting from its' enjoyment level.

Perhaps one of the most disturbing elements, for me, was the fact that the film was obviously NOT shot in Yellowstone Park - or even America. As is the case with much SyFy Channel product the end credits revealed that the production took place in Eastern Europe and the landscape just didn't look 'right'. I have had the pleasure of visiting Yellowstone and know what it looks like - this factor alone made it hard to get into the feel of the film. The acting was all reasonably well done, but the story line was so 'by the numbers', that it didn't manage to build any kind of suspense or intrigue and, ultimately, relied on some rather improbable plot twists and ridiculously un-realisitic actions that totally destroyed any credibility in the plot. The CGI effects were pretty decent throughout but they felt sorta 'wasted' due to the sloppiness of the screenplay.

A vastly superior take on the same Yellowstone eruption premise was realized by the Discovery Channel/BBC generated docu-drama ""Super Volcano"" which is available on DVD (albeit somewhat scarce), and the Yellowstone sequence in the film ""2012"" also gives much better 'bang for the buck'. Still - ""Super Eruption"" wasn't the worst thing I've seen come out of the SyFy pipeline and it could be recommended for some light weight diversion by fans of the genre.",1432944000,3,1810,5.009966777408638

5109293,4,B007RO8X1U,"This televised movie starts out with a fury of action only be misdirected to two days earlier.  Why so many filmmakers employ this gambit is beyond me.  Nothing irritates me more than to become absorbed in something only to have it abruptly halt so the story can take a step or two behind to the time leading up to the crisis.  And then they repeat the crisis.  The only difference in this case is the involvement of space, time, continuum, something or other, that allows one of the characters to talk to herself long enough to give herself some of the solution to their problem: stopping a volcano eruption like none other (aren't they all), that will shove us into the dark ages.  At any rate, it's a paradox.  Besides the problem of averting disaster, there's also a pseudo relationship between the brainy scientist (Juliet Aubrey) and ranger Charlie (Richard Burgi).  They bicker and snipe at each other, which, as anyone knows, is the perfect formula for romance (a happy marriage would be quite another matter).  Aubrey is a British actress who has appeared in such shows as, Midsomer Murders, Dalziel and Pascoe, Primeval, Vera, and Inspector Lewis.  Why she thought this movie would be a step up for her career is anyone's guess.  Richard Burgi usually takes what he can get.

I have to say that I'm a sucker for films about volcanoes (good or bad).  This one is neither better nor worse than most.  It has the usual implausible plot, the FX is adequate but not altogether convincing, the characters are pretty standard; as entertainment goes, it does the job it's supposed to.  I found that I enjoyed it enough to put it into my collection for future viewings.  It will pair nicely with other disaster flicks of the same type.",1404172800,6,1736,4.683168316831683

I am definitely your typical B movie disaster lover so if you love disaster flicks this one is worth watching.  However, if you are looking for a million dollar blockbuster with top notch scenes, acting, and plots with no gaps in them then this is not your movie.  The beginning really threw me for a curve, which will make sense the more you watch. Although I wish it was a bit longer or more explained about the first part of the movie, it does add an interesting twist to your typical disaster flick.  Acting was ok.

5109297,5,B007RO8X1U,"First off let me say, I love to watch SCY FY disaster films.  It isn't that I am really hard up for stuff to watch, or don't like sophisticated movies.  But like my taste for Slasher movies, it is a fascination I cant explain.  That said, I also like to read about real ways that life as we know it could come to an end.  The premise here, with the caldera at Yellowstone blowing up and causing a sort of nuclear winter is a very real possibility.  After that it does kind of degenerate for the most part into standard disaster film stuff, but it does have its surprises.  I am also a fan of Richard Burgi, so that doesnt hurt.  It isn't exactly Oscar material, but it is a lot of fun to watch, and if you don't know about the Yellowstone Caldera, it will make you want to learn some more.",1392768000,,789,4.117647058823529
5109298,4,B007RO8X1U,"Basing this on a bit of fact...there is an incipient danger of the forces under Yellowstone one day coming to life and destroying everything for hundreds of miles...this film is better than some though it tends to mix genres in a confusing way.  The story opens in the middle of the disaster already happening and then flashes back to two days before and takes it from there.  A female scientist is the lead this time with the male lead a very downplayed second.  There's the usual plot line of rangers going out and herding people to safety, a few casualties, and the solution, presented with the fact that someone has to go on a suicide mission to stop the lava flow.  Nothing new there. What IS different is that the head of the government unit actually works with the scientist and she's also female instead of some belligerent general. Her assistant is the nay-sayer and he gets over-ridden each time...FAST.  In the midst of all this, there's a bit of time travel which jars momentarily on the nerves and may cause the viewer to do a double-take.  There's a long drawn-out segment in which the solution to stopping the disaster is given and that obviously appears to be simply to lengthen the viewing time.  If someone from the future knows what's happening and has the answer, why give part of it, then say, ""I'll tell the next section later?"" Since the heroine is in am observation tower which is in danger of being engulfed by lava, why not give it ALL right then?  Nevertheless, this one is a bit above the other disaster movies because it does buck the cliches a little and because of that I'll give it 4-stars.",1392249600,15,1622,4.568965517241379
