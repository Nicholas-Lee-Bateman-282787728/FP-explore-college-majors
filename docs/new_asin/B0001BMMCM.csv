Yet.it does give some sense of the original magnificense.",1520208000,,113,5.333333333333333

Yelda Kodali. amazing voice, acting and technique. I love it and have played it several times.",1494115200,,160,4.962962962962963
8009710,3,B0001BMMCM,"This film is in essence NOT what it claims to be - it is NOT ""Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail"". While it chewing and dissecting incessantly Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail, it is in reality only fragments of that great opera, chopped to fit the director's taste, who in turn showcases his erudition of the whole opera genre by referring to the ""Cats"". Perhaps before making this film, ""Cats"" was the only opera Elijah knew.

Alas, we simply do not have the whole continuous opera here, which is a real pity, since the original idea of making it ""on location"", in Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, seems very promising. The initial teasers excite the anticipation - the views of Istanbul seashore, its hills, the palace itself - all titillate imagination. Then Belmonte, in a costume of Mozart's time, walks to the palace, singing Die Entfuhrung opening aria ""Hier soll ich dich denn sehen"".

But it is interrupted by director's talking, and then the same pattern continues throughout, yet at the end we do not have the whole ""opera"" - the word opera means ""a work"" - so the actual work was not completed here, unfortunately.

I still give it three stars because I loved the scenery, and from that point on whenever I see Die Entfuhrung the images from this incomplete production conjure up in mind. The same was in Berlin on June 13 this year, where this opera was staged. The singing was excellent, I posted some videos on youtube:

[...]

Here on this DVD, however, the singing is superb, too - I loved Yelda Kodalli as Konstanze, and Desire Bancatore as Blonde. I'd say that if this production was complete, it would end up better than a classic Die Entfuhrung with Edita Gruberova and Karl Bohm, easily available on DVD here and everywhere. I find Kodalli Konstanze a very inspiring image, young, vulnerable and arrogant, quite different from Gruberova's interpretation.

Another pleasant character here in Peter Bone as Osmin; his voice is somewhat higher than a normal Osmin, and it sounded refreshing. The famous scene of Blonde teaching Osmin art of love in ""Durch Zrtlichkeit und Schmeicheln"" aria is so marvelously staged here - so naturally and funny, with Desire Bancatore putting up a splendid performance.

All in all, I recommend this video due to great singing and scenery, while keeping in mind that the magic of continuous music will be interrupted here - perhaps the director thought that there were too many notes in the whole opera.",1312416000,8,2441,4.81145584725537
8009711,5,B0001BMMCM,"If you wish you liked this  Mozart opera better, or if you always loved this opera and appreciate new insights , this is a dvd to watch.  The  voices are splendid .  (Paul Groves, a marvelous tenor from Louisiana proves that  Opera  is  still a part of that states great musical heritage).
Colorful perfection in the costumes and sets creates  absolutely stunning visuals.",1266192000,,372,4.7936507936507935
8009712,5,B0001BMMCM,"This brilliantly-conceived presentation is so interesting, and so much fun, that I hated for it to end.  I AM sorry that there is not a full complete opera-only version of this production as I am sure it would also be a treasure.  Since watching this, I've been disappointed by two other DVDs of this same opera: they seem a little flat and empty by comparison.  My thanks to all concerned.",1232755200,2,390,4.542857142857143
8009713,5,B0001BMMCM,"Every year the Istanbul Music Festival ends with a performance of Il Seraglio, staged in the forecourt of the old Topkapi Palace - supposedly the very palace from where Mozart's lovers made their escape.
In 2006, my wife and I were lucky enough to see a performance there (not this one), and this DVD is a perfect way to recall the wonderful atmosphere of the occasion.
This sumptous film version has nothing to do with the annual Turkish stage production and is not staged in just the one static location.  Instead, it is shot in various glorious rooms and courtyards around the old Harem and Palace; doing full visual justice to one of Mozart's most beloved operas.
The singers are all first rate, especially Peter Rose as the villainous Osmin. His menace and bumbling ineptitude are hilariously portrayed, and rousingly sung.
Yelda Kodalli is a gorgeous Konstanze, if one can dismiss the rather anachronistic notion of a Turkish opera singer playing a Spanish lady trying to escape from Turkey!
As another reviewer has noted, this is really a condensed version of the opera, but the story is intact, all the favourite arias are included, and the behind the scenes story of the staging and filming is fascinating in itself.
One nice feature is that the viewer is given the choice to skip these contemporary inserts and view the musical sequences uninterrupted.
Stunning - an unmitigated treat for both the eyes and the ears!",1186617600,15,1426,4.868312757201646
8009714,5,B0001BMMCM,"First, I should mention that this is not the complete opera, ""The Abduction from the Seraglio.""  The program notes call it ""one-third documentary and two-thirds filmed opera.""

Even that just begins to describe this performance.
It is performed in a palace in Istanbul, where the beauty and color of the location and the costumes are stunningly bright and authentically Turkish.

The Scottish Chamber Orchestra, led by Charles Mackerras, and the singers, especially Paul Groves (Belmonte) and Desiree Rancatore (Blonde) do full justice to Mozart's most popular work during his lifetime.

You'll find all of the most popular scenes of ""The Abduction,"" sung wonderfully and with the most crystal-clear photography you can imagine.

An extra treat is commentary, which helps explain Mozart and his music, AND a seat for you at the dinner table as you watch the singers eat, relax, and playfully sing bits of their favorite songs.

Though not the full opera, this is a delightful and beauty-filled presentation.  (It would be a great way to introduce newcomers to the world of opera, or to show those familiar with the work a colorful new perspective.)",1116028800,25,1148,5.139784946236559
