4834995,1,B005MQ58RC,"dont know why but her material has gotten progressively worse over time.  this was downright painful to listen to.  I was embarrassed for her.  If you make the mistake of buying this, you will hate this garbage.  Not only did i order the dvd but i downloaded it from itunes as well.  The copy on itunes will be deleted and the dvd will be re-gifted.  Thank God I didn't take the plastic off.",1337040000,4,391,4.287671232876712

4834997,1,B005MQ58RC,"I wanted to like Cho Dependent and even set aside a Saturday night - something I don't do that often - just to drink some wine and laugh with Margaret.  She was over-the-top and seemed almost angry, at times.  I have been a huge fan for at least 10 years, if not more, and have always laughed with her, marveled by her talent.  Yes, she sings in Cho Dependent, but the songs were too long.  Also, as much as an advocate for the gay life as anyone, I didn't need to hear about the anal-ness.  I have always celebrated her as a woman but I think she may be upset with her own life, somehow, to promote so much gay as opposed to any other orientation.  There were a few moments that made me chuckle, but perhaps she's done. I think she's brilliant, but unhappy, and that's my two cents.  Huge Disappointment!!! IF I could have given it half a star, I would have.",1326067200,6,859,4.201219512195122
4834998,5,B005MQ58RC,One of my Favorite comedians. Her humor and comedy are far too close an sometimes true of those I know and things I have seen or experienced in everyday life..,1427241600,,159,4.333333333333333

4835000,5,B005MQ58RC,One of her best yet! Plus i love that she sings some of the songs from her album as well. I've love watching her evolve through her career abd this proves she's 1 of the greatest comedians and inspirationalists!,1394668800,,211,4.435897435897436
4835001,5,B005MQ58RC,"Margaret Cho's stand-up films have always been hilarious, but her previous film, 'Beautiful,' didn't quite hit the mark.  'Cho Dependent' once again finds Margaret in top form with perfect delivery.  I highly recommend this one!",1389312000,,228,5.485714285714286

4835003,1,B005MQ58RC,"Like watching a drag show. Used to love Cho but this was very disappointing for me. Old Cho was much better and appealed to a larger audience. Probably still good for her gay dude and loose women audience I guess,not that there's anything wrong with that!",1372723200,,255,4.565217391304348
4835004,4,B005MQ58RC,"Margaret Cho is never a disappointment. Though some performances are better than others, including Cho Dependent, she never fails to deliver laughs.

4835005,3,B005MQ58RC,"Margaret Cho has gotten away from stories about her mom and observations about the world that made me fall in love with her . This one starts off great, but then ends up with crude and not funny descriptions of sexual things.",1365379200,6,225,4.380952380952381
4835006,5,B005MQ58RC,"I thoroughly enjoyed this latest release from Margaret Cho.  The material was fresh, new and entertaining, mixed with laughs and song.  I have been a Margaret Cho fan since her sitcom series on TV, and have seen her live and own her previous DVD releases.....I can say that she never disappoints, especially if you have been a fan.  I highly recommend this latest release,",1355616000,2,372,4.78125
