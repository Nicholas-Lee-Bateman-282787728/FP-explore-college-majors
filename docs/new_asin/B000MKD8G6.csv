Their appearance is both intimidating and beautiful.  ""Castles and Dungeons"" provides an overview of English and Spanish castles.

The first castles dated back to the 10th century, and probably were in France.  Constant raids by Vikings, Arabs, and occasional neighbors, combined with a weak central government created a need for these structures.

First designs were simple Motte (hill) and Bailey (central courtyard) structures.  Walls were plastered over wood (appear as stone), and a defensive ditch was dug in front.  Timber fortifications, however, were replaced by stone as fire became a weapon.

A fair-sized castle required 3,500 workers 4.5 years to construct.  Walls incorporated scaffolding support holes, and were 7-9 feet thick, filled with rubble.  Cranes and winches, along with plumb bobs and lime mortar were used in the construction.  Walls (inside and out) were plastered to help protect the mortar, and gave a bright white appearance to the castles.  Glass was used in the windows, except in lavatory rooms, which emptied over a river (hopefully).

Builders first looked for sites with good natural defenses - eg. cliffs, along with a good water supply.  Moats, up to 30' wide may have been filled with water.  Towers projected out from the walls to offer protection to adjacent tower.  Thin vertical slits afforded archers a protected location to fire their arrows.  Walls at the bottom were as much as 20' wide, tapering outward - thus, rocks dropped from above would shatter on those below.

The castle gate was 5"" thick wood; once attackers entered, however, they were vulnerable to continued assault from inward-facing vertical slits and those stationed upon the walls.

Eventually offenses learned to build tunnels under a castle corner, propping up the excavation with beams and branches.  After being set afire, the wall was vulnerable to falling down.

Castles also served as a jail, courthouse, and in a few instances, torture chamber.  When the king was present meals would last 3+ hours.

Canons, and improved centralized government led to the decline of castle-building.

Finally, viewers also learn that Spanish castles were more of an art form, especially those built in later years.  Their insides were elaborately adorned.  Their primary role was as part of the reconquest on Spain from the Moors.",1225324800,,2483,5.222784810126583
