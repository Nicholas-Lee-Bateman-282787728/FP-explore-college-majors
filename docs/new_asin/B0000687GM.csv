7963796,1,B0000687GM,"What a piece of trash this one is. Stereotypes abound, from gays to  hot black chicks with the only thing on their mind--sex (the same for the black men), and the inevitable fat black chick who's favorite pastime is fried chicken. At the beginning there's a funeral and no explanation at the end, so the only thing to conclude is the film died.",1111449600,,344,4.4603174603174605
7963797,2,B0000687GM,Two stars is generous but I have to be a little biased having  a couple of relatives in this film (one with a major role).  The movie direction is straight from the Spike Lee school of filmaking. The story line is cliche but easy to follow and I can appreciate what the writer/director was trying to do.  This is a low budget film so I can't blame them for the acting and poor production quailty.,1102464000,2,396,4.253333333333333
7963798,4,B0000687GM,"Despite its oddball beginning, I found Hairdo U, to be an amusing tale of love, deception, and wacky hijinks at a Missouri beauty academy.
David and Wayne are two homophobic construction workers. After a misunderstanding which quickly gets out of hand and escalates to violence, an unsympathetic judges sentences them to.. Beauty School. Yes, that's right folks... Forget the Hospital, the Highway trash pick up... Our heroes get hard time at a beauty academy.
At the school David falls for one of the managers, a woman named Aqua. Determined to win her, David pretends to be gay in order to become her friend. (Groan). During the process, David, does not grow or change (rather unsatisfying character development in my opinion), but Aqua doesn't seem to care! She loves him anyway! (Please.. Girl... This is the 21rst century!).
I really found this movie to be light-hearted and amusing, despite the fact that lying, cheating and intolerant behavior appear to be rewarded, and our hero David, never apologizes or shows much remorse to Tiny for throwing him through the window, nor does he really grow much as a person. (Sigh). Still, there were some good lines, which make this one worth checking out.",1038268800,4,1202,4.985074626865671
