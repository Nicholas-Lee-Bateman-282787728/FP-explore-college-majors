7837562,5,6303094899,"For those Doctor Who fans who do not know that there was a show before 2005, this is a good example of how the Doctor looked in the 1960's when treated to British movies. Sure, it is inaccurate in the design of the TARDIS and he was NEVER known as ""DOCTOR WHO"" but ""THE DOCTOR"". Still, it is fun and well worth adding to your collection.",1393459200,,337,4.121212121212121
7837563,4,6303094899,"The second and last of the Aaru Doctor Who films, Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 AD, is basically the film version of the second Dalek story, The Dalek Invasion Of Earth, and outdoes the previous Aaru film. Instead of Ian and Barbara, we have Louise, the Doctor's niece, and Tom Campbell, a constable who after being coshed on the head by some robbers, stumbles into the TARDIS just as its course has been set.
The point in making a film rendition of a TV series is to improve on the original, right? Well, this film does do that in many areas, which is what bigger budgets are for. The scene of London in ruins is realized more effectively. Considering how the original serial for this was 150 minutes long, condensing it to 80 minutes and still getting the cream of the plot is quite a feat.
The brass march of the Robomen is snazzy and snappy. The Robomen themselves are dressed in glossy black fetish suits with whips and have goggles over their eyes. I know this wasn't a BBC production, but I'm surprised why they didn't consider that kinky and they backtracked on having a villainess in jackboots too risque in Colony In Space.
The most notable improvement are the Dalek flying saucers, whose two windowed section rotate in opposite directions. They are the most effective in aerial shots, but are done right to scale in ground shots, as when the prisoners are escorted to the landing strip where it is parked.
There is a funny scene involving Tom, disguised as a Roboman. He has trouble marching in sync with the other Robomen, and this includes eating, as they all eat in unison.
The claw-arm Daleks outnumber the standard sink-plunger arm Daleks, and these Daleks have a sharp paint job, enhanced by the fact that they are in colour.
Peter Cushing makes a good Doctor, the gentle archetypal absent-minded professor. Roberta Tovey reappears as Susan. Other notables include Bernard Cribbins as Tom Campbell, Ray Brook as David, who made his mark in Pete Walker films (House Of Whipcord, The Flesh And Blood Show, The Tale Of Tiffany Jones), and Phil Madoc as Brockley the black marketeer. Madoc appeared in a number of stories: The Krotons, The Brain Of Morbius, and The Power Of Kroll. And Jill Curzon shines the screen as the lovely Louise.
In the end, nothing compares to the original series, but this spin-off does have a charm of its own.",1009411200,15,2348,4.687651331719128
7837564,3,6303094899,Interesting to have a full motion picture of the classic Who serial.  Good  special effects and pace.  Don't know where to fit this story in with the  rest of Doctor Who continuity but it is pleasant nevertheless.  Peter  Cushing does a great job as the Doctor and the Daleks are superb!
