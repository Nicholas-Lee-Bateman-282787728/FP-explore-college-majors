8389097,5,B0035KTIYQ,"More slapstick, with some genuine sweetness and heartfelt emotion mixed in.
High school art student Jin carves a statue from the wood of a sacred tree.
Jin just wants to enter his art in an upcoming contest.
This proves difficult when the statue bursts into life in the form of the goddess Nagi,
who makes Jin her acolyte, moves into his house, starts attending his school
and generally plunges his life into anime harem havoc.
Pretty hilariously.
The only disappointment I felt with this series is that there isn't more of it.",1388275200,,527,4.739130434782608
8389098,5,B0035KTIYQ,This is another anime at the top of my list.  It has a great story and is very funny .  It's a 5 star and highly recommended.,1375833600,,125,3.5925925925925926
8389099,1,B0035KTIYQ,"From the creators of Lucky Star and Hayate the Combat Butler comes a fun little tale between a young boy and his Art Project that comes alive and then boasts about being a Japanese goddess.

There are a number of colorful characters throughout the show, and is humorous.

However, Bandai is pretty much dead, and needs to be put out the rest of the way.  (and by that I mean literally sell all its titles to FUNimation where they might actually get some deserved treatment.  (Dubbing/better packaging).",1347667200,3,502,4.735632183908046
8389100,1,B0035KTIYQ,"Kannagi is one of my favorite series, but when they charge 50$ for a DVD box set to a ""13 episode"" series, and it isn't even dubbed, I call it criminal.

Common Practice with Bandai, and Sentai Filmworks. They won't put series in 5.1, but instead 2.0. Over half the time they don't even dub. To top it all off, not only are their products not in 5.1 or dubbed, but they also charge PREMIUM prices for their Discs as well. 50-60$ it just unacceptable anymore for a DVD/Blu-Ray still in production.

Basically they get a license, then they ship off the dvds.

Sry for ranting, kannagi is a great anime series. It is cliche, but the way the series is presented compared to most animes of its genre is excellent.

I do not recommend buying it, until they at least dub it. Hell I'd only buy it if they at least dropped the price to 20$ and dubbed it.",1312243200,5,845,4.2625
8389101,5,B0035KTIYQ,"Well there is a great story here in Kannagi. I found the characters and the animation design by A-1 Pictures to be very good.
There are harem aspects in the show, but it's much more than that. It's about two young people, Jin and Kannagi, that come together under unusual circumstances. They learn to live with each others inconsistencies while trying to figure out just who the hell they are in the world.
That statement is especially true for Kannagi or Nagi as she is called by Jin, and her friends. All the side or minor characters are good ,too.
As you watch them spend time together, you do find yourself wanting to know more about them.

It's just a damn enjoyable anime, and hilarious at times. It definately takes you on an emotional ride. Of course there may be a few things left to the unknown, but the overall charming story it does tell really does cover that up.
It comes with Volumes 1 and 2, one disc per volume, in an open ended case that holds both.
I highly recommend it.",1298851200,3,990,4.409836065573771
8389102,5,B0035KTIYQ,"comes in two dvd, dvd box feels like the knockoff dvd boxes you get off the streets. the dvd only come with the dvd no insert, i used to watch this show on youtube but man i tell you the audio is great, video is also good but id rather have it on bluray, its so funny and awkward, you'll definitely  have moments when you feel your face is red from all the silliness, anyways dvd is great comes with some extras,i bought it cus i thought it would help get season two in action, i really hope they produce season two, sigh.",1284076800,,522,4.067961165048544
8389103,4,B0035KTIYQ,"This anime does not has only English subtitles, so if that turns you
off, don't buy this title. That said, the story takes several shows
to introduce that characters, and then you have a very good character
study.

This is from the director of Lucky Star. This is more plot based, but
has some of the character depth that Lucky star has.

Jen, a first year student at the High School, wants to carve a statue
for the Arts Festival at school. He is given a piece of wood from a
sacred tree, and carves a shrine maiden he met years before. When the
statue is placed outside on the ground, the stature absorbs earth and
transforms into the maiden he remembers, only she is the goddess of the
sacred tree.

With her tree gone, Nagi has to adjust to being human in modern Japan.

The best part of this story come when all the characters are defined,
and episodes can work on human interaction. Characters are well defined,
and this series could use a second season. The first season ends with
several things still up in the air.

Artwork is very clean, and characters are well drawn. It is worth
adding to a collection.",1280620800,,1114,4.414634146341464
8389104,5,B0035KTIYQ,"I feel like I have to give this a positive review to tell people this is a good product the show is a slice of life series about a boy called Jin Mikuriya who after carving a piece of some ancient sacred tree the part of tree that he cut comes to life as a young girl called Nagi who is a goddess it's kind of like Haruhi with more slice of life stuff and a bit less super natural elements with the art being somewhat similar to that of K-on!

The show is very good you can kind of feel a nice connection between the protagonist and Nagi (who's quite quirky which I liked)
Don't want to say a lot more as not to spoil it 8)

In fact after checking up the show was directed by the same guy as Haruhi which explains the similarity",1273881600,7,728,3.945578231292517
