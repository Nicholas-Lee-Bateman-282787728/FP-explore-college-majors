7975506,5,B00007ELFZ,Love it!,1436227200,,8,3.5
7975507,2,B00007ELFZ,It's great to see the pioneering women of surfing but this movie is dated and comes off like a hippie drippy home movie-- undermining the incredible expertise and fun these women had surfing. Thanks goodness there's a lot of surfing footage to watch!,1403308800,,250,4.837209302325581
7975508,5,B00007ELFZ,"Would you guys get a grip and READ what this movie is???  It is NOT the ""Blue Crush"" movie with Kate Bosworth!! Look at what you're ordering! Before you start blabbing about things and looking stupid!
THIS movie (by the same name) is a DOCUMENTARY!!!!!!! BTW...BOTH are very good. But remember...it's better to keep your mouth shut and look like a fool, than speak and prove it.",1311292800,2,378,4.641791044776119
7975509,5,B00007ELFZ,"Okay, the other reviews in this section make me extremely angry. It appears that no one has actually seen this film but me. I mean this literally. All the reviews here are for the 2002 Hollywood movie ""Blue Crush"", which was a FICTIONAL movie staring Kate Bosworth. The actual movie that is for sale here is the ORIGINAL Blue Crush, with pro surfers Megan Abubo and Rochelle Ballard. Kate Bosworth is NOT in this movie, contrary to the product description. THIS MOVIE, is a documentary about a group of professional female surfers, and takes place in the South Pacific (NOT HAWAII). It was a fantastic surf documentary, and a glimpse into the lives of these REAL professional surfers. So please, for the sake of surfers everywhere, DO NOT CONFUSE THIS MOVIE WITH THE HOLLYWOOD COPY OF THE SAME NAME!!!!!",1296518400,9,803,4.784172661870503
7975510,4,B00007ELFZ,"The documentary covered most of the top female surfers out there and some of the surfing spots around the world.  There was a lot of good footage.  Only thing I didn't like was the constant, blink-of-an-eye scene-switching during the action shots.  It hurt my eyes...felt like I was going through some weird shock therapy at a mental institute :oP.  Also, the interviews were a bit low and the background music for the action shots were high.  So, I had to constantly adjust the volume.",1163030400,5,486,4.738095238095238
7975511,5,B00007ELFZ,"The funny parts in this movie is

the outtakes in the end credits

where it is people can you actually

surf or is it clowing also in the

""Serena & Somoa"" segment where

Keala Kennelly does the ""I'm with

the dj"" number also the take 2

section where they can't get not a

thing right especialy Rochelle Ballard

who tries to say push at one point push

but it turns in to eight letters instead

that can't be said on radio or tv without

problems.",1113436800,,449,4.152941176470589
