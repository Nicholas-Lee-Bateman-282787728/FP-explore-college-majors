8608724,5,B00ERH16VY,"The marvelous absurdity of Stabbing includes snippets of reality that make no more sense than do sock thieves or serial killers.

Example:  Herman gets into trouble for not wearing a tie to a menial job.  THIS HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE.

But you place these little details in the context of the warped universe of this movie, and it's hysterically funny.

It's paced well, the dialogue is funny, the acting ranges from very good to enjoyably green, the story's a riot.

For a film with no budget, I've watched it from time to time for a decade.  And it's been a funnier decade because of it.",1390089600,2,586,4.523809523809524
