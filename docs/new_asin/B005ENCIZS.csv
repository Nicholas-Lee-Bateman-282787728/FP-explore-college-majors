8468776,3,B005ENCIZS,"""Howdy Broadway"" is an interesting early poverty row musical. Primitive filming and amateur acting make it a fun view. The print on the DVD runs 47 minutes
and seems to be complete. Some sources indicate the original release was 70 minutes, but nothing appears to be missing.

The two shorts are enjoyable. A young Betty Grable sparks one, while Milton Berle chews the scenery in the other.

All in all, a good package for the price. Prints are a little worn, but overall sound and picture quality is acceptable.",1315699200,5,512,4.741573033707865
