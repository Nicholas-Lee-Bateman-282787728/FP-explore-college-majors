4109861,4,B003CPPY6A,"I was prepared not to like WILD THINGS 4: FOURSOME. I usually don't like direct-to-video sequels that piggyback onto more successful films by association, but I was pleasantly distracted by WILD THINGS: FOURSOME

A cast of virtually unknown pretty boys and pretty girls make up the cast. The acting is good, which is to say that the screenwriters were smart enough not to strain the actors' abilities with anything too demanding. The storyline follows the overall concept of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Things/dp/B0001GF2D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Things</a>. It's a kill-or-be-klled fest of backstabbings, betrayals, rip-offs, lies, and misdirection.

WILD THINGS: FOURSOME was made in sunny South Florida. In what amounts to a continuity problem, it takes place either in the fictional city of ""Blue Bay"" or in Miami. Never mind the contrivance, it's upscale Miami, impure and unsimple.

Surprisingly enough, the plot holds up really well through its numerous twists and turns. Carson Wheetley, rich and young and handsome, scion of NASCAR hero Ted Wheetley, hates his father who may have killed his mother. Carson has a hot girlfriend. Actually, he has three hot girlfriends, and they hatch a plot to kill Daddy Wheetley and divvy up his money. Shortly thereafter, Daddy Wheetley dies during a race, and the cops get involved. Daddy Wheetley's lawyer suddenly announces that Carson can't inherit until he marries. He marries one hot girlfriend, Rachel, and inherits. Carson and Rachel decide to kill the other girls and keep all the money. Rachel and the other girls decide to kill Carson so Rachel the grieving widow can inherit. The other girls decide to kill Carson and then kill Rachel. And so on. Nobody has clean hands in WILD THINGS: FOURSOME.

Full of bikini babes, cigarette boats, makeout scenes, cocaine, sapphic erotica, fast cars, tanning oil, bare breasts, and views from the private islands in Biscayne Bay, WILD THINGS: FOURSOME is not exactly memorable, but it's worth an enjoyable 90 minutes of your time under the mango tree.",1282608000,37,2120,5.454268292682927
4109862,5,B003CPPY6A,"Great products, however I wish they had been delivered via U.S. Postal service like they usually are instead of U.P.S. It would have been much easier to recieve them that way. Other than that I am very satisfied. Thanks",1281139200,2,219,4.641025641025641
4109863,1,B003CPPY6A,"The series of Wild Things movies wants desperately to be a part of neo-noir cinema, yet the characters are so cartoony, the audience doesn't really care what happens to them.  The plot holes are so large that the director decided that the end credits should double as five minutes of filling in the narrative gaps.  The movie is of course about greed, and there's a large amount of money at stake.  It's not particularly clear how the people who end up with the money could actually access it legally.  It's not worth thinking about though.",1278201600,12,540,4.652631578947369

The plot twists without clues and does so simply for the sake of twisting...Oh look at us, we are clever script writers. Except for the eye candy scene, the film was boring, as if it came from a TV script.

4109905,2,B003CPPY6A,"I would love nothing more than to write that ""Wild Things: Foursome (Unrated Edition)"" was a keeper.  It would be untrue.  There is very little about this A + B + C = profit formula film which makes it redeemable.  Some of the swim wear was trendy for the time.

4109909,3,B003CPPY6A,Ok I like the other 3 Wild Thing movies. The girls are nice and the movies have nice twists. But this one at best was a foul tip. I am a fan of Marnette Patterson but the movie was really lacking in the story.,1381536000,,209,3.772727272727273

By now you know the story well enough that you don't need me to rehash it.  My advice is just skip it and watch the original again because you're not missing anything. In fact, just pretend that Wild Things 2,3, and now 4 don't even exist. Hell, the only ""series"", and I use the term lightly, worse than this is Bring It On.",1332460800,,446,4.309523809523809

4109930,3,B003CPPY6A,"This little film can be filed away into my: I.N.S.B Folder. ""Really It's Not So Bad!"" Certainly not great..Perhaps just ""barely"" worth your time. However if your in the mood for some hot Florida sun, filled with good looking guys and several hot bikini un-clad young women involved in the fast lanes of sex, drugs, and larceny, not to mention multiple murders, then file this one away for a rainy day. The twists and turns abound and really in addition to the nudity are enough to hold your attention. Hang on through the credits..your not done until the last line rolls by. Why not?
