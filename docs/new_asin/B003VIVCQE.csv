4209281,4,B003VIVCQE,"Im writing this review more to address Mr Matthew Lane's review which totally trashes this movie. It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it's a whole lot better than he makes it out to be, and since, at this time, he's the only other review, I thought it necessary to speak to the movie's strengths, which are many.  Once you strip away the seeming silliness of the whole LARP phenomenon, this movie is really about the human mind. You've got a lot of people here who delude themselves (as we all do). It's a little exaggerated here, but it's credible. The story is pretty basic, but throughout we are given quite perceptive examples of real humans with real flaws despite the whole framework of make-belief that surrounds everything. I was surprised by the movie. You have to dig beyond the surface to get to what's really there, though. I recommend it.",1300579200,2,860,4.620915032679738
4209282,1,B003VIVCQE,"Okay, i'll keep this review as short as possible, because the less said about this movie the better. This movie got a lot of rewards on the indi track, but that doesn't make it a good movie (it just makes it less bad then the other indi films out there for the year).

This movie is the blair witch 2, minus the plot, the interesting characterization, the suspense, the dialogue or the ambience.

This movie follows the bumbelling love life of a pair of Generation-Y no hopers, one a young woman obsessed with a LARP (Live Action Role Playing Game for those of you who have never heard of it before... Think of it as a less juvenile version of what we saw in role models) & a guy who doesn't want anything to do with it. In the classic ""adding artificial conflict"" means, he goes to see her at her LARP event & its all down hill from there.

Apparently the love interest is a shallow princess whose only marketable skill is whoring her self out to (artificially) powerful men & when her boyfriend (who is likewise unlikable) shows up he tries to convince her to leave with him. Then some totally unrealistic, story breaking over acting happens & a group of people way to invested in the game apparently go mad & start killing (pillaging, raping, mutilating & burning for good measure) each other for no other reason then ""somebody breaking the rules of the LARP."" At no point is there anything stopping everyone jumping into there cars and saying ""Screw this noise, i'm out of here.""

Other then the plot having more holes in it then the aforementioned Blair Witch 2 project, the director has a tendency to try and use negative audio space to give us a feeling of depth & absence of joy (or more aptly ""lonelyness""), but fails to couple it with any dynamic visuals, or any emotional writing before or after, making the entire endevaour fall flat. Beyond that the characterization ranged from so stupid as to be insulting, to so anti-social i'm suprised the characters hadn't fallito'd a shot gun yet. The problem with the characterization was that unless you care for the character in some way, you can't care enough to care if he gets killed & the two main characters are nothing if not universally unlikable.

Overall i found it mildly disturbing, not due to the content, but because of how many people were hyping this movie. This movie is not good as a horror movie, as a suspense movie, as a survival horror film, a fantasy film or any other sort of film... This film is an indi film in the very worst way: Instead of trying to tell a story, it tries to be deep by making everyone in the film absolutely miserable & act all sullen.

My suggestion, if you've got your heart set on watching a geeky movie set in 2010, watching Scott Pilgrim versus the World instead... Sure there's not a whole heap to it, but it contained considerably more depth then the Wild Hunt.",1289433600,3,2869,4.507692307692308
4209283,4,B003VIVCQE,"Erik Magnusson is living a hopeless life. He is barely out of his teens but the pressures of earning enough money to survive, and caring for his senile ailing father, have exhausted him. Erik's resentment and despair are understandable: his older brother Bjorn disappears for months on end, leaving an overwhelmed Erik to manage alone. Even Erik's girlfriend Lyn deserts him, ostensibly to look for a job, but really to spend the weekend acting as a Viking princess at Bjorn's role-playing game in the woods.

Erik is portrayed by Ricky Mabe, who's better known for his comedy work in films such as ""The Trotsky"", ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", ""Goon"", and ABC Family's made-in-Toronto TV series ""Beautiful People"". There's very little comedy in ""The Wild Hunt""; however, Mabe puts in a strong performance in one of his first dramatic lead roles, which got some excellent reviews. Tiio Horn plays Lyn, Erik's moody dissatisfied love interest. She is in a love triangle with the older Celtic shaman Murtagh (Trevor Hayes). Not much is revealed about Murtagh's background, but he seems to have problems of his own, dealing with increasingly-violent and obsessive members of his group like the cruel Greg-ash (Kent McQuaid). Comic relief in this rather grim situation is provided by the outlandish antics of Erik's older brother Bjorn (Mark A. Krupa), the cynical King Argyle (Nicolas Wright), the timid would-be warrior David (Kyle Gatehouse), and Bjorn's nerdy accountant friend Bernie (Terry Simpson). Egged on by Bjorn and some of the other participants, Erik decides to enter the game's fantasy world and win back his girlfriend's affection. The players start choosing sides in the dispute, as do a couple of the referees (Claudia Jurt and Spiro Malandrakis) -- this makes the situation increasingly unstable, as people begin to break the rules to help Erik. As the game spins into chaos, the ominous ending hinted at early in the film is fully revealed, but with a twist.

As Bjorn, carried away with the excitement of his younger brother's ""love quest"", makes them swear an oath on his representation of Thor's magical hammer, the reluctant Erik protests ""we were born in Canada!"" And so they were ... but the forest that engulfs them is not the pure unspoiled refuge of North American visionaries like Thoreau and Muir, but Europe's darker path of blood and madness alluded to by Simon Schama (""Landscape and Memory"").

The film's cinematography is exceptional, for a relatively small-budget Canadian indie production. There's a stark contrast between mundane inner-city Montreal and the freedom and beauty of the woodland gaming site. To get there, Erik has to depart on a literal geographic as well as emotional quest. Mark A. Krupa is best known in Canada as a wilderness writer and TV host, so the undercurrent of enchantment and escapism in the outdoors scenes is probably not surprising - he also co-wrote the screenplay. The use of the Duchy of Bicolline near Shawinigan Quebec, an existing live-action roleplaying (LARP) compound -- and recruiting extras who are involved in the hobby -- conveys a colourful anachronistic atmosphere. Representing the perspective of most viewers, Erik is bewildered by the strange people he sees when he enters the compound to look for Lyn -- and frustrated by the elaborate system of rules that the referees insist he follow, such as wearing a period costume to comply with ""decorum"".

This film is not intended to be an accurate depiction of LARP, the Society for Creative Anachronism, or historical re-enactment in Canada or anywhere else. Judging by online discussions, some players are concerned that audiences may get a negative impression of what they do. All I can say is, the LARP and re-enactment people I know who've seen this film generally enjoyed it, without taking it too seriously. Commented one online reviewer, ""it's not like anyone will actually be afraid of this happening for real; they're Canadians for God's sake"".

More serious are some of the issues with first-time director Alexandre Franchi's script, which he co-wrote with Krupa. The story probably could have benefited from more editing, since it seems repetitive and slow-moving in the second half. Horn does her best, but Lyn's character is unevenly written -- she frequently seems so fickle that it strains credibility, something that might have been remedied if she'd had more lines or actions that could offer an insight into what she's thinking. Instead a lot of the burden for justifying their relationship is placed on Erik, as he shows his desperation to sustain even the illusion of romance in his drab life. Some key points in the story take place at night, but this can be confusing to follow as many scenes are dark and murky. (I'm cutting them some slack on this though, since some of the footage may have been shot by a skeleton crew of only four, including the director, at the site's scheduled Big Battle Weekend a month before the main shoot.) As for the DVD release, the extra features are a bit disappointing. Even a commentary track, by the writer/director or a few of the actors or production staff, would have been a welcome addition. In post-release interviews, Krupa hinted that the earlier love story showing the extent of Erik and Lyn's relationship had been cut -- it may have been helpful to the audience to see what brought them together in the first place, and what he meant by the ""serious problems"" in Lyn's background.

The Wild Hunt won Best First Canadian Feature Film at The Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.",1357171200,,5580,5.001076426264801
4209284,4,B003VIVCQE,"Erik chases after his girlfriend who has left him to live in a fantasy Live Action Role Play community. A stranger in a very strange land, Erik stumbles and has to partner with his estranged brother Bjorn, who has no life outside the game, and various players and referees (including a ""Mexican Viking""). Yes, it's a quest. Along the way, Erik learns the ways of this new realm, rescues the girl, and reconciles with both his brother and his girlfriend. The game brought them together, but some people are sore losers.

In some ways, The Wild Hunt resembles The Wicker Man (the original, mind you): the main character slowly descends from the modern, rationalist world into the pre-modern, mythic world.

This is a low budget production, reportedly half a million dollars, and sometimes it shows, but that actually fits the story and the premise. Human imagination is so powerful that costumes cobbled together from thrift stores and foam-and-duct-tape swords can be create an entirely alternate reality, one where we can believe in heroes and villains and true love.

Just as The Lord of the Rings ends with the departure of the elves from Middle Earth, the loss of their grace, this story ends with the breaking of the law that made this strange and beautiful place possible. It is quite literally the end of _a_ world, and pack an unexpected punch.",1349308800,4,1351,4.83982683982684
4209285,5,B003VIVCQE,"I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A HISTORICAL MEDIEVAL MOVIE WHEN I CAME ACROSS THIS LITTLE GEM.  I'M A DIE-HARD MEDIEVALIST AND HORROR FAN, SO I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE TRAILER AND DECIDED TO WATCH, THINKING TO MYSELF I'D PROBABLY NEVER FINISH IT.  BOY,WAS I EVER WRONG!  FOR HAVING BEEN MADE ON A LIMITED BUDGET, THIS MOVIE IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL.  IT IS BOTH TOTALLY BELIEVABLE AND FUNNY AS HELL IN PLACES, AS IT SLOWLY BUILDS TO IT'S SAD AND HORRIBLE CLIMAX. IF YOU WANT SLICK DIALOGUE AND SPECIAL EFFECTS, THEN THIS IS NOT YOUR MOVIE. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A GOOD FILM ABOUT REAL PEOPLE SHOWING US JUST HOW BADLY JEALOUSY CAN MAKE US BEHAVE AND WHAT THE ""PACK INSTINCT"" CAN DO WHEN IT RUNS AWRY, THEN WATCH THIS MOVIE. PLUS, IT HAD SOME OF THE MOST REALISTIC LOOKING INJURIES I'VE EVER SEEN ON FILM.

4209286,1,B003VIVCQE,"A very confused movie.  It meanders through its first eighty-minute Act and then gets nonsensical and just winds down in its last ten minutes.  Is the coda supposed to be a searing indictment of live-action roleplaying?  Is such an indictment really necessary?

Tonally, the movie is profoundly confused and doesn't know what it wants to be. Story-wise it's illogical and really asks the viewer to abandon any real investment in the very world its trying to create.  Aesthetically it's blue-on-blue-on-black flat.  There's a single character of interest but the movie fails to successfully explore him (and the moviemakers ignore a great conflict between estranged brothers that could've been the lynchpin of a spectacular action/comedy).  Ultimately there aren't any valuable characters; I don't know who these people are, what they're really fighting for or why I should care.

An impressive effort for a budget of $500k, is what we're all supposed to say about this movie, but it fails in nearly every department.  It generally lacks heart, eschews tremendous opportunities for story, characters, humor and excitement throughout its incredibly-long first act, degenerates into nonsensical gore in the last few minutes and then just sort drops off the face of the earth.

A great concept given an abysmal treatment.

I did, however, make a spectacular stew while I was watching it.  So, there's that.",1327795200,3,1402,5.2657657657657655

4209288,4,B003VIVCQE,"I didn't know what to expect from ""The Wild Hunt"". But I didn't expect it to be so harrowing, and so devastating. Having seen a few documentaries about real life LARPers, the concept is familiar to me. But this is a fictional story. The main character is a very likable, attractive guy named Eric, who crashes his big brother's weekend LARP event to find his runaway girlfriend. He just wants to bring her home, and thinks this is all pretty ridiculous. You probably will, too. But there is something deeper at work in these people; a longing for a greater purpose outside their everyday lives, for sure. But in addition to that, the event becomes an outlet for darker, more horrifying tendencies in others. Although the plot is very unlikely, and out of character for LARPers, who are known for being bookish, detail and rule oriented, you could say this is a nightmare scenario.",1321660800,3,880,4.720779220779221
4209289,2,B003VIVCQE,"Both my wife and I are into gaming, but not this type of dress-up/act out gaming.

Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't think the ""players"" gave it their all. They were ignoring ""game decorum"" every 10 seconds or so, so it really made everyone look half-hearted and  silly. There were a few comedic moments here and there which were ok, but the drama was totally uninteresting. Maybe there is a good story here somewhere, but neither my wife nor I could get into this film.

A big thumbs down for us!",1321574400,2,506,4.478260869565218
4209290,4,B003VIVCQE,"When I read the premise of this movie, as well as the outline, it all sounded rather silly and undoable. I was wrong. Could this have been done better? Probably. Given greater resources, it would have picked up a smoother sheen and probably a bit better scripting. But, given everything, this is a remarkable effort.

Here's the scoop. Erik is taking care of his deteriorating father. His girlfriend has left him to hook up with the king of a Live Action Role Playing ensemble. He heads to the roll playing compound to win her back. They are in the midst of a game which stretches out over days. Eric's brother, Bjorn, (who has abandoned Erik in regard to father care responsibilities) is also a role player. Together they try to make all things right.

This movie is amazing in its own right. As others have mentioned, a large amount of respect is paid to the players. They retreat to this world and give it everything they've got while involved. They are organized. They have a well built compound for the games. They have walkie-talkies for communication. They have referees and judges if something needs to be ruled upon. And they party hard when the day's games have finished. The film makers, though, do juxtapose them to the real world and don't shy away from showing that there is a certain amount of silliness to it all. You see this duality in the girlfriend, Lyn, (played by a very fetching Kaniehtiio Horn) who is at once drawn to the splendor and magnificence of it all, but put off when the fantasy is played too strongly. There are hints as to where all this is headed. You have two men in two worlds both vying for the same woman. Something has to give and it does so in brutal fashion. Things do escalate and things do get out of hand. The climax is both sad and horrifying. I feel the film makers should have showed the authorities getting involved at the end. It only makes sense but, for whatever reason, they chose not to.

This was done on a rather limited budget but done extremely well. The camerawork was good enough but some of the shots were downright gorgeous. Editing and music were decent as were the costumes. Were this a larger Hollywood project I couldn't have given it 4 stars, but all things considered, this is more than a commendable outing. If you're at all into role playing games, this is worth seeing. If you're only mildly interested, as am I, it's still more than worth the time needed to watch it. Enjoy",1314403200,4,2447,4.531674208144796
4209291,5,B003VIVCQE,"Having found some info about this randomly on IMDB.com a few weeks back, the Wild Hunt has been in the back of my mind as one of those ""must-see"" indie films ever since. Last night I was able to catch a screening of this on DVD and I was absolutely blown away. The cinematography, colors, storyline, character development - it was all mesmerizing. Not having known that any of this culture existed, I was happy to see how respectful the film makers were of the ""live action role playing"" that this movie is based off of. Nothing seemed cliche, or forced, or mocked at all. I could see the appeal of the ""game"", as well as the incredible ways in which the filmmakers sought to capture the raw humanity of these characters - as people feeling most free to express themselves when they were able to do it as a ""character"" in the game. As you may already know, events do get tense as the storyline progresses. I had forewarning from what I'd already read, but I wasn't prepared for the ways that the movie made me feel. It was absolutely surreal, beautiful, heartbreaking, haunting and truly a smart film. Highly recommended, no question.",1307145600,4,1134,4.563725490196078
4209292,4,B003VIVCQE,"A Canadian film ""The Wild Hunt"" involves LARP, or live-action role-playing game, where participants, usually in costumes, join in the game, acting out the roles given to them. In the game you can be a warrior, a priest, a princess or even an elf. Unlike online games, LARP doesn't use avatars, and the players ""fight"" for entertainment, sometimes using simulated weapons some of which awfully look real.

Now what if someone determined to win back his estranged sweetheart in real world (who happens to be the kidnapped ""queen"" of the game's fantasy world) joins the LARP in Canadian woods, and breaks a few rules there to get what he wants? Well, in short, what if these players are a bit more in characters, on the night of ""The Wild Hunt""?

Ricky Mabe plays Erik trying to persuade his girlfriend Evelyn (Tiio Horn) to come back home. What makes things complicated is, for Evelyn, who is fed up with the drab reality of her life, the roll-playing game is more than just a pastime. Also, Erik's brother Bjorn (Mark A. Krupa), helpful in his own way, is into the game, having so much fun. For him, this is a real Ragnark, great battle of the gods of Norse mythology. Bjorn's harmless joy becomes something else, however, when other players begin to take their roles more seriously

I know nothing about the film's players, but their performances are overall very good. Clearly the film is made with a low budget, but costumes and production designs are decent, and the photography is surprisingly effective (most of the actions take place during the night).

""The Wild Hunt"" is less a horror than a psychological thriller, and though the film is bumpy in places (the role-playing game itself is not very interesting with its hazy rules), and some part of the story is a bit too incredible, the film is pretty good with slick storytelling and some suspenseful moments.",1301702400,,1868,4.756172839506172
