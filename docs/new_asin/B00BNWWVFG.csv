Sure there are a few things that don't quite follow, but if you are a fan of the old Hitchcock and Twilight Zone episodes, you will appreciate this suspenseful puzzler of a movie. Centered around a psychiatrist, his depressed patient, and a fictional medication, things devolve into a murder which we witness. From there, we are never quite sure what is true and what is not. Entertaining, suspenseful, and sure, a few loose ends but who's counting? A fun way to spend an evening, and after the show, you can explain the twists to our companion!",1364256000,46,570,4.767676767676767
5660568,5,B00BNWWVFG,"This is done artfully, and when the movie is over, the dark injustice you feel all over you is called Big Pharma and their psychiatric lies.
The purpose of this film is to make people aware of the feet-of-clay possessed by a Psychiatry bereft of empathy and genius, but full of drugs and control.

This is the first film to fearlessly face the biggest rip-off since Freud recommended cocaine in the 1920s, and claimed it left no dependence or urge to consume more. How can you not trust someone like that, eh? OBTW, he was getting paid by the two Pharmaceutical houses who were making the stuff at the time.

It's very difficult to describe much without spoiling the film, so I'll leave the plot intricacies to others. Suffice to say Law (who is great) begins a ""treatment"" of Rooney Mara with that casual explanation we've all been fed; that somehow - by messing with the the serotonin and dopamine processes in a brain we barely understand, we suppose these chemicals are a scientific answer. In addition, his position as psychiatrist places him as both pawn of the drug company whose approval he seeks, as well as lord and master of an institutionalized patient. There are two hidden and dangerous untruths peddled implicitly by Law's character:
 One is that mental distress is a result of physical abnormalities (fluid imbalance) and these psychiatric drugs: the  anti-psychotics, SSRI's, ADD chemicals - are a scientific answer by ""medicine,"" despite more and more evidence to the contrary.

While I agree with another reviewer that it would be a stretch to see Jude Law's character actually in-reality be put in charge of his previous patient (Mara) after all that's transpired up to that point in the film, THE POINT IS that Psychiatry Professors have - as class projects - pretended symptoms to be admitted to Psychiatric hospitals as patients, and then once admitted, returned to their ""normal selves."" They were REFUSED DISCHARGE! It is not so easy to prove one is sane, and in this country - thanks to Big Pharma -  taking the lowest form of Grad Student, the one with the juvenile personality, and allowing them extraordinary power through the creation of Psychiatry's DSM, its accompanying insurance code, medication and authoritative status within the Justice System, we've created something ""other"" outside the normal justice system. This is the TRUTH the film drives home, and the fascist power resulting.

The DVD that is a MUST SEE is ""The Marketing of Madness,"" which documents much of these heinous activities. Big Pharma has spent millions to discredit it, but the truth is out there for those who will get up off their knees before their psychiatrist or their addictions to psychiatric meds obtained thru their normal doctors and dare to see they've been ""had.""

I've personally walked through the fire of incompetent shrinks, massive doses of anti-psychotic drugs and then having to come off them. Heroin addiction is actually easier to get off than these psychiatric drugs. Remember the motto of a top Big Pharma exec: ""You don't want to kill the patient; and you don't want to cure the patient."" That just leaves ""hooking"" the patient on a drug that will have you in so much mental anguish, anxieties and vulnerabilities trying to get off of it that it can drive people to mass murder. Soderburgh tackles this, and except for a giggle from the movie ""Carnage"" is the only film maker to do so. He has pointed out basic truths, and made a heck of a statement about the unnatural, evil power that Psychiatry and Big Pharma possess; leaving the plot as clothing for this deeper purpose.

What is shown here is the lie that the Psychiatrist ""really knows."" This is merely a subjective human being with - in reality - very little training to be successful in the one-on-one ""talking cure"" that we all used to associate with therapy, but instead, has tremendous (and growing) power - in every way, shape and form - over the lives of the people who come to them.",1364083200,23,3979,4.831130690161527
5660569,3,B00BNWWVFG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Steven Soderbergh's 'Side Effects', first appears as if it's designed as a critique of psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, it becomes more like a Hitchcock thriller. It's a film that keeps your interest but you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit, to appreciate it.

Rooney Mara (looking quite more appealing than her stint as angry Goth in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'), plays Emily Taylor, a seemingly depressed wife of her husband Martin (Channing Tatum), who has just come home after doing four years in prison for insider trading.

When it appears that she tries to kill herself by slamming her car into a wall in a parking garage, she's assigned to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Banks (winningly played by Jude Law). Banks is a fairly typical psychiatrist who prescribes one psychotropic medication after another, hoping that Emily's mood will change. Still feeling forlorn, Banks consults with Emily's former psychiatrist, Victoria (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who recommends that Emily be placed on a new experimental drug, Ablixa. Banks takes the pharmaceutical company's money and convinces Emily to participate in the study.

The stakes are raised when seemingly despondent Emily stabs husband Martin to death but claims she can't remember anything and blames everything on the Ablixa. Suddenly, Banks is no longer the complacent psychiatrist but is now a scapegoat, as the press blames him for dispensing the medication which everyone assumes is the cause of Emily's violent outburst. His patients start leaving him in droves and he's investigated by the State Licensing Board. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical company drops him as one of the testers of the Ablixa study.

Soon, Banks figures out that there's something much more sinister underfoot. Like Hitchcock's 'Wrong Man', he now must clear his name. As Emily has taken a plea bargain in which she pleads guilty by reason of insanity, Banks is assigned to be her psychiatrist at the Ward's Island Criminal Psychiatric facility, and has full say as to whether she will be eventually released or not. And here is where I had the biggest problem with this film. If Banks' reputation is so in tatters (he's been smeared in the press) and the state licensing board is investigating him, why would the court even entertain the idea that he should continue to be involved with Emily? And without this caveat, the film's denouement, could never develop as it does.

So let's suspend our disbelief over this major plot point and see whether the rest of 'Side Effects' has any more credibility. As it turns out, Banks does indeed figure out that Emily was faking all along that she was depressed. He also discovers that Banks turned out to be the former lover of her former psychiatrist, Victoria, who convinces Emily to participate in an incredible scheme to drive the stock price down of pharmaceutical company who's been promoting Ablixa. By selling short, Emily and Victoria end up making a bundle but once Banks figures everything out, he forces Emily to wear a wire and rat out Victoria.

It's pretty much a fantastic scheme and again it involves more suspension of disbelief, since it's not guaranteed that the stock price will go down that much, where the two schemers, will actually make a big profit. Nonetheless, it could remotely happen. Banks being in cahoots with the Assistant District Atttorney to turn Emily but then falsifying her personality profile and illegally ordering her to take mind numbing psychotropic medications such as Thorazine, to shut up her up, seems beyond the pale. Would an ADA risk his job to participate in such an illegal, revenge scheme? I hardly think so.

It's also a bit ironic that a psychiatrist who exceeds his authority by authorizing the administration of psychotropic medications when they are not needed, appears justified, since the patient in question, has gotten away with murder. Whether you like this final scenario or not, one wonders why Emily didn't have an attorney who could have worked to expose Banks' illegal actions. It just seemed a little too easy in the way that Banks, along with his allies, so easily were able to keep Emily as a zombie (all doped up with her medications), without any other third parties becoming involved in her case, and perhaps discovering that the 'good guys' (i.e. Banks and company), were suddenly doing a bunch of bad things.

'Side Effects' is a passable 'Hollywood-type' thriller. It has the requisite good acting and interesting plot reversals, but ultimately not everything adds up.",1363824000,70,4610,5.071240105540897
5660570,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Oh yeah, I like this movie. For my money, Steven Soderbergh is one of our best directors in terms of quality and versatility. He manages to make genre-focused B-like films (""Haywire"") more A-like. Here he takes a mystery-thriller that could have been just lurid in tone and makes it lurid with Hitchcock style.

Rooney Mara convincingly plays Emily Taylor, the wife of a convicted white collar criminal (Channing Tatum) who is just released from prison for insider trading. Trying to get their lives back together is difficult as Emily seems to be drifting into depression to the point of trying to kill herself. Seen in the hospital ER by a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) Emily is released on the condition she seeks regular treatment. She agrees.

After trying several prescriptions that she doesn't like for various reasons, she finds one that seemingly works wonders. She's happy, her sex drive improves, her husband is happy and things appear to be progressing. Emily is exposed to one side effect however. She sleepwalks. During one of these episodes, tragedy ensues and Emily is arrested. But who is to blame? Emily, the drug manufacturer or the doctor (Banks) who prescribed it?

A previous shrink (excellent Catherine Zeta-Jones) Emily had seen while her husband was in prison re-enters the picture as a collaborator with Dr. Banks. Soderbergh and his ""Contagion"" scriptwriter, Scott Z. Burns concoct a wonderful mystery complete with sharp directional turns. See it.",1363651200,,1489,5.144628099173554
5660571,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Side Effects is a film you can't really describe without giving anything away. Avoid the trailers if possible, make it through the slow build up and you will get quite a few surprises in the second half. Easily one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time. Jude Law in his best performance in years as a psychiatrist and Rooney Mara, fresh off of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, knocks it out of the park again as his depressed patient. She has become one of my favorite actresses. Catherine Zeta-Jones is effective and Channing Tatum has little to do, but is adequate enough. Never boring and often surprising, if this is Steven Soderbergh's last movie, he went out at the top of his game.",1363132800,102,699,4.46875
5660572,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Emily (Rooney Mara) is clinically depressed. She has been seeing a psychologist (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Her white collar criminal husband (Channing Tatum) is getting out of jail, which leads to more depression. Having failed a suicide attempt, Emily is placed on medication and does the unthinkable. At this point the film goes into an odd mystery/thriller, one where everyone knows who done it. Just when you think you have it figured out, it twists, having more twists than Taylor Swift having break-up songs. Jude Law plays Dr. Jonathan Banks, a man caught in the middle of all of this.

I didn't know what to expect going into this feature. It is best not to read the reviews as it is impossible to write anything without giving away too much of the plot. If you like mystery thrillers with twists and clues that hurt your head like a Hitchcock masterpiece, this one will fit the bill. If you know anyone who takes meds for depression, then you can enjoy the film on a different level.

5660573,4,B00BNWWVFG,"I know a little something about the side-effects of psychological drugs, and the way they can go wrong.

So the idea of ""Side Effects"" was an interesting one -- a psychiatrist begins to suspect that a drug-induced killing may have actually been a devious murder plot. The first half initially reeks of anti-psychiatric propaganda (seriously, they list just about every antidepressant out there!), but it turns out to be a clever set-up for a Hitchcockian second half.

After four years in prison for insider trading, Martin Taylor (Channing Tatum) is released and reunited with his wife Emily (Rooney Mara). But not all is well with Emily. She shows signs of severe depression, even attempting suicide by driving her car into a brick wall, and almost leaping in front of a subway car. Her new shrink Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) tries out several antidepressants, finally settling on an experimental drug called Ablixa.

Emily says that the drug is helping her, but it's also causing her to sleepwalk. Then she stabs her husband to death, and claims to remember nothing of it. At first, Banks is tormented by what seems to have been a massive mistake, and the bad press that is threatening to sink his career. But slowly he begins to suspect that Emily may have been faking her symptoms, and that she murdered Martin deliberately.

""Side Effects"" left a bad taste in my mouth at first, because through the first half, it seemed to be practically cataloguing every single bad thing that could happen to you if you take antidepressants. It was like watching an anti-depressant propaganda film by the Church of Scientology -- ""if you take antidepressants, you'll end up murdering people! That's how it works!""

But Steven Soderburgh twists the entire story around in the second half, when it quietly morphs into a sort of medical noir. He keeps the direction muted, sterile and pale, but there's always the sensation that sharks are swimming just under the story's surface, ready to drag Banks down with them. It has a very Hitchcockian flavor, especially when Banks is faced with false accusations if he keeps digging for the truth.

And it brings up some interesting ethical problems. Should he preserve his marriage and career and let a murderer go free, or should he try to do the right thing and risk everything? How can a person be punished if double jeopardy protects them?

Jude Law and Rooney Mara are the centerpiece of this movie, and Law is simply brilliant as a devoted, intelligent doctor who is dragged into a dark, twisted little scheme, and has to resort to some dirty tactics to get himself out. Mara isn't quite as memorable -- she does a good job, but she acts dopey ALL the time, even when she's not supposed to be. Catherine Zeta Jones does a decent job as a rather brief character, and Channing Tatum... is mainly there to die.

""Side Effects"" starts off on a rather odd footing, but it steadies itself into a quiet, rather unnerving noir mystery in the second half. Also: Jude Law is amazing.",1362614400,9,3014,4.782692307692308

Following the spectacular ""Contagion"" Soderbergh brings us this somewhat more intimate puzzler featuring a quartet of excellent actors. Yes, I include Channing Tatum in that group, as he has turned in some very good comic and dramatic work in recent years, and he is solid here. Basic summary: Tatum is leaving prison after having served time for insider trading, and his wife (Rooney Mara) and mother (played by the great Ann Dowd) both seem to be eagerly awaiting his release. I say eagerly because, at least in this genre, not everything is as it appears, but anything more would spoil the marvelous plot-twist. A likeably unlikeable Catherine Zeta-Jones is a treat, but the center of ""Side Effects"" is really Jude Law. IMBD says Law was hesitant to make the film, as he had never played a husband and Dad (being one in real life) and also hadn't for quite a while used his real accent. He needn't have worried, as of course Law is pitch perfect as the smart, compassionate psychiatrist who gets emeshed in a complex web of intrigue. As his non-arc'ing foil, Mara is simply superb: is she a loving wife, or something else? Again, no spoiliers. Everything is as expected in a Soderbergh production; first rate camera work and lighting, moody score. But the script and acting are front and center. And they won't disappoint.

Dr. Banks begins to subscribe a variety of prescription drugs but they do not seem to be working. Then he decides to give her an experimental drug but what happens next causes Dr. Banks some great concern.

5660630,5,B00BNWWVFG,"This is a fascinating really suspenseful film that grips and holds viewers attention throughout the drama, without let up. It begins when a husband is released from prison. He was imprisoned for insider stock trading, a rather lucrative endeavor. We see his wife looking very depressed and apparently attempting suicide by crashing her car against a stone wall. She goes to a psychiatrist who gives her pills for her depression. She moves from one pill to another. Then she suggests to the psychiatrist that her friend took a certain pill and felt better. He prescribed the pill for her. She had been seen by another psychiatrist in the past, a female, but now saw the male psychiatrist.
She begins to act strange, including sleep walking. During the sleep walking she does things that she says she cannot remember when she awakens. During one such episode she harms her husband.
There is a trial. Will she be found guilty or innocent because the pills made her act as she did?
Is the psychiatrist guilty of some criminal act because he prescribed the pills?
Whether he should be guilty, the general public and his colleagues think he is guilty.
But then there is a twist, which intensifies the drama considerably.

I don't know how to explain why hypothetically, though, so here's a spoiler: SPOILER ALERT:.............................................................................................................................................Emily, who murdered her husband and pled not guilty by reason of insanity, wasn't really insane. She conspired with her former psychiatrist to kill him because they could make money this way via securities fraud. I won't go into how. Suffice it to say that, in the end, in exchange for being released from the mental hospital she agrees to help catch her partner and turn her in. Emily figures she might as well, because the trial is over and she can't be tried for murder twice.
That's true, but...she CAN be tried for conspiracy to commit securities fraud AND conspiracy to commit murder. Neither of these depend on a guilty or innocent outcome in the original case.
Nobody mentions this, however.
Another problem is that there don't seem to be any social workers or patient advocates here. The main character (a psychiatrist) makes the unilateral decision to remove Emily from the hospital to help implicate her former partner, then to punish Emily, he puts her back in. Then his life just continues. Nobody seems to notice he is doing this? He's using patients to solve legal cases. And he's not a police officer or a lawyer.

Jude Law, Channing Tatum and Catherine Zeta-Jones were wonderful too look at.
But this plot....Oh wow....

I watched this movie twice and I STILL don't really know WHY this girl killed her husband....... She was mad that he went to jail for insider trading? Really? Did we even get the details about that? Did he actually do it? They never went into it like they did how she hooked up with the Female Psychiatist.

And I'm sorry...I didn't have closure with Dr Sebbert being caught. #1. they got her on criminal charges and federal, but she'll probably plea bargain like the wife did. #2. The money is still there, hidden so all they have to do is bide their time....Both women will eventually compare notes and get each other out or prison and the asylum. Dr Banks won't be Em's doctor forever...

And speaking of Dr Banks....isn't he AFRAID of these psychos?? Em KILLED her husband. For GOING to prison. She could have divorced him but that was too simple.

Oh and what was her motivation??? they said that there was no life insurance policy. So who was the beneficiary, his mother?? If so, how did Dr Sebbert get her hands on the money?
And there is no other money.....the husband was scrambling trying to find a job, remember? Because for SOME reason, despite being married to someone with a wealthy family(per her flashbacks when she was talking to Dr Banks) She was destitute and angry and lost health insurance. Really?

Speaking of health insurance. What happened to the lady that was agreed to the trial for the nonrelated meds study? What was the point of that scene?

I thought that the kicker was that Dr Sebbert was Em's MOTHER or something(since we didn't know ANYTHING about her family or background)....
but nope...she was a Dr who sexually abused her patient. They didn't even mention that when they were calling out the charges against her.
That one should have been first....as well as physical assault for clonking Dr Banks of the back of the head with her Prada bag.

Jude Law couldn't quite pull off the role of victimized psychiatrist with real authenticity.

What did I think?

Hands up if you like a well-woven thriller with a good twist or three Thats all you really need to consider if you are questioning whether to see this. Its hard to even talk about the film without major spoilers. What I can say is that Side Effects is a classy production, thanks to director Steven Soderberghs (Traffic and We Need To Talk About Kevin) renowned talents. As the lost young wife Emily, Mara (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) shows her range, proving she really is one to watch. Law puts in a solid, if predictable, performance as her doctor, and Catherine Zeta-Jones takes an impressive turn as Emilys cool former psychiatrist. With so much to choose from at the theater right now, you could wait for Side Effects (and its lack of visual candy) to come out on DVD but its still definitely worth your time.",1423958400,,1047,4.588235294117647

I will also say, even though Jude Law was the considered main actor in the movie 'Side Effects', there is something about the actress Rooney Mara that seems to captivate a movie, and that is a rare ability in the world of movie making  Rooney Mara captivated this movie 'Side Effects'  and I was pleasantly surprised.  Having just purchased the movie 'Side Effects'  just to  observe Rooney Mara's acting performance which literally captivated me and took over the movie 'Side Effects'.  I'm only concerned about one important thing concerning Rooney Mara as an actress, that she doesn't get typed cast.  In the 'Girl With Dragon the Tattoo, which was an excellent movie, Rooney Mara played a character that was mentally challenged, but in the movie 'Side Effects' she plays a character that is definitely mentally disturbed, but its a wonderful movie.",1418860800,3,1075,4.927777777777778

5660734,3,B00BNWWVFG,"Im still not sure how I feel about this film.  The thriller part of it was pretty engrossing and well done, though the drama half had its fair share of issues, into which I will now delve.  (Warning: Spoilerific review below.)

First, lets discuss the quality of the acting.  I thought Jude Law and Rooney Mara were perfect with the latter falling off toward the end, but Ill get to that.  Channing Tatum is pretty much exactly what you would expect, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was good as always, nothing to write home to Mother about save for the fact that her publicized battles with bipolar disorder gave me the distinct impression that she was more qualified for her role than anyone else in the film.

Okay, so - what was the point of Martin (Tatum) being in jail?  Was it to spawn Emilys (Mara) depression?  If so, then sure, life events can certainly trigger depression, but the type of depression that Emily suffered from (which was hinted in passing to have existed before her husbands arrest) seems to be of the more frustrating kind - the kind that exists even when life seems normal on the outside.

The film flip-flopped on this concept, since Emily seems to be relapsing back into what is hinted to be long-term depression at the party on the boat, yet she explains the origin of her depression to Dr. Banks (Law) as beginning with the arrest of her husband and realizing that all of her problems began and ended with him.  Though, the film then completely craps on this concept by the end when Emily reveals that she, with the help of her lover doctor (Jones), was faking it to make her murder of Martin more believable.

The filmmakers could have really been onto something here. They could have explored the concept of Big Pharma and the millions it makes off of people who never feel any better, no matter which drugs they're on (a direction they seemed to be headed for in the beginning).  They could have also tackled the stigma against mental illness and how everyone around Emily claims that theyve been there, too, yet theres still a lack of acceptance to the point where everyone makes their confessions in quiet voices.

But no, depression is used as nothing more here than as a tool for some broad to use in order to kill her husband and get rich, along with her lover doctor whos peddling the drug that made her do it and teaching her how to act sad to be more convincing.

It was when Emily confessed that Maras acting went from great to disappointing.  Despite the fact that Emilys not as depressed as she led us to believe and is smiling at the end, she seems like shes already under the effects of the Thorazine with which shell eventually be plied.  Her mood never changes, even after the big reveal.

The first time in the film that Emily is finally on drugs is in the closing scene, and the drugs are used as a form of punishment for a murderer.  Not the best note to go out on if you want to tackle the stigma, though that never seemed to be the intention.

As was the intention, I was duped by this film and rather disappointed.  I was impressed with how well Mara conveyed the realism of a panic attack, coupled with the desperate hopelessness that one can feel while suffering from a mental illness and the lack of understanding from those around her (as Martin says in passing, its the culture), only for Emily to turn out to be nothing more than a convincing actress.  To sum up, the acting was good and the story was okay, despite its holes, but the exploitation of drugs and depression in this film got under my skin.",1409270400,,3558,4.485271317829457

Maybe that's not the right word because the four main characters all are so flawed and end up doing very dumb things that cost them all bar one at the very end they really aren't as smart as they think they are.

Anyway, for Rooney Mara's performance alone you should check this out. She's mesmerizing as the patient under the psychotropic influence. Even though Jude Law gives his usual strong performance, Mara blows him and everyone else off the screen. Yes, folks, she's that good.

If you dig arrows aimed straight at the drug-dispensing psychiatric world as well as Americans seeming desire to have better lives through chemistry, you'll love this. Even if you don't, as a stand-alone thriller, it's terrific.",1409184000,,1045,4.832402234636872

5660750,5,B00BNWWVFG,"I don't understand the large number of people who say this movie was a boring waste of time and that they turned it off after only 20 or 30 minutes -- they totally missed out.  Granted, Tatum Channing is in the story so barely that yes if you checked it out purely to see him, then this movie will disappoint (and, no, this movie is NOT '21 Jump Street' in any way, shape or form!  Thank God!)

And yes I wasn't quite sure where the story was going during the first 20-30 minutes, either -- but this is not a negative, since it is usually difficult to fully comprehend what is happening in the early stages of a complicated psychological thriller (both 'Memento' and  'Inception' come to mind).  It seems relevant that I recently introduced my teenaged sons to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and for the first half hour they were bored stiff and groaned about being made to continue watching -- until Jack Nicholson's character sucked them in and (of course) by the end they proclaimed it one 'of the best movies ever.'  (Duh)

And finally, yes, I think the torid secret relationship between the primary female characters is more than a bit fantastic (i.e., at the outer edges of believability) but truth IS often stranger than fiction, and although not probable, it certain is POSSIBLE.  Many well-done movie plots have stretched the limits of believability (can you say 'Thelma and Louise drive over a cliff'?) and yet somehow the films still work, are still thought-provoking stories which deserve the label of 'good cinema.'

Here is what I thought MOST believable about this film:  that the wife who lost everything when her husband went to prison could not forgive him and faked concern simply so she could murder him and, through conniving with her unethical therapist, make a S--TLoad of money at the very same time.  From the very beginning of the film I found it not credible that the Tatum Channing character and his wife seemed to pick back up where they left off so easily after he had been away in prison for 5 years.  But it was this very unbelievability in the beginning which helped make the story more believable in the end, when the viewer begins to realize (along with Jude Law's character) that the wife's forgiving, loving attitudes (and 'depressed victim' posture) were a lie and charade all along.

Sorry to be a spoiler, but please watch the movie anyway.  If you like subtlety and detail, you will like this film.  If you enjoy seeing 'truth win' and the marginalized, scapegoated hero obtain redemption in the end (like Tim Robbin's character in Shawshank Redemption, Will Smith's character in Enemy of the People, Kevin Spacey's character in The Life of David Gale, Sandra Bullock's character in The Net) you will ADORE this film.  I myself have been unfairly scapegoated and summarily dumped by everyone I knew as a result -- like Jude Law's character -- and so of course it was very gratifying to watch him persevere in doing whatever it took to clear his name and prevailing in the end all on his own, as a result of his own effort.",1404864000,,3064,4.656771799628943
5660751,4,B00BNWWVFG,"I won't give anything away, but I thought this was a very well-acted movie with a good twist at the end.

5660772,3,B00BNWWVFG,"Side Effects (Steven Soderbergh, 2013)

How in the flying hell do I review Side Effects? Every problem I had with the film (and they are legion) comes after the Big Twist(TM) that appears about halfway through, and which has been remarkably unspoiled by the mediaI may even be revealing too much by saying that there is, in fact, a Big Twist. The interesting thing is that before that happens, this is Soderbergh's best movie since The Limey, his last great one. There is actually an attempt in the script to make the psychology more than pop-psych 101, and despite my low expectations for anything Soderbergh does these days, I found myself grudgingly impressed. Having Jude Law on board didn't hurt, either, as the doctor spouting all that comforting-yet-incisive stuff. I didn't even hate Channing Tatum in the first half of this movie, and that takes some doing. But then, well, Scott Z. Burns (who also collaborated with Soderbergh on Contagion) had to go and make a huge Gordian knot of everything. The problem with Gordian knots is that if you don't tie them tight enough, they end up full of holes.

Plot: Law (The Wisdom of Crocodiles) plays Jonathan Banks, a psychiatrist who is called to the bedside of Emily Taylor (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Rooney Mara), a woman who just tried to commit suicide by driving her car into a wall the day after her husband Martin (Tatum, of Magic Mike) was released from prison after doing a stint for insider trading. This being the twenty-first century, Banks prescribes her antidepressants, but nothing seems to work for her, and after a consultation with her former psychiatrist, Victoria Siebert (Chicago's Catherine Zeta-Jones), and enticed by a fifty thousand dollar stipend from a drug company, he prescribes a new SSRI called Ablixa...with disastrous consequences. (This is not a spoiler, as the first shot of the film shows the consequences.) But, it turns out, and I am going to consider this not a spoiler since you may find yourself looking at your watch and wondering what Soderbergh's going to do with the other hour of this movie, all of this is setup for what is really going on here...

...about which I cannot tell you a blessed thing, as above, as far as what's actually going on. I will tell you that what's actually going on quickly morphs into something bog-standard. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, when you've got a cast of this caliber. Fifteen years ago, Soderbergh might have been able to turn this into a stylistic treat, if one laden with empty calories, and that you probably would have forgotten a month or two after seeing it. But pre-Ocean's Soderbergh and post-Ocean's Soderbergh are two entirely different beasts (all the evidence you need can be had by contrasting 1999's The Limey and 2011's Haywire), and the current incarnation of Soderbergh makes this into exactly the sort of wet-cardboard mess one would expect. Still, the performances by the mains, especially Law and Mara, are credible enough to make it worth watching, even if you find yourself groaning rather regularly by the last twenty or so minutes of the movie. ** ",1395705600,,3124,4.855534709193246

""evil psychiatric drugs"" and that I might think the movie unfair.  When I watched the
film I saw the focus was not really on medications--the focus was on evil people.
Nobody's motivation is what it seems on the surface.  Competent mystery-suspense
movie with a good cast.  If that's your cup of tea I think you'll enjoy the movie.
If you think it's any kind of political statement about mental illness or about the
pharmaceutical industry...it's not really a political film, it's a suspense film.  See if you

5660792,5,B00BNWWVFG,"Drugs and depression. Steven Soderbergh takes both subjects head- on in Side Effects, a film that examines how the lives of a group of individuals inevitability become tied together by mental illness and chance.

 Emily Taylors (Rooney Mara) life is on the brink of total collapse. After waiting four years for her husband to get out of prison, her depression finally overtakes her. She ends up in the Emergency Room after a failed suicide attempt. Here she encounters Doctor Jonathan Banks (Jude Law).

Jude Law doesnt seem a likely psychiatrist, but it doesnt matter, he pulls it off and all the other characters fall into line around him; although Jude Law is the heart of the film, Soderbergh is undeniably at the helm here. He is the brain. Soderberghs characters habituate their New York City with 100% believability, believability so intense in fact, it is haunting.

The viewer envies the characters and their glamorous lives, even more as they destroy themselves. The viewer needs to remind themself that these characters do not exist, and this is a fiction, be it an excellently written one by Scott Z. Burns. As a screenwriter I watch this film as a lesson in how to build intersecting plot lines.

Banks comes across as a doctor legitimately interesting in helping people, so when Emily claims to be living in a depressive fog Banks takes on the task of trying his best to help her. Emilys condition begins to improve, but in the midst of the improvement tragedy strikes, and it threatens to bring down both patient and doctor.

As a psychiatrist Dr. Banks did what psychiatrists do, he prescribed drugs. Then more drugs. Then even more drugs. Even though it seems absurd at times just how many medications are being dolled here, for anyone who has ever experienced psychiatric treatment, they will realize that these procedures are standard. So is this a jab at psychiatrys habit of throwing handfuls of pills at people in mental distress? However mind-boggling it may be that the treatment for nearly every mental condition is medication, this film doesnt come across as serious critique of psychiatric drugs, or the pharmaceutical industry.

There is a fog covering the whole film, figuratively in the melancholic tone, and literally in the shades of grey of the cinematography. This fog further complicates an already complex plot, but once you can piece together what has occurred, as I did hours afterwards, you will not be able to shake this films dark presence.

In the end it is not drug use that is being criticized here, but rather the avaricious soul-sucking void, the characters' needs to engulf their surroundings, and the sociopathic culture that made them this way.

Amazing!

The core problem is that the basic plot is so preposterous and so full of holes you could drive a semi truck through.

You have seen this movie before - there is not one new idea in the entire film.

The primary actors stumble through their parts as if they were heavily medicated. Rooney Mara is particularly inept and annoying. ""sullen posing"" is not acting.

Fans of Channing Tatum will be particularly disappointed by how he is wasted in the film.

A former wall street hotshot Channing Tatum is married to a nervous wreck Emily (Rooney Mara) who is crazy enough to drive her car into the wall and thus landing  with Jonathan ( Jude Law) as her psychiatrist who puts her on a new drug Ablixia, which makes her even more crazier. But this is a movie and there is a lot of bad marriages and deceptions. This is where the movie starts to take shape and throws a light on the entire nexus of medical, legal and moral structures.

5660860,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Someone called director Steven Soderbergh ""the best hack director ever."" After seeing this it's easy to see why.

Here's the scoop. Emily (Rooney Mara) is finally reuniting with her husband (Channing Tatum) who's been in prison for four years on insider trading. Past issues of loneliness and vulnerability creep up on her so she sees a shrink (Jude Law) who treats her and proscribes a string of pharmaceuticals. These cause further problems for her including sleepwalking. During one episode she stabs her husband to death. She skates the charge on an insanity plea, but the incident also causes problems for Jude, and as he digs deeper the entire incident takes on a whole new color.

I like these kinds of movies. It kept me guessing very close to the end. At a certain point I knew what might happen, but I wanted to know how they would pull it off. Some liken it to a Hitchcock mystery/thriller and they're right. This does start out (as many have noted) as an indictment on the psychiatric/pharmaceutical communities, then changes to thriller gear. I loved the way the story unfolded and how Jude began to put the pieces together. Then they add the note regarding Emily's previous shrink (Catherine Zeta Jones), and Jude's sinking further into a near helpless situation, and I was really hooked. As in the best of Hitchcock, the viewer wants (needs) to see the innocent guy claw his way out of the web.

Now for the directing. Soderbergh isn't a flashy director, but this was efficient. I always thought he had the camera in the right place and he seemed to know how to set up one shot to transition into the next. I also liked the color palette. It was a pretty movie with colors being not too washed out nor over-saturated. The performances were good, as was the editing and music. I had a few minor quibbles, and I'm guessing a second viewing would reveal some plot holes, but this had me hook, line and sinker.

For those looking for a good brain tease, this is a doozy.",1379635200,2,1981,4.635327635327635

5660862,2,B00BNWWVFG,"I expected more from Soderbergh but his output has been extremely inconsistent the last few years.  The plot twists in SIDE EFFECTS were neither unusual nor unpredictable and the acting consistently bland.  Art direction, cinematography and scoring were far below expectations, with Thomas Newman delivering an unmemorable dud of a soundtrack (shockingly, as he is one of my favorites).  Jude Law ALMOST saves the film with a fine, understated turn, but the mannered Ms. Mara is outdone only by the stone faced Ms. Zeta-Jones who spends 30 minutes of screen time looking constipated and ill-mannered.  The obligatory lesbian scene was laughable in its construction, timing, and (lack of) passion.  Overall, a real lemon.",1379548800,3,720,5.336283185840708

5660865,4,B00BNWWVFG,"A hardworking Manhattan psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) prescribes Ablixa, a (fictional) new drug, for his new patient Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara) who has tried to commit suicide. The experimental medication, however, seems to have side effects that could ruin the lives of Emily and those surrounding her including Jonathan.

Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Emily's previous psychiatrist Dr. Victoria Siebert. Channing Tatum, star of the director Steven Soderbergh's ""Magic Mike,"" is Emily's husband Martin, which is a comparatively small but important role here.

Soderbergh's entertaining thriller is well-acted and slick enough that it almost makes us forget the implausibility of the whole story. The screenplay of Scott Z. Burns, who has worked with Soderbergh for ""Contagion"" and ""The Informant!,"" again weaves social issues like pharmaceutical industry into the thriller story, where an innocent protagonist finds him/herself in unusual (and uncomfortable) situations.

Of course, this kind of story - some call it Hitchcockian - is nothing new. What differentiates ""Side Effects"" is the confident and polished direction of Steven Soderbergh, who manages to keep us interested. Not exactly his best, but ""Side Effects"" is still worth watching for its storytelling skills.",1379203200,,1280,5.761904761904762

Rooney Mara was fantastic--I loved her in ""Dragon Tattoo"" and can't wait to see her career unfold--and Catherine Zeta-Jones was great in her return to the screen after a long stint on Broadway.

Full of twists and turns and you had no idea where the film was going.  Jude Law was great as was Rooney Mara, and I have to say a real eye opener to others about the drug industry and how people are led down the yellow brick road to disaster with pharmaceuticals.",1377820800,,454,4.1477272727272725
5660888,5,B00BNWWVFG,"I'm kind of upset that Rooney Mara never found incredible success after her incredible turn in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in 2011. There are clearly two more movies to be made in the trilogy, but for whatever reason, those haven't happened yet. When everyone was starting to forget about her, along comes ""Side Effects"".

It's hard to think of a director with a better track record than Stephen Soderbergh. He's had a few duds, but he's made more excellent films in the past decade than anyone who immediately springs to mind. ""Side Effects"" could be his last picture. The director has announced that he wants to take extended time off from directing films, and that's very sad to me. Because ""Side Effects"" is a masterful film that gets better and better with each viewing.

I had the pleasure to see ""Side Effects"" in the theater. It's one of the most genuinely surprising films I've seen in a long time. It follows Emily (Mara), a depressed young woman, who after a suicide attempt, starts on a new antidepressant drug under the care of her doctor, Dr. Banks (Jude Law). Bad things happen and people get hurt.

It's pivotal that you know as little about this movie as possible when you go into it. There are so many twists and turns, and it is so clever. Every time when you think you know where this movie is going, it takes a surprising turn. After a pivotal event happens in the film's first act, the whole game changes. Everything becomes much more interesting. A very tangled web is weaved. It stops before it becomes farfetched and ridiculous. It's a postmodern Hitchcock thriller. The scary part is the realism, and how possible this stuff is.

It's really two different movies. At first, it's an expose on the corrupt pharmaceutical industry. It's also an engaging psychological thriller in the vein of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". When a film tries to be more than one kind of movie, it usually crashes and burns, but that isn't the case here. I enjoyed both entries in this ""double feature"" immensely.

Not to mention, there is flawless acting from everybody involved here. Soderbergh has a knack for getting good performances out of his actors. Rooney Mara is Oscar worthy, in my humble opinion. You never exactly know how to feel about her character, and she clearly realizes that this is important. that is. I had alot of pleasure watching Catherine Zeta Jones in such a fascinating part.

If this does turn out to be Soderbergh's swan song, it's him going out on top, creatively. It's the best thriller I've seen in a very long time, and proves to me that creativity isn't dead in American cinema. ""Side Effects"" is a true original, which is something you don't see very often in movies these days.",1377734400,,2728,4.684759916492693

An odd film that skids the surface of medicine and the problems of drugs. Take one drug to one problem and it leads to another problem. Then we have a thriller when a discredited doctor starts to see a different picture. Is he being paranoid? Is his own downfall making him clutch to straws. Then there is the patient and double victim of a terrible crime. It is a fresh prespective to see a thriller from someone else than a cop, lawyer or news reporter. It could have been a brilliant film. The problem was with the pace of the story. Slow it was but the worst part was that the introduction took up the first 50 minutes of the film, that is to say before it became a thriller. The story before that is of a seriously depressed woman coping with her life. Even once the thriller begins it is slow.

5660898,5,B00BNWWVFG,"Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects sneaked into the theaters and while I was busy dusting my room it exited just as quietly.  Wish I had seen this on the big screen because it is the best Brian De Palma film since Femme Fatale at least, maybe Raising Cain.  However Netflix provided it just fine, though what is with their new policy of suppressing extras on their rental copies--you have to buy the DVD is you want to see ""Behind the Scenes of Side Effects""?  Good thing I didn't really want to see more of the movie (except maybe of the titanic love scene between Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum) otherwise I might have been serious;y pissed and that ain't pleasant!

By now (since this is the 510th review on this site) you probably know the general drift of the movie and how reviewers can't really talk about it past the first 20 minutes or so of the film, otherwise they will be revealing some serious spoilers.  In fact just announcing that there are twists and turns in a film is sort of a spoiler, isn't it?  From the very beginning one is on the lookout, especially when the reviewer says, ""Things are not what they seem.""  But that's just what happens in this.  I for one, even knowing that things are not what they seem, was totally unprepared for the death around which the rest of the story revolves.  Perhaps this is what audiences felt like when Janet Leigh went into the shower in Psycho, and something they just didn't expect occurred on the screen.  But, and I hate to say it, but there's a good chance that Rooney Mara out Psycho's Anthony Perkins in this movie.  She won't win the Oscar, but Tony Perkins didn't either, and the two of them will forever live in the category of immortal screen performances.  I saw the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and it was OK, but here she takes acting to a new level and seems to be having the time of her life doing it!  Maybe David Fincher was overcontrolling and Soderbergh allows her to do whatever she likes on film, but from Mara's very first entrance you know something has changed and she has become a great star.  I wish I had Pauline Kael's way with words, for Kael wrote beautifully about Jane Fonda's emergence from kook oddity to acting greatness when she reviewed They Shoot Horses, Don't They, naming Jane Fonda as the natural successor to Bette Davis--and that shocked The New Yorker readers at the time, for to them Fonda was Barbarella or the girl from Barefoot in the Park.  You know what this movie reminded me of (I mean Side Effects)?  Most of you are too young, but years ago there was a movie called Malice, with Alec Baldwin as a doctor and Bill Paxton and Nicole Kidman as, you know I don't remember what they were (college professors?) and the whole movie shifted after forty minutes into the kind of thing you can't believe you're seeing, allowing, if I may put it this way, Kidman a chance to flex her acting muscles for the first time.  After that, people stopped saying, wow, she's tall, is she from Australia?  Just like Rooney Mara here, she wanted to be bad.  Not good-bad, but evil.

OK, Side Effects isn't very good as a movie perhaps (neither was Malice come to think of it) but nowadays any film that provides something a little bit different is worth hunting down, and this has it in Spades.  Maybe it was a mistake to cast Jude Law in the central role, it's too soon after Soberbergh's Contagion in which he was also obsessed with the side effects of pharmaceuticals?  This hits too close to some, baby!  These roles, together with his parts in Gattaca and A.I., show very little range but reveal why he is probably Donna Haraway's favorite star if I know my cyborg theory....",1377302400,2,3670,4.502262443438914

5660905,2,B00BNWWVFG,"SIDE EFFECTS (2013) has three main characters who look very nice on the outside, appear to be very nice on the inside, but may not be all they seem. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Jude Law play the parts of a couple psychiatrists, and Rooney Mara plays the part of a depressed woman who was first Zeta-Jones' patient and then Law's patient. And the medication that Law prescribes to Mara turns out to have dangerous side effects, which may include sleep-walking ... and sleep-cooking ... AND apparently much much more.

Progressing quite slowly, SIDE EFFECTS keeps us in suspense for more than half its length as to WHAT kind of film it really is - an expos of the drug industry? a psychological thriller? a murder mystery? a revenge tale? or ... ?

Then, once it becomes clear just what has taken place, the film's wheels begin to come loose ... and by the ending, all the wheels fall off.

We ask ourselves things like ""WHY did Catherine Zeta-Jones' character do that really stupid thing to Jude Law's character?"" ""HOW did Jude Law's character ever begin to see daylight just by spending a couple days on the Internet?"" ""WHAT made him think he was on the right track?"" and ""WHY would Zeta-Jones' character believe what Jude Law's character is telling her?""

*SPOILER ALERT* - Then, at the end, after Jude Law's character has found a way to destroy the mind of a patient who lied to him, we ask ourselves things like ""What about his HIPPOCRATIC OATH as a doctor, let alone his integrity and honor as a human being?"" and ""Now that he has almost turned her into a vegetable, HOW is she going to testify at the trial of her accomplice?""

The main problem is with the SCRIPT: besides multiple plot holes, it is riddled with massively faulty morality. And the audience apparently is expected to root for and admire the winner at the end of a Dog-Eat-Dog contest. I'm reminded of a parallel case: a disgusting short mystery story by Colin Dexter in which his Inspector Morse and Sgt. Lewis, otherwise very honorable and lovable characters, both connive to FABRICATE FALSE EVIDENCE against a man they cannot honestly and lawfully convict.

If I were giving this movie a letter grade, in my judgment it deserves a low ""D"", perhaps even a ""D-"". And why not an ""F""?

Well, despite the seriously flawed script, Rooney Mara's performance as a many-faceted person is quite good, and the film DOES provide us with a mildly interesting PUZZLE to piece together, despite its totally wretched conclusion. To draw another comparison, I'm also reminded of an old joke in which a house guest is given breakfast that includes an egg which was turning bad; he politely eats all of it, and when asked how it was, he replies, ""Parts of it were quite good!""",1377129600,5,2727,4.66875

Some may describe Side Effects  as a thriler but I see this film as "" THE LONG GRIFT"". Jude Law seems to be the mark who begins to realize he is being played. How he unravels the plot against him is improbable but does make the last twenty minutes exciting with justice being served. Cathrine Zeta-Jones is wonderfully slick and as gorgeously evil as ever. R.Mara.and C.Channing  play their perspective roles so naturally you feel as if these characters.are people we know and despise in our world. The supporting cast are very convincing as friends who are just not there when you need them the most.

5660953,5,B00BNWWVFG,"SIDE EFFECTS is a harrowing story full of pharmaceutical abuse, psychiatric deception, financial trickery and the ugly side of human behavior. While it is NOT a ""feel good"" movie, it IS a well acted and well written film that will command your attention throughout, continuously surprise you, and leave you unsettled.

Jude law plays Jonathan Banks, a psychiatrist treating Emily Taylor, a woman who deliberately drove her car into a wall following her criminal financier husband Martin's release from prison. Upon her release from the hospital she agrees to visit the doctor regularly and take anti-depressants to regulate her moods. As one might guess from the title, it's these ""side effects"" that will drive the plot of this movie.

My personal advice here is to avoid reviews that want to describe any more of the plot...writer Scott Z. Burns (THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, CONTAGION) and director Steven Soderbergh (ERIN BROCKOVICH, CONTAGION) really pack this film with intrigue, switchbacks and double crosses, creating such a series of claustrophobic twists and turns that it's difficult at times to know who's the victim and who's the villain. That's a lot of the fun, and not knowing what lies ahead makes this a delicious agony to watch.

As for the acting, I really believe this is one of Jude Law's better roles; he really gets to demonstrate a wide range of emotional stress. Rooney Mara, too, gets to demonstrate a different side of her than she demonstrated in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  In fact, the entire cast is first rate with Catherine Zeta Jones and Channing Tatum rounding out the central foursome. They are, in a word, terrific.

The well-written script is particularly effective as a dynamite thriller yet never seems particularly implausible. Soderbergh has made a history of creating films that wallow in ""uncomfortable"": SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE. TRAFFIC, ERIN BROCKOVICH, AND FULL FRONTAL were all films that looked at the world frankly and seemed at home in the midst of prickly marriage, legal, and other relationship issues. At the heart of so many of his films is the matter of truth and lies, the dynamics of their confrontation, and the aftermath of such collisions.

Soderburgh has often declared that he is giving up the game; he has said the time is soon coming when he will relinquish film-making to the young. After a movie as good as SIDE EFFECTS, one can only hope it's another instance of not being entirely truthful. The man has a ""true"" gift.",1375574400,2,2485,4.961538461538462

5660966,3,B00BNWWVFG,"***1/2

Steven Soderbergh's ""Side Effects"" is like a smooth-running train that suddenly derails halfway to its destination. What starts off as a compelling social drama about depression, the pharmaceutical industry and medical ethics suddenly becomes a Hitchcockian brew of false accusations, deception and retribution. It's not that the second half is bad per se - the movie is compulsively watchable from first minute to last - but one feels cheated by the loss of so much potential and promise.

Rooney Mara plays a young woman whose husband (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison for insider trading. Emily has long been the victim of depression and, when she attempts suicide, she comes under the care of a seemingly ethical psychiatrist (Jude Law) who prescribes an experimental drug for her. After a tragedy brought on by the medication, the two are suddenly plunged into a crisis that could mean jail time for Mara and the loss of both license and practice for Law.

So far so good, as the screenplay by Scott Z. Burns examines the many thorny ethical issues surrounding the over-medicating of patients, the impersonal nature of Big Pharma, the prevalence of medical malpractice and the legal complications that often result when mental illness and prescription drugs are crucial factors in a crime. Burns has created a cast of characters who are believable and empathic, individuals we can clearly identify with because they are caught in a tragedy not necessarily of their own making. But then the writer throws it all away by turning the whole thing into a thriller made up of secret alliances, double and triple crosses, and craftily executed revenge. As stated earlier, Soderbergh pulls it off like a master, but one regrets that the movie turns what could have been an insightful and profound look into a serious social issue into just another melodramatic whodunit.

The acting is excellent throughout, with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ann Dowd rounding out the ensemble.

5660972,3,B00BNWWVFG,"Side Effects is a story within a story. One is about the possible side effects of OTC's (Yes, over the counter has to be included) and in this case Prescription Medications and the other story is about greed, lust and revenge. I loved the premise of this story that involves the side effects of medications that range from itching to death and the possibility of murder.

This story is very well acted by all with Jones (Dr. Seibert) and Law (Dr. Banks) taking their roles to heart and their co stars preforming equally well. The direction and the story is where this movie takes a hit by allowing the typical Hollyweird junk in to spoil this story somewhat.

I will try to be careful and not spoil to much if any of the story by detailing the rediculous actions that the director/writer allowed to take place. I know they do some of these stupid things so the can keep the stars in the spotlight and or directly involved in the story, but come on lets try and get somewhat real!  Dr. Banks has a ethical and moral conflict with his patient Emily (Rooney Mara) that has caused him so much trouble and yet he is still treating her?  Dr. Banks does some pretty crazy things that shall we just say are a little OTT (over the top) and not very well planned or thought out for his problems. The DA's actions and reactions to Dr. Banks initial meeting about his findings involving Emily's case was not quite believable considering what he did. The DA just wanted to forget about everything and let to case run its course. WTH?

The story was not as well thought through as it should have been and instead of a really intelligent and thought provoking thriller with an extremly talented and attractive cast we have a good thriller with an extremly talented and attractive cast.

I'm not sure if the clues were given to us to let us know that something was up with Emily or if they were just oversites. Two really stuck out and smacked me in the nose. One was when Emily was at work and the other was a cop. I am not saying what happens or how it happens just what to look for. There are others, but these really stuck out. For me it would have been much better not getting any clues whether intended or not.

The story does have a few twists, but they just don't live up to a Hitchock type thriller/mystery moment or movie for that matter. I think everyone will enjoy the ending to this a little better than average movie with its talented cast.

I will give this a 3.5 star rating for the acting and an ok story that had a lot of promise, but suffered from some strange SIDE EFFECTS1

I would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes but my husband wanted to see it to the end. I am not a fan of Jude Law but his character, to me, was the worst of all, uninteresting and boring.  Next disappointment was Catherine Zeta Jones. I think she is talented but wondered after watching if she still wants to be an actress. In addition, you see very little of her in the movie. Rooney Mara to me was the biggest disappointment. The word that comes to mind that fits everyone's performance is flat. I admit this movie could have been something if it wasn't slapped together with little focus on character development.  Movie probably had bad direction. The story line was the best thing about the movie. The best scene played was the one near the end between Ms Jones and Mara. Now here is where you saw some genuine emotions!

5660986,4,B00BNWWVFG,"One way or another, this film will not turn out as you expect. I give SIDE EFFECTS four stars because it's absolutely gripping, well-acted, and well-filmed with lots of nice, subtle complications. Despite certain structural flaws, this is one of the few films I'd like to watch again in the near future. The loaded dialogue--e.g., ""Depression is the inability to construct a future""--is meaningful to the ultimate theme of the film. Some sex and violence, but it's tasteful regarding what it shows and does not show. SIDE EFFECTS is NOT just all about wacky prescription drugs and should have much appeal to crime thriller/suspense fans.

Some people obviously like the big twists toward the end, but some obviously don't, and I'm more in the latter category. SIDE EFFECTS departs a little too abruptly from its original premise and storyline. Many of the turnabouts are tacked on too neatly and executed too easily. Rooney Mara does a fine job of playing troubled Emily Taylor, but the same sudden shift her character makes with all the other elements of the film renders her motivations a little hard to understand. Still, the very lack of predictability creates a riveting ride. While a bit sensational and not exactly complimentary, SIDE EFFECTS is also very illuminating of the medical profession and pharmaceutical industry. I do not see anything inherently misogynistic about the film-in-general, but I can see why many women might take exception to how it unravels.",1374883200,,1473,5.086776859504132

It seems, however, that all of them have side effects (hence the title); one of them being to  reduce Amy into a trance-like state where she does not remember what she is doing.  During one of these periods she inadvertently murders her husband Martin (Channing Tatum).  Sent to a psychiatric hospital for observation, she continues to be treated by Banks.  As the action folds, however, so Banks becomes more and more suspicious; all is not what it seems in Amy's case.  No one believes him: in the end he suffers unexpected side-effects, both personally and professionally.  However he uncovers a plot involving Amy and her former shrink Dr. Siebert (Catherine Zeta Jones).  Director Steven Soderbergh builds up the tension through skillful camerawork, lighting and a taut script to create a dnouement full of unexpected twists and turns.  The New York settings conspire to create an oppressive environment that only serve to exacerbate the potential side-effects of Amy's and Banks's actions.

I'll start off by saying I really enjoyed the way it was shot. It's Soderbergh's style but I especially enjoyed it in this movie and how a lot of aspects seemed ""soft"" visually. Jude Law is very much the key player in this film. Mara is also superb as the most, let's say, surprising character. I do love to see her smile (which she doesn't tend to do often in her movies). Tatum is likable as always. Twist after twist after twist. Even as the good-guy, bad-drug dynamic changed to good-guy/bad-guy, I was always rooting for Mara. Zeta Jones is also flawless as the vulnerable divorcee. Quite a good thriller.

An interesting point is made when so many characters in the movie suggest Mara's character go on a certain medication or when people talk about the medication they used to be on. Are we really that commonly medicated as a society? Pop pills to solve all our problems? For example, when Law's character gives his wife a pill to calm her anxiety before a job interview. Hmm.

Interesting to compare these everyday dynamics to real life.

Also - not to give anything away - I like how the first and last scenes bookend.

Shame if this is truly Soderbergh's last feature film.",1374105600,,1191,4.572769953051643

Director: Steven Soderbergh
Writer: Scott Z. Burns
Stars: Rooney Mara, Channing Tatum, Jude Law

I like the movie, but I was disappointed in how slow it moved in the beginning.  It was well into the movie before I understood the plot, and it was hard to keep my interest up to that point.  If I hadn't read good reviews I might have bailed on it.  That said, when I realized what was truly going on I was very interested and glued to my seat. A young wife is depressed over her husband being in prison for years and even on his return home she must see a doctor for her condition.  The doctor has her try a new medication on the market but she doesn't respond well at and becomes despondent.  What follows takes several twists and turns of what is reality.  Well worth seeing, but you will need to be patient until about halfway into the movie.  Glad I saw it, but I don't think I will buy it.

Having said that, as is evident in this movie, there are still those MDs that continue to follow in the devil's footsteps for the love of money. To summarize, I was glad to see the portrayal of patient malice and exposing the deviant ways they employ to obtain monetary ""benefit"" (i.e. greed).

5661106,5,B00BNWWVFG,"4.5 stars

I knew nothing of this ahead of time, and the first half made it seem like a very well-made look at what a bunch of pill-popping zombies we are turning into. Lots of sweet (really more sour) little shots at the evil pharma companies and their total disregard for everything but money. But then things go sideways and suddenly get even more interesting.

Jude carries this film easily, though Mara is also very good. Law is slowly becoming a more and more skilled actor, full of nuance and understated moments that say a lot while showing little. And may I just compliment him on not wearing a wig or getting fake hair? He looks more like the love child of Phil Collins and Sting every film, and hats off to him for keeping the hats and wigs off and aging like a real person, not a Hollyweird joker-faced freak like so many of those phonies are becoming. His sense of honesty informs his role here and as he shifts into gear as it rolls along you really start loving what he's doing and connecting with his nrain.

Add to that a solid script from Burns and very nicely measured direction and editing and composition from Soderberg and you've got a relatively quiet movie that says a bunch while never having to scream its messages, as some of SS's earlier films do. He says he's retiring, but he'll be baaaack. He's too good at this game, and too willing to tell truths our society needs to face up to, to not resume his mastery of the cinematic arts.

The blu-ray is a good transfer, and though the extras are barely ten minutes, the three minute making of is a very sarcastic send-up of how good stars have it on set. The fake ads for Ablexa are also all too accurate, especially the interactive quiz where every yes answer leads to Law telling you how this lovely drug will solve all your issues. While as usual the side effects roll by in small print. Oh, you know, nausea and dizziness and suicide, just the normal things.

In decades to come, if we get smart enough to start trusting nature over big-money-run science again, Side Effects will be seen as a very wry and chilling look at how easily we have let ourselves be turned into zombies by people whose only interest is profit. Oh, and social control, of course. That's where the really big money is.

Perhaps Soderberg will come back with a film that mentions how most of the school shootings have been done by kids on anti-depressants. Not that there's any connection with doping up children every day for years and them becoming insane, mind you. We couldn't say that without any lawsuits now, could we? Let's just say that it's a potential side effect.

I think this movie had to be turned into a thriller to get made by a studio, but what Soderberg really wants to say is, WAKE UP! We're all uncomfortably numb these days, and the pills ain't helping most of us. They're only making it worse.

After watching the movie I did look at other reviews to see what the reason was for only a mediocre rating. Many comments towards the lag or slowness in the movie caused reviewers to turn it off and I agree it tends to be slow moving in the beginning however it becomes more intellectually stimulating as the movie progresses and is worth the wait.

From the cast I would expect nothing less then a great performance. Rooney, Tatum, Law, etc., lived up to my expectations and created a movie that I could immerse myself in, wanting to know what was next, and having the urge to work through the characters lives as a detective on a case.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy working through the plot as it unravels.",1371772800,3,967,4.514285714285714

5661170,4,B00BNWWVFG,"This review contains no specific descriptions of plot events. I saw this in the theater so my review will not include an analysis of the Bluray/DVD technical aspects- the picture quality or sound quality. This review is only an ""IMO"" review of the theatrical film itself. Coming from Soderbergh, who's stuff is usually different from most mainstream cinema, ""Side effects"" was about what I expected, but more twisted. There's always something in his films that pique my interest. ""Side effects"" drew me in and then had me going from being into it to not being into it at various points. I found the film was engaging in spite of some inconsistencies. I also liked Rooney Mara in this, very good performance. Coming from Soderbergh, the use of digital photography, amber hues, and an image that sometimes looks a little pasty on screen was no surprise either.
As ""Side effects"" moves along, the plot goes a bit haywire. I still think it's a movie that is well worthwhile, but it feels more like Soderbergh's political statement on the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street/insider trading, which is fine by me, but the audience side of the equation could have been better judged. The basic idea itself is not so absurd, but is certainly carried over the top. I don't know, maybe he wants that question to be asked, how sensationalist is this? Severe drug side effects, to include bizarre behavior have been documented, and is anyone going to prove there is no unethical money made on what Wall street, the government, doctor's, and drug companies do lol. Maybe there's a deeper irony at work here. The films main weakness is the plot trips up in technical details- which Soderbergh usually pays more attention to. The plot discrepancies reduce the impact of the film as it morphs between its pharmaceutical side effect theme and its insider trading theme. It sometimes comes across as farcical- but it is no more absurd than what we see in the real world- The railroading of drugs onto the market, enthusiastic dispensal by doctors, the astronomical profits of drug companies; and the money wall street, and people on Capitol hill get on insider trading.
""Side effects"" is on the extreme side, is deliberately paced (which anyone familiar with a lot of his stuff won't be surprised at) and try's to cover too much ground as it draws to its conclusion. The acceleration of events- from the slow start to the final act might leave some viewers a little confused. I still liked it better than many other recent offerings. As ""Psychological Thrillers"" go, this one will keep you entertained and get you thinking. I liked the concept of ""side effects"", and it has the crazy ending of a thriller. It was one of those movies that doesn't quite reach its full potential, and ends up being 3 or 4 stars instead of 5. I give it 3.5 stars. I'd Recommend to people who like a cerebral thriller, and to fans of Rooney Mara.
Update: I've since gotten the bluray version of this movie- and found both the sound and picture of the bluray transfer to be very good. Versus how I remember the film looking in the theater, things seem faithful to the color palette of Soderbergh, and everything is a little cleaner and clearer, so maybe they used some ""DNR"" in producing the bluray, but it is nothing unqualified, and in this case actually improves over what I saw in the theater.",1371600000,2,3361,4.747008547008547

Film is pure Hollywood claptrap for the clueless, the dumb, the blamers, and the intellectually lazy. It just talks on and on while this totally crazy woman just wanders around in a fog- thinking about throwing herself in front of a train.  Stinks.

In the meantime he continues to produce high standard medium budget films such
as this latest one.
To fully enjoy the film, one must not know anything about this film prior to watching it.
It is a Hitchcockian mystery with a relevant subject matter.
Steven Soderbergh directed with a seasoned hand based on a well-written script.
Rooney Mara gave another impressive performance as the ""heroine"" in distress.
She was ably supported by Jude Law who gave one of his recent best performances.
This film is about drugs, psychoanalysis, deceit, murder and revenge.

5661207,3,B00BNWWVFG,"we open with a woman whose husband is released from prison following a four year imprisonment due to insider trading. they lost everything with his conviction.  he emerges from prison with pie in the sky plans with others he met in prison with similar convictions.  his wife reacts by returning to acute episodes of depression, a disease she has been treated for in the past. this is a movie which looks like a civil action, malpractice and product liability over a depression drug she takes.  however, it takes a sharp veer into criminal law instead. as the criminal part builds, the film loses all credibility with reality.

the rest are SPOILERS

the HUGE problem is that soderbergh seems to have gotten no legal input on his script, either to the law itself or as to how attorneys think and behave. contrary to his film, mental patients confined to hospitals have detailed and exhaustive civil liberties which must be observed.  they have the right to an attorney of their choice who can challenge her confinement and/or course of treatment. it is a judge who oversees the whole matter, not a doctor. if the judge is told by these conspirators that the patient was really sane, was guilty of murder and should be kept in the mental hospital as punishment, the conpirators' plan, the judge will order the patient released. this is because double jeopardy attached and she has met the terms of release, she is sane. the judge will next order all of the conspirators investigated. eventually they will all lose their licenses and also be prosecuted.

also prosecutors and defense attorneys are not shocked over the prosecutors discovering they made a bad plea deal or the defense attorneys discovering that they got a guilty person either off or with a good deal. they do this every day! they certainly do not enter into criminal conspiracies to right these wrongs! they are advocates.  they do not CARE about the reality of individual cases. prosecutors care about advancing their careers so as to be the lead prosecutor and then ever higher political office.  criminal defense attorneys are concerned about winning as many cases as possible to advance their careers. both also loathe psychiatrists so would never pick one as a criminal co-conspirator.

don't the people who make these films do any research?  i liked it until half way through when they started mangling american law beyond recognition.

Just watched it on a plane, and the intensity of certain sequences left me a bit traumatized, and I didn't really know where the movie was going. Then it became a very clever crime drama, which was unexpected, but incredibly well integrated into the plot.

My wife and I watched it at home and ended up cheering, which is something we do not normally do for movie characters.

This movie is not what you think, but it will not disappoint.

I'm going to find what the critics said about this film, so I can know what critics I should be following.

Jude Law is MASTERFUL!",1370822400,2,363,4.142857142857143
5661220,3,B00BNWWVFG,"Mara is very convincing as a depressed wife of Tatum, who destroyed their wealthy lifestyle and caused her miscarriage after  his arrest for insider trading.  After his release from a four year prison term, he returns to a suicidal and drug-addled wife.  Law enters as her psychiatrist trying to find the right chemical cocktail to fix what ails her.  Nothing works and he consults with Zeta-Jones, her former psychiatrist, who is not particularly empathetic or helpful. Suddenly Mara, in a sleepwalking fog-a side effect of her latest drug, Ablixa-stabs and kills Tatum.  She gets off the murder charge on an insanity plea due to the drug and has to do a stint in a psych ward, where she begins to improve dramatically.  Law's professional and personal life go to hell as he is blamed for prescribing it. He detects  discrepancies in Mara's statements and behavior, however, and begins to smell a rat.  As he works to exonerate himself, he must step outside legal and professional boundaries and , in doing so, appears somewhat unhinged himself.

This film could have been so much better.  The plot is interesting and fairly intricate enough to draw you in.  I think the casting was the issue.  First, if you are a Tatum fan, he has nothing to do here.  He barely appears and is dead early on. A little more development of Mara and Tatums's relationship might have been helpful. There is a flashback that attempts to do this but it is not fleshed out.  Rooney Mara is excellent at developing her character from severely depressed to calculating.  Jude Law does a good job of keeping you on the fence about just who he is.  Is he a good guy?  Is he a competent doctor or a little careless and money-grabbing? Perhaps he is just a little attracted to Rooney, the desperate little bird?  It bothered me that Law and his wife had no chemistry and she walked at the first bump in the road.  However, Zeta-Jones was the real problem for me.  She was so brittle and so plastic from the beginning, not to mention more gorgeous than any doctor you've ever seen, it was a ""tell""....like a clue in a card game.  I suspected her immediately and therefore saw early on where the plot was going.  If her character had been played as an earth mother type who had great insight,  concern, and caring for her former patient, the plot twists would have been less exposed.  I think the goal in this plot is to keep you thinking Law's character is flawed on several levels, and believing Mara's character is a victim of the medical community.  Zeta-Jones waves a big red flag that says ""hey, I'm in on the plot twist"".  Finally, the trap Law sets for Mara is satisfying but the ending itself seemed emotionally vacant.",1370736000,8,2699,4.629473684210526

5661223,3,B00BNWWVFG,"In the beginning, Steven Soderbergh's alleged swan song SIDE EFFECTS is an expose of medical ethics and pharmaceutical abuse.  However, it mutates into a quirky murder mystery that employs lots of twists and deceptions.  Further plot nuances would involve spoilers that other reviews have  already done so, so I'll just discuss my feelings on the film's impact.
I enjoyed the movie overall---it held my interest and the acting is competent if unremarkable.  I'm not a huge fan of Jude Law but he comes across convincingly.  Rooney Mara who came on so strong in GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO seems like an upper scale Katie Holmes.  Catherine Zeta Jones who always looks good is somewhat miscast as Mara's first shrink and Channing Tatum has little to do as the hapless murder victim.
Soderbergh's penchant for sharp characterization is diminished by tepid pacing and unexpected predictability.  SIDE EFFECTS is an okay but unmemorable experience.",1370736000,,944,5.171052631578948

5661226,2,B00BNWWVFG,This is another convoluted story trying to top those that have come before. I found it slow and ultimately pointless.

The entire cast both main and supporting did absolutely wonderful no questions asked. Rooney Mara was so convincing as Emily that it would be ridiculous to ever call her a bad actress; she nails it in Side Effects. I do not like spoiling movies for those who have not seen it (as many of you already know), so i will simply sum up Side Effects in a series of descriptive words: nail-bitting, thrilling, suspensful,  and very eye opening. Even better, nothing is predictable in the movie; you will have to keep guessing what is going to happen next. It is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen that holds that movie genre. Sure enough, Side Effects is definitely worth watching.
Side Effects is just a good movie; one that probably will not win any awards, but is a good movie nonetheless. I am really glad to have this blu ray in my collection. I give Side Effects

5661244,3,B00BNWWVFG,"So, you have great actors and  a great premise- what can go wrong?

Apparently many movies are like this, and yes, things can and do go wrong.

Some movies are totally ruined, and in the case of this movie, while not totally ruined, it is just a shadow of what it could have been.

With more effort involved in the way the storyline unfolds, making an airtight plot and throwing in more character development, this could have been a very interesting, edgy thriller and a movie with far better reviews.

 Instead you watch notable actors play their parts and then, as the credits roll in the end, you can't help but think"" This had the ability to be a great movie- what a shame.'

I hate giving away plots and this is hard to give details on without somehow spoiling the movie.

All I will say is not everything is what it seems and that is probably the one thing that makes this movie watchable- you are left right up until the end, hanging in the balance, unsure of what will  happen next.

Plot loopholes and unanswered questions in general, that will occur to most viewers, will be noticeable for sure by those who like to analyze a movie and  think about what parts did and did not make sense.

But as I said, the over all premise of *nothing is quite what it seems* and the twists and turns the movie offers as it unfolds, is the movie's saving grace.

In the end he uses psychiatry as a weapon against his patient in order to achieve revenge. It's inauthentic and boring.

The film also comments on the materialism of upwardly mobile New Yorkers. However, the social commentary disappears towards the end in a plot about an individualized scandal, as opposed to larger social themes.

5661333,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

I had some high hopes going into Side Effects. Judging from the trailers this looked like it was going to be an intense psychological thriller that had you sitting on the edge of your seat, and for the first 30-40 minutes that's exactly what you're given. However, this film's climax arrives too early which makes the rest of the film fall flat. Side Effects starts as a psychological thriller, but soon turns into yet another movie about money and it was honestly a little disheartening.

The film follows a severely depressed woman by the name of Emily Taylor (Rooney Mara). Her husband Martin (Channing Tatum) has just been released from prison after being arrested four years ago for insider trading. For him this is his chance to start fresh and try to get the two of them back to where they were all those years ago. However, this proves to be more difficult than expected as Emily's depression is slowing down any progress he's trying to make.

After a suicide attempt in a parking garage, Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) is assigned as her psychiatrist. In an effort to help control her depression he prescribes a series of SSRI anti-depressants, but none of them have any positive results. After consulting with Emily's old psychiatrist Victoria (Catherine Zeta-Jones) he decides to try a new drug called Ablixa. The drug appears to have some positive results with the only side effect being that she begins sleepwalking.

Now this is the first half hour in a nut shell, minus the hard details. If the film would have continued down this path I probably would have loved it, but ten minutes later it switches up completely into something it doesn't need to be. The only positive outcome from this sharp change in direction is that it always keeps you guessing. You never know what's going to happen next or what secrets Jonathan is going to uncover and that's enough to keep you watching. With that said, even though it keeps you guessing none of what you find out is terribly interesting.

What really drives this movie forward is the script. The script is extremely well written, even if I don't agree with the direction, and it keeps you on your toes. In a movie like this the script can make or break a film if it's predictable and, luckily, Side Effects if far from predictable. You're probably asking yourself ""Well what's the big twist and why is it so terrible?"" Unfortunately I can't really go into that. It's difficult to explain the change in direction without giving away the big, and unnecessary, plot twist. It's one of those films where if you know what's going to happen then there's no real point in watching it anymore (similar to Butterfly on a Wheel, a fantastic film by the way).

The cast mainly consists of four main characters and a group of minor characters. The four main gunners are Mara, Law, Zeta-Jones, and Tatum. Objectively each of these actors gave outstanding performances. Mara in particular did a phenomenal job. Previously I've only seen her in The Social Network, but her role here is an entirely different animal. It's very raw and even chilling at times. Just a fantastic performance from start to finish. In addition to the four leads you get performances from Vinessa Shaw, Ann Dowd, Polly Draper, David Costabile, and Mamie Gummer. No one really gave a terrible performance, but most of the minor characters only received a couple of minutes of screen time.

Finally, the musical score in Side Effects is phenomenal. Throughout the movie you'll get to here the lovely sounds of Thomas Newman, who's composed for many films including The Shawshank Redemption, Cinderalla Man, and Brothers. Along with the script, the music in this film really does a great job of grabbing your attention. It's big and grand when it needs to be, but it's also quiet and somber at just the right moments. Thomas Newman is just a fantastic composer who always seems to deliver so I'm not really surprised by how much I loved the score.

Overall Score: 7/10 - Side Effects isn't really what I expected, or necessarily wanted, but it would be wrong to deny that it is enjoyable from start to finish. It takes an unexpected turn that I personally wouldn't have OK'd if I was working on the film, but there's not much you can do about it now. If you're looking for a film that's going to keep you guessing then look no further, just don't expect to be blown away by what you're given.",1369872000,,4456,4.725868725868726

The settings are bleak and colorless, the movement in the film is slow and stagnant. These traits may have been the intent, or part of Soderberg's vision, but it didn't make for very engaging visual storytelling. The story itself is timely, I expected a slicker, more time relevant version of Erin Brockovich with Jude Law as the reluctant hero but instead, got a slow paced albeit interesting storyline that had me falling asleep at random moments and missing pivotal information (apparently.) I watched it twice, dragging out the second viewing to smaller bites in hopes I wouldn't miss the details, and in fact there were many I had missed.

Very original approach, unlike anything I recall seeing. The plot takes a dramatic shift mid-way through, and keeps you guessing for the next 20-30 minutes. Even after the big pieces have come together - and the story has crystallized -  there are a few little twists that should keep you interested until the very end.

The attending psychiatrist(Jude Law) at the ER asks to see her at his office.  After some perfunctory questions he writes her a prescription for a new anti-depressant and sends her on her way.  Moments later we see him at lunch with colleagues where the tab is being picked up by a pharmaceutical saleslady whose company is marketing the drug that Law's character prescribed.  I'm thinking great this movie is going to be an indictment of the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry.  Wrong! It turns into one of those thrillers where nothing and nobody is what they seem.  In a word, trash.  Sure the film as helmed by master director Steven Soderbergh has a certain ominous feel to it and the performances are pretty good notably Law's.

5661430,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Soderbergh turns in a solid psychological drama, both figuratively and literally. The setup: a psychiatrist named Banks, played by Jude Law, treats a woman, Emily, (played by Rooney Mara) for depression after she attempts suicide by crashing her car. She has other problems, too, including her husband's recent release from prison for insider trading. Of course, anti-depressants are prescribed and Emily tries a few different ones before settling on a new one that does the trick. Or does it? In a matter of months, her husband is killed and she's to blame, although she blames her actions on a sleepwalking side effect of the anti-depressant. Now things really crank up with the re-appearance of Emily's former psychiatrist (Katherine Zeta-Jones) who has some skeletons in her closet, too. Simultaneously, Banks' professional life disintegrates as he's blamed for mis-treating his patient and a number of other dubious professional acts. And just when you think it's over, it's not over in the best possible way. It wraps up almost too perfectly, but in a very satisfying way. Great performance by Jude Law; Zeta-jones could have done a little less misty-voice impressions, but still very good. What I liked most about this movie was the initial look at psychiatry as pill-pushing then a double back on those assertions, showing how people abuse the best and worst of the business. This movie has some moments that make you stop and think, which is a pleasure. Enjoy it more than once.",1369526400,2,1487,5.073469387755102
5661431,3,B00BNWWVFG,"So, the first half of the movie is about Emily's (Rooney Mara) depression, from which she's been suffering four hard years, since her formerly wealthy husband Martin (Channing Tatum) was sent to prison for insider trading.  Initially, when still able to maintain her ritzy lifestyle in Greenwich, CT, Emily saw Dr. Seibert (Catherin Zeta-Jones) to help her through the tough times.  But then times got really tough and she had to move back to NYC to find work; without health insurance, continuing to see Dr. Seibert wasn't an option.  The movie begins when Martin gets out of prison, and he and Emily must ""reintegrate"" back to some sort of life together.  Daunted, Emily purposely drives her car into the wall of a parking garage, which results in an encounter at the ER with one Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who becomes her personal psychiatrist and begins prescribing a long list of meds to counteract her depression, including a new one called Ablixa.

There's a lot of time spent establishing Emily's state of mind, and a lot of talk about antidepressants and their side-effects.  The Big Bad Pharma Industry gets the type of representation you'd expect.  Emily becomes desperate in her desire to end her life, but knows enough to reach out for help when she needs it and grows overly attached to Dr. Banks, who has a wife and stepson.  The way the dispension of prescriptions is handled can be cliche -- we see the TV ads, doctors are involved in shilling for the drug companies, every woman Emily encounters is on an antidepressant -- which in of itself isn't bad.  However, this time was supposed to be used to set the scene, as it were.  Instead, the movie seems to go off on a tangent, providing commentary about society's/doctors' use of pychotropic meds.  The set-up just goes on too long.

Then there's a murder, which is hinted at in the movie's opening shots with images of a bloody floor.  But after that there's a flashback and yada, yada, yada -- it's like an hour later.  Once the murder finally takes place, we're treated to a much different movie.  It actually becomes a thriller.  Except at this point it's not too difficult to figure out what's behind the events that have transpired.  The only thing left to wonder at is how the resolution will unfold, and I don't want to give that away or there's little point in watching.  I will say, reviewers have compared the plot to Hitchcock...I couldn't stop thinking how much it resembles ""Basic Instinct.""  And yes, the subject matter is mature so keep the kids out of the room while you're watching.

There are some aspects of the movie that are hard to swallow -- ""contrived"" is an apt description.  But it's a well-made movie with excellent acting from Jude Law.  To me, this was by far Law's show.  Channing Tatum isn't a major player.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the victim of poor writing.  And Rooney Mara is great, but her character is never engaging. Dr. Banks is the one with whom we become involved, as he struggles to get himself out of the mess in which his doctoring -- past and present -- has put him.

The reason I think I didn't enjoy the movie more is that it really seems like two different movies -- the first half should have been a quarter, not a half.  And again, there were too many times where the plotting just felt forced.  It's definitely worth watching if you like thrillers; just be prepared for things to be a little slow getting out of the gate. I generally enjoy Steven Soderbergh's work (for those who don't know, he directed ""Side Effects), but am basing my review of the movie on its own merits.  I wanted more thrilling, and less expositioning.",1369526400,3,3650,4.650546021840873

5661433,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Steven Soderbergh has retired (probably) and SIDE EFFECTS is his swan song. It is a fine psychological thriller with as major statement about the pharmaceutical industry and the rather nonchalant some physicians are dispensing drugs today - drugs that have many potential side effects as the seemingly endless commercials on television advertising drone on. Take Soderbergh's skill as a director, Scott Z. Burns' screenplay, and a dandy group of very fine actors and the result is a film that not only entertains but challenges the viewer's ability to keep all the twists and turns straight.

Martin Taylor (Channing Tatum) is released form prison on an insider trader fiasco and returns to his young wife Emily (Rooney Mara) who in Martin's absence has had a miscarriage and rather severe bouts of depression and suicide attempts. She is under the care of psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law) having a history of being under the care of Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Dr. Banks prescribes a new anti-depressant Ablixa (the only drug mentioned that is a pentagram instead of a real drug) and among the side effects are somnolence and somnambulism, and while on the drug Emily kills Martin. With Emily plea-bargained into mental hospital confinement and Dr. Banks' practice crumbling around him, the case seems closed. However, Dr. Banks cannot accept full responsibility and investigates to clear his name. What follows is a dark quest that threatens to tear what's left of his life apart even as he discovers the diabolical truth of this tragedy. The story steps into the territory of adultery of a novel sort, lesbianism, casual general drug use/abuse by nearly every character in the story, and forensic medicine as manipulated through psychiatrists' minds.

In addition to the main characters, each of whom delivers superb acting, there are some fine contributions by the minor characters as played by Polly Draper, David Costabile, Mamie Gummer, and Ann Dowd. This is a clever story with many at times confusing elements but stay with the action and the thoughts and the piece becomes a well-oiled thriller.

5661455,4,B00BNWWVFG,"After 'Contagion' especially, I wanted to see SIDE EFFECTS for not just the cast but for director Steven Soderbergh. While this one is probably closer to 3-1/2 stars than four, it's still well-made and pretty engrossing, story-wise.

The story seems simple enough - a young woman (Rooney Mara), suffering from depression after her husband (Channing Tatum) is released from several years in jail for insider trading, tries to commit suicide by smashing her car. A psychiatrist (Jude Law) she meets in the hospital ER becomes her therapist, eventually prescribing an experimental drug for her that results in side effects leading to a horrible tragedy.

Initially you think this is the crux of the film - the controversy of how easily we (both patients and healthcare officials) will take any pill we think will cure all - but as with any Soderbergh film not everything (or everyONE) is what/who they seem, and the film evolves into a thriller with enough twists to make a pretzel maker happy (and the film worth seeing).

While I loved the story, script and actors - and, ultimately, the film - at the same time I just felt the performances were (intentionally?) a little sterile, keeping me from getting emotionally close to any of the main characters (to some degree intentional, I think, but saying anything more would come to close to a spoiler).

5661458,5,B00BNWWVFG,"Watch out for spoilers - best thing to say about this one is that it's a delicious noir thriller/mystery and, as others have commented, very reminiscent of Hitchcock. I gave it a 5 for being so very elegantly what it is - clever, tense, twisty, gripping (after a slightly slow start) and terrifically performed. Hitchcock loved themes around madness and the frightening power of psychiatry - I love this effective and very timely contemporary take on that. Responding to some reviews here I'd argue that plausibility in any nitpicky precise sense isn't a requirement of the genre. Double-turns, escalating spookiness, and intriguing surprises are.

5661461,4,B00BNWWVFG,"From the opening shot--which duplicates the opening camerawork of PSYCHO--SIDE EFFECTS plays out like a by-the-numbers tribute to Alfred Hitchcock.  We have the strong female protagonist and a befuddled but determined male lead; duplicitous supporting characters; and a third-act twist that, if you know your Hitchcock, you can see coming, but is still a nice revelation nonetheless.

The plot is predictably complicated: Emily's (Rooney Mara) husband is finally getting released from jail, where he's been doing time for some white collar crimes (take that, Wall Street!).  When Martin (Channing Tatum) gets out, Emily, instead of being overjoyed, drives her car into a wall.  Chance--or is it?--leads her to psychiatrist Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who gives her a new medicine he's been encouraged to prescribe.  Things get better initially--Emily's sex drive is given a jump start, for one--but then turn very sour very quickly.  (I shan't give away more, although the trailers more or less spoiled certain plot elements.)

Steven Soderbergh has his legions of fans.  Personally, I've never been blown away by his work; he has his good films (OCEAN'S 11, TRAFFIC) and his stinkers (OCEANS 12 and 13).  SIDE EFFECTS is the first of his films I've seen that doesn't really feel like a Soderbergh film, probably because so much emphasis is upon paying Hitchcock his due homage.  The plot rolls along at a decent pace, and there's a nice change of focus about halfway through, where the film shifts from Mara's shoulders to Law's.  Both actors give riveting performances; the same can be said of the supporting cast, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones as Emily's past psychiatrist.  (Yes, even Tatum continues this career upswing he's been on, proving that he's actually a good actor, and not just eye candy for the ladies.)  The script is solid; none of the twists are really mind-blowing, as perhaps they're meant to be, but the dialogue is decent, upheld by the caliber of performances.

If anything, this is SIDE EFFECTS' main weakness: it doesn't have much to offer on its own.  Sure, the acting is solid, and there's some nice social commentary (about twenty years too late, but what the heck), but the film is basically a reworking of the basic Hitchcock tropes.  So basically, if you know your film history, you might not be able to get too far into this one.  However, if you're a determined Soderbergh fan (the man's been over-hyped, but there's no denying he has talent), or if you are unfamiliar with the Master of Suspense, you my find something new in SIDE EFFECTS.

Genius work of swapping roles between antagonist/protagonist as well as an honest approach to these roles in psyco-pharma and insider trading.

5661467,5,B00BNWWVFG,"Movie deserves 5 stars time two, if possible. Why? Let me explain.

The Insider - Russell Crowe had a fit of anger & throws a ash tray at a hotel employees, hmm the Tobacco  lobbyist are everywhere including movies in a subliminal way, they simply don't want the truth about smoking cigarettes kills 443,000 Americans every year.

Red Corner - Richard Gere & Bai Ling. Both excellent acting careers, I suppose they both annoyed China's PLA strong arm of their PR division. They ""outed Richard Richard Gere for being different."" His reply was so what, I'll travel to Tibet & joined the ""Free Tibet movement"" I'm sure the PLA wasn't expecting his ""try me"" along w/ the one two punch of China's persecution of Tibetan monks & Dalia Lama....Bai Ling? Knowing visit Shandong Province in China, watched her like a hawk to the point she had urges to shop lift 15 bucks worth from a store?

Lord of War - Nicholas Cage received the amnesty International award for the acting role of  a dramatized yet true to life gun runner. The NRA, had their ""scope"" on him.... appeared to be indifferent to his cause & had tipped the LAPD for arguing w/ his wife & was charged for ""public drunkenness"" Suppose the NRA didn't like his donation of $2 million to provide shelters, medical and psychological rehabilitation for child soldiers in ruined countries.

Side Effects - Jude Law plays a role precisely as a Psychiatrist when his practice is to counsel and prescribe medications only to find he was merely a pawn taking the money to have trial runs on medication the FDA never approved, but played the role of exposing the dangerous game of exposing the pharmaceutical Industry. I'm sure he has made enemies in the pharma industry. I hope the FDA tightens their grip on the pharma industry, this movie is very close to reality.

This movie doesn't deserve 5 stars but 10 because it's all about drugs & derivatives.",1368316800,2,1897,4.695783132530121

5661469,4,B00BNWWVFG,"I must applaud the many good reviewers that are articulate in their written reviews.
And I quote..Steven Soderbergh's 'Side Effects', first appears as if it's designed as a critique of psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately, it becomes more like a Hitchcock thriller. It's a film that keeps your interest but you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit, to appreciate it.[...]

The key players are Rooney Mara and Jude Law with  support from Catherine Zeta-Jones and Channing Tatum. Tatum must have been used for star power as he adds  little in his role. Nice work if you can get it. Zeta-Jones plays a cool icy psychiatrist. Not much depth here.
All the actors do a good job with Rooney Mara being the most interesting of the players.
All in all a good thriller that holds your interest.
A good RENTAL.",1368057600,2,826,4.802816901408451
5661470,3,B00BNWWVFG,"I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it. However, I'd recommend this as a rental, not a purchase film. In every sense this was an enjoyable flick, but its flaws and plot holes will show with repeated viewings.

Catherine Zeta-Jones gives the best performance in the film, followed closely by Jude Law. All the actors are competent and strong performers in their given roles. The first half of the film is very solid. In the second half the writing weakens and it all wraps up far too neatly. The film is most often described as ""Hitchcock"" like - and while it is obvious that that was the film's aim, it falls short of that monumental mark. It's better quality than most of what's being put out right now. It's engaging, entertaining, and it does not in any way insult the viewer's intelligence, but it never reaches the greatness of Hitchcock. Great movie for a rainy afternoon or a relaxing evening home that you won't regret watching, but it's not the kind of film you'll remember years from now.",1366329600,3,1000,4.58659217877095

Steven Soderbergh's latest film ""Side Effects"" is an interesting film which takes a post-modern perspective and blends it together with Hitcockian elements. While a film like this has the potential to come off as cheesy since it tackles pharmaceutical companies and their treatment of mental health, I found the writing to be inspired and it made for a very gripping story. Very nice twists and turns. Overall, everyone gives a very good performance with most praise reserved for Mara, Law and Tatum. Each absolutely kills it in their respective roles.

Should you buy it? Yes. A very good film, detailed and visually enthralling this is the kind of film you want to own so that you can revisit it every once in a while. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1366243200,2,991,4.7894736842105265
5661472,5,B00BNWWVFG,"If you are looking for an update on the film noire - a caper that speaks to contemporary issues and conditions of life - you cannot do better than this film.  Though I will talk of details in the film, I will avoid spoilers.

The film starts off with the image of violence in a home, then cuts to a drama of depression.  A beautiful young woman appears to be fighting for her life, her eyes, her every motion afflicted with existential pain.  Her husband, a crooked financier, is about to leave prison.  She has been waiting for him for 4 years, in a job with supportive boss who understands depression from personal experience.  After an attempt to hurt herself, she goes to see an ambitious young psychiatrist, who seems genuinely concerned and goes the prescription route, which is so commonplace today.  As they run through traditional medications, the psychiatrist finally hits on an experimental one that he happens to be testing as a ""consultant for pay"" to a big pharma company.  For a time it appears to work, then the woman suddenly becomes murderously violent, but perhaps only for a single instance.

As the case reaches the media, the doctor's life falls apart.  Did he make mistakes?  Was he ethically compromised?  Did he have ulterior motives?  Is he going crazy?  Or was he somehow set up?  The process becomes one of investigative backtracking, which in his desperation only the doctor believes may help.  It is a story of an intricate and completely believable journey that in the end reveals that no one involved is who they appeared to be.  In the delightful psychological twists, as only a great thriller can do, the viewer's perceptions of the characters is challenged again and again, with mounting fear and horror.

This is an absolute delight for connoisseurs of the noire genre, a deliciously wicked puzzle of moral ambiguity and revealed evil.  Recommended with enthusiasm.",1365379200,7,1901,4.8478260869565215
5661473,4,B00BNWWVFG,"""Imagine everything you ever wanted shows up one day and calls itself your life and then just when you start to believe in it it's gone and suddenly it gets very hard to imagine a future. That's depression, right."" Emily Taylor (Mara) is depressed. She has gone to a few doctors but nothing seems to help. Finally Dr. Banks (Tatum) prescribes her a pill that seems to do the job, until she murders her husband under the effects of the drug. Convinced that he was right in prescribing it he defends her and tries to help get her life back. Then he makes a discovery that changes everything. This is a movie where I had one expectation and ended up with something completely different. I thought this was going to be a suspense almost horror movie from the preview. What I got was more of a drama, but also much better then I expected. This is another movie that kept me guessing what was going on the entire movie and so engrossed that by the time it was over I almost wanted to watch it again. The ending is so satisfying that it really made the movie better. I highly recommend this movie. It's the kind you can watch a few times and catch something different each time. Overall, different but much better then expected. I really liked this. I give it an A-.",1364947200,,1259,4.384615384615385
5661474,4,B00BNWWVFG,"SIDE EFFECTS is a tough movie to review, because any description of the movie that's of any value tends to be a spoiler.  Heck, that sentence alone is a bit of a spoiler.  So I'll apologize in advance if I appear to give less information than I should about the film.  I'm assuming you haven't heard too much about it, and might enjoy discovering the film on its own.

Director Steven Soderbergh has made a slow-burning movie here.  It never really moves at a fast pace, but it maintains a pretty high level of intensity throughout.  It is a film that deals pretty directly with how Americans are perhaps a very over-medicated society, particularly when it comes to anti-depressants.  And how we don't always know about all the ""side effects"" (hence the name of the film).  But to his credit, he's pretty non-preachy about it.  Some of the things people do in this film while under these drugs are pretty scary...but it's all presented in a non-alarmist way.  It acknowledges that these drugs have a place in our society as well.

There are four star performances here.  Least successful is Catherine Zeta-Jones as a psychiatrist who may have some nefarious motives.  Her part is a bit unrealistic and feels more like a caricature.  Channing Tatum is more successful as a Wall Street trader just getting out of prison for some insider trading, and looking to readjust to life on the outside and to find his new place in the world.  Tatum doesn't LOOK like a typical ""wall street tycoon"" that one might see in film (he's no Michael Douglas or even Charlie Sheen)...but he brings nice touches to the domestic side of his life in his scenes with Rooney Mara, who plays his deeply troubled wife.  This is Mara's film to win or lose, and she does a nice job.  The temptation in a role like hers would be overact...but Soderbergh is interested in having his team UNDERPLAY things.  He's got a compelling story to tell and there's plenty of suspense to be had.  But he's playing it more like a `70s political thriller than a `00s potboiler...and the film is all the more admirable for that.  And Mara gets her tone just right.

As does Jude Law as her psychiatrist.  He's every bit her equal, and he gives us a nuanced character that we root for and root against at varying turns.  He can be either genuinely ingratiating or repulsive.  Law has always been a terrific actor, but never QUITE made it to real stardom.  It would appear as he moves into the ""middle age"" of his career, he's going to give some really solid character turns (his recent work in ANNA KARININA is another example...he stole that film).  Yes, he's fun in the new SHERLOCK HOLMES franchise...but a lot of actors could have played that part.  But when he's called upon to give a real, rounded performance, he delivers the goods.

Some may find the pacing of SIDE EFFECTS to be just a little too deliberate.  As I implied, it is a slow-burning affair.  But it has genuine excitement and surprise, a mostly intelligent script (the Zeta-Jones character being the exception), very competent direction and some very nice performances.  It's certainly for an adult audience with a decent attention span.  But if offers many rewards and is very much recommended.",1364774400,3,3220,4.674377224199288
5661475,5,B00BNWWVFG,Don't miss this fine film. Great performances from everyone: from Jude Law to the cameo of Peter Friedman. The screenplay is suspenseful and full of surprises. And as always Steven Soderburgh directs with class and integrity. They just don't make 'em like this anymore!!,1364688000,14,270,5.159090909090909
5661476,4,B00BNWWVFG,"Viewers of this film will either like it or not like it depending mainly on how they relate to Rooney Mara's interpretation and depiction of her character Emily Taylor, a woman who struggles with depression and anxiety after the release of her husband from prison.  I personally found Mara very seductive and sympathetic in her role, and that's why I found this film so compelling to watch even as the plot twists into the absurd.

For those who are slightly turned off by Rooney Mara (probably a lot of women) then this is a film that's hard to cling onto.  Channing Tatum is a non-entity in the film, and Jude Law has lost much of his easy looks and charisma.  And if viewers don't like Rooney Mara then they certainly won't like Catherine Zeta-Jones at all.

Some viewers may be annoyed by how the film is a superficial ultra-Hollywood film masquerading as a thought piece.  The plot leaves much to be desired, but I personally came away from the film thinking that Rooney Mara will one day become as dominant an actress as Natalie Portman is today.",1364515200,3,1052,4.598930481283422
5661477,5,B00BNWWVFG,"If this is Soderbergh's last film he has certainly not disappointed. Both in his film technique, his canvas of acting talent,his straddling of genres and in his subject matter,he displays a mesmerizing thriller set in the ominous,mysterious world of Big Pharma where drugs feed the right to happiness(many with scary side effects),with a screenplay by Scot Burns,who refers to films like Fatal Attraction and Jagged Edge. Soderbergh uses panache,dexterity and pacing in a world of psycho-sexual ambiguity. Rooney Mara's troubled patient Emily Is at the centre of a web of pharmaceutical/psychiatric machinations,she takes her Psychiatrist Dr Jonathan Banks'(Jude Law) prescribed anti-depressants after a deliberate head-on smash following her husband's release from prison. Dr Banks serves as a ""consultant"" to a large pharmaceutical company and he is experimenting with the new Ablixa medication. Mara plays her part with inscrutable,dark mysteriousness. There are no foundations to the effects of the drug or the character of Emily. Emily sleep walks and still appears suicidal. Mara is phenomenal. Jonathan seeks counsel from Victoria Siebert(Zeta-Jones),Emily's former therapist,who seems to know more than she is willing to reveal.

The vulnerability upon which our expectations of Mara are built are soon switched by Soderbergh/Burns's genre-morphing. As with medication we don't know what the long-term effects of each character's moral ambiguity will be. In the next part of the film Dr Banks becomes the central part of the film. Thrown into scandal when his patient is involved in a tragic accident after taking Ablixa. He slowly unravels as his decisions come back to haunt him,and he has to cross several moral boundaries to get his life back on track in a wrong man procedural(aka Hitchcock).His frustrations expertly played by Jude Law. However everything is never what it seems. At times there is a slippery quality and slickness to the proceedings as there are fakers and bigger fakers,a world of double crosses and blackmail where we ourselves are manipulated. Then tricksy mechanics and narrative pirouettes in an impeccable craft makes the story's centre of gravity elusive,its not the story itself but the way it is presented that grabs us. Despite formal rigour,the human element and emotional empathy is squeezed out. This is a spectacular,intricate and thrilling journey with great performances,forward momentum and abundant surprises with frequent close-ups and the shift in and out of focus of a master. If he retires the landscape will be duller.",1364256000,2,2572,5.478589420654912

Hot Toasty Rag, December 12, 2017

Steven Soderbergh, the director who specializes in unsettling movies, adds another fitting film to his collection with the heavy drama Side Effects. Theres a very specific group of people who shouldnt watch this movie, lest they be scarred forever: Channing Tatum fans. Yes, youll be tempted to watch every movie hes ever made, and youll be excited to see him show off his acting chops in a drama, but trust me. I love him just as much as you do, and Im terribly sorry I watched this movie.

Rooney Mara is the luckiest lady alive but doesnt know it. Shes married to Channing Tatum, but for reasons unknown to her or the audience, shes enormously depressed. Shes unhappy in her life, cant enjoy herself in bed, and is suicidal. Whats a girl to domaybe try therapy? Well, her psychiatrist Jude Law doesnt know what to do with her either, so he prescribes some unapproved pills. They just might have some pretty nasty side effects.

Im not a Rooney Mara fan, and this film did nothing to raise my opinion of her. I don't think shes a very good actress, and her character in this film is so despicable, I doubt if Ill ever see her in another light. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays another psychiatrist, but she isn't very convincing in all the aspects of her character. Donning glasses and a bun doesnt necessarily make someone look smarter.

Side Effects is extremely upsetting to watch, unless you dislike Channing Tatum, in which case you probably have bad taste and stand a chance at enjoying this movie. I saw this film with my brother, a Steven Soderbergh fan because of Traffic, and he didn't even like it. From a mans point of view, he also found it unsettling because of Rooney Maras character.",1513036800,,1753,4.645161290322581
