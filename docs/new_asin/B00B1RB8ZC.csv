5552415,5,B00B1RB8ZC,It was the best anime i have ever watch and now i get to own it on dvd and blu-ray this is a must have,1367280000,2,102,3.12
5552416,5,B00B1RB8ZC,let me start out by saying I can not wait for this release on April 30th and already have my copy on pre-order. I am a big fan of both the manga and the anime. I can still remember going to my local book store and picking up the first vol. when it was first released in America and loving it. To this date it has always been one of my favorite anime's. I have always wanted to own the dvd's of the series but have felt that 12 episodes for 30 dollars i feel i wasn't getting my moneys worth but now were getting the first 24 episodes which cover's the Macao arc the Daybreak arc the lullaby arc the Galuna Island arc and starts the Phantom Lord arc I would say that now i feel i'am getting my moneys worth.,1366416000,58,706,3.9788732394366195

5552422,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"Ah, Fairy Tail. Where do I begin? Well, the beginning, I suppose. I first started getting into Fairy Tail 4 years ago (which is when I bought this), when I was still in high school, at the recommendation of a good friend of mine. Little did I know how much it was going to end up meaning to me later on. I mean, sure, there are other anime series that have helped me a lot in life, and even helped shape me into the person that I am. But, I think it's pretty safe to say that, out of all of them, Fairy Tail has had the greatest effect on me, over any other. Now, I know that there are plenty of people who hate and judge this series for being too cliche, or whatever, but that's just because they don't believe in the wonders that can actually be learned from a wonderful series like this. For example, more than anything, Fairy Tail helped me realize just how important my friends are, and now I truly consider them the most important people in my life. And so, anytime now that I'm feeling down, I just think of not only Fairy Tail, but my friends as well, and I know that their light will always guide me through the darkness, no matter how bad things may seem. Needless to say, as cheesy and/or corny as it may sound. I definitely believe in the power of friendship, more than anything else, in fact. So, thank you, my friends, and thank you, of course, Fairy Tail. I really don't know where I'd be without you. That is all.",1512432000,,1429,4.2

5552442,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"Fairy Tail is the best anime/show I've ever watched. Period.

What is Fairy Tail? It's a magical guild that takes on jobs, solving most of them through either over the top action or tons of humor (and quite a bit of both!) and somehow always finds itself in the middle of gigantic, potentially cataclysmic events.

Every character has a personality that draws you in and makes you root for them. Interactions between characters (especially Happy, the flying, talking cat, and Natsu/Lucy) will have you ROLFing for hours. It's not all fun and games, although it's mostly a lighthearted series. There are a few times that'll make you tear up a bit. The series sticks mainly to certain anime tropes we've had in other series (transformations a la DBZ), but I've never seen them done so well, especially for so many episodes. Personal note - I watched the series subtitled as the Japanese voice actors are hilarious (especially Happy's voice), so I'd recommend it subbed.

If you're looking for a new anime addiction, this series is it. It has the humor, the cast, the action, and will draw you in!",1482796800,,1094,4.777777777777778

5552446,5,B00B1RB8ZC,Fairy Tail starts off a little slow but as it goes on it becomes a great show to watch with the action/battles and the story and plot is great. It has a great Japanese and English voice cast of actors. It has a good character development and a great diverse of different characters with different abilities and different kind of guilds. It is a great series to watch I recommend this to anyone who would want to see something different or want to give a chance to another series that they have not seen.,1475366400,2,503,4.361702127659575

5552453,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"Recently I purchased this product for myself and my mother.  She's become a fan of anime like me. We were thrilled when the Fairy Tale Collection One Bluray+ DVD combo pack came, along with our Zootopia and Ride Along 2 movies.  If you're new to anime, a fan of Naruto, or just looking for a good anime to watch. Then Fairy Tale is the anime for you.  It's like Naruto minus the ninjas and ninjutsu. This anime is set in a world where magic is used for every day things and combat.  Natsu is the main protagonist who's a powerful wizard, that was raised by a fire dragon. He excells in fire magic and uses it in close quarters combat to perform amazing feats. He's goofy like Naruto and has a rival named Grey. A ice wizard who's just as powerful as him, but has a issue keeping his clothes on haha. They're members of a famous guild with powerful wizards called ""Fairy Tale"". Together with Lucy, a Celestial Wizard who makes contracts with celestial spirits. She summons them to fight with her in battle. Using magical keys called ""Gate Keys "". Plus Erza a girl who's a wicked strong wizard, who uses her magic to summon magical weapons and magical armor for combat. Kinda like how TenTen from Naruto can summon ninja tools using a transportation technique. Natsu,Grey, Lucy, Erza, and Happy the cat. Natsu's talking blue buddy that has Angel wings and uses aero magic. They go on epic action packed  journeys filled with lots of laughs. This box set has 24 episodes and does end on a cliffhanger. As someone else mentioned in a review I saw.

So if this is a anime you've been wanting to see for along time. Then purchase this collection and collection 2 together. I would've but I really wanted to see the two movies I mentioned too. My mom and I have a new favorite anime now. She really enjoyed it as much as me. We ended up binge watching the whole thing in a couple of days. It was just so good. A great story and likeable characters too. I liked Natsu right off the bat. Grey became another instant favorite. He's just so cool, no pun intended lol.  Anyway this box set is totally worth buying.  Watch it in English or Japanese with English sub titles. Either way it's very entertaining. You won't regret purchasing this item. The anime is addicting that's for sure.",1467590400,3,2274,4.462650602409639
5552454,4,B00B1RB8ZC,"Positives:
So I import DVD to Australia mainly because finding anime in a stores is next to impossible. So to my surprise the DVD's worked with out me spoofing my DVD region on my PC. One of the things that is not listed is that the DVD's appear to be multi region - 1,2 and 4 (unfortunately all NTSC so PAL restricted devices won't play them). I was quite surprised that I wouldn't need to change/spoof my DVD region on my PC to play them. VLC is also region free as long as the DVD drive you have is not region locked in the firmware.
The BR disks are also only listed as A1 but the box says A1 and B2. Haven't tested the BR's yet to verify - my new BR drive is still on order from Umart.
The 4 DVD disks have nice imagery printed on them (different on each disk).

Negatives:
-As far as delivery goes - arrived 3 days early but case is cracked along the spine  (same with collection 3) which is disappointing. We can blame Australia Post and back packaging for that.
-The 4 BRs are all printed with the same image. The only way to tell them apart is by a small red number and tiny (hard to read serif text) text that displays what episodes are on the disks.
-On The DVD's all the episodes are part of the same video track so skipping the out/intro is a pain in the ass because points on the timeline are tiny.
-The card slip cover was also slightly torn.",1466553600,2,1357,4.1169811320754715

5552491,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"Fairy Tail is one of those few,rare Animes that ends up being amazing. The Dub version is amazing,even for a Anime. The Storyline,Animation,Soundtrack,Characters,and Action is great. For a lover of Animes,but this one. It's worth watching.

Fairy Tail starts of as a young girl named Lucy Heartfilla wants to join Fairy Tail,a magical guild with powerful wizards. She meets Natsu,a young fire Dragon slayer wizard,and hist best friend,a cat named Happy. Lucy becomes friends with them and joins Fairy Tail. There,powerful wizards like Gray Fullbuster,Erza Scarlett,and Mira(don't know last name). Well,and Magavage. The guilds master. Lucy becomes a Celestial wizard,and joins Fairy Tails strongest team. She helps her friends fight dark guilds,evil wizards,and thugs,across the country.

One thing I like about this anime. It's very interesting. From Lucy getting kidnapped,to Gray betraying Fairy Tail,for the guilds main characters getting stuck on a island for years,to Loxus returning,this is one awesome show with plot twists. Plus,it's really funny. I love how much Erza is crazy about food,and she always eats cakes,and gets mad at the boys fighting,it's funny. Happy always gets Lucy made and gets beatin,and Natsu always gets motion sickness. Even when there's a serious fight,stupid,funny things happen.

With over 200 episode,enjoy Fairy Tail. The Dub is good,and so is the Sub.(well,I really don't watch it in Sub). It's still a great anime. Characters 8/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Storyline 10.5/10 Action 9/10 Humor 9.5/10. Overall,10.5/10. This is a amazing anime. Watch it if you love fansty animes.",1438732800,3,1608,5.528455284552845

5552495,5,B00B1RB8ZC,A must have for the anime fan of Fairytail series. There are few things that my teenagers agree with me on. Anime shows like this are one of them. Definitely a kids show unlike so much anime these days. But we enjoy it. There is some bad jokes (bad meaning stupid) but it makes it fun and we can laugh at that more than the joke itself sometimes.,1435968000,,346,4.102941176470588

5552497,5,B00B1RB8ZC,Fairy tail is an anime that can be enjoyed by almost everyone. It's light hearted and fun to watch. Occasionally there is an episode that's a side splitter such as the one where the characters switch bodies.,1434412800,,207,4.621621621621622
5552498,2,B00B1RB8ZC,"My 3/10 mangaupdates review for the whole series as of this writing. The anime is identical with a high among of filler.: I tried the series once when it was new, judged it as an attempt to rip off One Piece and moved on but i picked up our volumes on a slow day at my library job because i heard some crazy things on the web and flipped through the series again. What i saw was unoriginality to the max, tasteless ecchi (with a scene of sexualized torture standing out), no real stakes or world logic and borderline plagiarism. Is Kodansha trying to troll Shueisha here as i saw Franky and the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. So the only difference to One Piece is that the Fairy Tail constantly throws it's female leads under the bus, lacks any tone and now managed to rack up about 10 (!?!) spin-offs. Two points off and zero interest on my side remains. Read the recent Blind Faith Descent (9/10) for a good and rather dark adventure series with a comparable setting or SJ's stuff. They at least have a proven formula.",1433721600,2,1014,4.398936170212766
5552499,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"Great series, very fun and imaginative. Excellent for adults and kids to watch together. It is not over-sexualized and while the fight scenes can be intense, the show emphases the value of friendship and loyalty.

5552591,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"I have been watching anime since I first saw ASTRO BOY in 1969. My current favorites are NARUTO, BLEACH (sad to see it end), ONE PIECE (started amazing, but has been declining), KILL LA KILL, and ATTACK ON TITAN. I have read all the FAIRY TAIL manga up to volume 27 and plan to keep reading until I am caught up.

So there's my background. What do I think of FAIRY TAIL? The quality of art is not the best, the plot meanders in fits and starts, and I really don't think that much of the main character Natsu. So why do I love it? The art style fits the whimsy of the plot. The plot meanders, but in a way I enjoy, filled with constant surprises that entertain. And while Natsu is the main character, it really is about Lucy, the cipher of the series, through which we discover the silly magic world of Fairy Tail.

Many series get serious, then give you comic relief, or are funny and then give you bits of serious drama. FAIRY TAIL never ever bogs down with serious moments long. Even the big finale with the death flute in the first big arc ends with whimsy. It has magic girls (Erza), plenty of fun fan service (Lucy), a hilarious rivalry (Gray and Natsu), a cute blue flying cat (Happy), and tons of crazy weird bad guy characters. While this show did feel like a rip off of ONE PIECE's style and tone at first, it has gone above and beyond its early influences. ONE PIECE bogs down in crazy long fights that are not always very entertaining and long arcs that just take forever. FAIRY TAIL works better because it's not afraid to turn its gaze from some of the main characters and tell a story with some of them. Then when they all go on an adventure, they all feel integral to the story without slowing it down.

My favorite bit from this set? When Happy gets kidnapped and the kidnappers put him on a stick to cook him...he starts to tremble...they think he is afraid...he says, no, he needs to pee and if he does it would probably make him taste funny, so they probably shouldn't eat him. Silly, funny, whimsical, with characters that stand out each in their own fun adventurous way.

By the way the blu-ray does make this series more crisp and colorful. I put DVD up against blu-ray and was amazed how much the blu-ray format improves the quality of what is really a simple anime style.",1388102400,,2295,4.330232558139535
5552592,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"If you haven't seen this I suggest you get it (either pre order the english version here or get used to reading subtitles). It's like watching a mythic multicultural hodge podge, at least that's how I feel when I watch it.

For me the begining of the series made me un easy but once I got to the last 4 episodes of season one I was glad to see the series maturing into the addictive freindsship series it is today^_^. I really enjoy this series and bought collection 2 together on a whim and can wait for collection 3 of the series!. Anyways for those new to the series just bear through the first 8 episodes and you'll absolutely love the series from then on:) Great value I'm just giving it 4 stars cuz the start is so rocky.,1380672000,13,570,4.098214285714286

5552600,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"Fairy Tail is an absolutely amazing anime that you just have to see!  Collection one includes the first 24 episodes of the series.  Fairy Tail follows the story of the members of the Fairy Tail Wizard's guild as they perform magical jobs and form teams with each other to get jobs done.  The viewer's window into the guild is Lucy.  Lucy is a brand new member, and you learn things as she does, from how guilds work to learning about the other guild members.  Throughout the collection Lucy makes friends with her fellow guild members.  Lucy, Natsu, Gray, Erza and Happy are just starting out as a team, they have done a couple of jobs together and are working out the kinks in their team.  Poor Lucy has her hands full with Natsu, Gray and Erza on her team, they tend to go overboard and cause a lot of damage to the villlages they are working in.

The anime is well done with a bright and colorful art style.  The English voice cast did a great job dubbing this but the Japanese audio is included for those that prefer that version.  The discs have nice art printed on them featuring guild members. There are extras on each disc.  I personally love this series, the only downside to this collection is the cliffhanger it ends on!

If you enjoy fantasy, magic and more than a little mayhem then you should really check out this series!",1380240000,47,1336,4.430327868852459

5552602,1,B00B1RB8ZC,"I bought this because I wanted some high definition anime.  This Blu-ray is upscaled from a SD source and is not natively HD.

I bought this looking to expland my Blu-ray HD collection.  Blu-ray upscaled SD to ""HD"" is useless to me since I already have a DVD player that upscales to 1080p resolution.

Its not completely worthless considering they don't have the DVD collection (just the combo), but when I buy a Blu-ray I expect native HD.  I consider this a bait and switch.  They baited with native HD anime and gave me SD anime upscaled into 1080p.",1378944000,5,552,4.525252525252525

I am not all the way through the set but I have moments where I enjoy it, and moments when I am bored. Also, with almost any other show I have watched I was hooked after the first few episodes. Here, not so much. I find Lucy to be annoying and the joke about Grey losing his clothing...well it feels kind of pointless.

5552615,5,B00B1RB8ZC,I am a very big fan of fantasy and sci-fi based anime's and Fairy Tail fits the bill perfectly. With the usual naming of their attacks and the cliche characters it instantly comfortable. But what makes it truly amazing is the difference in the way the characters are introduced and the telling of their stories and problems. In a lot of ways it is like One Piece but with a different goal and twisting story plot that goes down to a deep level. I say this is a must buy and I'm waiting for the second collection to be released.,1373328000,3,527,4.28

5552617,4,B00B1RB8ZC,"this is a standard battle shonen anime (fighting anime geared towards male teens). its very similar to dbz,naruto, ETC. FT takes place in a world full of wizards(to clarify wizards isn't the most accurate title as they are as close to wizards as naruto ninjas are to real ninjas) who use magic for many different things. wizards can join guilds. guild members can accept quests for reward money. FT is about 4 members of the guild ""fairy tail"",natsu(uses fire magic),lucy(summons creatures/beings to fight),and erza(uses armor magics and fights similary to a knight). theres also happy, natsu's pet cat the is blue and can talk and fly. so from what ive told you so far it seems the show is about the team of 5 going on quests. and it kind of is. but like most shonen anime it will stray from its concept a bit and you will meet other guilds.the fights involve the 'wizards' battling with magic. each character uses 1 style of magic and its common for 2 characters to have the same style. FT is pretty easy to start watching and doesnt throw all the different characters and such instantly. however FT has some flaws. for one alot of the episodes at the start of the series are episodic. that means they aren't story arcs. so if you like long and fleshed out story arcs with many cool characters and fights you may not find that in FT sometimes. this makes the pacing feel weird. characters like FT guild members appear of thin air and theres really no prior buildup for these characters. while it may not sound like a big deal you will notice it! also on an emotional level FT just hasn't been there! im many episodes in and haven't gotten sad about anything! when i watch one piece i practically cry at the end of choppers backstory or the many depressing naruto backstories! FT tries to fldo that but things move too fast. i want more time to soak in things and really get to know the group! in all FT is a solid anime but the pacing just isn't right at times and alot of the concepts and character designs are generic. if you are someone waiting for the next episode of one piece or naruto you may find this a nice distraction or if your someone trying to get into action packed anime i reccomend this as a great start but then moving on to a bigger anime like one piece (a true masterpiece of an anime!)",1372982400,5,2308,4.432941176470588

8561065,5,B00B1RB8ZC,"Normally, when an anime has episodes numbering in the triple digits, I tend to be a little hesitant. After all, that is quite a time commitment, and those shows tend to have a lot of filler episodes (anime-only material) that are often less well-made than the core material. Fairy Tail is an exception to those rules. With an excellent dub cast and great artwork, even the goofier episodes work. The core cast (Natsu, Gray, Lucy, Erza, and Happy) are so much fun to watch regardless of what they're up to.

Where this set really shines though is in the Galuna Island and Phantom Lord arcs. Besides providing an array of creative magical battles, they also provide crucial development for two main characters, Gray and Lucy respectively. Heck, even one of the two anime-original episodes (Natsu and the Dragon Egg) provides a touching backstory for how Natsu and Happy met as well as the Strauss siblings. To say any more would spoil things.

As for complaints, they are few and far between. The most persistent is the use of CGI circles whenever characters are using magic. To me, it looks like a computer loading symbol, so I joke that a character's attack is ""loading"" whenever the circle appears. Additionally, around episode 11, each episode starts with a chibi Natsu telling the viewer not to sit too close to the TV. It's a little creepy and also suggests that this show is aimed at a younger demographic than it is.

Aside from those, this is a great start to a great show. It's a lot of fun and a great mood booster. Everyone needs a show about adventure and friendship. Fairy Tail is mine, and hopefully it can be yours as well.",1530662400,,1637,4.637931034482759

8561072,4,B00B1RB8ZC,"Fairy Tail... Figured I give this show a try.... But ya this show isn't very impressive. Don't get me wrong, the blu ray quality is fantastic with that 5.1 audio too, not being in a stupid 4x3 screen size either since this series isn't that old.

 So we we have these people who are in this amazing strong guild called the fairy tail, filled with the strongest wizards around. I thought they were going to be a group of badasses, turns out most of them are a group of drunks. Fairy Tail tries to have series moments but it throws humor so much that I can't really take this show seriously even on the supposedly sad moments in the show. It's like if in the final fight with naruto and sasuke all they were doing for every 5 minutes is make a joke, it just kills the momentum. It doesn't have any badass serious moments like one piece or naruto than can masterfully handle its slapstick humor masterfully while telling a serious tale. Fairy Tail is like one piece in a way that it doesn't have any proper arks, just small side adventures and on to the next adventure. I guess the only plot going around here is the main characters gradually getting stronger as the series progresses so they can kick more but as they go. The blond chick who joins fairy tail at the start of the series is particularly usless. You think having a title like celestial wizard sounds pretty cool, but turns out her spirits are far from it. She just overall feels like she gets in the way of the actual wizards.

But hey this is only the first collection. I haven even started to get into the meat of the series, or it's movies and OVA's.

I do think it's a buy but at your own risk. People have different tastes in anime and I say if you don't enjoy that typical anime comedy then your probably not going to enjoy it as much as someone who does. Hopefully the rest of the series picks up momentum in it's tone. Less jokes, more action please.",1526601600,,1920,4.310249307479224
