1971114,4,B00014TCQI,"I use this DVD regularly and enjoy its relaxed, but steady pace. The sequences are well structured and build to quite a strenuous finish, especially if you use the extra Advanced sections.",1170720000,,188,4.90625
1971115,5,B00014TCQI,"After having a stroke (18 months ago) my physical therapist recommended doing aerobics.  With her instuctions, I rented about 5-6 DVDs from my library to test them out first to see if they were suitable for my rehab.  This is the only one that measured up to my unique requirements.  I recommed it to anyone who, like me, is trying to regain use of a leg affected by stroke.  The workout is 30 minutes, (there is an option to go longer if you can handle it) but its not too difficult, but challenging enough to help you with footwork and balance and strength.  I can't do arms, so I just focus on the leg movements.",1168300800,,615,4.3130434782608695
1971116,1,B00014TCQI,I agree wholeheartedly with Brother Cadfael's review of this DVD.  They do not keep up with their own music; they do not look professional and I was very disappointed with this DVD.  I would not recommend this DVD to anybody and it should be recalled.,1158883200,,251,4.555555555555555
1971117,1,B00014TCQI,"I just got through doing this workout and I had to go online right away and write this review. I love workout tapes and regularly incorporate them into my fitness program. Some prove to be not for me, largely because of personal preference; I am well aware that they may be suitable and inspirational for others. I honestly can't recommend this DVD to anyone. There are too many problems, including:

1. poor transitions from one step to another and extremely poor cues to let you know what is going to happen ahead of time. I realize that I am not a Rockette, but I want to feel that I am learning a routine as well as mechanically exercising my muscles; otherwise, I would just take a nice walk or ride my exercise bike. Even Cindy, the model, is hard-pressed to keep up with the quick shifts between one step and another. Another big problem for me is that the timing of the music does not ""go"" with the steps being performed for several of the numbers. That makes it very hard to stay in time with the performers. I suspect the music was dubbed over the soundtrack.

2. Lack of concern over common safety issues. For example, when you are doing lunges and squats, there is no mention of protecting your back, nor is there any invitation to use a chair if you are having trouble balancing. And you WILL have trouble balancing, because the tempo is too fast. You will not be able to perform the exercises in a proper form, particularly when you are lunging and kicking over and over. There is also no mention made of proper breathing techniques for these sorts of exercises (i.e. it makes the exercise easier and more effective if you breathe out when you are exerting yourself).

3. uninspiring production values. Yes, this may sound so shallow, but I want to feel like I am part of a cool class when I am working out. The set is stark and cheap (a mat in a gym)and the lighting is often glaring. The camera angles make it harder rather than easier to follow instructions (i.e. you start a new step and what do you get: a focus on the women's upper bodies!). The music is elevator music and, as mentioned above, it doesn't synch in with the exercises being performed.

4. no learning curve. If I invest in an exercise DVD, I want to be able to enjoy working out with it for years. I love tapes that teach me new steps or new ways of moving. (Thank you, Jane Fonda and Petra Kolber, among others!)With this DVD, I figured out what was going on and realized the only challenge to surmount would be ignoring the music and anticipating the poor cueing.

Well, take it for what it's worth. I think this aerobics DVD is far too easy and amateurish for a serious, experienced exerciser, and too slapdash and confusing for someone who is just beginning or resuming a fitness program. I like Leslie Sansone's  and Jane Fonda's tapes for simple, effective, safe aerobics. Petra Kolber has awesome tapes if you are a little bit more advanced and/or like a challange; you will learn to love ""dancey"" aerobics if you give her a try. Don't frustrate yourself with this, please!",1129075200,35,3066,4.495511669658887
1971118,4,B00014TCQI,"This is a good work out for those of us just starting aerobics in our 50s.  It does challenge your coordination, but the good thing is, no one but you has to know.  The main point is to just keep moving whether you are keeping step or not.",1127174400,2,239,3.9583333333333335
1971119,4,B00014TCQI,Realizing that exercise is especially important as I age;  I am glad I purchased this CD.  It is clear and concise and easy to follow.  As my body adjusts to the core exercises I can add the  more advanced movements provided to my routine.  Very good if you are interested in a light/moderate workout.,1123718400,2,301,4.5
1971120,4,B00014TCQI,"Although this DVD says ""keeping fit in your 50s"", it's probably not for people who have been doing something aerobically challenging all along. It seems to have been designed more for people like me: 58 year old who has never done anything more aerobic than walking two fifteen minute miles a day and who developed arthritis in the knees and had to even stop that exercise and has gained 50# as a result.

This DVD exercise routine was challenging for me because of the recent inactivity, the arthritis and because I am uncoordinated and have never been able to dance. Of course, it is made clear that we are to only do as much as we can until we are able to work up to following the exercises just as they are done on the DVD. However, they could have made following the DVD a lot easier if they had kept the camera on the action of the exercise rather than periodically panning the faces of Cindy and her exercise coach. It would have also been helpful for the exercise coach to keep counting through-out the exercise.

Also, if you buy the other two DVDs in the series, don't expect different bonus features. The bonus features are the same. The bonus feature gives tips on keeping motivated and reasons why it is so important to stay active as we age.

Overall, it is a good DVD, but not for everyone. If I had known there was so much dancing-type exercises, I may not have bought it. I'm sure that the dancing was incorporated to make the work-out appear more fun, but if you're uncoordinated like I am, it is only frustrating.

For the person who has not exercised for a while or whose exercises have not been aerobically challenging, who has developed some arthritic aches and pains and who likes to dance, this would be an excellent choice.",1094428800,48,1748,4.487421383647798
1971131,3,B00014TCQI,"The most frustrating thing about this DVD is that the moves are not in time with the music.  This drove me CRAZY!  I actually ended up closing my eyes for a large part of the DVD so I could move in time with the music and not be distracted by the people on the video.  Then I just turned away from the TV for awhile so I couldn't see them. This is not my idea of a great exercise video.  I think if the people were in sync with the music, it would have been much more enjoyable. Some of the moves are different from Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs, which would be a nice change.

The instructor, while she seems to be a nice lady, doesn't do enough talking or explaining. There are many times where there is dead silence (except for the music), and the instructor is just staring at the camera. Many older people have issues with their knees or feet, and she rarely mentions ways to protect them.

Try to rent this from the library before buying to see if you like it.",1396569600,,966,4.166666666666667

1971133,3,B00014TCQI,would like it better if there were more choices. I get bored with exercise. I don't like to repeat the same thing over and over.,1384300800,,128,4.16
1971134,1,B00014TCQI,"Both instructors off tempo with the music and each uses different arms/feet - somewhat confusing. Transitions from step to step not smooth. Camera work somewhat ""angled"" and odd. Once you know the routine it's not a bad workout but not challenging by any means.

1971135,1,B00014TCQI,"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! DO NOT EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS JUNK! Wish I could say something positive, but I am just being truthful!",1368921600,,123,4.391304347826087
1971136,4,B00014TCQI,This is one of the workout videos I purchased for my office to add to our workout dvd collection. Our seasoned employees really like this video.,1367884800,,144,4.576923076923077
1971137,5,B00014TCQI,"My criteria for a good workout video are 1) that I get a good workout and 2) I find the video helps me to exercise regularly.  This video more than meets both criteria.  I own several videos, but this one is used about twice as much as any other, mostly because it makes me smile.  I find myself smiling while I exercise and those smiles continue into the rest of my day.  Because it makes me smile, I actually look foward to the workout and am frustrated if I miss it.  In addition, I want to thank Robyn Stuhr for her excellent advice on how to do squats and lunges.  After using the video at least twice weekly for about three months, I can now do them without pain for the first time in more than 30 years.  Thank you, Robyn!

If you're looking for a mental workout that will keep you thinking ahead for the next move, this isn't for you.  If you want a workout with challenging new moves or that will teach you to dance, this isn't for you.  If you care about super-high-quality cinemetography and leaders who never make a mis-step, this isn't for you.  If you want a solid lower-impact (not no impact) workout with friendly, encouraging people who care that the exercise contributes to long-term health and avoids injury, and that elevates your heart rate and your mood, I would recommend this one to you without hesitation.",1331510400,7,1330,4.432098765432099
1971138,3,B00014TCQI,it's ok.,1241395200,,8,3.5
1971139,2,B00014TCQI,"The good news: This is a relatively easy, relatively low-impact aerobic workout.  If you're recovering from an injury or you're out of shape and haven't worked out in a while, the easy, repetitive workouts here will get you moving.

The bad news: On the whole, this is a terrible workout video.  If you've never done aerobics this is not the video for you.  With the exception of how not to do squats, there is no instruction on how to do any of the exercises here.  There is no discussion of form.  Half the time you can't even see what the instructors are doing, because the camera is focused in a close-up on their faces.

This is probably a good thing.  Many times the two instructors are doing two different things.  If they don't know what they should be doing, how the heck are you supposed to know?

The instruction is terrible.  Sometimes the order to change to the next move comes one, two, or three steps before the change, sometimes during, and sometimes after the change, and sometimes not at all.  And you can't even judge by the music, because many times the steps don't match the beat.

I skipped the second core routine entirely.  I've been doing aerobics for years, yet without instruction, full-body video, or synchronization with the music, I was completely unable to follow this routine.

My advice: if you're experienced with aerobics and need to take it down a few notches because of injury or age, pick up this DVD and listen to the audio, ignoring the video.  It can be a boring but good workout if you need to take it slow.  If you're new to aerobics, skip this one entirely.  I'd hate to see someone try this and quit doing aerobics, thinking they can't do it, when the problem is the video production.",1208908800,5,1729,4.540453074433657
1971140,1,B00014TCQI,"It is not that the movement are not good movements,it is the fact that they are not in time with the music that makes this dvd really hard to follow. I took it from the library, did it once (it nearly drove me crazy) then returned it. Don't waste your money!",1200182400,3,258,4.078431372549019
8006514,2,B00014TCQI,"I recently picked up this DVD (as part of a set) at a used book sale.  I will turn 50 in about 6 months, and I thought this might be a good addition to my fitness DVD collection.  Well, as it turns out, this DVD isn't really geared towards someone like me, who is already an regular exerciser.  In fact, rather than being titled ""keeping fit,"" it should have more appropriately been called ""establishing fitness,"" ""regaining health,"" ""retaining some type of activity""...you get the idea.  On the one hand, the cardio routine on this DVD is offered at a very beginning level, but on the other, it isn't instructed very well, which means that beginners might have trouble following the workout.

This workout is led by Robin Stuhr, an exercise physiologist, assisted by Cindy Joseph, a fitness model.  The DVD is well-chaptered, with the workout menu lists the following options (times added):

1. Introduction [4:42]
2. Body Basics [4:16]
3. Workout Tips [3:19]
4. Warm Up [4:21]
5. Core Routine: Part 1 [6:28]
6. Core Routine: Part 2 [6:16]
7. Core Routine: Part 3 [5:04]
8. Core Routine: Part 4 [4:17]
9. Cool Down [5:12]
10. Advanced Exercises: Part 1 [4:52]
11. Advanced Exercises: Part 2 [5:59]
12. Keeping Fit Fundamentals [8:32]

Other reviews have described Stuhr as ""condescending""--in the lecture sections such as the introduction, she has a way of speaking that comes across like a teacher talking to young children.  This is not true for the workout itself, which has MANY other issues.  First, Stuhr seems completely inexperienced as a fitness instructor.  She is off the beat, uses incorrect names for basic moves (such as grapevine), fails to explain new moves (including an entire Latin dance section with steps like cha-cha and mamba), and provides absolutely HORRENDOUS cueing.  Joseph is clearly NOT a fitness video model--she is pleasant and smiling, but she also looks lost performing the moves, and she and Stuhr are frequently out of step.  Finally, the video has some of the absolute WORST camera angles that I have ever seen in a fitness DVD.  The camera often zoomed in extra close on Stuhr or Joseph, which made it even more difficult to follow the routine.

The unfortunate thing is that the actual exercises included were not bad.  I took some steps to make the routine more challenging for me (i.e., skipped the warm-up, performed the so-called ""advanced"" exercises first, wore my weighted gloves), and I did get a decent short workout.  However, the problems with this DVD were so annoying and distracting that I know I will not use it again.  Someone who is unfamiliar with exercise DVDs might like this video, but that is a shame, as there are SO MANY better offerings available.",1507507200,,2711,4.856521739130435

8006520,4,B00014TCQI,"I am 56 with bi-lateral knee replacements. Have not exercised in years.  This was a perfect video to get up and get started with.  The beginning is a little lengthy, but after that was a good pace, the steps were easy to follow, and had my heart rate up nicely.",1462579200,,261,4.2
8006521,5,B00014TCQI,"I love this dvd. I'm not ashamed to admit that I stopped before the advanced part started and told myself that I'd had enough. I was breathing deeply and felt as though I'd worked out. I'm a diabetic and it brought my glucose down many points. Maybe one of these days I can work up to doing the advanced part also. I'm a year away from turning 70 so the fifties are history for me. The steps were relatively easy for me to follow. I enjoy the interaction between the women. They're very nice, personable ladies. When people complain about the instructors being out of step or not with the beat, I wouldn't know if they were or they weren't! I'm rhythm-challenged. The women said not to worry about getting out of step--""Just keep moving."" I think this is a nice mantra to follow. If you're very musical or a former band member or a great dancer, maybe you'll want some experienced dancers for your workout. But when I'm breathing hard and feeling those endorphins, I couldn't care less about the beat. It's just so good to move. Thanks, ladies!",1451692800,,1044,4.5
8006522,4,B00014TCQI,I use this regularly.  I enjoy that it is low impact and that modifications are shown.  The only improvement I can suggest is if you can select the options in order to play back.,1447027200,,178,4.205882352941177

They are timed right for me, and it's pretty low-key discussions going on (which I prefer to the talky ones), and their instruction on form is good. I'm no longer a perfectionist in my styles of workouts (for those complaining about something or another on these dvds), which is all part of my de-stressing over little things. I agree that un-synced music/moves are CraZy mAkiNg, and that's a deal breaker for me, too, but fortunately, I've never experienced any of that with my 3 dvds.",1407369600,,632,4.552631578947368
