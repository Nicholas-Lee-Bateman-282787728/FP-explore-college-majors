Yes the content is very helpful but. A radical revelation was obtained by me to use in my game that makes it worth watching.

I just watched a recent golf tournament where the commentator (might have been Johnny) comment just how strong VJ is and what great shape he is in.  Such comments have plummeted me off the cliff of rotten golf for 30 years.  Whereas this VHS describes how such powerful swinging (strong - great shape) is a great way to produce a slice when you want it. It is one of the 4 ways Johnny shows how to produce a fade/slice when you want it.

After watching this VHS I now disregard such strong and in shape comments as not worthy of my attention. I do not want to produce the result he describes. Rather I now use about 25% power to produce the shots that are shown in this VHS.  Either I am very strong or those that admire strength (in commentary) are very weak and it doesn't take much to appear strong.

This cause and effect technique to deliberately produce a slice is worth the price of admission. It sure feels weird using 25% power to get the same distance and vastly better control. Johnny specifically describes the powerful down swing as a ""flaw"" that produces a bad result - unless that bad result can be useful as he demonstrates.  The thought that I must exert myself hardly at all is mighty strange but very little effort is paying off.  Counter intuitive, little effert produces results.",1347408000,,1462,4.486792452830189
7929420,5,B000051S6N,"In this video, Miller discusses and demonstrates how to hit a variety of draws, fades, high shots, knockdowns... you name it.  Miller explains the physics of the swing and the resulting ball flight behavior.  Though I've read or viewed dozens of golf instruction books and videos, I've never come across a more lucid explanation and demonstration of shot shaping.  I go back to this video time and again, and can happily attest to now having quite a few of these shots in my bag.  Fun and instructive video.  Highly recommended!",974592000,9,528,4.822222222222222
