I used this DVD almost everyday and followed the guidelines set out in their Skinny Bitch book and my fiance and I both saw results in me after only 1 week!!",1239753600,2,313,4.2

3612609,5,B001GJOL54,I saw this series advertised on the Tyra show and ordered it. I luv the workout and it does really give results if you stick to it!,1237420800,,131,3.888888888888889
3612610,4,B001GJOL54,"The skinny Bitches DVD was what I expected. The ""instructers"" are not professional trainers, but they still work you out.  In the beginning the talking and comments they made were funny, now its a bit annoying so I workout with the volume off. I have to say that I do enjoy the workout.",1236988800,,286,4.39622641509434
3612611,5,B001GJOL54,These two ladies are awesome!  I loved there natural way of presentation and the ability to just go with it.  This might not be the hardest work out but you can pump it up or down according to your physical fitness.  Kudoos to them for all of their creations!,1232496000,,259,4.244897959183674
3612612,5,B001GJOL54,"This is the first at home workout DVD I've purchased since I was younger, but these girls have it going on! GREAT guidance, good explanations and you can tell they love it so much because this is their daily work out. Skinny bitch for life!",1231286400,,240,4.355555555555555
3612613,5,B001GJOL54,"I want to be a skinny bitch!!! I love these girls. SO cute and upbeat - I felt like I was hanging out with my girlfriends throughout the entire work out. They poke fun, laugh and get your in the mood to work out. Both authors lead the work out, each demonstrating the movements at different levels. This is great if you want to amp up your work out once adrenalin kicks in!",1231113600,2,373,4.123287671232877
3612614,4,B001GJOL54,"These are beginner level and not hard-core (they do not use weights), but this is what I needed when I got back into exercising. The set is elegant, the music is pleasant, the moves are flowing and never boring and I felt as though my whole body got a nice stretch. There is not much cueing, but after having done each workout twice now I don't find I need it. The workout was designed by Patrick Goudeau, a recognized fitness pro. What I liked best was the feeling that I was working out with good friends.",1230595200,15,507,4.291666666666667
3612615,1,B001GJOL54,"The arms segment is the only one I've tried so far but it was horrible. I have to say this is the worst workout DVD of the twenty or so I own for a number of reasons:

-The segments are billed as 20 minutes each, but according to my DVD timer, the arms segment only ran 15 minutes.
-The workout was too easy. I didn't sweat, my heart rate didn't rise, and my arms didn't get sore. You don't use any weights.
-The moves were hard to learn and there weren't verbal cues to tell you when to move to your left, right, etc.
-The instructors are amateurish and their ""we're so cool"" banter is extremely annoying. They often missed steps. This seemed more like something someone would post on Youtube than a serious workout video.

Save your money!",1230422400,20,741,4.323741007194244
3612616,4,B001GJOL54,"I purchased this out of curiosity.  I had not heard of the instructors prior to seeing the DVD's come out last week.

There are a couple reasons I say it's not for everyone.

1.  If you find the title offensive there is more of the same language used throughout the video.  You definately wouldn't want children around when watching this.

2.  There is very little focus on queueing and form.  They frequently change the step without any warning and if they do mention the change they are 2 to 3 steps into the sequence before they do. They like to talk a lot about how much it's hurting or how sweaty they are and occasionally promote eating healthy.

There are some positives which is why I gave it a 4, although I'm sure many will disagree with this rating.

1.  From what I gathered neither Rory nor Kim are professional instructors, and if that is true then they did an excellent job for their first time at this.  I've studied to teach group classes and it is a lot harder than it looks.  I give them kudos for even taking this on.

2. All the workouts are done entirely with your own body weight.  No weights or bands required.  This is rare these days, but might be appreciated by someone just getting into working out in their home.

3.  There were a lot of new moves I've never seen and I've been taking classes and working out to DVD's for years.  The workout is choreographed by Patrick Goudeau who is a pro.  Even though the queueing is almost non-existant, the choreography is such that you're always able to see the screen and the moves are simple to pick up.

4.  I have bad knees and typically any kind of all body or leg workouts include a lot of lunges and squats that kill my knees.  There are some lunges and squats in the workout, but they are performed in such a way that I didn't feel any stress on my knees.

5.  Overall the production is not bad.  The music got to be a bit annoying to me a couple times.  For each section they repeat the same beats over and over.  Thankfully it is very faint.  Lighting and camera work are good.  I was always able to see what I was suppose to be doing.

A bit of an overview of each section (by the way, the package says they are 20 minutes each, but it's more like 15):

Abs - very pilates like.  There's a tiny standing warmup then it's all mat. If you can imagine doing pilates without any instruction on correct form, and doing the moves faster that's a good description of the abs section.

Arms - Your arms will get tired.  Think of arms circles for 15 minutes.  There are a lot of variations and some weird boxing like moves that take a bit to catch on to.  There's also some foot movements that don't really sync up well with the arm moves, but they're doable.

Legs - Think Jane Fonda and Pilates combined but again, no focus on form and moving pretty quickly.  These exercises seem more for your glutes than legs.

Glutes - (they use ""A**"" in the DVD) Mainly standing moves; this is where some of the lunges and sqats come into play, but the movements are very fast, like plyometrics.  While not difficult, I found this workout least memorable.

To summarize I would recommend this for someone who has no objection to profanity, is in reasonably good shape (gets exercise walking or in their day to day activities and has no health problems)  and wants to start exercising in their home.  The reason I say no health problems is that there is very little mention of the proper form.  If you're just looking for something to get you moving, want to feel like you're working out casually with a group of girlfriends and are generally laid back you'll like this DVD.

I would not recommend this if you're a serious exerciser looking for a challenging workout... even though they were complaining of sweating, I didn't break a sweat and didn't find this to be a particularly challenging workout.  There are also sections where they don't seem to be working out to the beat of the music which will annoy an experienced exerciser.",1229990400,84,3995,4.40218878248974
3612627,5,B001GJOL54,Love it!! It is a fun video. It is fast paced and still easy to follow along with! The video accommodates all levels and builds!! I recommend it for sure!!,1389830400,,155,4.2
3612628,3,B001GJOL54,"Wasn't very challenging - too much ""bitch'n"" not enough working out.  Not to my liking as a challenge for a good workout.",1368576000,,121,4.5
3612629,5,B001GJOL54,"Out of the three Skinny Bitch dvds that I own, this one is my fave. Simple and fun. Kim and Rory are a hoot and entertain the entire time you work out. Definitely worth the few dollars to shape, tone and bounce your butt into shape.",1363824000,,232,4.065217391304348
3612630,4,B001GJOL54,"First off, I really liked the workout video. I completed the workout about two hours ago and I am already feeling my muscles getting sore as if I did this yesterday. It is fun too. It is slightly cheesy, so beware if you don't like that. What I didn't like about it is that they went way too quickly with the moves. Once I was finally getting a hang of some of the more complex reps, they were starting to move on to something entirely different. That was definitely irritating. I wasn't too big a fan of the arms section, though. I did not ""feel the burn"". I feel like you really need a set of hand weights to sculpt your arms. The rest of the workouts really did a lot for me though. My legs were burning, my abs were burning, my glutes were burning...It was great! To be honest, I had to take breaks in between a lot of the exercises. Again, the arms workouts didn't do much for me.

To sum up...

Pros: Fun workouts, they really work your legs, thighs, butt, and abs. They are also motivating.
Cons: They went too fast, didn't take time to explain the exercises, and they really just said you'll catch on eventually. The arms workout didn't do much for me.

Next time, I'll do my own arms workouts with hand weights, not their silly punching bag awkward arm flailing.",1363478400,,1271,4.309623430962343
3612631,5,B001GJOL54,"This is one of the best workout dvd's I own. It has four different workouts (abs, arms, legs & butt), plus a meditation tutorial. Each workout is about 20 minutes long, and they are relatively easy, and you choose which one you would like to do, or you have the option of doing all four in one shot. The ab workout is simple, but you feel it afterwards; especially the next day. But you do not get super-sore from any of them, just enough to let you remember that you did exercise.
The two ladies on the dvd say things you will not hear on the average workout dvd. They keep it very real.",1362614400,,588,4.166666666666667
3612632,2,B001GJOL54,It was lame. I have to write more words or I can't submit this. I didn't like it at all.,1362355200,,88,3.45
3612633,5,B001GJOL54,"When I was preparing for my wedding, I wanted to make sure I was in great shape for the big day. Already an avid runner and very much into yoga, I was looking for something extra to really kick it up a notch. Skinny Bitch Body was it!!! I started doing 2 of the 15 minute sessions 5 days a week, alternating abs and arms with legs and butt about 4 months before the wedding and when it came time to walk down the aisle, I was in the best shape of my life! I was also more than ready to hit the beach on my honeymoon! My best friend is now preparing for her own big day, so I ordered this video on Amazon for her and I can't wait to see her own results! Definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to kick themselves up a notch! Stick with it and you'll see the results! You'll also get a major confidence boost when you master every move in the arms segment! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!",1361404800,,892,4.01685393258427
3612634,1,B001GJOL54,"Awful workout. Not a bit challenging, not even for the beginner exerciser. Very silly ladies and perfectly ineffective workout.
Trust me, stay away and try the many other workout possibilities.",1346025600,,193,5.466666666666667
3612635,5,B001GJOL54,This is by far my favorite workout video and I think the best of the Skinny Bitch series.  The girls are funny and I like that they mess up every once in awhile.  I'm not an athletic person but I'm in pretty decent shape and in my late twenties.  Everyone of the sections is challenging enough to feel and notice your body working but not so hard that I find myself skipping or having to modify the moves. Each 20 min workout focuses on a part of the body so you can do one a day or all of them or like me switch off two a day depending on how much time you have.  The arm workout is the absolute best I've done that didn't require weights.  Actually none of the workouts require special equipment tho you could easily add weights if you wanted (I don't think you need to though),1345075200,2,779,4.098684210526316
3612636,2,B001GJOL54,"The workout sets on this DVD go too fast for most people that aren't already experienced in exercise routines. Even if you were, the steps are not explained slowly enough so you end up having to watch the DVD a decent amount of times to try to 'pick up' on what the instructors are doing. It doesn't seem like they know what they're doing, honestly, because both myself and my mother were injured after failed attempts of trying to keep up with them. This will probably work out for someone who picks things up quickly and already knows proper exercise protocol so they don't hurt themselves. But it seems like they are missing their mark with their target audience- which is amateurs- when they are not treating the audience as if they are new to fitness training.",1329091200,,765,4.591240875912408
3612647,1,B001GJOL54,"It is amazing to me that these two clowns even have an exercise DVD; they have to be the laughing stock of the exercise world.  I only picked up this DVD b/c my neighborhood bookstore went bust and it was 1/2 price (I'm even mad I paid that much).  I thought I'd be able to do the arm segment daily ..... it's a mess!  Why would you want to work your arms without weights?  It's plain to see they made their own arm exercises with no choreography and they're not even on tempo with the music.  They don't even explain the segment; all of a sudden, there's arms flying in every direction.  Their banter is even nauseating.  If these two can put together an exercise video, so can I.  This one ended up in the trash!",1328745600,,714,4.198529411764706
3612648,1,B001GJOL54,"My review is very harsh, but it is my opinion so here goes:

I bought this video because I was looking for a different workout than all the others. What I found was offensive and didn't actually end up being a work out. The reason this video offended me is simple. The 'instructors' declared at the beginning of the video that it doesn't matter if you are ugly as long as you love your body. If I were leading a work out the last thing I would do is call the people paying me ugly or fat. They also appeared to be under the influence and had no idea what they were talking about. I would be terrified to let these ladies near anyone who is trying to learn about real physical fitness.

So yeah. If you like watching two drunk chicks casually messing around with stretching or hand weights, then this is for you. If you are looking for something that will teach you something as well as make you sweat, look elsewhere.",1328659200,3,917,4.264367816091954
3612649,4,B001GJOL54,"I like the workout. No- it is not the hardest workout, no they do not cue like professionals and no they are out of step sometimes, but I still like it! This is a good mat-based body-area focussed workout. It is fun and different too. It has four segments: Abs, Legs, Arms, and Butt. each segment is about 20 minutes and it works the body out nicely for a light toning day! I also have Bootcamp-that one is a good low/med impact circut style workout with some light toning intermixed. I have not tried Booty Bounce yet. To bump up BODY- use light handweights for the Arms and Abs segments!",1305849600,,589,4.363636363636363
3612650,4,B001GJOL54,"The workout is good, I can't really say it's the best, but it works for me. For all those who say thay did not break a sweat, maybe you did not try hard enough. You definetely have to use your own strength based on your fitness level, the more you push the more you sweat. I have tried tons of exercise DVD's and I have to say I like this one, it does make me sweat. Yes, the instructors are not always coordinated, and sometimes they make mistakes...but that's exaclty what they promote, imperfection is part of everyone's life. So stop bitching and get moving!!!",1305849600,,564,4.380952380952381
3612651,5,B001GJOL54,"I LOOOOVE skinny bitch total body dvd. it gives amazing results and is easy to do. it really works all muscle groups and provides a lean toned body. that being said, its not really difficult to do but you will feel the results and toning immediately and more and more each time. YOU WILL GET AMAZING RESULTS WITH THIS!! think lean ballet body! results i havan't achieved with any other fitnuess regimen!! I actually turn the volume down and put it on my portable tv and watch tv while im doing it. the ""instructors"" ( rory and the blonde chick)  can be really really really annoying after awhile. sometimes reminding me a bit of paris hilton with the whole bitches talk and talking about being sweaty bitches..etc...thats why i turn the volume down! also they're not really instructors and it shows! they don't give very clear instructions and sometimes do it wrong themselves but after you've done it a few times you'll know what to do and you can turn the sound WAYYYY down like i do so you don't have to listen to them! so i ignore the fact that they are really annoying bc i turn it down anyways and focus on the benefits which is amazing results. if you do the video 3-4 a week mix in one day of cardio and you will have a fantastic smokn hot yoga/pilates/ballet dancer body!!!! this is def worth it! buy it for yourself, your sisters, your mom, your girlfriends..awesome find!! (i got better results with this then the tony horton (10 min trainer, P90x systems...etc) because its easy to do and kinda fun the routine is fun and you can see your muscles being sculpted with each workout..the more times you do it the more you will want to do it more because the results from each session are visible and defined :) hope that helps!!!",1299542400,2,1738,4.482649842271293
3612652,3,B001GJOL54,"Three stars is pushing it. I saw this a couple years ago on the shelf, knowing I needed to kick myself back into shape. The name is what caught my eye, so I thought it wouldn't be bad. They do some really strange workouts I've never even heard of or seen, and to this day they make me feel awkward even though no one else is around. It's a good workout for those starting out or good for a few sessions for those trying to get back into working out, but for those looking for a challenge, look elsewhere. Another thing I don't like is how contradicting the two can be. One minute, I believe it was in the ""As*"" workout, Rory is telling you ""exercise but don't be a nut about it, don't be hung up on your body or what you're eating"" and Kim agrees. A few minutes later, they're preaching ""change your diet it's good for you!"" and throughout the DVD they're telling you how important exercise is for you and how you should keep doing it. They aren't very motivating, either; I don't exactly like hearing ""Come on, FATTIES, lets go!"" It doesn't really help my motivation and self-consciousness. They, mostly Kim, complain how much ""It hurts! It's a killer!"" when the move is hardly a stretch, they're not too graceful (nobody's perfect, though) and they very VERY rarely tell you what the next move is and how to do it, but ""don't worry you'll eventually catch on"". I hardly break a sweat and it doesn't really hurt much, if at all. I guess they're good for a laugh or two, but even the name calling and jokes get old fast. All in all, this isn't for everyone. Like said before, if you're just starting out or getting back into fitness, this is good to warm you up. Otherwise, if you want a REAL challenge, go for any Bob Harper/Biggest Loser DVD. Bob will kick your butt all over the place, make you sweat and possibly even cry, but he's an absolute sweetheart and makes you want to work out day after day. Rory and Kim, sorry ladies but not so much.",1299024000,2,1948,4.325136612021858
3612653,5,B001GJOL54,"What a great workout DVD! I don't know what some of these reviewers are talking about. Maybe if you already have the perfect body and exercise everyday then this DVD isn't a challenge, but I was sweating and my heart rate was up after doing one section. I enjoyed it so much I decided to do a second section right away!

The workout is great- combining strength training, yoga, and dance. The moves are fast but you don't have to be a pro to keep up. The instructors are fun and modern, if you liked their books you'll like their workout banter. Kim does a modified version if you find the moves too challenging.

If you want to lose weight, feel better, and have more energy then this is the DVD for you.",1296259200,5,705,4.293233082706767
3612654,4,B001GJOL54,"I really like this, though it really did kick my ass. I've never been the ""working out"" type because I never had to be until a year or two ago. I had heard a little about the Skinny Bitch books/fitness dvds and I was interested and I actually got the book and read it first. It certainly opened my mind into the crazy food world, but I assure you I am not vegan or even vegetarian for that matter. It did make me more health conscious, though which we all should be. In the fitness video thats all they are really trying to promote is to be healthy. They are not shoving their vegan lifestyle down your throat.
I'm not the most poised human being. I'm very clumsy and I have hard time picking up on any kind of choreography, so I'm still catching onto the moves. The girls are very laid back and fun, but at the same time they are still working out. I don't find this dvd offensive. Its just silly and again fun. Its also nice that Rory is more flexible and doing the more intense moves and Kim isn't as flexible, but she is still moving and showing you you can still workout. I am not that flexible, so I can't do all of these things as well as Rory, but Kim gives me some hope lol.
I found this dvd useful and I will continue to use it. Another thing is, if you're more on the serious side of life, this fitness dvd is not for you. This is about having fun and still working towards feeling and looking great. :)",1289779200,2,1414,4.108303249097473

First, there is some annoying music in the background and the instructors don't follow the beat in the music. It was tough following their instructions when the music was in a different tempo. Second, the instructors kept on saying ""namaste"", although they were not even close to doing yoga.",1272326400,,369,4.873015873015873
3612668,1,B001GJOL54,"This really is the worst workout dvd ever. The arms section does not work you out at all and there is virtually no cuing. During some of the segments, the instructor gets bored and instead of counting starts saying dum dum duh duh duh ... badum badum badum... or something like that. The half squats they do in the butt section are just the right distance down to really injure knees and the way the two instructors, who obviously work out harder than this, talk about how ""this is killing me, yada yada"" is just patronizing. Also, if you read the book or watch the interviews on the tape, you find out this is just a marketing arm of their vegan propaganda. Which just makes it weird.",1271894400,3,685,4.4015748031496065

So I really thought this video was going to kick my butt.  It did not.  This is not a hard core work out video.  I definitely didn't break any kind of sweat, no real cardio, no weights.  The instructors are horrible.  I do take into account that they are not real aerobics instructors but this is just plain awful.  There is no cueing and the little bit of cueing that they give is not enough information to let understand the next move. The video is broken up into 4-20 minutes segments but like another review mentioned the arms and abs are only 15 minutes long.  I do think the video is good for someone who is just starting to exercise to get their bodies used to muscle movement but in my opinion you just get a nice stretch out of the video.  Don't waste your money.  There are so many other great workout videos out there!!!",1267488000,5,961,4.283333333333333
3612671,5,B001GJOL54,"I love this workout DVD. I bought it thinking it would be a fun workout, and I was right!

The workout is divided into five sections: First is abs, then comes legs, arm, butt, and a meditation section at the end. The workouts consist of moves that are pilates and yoga related, with some aerobics, as well.

I love the abs section because it starts slow like a warmup but then you get on the floor and start doing some hardcore ab exercises! It slows down again towards the end and the girls always include a stretch after each fifteen minute exercise, which is very nice. Each workout is setup pretty much the same way; you start on both feet to warmup and then you move to the harder, faster-paced exercises.

I really like that this is a fun workout! The two girls, who are also the authors of the books, lead the workout. They always have something motivating or funny to say. They say ""good job"" and ""keep going"" which helps during your exercise to keep you motivated. They also make me laugh half the time, but in a good way! Sometimes it distracts me from the hard work and makes it a fun experience. At the end of my workout, I always feel great and in a wonderful mood!

One thing they do in this workout that I don't really understand is after the first part of the workout in each section they ""switch sides."" Now sometimes, I get what they mean. We started with one leg or one arm and now we do the other one. But for some exercises it just doesn't make sense. Like when we use both legs to do crunches, it doesn't really make sense to do another side because there is none. This isn't that big a deal, though. If you think you got enough of a workout you can just skip the other side part or if you feel motivated and want some extra moves you can do the ""other side"" with them. That is what I usually do.

All the sections have great moves in them. They are not too hard or too easy; most of them are just right! Of course there is maybe one I still don't understand but other than that it's pretty easy to pick up. The first time you may have to stop and figure out what they do but if you do this workout consistently you will get used to the routine in no time and have a lot of fun! Sometimes the ladies go a little too fast in explaining the moves, but like I said this is only a problem the first time. After that you figure it out and the moves are easy enough to get used to. For the fast-paced moves they will usually start slow to show you then move to tempo, which is nice.

Overall I would say this is a great workout dvd! It the only one I have gotten that is a fast-paced aerobics exercise that is actually great to do on a daily basis. It is so much fun you will be wanting to work out! Have fun becoming a skinny bitch!!",1265760000,2,2750,4.111731843575419
3612672,3,B001GJOL54,"I thought this workout was just okay.  In my opinion, it is for beginners.  There is no cueing at all, and sometimes it is difficult to follow.  For example they may be doing something with their legs but the camera angle is waist up only.  I thought the ""bitches"" were kind of funny and the workout was more entertaining than anything.  This is not for an experienced exerciser who is serious about working out.  If that is you, save your money and get something else.  If you are more of a beginner and willing to learn the routines, which should only take a few viewings, this may be an alright purchase.",1258243200,,607,4.414414414414415
3612673,1,B001GJOL54,"Let me start by saying.... I'm very active, exercising 4-6 times weekly. I thought this would be a challenging glute  & arm workout but this is not the case at all.

This  DVD is a total joke. The sessions are not 20 mins as advertised (the glute segment is about 14 mins and the leg is maybe shorter than that, I started the arm session but didn't finish because I wouldn't tolerate the lack of form!!!!!).

The in the ""A**"" workout, Rory looks like  a ""deer caught in headlights"" as she intensely focus in on whoever is in front of her giving them instructions...  That was a total turnoff for me. I tolerated the chatter and language but the lack of form I just couldn't handle.... THESE ARE GETTING RETURNED !!!!",1254873600,3,716,4.427480916030534
3612674,1,B001GJOL54,"If I could give zero stars, I would have.
First of all, why would you put a picture of a woman holding weights on the cover of a workout DVD when there are no weights used in the workout?
Secondly, the ladies keep talking about what a tough workout you're going to have.  Nope. Sorry.  Didn't even break a tiny sweat.
Finally, you can use the word ""A**"" all you want, it doesn't make you edgy or dangerous.  In this case, it comes off as desperate and lame.
I think the 15 minutes are over for these skinny bitches.",1251936000,23,515,4.181818181818182

3612676,4,B001GJOL54,"Although I did return the diet book, I kept the DVD.  It's great.  It's split up into 4/ 20 minute workouts.  So you can customize your routine every day.  There's no special equipment needed and there's Pilates and Yoga incorporated with a short meditation at the end.  I could do without the commentary between the two girls, but the workout is on point and definately gets me motivated.  20 minutes is definately doable!",1246233600,2,423,4.726027397260274
8305747,5,B001GJOL54,"Great workout.  I'm very in shape, yet I still felt the burn.  The pros that really impressed me was that they used no special equipment, just your body weight.  I have seen and loved many a workout series using specialized equipment that was not included or was expensive.  You just use you.  There are modifications, just follow the blonde lady (Kim).  These moves are accessible and if you will learn them if you stick with the program.  The con is they don't explain the moves well, but if you like Richard Simmons (he doesn't explain his moves either, and he's fabulous), you should be fine.  If you don't like using equipment or you can't for any other issues, this is for you.",1488153600,,683,4.540983606557377
8305748,5,B001GJOL54,"I really think this workout is what you make it! I thought it was hilarious and I like the subtle smart ass humor of the brunette. My favorite quote: ""We are liberated to suck at everything!"" I work out often with weights and am very disciplined, and I still love this workout. If you don't find it challenging enough, add ankle weights to the leg workout and use hand weights for the arms. You can add dumbbells to the squat section as well. This makes it very challenging. I also love the 5 minute meditation at the end to start my day. Something different and not boring which puts me in a good mood to start the day. I really love it!",1465948800,,638,4.237704918032787

8305752,5,B001GJOL54,"This DVD has a lot of bad reviews, and I understand if you are some kind of self-disciplined workout junkie that likes strict exercises with an explanation of every movement and the scientific terms of every muscle while working out. But if you are like me, I hate working out. I also hate doing it in public... so I have to find clever dvds that ""trick"" me into a hard workout. This is perfect. The girls entertain me.. they bitch as much as I would.. they stress to just keep moving and make hilarious noises.. the brunette makes a lot of funny kung-fu noises. which keeps me going and distracted. They know they look stupid, and so do I, but the point is to work up a sweat. I did the entire DVD (including mediating at end) and felt like jello. It has enough challenging movements mixed with stretches to give you a break and be able to finish. It is realistic and perfect for someone getting back into working out, or just getting started on a healthy lifestyle. not bitchy at all!! I will buy all the dvds.",1409270400,4,1012,4.35978835978836

8305755,5,B001GJOL54,"(Note: I also posted this review on the Skinny Bitch Boot Camp workout, because it applies to both workouts)
Just for reference, I'm in my mid-20s, 5'6, 147lbs, and fairly fit. I've been doing workout videos since high school, plus I do a lot of jogging and walking.

Ok, now on to the review: If you want to work out the hardest you've ever worked in your life, this isn't it what you're looking for. Go check out Jillian Michaels's ""Hard Body"" or Jeanette Jenkins's ""Bikini Bootcamp"" instead.
However, if you (like me) already do those workouts and want something different that fulfills the following requirements, then I recommend considering getting the Skinny Bitch DVDs:
- Doesn't make you feel like you're going to die, but still burns calories (this and their Boot Camp workout burn 400-500 calories each, according to my heart rate monitor).
- Offers a variety of moves you haven't seen in other workouts. You can tell the routines were created by a professional trainer (Patrick Goudeau). Yeah, both women mess up a couple times, but it's really not as bad as most of the reviews here make it seem. You always see at least one of the backup fitness models/dancers, so it's pretty easy to follow along with the routine during the few times Kim or Rory mess up a little.
- Doesn't trigger your ""exercise ADD"". Most workout videos spend way too much time on each exercise and I get bored 3 minutes in (Jillian and Jeanette are the exceptions here). The Skinny Bitch workouts flow quickly from move to move, so it stays fun. To up the burn, I hold 2lb weights during the entire workout.
- Has choreography that takes a couple times to get. For the same reason that it's NOT boring, I didn't pick up the entire choreography instantly.
At the end of the day, I just enjoy these workouts. The moves and routines are fun and intelligently put together. That's all I really care about. When I feel like the banter is too much, I mute the DVD and put my ipod on instead.

Also, I want to respond to the complaint about Kim and Rory introducing themselves in the beginning. Yes, they should have made it skippable, but c'mon people. The fast-forward button exists for a reason. Besides, when I put in my exercise DVDs I'm still pulling on my workout shoes and getting my water bottle, so I always miss the intros anyway. That one little annoyance has nothing to do with the routines and shouldn't seriously influence how you rate the workouts, IMO.",1391817600,,2448,4.612385321100917
8305756,3,B001GJOL54,"The ab section is barely worth mentioning. I'm not in shape anymore and yet I felt nothing in my abs. The legs section is killer! Some of them though seem more fit for the abs than the legs. There's no cues on what they're doing. I'm able to pick it up fairly well, but my mom, in her 40s, wouldn't be able to keep up with it. The arms section isn't worth mentioning either. You get more arms with the ab and leg sections. There is also a butt section, which is strange to me since it gets worked just the same as the legs in the leg section. All in all this is more of a lower body dvd than anything. I have 3 of these and i don't use them on a regular basis, but if you just want to say that you moved that day, this will do that. I don't see many calories burned either.

Edit: To be fair I am considering using wrist and ankle weights for these dvds. It's not necessarily the moves that are the problem it's the lack of weight making the muscle work. Maybe even double up on wrist weights for the sections so you actually get an arm workout.",1390348800,,1045,4.0
