Its a story of a gangster called Jawad who was one day driving with a school teacher to show him the way to his destination, only for them to have an accident and the teacher had to enter the hospital. Jawad wears his clothes and goes to the school where he teaches claiming he is the teacher ""Despalain"" in hopes of making some etra money. The school assigns him a class full of dumb and naughty students whom he has to deal with. While dealing with these students, he starts changing himself from being a street gangster into an intellectual.

Somehow like Gangsters' Paradise, only funny.",1246233600,2,732,4.496240601503759
