6721509,4,B00O5AJRAU,"I very much enjoyed this movie and I am hoping they continue with the rest of the story.  This movie is based on the best seller ""Left Behind"" which I have never read.  That said, I believe a movie should be able to stand on its own and this movie does.  It is also a remake of the first installment of a 3 or 4 movie set, which begins with Left Behind.  This group of movies begins with the Rapture, where those who believe in God are taken to Heaven so they do not have to endure the suffering in the final days of the devil's reign.  In the Rapture, millions of believers disappear in the blink of an eye, leaving behind a pile of clothing, wedding rings, and any other earthly material possessions.

The story begins in New York, where Nicholas Cage is an airline pilot, about to celebrate his birthday.  His daughter flies home to spend some time with dad on his special day, only to find out he was called to work unexpectedly.  Relationships are strained between Mom and daughter because Mom is a bit pushy with her religious beliefs, and it makes folks uneasy, even her family.  The daughter runs off to catch Dad before he leaves for London, and meets a famous author at the airport when she rescues him from another overbearing religious person who tries to argue her beliefs.  The daughter sees Dad at the airport and also sees the flirty looks between Dad and a stewardess.

Cage is flying the plane when the Rapture happens and is about half-way to London.  As you would expect, there is a tremendous amout of panic when children and adults just vanish ""POOF""!  This POOF happens all over the world, instantly, and leads the storyline into a disaster situation.  Think about it....people just POOF away, whether they are driving a car, train, whatever....POOF....Your infant is in your arms....POOF...POOF...and more POOF.  Shock/confusion/terror/grief...and finally, an attempt at analysis, while trying to deal with the ramifications of the events at hand.

As things begin to slightly calm down and we realize the Believers are the ones who disappeared, some folks begin to take another look at the lives they have been leading and the mistakes they have made, and look at the way ahead.  It was a good movie and Cage does another great job.

As an addendum, I am not here to preach to anyone, and I am not an avid Bible reader.  What you chose to believe is up to you.  I am just quoting something from the Bible below for your added information. I felt compelled to do a little research after watching the movie.

Matthew 24: 36 - 42
""(36) As for the exact day or hour, no one knows it, neither the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. (37) The coming of the Son of Man will repeat what happened in Noah's time. (38) In the days before the flood people eating and drinking, marrying and being married, right up to the day Noah entered the ark. (39) They were totally unconcerned until the flood came and destroyed them. So it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. (40) Two men will be out in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.  Two women will be grinding meal; one will be taken and one will be left.  (42) Stay awake, therefore! You cannot know the day your Lord is coming....""",1413072000,164,3230,4.465076660988075

6721567,3,B00O5AJRAU,"This rapture movie spends way too much time on board a plane (being piloted by Nicolas Cage) and way to little on events on the ground with the disappearance of a lot of people. It takes over half an hour for the rapture to even occur. Even the on the ground stuff is mostly centered around Cage's character's daughter who just runs around the streets in a panic, even though it should be pretty obvious to her what is going on.  She is smoking hot (played by Cassi Thomson) but really isn't that interesting a character other than that. The movie is like a kid friendly viewer end of the world viewing experience.  Supposedly the sinners are left on Earth yet we only pretty much see a bit of looting (basically people running with TV's and other stuff tucked under their arms), bag snatching and mild road rage.  This should have been a lot more dangerous place for Chloe than it seemed to be.

There also seem to be way too many police, firemen, hospital staff and other professions of people who risk their lives for others or care about them, that you'd imagine should be left behind if the good people are taken to Heaven. Yet all air traffic controllers apparently aren't sinners. Not to mention surely Chloe and the dude she met at the airport who seem to be kind caring people should have gone too. The movie really needed to outline something they did in the past, such as killed someone or something to make it plausible they were ""left behind."" Plus as if every kid isn't a sinner, sure the babies can't make conscious choices to do bad things, but some kids do some pretty horrendous things, they've even murdered others.  No way would every kid be saved.

So the movie pretty much just is your standard trying to land a plane with a lot of passengers that gets into mechanical trouble a few hours out from an airport disaster flick.  It really isn't that great compared to most airline potential disaster films.  Not to mention a lot of stuff happens like a motorbike that's had it's headlight on for a day or whatever's battery isn't flat that doesn't seem plausible at all.",1519689600,,2089,4.522546419098143
6721568,5,B00O5AJRAU,"When Nicolas Cages character is being witnessed to, about God loves everybody. This is how the liberal church witnesses. But the truth is people are God's enemies until saved and will go to Hell. God wants to love you, He loves the world in general, so He made a way that mankind can be saved, but it won't be personal until your saved. The dialogue is excellent in this movie!",1518220800,,377,4.4

6721572,2,B00O5AJRAU,"I like it for what it is. Yeah its definitely a cheaper production than the original Left Behind and they tried for a little more humor that fell a bit flat. Still I'd actually recommend this for Christians as I think it showed a little better what its going to be like after the rapture. **SPOILER SPOILER** What I DID NOT like this time around is that the character previously portrayed by Chelsea Noble was this time around portrayed as a gold digger driving a junky car (nothing wrong with this, but they took pains to point it out, as though people with lots of money would automatically have a ""nice"" car).",1515196800,2,612,4.473214285714286

6721577,3,B00O5AJRAU,"This was an entertaining action film. It has to do with faith and trust in God. It has no basis in the Bible at all. Just look at it as an action film with explosions and a plane crash. Supposedly God took millions of people to heaven. The rest of the world has to learn to love God. They are left behind to change their ways. There is plenty of action and drama. There isn't a dull moment. Cage doesn't have to carry the film. His competent costars keep the film interesting.

6721580,4,B00O5AJRAU,"I realize that this new left behind is not like the originals, but it wasn't a remake. Yes, it could have used more details in it and I'm sure a little more action, but it's not a horrible movie. The left behind directors and producers just bought the rights to copy the books so they could stay as close and true to them as possible. This is kind of like the twilight saga, where the first is kinda informative but they rest were much better. Obviously, it's two different genres, and totally separate from each other, but if you have seen the twilight saga, you'll understand what I'm trying to say. The movie is good to me. I like it. I'm very impressed with the disappearing or vanishing as the first one did not show that. Give it a chance. Very excited for the next ones to come out.",1507420800,,789,4.302013422818792

6721582,1,B00O5AJRAU,"The first attempt at a film franchise based on the long running series of books was released in 2000 starring Kirk Cameron, and two sequels quickly followed, both covering the second novel in the series. Why they chose to split that book over two films is beyond me, but it let the third film focus more on the action and looked like it might be a turning point for the low budget series. It was not to be, however, as a fourth film never got off the ground before Cloud Ten Productions lost the rights and the authors of the novels themselves stated they were producing a remake that would hopefully be a big budget Hollywood style action movie that they felt their book deserved. The result is this film that we are reviewing today. And for reasons unknown, it only covers the first half of the first book in the series, taking place entirely on an airplane. This choice by producers not once, but twice now, baffles me to no end for two reasons: 1.) The books are not long, it would only take a good two hour movie to tell the whole story of the first six novels, and after that the books only get shorter and you could probably start  adapting 2 or 3 books into one film. And 2.) there are 12 novels in this series, not counting 3 prequels and one final book taking place after a millennium in Heaven. Now the producers have to know that they are never going to get 16 movies made, nor should they because as I mentioned above about half the books could be crammed into about 2-3 books per film, and this goes for the 3 prequels as well which could easily be one film. They need to abandon all hope for a film franchise and just try to make a television series. These stories would be better suited for TV anyway.",1505779200,,1717,4.299382716049383

6721598,1,B00O5AJRAU,"I just watched this film and can't get over how awful it is! The fact that the book authors praised it is unimaginable. Bad script. Bad acting. A repeat of all the 1970s airport disaster movies (which were far more interesting). The premise of the Left Behind book series has so many possibilities yet the screenwriters chose to focus the people in an airplane (most of the film) and the dopey daughter running through the streets, climbing a bridge!, and banging a truck into objects on a road under construction. A total waste of time and money. The original trilogy may not have Hollywood glitz but those films have better scripts, better actors, characters I cared, plus the Antichrist was in them. The Nicolas Cage version of Left Behind should never have left the gate.",1503532800,,775,4.7481481481481485

6721636,5,B00O5AJRAU,"Ha!
I love science fiction and disaster movies.  I knew there are several movies that deal with the rapture, end times, the second coming, this one movie is the first of these types of movies that I have so far seen.
  I was concerned that I would see amateur acting, heavy handed messages, bible thumping ministers, fundamentalists rants.
This is one reason that I held off for so long, to watch the movies dealing with the end times and second coming.

Well, I was shocked!  I consider this movie to be very very well done!  Good acting , good effects,

One can treat this movie as a science fiction movie if one wishes, there is no direct connection to the events with a second coming of Jesus himself.  You just see some people vanish into thin air, leaving their clothes behind.  Now, when this happens on a packed airplane, the co pilot and a third of the passengers vanish, you can imagine the panic and chaos that happens!  There are also out shots of the parellel chaos in the entire world too.  Panic and empty cars crashing and general mayhem.
Much of the story takes place in the plane.
  Yes, one is constantly reminded about the messages of the Bible that tell of the rapture and end times, but this is not done in a heavy handed manner.  Helps of course to be a Beliver.  But even if you are not, still a good movie.

Apparently this movie is a remake of an earlier movie!  LEFT BEHIND THE MOVIE....2001.

6721724,1,B00O5AJRAU,"Having read and enjoyed the entire series of books, and also seen the previously released three movies, I was curious about this remake.  I am a fan of Nicolas Cage and figured that he'd make an interesting Rayford Steele.  I purchased a copy on Amazon at $5.50 figuring that it must be worth at least that.  I was wrong.  This was truly awful, and it wasn't worth even the minimal sum I paid.  The writers took the initial couple chapters of the first book of the series and totally refocused those chapters into a pseudo-Hollywood action flick.  It entirely missed the real drama of the first book in that the initial disappearances were just the tip of the iceberg, not the 'main event' by any stretch of the imagination.  Ignoring for the moment that the whole ""rapture-of-the-church"" premise is inaccurate and that original books authors' opinions are at odds with most theologians, the books were focused on entirely different set of challenges following their ""rapture"" and the ensuing ""7 years of tribulation"".  The whole premise of this movie was a trumped-up near air disaster (not in the book) with an entirely stupid mid-air clipping of two aircraft (which would not have happened had the great Rayford Steele been even an average pilot ... and also not in the book), followed by a one-woman wrecking crew of Chloe Steele creating an airport landing strip out of an under-construction stretch of highway (also not in the book).  Enough said, do yourself a favor and totally skip this one.  I can recommend the earlier-released Kirk Cameron movie versions (which I also own), as they at least follow the main tenants of the first three books in this series.",1458691200,4,1668,4.821052631578947

6721771,5,B00O5AJRAU,"A new and modern take on the Left Behind concept. I was severely discouraged by critics and Cage haters who repeatedly disparaged this movie. It's a 4 star movie but I gave it 5 stars simply because a lot of the hate being thrust at it is based anti-Christian rhetoric. This is not the retelling of Kirk Cameron's Left Behind. This is a stand alone end of the world film from a Christian perspective much like 2012 but with a lot more hope. If you are not a bigot towards Christians or nostalgic for the Cameron version and you want a action movie and/or a scifi movie, watch Left Behind. Specifics are below.

Acting -4 stars - Subtle, honest and tender portrayals by the leads. Nic Cage was top-notch and not over the top. The extras were so so
Production Values - 5 Stars - Nothing looked like it was done on a cheap sound stage, great location scouting,  the plane scenes were done on the ground but it was not obvious, the attention to detail was meticulous and there were no noticeable gaps in continuity
Diversity -5 stars - Everybody wasn't White and Muslims were portrayed as good people. Hysterical females were kept to a minimum.
Special Effects - 3 stars - Obviously this is where they saved money but not badly done like Birdemic more like Age of Ultron's mess-ups.
Practical Effects - 5 Stars - very real and wonderfully timed . Not cheap or hokey .
Cinematography- 5 stars - the camera staff is to be commended for using excellent equipment and getting shots that worked with the sub par special effects.
Story - 5 stars - Plausible intricate and action packed . After a slow start it becomes a non-stop thrill ride. Dialogue was real with a few weak spots but the actors owned the weak lines and helped to sell them.

All in all a movie worth watching. Paul Lalonde is to be commended. I'm going to buy a physical copy just to spite the critics. A sequel is coming, check out their website to find out more.",1448668800,,1923,4.441926345609065

6721783,1,B00O5AJRAU,"This is almost the worst movie I've ever seen.  I read the whole Left Behind series of books, which was quite a long journey, and while it would take years to critique each one, overall, I enjoyed it as what I'd call apocalyptic fiction.  Given it's such a great story, this movie effort was disappointingly awful.  Seemed to me to just about completely centre around whether Rayford Steele would screw Hattie Durham, or not. Well big deal.  On the other hand, the three that were done as a trilogy, which centered largely around Nicolae Carpathia, were by comparison, award winners. And I'm afraid even in those, apart from a couple of performances (ie, Lou Gossett Jnr, and the guys who played pastor Bruce and Buck Williams) the acting was totally, awkwardly wooden.  I'm not sure I enjoyed the trilogy but at least the approach was much, much better than the Nicholas Cage movie.  My main criticism of the trilogy is that it ended in a very flat way, leaving me going 'well what the ...?'.  Sort of stopped in the middle of nowhere. I was thinking, there must be more movies then, they wouldn't just leave the story like that.  Well, they did.  Hmmm. I suggest you stick with the books.  I saw another reviewer somewhere suggest the story is worthy of real big budget, real stars and I agree. With the right studio/funding etc. (James Cameron?) this could be utterly fantastic, and they'd never run out of sequels.

Millions of people suddenly disappear for no reason and we are not told the reason for this until a couple of characters suddenly surmise that they all believed in God and have been saved. We are not told from what they have been saved, or where they have gone. Given the craziness of the plot, presumably they have beamed up to the Starship Enterprise!

I hate these pseudo Christian films, because they all have the arrogance to assume that the only good people in the world are those that that believe in Jesus. Everybody else is just left to die, hence the scene of the airliner with no pilots and full of perfectly innocent passengers who are all heading for oblivion. Never mind the muslim guy, who seemed to be the nicest of all the characters, but obviously didn't believe in the right God!

Please, please. spare me from any more nonsense like this film. I can't believe that an actor of Nicolas Cage's stature was convinced to take part in it.",1447977600,,1092,4.538071065989848
6721785,5,B00O5AJRAU,Great movie!,1447977600,,12,5.5
6721786,3,B00O5AJRAU,"This movie wasn't Christian in the sense of ministering to people (although some people could be ministered to by this) I guess this would give people a ""sense"" of what times would be like when the rapture does happen! There was very few, if any at all, mentions of God and salvation, prayer etc. But considering the fact that everyone who would do those things would be ALL GONE, makes this movie true to itself. I think it came off very entertaining, but that was it. I thought maybe the filmakers could have developed the realization that YES, the rapture had happened and how the different people would respond according to the lack of relationship with God. Like the crazy lady who had ""It's not real"" tatooed on her arm, I think her having a brief conversation with the ex football player's wife about how to receive Jesus into her heart would've made the movie purposeful. It would've been a good cliff hanger if they then decided to ask Jesus in their heart and them still being there - realizing that they needed to have recieved Jesus before the rapture in order to be a part of it. Maybe if they got more characters to talk about how they resented God or why they aren't believers; I think the rich guy formerly father was a good illustration and I liked what he said about his daughter, however, maybe he could've talk about how he shoved God out of his life (being busy and focused with money doesn't necessarily mean you're not born again believer of Christ). I think it was good - the storyline was a cool action packed movie and the acting was great - it could've used a little more of the ""lack of faith"" element to drive the point home that you don't wan to wait till that day to realize that the rapture occured.

If you're watching this because the rapture occured, I believe you still have an opportunity to receive Jesus! You might not get spared having to go through tough times ahead - but God is merciful! As long as you have Him, you're future is good! Don't ever delay EVER AGAIN having faith of His love and mercy for you! Nows the time to believe.",1447891200,4,2076,4.43455497382199
6721787,4,B00O5AJRAU,"Released in 2014, Left Behind stars Nicolas Cage as an adulterous airplane pilot on a trans-Atlantic flight who has to save the remaining passengers after many of them mysteriously disappear; meanwhile his daughter back in New York (Cassi Thomson) struggles with the disappearance of her little brother and mother (Lea Thompson). Chad Michael Murray plays a famous reporter on the plane while Nicky Whelan plays a sexpot flight attendant.

This is sort-of a theatrical version of the 2000 direct-to-video movie of the same name. I say sort of because its a severely truncated rendition, which doesnt mean its necessarily bad, but fans of the bestselling book will likely be disappointed by the smaller focus. It worked for me, however, and Ill explain why momentarily but, first, lets consider two other reasons for the critical feeding frenzy

Some people might have been disappointed because they were expecting blockbuster quality when, in fact, the movie only cost $16 million. (The original cost $4 million, in case you were wondering). While $16 million is enough to make an okay theatrical release, its not even close to the typical $100 million plus required to make a modern blockbuster disaster flick, like San Andreas. As such, the movie has a glorified TV-movie vibe, which film snobs zero-in on and lambaste.

Another big reason for the uber-negative reviews, of course, is the Christian-themed subject. Since the average person understandably finds the very idea of faithful believers being snatched away in the blink of an eye ludicrous they hold the movie in contempt. What I don't get is WHY such people would even be interested in viewing a movie like this when they know up front that its based on a massively popular book with overt biblical themes.

So why did I like this movie? Because I was able to ignore the relatively low-budget production and get involved in the lives of the characters and their amazing story. I say amazing because how else would you describe a situation in which masses of people, including all children, suddenly vanish with only their clothing left behind? It would be an incredible experience, to say the least, not to mention a serious wake-up call for those who remain. The movie effectively reflects this. In short, this is a What if? movie. You don't have to believe in the Bible whatsoever to enter into the story of the characters and enjoy it for what it is  a What if the Rapture really happened movie. I don't believe in malevolent and wickedly ugly aliens with acid for blood, but that doesnt prevent me from liking the Aliens flicks.

Furthermore, I appreciate the smaller focus of the story compared to the original movie. By doing this, it doesnt cut off more than it can chew. It focuses on one family and one airplane & its passengers and drives its point home without being awkwardly preachy. Lastly, Cage and Murray make for strong male protagonists while Thomson and Whelan are more than effective in the female department, including being extremely easy on the eyes.

The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Provo, Utah.

the movie. But no, again it goes back to slow mo, and even worse
it turns out to be a religious movie! I guess the church is using the
movies to attract people.

big disaster or something going on...?

6721866,4,B00O5AJRAU,"Cage still looks like the Elvis impersonator from Wild At Heart - which I found mildly amusing. Man, that hair!  In an early scene, a Christian woman makes a point of end time events to a famous news reporter... but the actress is made to play the scene as belligerent and lacking compassion, hardly how a true believer would act. So, I expected this film to be a Christian-basher. Fortunately, it wasn't. The scenario of the rapture (harpazo - catching away/seizing/snatching) of the true believers in Yeshua (Jesus) was simplistic in its depiction, but sufficient to get the idea across, and well played.  You get a sense of the chaos that could ensue, as well as the awful grief of knowing you were left behind.  Lea Thompson (Marty McFly's mom in Back To The Future) is the recently saved mom - trying to get her family to heed her urgent call to get right with God. Surprisingly, the movie even brings up the spiritual truth that not all who say ""Lord! Lord!"" will be saved.  The latter part of the movie was a bit ""Con-Air"", but it was an enjoyable ride. I would recommend this as a great ice-breaker for those unfamiliar with the rapture concept.

6721917,5,B00O5AJRAU,"I've seen the first Left Behind movie and this movie is far more terrifying. It is basically an airplane drama where every second causes you to sit on the edge of your seat. From the time the plane takes off until it lands you will not know what is going to happen next. When people disappear from the plane things get really out of whack. Panic sets in as people try to figure out what has happened. On the ground things are much, much worse. To be honest I was just really impressed with Nicolas Cage's acting. He seemed so calm when life was all going to hell around him. This movie basically only details the beginnings of the rapture. I'll have to read the novel to get the full picture. But as far as suspense goes, this is tops.

On the ground, Rayfords daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) looks for her missing brother in the city that has turned into chaos. So she walks, walks and walks in the street until she is finally required to do something incredible, a feat that even John McClane cannot do.

Left Behind is a faith-based thriller or a religious treatise in the form of disaster movie. Or you may say it is propaganda. Whatever it is, the problem of the film is simple. It is boring. With wooden acting from the cast, cheap effects and a poorly told story, there is no sense of mystery or tension. One extra star as I like Nicholas Cage.",1435363200,,890,4.591194968553459

movies for many years, as I'm sure many have, i just want to be entertained and watch movies with that in mind.
(The review does have a basic-flow of the story-line)
'Ray Steele' (Nicolas Cage) an airline pilot is about to fly passengers from 'New York' to 'London' this day....
It's his birthday his wife had planned a celebration, however he's accepted the task having perhaps selfish motives
for doing so.
Before boarding he briefly meets up with his daughter 'Chloe' (Cassi Thompson) which he'd not expected, before
which she'd rescued reporter 'Buck' (Chad Michael Murray) from a lady telling him that all the signs were in place
for a catastrophic happening.
'Ray' has been playing away with a flight attendant.
Reporter 'Buck' is among the passengers on-board 'Ray's' London bound flight.
'Chloe's' mother is among those that have predicted the end of days though daughter 'Chloe' and husband 'Ray' do
not share her beliefs.
Tales of doom begin to become reality, people disappearing including 'Chloe's' younger brother who'd she'd been at
the local shopping centre with.
On-board the flight several passengers also go missing, causing panic, the plane is 30,000 feet up in the air, where is
there for these people to have gone ??
The passengers have no idea that what has occurred on-board has also happened below, where, panic, is widespread.
'Chloe' is unable to find her brother, whilst unexplained things happen around her, she also needs to find her mother.
In the air, 'Ray' has been unable to make contact with control and is as equally confused as his remaining passengers.
'Reporter' 'Buck' try's to help keep his fellow passenger's calm, even taking the role as 'Ray's' number two, the Co-Pilot
being among those that had disappeared, 'Ray's' priority is to protect those on-board as best he can.
'Ray' decides to turn back to New York, but, is there going to be enough fuel to do so after a mid-air collision has caused
damage the plane.
Drama in the sky and drama on the ground.........if the plane can get back to New York, what will they find.........
Those that believe or are without fault have been taken, all Worldly belongings left behind.
Not having read the book i cannot say how closely or otherwise the film follows the story, though reading some reviews, it
seems, not.
With apocalyptic movies of this kind, i myself hope and indeed expect more in the way of special-effects than this movie
actually has, and, perhaps, a bit more tension, though there are some tense moments, it could and should have been so
much better.",1435017600,,2662,4.8915929203539825

6721954,1,B00O5AJRAU,"Let Left Behind stand as a cautionary tale to all in Hollywood who do not pay their taxes and are forced when caught (like Nicolas Cage) to make any film that comes along to generate income. Based upon the mega-million selling series of novels that depict the post-Rapture landscape of a dissolving  America, the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, follows a Christian Tribulation Force (led by Cage's character, airline pilot Ray Steele)  as they attempt to bring down the reign of the Anti-Christ, Nicolas Carpathia who has set up a one-world government in Jerusalem. Religious convictions aside, this premise would have made for a very entertaining film had the film, in fact, been about any of the plot lines that I just mentioned.

Instead, we get Cage sleepwalking through a script so dull and amateurish that I'm sure God himself would turn the screenwriters to salt if given the opportunity. ""Hi, I'm Nicolas Cage and I am playing an airline pilot who in my ennui has grown weary of my relentlessly judgmental Evangelical spouse and would really just like to sleep with any flight attendant so inclined. During a routine flight to London three quarters of my passengers and crew have been Raptured, leaving an ungodly remnant to match wits with Mr. Carpathia, restore order and save civilization. However for lack of time and budget, today we'll concentrate on the embedded soap opera surrounding my infidelity and stare wide-eyed at the worst SFX this side of a 1950's Saturday afternoon double-feature."" This is a wretched film that begs the question, why did I rent this and why was I spared from God's wrath, for surely this cinematic doggerel is hell on earth.",1434672000,,1689,4.898601398601398

I haven't read the books, I watched the 2000 version of this movie AFTER watching this one (it isn't great, but compared to this one, it's citizen kane), but at least the other one was genuine in its attempt to make a movie out of the dispensational pretribulation understanding of eschatology.

This is why people should not make movies about subjects they know absolutely nothing about. I found nothing overtly objectionable as a Christian viewer, I just felt like they only told a fraction of what could have been a very compelling story. It's like hearing a Christian story from a secular point of view. They tried to make a movie about God, while simultaneously trying not to offend anyone who doesn't like God, lol.

Because this whole 2 hour stretch focused on the first 25 minutes of the original Left Behind. That being said it's probably doubtful, and this movie became one of the biggest ADD plot deviations of all time. It's not that it denied the story, but rather it focused on the vanishing and then a three hour flight (condensed to 1 hour) and a successful landing of the plane. The original movie had so much more to offer in just 90 minutes - but perhaps a slower pace is what we need. Characters were left undeveloped however - two dimensional versions of the book and movie characters. Boring people you don't truly connect with. All of the original cast was infinitely better. The soundtrack though lacking is definitely better here than the cheesy 90s backstreet boys leftovers from the original flick.

Not really worth your time - but it may be if they expand on it and the sec nd movie follows the second half of the first (original) movie.",1432252800,,1073,4.588541666666667

The idea that the reporter is going to sit down with a random angry stranger at the airport us also quite farfetched. And then the musical score... Gah. I've heard better stuff on early 90's sitcoms.

6722059,2,B00O5AJRAU,"2 stars for the big name actors. Makes a decent adventure movie but it is certainly lacking much of the Christian message that the books and even the first movie had. It's sad that Hollywood today takes a Christian movie and tries to remake it with big name actors while nearly depleting the original intention of the film and books, to bring people closer to God. The original movie was a little hokey but the message was wonderful and was pretty spot on with the book. This version was ridiculous.",1430352000,,499,4.555555555555555

But it is a story about when God comes to take his people to heaven and leaves the rest behind to choose to follow Him ,(or not to )  during the great troubles that are and will continue to come on the earth. This is all in the Bible and is happening now. It is a fast moving movie and has many true aspects of life in it. I thought it was well done. The only things I would have changed is, I would have had more of the bible verses that went along with the movie in it, and the daughter at the end was a bit much with the rescuing of the plane.

I am not a believer in the Rapture like others do, I would rather prepare for the worst but pray for the best. Even though I am not a believer in the Rapture I did enjoy the Left Behind books. I looked at this movie as a series of possible events that could have happened between the the time of the disappearances and the plain landing.

One thing for those who did not read the books the co-pilot, Chris was not one of the ones who disappeared Chris was left behind and he committed suicide in the bathroom after the plane landed. Chloe and Buck did not get together as fast in the book as they did in this story.

With all that said I did like the take they had on the book and I will probably go back and read the books. I have not read them in years.",1425945600,,890,3.9664804469273744

I guess you could call me a new ager, sprinkled with a dash of buddhism.  I believe we all come from the Light and will return to it one day, and that we should be kind to each other, the planet and all living creatures,  but I don't go to church or follow the bible.  I thought I would share that so you know from where my perception of this movie stands.  I have seen many negative reviews from the Christians who expected a lot more christian activity & dialogue.  The story itself was about a genuine christian event, but it was pleasantly light on the bible thumping.  In most Christian movies, it seems there are a lot more Christian characters with a lot of discussion about religion.  In this movie, it was a cookie cutter disaster movie attempt to appeal to everyone.  They may have been better off keeping it in line with the previous Kirk Cameron productions.

6722341,2,B00O5AJRAU,This movie was a profound piece of garbage that I could not stop watching.  The script is terrible and the acting is very poor in about 70 percent of the actors with speaking parts.  My wife and I wanted to watch it based on how bad it's reviews were.  We thought it would be a good laugh.  It was a lot of laughs.  It was hard to keep up the comedy spirit with my wife because every ten minutes I had to spend five minutes telling myself not to be ashamed for wasting time watching it.  I really am upset by the fact that I have to select two stars instead of one star.  I have tried to find a way in my mind to do this and I can't.  As horrible as this movie is I sat through the whole thing.  Good luck with this movie whether you choose to watch it or not.,1425168000,5,760,3.8516129032258064

Of course, the standard for the genre has to be Thief In the Night, whose classic intro song is redone in the closing credits. Anyway, when you see enough of these, there are certain things you look for. For example, how is the actual rapture depicted? In one film, Apocalypse, I think, all the clothes are neatly folded - a bafflingly awesome touch. Left Behind's key rapture scene, which I won't spoil, was pretty brilliant, maybe the best I've seen. But I was disappointed by one scene where a car crashes through a shopping mall. The car should have had the bumper sticker ""In Case of Rapture, This Car Will Be Unmanned."" I absolutely would have given this movie 5 Stars. In these films, I also look for good religious content, and this one is somewhat lacking. It often plays more like a straightforward Hollywood action movie. Still, it's better than Omega Code where well-developed Christian characters are woefully, and strangely, lacking. This movie also doesn't touch on the one-world government, anti-Christ stuff. To sum up, this is an enjoyable and entertaining film with likeable actors, who sometimes have some awesomely bad lines. It's a solid entry into an often underappreciated genre of filmmaking.",1424563200,,1328,4.906666666666666

6722380,4,B00O5AJRAU,"I had very low expectations for this movie, because the reviews were so bad, but I actually liked it.  If I had gone into it thinking it would be great, I might feel differently, but as it was, I really enjoyed it.  I read the books years ago and saw the original movies when they came out.  In my opinion, the production values are better on this than the older movies, but this one in no way stays true to the books.  Basically, they have taken part of the core story and made a disaster flick out of it.  I am a fan of disaster flicks though, particularly cheesy ones, so that it no diminished my enjoyment of it.  (I was kinda hoping a shark might attack the plane though...)  They did a lot of tweaking of details on the part of the story that they did tell, but that didn't bother me.  In fact, it added to it a bit, since I know the original story so well.

As a Christian movie though, it falls far short, particularly compared to the books.  No one gets saved in this movie and the plan of salvation is not given.  Basically, the movie ends before they get to the part where various characters begin to accept Christ.  They don't introduce the Nicolae Carpathia character or touch on that part of the story at all, instead focusing on the Steele family and the airplane drama.  The movie ends up being a secular telling of a religious event.  I did not note anything that was anti-Christian though.  There are a number of times when different characters say things against God (why does He let bad things happen and such) and basically roll their eyes at people who are talking about God or the Bible.  There is no question though who is actually right and who is actually wrong.  The Christians are shown to be the ones that were right after all, while those who mocked at left behind to face a scary future.",1424563200,2,1818,4.315634218289086

The scenes of the passengers in 1st Class, was so deplorable, I was embarrassed for EVERY single actor involved. It truly was disgraceful. Nick likes to pick some really quirky stuff: Knowing, Next, Raising Arizona, National Treasure, etc. What WAS he thinking with this role? Must have been a nice paycheck. This director should find another career path.

First, let's clear the theological debate fog... a pretribulation rapture is but one interpretation, of several New Testament verses regarding the end of days. People who gum up book and movie reviews, with theological debate, are missing the point... these are fictional books and movies! Christians who denounce this interpretation as ""bad theology"" are just as boorish as those who prop up this one interpretation. Guess what? Last days prophecies are somewhat ambiguous, don't pretend that they aren't!

People who don't want ""preachiness"" need to avoid films based on Biblical interpretation. How simple is that? Don't fill up a review forum, ranting about how bad or stupid religion is. Know what you're going to see. Avoid what you know is going to irritate you.

Now that all that nonsense it out of the way, let's review the FILM.

The story wasn't as much of a ""Hollywood"" upgrade, that I was hoping it would be. The Kirk Cameron film was much more ambitious. In the Kirk Cameron film, we are treated to an Arab attack on Jerusalem, and the mysterious protection of the city. We have conspiracy theories involving ambitious bankers, and a one world currency. And best of all, with have a humanitarian sounding AntiChrist who manipulates and murders his way into power.

With this film, we have an airliner with panicking passengers, and a damaged wing. And we have a college student, wandering around the chaotic streets of her home town or city.

Some of the theological debates are well-written. A zealous Christian arguing with Chloe, at the airport book store, is rather cliche... sounding angry as she yells the atheist that ""it's a fallen world.""  That style of argument usually falls flat. Chloe quickly bonds with the agnostic ""Buck"" Williams, and attraction sparks fly. Buck tells Chloe about how women and children of faith die in floods and mudslides. Message received... life is full of tragedy and horror, for believers and unbelievers alike.

At the very least, his isn't some goody two shoes Christian film, that doesn't acknowledge harsh truths.

ZAP... believers and children disappear. Chaos ensues. The would be adulterer Ray and daughter Chloe know what their wife (and Mom) believed about the coming rapture... but fight the possibility that she was right. Eventually, they both seem to concede to the conclusion.

In flight drama between passengers falls flat. The obnoxious little person is an unfortunate choice of character. The kindly Muslim is a twist. The senile old woman ""left behind"" is especially tragic to me... she's senile, and now she's left to hell on Earth. Not very inspiring. One would think the writers wanted the viewers to be angry with God... intentionally.

Nicholas Cage does feel flat in this film. Bland. The lesser known actor ""Brad Johnson"" did a better job, in the earlier film incarnation of Rayford Steele.

The girl who plays Chloe does a very good job, and her scene on top of the bridge is very well done. Her efforts that lead to the plane landing safely are also well written, making Chloe the hero of the film.

But without the world politics, the conspiracies, and the maneuvering AntiChrist, this is just a survival film. Not inspirational, in any sense. Since the film did poorly, I doubt they'll make another one. Tis a shame. Much material is wasted. Was it's failure... on purpose?",1423958400,,3390,4.968197879858657

More than likely he's wondering why he took the acting job in this movie to begin with.

6722515,1,B00O5AJRAU,"Battlefield Earth is a notorious film about the invasion of Earth eons ago. It is a piece of science fiction burdened with overloaded references from the doctrine and beliefs of Scientology. Most of the actors in the movie were Scientologists, John Travolta being the most prominent. There were many problems with the film but the dogma, the imagery from Scientology just dragged it down to where it was just embarrassing to watch.

Welcome to Left Behind, Battlefield Earth, Christian style. And what applies to Battlefield Earth applies to Left Behind, and then some.

This is a bad movie. The characters are cardboard, one-dimensional personalities drawn in a predictable setting. We've seen the other Left Behind movies. The only difference in this one is that it features Nicholas Cage, who unfortunately does not salvage this travesty. (And what is he doing in this movie, anyway?) Whatever dramatic development is dragged down by the producers beating their agenda over your head. The movie also suffers from bad acting.
This is not a condemnation of the doctrine of the Rapture, the modern formulation of which is at best at the fringes of Christianity. This is just a bad movie. With better acting and a better script it could have been at least watchable.

6722567,5,B00O5AJRAU,"This movie was a little slow and didn't follow the books but I loved it any ways , and here's why : First of all when the rapture first happens there will be such confusion that noone has ever seen before and the movie shows that . It shows the disapearance of the innocent and the Christians as well . It also shows how some people will come to realize right away what has happened ! The whole movie actually takes place on an aircraft but the very end leaves you wanting to see the next movie . Looking out over a world newly left behind is a definate eye opener !",1423008000,,566,4.0625
6722568,4,B00O5AJRAU,"I have never read any of the 16 best selling books by authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. But these books were best sellers and quite popular from 1995 - 2007. So, going into this movie I had nothing to compare it to. There were a number of movies made back in the early 00's with Kirk Cameron. I think I may have seen one of them but I really don't remember those movies either.

I know that there are more bad reviews for this movie than there are good. You would think that this movie is terrible from the number of negative reviews. Some of them I think are justified and others I think are just made up reviews by those who didn't see the movie, but hate it because it has to deal with the Bible and Christianity.

I will say that I really enjoyed this movie. As a Christian the thing that struck me the most is how the movie focused on those that will be left behind after the rapture occurs. The subject matter and the conversations that were posed in this movie really made you think.

If you want to watch a movie that will give you some food for thought. Watch this movie. Don't let the reviews of others make the decision for you. Make the decision for yourself.",1422921600,3,1175,4.213333333333333

6722599,2,B00O5AJRAU,"Puzzling to say the least. It is at one time a religious movie/book, but this version tried to stay partially away from the religious theme...and yet didn't, puzzling. I guess it was 'less' preachy that the earlier version with huge religious overtones.
This version however was a bigger production and again puzzling as if one if heavy on religion, it may not do it for you, and if you aren't, then it probably will not do it for you as it leaves 'those on Earth' suspended in a plot with no real end.",1422576000,,502,4.408602150537634

6722616,1,B00O5AJRAU,"It's been about several years since the last movie in the aborted original Left Behind film franchise was released, and much to my disappointment, the production crew left the whole story of the Tribulation forever stuck midway through with no completion. With the reboot movie I was hoping that the first story in the book series would get the big-budget treatment it deserved in the first place. Alas, it got reduced to a shoddy airplane disaster movie that only barely covers the first half of the first book, leaving other important characters like the Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia waiting for a sequel to be introduced. It may still be an effective evangelistic tool for people to witness the gospel of Jesus Christ with, but as a film adaptation it still leaves much to be desired. God created a perfect world in six days; why should it be too much to ask for a perfect film adaptation of an end-times book from people who actually care about the subject material?",1422403200,,970,4.779761904761905

But this was not a terribly produced film like most of the reviews have intimated. The special effects were not overdone and were believable. I found it to be true to the book. I think it should be said that there was some good acting as well, I mean...Nicolas Cage, come-on. The movie was also quite effective and believable in depicting what a biblical rapture might look like.",1422403200,,555,4.450980392156863
6722619,1,B00O5AJRAU,"Terrible movie. Terrible premise, terrible acting, made for TV quality. You can tell it was written by a ""Christian"" because they are the only ones ""saved."" I cannot believe Mr. Cage was involved with something this bad. He is the absolute only one on the movie that can act at all. BTW, the body is separate from the soul. If god ""took"" us to heaven our souls would leave, our bodies would stay behind. In other words, we would die! Not nearly as pleasant as people disappearing to go into Gods care.

Having said all of that, I generally like movies that try to deal with religion, God, etc. One thing I believe is that to often movies go out of their way to ignore religion and belief completely. To me though, there is nothing good or interesting about this movie. Its not even an original concept. Heck, the movie, This is the end, was better and it didn't even make any attempt to be serious.

I'm not blaming the actors, because someone was directing and producing this.  At some point someone should have said ""Direct to video"".  So much was bad with it that it's hard to think it wasn't deliberate.  Was Mel Brooks PRODUCERS behind this or Scientology?

6722637,2,B00O5AJRAU,"The first version of this film by Kirk Cameron, was mediocre at best.  The acting was poor, and the narrative was just not plausible.  This film was different.  The act was spot-on.  But the narrative was just not plausible.  One might say, ""Well, miracles aren't plausible.""  But that is circular reasoning, which cannot result in any usable conclusions.  As a conservative Christian, who accepts the Bible as God's word, I have read this series and been very entertained.  But entertained in the way that any fantasy literature entertains.  The problem with the culture of the rapture is that it is a connect-the-dots type of Bible interpretation that ignores the original readers of the texts.  I have never seen a Pre- or Post-Millenialist ask the question, ""Why did God give Revelation to the Christians of the late first century AD?""  The film actually does portray the pure hatred that some pre-millenialists have towards the rest of us.  The woman who confronts Buck Williams in the airport at the beginning of the film expresses that hatred very clearly in her non-verbals and her para-verbals.

Unfortunately, even that was absurdly bland.

If you don't flinch every time someone brings up Christianity, then watch the original 3 movies with Kirk Cameron.

Too bad that he probably did this reboot of the novel by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins was probably for the second reason that he stated. Sad but true.

This apocalyptic thriller film entitled Left Behind was simply a disaster. No question about it. This movie so simplistic and so unbearable that a Christian watching it would feel insulted.

The Christian message that it was trying to impart was so silly and it probably would not register to the Christian viewer at all for it is far from what Jesus' thought his followers or the scriptures. The characters involved in the story were simply moronic and silly that they would more or less elicit laughter without doing so instead of logic. Added to that, the disaster that happened in the film when people started disappearing and the panic that it caused was far from being realistic. Finally,the climax was just simply irrational especially when the characters realized that they needed to turn to the Lord for the end of the world could come at a time one least expected it. Too bad that the viewer that never felt any sense of danger at all and would not even feel the character transformation that occurred in the film. It was just simply ridiculous.

Obviously,Nicolas Cage made this film simply to pay the bills and nothing more. I just hope is able to settle his enormous debts such as : three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items such as a dinosaur skull of a Tarbosaurus for which he paid $276,000 in an auction after winning a bidding contest against Leonardo DiCaprio together with unpaid real estate taxes after having the settlement he made with his ex-girlfriend,Christine Fulton who sued him for $13 million and paying the IRS $6 million for unpaid taxes so that he could appear in better movies the next time around.",1421712000,,2173,4.698162729658793

I am not interested in rapture fiction.  my biggest question is.. if lahaye is so vehemently opposed to the doctrine of election and that everyone will be saved then why was there anyone left at the rapture???  the rapture doctrine proves the doctrine of election which lahaye states he hates.  time lahaye is a complete and total freak and false teacher who has made billions off these movies and books.  Nicolas cage, who I normally love, was boring and probably did it because he needed the money because he isn't a Christian.  he was the draw to get people in, which in my mind casts serious doubts on the so called Christian makers of this film since they knowingly cast a non Christian in an important part in what is supposed to be a movie about Christianity.  cage wasted  his talent and the filmmakers wasted their film.",1421712000,,959,4.502890173410405

I do not think so, if so they are lame like this movie. This movie is a total waste of time , the acting is boring, the characters are boring , the movie is slow  as well, listening to this cinematic bible preaching . There will always be wars and problems there will never be a perfect world or people  never has been for thousands of years.

If I had to describe it, the movie was like watching one of the Airport plane disaster movies of the 1970's and 80's and in this case instead of a bomb, loss of pilot or sinking beneath the sea; the disater was the Rapture. Some acting and special effects were okay. A lot of bad acting and poor character portrayal in the movie.

A lot of the chaos scenes just did not make sense. Her brother is in her arms when he is taken, and yet, even though she has his clothes - which means if he was there he would be running around naked - she is searching the stores, going to accidents and slipping into the hospital - how would he have ended up there?.

Second, the minute the Raptre hits,rather than being in panic, trying to find out what has happened or if family is okay, everyone turns to looting. I am not convinced looting would be the first reaction to having people disappear. Most would fear a teorrist attck and run for safety in case it was a biological weapon of mass destruction.

Finally, every Christian the the movie was a jerk. Plain and simple. None of them were presented with any respect or dignity. If all the Rapture did was take out all the jerks, then what's the problem?

6722739,3,B00O5AJRAU,"I gave a three because i read the authors of the left behind series felt it did not convey the message from their book Left Behind.  In the book Chloe is away at school, Hattie knows Rayford is married, the copilot commits suicide, the plane lands at original airport, and Rayford seeks the answers.

First of all if you were astonished it was based on religion, then apparently you missed the memo on it being based on the left behind series which happen to be based on the Bible (revelations).  And if thats why you gave it a 1..well it was your fault for not checking it out.  Secondly if you were offended because you feel your religious standpoint was mocked..well sorry to say..if millions did vanish there would be chaos.  You cant say people wouldnt be trying to rob stores etc Because that already happens with riots.  And I saw nothing that indicated those people were atheists.  Thats just plain mob hysteria, a well documented social phenomenon.

I felt the movie potrayed what kind of panic would ensue if millions vanished in the blink of an eye and I like the fact that they took an older movie and attempted to bring some luster to it.  I am dissatisfied with the way the story unfolded though as well as the loss of the message.  The woman in the begining speaking to Buck when Chloe interferes really disturbed me. She acted more condescending than informational which should not be in a movie where there is a message.
Acting fine..seemed kind of blase' at times but overall good.
Religious movies are never big crowd pleasers.  People want big shoot em up blow em up movies and the good guy getting the girl.  So if you can get over the not happy just surviving ending (which is what it would be like anyway) I think this movie would not be considered bad.

The Gospel was not presented at all; you heard vaguely about ""God"" and ""making a choice"" and most Christian beliefs by way of the non-Christians.

The book and the sequels were about those who were left behind...not the actual rapture. The movie was only 5% of the entire book. The plane scene was minor and didn't last long.

My primary reason for watching most movies is for the action but this is not an action movie. It is an intense, suspenseful drama that will keep your attention from start to finish. The storyline is very good and the acting is pretty good also. You will not need any biblical knowledge whatsoever to understand or follow this story, nor would you need to have read the books or seen the previous version of the Left Behind movie to fully enjoy this remake. I do not give spoiler alerts but I will say that this movie is about a world changing event and the speculation of how and why it happened and who is responsible. This is truly a family movie, No nudity, No dirty language and no excessive violence. It is also a family movie because it covers relationship issues in the home and on the job. This is excellent entertainment for the entire family with something for everybody, Suspense, Romance and a bit of Comedy.

Now as a Christian I can tell you that this is not a preaching movie at all. I do not remember the name of Jesus being spoken anywhere in this movie. Actually this film presents several arguments from people who do not believe in God without any rebuttal. The rapture is not identified or explained in this film. What is explained is that knowing the bible does not save people. You must believe what is said in the bible to be saved. As Christian films go this is definitely one of the very best acting performances across the board. Cassi Thomson, Chad Michael Murray and Nicolas Cage all do an outstanding job.

6722793,5,B00O5AJRAU,good movie...makes u think....to bad the world cant get it....,1421020800,,62,5.3
6722794,5,B00O5AJRAU,"This is a good movie.  I own the older Left Behind series and I liked those as well.  This movie is just as good, just a completely different style.  In fact, the special effects are much better than the original Left Behind series with the exception of Left Behind: World at War (the special effects in that one were very good).  The acting is excellent as you would expect in a Nicolas Cage movie.  You should definitely watch it yourself and draw your own conclusions.  My whole family really enjoyed this movie.

Be advised that this movie is a departure from all past movies starring Nicolas Cage and some of his fans are sure to react negatively because they will not get what they are used to.  Realize that this is a movie about a Biblical event and if such movies offend you, you may not enjoy it.  However, if you fit that category, you should watch it anyway since it will do you no harm and might start you thinking about things that will lead to your greater good.  Most great actors at some point in their career want to try something different and apparently Nicolas Cage is good at whatever he does.

PROS:

1. Most scenes are realistic and the dialogue is very believable most of the time.  If you don't like to think about Bible prophecy, that's a sure sign you need to.
2. Arguably there will be a peel of thunder when the Lord calls his people out; there was a peel of thunder in the background at the moment the rapture occurred in this movie.  Personally, I think this is true and most rapture/tribulation movies seem to omit that detail.

CONS:

A large part of the movie takes place on aircraft; therefore from an aviator standpoint the script could use a little work on some of the sequences.  For example scenes where the pilot is holding the control yoke with both hands (white knuckle stuff).  Generally one would hold the yoke/stick with the left hand leaving the right hand free for other tasks.  If you lost hydraulics you might grasp the yoke with both hands in a panic, but in an aircraft of that size, in such a situation nobody could move it.

As long as I am pointing out technical oversights from an aviators viewpoint:
  1. why is it that in all the discussion of in flight problems nobody suggested transferring fuel from the leaky right wing to the center tank or left wing?
  2. In the Scene where the unmanned aircraft is approaching nearly head on, FAR's state ""When 2 aircraft are converging head on or nearly so, each shall give to the others right"".  Even with the an unmanned aircraft approaching, this manoeuvre should be executed first which would solve the problem of an imminent mid air collision.  After that, trying to establish radio contact with the other aircraft might be helpful, especially to other aircraft at that altitude who might be listening in.
  3. At the last moment, the pilot initiates a climb to avoid collision; another bad choice. Since Air Traffic Control usually maintains flight levels with a minimum of 1000 ft above and below aircraft on converging vectors, a quick, moderate push forward on the yoke would have dropped the aircraft below the other approaching aircraft rapidly.  A climb would be the last choice since it would be much slower than a turn or descent even in a jet.

That's all the constructive criticism I have and anyway most people probable would not be aware of these things, so it would not detract from their enjoyment. This is a very good movie and I will certainly watch it again and add it to my library.

SUMMARY:

At first glance, I was a little puzzled at all the 1 star reviews.  In retrospect, I feel sure many of them were expecting the usual Nicolas Cage fare, instead of a movie which depicts a Biblical event.  Most such fans might not even be aware of the Left Behind series of books or movies and would not be expecting what they saw.  I am glad I watched this movie.

At any rate, I took the time to read most of the 1 star reviews (when there was 88 of them) and many are suspiciously similar.  These cookie cutter reviews make me wonder about the motive for writing it.  Personally I try to avoid pointing out flaws I have already seen enumerated in a *lot* of other reviews; it's redundant.  For example, a many of the 1 star reviews reiterate ""they own the books and love them but hated the Kirk Cameron movies and the Nicolas Cage movie is even worse, it's boring, couldn't finish it, the acting is bad, the script is bad etcetera"".  I'm always suspicious when there are lot of critical reviews with the same patterns and especially when most of the criticisms are blatantly false.  However, I suspect most of these folks were just ""piling on"" because they did not see what they expected; that's a common knee jerk reaction.

For those comparing the books to the movies, to capture all the detail of any good book in a movie is an impossible task as any avid reader knows.  The producer just has to do the best job achievable.  This movie is a very good one with skilled actors at a time when truly entertaining Christian movies are hard to find.  If the movie is to make sense, the first thing the producer must do is limit the situations to be portrayed and much of this one (but certainly not all) takes place in the aircraft.  The sudden disappearance of the co-pilot, one flight attendant and many passengers makes for a thrilling movie; how is the pilot to control the ensuing panic and get that bird back on the ground?  After all, the buck always stops with the man in the left seat.

For parents with small children and purists, there is 1 curse word (sh*t) in the movie and I might not have caught that except I am hearing impaired and always have CC on.  The actress has her back turned and the exclamation isn't too noticeable.  All of us have trouble bridling the tongue sometimes (something about out of the heart the mouth speaketh).  The One who said ""Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgement"" is the only One who has a right to pass that judgement. Still the word is there and I believe parents who are trying to teach their children not to curse have a right to know this.

This movie is absolutely a cut above any of the strictly secular movies because it delivers a message which is of real value.  Ignore the negative reviews and watch it for yourself; I think you will be glad you did.  Personally I believe the Bible is always right and ""the Rapture"" is the next great event on God's calendar.  Definitely recommended.",1421020800,,6513,4.49234693877551

It has a great story and well defined characters.  It also gave the message it was trying to.  That we need to be prepared for the Rapture/Tribulation.  In the original they explained things as they went along.  They spent a small amount of time on the plane and most of the time in the lives of the characters.

This new remake changed the whole story to make it exciting.  The characters were shallow and they just believed on a whim.  The original message was practically non-existent.  The majority of time was wasted on ridiculous, trivial discussions and arguments among the passengers.  They took a best selling story and massacred it.

Whether you're religious or not, I think many people agree that the story of the books, particularly the first five, is REALLY good.  I can't understand why the director of the movie focused almost solely on the immediate aftermath of the Rapture, as it pertained to trying to land a plane.  This was a plane movie more than a Rapture movie.  The monotonous scenery aboard the plane was very B movie-esque.  And Nick Cage pretty much phoned in his dialogue.  He delivered every line like a rehearsal rather than a performance.  I guess he was just as bored with it as I was.  If you're really interested in this topic, please just read the books.

One of the main things I really liked about the movie was their effect of people disappearing during the Rapture. It was far superior to any other movie I've seen. No one else has captured the effect in such a dramatic way and in the blink of an eye.  There are some movies which depict the event slowly where people slowly change into light and then stream upwards. Such effects may look pretty but it's not according to scripture. Jesus said it would happen in the ""twinkling of an eye"".  Meaning, as fast as you can blink your eye, the people would be gone.

I couldn't tell if it was poor acting or just bad writing. I suspect it was a bit of both. The plot unwinds slowly and predictably. I expected there to be more to the story. The entire movie felt like a prelude to several more movies which likely will never be made due to poor box office performance. It never arrives at a story. It just unfolds as ""in the event of rapture, these things may happen."" The conflict between the believers and non-believers comes across as an ""I told you so"" kind of argument. There is no humility in the ""Christian"" characters. The pastor that is left behind feels like a very underdeveloped character and also has me questioning some of the theology of the content. If it's meant to convince non-believers, it only pushes them further away. If it's meant to provide hope for believers, it falls short there too. There are so many things wrong with this movie from a production, writing, acting and theological standpoint. It's not worth wasting your time.",1420588800,2,1128,4.673366834170854

6722913,5,B00O5AJRAU,"Unbelievable movie!  Got it today and eagerly watched.  Honestly, I've had a rough week and this movie left me with the feeling, ""Things aren't THAT bad!""

Nicolas Cage is a real treat on-screen.  If you watch the extras, bonus videos and interviews, everyone raved about what a professional he was.  It was nice to see other familiar faces, like Lea Thompson, as well as some fresh faces, like Cassi Thomson and Chad Michael Murray.  The abundance of extras on the DVD is terrific.

This promised to be an action-packed movie and did not disappoint in that regard.  However, the pleasant surprise is the emphasis on families.  In a crisis situation, people tend to remember (or grieve the loss of) loved ones.  This aspect was well-developed in a variety of characters with very different backgrounds.  The importance of families and relationships shines throughout the movie.  That is refreshing.

There is too much to say here.  However, I will add that I waited a long time to see this movie.  Alas, I had no way of knowing exactly when it would be available on DVD after it first came out.  Sometimes, when you know something will eventually happen, you just have to wait until it really does happen.  In the case of Rapture and Tribulation, understand now that it really will happen even if we don't know exactly when.  Even so....maranatha.",1420502400,2,1347,4.807860262008734

I am not a fundamentalist Christian and I'm skeptical about the Rapture in general, but the books are well worth reading just for the story value alone, regardless of your personal religious beliefs.  This movie never gives you an opportunity to become invested in the characters, nor does it in any way define the Rapture, what the basic concept of the Rapture is, or follow any kind of story line that is cohesive or interesting.  I was hoping that this movie would be better than the Kirk Cameron version.  I know that Nicolas Cage hasn't done the work he certainly seems capable of doing in any recent movie I can recall, but I figured it would be worth a watch because he was in it.  There is a lot of ground to cover due to the subject matter, but I think this movie fails completely.  It's not that the acting is bad.  It just never covers any concept of what is happening and why it's happening.  It's not the worst movie ever made by far, but if you have read the Left Behind series and are hoping this one is worth a watch, I wouldn't recommend it.",1420416000,2,1118,4.336538461538462

6722919,2,B00O5AJRAU,"This is basically a remake of the Left Behind movie made a few years ago by Kirk Cameron; but the many problems in this film distracted me from enjoying the movie. Nick Cage as the pilot is an interesting choice - his non-caring attitude serves him well in this particular role as the non-believer pilot. So the problems for me started with the plane: when the plane leaves the terminal we hear the World's Shortest Pre-flight safety. And the flight was supposed to be leaving New York for London - looks a lot like Shreveport Louisiana, not New York. At 32 minutes in, the rapture happens. In the very first scene suddenly clothes are laying on the ground except for where Chloe is hugging her brother's clothes. cut to the plane then back to the mall; suddenly clothes are falling out of the air - what were people flying around the inside of the mall when they were raptured? And then there is the head-on collision, which asks us to totally suspend belief for a few minutes: The CAS (collision avoidance system) in Nick's brand new plane didn't take evasive action? (Okay, he did mention the computers were acting up) How about in the other un-piloted plane? And what about basic VFR rules that state that east bound flights fly at odd thousands plus 500 feet, while west bound flights are at even thousands plus 500? That should have ensured at least a 1,000 foot vertical difference. Okay, so folks who don't have basic flight school might not know these things, but you are still asking us to accept that the pilot-less plane randomly wandered about the sky and somehow managed a head-on collision with another jet in the mid-Atlantic?  (All those millions of cubic miles of airspace - what are the odds of them even occupying the same 1 mile cube, let alone the same 500' cube of airspace?)  In some of the rapture scenes the clothes appear to be dropped at head level or higher into the camera shot - really? in this day and age of CGI you can't do something more realistic? For a movie about The Rapture, it is poorly explained and the movie seemingly ends with a happy ending despite what comes next...

Chloe Steele (Thomson) is on her way home to see her mom when she sees her dad Rayford (Cage) at the airport. He tells her he is piloting a plane to London and the two argue. While flying, passengers vanish into thin air and everyone wants answers. Back on Earth the same thing is happening all over and no one knows why. First thing I have to say is that I have never seen the Kirk Cameron movies or read the books so I cant compare this to those. Also many of you know how I feel about Nicholas Cage so that will play a role in this review. I do have to admit this wasn't his worst movie and he didn't bug me as usual in this, but that is probably because he wasn't in it all that much. As for the movie itself, it was very cheesy and had the same aspects that most faith based movies do that bother me so much about them. When the rapture happens those that are believers will get called to heaven. After the good disappear it instantly becomes a free for all. Parents see their children vanish before their eyes and their first instinct is to start looting and take TVs and rob everyone they can. Movies like this have an unrealistic view of non-believers and that is why I am not a big fan of these faith based movies. Overall, all that said though this wasn't as bad as I was expecting.

The characters were believable, and there were humorous moments that were well placed to break a bit of tension just like some people tend to handle overwhelmingly stressful moments in life. I felt the movie was made on a level to appeal to people who are not believers and it showed clearly how many unbelievers think of believers without having in depth knowledge of the faith. I got the sense that this is a 'breakthrough the walls of peoples' hearts' movie to make them stop and wonder if this is what the future might hold and what would they do. The movie is effective in that sense. I have not quite understood all the criticisms from some Christians who have shown their expectation that the movie would be giving the full gospel message up front in the film.

6722961,3,B00O5AJRAU,"In trying to locate a movie quickly to watch on a Friday night, I stumbled upon this one at my local Red Box.

I grit my teeth seeing that Nicholas Cage was in it as well as the fact that it had biblical undertones.  I am not opposed to either Nicholas Cage or biblical undertones fully; its just that I've found Nicholas Cage can be hit or miss and many don't do the biblical 'stuff' well when it comes to movies or television.  Long gone are the Ben Hur,  Ten Commandment or King of Kings days of yore with their lavish sets, veteran actors/actresses and impressive narration (""Noah"" with Russell Crowe being the most recent exception).

Having said that and not having read any of the ""Left Behind"" series (though I remember when they were a big hit some years ago), I was pleasantly surprised by the story, the acting and the overall direction of Left Behind.  I felt the movie's continuity was strong and the underlying message was a good one.  I found it relatively mild - not overly preachy at all, though I've read others' reviews who didn't like it specifically for that reason, with some saying the book had much stronger religious overtones.

6722971,3,B00O5AJRAU,"This film plays a bit like Airborne (Mark Hamill), only with a Christian rapture approach instead of a South American death god angle. Most of the film takes place on a plane, at an airport, or on a runway. People disappear or die and everyone is in a panic to survive and figure out what has happened. Of course we know it's the rapture because of the book it's based on and there are some so-called spiritual kooks who clue us in early on, but based on the disappearances and how they happen no one really knows what caused them, not even the viewer. Could be alien abductions or something else. I'm not familiar with the books but it seems like many more films will be required to understand what will be happening with these characters as they get some concrete evidence as to what happened to their disappeared loved ones. Personally I think a film like this should be as ambitious as The Lord of the Rings trilogy depicting a heavenly realm with some angels like the Elves in LOTR and a hellish realm with a Sauron-like character upfront. Leaving it sort of vague like this initial film makes it like ""hmmm, could be rapture, but it could be some weird new virus, or maybe it was just a lot of spontaneous combustion or even something caused by global warming"". We all know what it is supposed to be about, so why hold back on depicting God, Jesus, or even Lucifer or the Antichrist? Either way, it was an okay start to what could grow to be more interesting, but chances are it will need another reboot. We'll see. Anyway, most of the stars I gave this film are for one of the best performances from Nicolas Cage that I've seen in a while, he really elevates this film playing a very believable airline pilot.

Having seen the original version with Kirk Cameron as star reporter and Brad Johnson as Captain Steele, the similarities and differences were interesting. The main characters and plots were mostly the same. The settings and props--from Steele's house, Chloe's rendezvous with her Dad and meet-up with star reporter Buck Williams, the rapture scene, how the steamy relationship between Captain Steele and fight attendant Hattie, etc.--were all new. The intense moments of crisis including those between daughter and mother, the long, unwinding crisis between flight crew and passengers as well between passengers, and the interplay between an inevitable crash landing and Chloe's heroic success in finding, clearing and lighting a make-shift runway made the movie worth watching. Considering the Christan message of the world crisis of the Second Coming of Christ is central to the story line, new scenes that included a Muslim man portrayed in a very positive light was an interesting turn.",1420156800,,1063,5.448484848484848

6723005,4,B00O5AJRAU,"Leaving aside any and all theological discussions let's just review this based on what it is.  What it is - a work of fiction by 2 evangelicals detailing the story of those left behind after the Rapture.  I know the theology.  I know all of these interpretations are bunk.  But there's a long line of works in the apocryphal genre and I must say I tend to enjoy them all.  You don't have to be a believer to enjoy a good bible story.

Of course we start with a comparison of the cinematic version of the books -There were 12 books in the original series and I kind of lost interest in the middle of the 12th, Glorious Appearing, as it was just too preachy for my taste.

This weekend was also History Channel's version.  Besides the fact the History Channel can't tell the difference between history and Pawn shops and truly does offer up nonsense 24/7 - this series was particularly annoying because the listed times were never correct so my DVR was getting trash pickers, pawn stars and some other redneck hunting/fishing/treechopping nonsense but for the few hours of the show, it was remarkably bad.  It's hard to fit 14 years of hell into an hour and a half without leaving out everything that makes sense.

Then we had the Kirk Cameron version which was just as useless and poorly acted as one would expect from anything featuring Kirk Cameron.

This is Nicholas Cage's version and it was surprisingly good considering it took a whole movie to tell the story that's covered in the first few chapters of the first book of the series.  At this rate it WILL be the second coming before they even make it to book 3.

This version had everything the Kirk Cameron version lacked.  Good acting, good writing, good cast and I was left wanting more.  So considering reviewing this is like reviewing a book based on the first chapter only I'm going to give it the  4 stars.  If you're a fan of the series you're going to feel, like I did, that you want to see this cast play out the rest of the series.  If you're not familiar with the franchise I'm not sure what you'll thnk because you won't have anything to compare it to.  And I think for those folks they may want to wait until a few more sequels have come out otherwise their reaction may very well be one star and a feeling it all just kind of went nowhere because, in fact, it does go nowhere.  It didn't go far enough into the story to make anything shown make sense because there was no context.

They have worked together so far and so it seems the human spirit will prevail once again like in ""The Perfect Storm"", ""2012"" and ""Armageddon"". This movie is a clear indication how biblically illiterate this generation is. There is no reason to turn to the Lord if we are able to accomplish everything on our own. But, if you believe what the Bible teaches that God is the Creator of this world, that He created mankind and gives them breath, that He is worthy to be worshipped, that He is holy, that He has a standard that must be kept, that the penalty for breaking that standard is eternal separation from God, that Jesus Christ is the only sacrifice that atones for sin, that there is a reckoning for those who do not believe Jesus, than you must be moved with reverent fear to believe and repent.

This film manages to show how the lost react to the saved (wich is the main vain of the series) at the same time show you how people react in a real world sense. The acting is done honestly which is good for this series if they continue making the rest. It pulled on my strings a little bit when it showed the preacher. The film shows us the importance of true belief and real faith. Music is done very well. The camera visuals are clean unlike most faith based films, great CGI and I am not really a fan of computer graphics but this is done well. I am glad to see this niche market grow larger, most of these types of films are not this well done. I hope to see more faith based films in the future.

First if anyone cared to look up this director's history. You would see he has barely made a few unknown films on his own and most of his career was spent as a stuntman. Which leads me to believe he must of hit his head one too many times to direct this garbage. Secondly did the writers even try to read the first book. The entire movie is only based on the characters of the series and not the story. Because in this version everything is completely twisted and added stuff that wasn't even in the book series. I read the entire series myself for what it is, reading entertainment. Another end of the World scenario and with what I thought would have been better actors and a bigger budget would have surpassed the other films that were made. What I found was a comical remake of the movie AIRPLANE loosely based on the Left Behind Novel. The characters on the plane were so ridiculous that I was actually laughing out loud watching this junk. Easily Minus 5 Stars Hands Down!",1419724800,9,1102,4.354368932038835

They tried to make this into an intense ""in-flight emergency"" movie (complete with a druggie, a stereotypical ""Islamic"" looking man who was actually the nicest, sanest person on the plane, and the token small person for comic relief) but instead it was just laughable.

We get two ultra-sexy vixens gasping and heaving for breath as they try to survive the apocalypse. Nicolas Cage is good as the sinful airline pilot and the final crash landing is super-exciting and cool. The kid who disappears inside his clothes is a neat special effect. But I don't understand the premise of this so-called 'Rapture'...WHY are all children raptured? I thought Christians believed that humans are born with 'Original Sin', so why would all the kiddies be pardoned without having converted to Jesus? Is this story saying that the 'Original Sin' concept is irrelevant? If so, then wouldn't we all be better off being aborted at birth so we could go to paradise immediately? I mean, according to these religious folks, we are all going to be in deep do-do unless we get put to death before we turn 12 years-old because God hates pubes. He adores the smoothness of the kids, but goes seriously ape-s*** on anyone foolish enough to become a teenager. (Maybe this is why adults are now waxing and shaving off all their pubes, but I kind of doubt you can fool Big G with this transparent deception.)

What I'm not as used to is feeling sorry for American Christians, but with this ""Left Behind"" movie, I don't know how else to feel. I was fully prepared for God to look like a jerk, which is the only way to view a being who would pull this ridiculous and cruel stunt on his creation, but what I was not prepared for was what jerks the CHRISTIANS appeared to be. Especially the prickly, brittle, ill-prepared woman at the airport who accosted the famous journalist character and confronted him with her version of end-times witnessing. Really, lady? You want me to join YOUR team, so I can be creepy and rude, too? (And I'm not saying that everyone who warns people of a perceived threat is creepy and rude--it can be an act of supreme love, however factually misguided--but this woman was a shrill, pinched little harpy).

And then there was the pastor who didn't really believe, and the mother who drove her family apart because she ignored the scriptural advice to be ""as harmless as doves and clever as serpents. In fact, the only religious person who came off looking good was the Muslim man on the airplane who offered to help a little person put his luggage in the overheard compartment, and was calm, prayerful, and generally cool through the disaster phase of the journey. Every other religious or ostensibly religious person I can recall was awful. But they, along with children, got raptured away, while the decent Muslim got left behind, because Muslim. Ohas to the babies in the nursery that were all missing, I guess we can assume God learned his lesson from the last such judgment, when in The Flood he just drowned them along with everyone else.

And so the content. On to execution. I am very entertained by the five-star reviews. Not by any stretch is this so much as a three-star movie. If you just LOVED the content because your view of divinity and judgment really is that warped and twisted, I can see maybe giving it two stars. But the script, the acting, even the vaunted production values, are so substandard that if this were an episode of NCIS youd wonder what on earth HAPPENED to the show.

The best part of the movie was the part that reminded me of the original Airport. I won't say more because while this is Holy Crap, even it doesnt deserve that kind of spoiler. But do keep in mind, this movie ARRIVES spoiled. It really is a rotten piece of work, and apart from that one brief action sequence, the only thing good I can say about it is that its an amazing argument against biblical literalism and fundamentalism.",1419379200,14,2723,4.575819672131147

Especially impressive was Cassi Thomson's character, Chloe.  She is angry at her mother for converting to ""born again"" Christianity, and bringing the divisive spirituality into the family.  Her father (Cage, playing Rayford Steel) runs away from his wife emotionally, and through extra work on the job.  Chloe understands, because the religious thing is irritating, and kinda crazy.  He begins a flirtatious relationship with a flight attendant, and the chemistry here is clearer and more believable than either the first movie or the book presented.

Some Christians might argue that this movie is too believable--that the skeptic arguments are too well presented.  For me, though--as a Christian minister--and movie lover--I like the changes.  This store feels like a real movie, rather than a church-produced screen play.

Most of the movie happens on the plane; in the first book the plane part hardly makes up part of a chapter. There's so much more to ""Left Behind"" the book that they could have fit in, especially with the introduction of Carpathia and Buck's travels to Israel.
The plane landing was a good added touch to the end. I can't get over how much of the book to movie was ruined.

It's difficult to decide whether the script or the acting is worse, but I vote for the script -- the dialogue is so wooden it's hard to imagine any group of actors turning the material into recognizable human behavior.

Anyway, It was really good! the movie had a more modern feel and approach to what might have happened if the rapture took away pilots from planes, and how communication was jammed, and how the planes would have landed with all the wreckage and traffic jams. And I liked how Nicholas Cage handled being a pilot, and the way he controlled the situation. They danced over that in the first book. It made the movie feel more real. I look at the world differently now because of this movie.
I know some Christians complained at how little they mentioned Jesus. I wish they would stop nagging. You don't have to mention Jesus to get the point across! The movie was meant for people not saved, because they're the ones the rapture will leave out. The message conveyed was Christian enough for me, God took the real Christians, everyone who was a faker or who did not believe in God was left. Jesus often didn't tell people who he was when he was on the earth, he didn't get all preachy all the time, he came down to man's level. I was relieved that it wasn't preachy, it becomes cheesy when they do that. And this is only the first movie, we'll likely get more of a Christian prospective in the next film and I look forward to that one too.
And I know some complained that they showed too much of the plane but I thought that was cool. I honestly thought they were able to land too easily in the book, they were very realistic in the disaster consequences on a plan. It was a good, interesting modern version. Far better then the Kirk Cameron films, which i'm sorry but I laughed my head off at. This one had drama, emotions, and it felt more real. I am already a Christian and i read my bible more often because of this movie.
I had problems with the first Left Behind book and the Kirk Cameron film because they were written by older people with outdated language and it really didn't click with me. This movie was much better! And to me the acting was really good. The extras were cheesy, but who cares. Jordin Sparks was the cheasiest actor in the movie but she is a singer not an actor.

If it had been on TV I would have shut it off in the first fifteen minutes.

If there's anything movies like this, and shows like The remnants, or whatever it was, show us; it's how bleak and screwed up the christian religion is.

I mean, I watched the entire first season of that show, but I was constantly asking myself why. It was better than this movie at any rate. But it was dark and depressing.

What I DO NOT want from my movies is having religion forced down my throat. If sitting at the dinner table with preachy relatives who constantly ask you if you've been saved and look at you with an expression of love that just barely masks sadness because they feel you're going to burn in hell annoys the piss out of you; don't watch this movie. You'll hate it. It's basically an attempt to brainwash you into believing for fear of being LEFT BEHIND. *cue cheesy music... DUN DUN DUN!!!* Not to mention some of the acting was kind of crappy. Not from Cage, though. But, the whole plot of the movie? The message throughout?  What they're trying to drill into your head until the credits roll and the movie blissfully ends? BELIEVE or you'll get to stay here on earth and suffer... Oh yah, and probably burn in hell is in there somewhere.

6723206,5,B00O5AJRAU,"This could well be the most important film Mr. Nicholas Cage will ever make.

If the film seems unreal to you as it begins, join the club. This Christian reviewer believes in the Rapture, and has published two books supporting the prophecy, the second an extensive examination of its' imminent fulfillment.

It is therefore a privilege and pleasure to review a Hollywood production dealing with this unplumbed prophetic reality.

""Left Behind"" grapples with a prediction coming directly from the Bible, a book that has never missed on any prophecy it has ever proclaimed. Because this ""...twinkling of an eye..."" could happen at any moment in our 'now.'

As Cage's character says in one scene, ""This is not about you or me.""

Based on the blockbuster books of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, and the films that followed suit, this latest version is even more compelling than the initial flurry of ""Left Behind"" proclamations.

What seems like eons back in our movie-saturated lives, was in fact only a couple decades or so. But then, who keeps track of time anymore, anyway?  Only ancient historians, and who listens to them?

For life is truly 'swifter than a weaver's shuttle,' as intoned by Job nearly four millennia ago.

That the early public response did not mirror the usual Hollywood gi-tacular receptions, Jesus was not elected the Mayor of Jerusalem either. His Word, as His Book, only skyrocketed after He came out of the grave.  ""After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep."" {I Cor. 15:6, NIV}]

Cage was asked why he was doing this film in one interview before the release of the picture. He replied, ""Because I never thought about this before.""

This film won't convince you to believe in Jesus by itself. In fact you're going to have to listen and watch very close to even find a Bible thread in the story.

But while you're eating dinner at your local dine-in theatre, watching the story unfold, you are going to think about it too. This story isn't based on truth, it is based on The Truth.

6723207,2,B00O5AJRAU,"Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is a smart college student coming home to see her family. Unfortunately dad (Nicolas Cage) is a pilot who has to work and has a hot date with a stewardess (Nicky Whelan). Dad and daughter meet at the airport and discuss how they must be supportive of mom (Lea Thompson) who is more far gone than stage four cancer...she has Jesus!

Thirty minutes into the film and BAM! The rapture happens and it seems the people who really held this world together were not secular after all, but raptured Christians...except for cheating pilots, stews, EMTs, news casters, and midgets. Nice to know that after the rapture, the circus and Fox News will still be the same.

After the rapture we are all concerned...will the father unite with her daughter? How will they cope knowing their two missing family members are in heaven...and HEY! We just had the rapture! Who cares about two characters we never got to like in the first place? Boring.

The film lost its entertainment value after the rapture and maybe that is the real metaphor here.

6723208,5,B00O5AJRAU,"Left Behind is a very popular series of Christian novels about the end of the world, based on a literal interpretation of the Bible's books Daniel and Revelation.  The idea of a ""Rapture"" in which every Christian and every small child (who is too young to choose a life of rebellion against God) gets teleported away from the earth comes from the apocalyptic discourse by Jesus in Matthew 24:  ""For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.  For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be.  Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.  Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.""

I find that the New Testament considers the 2nd Coming of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, the ""rapture"" of Christians into heaven, and the judgment of every human who's ever lived, a single event, sometimes called Judgment Day or ""the day of the Lord"".  I don't subscribe to the ""end times"" sequence of events that the Left Behind series is based on (though I understand how that interpretive view can be found from a literal interpretation of Daniel and Revelation).  However, with a great script, which I feel this 2014 Left Behind movie has, the story, which most people would find downright ridiculous, serves as an agency for exploring important themes.

I saw the original Left Behind movie when it was released in 2000 and saw it again just before seeing this new (2014) one starring Nicolas Cage.  This one has much better production quality than the original.  I think it was a good decision to make this movie more focused on characters, unlike the original which tries to get the audience to follow a complicated international plot to create an oppressive world government under an ""Antichrist"".  That will surely come later in this new series, so I reserve judgment on how this series will handle that material, but I was really pleasantly surprised at how the first movie of this series used the ""Rapture"" story to delve into important discussions about who God is.

The earlier one had three huge flaws:  1) Impossible to follow its international conspiracy story, 2) Focused on a series of events but not developing the characters, so that it feels like they're just acting out their scenes but not really exploring ""How would this kind of catastrophe really affect a person?"", because the script doesn't let them explore psychological struggles enough, and 3) Laughable transition of the UN Secretary-General into the Antichrist.  (It was so implausible as to be laughable, how Nicolae, the UN Secretary-General, goes suddenly from being very reasonable and kind to being a control-freak who says he will dictate all world affairs.  That is a hard plot development to make believable, and the first version did a terrible job at it.  The only character change I've seen that's equally implausible to watch, of going from really nice to suddenly being really evil so that it feels like two completely different characters, is the suitor Hans on Frozen.  Hans and Olaf the snowman were the characters I thought cheapened that movie.)

In each of those 3 areas, this new version has avoided the weakness of the first version, in that it:  1) Doesn't go up to the point of international conspiracy, but instead focuses on surviving the Rapture crisis, 2) Spends about half the movie developing the characters as the Rapture crisis hits Nic Cage and his daughter and her new boyfriend, and 3) (Not relevant, because the Antichrist isn't in this first movie.)

The structuring of the movie reminded me some of Star Wars Episode 3, in which several characters who are going through intense crises are experiencing almost identical things at the same time, both in plot elements and in changes of attitude.  Its balance of external intensity and brooding decision-making is also like Episode 3.  Key moments in Nic Cage's character's faith crisis and his daughter's faith crisis are happening at the same time, while Cage is on the plane and his daughter is back at home surviving the scare of driverless cars ramming into buildings and her mother and younger brother suddenly being gone.

I know that a lot of people who see this won't recognize how difficult it is to make a movie that's thought-provoking but which doesn't feel like a ""message movie"".  I agree with Cage that it is an excellent script.  I couldn't have been happier with how the script explored important ideas but served also as an entertaining action thriller.  The power of suggestion--looking at a verse in the Bible or asking a question about whether God is a certain way, or disagreeing with a belligerent passenger on the plane--is a much more artistic way to handle it than verbalizing everything in a preachy way.  A movie like Fireproof which is specifically about a Christian theme can do that in a somewhat natural way, but not a story like this, which I would call a Christian fantasy because it expects you to accept a global supernatural occurrence.  Because I don't believe the ""end of the world"" will play out in this way, and most of the intended audience probably doesn't either, the movie has to have value besides just following a set of plot points that people are expected to be interested in.  A character-focused movie that explores themes was the right move to make, rather than pushing people to accept a certain interpretation of the Bible's ""end times"".  The script in this and Cage's acting hit the mark very well in accomplishing that goal (of shifting the emphasis toward exploring themes and character changes).

I absolutely love how Cage performs the role of the pilot who cares about his family but is moving toward adultery and struggling with his view of God, and how he changes.  Some people on the internet have complained that he doesn't use enough emotion, but I think it adds power to his performance when he has to keep his emotions under control at all times as the pilot.  He is an excellent actor.

Vic Armstrong, the stuntman who doubled for Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, directed this, and he really knows how to handle action scenes.  The chaotic responses feel much more real in this than in the original Left Behind movie.  In the original, there's an unnatural easiness in transitioning from the Rapture to life after the Rapture.  In this version, everyone is in continual chaos/mass panic, trying to figure out whether it was an alien abduction or what, and it does justice to how such a crisis would affect large groups of people.  Part of the credit goes to the big budget and part of it goes to Vic Armstrong.

I encourage you to try it even if you think the premise is absurd.  As I've said, I don't believe God will teleport people and driverless cars will crash into buildings.  The supernatural premise of the Rapture probably annoys people mainly because it seems like an awful thing for a good God to do, but I'd encourage you not to let that interfere with enjoying the movie.  Instead of ""blaming"" God for the Rapture's catastrophic effects, the movie adroitly operates under the premise of ""This was prophesied in the Bible--we needed to heed it and seek God!""  The Rapture becomes the basis for the many crises of the series, but not something which people are supposed to analyze to death, any more than they analyze ""Why does this character keep getting lucky?"" in a comedy.  It's just the way things are, in the same way it's assumed that a Jedi's power can override gravity in Star Wars.  The supernatural is intended to be an accepted part of the story.

I consider it a fascinating idea to explore:  How would you react if that were to happen?  Think of it as if it's a sci-fi or fantasy with a basis in truth:  What if God did judge the whole world for its sins?  Is God just for doing so?  The movie explores those kinds of questions.  It has relevance to natural disasters, too, though most viewers will probably not take their thinking to that level.  While it's unwise to assume that major natural disasters are God's punishment, shouldn't we be evaluating whether we're ready to meet our Maker when natural disasters come, while also praying for relief and doing what we can to prepare for and prevent future ones?

Far from force-feeding religious conviction down the audience, this asks the audience to consider what matters most during disasters, and grounds it in the human familial relationship of Nic Cage with his daughter, and his daughter with her new boyfriend, who is an investigative journalist.  If you see it with the mentality that this is a vehicle for exploring themes, rather than forcing a certain view of the ""end of the world"" down your throat, I think you will enjoy it.  The reviews I read on the internet complained primarily about the Rapture IDEA, without considering the skill with which the script moves the characters toward greater faith and commitment.  I encourage you to give it a try.",1413331200,11,9171,4.728472658705217

I've seen a lot of Left Behind knockoff movies, as well as a great number of other Christian-themed films. Some of them are very uplifting. Some are just boring and preachy. Others just plain sucked. This one definitely falls into the latter category. Not only is the movie not uplifting, it doesn't even seem to take religion all that seriously. For example, try counting how many times you hear the name Jesus Christ in the movie. I did. It appeared exactly ZERO times. How does a movie that is supposedly based upon the New Testament manage to go 90+ minutes without a single mention of Christ? It really blows my mind when I think about it.

Nic Cage seems to really be phoning in his performance here. There is nothing special about it as compared with the rest of his movie catalog. Most of the rest of the cast is equally unconvincing. There are a lot of really stupid and unconvincing actions by the main characters. Honestly, I started giving up on the movie as soon as the ""rapture"" scene ended and I knew that all of the characters remaining were going to hell anyway. I hope that isn't considered a spoiler, but I'm assuming that most people know what is going to happen going into this film just based upon the title.
