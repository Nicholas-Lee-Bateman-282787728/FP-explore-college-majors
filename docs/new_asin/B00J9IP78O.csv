6347193,4,B00J9IP78O,"Izuru, Asagi, Kei, Tamaki, and Suruga are a group of genetically engineered teens who were raised and trained to be pilots of giant robots. Sadly, they suck. At school they have earned the title ""Fail Five"" and despite plenty of enthusiasm, they just generally make a mess of things. But when they are chosen to pilot units called AHSMB (Advanced High Standard Multipurpose Battle Device), the discover that it is possible for they to overcome their weakness and save the planet from the aliens that are attacking it.

I am not really a fan of mecha, but I'll watch mecha shows if it contains more than cool robots. I started this show expecting to drop it after a few episodes of mindless entertainment. Strangely, I kept watching. I think I was really hooked when the PR campaign started. Suspending disbelief a bit about teenage pilots carrying the fate of the world, the series did a decent job of handling the situation realistically. Sometimes you do need to do a little PR, sometimes you have to raise money where you can, sometimes constantly risking your life will cause stomach problems. The aliens' reason for attacking was interesting, as was the explanation for their incredibly human appearance.

The space battles were excellently animated and fun to watch. Normally the fighting is where I start zoning out in mecha shows, but I actually looked forward to the battles in this show most of the time.

I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It isn't all awesome though - I found Tamaki incredibly annoying and sometimes the story goes a little slow - but it was great entertainment. Of course, great entertainment doesn't necessarily mean it was a great series, so I won't be recommending it to my friends as a must watch, but for someone looking for a fun space/mecha show, this one should fit the ticket.",1397001600,8,1815,4.810897435897436

8649063,2,B00J9IP78O,"The episodes were dubbed, but not in the way I hoped. Sure, some of the actors did a good job, even some from Funimation & A.D.V. Films (God rest their souls) popped by to help, but important characters like Simon, Suruga, and even Izuru made me feel uneasy. The voices were poorly picked, I just didn't feel that connected with the characters' emotion and realism. And Tamaki's an idiot, why does she sound so sophisticated in the dub? And Monica Rial should've done someone else, Tamaki's Japanese voice sounded like a cute little hampster, so an English actor should sound somewhat similar, maybe Hilary Haag next time...

I would much prefer the characters to be dubbed by English actors from the Gundam and Inuyasha series, or even Funimation, but for now, THIS is what we have.

The rest of the series was great, and voices like Asagi, Kei, and Teoria should be kept in the series if it ever gets re-dubbed.",1419984000,,913,4.6645962732919255

8649067,5,B00J9IP78O,"I just finished watching this series and I absolutely loved it.  I will try to give a summary and my review without giving away any spoilers, so here it goes.

SUMMARY:
In the future man kind is at war with a group of space aliens.  Not much is known about the aliens and the war is not going well.  There is an academy that trains the next generation of pilots and there we meet our main characters.  The rabbit team is made up of five teenagers and they are better known as Fail Five because they are pretty much incompetent.  Therefore, it is a surprise when the team is called to action and put in the newest weapons.  The series follows our heroes in their many adventures.

I will leave it at that.  This series reminds me of Gundam SEED (future, fighting robots), but it does not take itself nearly so seriously.  Overall, this is an action anime, but I would also classify it as a comedy.  I was laughing a lot throughout this collection.  The collection is only 13 episodes long (so quite short) and there are a lot of unanswered questions at the end, but there is another collection due out in September so hopefully those questions will be answered in collection 2.  If you are a fan of mecha anime, then I highly recommend this collection.  If you are new to mecha anime, I think that this is a good way to get your feet wet.",1406592000,,1337,4.317269076305221
