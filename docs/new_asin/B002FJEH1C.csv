8369080,3,B002FJEH1C,I can't get this to work in my DVD player... it's a Blu Ray player but that shouldn't stop it... so I haven't been able to watch it.  ;-(,1431302400,,137,3.7241379310344827
8369081,5,B002FJEH1C,"Watched ""Sarah Squirrel's Great Adventure"" with my 15 month-old grandson Liam, and we both loved it and thought it was awesome! Loved the beautiful nature cinematography and I thought the piano background was really peaceful. The whole movie had a nice calming effect and it's such a nice change from other over-stimulating video alternatives kids have now. Your film is educational and entertaining without being over-stimulating. I loved it!",1390262400,,443,5.434782608695652
8369082,5,B002FJEH1C,"We were looking for a kids video that had actual animals in it rather than dancing, singing cartoons. Our two year old loves it. he loves seeing all the different animals and the buses and cars. I'm so glad I found this.",1307059200,2,220,4.261904761904762
8369083,5,B002FJEH1C,"I ordered Sarah Squirrel's Great Adventure as a gift for a friend who just had a baby but also has a two year old at home. I watched it and loved it's simplicity and nature video style. It is real video of live animals not cartoon format and it had enough other animals and firetrucks,etc to make it appealing to any young child. I have ordered more as gifts for some teachers I know and to have on hand for other friend's grandchildren...highly recommend it if you are an enjoyer of squirrels! My dogs even were glued watching which was entertaining in itself!!",1250208000,6,562,4.466019417475728
