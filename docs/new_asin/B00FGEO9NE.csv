5990962,5,B00FGEO9NE,"Homeland remains brilliant and unforgettable for me. I cannot say enough about it. From the writing to the directing to acting, it is seamless and unforgettable. We look forward to every new episode - it's full of surprises and I really like the complexities of the protagonist, Carrie.

I seldom watch television, but I absolutely love this show.",1382054400,3,347,4.982758620689655

5990964,1,B00FGEO9NE,Complain to Showtime lol.  Amazon just sells the product.  I would agree that the first two episodes were no good in my opinion.  Hopefully this series doesn't die like 24 did.,1381449600,9,176,4.612903225806452
5990965,2,B00FGEO9NE,"I'm a fan of Homeland and really enjoyed both season one and two. Season three has not lived up to the first two seasons so far. Dana Brody is my least favorite character in the whole show. I don't like her character and wish they would write her out of the program. They have given her way too much screen time in the first two episodes. I'm interested in Carrie, Brody, Saul, Quinn, and the agency and how it all plays out. I don't want to waste my time on Dana and her love life. Brody wasn't even in the second episode,they replaced him with Dana. If it continues down this path I'm not sure if I'm going to continue to watch it. I really like Clare Danes and Damien Lewis, they make a very interesting couple in the series.",1381363200,49,728,4.207142857142857

  Revised December 16,2013

  It was rough getting through the first 3 boring episodes of the season, then the writers and producer (Claire Danes BTW) kicked it up several notches with the plot to get inside Iran. The rest was as good as any spy thriller gets. The ending is surprising but well thought out and essentially completes the story. The ending seemed to be a closure for the stories of the main characters, with no cliff hanger.
  There were some distinct plot holes including why the Iranian forces didn't shoot Carrie on the spot, and how the Iranians would explain why their hero Brody would assassinate the head of the Revolutionary guard without suspecting a CIA setup. Also, why would Carrie, the loose cannon, be promoted to Bureau chief in a sensitive location,after her employers locked her up in a mental institution and later on had her shot on orders?  From their perspective, she would have  to be seen as unstable and untrustworthy.  Anyhow, the series could be complete here, and a fourth season would just be jumping the shark.",1381190400,,1083,4.895604395604396
5990967,1,B00FGEO9NE,"What a way to BLOW a compelling and intellectually stimulating franchise well thought out in Season's One and Two!! Have seen the first two episodes of season three and if I have to sit through another episode of Claire Danes acting Uber Neurotic and a teenage girl finding her 'sexual' self I may be compelled to put my foot through the television screen!! Hope they get back on track in episode 3 of Season 3 otherwise I'm out of here, let alone pre ordering Season 3.........you've got to be kidding!?!?",1381190400,37,506,4.633333333333334

It's not a region problem.  It's not scratched.  The return window closed because I was watching Season 1-2 that I ordered at the same time before we got to this one.  Those seasons played fine.

5991124,4,B00FGEO9NE,"Season one is still easily the best. Season two and three are both very good, but while I expected the ending to Season three, it was still shocking. Spoiler alert here to a degree. I always felt like Brody was the victim here. He could not help what happened to him, yet he has not been viewed in a good light by anyone except Carrie. She is the only one to realize his change was something beyond his control and by the time he was able to overcome his eight years of brainwashing and torture, it was too late for his redemption. Season three starts incredibly slow and seems to be going nowhere. But once Brody comes back into the picture and he is given his chance at redemption, the pace picks up dramatically and the second half of the season rivals Season one. As a former soldier who was in the first Persian Gulf War, I find this series mesmerizing, even during the slow parts. My own service may be the reason I have a soft spot for Brody. I just wonder how good Season four can be after the conclusion of Season three.",1437955200,,1029,4.282051282051282

While Danes is not a pretty crier, she does a hell of a performance filled with emotion and nuances that makes her character very real and complex. there are many things I like about the show: Great story, great acting, believable suspense and I think overall all comes together well. There are plenty of details on the side that while not distract me from the story, they enhance my interest in the show. I don't give it a five because this is not quiet True Detective quality.
Flaws: There are scenes supposedly shot in DC but they are not.",1426464000,,567,4.461538461538462

5991252,5,B00FGEO9NE,"As a former senior counterterrorism intelligence officer who has worked for and/or with all the national intelligence offices (DIA, CIA, NSA, DHS, etc.) at one time or another (and who has actually, as a side note, written a short non-fiction book on some of this subject matter), I can't recommend this series highly enough.

My friends often ask me, based on my experiences, how realistic this show is, amidst all the other ""spy"" shows available on cable. I can say, since Season 1, Homeland has been amazingly accurate in many ways, from intelligence collection methods to interagency cooperation (and, notably, the lack thereof, even after 9/11). This is the one show I can point to and say: ""this is actually how it's done!""

Now, of course, it's a Hollywood drama, and not a documentary, and all that entails. But, of all the shows that have attempted to pull this off, Homeland has easily proven to be the most accurate.

I also, just from a personal entertainment perspective, find Homeland to be a must-see cable series, alongside Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.",1422748800,,1073,4.884615384615385

I'm not quite done with that one yet.  Missing Brody.  He made the series ""pop"".  I have to say that I hate the drama with the daughter!!  With all of the F-Bombs on the show this isn't for teenagers.  So why are we subjected to so much nonsense with Brody's teenage daughter??  It detracts from the show and the plot in my view.  And for the record, since the writers use so many F-Bombs, the word has lost its impact and become a fizzle.  Can we cut out 2/3 of those, please?  Use your fabulous writing skills to make a more meaningful dialogue!  Their knee-jerk reaction is to have the characters say the F-word in almost every situation.",1419897600,,787,4.3310344827586205

5991345,3,B00FGEO9NE,"The first 2 seasons were riveting, Season 3 was no where close. It needed more time to wrap everything up. What got use hooked on season 1 and 2 was the family aspect and raw emotions. We the viewers needed more closure with the Brody family. We wanted to see that Brody was re-recognized as a war hero and to see his family breathe a sigh of relief and be able to get on with their lives again...especially his daughter. A presidential pardon, a news paper headline, followed by his families reactions....something more to tie this up would have earned them another star.
The other thing that got me was the constant conflict between Saul and Carrie, Saul was not acting like Saul this season. He did not have Carrie's back and kept second guessing her even though she has proven herself to him time and time again. I am not sure where Season 4 is going but they need to turn some things around if they want to get back up to the excellent plot and storyline of seasons 1 and 2 IMO.",1419033600,,983,4.3478260869565215

5991355,4,B00FGEO9NE,"+WARNING+ This will contain spoilers from the prior seasons, and some hints, but no major give aways about season 3.

The third season is good, but kind of disjointed.  The plot lines seem to jump around until you get toward the end of the season where everything comes together.  The first half of the season was really about the aftermath of the CIA bombing at the end of Season 2 that was pinned on Brody.  An elaborate plan between Carrie and Saul was hatched to get the person responsible out in the open, but if you think about it too hard it was a plan hatched to catch someone they did not really know was involved with 100% certainly, relied on information they did not have when the plan was set in motion, or that the bait would be taken.  So it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to buy into the whole thing.  If you can put that aside however, the rest of the season is compelling and dramatic, much like the prior seasons were.

The other main point this season was the wrap up of Brody's story line.  For much of the first part of the season Brody was not even around or only appeared for most of 1 episode and a few minutes in a few others. Then his story converged on the other story line.  The one unfortunate part of ending that story is that the great story surrounding Dana's response to finding out her dad was a terrorist was also wrapped up, and it was pretty clear that his family will not have a large role in the show anymore.  That said, it was definitely time to bring that story, as good as it was for the first season and a half to a close.

As far as extras go, there is a behind the scenes feature on filming the final episodes, deleted scenes, commentary on the final episode, and a feature on Brody's story from the first part of the season.  Not a ton, but okay for what is there.  All in all, it is not as good as the prior seasons, but does an adequate job resolving some story lines and moving the show forward.",1418515200,,1954,4.206434316353888

The first couple of episodes will try your patience a bit and seem like we're going to get bogged down in more ""crazy"" Carrie shenanigans.  But by the 3rd episode things settle down and get moving and the results are compelling.  The show has evolved and maybe does not have the same edge as season 1 & 2 but is still far better than much of what's on TV these days.  If your worried the show has jumped the shark, I'd say not yet despite some serious character events that unfold.  I'm in for Season 4!",1418169600,,563,4.273584905660377

5991385,1,B00FGEO9NE,"I did not watch Homeland when it first aired on Showtime.  I have been catching the last few weeks.  I have felt from the beginning that this show is seriously flawed while at the same time offering some real intrigue and suspense.  But after watching 3 seasons I am asking myself if I want to waste my time anymore.

This show jumped the shark in season 1 but jumped more sharks in season 2.  Season 3 left me wonder if the people who write this nonsense are sitting in the cubicles laughing at us for watching their contrived lunacy.

To start, the lead character Carrie is not just bi-polar.  She act like a full blown psychotic.  Her constant facial expressions showing her about to fall to pieces and her subsequent outbursts are laughable.  This woman is supposed to be working for the CIA!  Does anyone seriously believe someone in the CIA could act so impulsively, be so insubordinate and actually commit so many felonies and still have a job?  At various points in the show she puts herself and others at risk of death and she keeps her job?  She has a relationship with a confessed terrorist which clearly clouds her judgement and she is not arrested and thrown in jail?  At one point she makes herself an accomplice the the murder of the vice president and says nothing to save the life of her lover - the terrorist!  This is all just so ridiculous it requires a total suspension of belief.  I can  understand if Carrie was a little insubordinate and a little eccentric, but she is way out in la-la land and it makes the show almost impossible to watch.  I don;t know is we are supposed to like Carrie or consider her a hero, but I have this burning desire to see her arrested, tried and hung for treason.

But let's get back to season 3.  For the life of em I do not understand why the writers of this show decided to spend so much time on a troubled, bratty teenage girl.  It takes so much away from the rest of the show and what the show is supposed to be about.  Honestly, teenage girls are a little crazy, which you know if you raised one.  But they are not interesting after about 5 minutes.  Yet almost every episode of season 3 spends half the time on this stupid, rotten little brat.  It made me miss season 1.

I have read season 4 calms everything down.  I hope so because after watching season 3 I need a good reason to take time out of my life to watch any more Homeland episodes.",1417305600,8,2404,4.334080717488789

To those who thought the show was all about Brody, and that he was the main character, and that there is no show without him  so sorry. It's great that they got such a fantastic actor for the role; I've been a fan since ""Band of Brothers."" But Carrie has been the main character from the start and always will be. This show is an amazing vehicle for an amazing actress. That said, the rest of the cast is amazing as well  Mandy Patinkin, Morena Baccarin, Morgan Saylor, F. Murray Abraham, and so many more.

It is one of those shows that leaves you on the edge of your seat to where you will sacrifice the sleep to watch another episode. I was putting off watching it and when I started I just simply could not stop. This show will unravel at an excellent pace and not be that hard to follow. You might have to watch some episodes twice, but you will love every second.

I will not play spoiler at all because this show is just too good and you need to watch it. Every single person I tell about this show furiously texts me thanking me for putting them onto it. I have friends who called out of work sick to watch 2 seasons in 4 days.

Homeland 1  despite all the reviews  left me a bit cold  but still interested , Homeland 2 raised the bar a  lot thus  I waited anxiously for Homeland  3 .
I have just  watched the whole of series 3 in two days : > ) love the twist in the story line , but a couple of issues , Brodys daughter , what was the point of all that time being wasted on her relationship with a fellow patient ? , when  the actual bomber was killed by an employee of Danesh Akbari lawer  there was no follow up on such an important issue?.

Over  all ,slightly dissapointing but hopefully Homeland 4  will raise the bar again .",1413244800,,670,4.10077519379845

5991517,5,B00FGEO9NE,"I read some of the other reviews that people wrote, and now, having seen all the episodes, I don't really see what people are complaining about.  Brody wasn't in many of the episodes because his storyline had completely changed--and was almost finished.  This season was really about Carrie and Saul, and about how the Brody family was dealing with the fallout of the Langley bombing.

I don't get why so many people were so hostile about Dana and her storyline...she's a fifteen-year-old trying to come to terms with the fact that apparently her father, her hero and the person she was closest to, decided to blow up 200 people.  How would you deal with such a thing??  I might slit my wrists, too.  She's Brody daughter, a major character in this show, and they aren't just going to forget about her.  I think what they wrote for her is great, and I think she's a fabulous actress, too.  If you can't deal with the storylines the writers have created for the characters, stop watching the show, because now that Brody is dead, I'm sure there's going to be more of the same.",1412640000,5,1075,4.5625
5991518,5,B00FGEO9NE,"After a powerful season 1 and 2, HOMELAND seems to lose itself in Season 3. The pacing is slower and we are led on a tedious journey that seems to go off in 37 different directions with countless characters. The meat of HOMELAND is the story of CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Clare Danes) and Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Damien Lewis), a former prisoner of war held by al-Queda for 8 years.
Season 3 begins with Mathison's mental issues returning and Brody being on the run as the suspect in a devastating bombing at CIA Headquarters. We return to our story and the intrigue of two lives intersecting. Brody's guilt and loyalties are always in question. There is a fascinating story that quickly becomes overwhelmed with side plots and lesser characters. Although any of the side stories would be interesting if fully developed, we are taken on a meandering plot that seems to spend several episodes going nowhere.
Brody comes back into the picture as a prisoner again in Caracas, Venezuela. The man never gets a break and Lewis plays his role with immense feeling and what appears to be an actual physical transformation as the man imprisoned again.
Although Season 3 is disappointing, no one can deny HOMELAND is filled with delightful and talented actors. Even lesser characters light up the screen as see a delightful blend of actors of various ethnic backgrounds.  A few stand outs are Tracy Letts as the power hungry Senator Andrew Lockhart, Nazanin Boniadi as Fara Sherazi a dedicated CIA analyst with longings for her homeland of Iran and especially Shaun Toub as the delightfully evil, murderous and unpredictable Majid Javadi, the Iranian Deputy Intelligence Chief.  Here are some wonderful actors finally displaying their skills, although maybe trapped in clichd terrorist-related roles.
Although slow moving, season 3 redeems itself in the last few episodes as the action begins and we know lives will be impacted and the world will be changed. We are in the world of espionage and deception as the season concludes. Loyalties and the truth are always in question. Expect the unexpected. The lovely city of Rabat, Morocco doubles for Tehran, Iran so expect some exotic and exciting scenery. The show is visually stunning so be prepared to be overwhelmed.
The last minutes of the finale take us back to our feeling of disappointment as the three seasons are tidily wrapped with a bow. It's clear at the end of season 3, that the next season of HOMELAND will be off in a new and fresh direction. We may be curious about Season 4 but nothing is left to entice us to continue with the series. Still, I'll be there for Season 4.",1412640000,2,2635,4.840354767184036

5991542,5,B00FGEO9NE,"Binged watched all 3 seasons of 'Homeland' in about a two weeks duration on DVD. Of course Season 1 and 2 were great, yet with all the excellent TV shows out there Homeland Season 3 finds it self at the apex (and ascending upward) where the excellent writing of ""Breaking Bad"" had acheived a few years ago. Ingenious plot twists, out of nowhere surprises, and horrific endings. The reasons? Maybe it was finally decreasing a large percentage of the Brody family epoch,  Brody out of sight, no more of the character named Director Estes screwing things up, and Saul finally able to work the reigns of the CIA at full gallop without numerous strings attached. The new bad guy Majid Javadi, was eerily haunting of another infamous sinewy character in history known as Gruppenfhrer Reinhard Heydrich, and just as cunningly proficient for subscribing to any favorable opportunity whatever the costs. Hitman Peter Quinn adds sense of shadowy iron resolve and able to enforce any mortal outcome without remorse, except for an ability to  forget the reason why his marriage fell into ruin.  The only shortcoming of Season 3 seemed to be the muddled plot/plight of Fara Sherazi, but her story may unfold more further in season 4.

5991546,4,B00FGEO9NE,"The action of the series is extremely dense and as such the series is interesting, entertaining, suspenseful. But it takes more than simple action to make a good series.

The first problem it envisages is the fact that a US soldier captured in Iraq or Afghanistan, kept prisoner for eight years and liberated as some kind of collateral incident of one particular raid on a Taliban or jihadist post, goes through debriefing and even lie-detecting without a hitch though he has been turned during captivity. Yet one CIA agent is suspicious but she cannot come to anything conclusive.

The whole story turns around the fact that this marine was turned or broken by his captors. The way they did it, and we learn right at the end it was decided by Iranian people directly under control of the security boss in Iran, is original and at the same time standard. First torture knowing that all the man says during the first seven or eight days is worth nothing because a marine is trained to resist torture for seven to eight days. Then he can say everything he knows, after eight days, because he knows that by then everything has had time to change or be changed. In other words torturing well trained elite fighters is useless since they will be speaking freely and the truth only the truth but after eight days during which all they had told was lies and prepared inventions in order to let their side change what has to be changed.

The second element is that after this torture that can only last a short time, you have to get the chap into total absolute isolation with rare moments of contact with the outside world and under perfect guidance. The prisoner will little by little get out of his mind and to keep some sanity he will turn to a god or some kind of spiritual or religious belief. Thats when the Stockholm Syndrome can hit hard on the prisoner. In that total loss of contact, perspective and connections with the world if some kindness is proposed by one of the captors, if possible one that has played a role in the torturing but not the direct torturing part, rather the commanding part in the torture, then the prisoner will become grateful and if this kindness goes on and increases the prisoner will naturally turn. His religious need will lead him to adopting the religion of his captors. In this case the prisoner is entrusted with teaching English to the son of the leading figure among the captors and this brings the prisoner into an emotional situation where he falls in love with the child, the young boy. At this moment the prisoner has become a member of a situation that makes him part of the captors world. The torture broke him and the kindness turned him.

It is then a US drone that kills dozens of children in a school, and among these children the boy whose education our prisoner had been entrusted with, that completes the turning of the man. Then the rest is detail. He becomes the willing live suicidal bomber that will kill those who are responsible for the bombing of the school, and that is the US Vice-President and his security outfit or team if you prefer.

The third element here is that this turning cannot be reversed but it can at first be blocked by small elements that come from his previous life, and in his case his wife and his children, particularly his daughter. You can turn a man but you cannot erase his past. You can block that past and train him so that he can go through any debriefing and any lie-detecting, but you cannot delete his past, and you must not because this past is what is going to make him able to go back to his society to fulfill his mission there. But this past contains emotions that are revived for some of them by his coming back to his previous life and that can block the resolve and mission of the turned prisoner. The film gives two cases and the same element, attachment to previous wife and children, is the blocking element, the emotion to which the two people go back to and that can become the stumbling stone. Turning a man is never complete because it is impossible. Thats what the series tells us.

It goes, in the last episodes of the third season, as far as showing the turned prisoner can first be turned all over again and back to what he used to be, a Marine, and then the mission he had been entrusted with when he was turned the first time can become the very incentive for fulfilling at any cost the mission he has been entrusted with when he was turned back to his initial Marine format, and the intermediary turning of the man by his captors will become the force that will motivate his vengeance or vengeful power which will lead him to fulfilling the second mission: he will eradicate those who turned him the first time out vengeance.

The second theme of the series is very debatable. To pretend that the present change in Iran is the result of a CIA opposition that liquidated the historical main security leader in Iran and had him replaced by a CIA undercover agent is simply absurd. This undercover CIA agent was the chief of security under the Shah and then became the second man in command of the security system under the ayatollahs. In other words he is a turn-coat. To pretend that he has embezzled great sums from his own security operations and hence from the regime in Iran is just foolish. It takes an embezzler to recognize another. Thats the type of tactics the CIA uses and they consider everyone does the same. Since the CIA leads the people they want to buy to embezzling money through their double-agent situation, they think it is natural for everyone to dream and desire to be an embezzler. Whats more to think that the evolution of Iran is nothing but secret service corruption and penetration and infiltration from the CIA is mental simplicity. The evolution of a country in any direction can only come from the people themselves if it is to be long lasting and serious. We seem to forget Hitler and Mussolini were elected. At that level the ideology of the Mossad (this series is adapted from an Israeli series) is so obvious that we wonder if the series is not financed by that Mossad.

The final remark I will make is that the CIA is using, at times at top level, people who are psychologically deranged or non-functional. Here the main agent in these adventures is a woman and she is bipolar, hence highly sensitive to any withdrawal from her drugs and she should not even be sent in hostile fields since she could be tortured by just being cut off from her drugs. Such motivations or abilities, I mean the abilities that are developed in such psychologically deficient situations, can be useful for some extreme situations but they are extremely dangerous in the long run because the person cannot be trusted.

And she sure cannot be trusted, so much that she can easily be manipulated including by the CIA in order to fulfill objectives she is not even conscious or aware of. This vision of humanity (man is nothing but a manipulated manipulating manipulator) is a denial of humanity itself. We can see what it may lead to with ISIS or Ukraine. In the first case Iran finds it easy to laugh at the West who actually financed the various movements that now have turned out to be ISIS. In the same case it does not take much from Putin to manipulate Ukraine back to some kind of a compromise after the Ukrainians (including the remnants of the nazi units that had managed to survive in the West as political refugees from the USSR and had come back to be the agents of the West, and particularly the European Community, after the fall of the USSR) had been manipulated into ousting the properly elected President during the Sochi Olympic Games.

If this world has any future it will only come from consensual properly expressed wills and desires of the mass of the people of every single and all countries in the world. Scotland is there to prove the point: in spite of all public opinion polls manipulated by the media to predict such a close result that they could not even tell which side dominated, the winning margin of NO was so wide that there cannot be any kind of doubt.

This series is typical of the new Cold War ideology that is developing in the West confronted to the fact that this West has lost the leading position in the world and the future is in the hands of the BRICS and their allies or partners. Who  apart from me and Ivan Eve, THE INDIAN OCEAN THE MARE NOSTRUM OF HUMANITY [Kindle Edition]  could have said four or five years ago that Sri Lanka was going to be the maritime hub in the Indian Ocean and whats more the security hub in this Indian Ocean. What this means is not clear as for the security hub, so far, but it is crystal clear as for the maritime hub with the latest announcement about the development of Colombos harbor.

This Cold War flavor is regrettable because the series is fascinating at many levels.

The circumstances of all the major characters in the first 4 episodes were so dire and apparently hopeless that I wasn't sure I was going to like it as much as I had enjoyed the first two seasons.  The producers had a lot to live up to after the first two seasons and I wasn't completely sure they were off to such a good start after watching Disc One.

A brilliant plot twist kicked Season 3 into a new gear beginning around the 5th episode, though, and incredible new plot twists and suspense followed all the way through to a completely unpredictable and shocking season finale that put satisfying ribbons on all of the major plot lines, introduced promising new plot lines, and left open the possibility of the reintroduction of unresolved minor plot lines.

The intelligence community in real life has been much maligned and criticized in the last 5 years.  This show does show the incredible sacrifices made to commit to this career field and the sacrifices are made so the rest of us can live day to day not worrying about attacks.  I can say as a former military spouse that after 9/11 we were saved from dozens of real plans to attack us on the homeland. Most people either don't know or have forgotten that in the short weeks after 9/11 when we went into the lion's den, underground facilities complete with arms, detailed plans for follow-on attacks, and the like were found...Our troops carefully captured so many real terrorists//or jihadi alive from whom we gained real intell to stop new attacks. When politics are put aside and the real security of our country and our allies is put as top priority, we are kept safe....I just hope this show keeps reminding people that there is a small group of committed foes who will stop at nothing for however long and at whatever cost in order to destroy us.

5991579,1,B00FGEO9NE,"SPOILER ALERT
After 2 excellent series, Homeland seriously loses its way during its 3rd year mainly due to the fact that all the main storylines were resolved by the end of season 2 and the show now has nowhere to go.
So let's have Carrie back in the nuthouse with her mental health problems and let's have Brody locked away from the world all over again. Talk about the writer's starting to repeat themselves - and it's only season 3 !
Worse than this, let's waste endless valuable screentime on dana brody, Homeland's equivalent of 24's kim bauer, ie the idiotic daughter who's got nothing to do with the main plotline, so let's keep coming up with more and more absurd storylines to justify her even being in the series at all instead of just dumping the irritating brat; or at the very least keep her in the background where she belongs like they did with Brody's son all season long !  Going on the run with her boyfriend only to realise she's with a complete lunatic - they've been using that tired cliche going all the way back to Terrence Malick's Badland's !
There was talk of killing off Brody at the end of season 2 by the writer's. You get the feeling they later regreted not making that call with the character because Brody quite clearly no longer has a storyline anymore - this goes some way to explain why the 2nd lead of the show is missing for more than half the season !
So what are we left with instead ?  Dr Geiger and the guy from Amadeus in rooms talking plot - what the hell is this, Death of a Salesman !
The final insult is the way the writer's bungle Brody's death, in fact it's so badly writen that for awhile I truly believed Brody was faking his death and was going to turn up alive and well in season 4.
Knowing he's about to die, why in his final conversation with Carrie doesn't he tell her he loves her and for her to take care of their baby ?
Brody's faith in Islam has always been on shaky ground, ie as a Muslim he commits adultery on his wife and downs bucket loads of alcohol - hardly the behaviour of one of the faithful ! Despite this I still believe Brody was genuine in his faith, so why as a Muslim knowing he's about to die don't we ever see him making his peace with Allah - even Saddam Hussein did that at the end !
Brody's entire death is just so badly written it's not ever a remotely credible potrayal of a man facing his end - as one of the central characters of the series he clearly deserved a more believable exit than the one he got !
All in all a tired, lazy and sad effort for a series that quite clearly has run out of steam - season 4 is no better in its lousy finale which cheats the viewer by refusing to resolve any of its storylines and instead ends with carrie reconciling with dear mumsy, a storyline so awfully cliched that even The Waltons would have thrown it out !
If this is the best the writer's can come up, have the decency to quit now and stop wasting the viewer's time once and for all !",1396310400,18,2962,4.1947368421052635

It has now been 2 years since season 3 was shown in the States and several months since the last episode of season 3 on UK TV and there is still no DVD! This must be the worst marketing of a product I have ever seen. I wonder just how much money the seller will lose from lost sales and preorder cancellations. I would not be surprised if season 3 is never on DVD at all.

5991582,4,B00FGEO9NE,"Like many people I loved the star crossed lover relationship between our bipolar CIA agent heroine Carrie Mathison with sloppy impulse control torn between her patriotism, and her unbridled attraction for the former marine Nicolas Brody kept captive for 8 years who might have been turned into a terrorist. By now you know what happened unless you like to put carts before horses, and season 3 begins with the aftermath of the major event of 12/12. Just when it seems like our two main characters might have a shot at a viable relationship, something always happens, like 12/12 bringing a Romeo and Juliet dimension to how the story unfolds.

Now it's all change at the CIA as Saul (played by Mandy Patinkin) takes over. Carrie starts off making yet another dubious decision and Brody has now taken on the new role of most wanted fugitive. Carrie seems to be going even more downhill in dealing with her illness, and politicking at the CIA place Saul and his protege at odds.

Homeland, according to IMDB has gained 35 wins from 57 award nominations winning Golden Globes Awards for Damian Lewis and Claire Danes as Best Actor and Actress, and also for Best television series.

You are probably wondering how does season 3 compare to seasons 1 and 2. Homeland set the bar very high in seasons 1 and 2 with brilliant acting and storytelling. Can the series sustain its own high standards? I cannot say that season 3 is better only different. If the first season was the season of Carrie and the second season was the season of Brody, then the third season is the season of Saul, who shows himself to be an incredible strategist who makes extremely bold strategic moves which carry their own risks and do not necessarily sit well with people in high places, and could have dreadful repercussions if they don't work out.

The program similarly takes very brave risks, so brave that one wonders where the series can go from here. There will be a season 4 which may seem surprising after what happens in season 3 which means the series has to entirely reinvent itself, and may indeed risk losing some loyal viewers because of choices made. But the creators of Homeland have surprised us in the past and I suspect will continue to do so.

I liked season 3, and I think if you're like me and were addicted to seasons 1 and 2 then you have no choice but to watch season 3. Once you start watching it you cannot not watch it all the way through no matter what happens, and plenty happens.

5991584,4,B00FGEO9NE,"Please not another scene with Saul and his wife!!!! Argghh - It's all I can do to keep from puking.  If Saul wants to get information out of enemy agents he should just make them witness himsef together with his wife for 5 minutes or more.  They'll be screaming out all State secrets long before that - - ""Make it stop!!! I'll tell you anything you want to know!!  Just please not another minute of you and your wife - - - please I'm going to be sick - - again - - arrggghh!!!!""

Saul is one of the better characters though, and apart from any scenes involving himself and his wife I usually like his character.

The guy who plays the replacing FBI director does a great job playing a real knob.  It takes a certain talent to be that much of an @$$#@!# and he did a great job.

I like to rag on this show (sorry, I can't help it), but actually, while there are quite a few overlong scenes (and this makes it great for simultaneously doing other things at the same time, checking back in long enough to get the main point of each overly-long scene), it does follow the same pattern of previous seasons in becoming fairly riviting by the end of the season.  Homeland is not a show I usually recommend to friends first as there are too many other better shows, and yet to be fair it's been a fairly entertaining watch as were previous seasons, and enjoyable for what it is.  Yet it's still about as believable and deep as that other guilty pleasure of mine: ""Revenge"".",1390521600,2,1465,4.278985507246377

Have patience and definitely pay attention. Claire Daines is wonderful and is even more central to events, if that were possible. She faces some tough choices but soldiers through. She is seemingly made a scapegoat for the CIA bombing and the time she spent with helping Brody get away after the bombing is called into question. Brody, played so well by Damian Lewis, is the world's most wanted fugitive  and must endure horrors while hiding out. Ultimately, he is given a chance at redemption.

The suspense and drama kept my adrenaline running. I cannot wait to see what season 4 brings.  Hopefully something to do with getting rid of the new CIA director.",1390262400,,429,4.071428571428571

Because Showtime doesnt want to ""end"" a successful series, it continues.  However, the third season reminds me of the guy who is stumbling to the finish at midnight in the Ironman Triathlon.

5991589,5,B00FGEO9NE,"Review of content.

It's clear from reviews here and in the UK press that many have been disappointed by season 3 of Homeland, no doubt because of the conspicuous absence of Brody for several episodes. But I want to make the case for this season. To me, this was where Homeland grew up and showed real grit.

Season 1 with its simple proposition of ""had-he-or-hadn't-he-been-turned?"" and ""is-he-or-isn't-he?"" working for the other side was compelling but clearly had nowhere to go in terms of development. Season 2 lost its way completely. But season 3 rewarded the patient viewer with a brilliant twist and a multi-layered depth. It exposed a more nuanced web of relationships, the moral element of decision-making in the eternal ends-and-means dilemma and a mature understanding of the politics at play in a cruel world.

This was the season that made us realise that Homeland wasn't really about Brody at all; it was about Carrie. It was always about Carrie.",1387756800,227,961,4.956521739130435
5991590,4,B00FGEO9NE,"Well, this was a perfect show, but Homeland ends for me with the death of Brody.  I cannot and will not see season 4 without Brody, because this character was the center of it all, from beginning to end.  Unless the Brody who was hanged was a hoax, I will not see season 4 at all.  Thanks for the show, it was great.  I was hoping some form of peace and reconciliation between Brody and Dana.  Unless season 4 may have it, I don't know.",1387324800,7,436,4.08235294117647
5991591,3,B00FGEO9NE,"In its third season, Homeland managed to top itself in terms of paranoia, plots that make no sense and just all-out weirdness. Its become so weird that its more watchable. Nothing really makes any sense at all but the the whole thing just keeps speeding up. You know watching in your heart that the train wreck is coming, but you just keep on watching.

For those keeping track, we started out three years ago with Osama BL kidnapping and brainwashing an American soldier so that he could get even with Dick Cheney for killing one of his children. Insane CIA agent Carrie manages the the case so well that not only is the Vice President Cheney dead, but also CIA Headquarters is blown up.

Carrie's love interest Brody, who murdered Dick Cheney (no big deal), is framed for blowing up the CIA building (a big deal). So now he is an innocent Vice Presidental assassin on the run accused of a bombing he didn't commit.

The questions at the start of the season are:

- Why the country isn't more appreciative of all that Carrie has accomplished?

- Someone organized a plot to use Osama BL to brainwash an American Soldier into killing Dick Cheney so that the CIA would be distracted so that they could blow up CIA Headquarters. Who could have organized such a complex plot? The only clue we have is that the planner apparently had no particular follow-up plan after blowing Langley up.

- Can our innocent vice presidental assassin prove that he is innocent of blowing up the CIA and become an all-American hero again?

- What is day to day life like for the children of a Vice Presidental assassin who is falsely accused of planting a bomb at the CIA?

I'm not going to bother to spoil the details of season three. It makes everything that came before just seem very simple and straightforward. Following the pattern, next season will probably feature the Russians as the paymasters behind the paymasters who blew up the CIA. Then season five will introduce the Chinese as the paymasters behind the paymasters behind the paymasters who blew up the CIA. Or maybe the guy with the cat who ran SPECTRE in the old James Bond films will turn out to be behind everything.

Homeland. Its become so crazy, its fun....",1387238400,5,2209,4.600508905852418
5991592,4,B00FGEO9NE,"""Homeland"" has never been able to live up to the momentum it generated during its first season. The second season was very good, but not as exhilarating as the first. Without giving too much away, the third season was a bit disappointing for the first several episodes, leading to a shocking twist that really turned things into high-gear.

Season 3 basically deals with Brody being on the run following the CIA bombing. His family (who we don't see much of all season) is struggling during the aftermath, as is Carrie, who has a little secret she doesn't let anyone in on for a while. Ultimately, Brody is offered a chance at redemption, and the latter half of the season focuses on his quest to achieve that. The final episode of the season, while shocking to some, was also expected, and I think will lead the show into a successful fourth season. You have to ask yourself, what is this show really about? It's not about Brody. It's not even really about Carrie.  It's called ""Homeland"" for a reason: the show is about this country's war on terror. With such superior writing, I'm sure the show can continue solidly next season missing one, and perhaps two of its central characters. It will be very interesting to see what direction the show goes next year.",1387152000,128,1261,4.650224215246637
5991593,5,B00FGEO9NE,"SPOILERS, I just watched the last episode of this season that premiered earlier tonight. and all I can say is WHY!!!! brody dies. :( after watching I thought they suprised fans with a SERIES finalie, not just season finalie, but after googling I find that they are indeed making a season 4, my opinion on that is obvious. HOW CAN YOU HAVE A SEASON 4 without brody!!! it was him carrie and saul that kept me watching and in particular the relationship between carrie and brody, even when they were apart. now that brody is dead how can they go on!!! they also seemed to have wrapped up everyones storie pretty much, where a season 4 isn't needed. I mean, what kind of story could they make to carry out the rest of the charachters thas going to be as good as the previous 3 seasons. Ill also admit I was dissapointed that the first half of the season was boreing,  too much of dana and brodys family,  and because there was no brody, except for that one episode where you learn he was shot and help hostage again. I don't watch shows like this Im 21 but the first season the relatioship with carrie and brody got me hooked, and since dexter was over I kept watching, I love this show and Im so sad to see brody fiinally die. :( I will be suprised if season 4 will beat the first 3.  the brody actor was amazing by the way and this last episode is soo hearbreaking. but if it were the last season I would understand and accept that, but they are moving on without brody. it should be intrested to see how that goes.",1387152000,6,1513,4.246527777777778
5991594,4,B00FGEO9NE,"The first two seasons were outstanding.  I understand that I am watching something meant to entertain & captivate me.  I do not expect this to imitate real life.  I completely disagree with the person who said that this is some sort of example of the worst type of CIA operative.  Frankly, we need people,who think outside the box because ""the box"" is rather pathetic.  I love complexity of the characters.  I think that it would be much more interesting if the focus was take  off of teenagers.  Get back to the basics of the wonderfully complex characters and it will become the 5 star that it should be.  Claire Danes depiction of a bi-polar individual is fabulous.  I applaud the series for enlightening the public about mental health issues.  It's merely a chemical imbalance - like diabetes - it just so happens that the imbalance affect the brain organ.  Knowledge is good and we, as a society, need to grow up and to stop being discriminatory.  Hopefully, season 4 will get back to Carrie, Sol and Brody.",1386720000,23,1012,4.649717514124294
5991595,2,B00FGEO9NE,"This season Homeland  decide it would be much more interesting to bog the series down in the misadventures of an annoying teenage girl better placed on a bad episode of Gossip Girl.
Who needs to see the machinations of the the C.I.A., Brody's occasional appearance, Quinn standing around doing nothing, Saul mumbling something, and Carrie's continuing array of facial ticks to convey I'M CRAZY!
All that doesn't matter when Dana can entertain Homeland fans with her crazy teen angst misadventures. Too bad she's been given the flick for season 4.
