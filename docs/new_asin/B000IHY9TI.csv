2655804,2,B000IHY9TI,"I was so excited to see BL was coming out with a new DVD. I lost all my baby weight with number one. I LOVED Bob and the workouts were great. I was bummed with this DVD. Kim annoys me and she is EVERYWHERE. I thought the ""girl"" workout that she did was too tough. I had to keep stopping and I'm in decent shape. I was able to do all the workouts on the first one with no problem. The segments were a bit strange. I was happy to have a shorter cool down as I couldn't be bothered with the LOOONNGG one from the first DVD, but it doesn't have relaxing music like the first, and again it is KIM. I was bummed the entire workout and I'm not looking forward to doing it tomorrow. I think I'll go back to the first. I really disliked this DVD. :(",1168819200,4,740,3.9072847682119205
2655805,5,B000IHY9TI,All that I can say is that this DVD has made me look forward to exercising. Bob Harper is so motivating. Kim Lyons is no joke - she will give your body a work out.  I do think that the Season 1 DVD is more strenous - but both DVD's are totally different,1168473600,7,253,3.7735849056603774
2655806,5,B000IHY9TI,"You have to start with yourself and get motivated! When you get to that point, this is the DVD for you..I feel great after working out, not tired or bored.",1168473600,3,155,4.2
2655807,5,B000IHY9TI,This workout comes highly recommended!!  Just the availability of the variety of workouts makes it worth the purchase - not to mention having Bob lead you into a butt-burning experience!! The first one was great but this is the icing on the cake - well done Biggest Loser team!!,1168300800,2,278,4.673469387755102
2655808,5,B000IHY9TI,There is nothing better than the freedom of working out at home on my own time.  The 'Biggest Loser Workout' did it again!  It's totally worth getting.,1168300800,2,151,4.555555555555555
2655809,3,B000IHY9TI,"Like most sequels, this one was not as good as the first.  Before I begin my review, I just want to note that I have been working out for many years and consider myself to be more advanced than beginner.

I was glad that Matt and Suze from season 2 were in the DVD.  I was happy to see Eric, too, since he is the only season 3 cast member that I liked because he wasn't creating drama, whining, or crying constantly.

One of the big problems I have with this video is the menu.  The text is very tiny, and I can barely see it with my 20/20 vision.  The workouts are called one thing on the back of the DVD case, and another on the menu screen.  For instance, ""Low Intensity Cardio"" on the case is ""CardioMax"" on the menu, which is very confusing.  ""Low"" and ""Max"" are two different things.  The workouts on the screen menu are also listed in a different order than they are on the case.  The option of doing a workout without the trainer is an option, but I would also like the option of doing it without the music.

I thought the warm-up was good, and the functional flexibility actually made me a little sore the day after doing it, which was surprising, seeing as how you don't sweat during it and it's low/no impact.  I didn't think the boot camp was as difficult as the first DVD's.  I am tired of the same old standbys of squats, lunges, and plies, and this DVD is packed with them, especially in the Power Sculpt for Women, High Intensity Cardio for Men, and the High Intensity Cardio for Women (although I do like the plyos in this section and my heart definitely works).  I liked the Power Sculpt for Men, and I wish the women were working out with weights in their segments.  I barely broke a sweat in the Low Intensity Cardio segment, so I had to modify it to get my heart rate up.  The cool-down was shorter than the first DVD, which I liked (who needs a 20 minute cool-down when they can do it in 5?), although the quads and pecs never got stretched, and I don't understand how you can get a good stretch when you're standing on a hill trying not to fall over, which is what the castmembers are doing in this segment.

As with the first DVD, the trainers don't always work both sides of the body evenly, so I either keep count and make sure I get it even, or I switch leads each time I do the DVD (they work the right side, I'll work the left, and vice versa next time).  This drives me nuts; I don't know why they bother working both sides if they aren't going to be worked evenly.  The trainers, at times, also say left when it's my right, which I've noticed on a lot of workout videos and it's another pet peeve of mine.  Obviously we don't work out facing away from the TV!",1168214400,24,2690,4.176356589147287
2655810,5,B000IHY9TI,"I like this even a little more than the first workout.  I think it's possible for all levels to gain something from this.  You can choose your own personal workout by choosing from the various segments here.  Each segment is around 10 to 15 minutes and they all do different things like fat burning, flexibility and toning various muscle groups.  Even better, if you are a woman there are segments that focus a lot on abs and thighs.  Bob and Kim are enthusiastic and help you along, and it's nice to see real people (former contestants) perform the routines (instead of the always stick thin exercisers).

All you need to get started is a fair bit of room, weights, a stability ball and you can opt to use a medicine ball if you have one.  Overall, it's a great workout that is made better by the customisation which I love.  I really like it and have found already in the while since I've gotten this, that I'm feeling good.  Hope you love it too.",1167350400,85,949,4.408045977011494
2655811,5,B000IHY9TI,"I really liked this workout.  It is great, and it has all sorts of different aspects and different workouts for you to choose from.  There are even tailored workouts for men and women, but you can choose to do any, and still get a great workout!
This workout DVD has shorter workout segments, meant so that you can mix and match the different workouts together, or just do a short one for the day!  I tried three of the workouts today, and the trainers (Bob, and Kim) kicked my (....)... but they were GOOD quality workouts.  I will definately use this workout DVD a lot, and incorporate it into my physical fitness and exercise program.
The ONLY thing that I wish was a little (only a little) bit different with this workout, is that I wish there was more of BOB!!  I feel that there isn't enough of him on there.  I also have the first BL workout and love it, and so I'm used to Bob being on there, and miss having him motivate me with every workout.  For a beginner (well, at least with the public) Kim does alright though! :)

I highly recommend this workout to anyone and EVERYONE!!!

Get it, it's good!!!",1166486400,17,1110,4.349514563106796
2655812,5,B000IHY9TI,"I think the workouts are great!  You really get a lot for one dvd.  It's nice that they have the separate workouts tailored to men and women's needs. Kim is a little annoying to me.  I'm not sure if it's just that she tries too hard. But her exercise moves are good. I love Bob!  He's always so motivational.  What I like about this dvd is that, like the previous dvd, it provides challenging workouts with both strength training and cardio. And the workout times are even shorter than the previous dvd.  It's very user friendly in the sense that you can tailor it to the amount of time that you can personally dedicate to your workout.  Even if you can only do 20 mins., you really sweat.  Great job!",1165881600,50,701,4.338461538461538

I love that I can mix up different shorter workouts that fit my needs.
Really awesome workout!",1399852800,,145,4.84
2655836,4,B000IHY9TI,this is a great dvd i like how it has normal looking people doing the exercise.  it makes me feel i can do the same,1398556800,,115,3.6
2655837,1,B000IHY9TI,I do not like a workout that requires a whole room. I live in a ranch home and need a work out that can be performed in min. space and does not rock all the items off the shelves.,1381363200,,179,3.6153846153846154
2655838,5,B000IHY9TI,I really do like the biggest loser work out videos. I used the cardio max before this one and really like that one. I like the short work outs in this video. They pack a punch in a short time.,1377561600,,192,3.825
2655839,5,B000IHY9TI,Nice video.  Good workout that doesn't feel like your in a rut with it.  16 year old daughter loves it too,1376179200,,106,4.0
2655840,3,B000IHY9TI,"I have 4 Biggest Loser workout DVDs and this is the one I was least impressed with. The cardio workouts are great, just like on the other DVDs -- I like these DVDs specifically because I feel like I've just gone to an aerobics class at the gym when I'm done -- but the Boot Camp and Functional Flexibility sections aren't so helpful if you don't have the extra ""supplies,"" particularly the stability ball.",1375920000,,405,4.486486486486487
2655841,5,B000IHY9TI,"This workout video is inspiring and helpful - I look forward to exercise when I can choose my workouts, and Bob Harper makes it fun and challenging.  I have purchases many exercise  videos and this series is the  best!  Your time is not wasted,  things move along, and before you know it, you've finished your workout, and sometimes you even are sad it's over!  Excellent.",1367712000,,372,4.6461538461538465
2655842,4,B000IHY9TI,"I like this video, mainly because you can customize your workout and do all or some of the exercises. It also has an option to turn off the dialog which is nice.",1365984000,,161,4.0625
2655860,3,B000IHY9TI,"I liked the burn in this one, but found it a bit hard on my knees.  I like some of the other TBL DVD's much better.  I recommend this for those without knee problems.",1365206400,,166,3.8529411764705883
2655861,4,B000IHY9TI,i really like this tape does really good. you have to work out to it 6 days to get good results,1362355200,,95,3.5714285714285716
2655862,4,B000IHY9TI,It was a very good video. I will do this as part of my exercise routine to keep myself fit.,1359244800,,91,3.6
2655863,5,B000IHY9TI,I have several biggest loser dvds and I love them all. They provide a great workout! I would recommend this to anyone!,1356825600,,118,4.409090909090909
2655864,4,B000IHY9TI,"I like the programmable short segments, but sometimes the workouts drag on. I love Bob (have his solo workouts not BL related), but in the BL workouts he seems more unorganized. It's like he slapped together the moves. I was disappointed in the women's toning workout as it only focused on lower body. I do like the functional flexibility and felt that was the most organized segment on the dvd.",1356739200,,395,4.6571428571428575
2655865,5,B000IHY9TI,"2 months ago I purchased a Treadmill with the IFit program. Though I love how I feel AFTER the workout, it gets a bit boring, staring at the walls. I was not able to locate any treadmill specific Biggest Loser DVD's, so I bought other Biggest Loser DVD's and adjust my treadmill workout accordingly. I pop the DVD's into my laptop, sign on to IFit, put the laptop on the treadmill and run the Biggest Loser DVD.
It's great for interval training! I walk at varying speeds to the workouts and run or sprint during jumping jacks for instance.
Love Bob's count downs from 10-0. They help me stay focused.",1353628800,,600,4.463636363636364
2655866,2,B000IHY9TI,"I like the video, but not as good as the biggest loser 1. The video is broken down differently had hard to set up a total workout, also the woman instructor in the video is half dressed and I have a hard time looking at that while I'm working out.  I try to set up the workout with Bob Harper leading them even thou they are designed for the men.  Like it ok, but would chose the first one over this one.",1349481600,,404,3.9146341463414633
2655867,4,B000IHY9TI,"The workout video (to tell the truth) isn't my favorite of all of the Biggest Loser workout videos, but it still does get you sweating.  I wish the workouts were a little more intense and thought it was odd that they broke the workouts out by ""men"" and ""women"".  None of the other Biggest Loser DVD's I own do this, so thought it was weird and even a little discriminating.",1340064000,,373,4.314285714285714
2655868,4,B000IHY9TI,"This is a great workout that complements Biggest Loser 1 very well, adding variety to cardio, toning and sculpting.  Very challenging, and I see and feel my body changing.  Unfortunately, Bob Harper is not the only trainer in this one.  An additional trainer, not part of Biggest Loser, is added.  My wife and I call her ""Barbie on Steroids.""  This takes away from the ""real people doing real workouts"" feel, and her too perfect body is distracting.  If you are choosing between Biggest Loser 1 or 2, choose 1.",1317081600,,510,4.674157303370786
2655869,5,B000IHY9TI,The video was pretty good. I definitely got a good sweat. I like that you can select exactly which workouts you want to do and it tells you how long your workout will be.,1314835200,,170,4.029411764705882
2655880,5,B000IHY9TI,"I have this video at work, but loved it so much that I bought it for home.  It was in great conditio and I would definately buy from you again.
Thank You,",1303862400,,154,3.8125
2655881,3,B000IHY9TI,"Being a fan of The Biggest Loser, I was excited about buying this DVD in 2009 and ready to get back in shape. Even though I wasn't in good shape, I didn't find this workout very challenging. Also, it was a bit on the boring side. The same held true for the other 3 TBL workout DVDs that I bought. They are designed for people who really are in poor physical condition. If you're in horrible shape and long to workout with the trainers from the show, then this workout is for you.

If you can walk to your car without getting winded or pulling a hamstring, I strongly recommend P90X. It's quite challenging and filled with variety. There's a different workout for each night. Tony Horton is much more engaging than Bob or Jillian. Though I have to modify nearly half of the moves, I'm getting good results so far with regard to strength, flexibility and weightloss (averaging 3 - 5 lbs each week). You'll never get bored with these workouts. Check out Tommy Mygrant's story - [...]",1300147200,,980,4.4748603351955305

After doing the exercises it became a really good way to stay fit,I`m really happy I purchased this dvd and the other one ""cardio max"",so I can alternate days,I know these are going to help me loose weight(beside changing my meals,)and I am going to be a very happy healthy person.",1297555200,,462,4.383720930232558
2655883,4,B000IHY9TI,"I've used a variety of workout DVDs and this is one of the best.  So many workout DVDs are filled with professional dancers doing all the moves perfectly. NOT this one!  This DVD has ordinary people, all of whom have lost a lot of weight by becoming more serious about exercise and healthy eating.  Most of the exercises are quite easy to execute.  If the moves might be challenging they explain modifications. My only compliant against this DVD is that music is a very minor part of the workout.  Music really helps me when I'm exercising.",1292976000,,540,4.583333333333333
2655884,5,B000IHY9TI,Yesterday I was Black Friday shopping and I found this dvd for 2.99. I started it today. If you can hang in there with the trainers it is a great workout. I made it through 25 minutes today and I hope to keep doing it atleast 5 days a week. I hope to see the results soon. It is a great buy!!,1290816000,,292,3.725806451612903
2655885,3,B000IHY9TI,"This video is a little ridiculous.  First, I have only done the men's portion of the weight training, but the only word to describe it is ""ridiculous"".  First - the supporting cast are all over the place, not consistent and not always safe with their movements.  Bob also commented to grab heavy dumb bells, but the moves are a mix of aerobic and weight training moves - so moderate weight dumb bells might be a better choice.  The cardio work was alright, but not really the kind of work I would like to do.  I have all of the other Biggest Loser DVDs except ""Boot Camp"", so had high hopes about this one - it failed in my eyes.  The good points are that you can completely customize your workout easily... otherwise - I will probably not use this tape very often.",1281916800,,765,4.352112676056338
2655886,5,B000IHY9TI,Love these DVD's! I just got the regular shipping and it came in about a week (maybe a little more). Very happy with the service and product. Thank you.,1265328000,,152,4.275862068965517
2655887,3,B000IHY9TI,"I don't like the this dvd as well as the first one. First, Bob doesn't do a lot of the workouts and he was my major motivator. Second, I don't like Kim, I find her very annoying and don't really like the workouts she does. I would rather get verbally beaten by Jillian than listen to her voice. Third, I don't think it's as challenging as the first dvd either. Don't get me wrong the workouts leave me dripping buckets of sweat, but I just don't think it's as fun. I can't wait to blast through this 6 weeks (that's the time frame that I'm using the dvd) and move on to Bob's Boot Camp and Yoga workouts, so I can get my motivator back!!!",1263859200,,638,4.112
2655888,4,B000IHY9TI,"I bought it knowing that I would love it! and I do! But I feel like i will eventually need to step it up another level. Not that is a bad workout, its GREAT! But I do feel that as I gain resistance i will need to change it up with other videos. Before you know it you will master ALL of the workouts. What i have done is mix it up a bit with other Biggest Looser videos. I do love that you can customize your work out for male or female and intensity. The ""Flexible"" part is really good, I feel like I can move a bit better. The women s workouts are good for beginners, I like to mix it up with that every now and then. You will need an exercise blowup ball, weight balls and hand weights for some of the workouts. I substituted a weight ball for hand weights, same effect. You will sweat. Get off your tushies and get to sweatin!!!",1253750400,2,832,3.9583333333333335
2655889,4,B000IHY9TI,I have borrowed this video several times from the library and loved it! I decided to purchase it so I wouldn't have to keep returning it.

2655910,5,B000IHY9TI,"I don't know what possessed me to buy this DVD (Part 1); I don't fancy the TV show.  But this turned out to be a really great exercise DVD for me.  Good warm-up, excellent workouts, and a fine cool-down.  The workouts are challenging without being tedious, and the instruction is very good.  And I must admit, I enjoy working out with those overweight folks.  They are very good, and I am impressed with their performances, confidence, and dedication.
The DVD jacket claims a running time of 109 minutes--that's pretty good for an exercise disc.  I have watched this DVD many times, and I still have not seen the whole thing; the low-intensity workouts have sufficed for me so far.  I look forward to trying the more advanced and challenging routines offered.

- Video kicks your butt

- DO NOT understimate the women's workout

Some are geared towards men and others toward women, but I enjoy the men's exercises as much as the women's.

2655916,4,B000IHY9TI,"I really have enjoyed this DVD.  The different options given really allow you to customize your own workout, even different men and women options.
  I do have to say that although the DVD cover says balance ball, weights and medicine ball optional, the one portion of this video really requires them (boot camp), I can't see a way for you to do the exercises without them.  That's the main reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars.  I do have the equipment and think the workout is great, but if you don't have them, I'd probably skip this DVD for a different one.",1224892800,3,563,4.375
2655917,5,B000IHY9TI,"What a fantastic DVD!  I had lost about 30 pounds the ""old fashioned way"" (that is, eating right and lots of exercise).  I maintained that loss and decided I would like to lose another 15, and my old DVDs just weren't going to do it any more.  I decided to get this one as a way to bust through my plateau and really kick-start things -- and boy, has it worked!  I've only lost 3 pounds since starting this DVD about 4 weeks ago, but I've lost 5 inches overall!

With this DVD, you mix and match all the parts to make a workout that fits into your schedule.  It's great for folks who don't have a lot of time, and just need to sneak a really intense, short workout in, as the longest ""chunk"" is only 15 minutes long.  Besides the warm-up/cool down, there are segments for Cardio (low impact OR high impact for either men or women), strength training (Bob's Boot Camp OR weight training for either men or women), and flexibility.

All of the segments are very challenging, no matter what your fitness level.  The weight lifting and high intensity cardio segments are always shown with easier adaptations of the moves, and Kim and Bob even show ways to make the moves harder if you need a bigger challenge.  I always end up dripping sweat when I'm done (if you don't want to sweat, skip this and go for a walk outside), and feeling AMAZING.  You WILL feel the burn with this workout!  Be forewarned though, there are A LOT of squats and lunges, so if you have joint problems, you should talk to your Doc or just skip this.

The best part, I think, is the fact that the contestants are the ones doing the workouts.  You're not watching 6 super thin/super buff people do the moves perfectly without ever breaking a sweat.  You see regular people who have lost weight and want to lose more working their butts off.  It's encouraging to see folks weighing 75 pounds more than me doing these moves, losing their balance, groaning with effort... When you do this DVD, you can't help but think, ""if these guys can do it, I can too!!""  And Bob and Kim really drive that message home.

Just a GREAT DVD for anyone who needs a challenge.",1223164800,12,2125,4.377551020408164
2655918,2,B000IHY9TI,Lunges and squats are the two exercises that destroy the knees.  The Biggest Loser workouts are full of both.  I recommend that you avoid at all costs...your knees will thank you.,1220400000,5,179,4.741935483870968
2655919,5,B000IHY9TI,"This DVD is awesome! It is great for those just getting started as well as for the more advance/active types. The workouts are customizable so you can quickly select what you have the time and energy for that day. It's so motivating, challenging and yet attainable. To me its pretty much like having the Biggest Loser trainers stop by my house every morning to give me a little push. Just the best!!",1216598400,2,399,4.555555555555555
2655940,5,B000IHY9TI,"Our family loves this dvd. Lots of customizable workouts so each day can be different. We like to mix this one in with the other Biggest Looser workouts. In this one there are men's and a women's cardio and sculpting workouts as well as others for co-ed workouts making 9 mix and match workouts. Truly versatile! Lots of The Biggest Looser cast members workout with you and keep you inspired. If they can do it, so can we! They are so real and struggle just like us.

The low-impact options are minimal in this version and the one low-impact version requires equipment not commonly on hand and not advised on the jacket.  I have hand weights at home so that piece was not a problem, but I don't have an exercise ball (the large one or the small ""medicine ball"" type) and really don't have room for those.

I am in good shape from exercising every day and after this workout my legs were sore the next day.  Most of the focus is on lower body. Also you need a Medicine Ball and a big stability ball for one of Bob's workouts.  I just used a 5-pound weight instead and did the exercises(crunches and weights) on the floor as I don't have a stability ball. Bob and the people are more fun in the first DVD, but Kim gives a couple of great workouts at 10-minutes apiece for the women.",1203465600,3,594,4.094827586206897

So i bought this dvd and it sat around for awhile until it made me feel guilty enough that i hadn't tried it.  I did the whole thing straight through minus the men's workout.  It'll make you sweat and if you're a beginner like myself you will be hurting SO BAD the next day but i guess that's a good sign. Kim is good but Bob is fantastic.  I know alot of people have a grudge with Kim and she does have that I'm a professional so do exactly what i do attitude.  So i get it.  Bob though is just like do what you can, when you can, and you'll do fine.  He is support, he is awesome, i wish he were my personal trainer. Honestly i enjoyed the dvd, i look forward to doing it again when i can move again (its a day later, i hurt everywhere).",1200873600,2,898,3.8956043956043955

The reason is the segments on this one are too short for me.  I am looking for workouts that are longer than 10 minutes, although sometimes they come in handy when I am short on time.  The high impact segments really get your heart pumping.

2655973,2,B000IHY9TI,"Well I was not a biggest loser fan until the 2007 season.  I got interested because of the theme song ""What Have You Done today to Make You Feel Proud?"". That's when I went to the library and checked out both DVD's I and II and the old book and new cookbook.  I watched both DVD's and decided to go with the 2nd because it was newer and the people keep the same timing on the exercises.  Also DVD 1 only had 4 weeks of exercises. It said 1-3 and 2-4.  Pretty confusing I didn't know if I should alternate 3 - 4 the last 2 weeks or not.  Anyway I bought the 2nd DVD.  It was okay at first, but I AGREE BOB is a better motivator than Kim. Her voice is so annoying, she is almost as bad a Jillian but at least I feel like Jillian cares sometimes.  Bob makes me feel like I can do it.  Kim makes me feel fat, stupid, and beneath her level.  Maybe some of you love her, or maybe I'm paranoid.  All I know is I've done her workouts and she makes me feel like a big loser alright.  Just not the kind on the show.  The DVD does have some good qualities.  I admit the workouts are hard for me, but the DVD doesn't make me want to come back.  I looked up and 3 weeks have gone by again and I haven't worked out.  Motivation is one of my problems.  Today I decided that I'd rather workout with the 1st DVD even though the people are not n-sync with each other.  WHY you might ask?  Because BOB made me feel special, like I could do it, like it didn't matter that I couldn't keep up.  HE MOTIVATED me.  I should have just gotten it in the first place.  Don't get me wrong, if you are an exercisers you might like Kim's methods better.  I do wish Bob would at least keep the timing in the first tape.  But if you are not a self-motivator and need a good encourager then the 1st DVD is for you.  If you are self-motivated and can't quite do something more stenuous then DVD 2 is for you.  I hope this review is helpful to someone out there trying to decide between the two DVD's.",1194652800,12,1965,3.9641943734015346

I'm torn as to whether I like video or not though. I like seeing REAL people, but I 'm personally having trouble with the fact that they all weigh the same as I do now. I know I'm not fit like they are. But it makes me wonder (and question) whether or not I can ever attain a goal 120 with a starting weight of 170. If they are still in the 150 range, will I ever get past 150 on my own? I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to lose weight. I did feel great after doing it once and I expect that I still will. I know some people said that it's distracting sometimes when the background people are out of step, but that's mild. You can't expect to stay in step every time. I just wish that they had women who were in the 120-140 range so I had something to look forward to.",1192579200,2,949,3.922279792746114

I love Bob and find him very motivating while I'm not as crazy about the girl (wish Gillian would do one) I like here toning for women section.

It has some balance ball workouts that you need to raise the ball over your head.  My ceiling was not high enough.  So I missed out on a few workouts.

2656003,4,B000IHY9TI,"I have had this DVD for a couple of months now, and it has become one of my more frequently used workout videos. As with the first Biggest Loser workout, I really like the fact that you can mix and match workouts to suit you. The  DVD contains 9 segments. After reading previous reviews, I tried all of them, not just those gender-specific to me. The Women's workouts tend to focus more on the hips, thighs and butt, while the Men's workouts work the arms and chest more. I tend to like Bob's training style over Kim's - she can be a little too 'aerobics instructor' for me. Still, I have to hand it to the girl, she does most of the exercises with you, and she's still able to talk and be perky doing it!

This volume also uses more equipment - several segments use the stability ball, and a medicine ball in addition to the hand weights used in the first volume. And while I enjoyed doing the arm and ab workout on the stability ball in the boot camp segment, I thought that the boot camp in Volume 1 still provided a better workout.

I also didn't particularly enjoy the Functional Flexibility segment, which focuses more on range of motion and slower movements. Not much in the way of cardio or weights as I have become accustomed to with BL workouts.

Also, as some other reviewers mentioned, a lot of product promotion went on. And there was less of the contestant's success stories, which I personally found to be motivating.

I still prefer the first volume over this one, but, in the end, it does provide a good workout. Like the previous volume, it is guaranteed to make you sweat, and work all those areas you want to target. Definitely, a lot of bang for your buck.",1182556800,10,1677,4.396774193548387

One of my complaints is there is too much talk. I guess I prefer instruction without the chit chat about how I'm feeling it burn.. I prefer the segments with Bob in them over Kim partly because Bob seems a bit more down to earth, though Kim's segments are tough. My other problem is that there seems to be a lot squats & lunges in the different segments so there isn't much variety as I had hoped and the arms & abs only have the Bootcamp 15 minute workout (Granted I prefer toninng my abs, butt, & arms).

PROS:  1)It offers the ability to customize your workout, you can do a little or a lot. 2) Old favorites Suzy & Matt make appearances  3) The workouts offer variety by using weights and exercise balls  4) Regular people (not Barbie dolls) doing the exercises right along with me

CONS:  1) Unlike Vol 1, they do not offer 1-click preset workouts (b/c of all the options - I keep forgetting which workouts I like and find myself starting and stopping)  2)  There seems to be a lot of hidden commercials (At the end of a workout Bob talks about Jennie-O turkey)  3) the cool-down in Vol 1 is beautiful and tranquil - the cool-down in VOl 2 is low-budget and rushed  4) My biggest complaint is Kim - I personally don't enjoy working out w/ her

They also use a medicine ball but my ball works just as well since it has sand inside so that it does not roll.  Hand weights are important too.

The DVD is set up very nicely. There are about 10 or 12 different workouts and the dvd allows you to choose how you would like to set up your workout. So for example you can pick warm-up (5 minutes), functional flexibility (10 minutes), women's or men's cardio (10 minutes)and the cool down (5 minutes). So you have now just created your workout of 30 minutes. It is very high intensity and the good thing is that you can go at your own pace and you switch up your routine according to the exercises you choose.

I usually do 20 minutes in the morning, just by picking 2-10 minute sessions. It will have you sweating in no time, it's quick, it's realiable and your favorite contestants are right there with you.

2656065,5,B000IHY9TI,This workout DVD lets you customize your workout!  If you're in a hurry choose one 10 minute session.  If you have time choose 3.  This workout features Bob and Kim.  It's a great way to mix things up a bit in your workout routine.,1169078400,,231,4.181818181818182
2656066,4,B000IHY9TI,"I love working out with the Biggest Losers!  It's great to know those working out on the video with the trainers are ""real people"" who have lost signifigant weight and having watched the show I feel like I know them.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I am personally not motivated as much by Kim and the segments specific to women are led by her.  They are good workouts though.  I have also tried and enjoyed the two segments intended for men... I just use lighter weights!",1169078400,3,496,4.301075268817204
2656067,5,B000IHY9TI,"I absolutely love watching The Biggest Loser. I'm a stay at home mom with 3 kids with little time to workout. This DVD is packed with great workouts. After just 2 days of using it, I can definitely feel a difference in all of my muscles. I love the option of chosing what I want to do, without the commitment of doing a full 30-60 minute workout at once. I do one or two 10-15 minute segments when I have the time and I can alternate every day which exercises I do. I love that the people in the background are real people; not skinny, muscular models. Great workout. A must have for anyone who had a hard time getting out to exercise.",1168992000,,635,4.170731707317073
2656068,4,B000IHY9TI,"I have to say, this was a good purchase. I really enjoy workouts that allow you to customize your session according to how much time you have, what you are motivated to do, what you want to focus on, etc.. The only criticism I have is (like many others) I want more of Bob! I don't know who cast Kim Lyons, but I'm hoping that they can find someone a little less annoying. I don't enjoy her voice or style, and she is honestly not very motivating. Bob, on the other hand makes you feel like he's really pushing for you-even if he can't actually see you :) Overall, I would recommend this DVD to anyone trying to get in shape.",1168905600,,625,4.1735537190082646

8145404,5,B000IHY9TI,I found this very easy to follow for both beginners and pros. It has different paces in case you need to slow down and not go so intense.  It helped me to shed a few pounds and whenever I need to tone up I pull it out and can quickly get the pounds off.  I love it!,1463184000,,265,3.6315789473684212

8145406,4,B000IHY9TI,"This DVD has workouts for everybody and you can make it shorter or longer, depending on your time availabilty. I like the chapters menu and the combinations one can make.  ""Music only"" option too. I also like the nice outdoor location of some of the segments. I never followed the TV show, but I thought this DVD offered a variety of workouts for all and I don't regret my purchase.

8145409,4,B000IHY9TI,"Just a side note... I have never actually watched The Biggest Loser, I just saw good reviews on the DVD's and started buying them :-)

I really liked the first DVD so I went ahead and got this sequel. It is different from the first in that Jillian is gone. Otherwise it's pretty much the same set up with different segments you can mix and match or do alone, except there are 9 this time. Most are 10 minutes but they are not easy by any means. You need weights and a mat (if your floor is hard) and for Bob's segments you do need to get a stability ball. I found one at Walmart for $9. It's not a bad investment especially when I got this DVD on Amazon for like 50 cents.

You will have to mix and match at least two of the segments in order to get any real benefit (I'm gonna guess 10 minutes isn't gonna burn any fat) but it's fun because you can switch it up pretty often. Make sure you have a good assortment of DVD's if you work out at home, that helps keep you motivated as well as keeps your muscles from doing the same moves every day.

Kim is slightly annoying to me , I prefer Jillian's personality than the perky happy cheerleader type Kim sometimes comes across as. But I really like the workouts and would recommend them to beginners or regulars.",1421539200,2,1260,4.155737704918033
