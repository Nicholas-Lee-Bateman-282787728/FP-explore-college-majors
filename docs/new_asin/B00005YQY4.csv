7956961,5,B00005YQY4,"It's the best skate video I've ever watched. Globe sponsored some sick skaters in 01, and this shows Rodney's truest street form.",1394841600,,129,4.909090909090909
7956962,5,B00005YQY4,The Mullen part basically sets the bar so high that nobody in the decade since has matched it. Incredible stuff.,1390608000,,112,4.65
7956963,5,B00005YQY4,This is the very first skateboard video I ever saw and it inspired me to become the athlete that I am now. this video started it all and it's a classic. It's got good tunes and the skateboarders in the video are amazingly talented. Love this video,1337299200,,247,4.276595744680851
7956964,5,B00005YQY4,"I basically bought this vid for Chad Fernandez. I knew Rodney Mullen was awesome before I purchased it so no surprises there. Mike Peterson's part was awesome as was everyone's elses part though, I didn't know much about the whole team before I bought this vid. It's packed with extras, and it's cool to see some of the biggest skaters of today in their early stages. The entire vid is a classic keeper. Recommended for anyone who loves skateboarding.",1279843200,,451,4.7215189873417724
7956965,4,B00005YQY4,"Good Skate vid.  Skating is good from Jayme Fortune.  Gershon has a good part.  Chet Thomas has some amazing hardflips.  Danny Gonzalez has fun on his board with tricks you won't normally see in a video.  Mumford grinds a lot.  Same with Chad Fernandez.  Rodney has the best part with amazing skating.  I don't know how he lands some of his tricks.  Definately worth buying for the Rodney part.  Some extras with a nice Am montage showing some kids riding globes like Wilt, Lutzka, Ramondetta, DJ chavez.  its fun to see where the kids ended up nowdays.",1146960000,,553,4.597938144329897
7956966,5,B00005YQY4,"The DVD doesn't have any extras really, but that's okay. The whole Globe team is just great, but Rodney Mullen's part is absolubtly mind blowing. No one in the world can do what he can do on a skateboard, and if you havn't seen his part in Opinion, you absolubtly have to. Its not the best skate video ever made from a presentation standpoint or even a skating standpoint (except for Rodney's part) but its still definitely a must see video.",1047513600,,441,4.45679012345679
