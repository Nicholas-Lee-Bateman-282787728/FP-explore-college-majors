8637027,5,B00HX2RRW2,"Finally, the holy grail of tv-on-dvd boxsets is coming to blu-ray and dvd on November 11, 2014.

What we know so far is that all 3 seasons / 120 episodes of the Batman 1966-1968 tv series have been painstakingly remastered and is set for release in one epic boxset 11/11/14. We also know there will be tons of bonus material.

Warner Bros. will reveal all of the details at Comic-Con on Thursday July 24. There is a panel discussion with Adam West, Burt Ward and Julie Newmar (meeeow) during which there will be a look at the box content, limited edition packaging and remastered footage will be shown so we can see how the show will look.

I will provide an update with all the additional information after Comic-Con.

Tune back on July 24 Same Bat-Time, Same Bat- Channel.

Update: since this appears to be a place-holder I will not update here.",1404518400,14,847,4.546052631578948

8637030,5,B00HX2RRW2,"This could finally be the year. Amongst other things, what was holding this up for so long was that Warner Brothers owned the character of Batman, while 20th Century Fox owned the series.

The success of the 1960s ""Batman"" can be summed up rather easily. What made this show so successful (at least for the first 2 seasons) was that we had Batman and his stodgy (but in a funny way) to provide a heroic character as well as consistency. And yet we could allow the villains to entertain us. The villains were often very, very bad. But they carried a charm that made them more likable than repulsive. And in some cases (such as the professor who banged his head and turned into the villain King Tut), they could be sympathetic as well.

Some of the episodes were hilarious, such as when the Penguin ran for mayor, but there were also some realistic commentaries on political campaigns. The Penguin was a known criminal, but many people attended his campaign because he knew the tricks. And the heroic (and just a little too honest Batman) had less than a dozen people at his campaign, and they were falling asleep.

Yet some episodes were on the frightening side. In ""The Joker Is Wild,"" the Joker finally had it with being beaten, and made his own utility belt. He fought surprisingly well in that episode, and he unleashed a wave of terror on Gotham. He even came really close to unmasking Batman and Robin.

It's probably also worth mentioning that the heroic Batman occasionally came up against a villain where he was reluctant to fight full force. A good example is when he came across Ma Parker. He was hesitant to use all his strength against a woman who was a criminal to be sure, but she seemed really motherly towards her children.

Adam West really loved the 1st season. He kind of liked the 2nd season. And he felt the show was already on its way out early in the 3rd season.

This is also a great tribute to the 60s.  You will also see a slew of famous actors who made guest appearances as villains or just appeared in brief cameos.

Let's hope that 2014 is the year where we will see this on DVD.",1397520000,7,2108,4.457142857142857
8637031,5,B00HX2RRW2,"After years of waiting Batman 1966 Series is finally going to get a DVD release! Now I see two listings for the series. One for DVD and one for Blu Ray. I'm guessing it's going to get a Blu Ray release? I hope so! I really do! And since the movie was put onto Blu Ray from Fox, there's no reason why we can't get a Bu Ray release. It seems back in January there was news about the series finally getting a release. I didn't know about it till now when I saw a article from the Tvshowsondvd website. As of right now I'm not trusting this news until I see a actual update from Warner Bros. I'm just annoyed it took this long to finally see this series get a release. Why? Because of the battle between Fox and Warner Bros. This is Warner Bros doing. We would of seen a release a long time ago for the series but Warner Bros wanted the rights to the series even though Fox owned it. They think that because they own all of the other Batman movies, shows and cartoons that they should have the 1966 series as well. It's insane because Fox made the series! They should of been the one to put it out not Warner Bros. It's frustrating and a lot of fans were mad about this whole thing. Well since Warner wanted it so badly, they better put out a awesome box set for this. My review will be updated once I get the series.",1397347200,7,1313,4.073359073359073
8637032,5,B00HX2RRW2,"The 3 seasons of the 1966 Batman TV Series are scheduled to be released this year, November 2014.
  As with all Amazon pre-orders, if the price goes down before the release date, you get the lowest price from the time you make the order.  Also, it's easy to cancel orders if you change your mind.  It's a bit expensive, but it's 120 half-hour episodes because there were two episodes a week when it was broadcast on ABC all those years ago for the first two seasons.  The third season it switched to once a week. I bet they're sorry now they cut back.

8637033,3,B00HX2RRW2,"BATMAN was a comic book-animated series that ran on ABC from 1966-68 regarding a wealthy entrepreneur Bruce Wayne(Adam West) and his ward Dick Grayson(Burt Ward) lead a double life: they are actually the crime fighting duo Batman and Robin. A secret Batpole in the Wayne mansion leads to the Batcave, where Police Commissioner Gordon(Neil Hamilton) along with police Chief O'Hara(Stafford Repp)often calls the Bat-duo on the Batphone with the latest emergency threatening Gotham City.

Racing to the scene of the crime in the Batmobile, Batman and Robin must (with the help of the trusty Bat-utility-belt) thwart the efforts of a variety of master criminals, including The Riddler(Frank Gorshin), The Joker(Cesar Romero), Catwoman(Julie Newmar), and The Penguin(Burgess Meredith).

BATMAN also had a lot of other interesting guest stars for villains like
*David Wayne as the Madhatter
*Roddy McDowall as the Bookworm
*Art Carney as the Archer
*Van Johnson as the Minstrel
*Vincent Price as Egghead
*Liberace as Chandelle
*Carolyn Jones as Marsha
*Cliff Robertson as Shame
*Milton Berle as Louie the Lilac
*Rudy Vallee as Lord Marmaduke Fogg

Unfortunately, by BATMAN's 3rd Season, the ratings were falling significantly and the future of the series seemed uncertain, despite the 1967-68 Season being the season when Yvonne Craig joined the cast & crew as Batgirl whom also lived a double-life as Comm. Gordon's mild-mannered librarian daughter(Barbara Gordon)at the Gotham Library since the producers wanted to keep up with the comic book, by adding Batgirl to the series.

The short was convincing enough for ABC executives to pick up BATMAN for another season, and for producer Bill Dozier to introduce Batgirl as a regular on the show in an attempt to attract more female viewers by adding Batgirl to the picture joining the dynamic duo's combat in crime, but unfortunately BATMAN was cancelled in the Spring of 1968.

The show was reduced to once a week, with mostly self-contained episodes, although the following week's villain would be in a tag at the end of the episode, similar to a soap opera.

Accordingly, the narrator's cliffhanger phrases were eliminated, with most of the episodes ending with him saying something to encourage viewers to watch the next episode.

It would be so cool if BATMAN was released on DVD so we can watch all the episodes complete & uncut like they were originally shown on ABC as opposed to having to watch them with a lot of deleted scenes & commercial disruptions on ME TV, TV Land, FX, and the Family Channel.",1395705600,11,2552,5.1201923076923075
