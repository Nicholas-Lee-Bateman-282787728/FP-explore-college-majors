5854855,4,B00DTPRZ10,"Kinda a perfect Chucky movie, honestly.  It's not Gone with the Wind, but it makes for a fun (and gory) escape.  I also have to praise the new cinematic direction this film takes over the comedies (which I also love).",1507852800,,217,4.4

5854858,5,B00DTPRZ10,"Carson chamois definitely executed way better than a lot of people thought its very well done, I think it pays to review to this from the 60s and 70s, with its school treelined with, of course. Chucky! This one seems to go more back to the roots of how child play part one was with more scare and although there is some its not a focal point like Bride and Seed more able to time some extremely well with the gore. This one successfully maintained provide of the original and the second. And he has a no. There are 3 before British, but I think players 2 of the scariest of the series If you were actually a child, then the films originally started coming out, especially the first and second. Those pills were actually scary, and when you were a kid shot scared head made you afraid of every doll saw as a child, even if you were a boy like myself, you were afraid of the cabbage patch doll your neighbor had for your sister had and until they became funny with the introduction of Tiffany in bride of chucky aka part for 1999 they became more funny and less scary so I really like this film due to the fact it actually made me jump and I believe the mist came out and I saw it for the first time I was mid 20s to anybody that has not seen us yet without giving anything away yes you do get it came and get to see Capetian surprise cameos from people from the earliest parts of the series so stay tuned to after the credits especially because this is the the unrated version. And for once there is a difference between the unrated and rated r editions. I own this on do men watch the both sins are completely different after saying and does not have the surprise cameos and the deaths of toned down way toned down!

I don't know it matters, but I really also like the back or that. There was somebody in a big chair and that when the. Main character that was to her who slash victim in the movie and also in the new film cult choke, because as somebody who is in a wheel chair, you never see that and when there is somebody who is in a wheelchair in the film, they get kill Bob in a good Obatala. And usually I love to death scenes. Though only the fact that there was a character in this light that was not meek and frail because not all of those are really was very cool and I was very happy the way to see her kill Chucky killed by Chucky, lol. But I like the fact or to say it was made her character strong. And that she is in the new one ",1507248000,,2444,4.057971014492754
5854859,5,B00DTPRZ10,I read some of the negative reviews and I was a little surprised at these so called die hard child's play fans. They said that a lot of this movie wasn't realistic well if you actually saw the other movies you would know that none of the murder scenes where realistic.. tha's just how the child's play movies where and apparently are. Now I would never go as far as to say that is was as good as the first few Chucky movies ( that would be almost iligal) but I did think it was a good addition to the franchise. I liked getting the a back story on Charles Lee ray. I do recommend this movie and am happy that I have it in my collection,1506902400,,635,4.0078740157480315

5854864,5,B00DTPRZ10,"The Child's play saga continues in this sixth installment in the series of the diminutive Serial Killer that is cute as a munchkin.
We are in Rhode island with the Pierce Family, Widow and Mother Sarah (Chantal Quesnelle) and Nica (Fiona Dourif, the Daughter of Brad Dourif who voices Chucky) a paraplegic since birth.
A mysterious large parcel is delivered with Chucky inside, unimpressed with the gift, Sarah dumps the doll in the trash bin (something that Chucky experiences quite a lot over the years).
Suddenly Sarah is found dead and the grief stricken Nica gathers the rest of the family together, her condescending and obnoxious Sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti), Ian the Cuckold Husband (Brennan Elliot), Jill the Attractive Nanny (Maitland McConnell) Innocent Alice (Summer Howell in her debut movie) and Father Frank (marvelously played by A Martinez).
They share all the memories and stories and had Dinner until Father Frank leaves to go back to St Paul's Church in a hurry in strange circumstances, after he is gone the family caught sight of an unknown stranger who is actually the Human ""Chucky"" Charles Lee Ray the Lakeshore Strangler in Ray Ban sunglasses in their old tape reels, when Barb and Nica's Father mysteriously drowns like Vivienne van Pelt who's body is found in the river (Chucky mentions her in Bride of Chucky) as possible offerings to Damballah who is the west African and Haitian Serpent God of rain and water surroundings.
As Nica has hunches and notions that led her to play detective as she explores deep into the realms of urban legend and scary camp fire ghost myth about a particular doll possessed by the angry and vengeful spirit of a Voodoo practising Serial Killer, she makes more gruesome discoveries as the film continues as she finds out Charles Lee Ray took an unhealthy interest to her heavily pregnant mother, Sarah, back in the Eighties as flashbacks.

Don Mancini can make masterpieces which is why Chucky flicks are a movie goer's most watched saga in every country as the most enjoyed entertainment. This is a brilliant, unapologetically brutal, and dazzling sequel that is better than Bride and Seed, you can get away with watching Child's play 3 and go straight to watching this and you can still catch up on the story.
Good music score and lighting, I love the setting of the haunted house feeling and pan angle shots, the best is the Dinner scene like a Russian roulette, and you see artsy shots of chomping mouths guzzling the gazpacho wondering who is going to die and the cast is teasing the audience, the death scenes are creative and well thought through with effort put in to create the film. Chucky displayed clever premeditated revenge as he continues to keep his promise since the original movie and still wants to claim a human body to transport his soul.
Fiona Dourif puts on an incredible performance and is emulating her Father in this movie, her beauty and heroine role resembles him in looks and intensity in one flew over the cuckoo's nest.
Watch out for the surprise ending after the credits roll which will lead us to ""Cult of Chucky"" as the next sequel",1494547200,,3127,4.833955223880597

5854877,5,B00DTPRZ10,"Curse of Chucky a great sequel to turn the Franchise around. This reminds me of the first one on how well it's done. It's very creepy and atmospheric with great action kills and suspense. It proves something old can be made new again. I love how Brad Douriff's daughter is the star of this.

  The fact she is in a wheelchair makes her more sympathetic and makes it look the odds are not in her favor against The Devil Doll  The little girl does a great job too. Some of the other actors don't treat the girl in the wheelchair with respect and make her feel bad so you don't like them. She doesn't want to be treated as if she is helpless or lesser because she is disabled and grieving over the loss of her mother.

  This one is old school scary and one of my favorite Chucky movies since 1 or Bride. Cheers!",1492646400,,809,4.180645161290323

5854900,4,B00DTPRZ10,"Overall, I enjoyed this. I'm not really part of the Chucky cult following, so I'm pretty objective. After a rough and cheesy start, I think this film starts getting good from the chili dinner scene onward. Chucky is like the Leprechaun, or an evil Santa or murderous Easter Bunny: something (a doll) we previously thought harmless, but full of harm. And, like the Leprechaun, Chucky has a sense of sarcasm and insult. Even though it's set in the ol' low-budget setting of one single setting for the most part, it keeps the viewer engaged, and ties things back to the first Child's Play film. It has a few jumpscare moments, and is mostly well-filmed and executed. It seems to have a level of quality for what it is that's impressive given it's the sixth film in a long franchise. Chucky's atheism and bleak philosophy on life (told via his little girl friend, Alice) is a high point.",1469491200,,883,4.630573248407643

5854917,2,B00DTPRZ10,"It's as if most of the budget went to the music composers. I really like that they attempted to bring this movie and Chucky back to its horror roots, but they tried too hard. Chucky actually even says ""I'm gonna get you"" all creepy & super cheesy. Chucky himself looks like some kind of anime, sumo wrestler creep. His effects get a little better towards the end of the movie (less CGI), but when you find out why, it's even still an upset that this movie took that route...again. I really like where they were going with this movie, more horror & not as much comedy, but I feel like I totally even could've thought of more creative chucky scenes. *Spoiler* Jennifer Tilly, while beyond a great actress, should not be in these movies anymore. That story should go down in Chucky history, not to be resurfaced anymore. I liked the alternate ending with an old friend. Fiona & Brad dourif are excellent actors, the rest, not so much. It would be cool to have brad as chucky for as long as it takes, he is chucky, and cool to see more of Fiona.",1466467200,,1041,4.371134020618556

Chucky has not been good since the original. I just couldn't stand the 2nd or 3rd film and 2 after were pretty much ridiculous comedies. However, Curse of Chucky goes back to its horror roots and delivers the GOODS. All the right elements are in this film including a creepy looking house in dire need of white paint on the walls, a rainy night, and an intriguing back story to complete the entire setup. I do not want to give the plot away, but this film is connected to the original and the performances in the film are great especially by the lead actress in a wheelchair.

I sat there with my palms all sweaty from the anticipation and the scares. Not sure if i saw the rated or unrated version, but i had to YouTube it to see the alternate ending. Check it out and don't miss this one.",1455926400,,961,4.251366120218579

I ordered both at the same time and they came in quickly and sealed as new.  It has been a couple of hectic months but I satarted watching them in the correct order.  I was actually surprised at how good they really were, and settled down tonight to watch the final installment, ""Curse of Chucky"".  I opened the sealed dvd package to find no disc.  There was an advert for downloading the Ultraviolet copy, but alas, no dvd.  I had no way to correct this because I was out of Amazon's return policy pervue, and I had no way to ask Amazon to open the next one to make sure there is a dvd in there, so I resorted to this review.

5854949,1,B00DTPRZ10,"Oh my, ""Curse of Chucky"" was bad.  Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, there's not a slasher sequel I don't like.  I own the Producer's Cut of ""Halloween 6"" and I think it's brilliant.  So when I say this movie had problems, you can be assured that a good portion of it was an unholy mess.  To warn you: here be spoilers.

The worst of it is that the first 2/3 are pretty good!  I mean, sure, it had a straight-to-video cast, but you could see that with actors who cost more it would have worked.  And the cinematography was weirdly excellent.  In this of all movies I actually found myself admiring the clever framing and unsettling close-ups.  It looked great!  And just seeing Chucky whole and scary again, seeing the work they were doing to create tension around him, letting the doll be creepy, having jettisoned all the goofiness of ""Bride"" and ""Seed"" made any lack of polish easily ignorable.

And then we hit the 2/3 mark and it went so far off the rails it was on the highway.

Right at the moment the scenario'd been established and it was time for things to start happening the plot just... disintegrated.  Previously reasonable people make bizarre leaps of logic (a quick Google search and we instantly all believe in possessed dolls), returning characters behave so wrongly it's an insult (Charles Lee Ray: kinda stupid), we don't know why anything's happening, and it's all a jumbled mess.

And even then I could still have enjoyed it, I really could, but for the sheer headless-chickenness of its approach to continuity.  One minute it's insisting on an *absolute dedication* to the established stories from the other films, even the silly stuff you know they'd have been happier to forget, and the next it's contradicting itself and blowing raspberries in the face of the very rules it's just gone to great lengths to remind us of!  Oh look, he still has his hairy eyebrows and scars under the mask because he's a flesh-and-blood creature since his soul is permanently trapped in the doll.  That's neat!  But wait, then how did she knock his head off earlier?  And why is he full of stuffing?  It made the movie confusing for anyone who knew the story AND anyone who didn't.  Plus it turned a previously interesting and cohesive mythology into gibberish.

The conclusion was deeply silly.  How on Earth did Nika get convicted?  The wounds would have shown there was another attacker, she had Alice's testimony, and the nanny cam footage.  One quick defense of ""it was a little person in a suit"" and she's acquitted.

I've read the interviews with Don Mancini about his plans to make Chucky scary again.  Then he makes his grand return and produces *this?*  Why didn't you just do the stuff you said you were going to do, Don?  Why?

As an aside, can no movie be made today that isn't trying to ignite some kind of war between the sexes?  I seem to recall decades of filmmaking wherein whole movies went by without a single character belittling another because of their chromosomes, but now it's every.  Single.  Film.  It's a little extra galling that 98% of the jabs are directed at men, pop culture's brain-dead punching bags.

And that last scene.  Good grief, that last scene.  So much was wrong with it.  It's possible that literally everything was wrong with that.  They may have filmed it with old banana peels and captured the sound using a moose just because that's the wrongest way to make a movie.  So, even though it's been established that he's trapped in the doll forever because he missed his window to escape, and he's just finished ranting about  he can get out whenever he now?  And into... a little girl.  Because girls.  And finally, we close on a jump scare of... a grandmother with a bag on her head.  Not strictly relevant, movie.  Why not have the kitchen toaster launch bread startlingly at the camera?  It'd have been as meaningful.

So, yeah.  The only way back for poor ol' Chucky now is some kind of reboot.  You can't follow this one.",1446163200,,3995,4.613086770981508

5854953,5,B00DTPRZ10,"Finally got around to watching this latest entry in the ""Child's Play"" series, and I went in with very low expectations. While I loved ""Bride of Chucky"" and the sense of humor that film brought with it, ""Seed of Chucky"" went a loooong way in killing off any interest in this series. I knew this had come out, and I also knew it went straight to video, which is never a good sign, so ""Curse of Chucky"" fell off my radar pretty quickly.

Stumbled across the Blu-ray at a yard sale a few weeks back and picked it up for $2, I figured I couldn't really lose at that price. Popped in the movie last night, and me and the kids had a BLAST!! This honestly may be my favorite film in the series.

As the movie opens a young woman in a wheelchair living with her mother in their old house receive a large package from Fed-Ex. Inside the package is a Good Guy doll, neither express much interest in the thing, and neither know who sent it. Forgotten they shove it in a chair and forget about it. Later that evening the mother ""commits suicide"", and her extended family come to the house for the funeral, giving us a large pool of victims for Chucky to work through.

""Curse"" isn't just a re-tread, it adds some new, fun twists to the story. I really liked that the film featured a young woman in a wheelchair as our protagonist, I'm not sure I've ever seen that in a film before? (No.....just no.....""Mac & Me"" doesn't count!!!). I like too that while they kept a touch of comedy in the film, the suspense also made a nice comeback. Now, I won't try to convince anyone that ""Chucky"" is scary, but they do a good job of building up the suspense in several scenes.

If you are a fan of the series, you'll enjoy all of the flashbacks, and ties this film has to the previous films in the series, but even if you haven't seen any of the other films, you'll still be able to enjoy this movie. Great for a Halloween party!!",1444089600,,1906,4.242424242424242

5855018,5,B00DTPRZ10,"Curse Of Chucky takes on a darker story and classic haunting atmospheric personality right from the beginning. It is a clean, strong and well thought out story to say the least. It is obvious that this sequel was not made just for the sake of twisted quick-wit banter and almost comical kill scenes from a Good Guy doll. Personally I feel satisfied in knowing that I can squeeze this sequel right into the series just after 1 & 2 and be happy or even as numero 6 considering the cool, slightly cheeky ending.

The special effects, and cinematography was classic horror atmospheric thrills. Camera tricks that accent the shadows, moments of sudden shock for real reason, and creepy sound effects played well against a truly freaky setting. Location is everything in a horror film and  Curse Of Chucky brings the spooky old house back to the foreground of horror. The characters are well written and offer just enough personality to connect with without becoming annoying or pretentious. Chucky himself was on screen and evil enough to be convincing and entertaining without looking completely childish or lame. That is a big part that makes the 3-5 sequels more stoned amusement than actual tales of terror. His presence is very strong and chilling on screen much like in the original and the second film which puts Curse Of Chucky as a great horror film and killer sequel. Blood and gore is limited to the absolute moments of necessity with the kill scenes sharing in the overall film rather than trying to become some overloaded spectacle. Curse Of Chucky is a awesome horror movie and one that any horror fan, especially of the Childs Play franchise will definitely enjoy.",1432512000,,1674,4.84965034965035

5855042,4,B00DTPRZ10,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I like this unique take on the series. On some occasions you could tell how low budget it seemed but nevertheless it works on what a chucky movie should be. A possesed doll killing people, what more does it need to be?",1427414400,,258,4.18
5855043,4,B00DTPRZ10,"The main movie takes place in the house of a young woman named Nica.  Nica had been in wheel chair her whole life, unaware that she was that way because Chucky had attacked her mom while she was pregnant.  The story begins with Chucky arriving in the mail.  Then her sister, brother-in-law, and niece arrive for a visit.  Chucky had wanted to kill Nica's entire family since he was still human.

The family dynamics were interesting.  Barb was pressuring Nica to move.  She'd convinced herself she'd wanted to help Nica,by putting her in assisted living.  The truth was she just wanted Nica to sell the family house, so Barb could mooch half the profit.

Barb and her husband were in need of money and still paid for a nanny.  Jill was a beautiful young blond, and not very good with Alice.  Surprisingly it was Barb who was having an affair with Jill.  I liked the irony of her husband, Ian, planning to use that affair to divorce Barb, take Alice, and leave Barb with nothing.  Interesting 21st century twist on a cliche story.

In the beginning it was unclear when this chapter took place - if it was a sequel or prequel. For half the movie Chucky's appearance was that of an undamaged Good Guy Doll.  He spent much time pretending to be a doll, killing without anyone knowing their peril.  When Chucky was exposed, he pulled a false face off himself - revealing the scarred and stitched together face, he'd had since Tiffany resurrected him.  After that he was a monster loose in the house, stalking and terrorizing Nica.

I'd thought ""Seed of Chucky"" had killed this series.  This chapter redeemed the Child's Play series, and gave the audience back the Chucky they're fans of.",1426982400,,1682,4.621621621621622

5855069,3,B00DTPRZ10,"Chucky looks sort of gay now, at least when his face goes from that of a still doll to a live one. When he smiles, he looks like a little fat Asian kid. The CGI, which doesnt kick-in until about the movies halfway point, is to blame. The corny Freddy-like one-liners he mutters before kills, overdramatic musical score and clich horror-flick plotting are the fault of writer and director Don Mancini.

For what its worth, Curse Of Chucky is better than Seed Of Chucky as it takes the series back to the more serious, less campy, tone of the original Childs Play trilogy. There are, however, major continuity problems. Why didn't a certain surveillance video acquit a certain character in court, I wonder. I also wonder why the movie has two contradictory epilogues tacked onto the end.

Now saying that, I am pleasantly surprised by the Curse of Chucky. This latest film moves away from the cheesiness and humor the last several sequels had, and takes a more serious tone for a horror movie. I don't want to give too much away, but this film is well executed and excellent. It may possibly be the best sequel in the franchise. Nevertheless, it is easily one of the best films in the franchise.

5855082,2,B00DTPRZ10,"Every CHILD'S PLAY film had a major theatrical release except for this installment, which had a limited one week theatrical showing while playing simultaneously on VOD. There's a reason for that. The film reeks to high Heaven. While the always welcome Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky (and Dourif's real-life daughter, Fiona Dourif, has a major role in this), the rest of the film is an unexceptional horror flick which is surprising, since it was directed and written by Don Mancini, who created the original screenplay to CHILD'S PLAY. It looks like this was filmed on the cheap and the Blu-ray just brings out the flaws. I'm a big fan of the Chucky films and this one is a major step-down from the others, but look for the appearance of a certain actress that was in the last two films in the series (this one takes place four years after the last film, 2004's SEED OF CHUCKY). The Unrated Version ups the blood and gore quotient from the R-rated version, yet it only adds-up to less than a minute of extra footage.

He becomes.more scary this time.,1412467200,,377,4.04
5855125,5,B00DTPRZ10,"The scariest Chucky yet! It had me jumping out of my seat a hundred times over. I am even impressed that Jennifer Tilly returns as Tiffany. And you even get to see Alex Vincent, who played Andy Barclay in the first two films. The film is absolutely one of the most interesting installments in the film series with a lot of unanswered questions at the end, like what is going on with Glen and Glenda. What made Tiffany Ray return to help her husband with his killing spree and what finally caused her to relapse back into killing. I have been a Chucky fan since I was three years old when I first saw Child's Play and I have been a fan ever since. I would recommend this movie to any Chucky fan but I will not go as far to say that it is a best of the Chucky films but it does make you want more Chucky. So here's hoping that Don Mancini and David Kirschner will bring us another Chucky film but that they won't take years to make more, as it was six years between Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky and nine years between Seed of Chucky and Curse of Chucky. I hope that they will not take a long time to make another film. Five out of five stars.",1411948800,,1146,4.075221238938053

5855151,3,B00DTPRZ10,"After 9 years, Chucky has finally returned in his sixth film. After the disaster that was 2004's Seed of Chucky, many fans of the franchise felt that they were owed another film, and they finally got one. The timeline of this film is a bit confusing though, as the characters refer to the events of the past films taking place 25 years ago, even though this film appears to take place before 1998's Bride of Chucky. Nica's family lives a quiet life on the outskirts of town. Her mother is obsessed with the home shopping network, so it's no surprise when a mysterious package shows up at their door. Inside that package, you guessed it, your friend til the end. Curse of Chucky plays more like the old school Child's Play films, rathen than the more recent comedic ones, whoever it does have it's funny moments. It's also unique in some ways, as for the first time the film features flashbacks, and real life appearances by the famed voice of Chucky, Brad Dourif. The story here was more of a tie in to older films that a stand alone sequel, but it gives fans a little bit of everything they've come to expect from Chucky. It may not be one of the best the series has to offer, but it's certainly better than the previous one, and it introduces a new generation to the simplistic genius that is Chucky.",1407628800,,1302,4.451882845188284

5855176,2,B00DTPRZ10,"As much as the craze is to reboot movies and return them to their roots, there is a time when this is just not a good idea. I can see the writers thinking Bride and Seed of Chucky were too goofy, let's make him scary again. The only problem is that Chucky was never as scary as people thought. Or more accurately, you have to be a certain age to be scared by a killer doll.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers think that Child's Play was a classic for all the wrong reasons and that the sequels were cool but then the movies went off the rails. So they do as much as they can to imitate the first movie, including a long slow build as a kid walks around with an ugly doll acting weird and saying things like ""Chucky says we're all gonna die"". The problem with this strategy is that we KNOW it's Chucky, the killer doll with a New Jersey gangster tough guy routine and so there's no tension and no shock when Chucky finally starts talking. Instead, it's a long dreary march through horror movie cliches leading to a lot of chasing around and Chucky saying lines like ""women, can't live with them...period."" which was never really Chucky. Chucky was funny because he took himself seriously and was a total jerk. Chucky was not the one-line Henny Youngman imitator that Freddy Krueger became.

By trying to recreate Chucky and the ""horror"" of the first movie, the screenwriters and director took out all the excitement and fun, leaving us with a by-the-numbers horror movie that plods along without much to offer anyone.",1403049600,,1512,4.514598540145985

However, after seeing Curse of Chucky, I was very glad I got it. It is a return to the more straight up horror of Child's Play rather than the comedic horror that Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky had been. I thought Chucky looked quite different than usual, but by the end of the movie, you see that there's a reason for it. From what I understand, this is a sequel to Child's Play 3, but makes references to events in Bride of Chucky. Either way, it's a great Chucky movie!",1397865600,,643,4.193548387096774
5855195,5,B00DTPRZ10,"After some comedic and outside-the-box detours in the ""Chucky"" series, it finally heads back home in ""Curse of Chucky,"" a lively new entry in the franchise. Much like Freddy Krueger's more sinister incarnation in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"" ""Curse"" reintroduces Chucky as more cunning than before. The plot surrounds the Pierce family reuniting after tragedy has struck. While most of the family acts sympathetically, others have serious tension. At the source of most of the tension is the self-serving, resentful Barb (Danielle Bisutti), older sister to Nica (Fiona Dourif), who rightfully holds her own against Barb's constant condescending comments. Amidst the drama, the Pierce household receives a Good Guy Doll in a package with an unknown sender. Nica decides to keep the doll as a gift for her niece, Alice. Nica, confined to a wheelchair, still proves to be as strong a horror heroine as any; resourceful, likeable, and a character to root for. The film moves at a great pace with enough blood, spot-on dialogue, and surprises to scare and satisfy horror and Chucky fans alike.",1397692800,,1089,5.15819209039548

5855197,3,B00DTPRZ10,"As a long time fan of the Child's Play series including the much maligned fourth and fifth installments with their wading into comedic territory I was both impressed yet dissapointed by Curse of Chucky. This is a pretty good story and a nice way to reinvigorate the franchise and go back to Chucky's roots. Due to its DTV budget the location are limited to one spooky old house which actually works in the film's favor. What doesn't work is the usually animatronic chucky having either CGI facial expressions or movements that look just plain amature as though they were done on some kid's computer. I don't know, maybe they were. The movie also has some amnesia seeming to forget what happened in the last installment's yet chucky looks like he was stiched together as he was in Bride and Seed yet you get the feeling that this movie does not exist in that universe. That really through me for the loop in as to where in the Child's Play timeline this took place. My final complaint is the 73 different endings tacked on. Why god why? Be confident, find a good ending and stick with it. The first ending is very bleak and then we get an ending with Tiffany which was great to see Jennifer and her ""Tillys"" again. THEN we are treated to a ridiculous ending with Chucky trying to play hide the soul with little girl from early in the film while some old lady only discussed early in the film has a bag over her head in the closet. Man, the chuck really gets around what with all these conclusions but then......*SPOILER* Chucky ends his magical murdering tour at the house of Andy from Child's Play 1 & 2. That scene was all too brief but probably the most appropriate and satisfying conclusions out of the many tacked on.",1397088000,,1721,4.501597444089457

  The package does not say who it is from. When Sarah opens it, it is a Good Guy doll. The mouth can move and it talks. They don't get the joke, so Sarah throws it in the trash outside.

The animation made him look so fake that it took away from all the scariness of the Chucky I remember.  While I did like the ending (the very end), overall I just wasn't feeling the movie.

5855224,3,B00DTPRZ10,"Written and directed by the franchise creator Don Mancini, Curse of Chucky goes back its origin as a slasher horror movie. The latest (and first straight-to-video) entry takes the premise of a killing doll rather seriously, with several 1980s-ish gory scenes. That means no more jokes of the last two sequels Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky.

Once again, we meet Chucky, a doll possessed by an evil soul of a serial killer. Brad Dourif provides the voice and also reprises the role of Charles Lee Ray. This time Chucky is sent to Sarah (Chantal Quesnelle), mother of a young woman Nica (Fiona Dourif). Next morning someone is found dead.

When Nicas sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) and her family arrive, you know what happens next. The problem is the films pacing, which flags here and there, especially in the first half of the film. Still, toward the end the film picks up the pace, with a few interesting twists and post-credits scene.

Curse of Chucky is a decent horror movie, throwback to the old slasher films, but don't expect big scares or over-the-top killings here.",1392422400,,1079,4.790322580645161
5855225,4,B00DTPRZ10,"I admit, I didn't go into this with the highest hopes for this installment. But I like this franchise and the trailer looked awesome (I love a good Old Dark House movie) so I rented it. I don't regret it. The characters are better than stock, and they have a connection to Chucky that plays out nicely over the course of the film. There are callbacks to the first movie that are most welcome, and an unexpected cameo at the end for fans of the later flicks. There is plenty of atmosphere thanks to the spooky old house, and an imperiled child is always a trope that can get your blood pumping. There's even a cliche that get turned on its ear, something that never gets old for me, especially in horror movies. The only thing I can really complain about is one act that features two unlikely character decisions that defy character motivation for the sole sake of moving the plot in a specific direction. I don't think I have to spell them out, I'm sure you'll know them when you see them. If not for that, I'd have given it all five stars. And I know, horror movies are famous for people doing the dumb thing and that's part of the charm, but this was so pointless it was impossible to ignore. Ah well, the rest of the movie was good.

Not sure what some other reviewers saw in this slow-moving, poorly done sequel. The Chucky doll has been redesigned, looking plumper and cuter up to a point. The amazing Brad Dourif shows up with not much to do. His daughter is in this as well.

There are a couple of good gore scenes, but lots and lots and lots and lots of dark rooms and people talking. And what the heck was the ending? Was there an ending? Or did some coked-up video editor just splice a bunch of loose pieces to close out the final minutes?

Hence the reason that The Childs Play series has just never done it for me.  Its a DOLL!  Its a three-foot tall doll!  Anyway, Chucky makes his for the sixth installment of the series in a story set four years after the events of the previous film, Seed of Chucky.  The Chucky doll arrives in a mysterious package at the home of wheelchair-bound Nica and her mother, Sarah.  Sarah tosses the doll into the trash but she dies later that night and the doll is found inside the home.

The following day Nicas sister Barb arrives with her husband Ian, daughter Alice, and live-in nanny, Jill to comfort the grieving Nicaand tell her they plan on moving her into an assisted living home and sell her house.  Nice.  When the family priest comes over for dinner, Chucky makes his first murderous move by pouring rat poison into a bowl of chili.  Throughout dinner we watch each member carefully trying to figure out which one got the tainted food.  Its virtually the films only suspenseful moment.

In between Chucky beginning his murderous rampage and attempting to possess the body of little Alice, we learn that Barb is actually having an affair with the nanny in a modern, PC twist to the usual husband banging the nanny.  Its all very tiresome and dull and offers nothing new.  Among the few pluses the film does offer is a cameo by Jennifer Tilly once again playing Chuckys wife Tiffany and an after credits cameo by Alex Vincent who played Andy Barclay way back in the original Childs Play.  This would be a great way to end the series but somehow I get the feeling that we won't be that lucky.",1390608000,2,1726,4.519354838709678
5855231,2,B00DTPRZ10,"Curse of Chucky(released Ay/13)stars,among others,Fiona Dourif,Danielle Bisutti,Brennan Elliott and Brad Dourif back as the voice of Chucky. As the 6th in the franchise's history,this is by FAR the worst of the bunch. The producers needed to go back and watch all the previous ones,because they failed to live up to the franchises lively dynamic and what made them so successful. Instead they use old worn tricks and shock elements that needn't have been included.
The story finds a mother and her paraplegic daughter(wheelchair bound) living alone. One day they get a package and it is a Chucky doll. By that night,the mother is dead. The next day the daughter's sister,husband,their daughter,nanny and a local priest drop by to offer condolences and comfort. They stay the evening for supper and Chucky is on the move. He sprinkles rat poison on the dinner,but we don't know whose. Out in the dining room it is the priest who starts feeling ill. He leaves and is killed in a car crash on the way home.
The sister and family decide to bunk in with her that night,which makes Chucky's night fun. It's storming out(typical,right?)and the little girl is afraid. He plays a game and locks her in a closet. With the girl out of the way,the nanny is the first to get it. Then as the mother tries to find her daughter,she gets hers while searching the attic. Her wheelchair bound sister has meanwhile had to drag herself way up the stairs and she arrives just as her sister falls down the attic stairs and into her lap. Chucky is in pursuit and she drags herself hurriedly into the sister's room and wakes the husband up who has had ear plus in. They flee into the garage. He goes back to try and find his daughter but finds the dead bodies instead. He comes back down to the garage,and ends up restraining her in her wheelchair upstairs,thinking she has done everything. While he checks his laptop,Chucky enters and pushes her wheelchair over him and then axes him. He then pushes her wheelchair through the railings and down to the floor below.
While she lays on the floor,barely alive,he explains that in human form he was Charles Lee Ray. He became a friend of her family,but it was him that killed her father,mother and made her a paraplegic in her mother's womb. While fleeing the cops he was able to put his soul into a Chucky doll,25 years before. Back i the present,when a cop arrives and see the carnage he arrests her and she is charged. She is eventually convicted and sentenced to life. As the cop leaves the courthouse with the Chucky doll in a bag,Jennifer Tilly from the previous movie pops up from behind and slits the cops throat. In a post office later,she is mailing Chucky to another address. At that address we see Chucky reunited with the little girl,now living with her grandmother. Chucky plays""hide the soul"" with her and recites an incantation. In a post credit scene we see the now grown up boy from the original film get the doll delivered to his house. As Chucky tries to make his move on him,his head is blown off.
The producers of this film,instead of following the Chucky bible,tried to randomly throw in every piece of horror schlock they could get by with. They use the old canard of a red herring. At the dinner table while we await someone getting sick from the poison,the husband suddenly says ""wait....wait...wait..."",like he is choking. Then he says""This is the best tasting chili I've ever had"".Lame. Then we have the shock value thrown in,for no reason. They allow Chucky to use profanity to a young girl. With adults is one thing,and we all know he would swear,but c'mon it looks terrible using it like that. Give your heads a shake. Then they throw in gratuitous lesbian sex,as the nanny and the girls mother go at it. There are lots of films that that kind of thing would be more appropriate in,but a horror film like this is no place for it. Then there are the endings,five of them to be exact! The film really should have ended around the moment the cop came and arrested the wheel chair bound daughter. Nope. We then go on to a courtroom scene where we see her sentencing carried out. I could have forgiven them that if they had ended it there. Nope. From here we see the cop taking Chucky in a bag in his car and Tilly popping up to off the cop. The end? No way. From here it's Tilly now at the post office mailing the doll to another victim. The end? You gotta be kidding me. From here we see Chucky reunited with the young girl now living with her grandmother who has been killed by Chucky. Ok,it's the end now,right? No. We get a post scene thing with a reuniting of Chucky with the young kid from the original Child's Play(how many people knew that?).Now is it done? Yes.....thankfully. A ridiculous way to end a movie and amateurish to boot. Then finally I must mention the priest's car accident. It was apparently a head on collision that somehow,beyond all logic,managed to take the roof right off the priests car(not the other guys).And of course,when they try and remove the priests body his head comes rolling off. The producers used the mantra,whether it makes sense or not,if we can get a scare,use it.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette,commentary,deleted scenes and a gag reel.
All in all a total let down by a crew of folks that didn't seem to have the first clue as to what made the first five so successful. They were using broad strokes from the Chucky bible and filling it in with any kind of horror schlock you would see in a million other horror films. It's easy to make a doll look as if it has come to life and is animated,the hard part is doing it smartly. This filmed missed the boat on all counts.

5855244,5,B00DTPRZ10,"CURSE OF CHUCKY

I have been a Chucky fan since the very first Childs Play came out all those years ago. He has been scary, funny, creepy, and awesome all throughout the entire franchise. So when I learned that a new sequel was in the works I could not wait for it. I have loved all of the films in the series so I knew that this would be no different. The same guy that has written all of them Don Mancini returned to not only write but direct like he did the last one previous Seed of Chucky.

Nica is a paraplegic woman who lives with her mother and receives a package one day out of the blue. Inside said package is a doll, a Good Guy doll, his name, Chucky. She has no idea why this came to her or who it is from but just thinks it is a mistake and thinks nothing of it. Later that night she is awaken by the sound of her mothers scream. Upon investigating she finds her dead apparently from committing suicide, it is later ruled that. Soon after her sister and her family come to stay with her as the house was left to both of them. One wants to sell but Nica knows this place as home. Nica gives the doll to her little niece and the family settles in along with a priest that her older sister has brought to comfort her. But as the night goes on something is not right as her niece is talking to the doll as if it is talking back to her and family secrets are about to come out. Oh yeah did a mention that there is a serial killer doll in the house, what fun.

In all honesty this may be the best sequel in the entire franchise. It is a return to the horror roots of the franchise much like the first ones but also retains some of the dark humor that the later ones became famous for. And for those wondering this is not a remake or reimaging, it is in fact a sequel that does a wonderful job of tying all the films together. Don like always has done a wonderful job with this film and you can tell he really cares about the character he created. The film feels and looks like the first one and the atmosphere is great. The film takes place almost entirely in one day in the house which for some reason I have always loved movies that take place in one day.

Acting wise you know Brad Dourif is excellent as Chucky and as the returning Charles Lee Ray. The movies would be nothing without him as the voice of the franchise. But it is his daughter Fiona Dourif that surprised me most here. This is the first film I have seen her in although I know she is on the series True Blood. She is excellent here as paraplegic Nica and really comes across as natural. Everyone in the film does a great job as everyone was believable in their roles.

This is a great Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack with all kinds of great special features. You get a commentary that is informative. Also we get all kinds of behind the scenes and a little documentary on the series. I really enjoyed this film and the special features bump it up to a five star for me. Also stay tuned after the credits for a bonus scene, a must see.",1389657600,3,3002,4.089983022071308
5855245,5,B00DTPRZ10,"I loved the first few but now they are getting out of hand, Maybe the suspense isn't there anymore but getting the story across isn't to bad but needs better performances by the cast, more convincing should help. The doll is up to the usual stuff that everyone knows about and starting to go downhill. I was expecting something better than last time, but disappointed so a not to scary chucky needs to change a bit. I rated this an B grade for tolerance but that is all I can say. The cast didn't do anything for the movie that took it out of tempo. Better to watch with a group so you can have time out during the show. Enjoy!",1389571200,,627,4.190082644628099

I love the first movie, the second one eh, okay I guess, and then I don't know anything about the others. I just couldn't get into this one. Its great they are still making them (I guess???) but I didn't like it. I didn't like that it was set in an old stereotypical goth house full of black furnishings, fake old trees in the yard, just very cliche and uninspired. The first movie has a realism to it (yeah I know its based on a doll that is keeping a mans soul, but come on) because its in a city, in an apartment, you get to follow Andy around and see the story unfold in different and creepy ways. This movie sits in a house the whole time. I was very surprised when I went online and saw all the good reviews and my sister said that it was rated highly. Okay I thought, and I was really looking forward to it. Still it wasn't all bad I guess. But worth a watch? Maybe on Netflix. I surely wouldnt buy it. Hope my sister doesnt see this. I thought the story was silly, the scares very few (are none actually), characters contrived, plot beyond contrived, and boring staying in a typical horror movie house. Shame on you Chucky!

5855266,5,B00DTPRZ10,"I'm a fan of all of the Child's Play movies, and for years, I thought the second one was the best one. It was the first to explicitly show Chucky committing acts for which his human self is known, and like its predecessor, it focused on horror. While 3 did, it had some elements which made the film less believable, and Bride and Seed were more along the lines of horror comedies, entertaining but less memorable. Curse of Chucky abandons the comedy in favor of the horror with which the series began, and that means fewer wise-cracks, less gore for the sake of gore, but plenty of suspense. For example, the first death of the film occurs shortly after Chucky poisons one meal of a dinner for a family of six, and it is not immediately clear who the unfortunate victim is (in fact, you're led to believe that it is someone else). On the subject of victims, the ones in this movie are the first ones since Tiffany in Bride to not be victims of circumstance. Chucky, or more appropriately,  Charles Lee Ray, has a good reason to kill this family, and while I will not divulge that reason, I will say that watching to find out is worthwhile, and anyone who's missed Andy Barclay will get to see him again. I certainly enjoyed that. The longest in the series and starring Brad Dourif's daughter, Curse of Chucky is a memorable experience from start to finish. You've probably heard ""Don't f### with the Chuck"" before, but I guarantee you'll understand it after this.",1388275200,2,1463,4.541666666666667

Here the slate is wiped clean and Chucky has inexplicably pulled himself together again (LOL) to return. This time he has started with a new family and a whole new story line. It reminded me a lot of the original film. There is a long gradual build-up as if we are being introduced to Chucky for the first time.
So if you're a big fan ready to jump right into the killings, you'll be a bit disappointed.

Martinez, even though his part was relatively small. Chucky sure has gone through some facial changes since Child's Play 3.  Even with the scars and stitches, he has an even more menacing look.  I would like to know why the Play Pal company keeps putting this doll back together?  I don't get that.  Of course, Chucky keeps getting away with a lot more killings and innocent people who are trying to stop him get blamed for them, tried, and convicted to an insane asylum.  I liked it after Fiora got sentenced in court and the Chucky doll was on the evidence table,she wheeled by it in her wheelchair and taunted Chucky that she was still alive.  Then she gave a little evil laugh.  I also enjoyed her taunting Chucky about his failure in never being able to kill Andy. Chucky got real PO'd about that. There is a surprise on the DVD after all the credits have run (unrated version) that picks up on action 6 months after the mayhem in this movie but I won't spill the beans.

Curse of Chucky (2013) **
D: Don Mancini
C: Fiona Dourif, Danielle Bisutti, Brennan Elliott, Maitland McConnell, Chantal Quesnel, Summer Howell, A Martinez, Brad Dourif
P: Chucky returns in this 6th installment in the Child's Play franchise to terrorize a troubled family during the middle of a raging storm.

Bride of Chucky was a welcome departure from the norm. It featured Jennifer Tilly in a perfectly realized comedic performance. With Seed of Chucky, Chucky had become something of a joke and was no longer scary. So returning the franchise back to its horror roots and taking a more serious approach to the material was a smart idea.

While I applaud their decision to take the material more seriously, Curse of Chucky, unfortunately, just doesn't understand how to craft suspense and terror. They have a Gothic mansion. It takes place during a thunder storm. The villain of the film is a possessed doll and there is something inherently creepy about dolls to begin with. So they have the foundation for what could have been a scary film in place.

The problem with Curse of Chucky is that almost all of its suspense is so far telegraphed in advance, that you can see it coming from a mile away. The cast tiptoes around a Gothic mansion during a storm. Chucky appears in the background oblivious to the film's characters. Que the music score. One girl gets undressed. We know she has it coming to her and so on and so on.

One character is a kid. She's the innocent one caught in the mix. Some of the characters are jerks. Some are greedy schemers. Another character is helpless and misunderstood by everyone in general. It's pretty easy to figure the order in which everyone is going to get their just desserts. They're not really characters, but fodder for Chucky's mischievous mayhem.

The original Child's Play showed some innovation when it came to Chucky's carnage, but there's no innovation to be found here. Chucky had some clever one liners in the original Child's Play. There's none here. There's a few plot twists, one too many in fact. Sometimes less is more.

Curse of Chucky is just another bland, uninspired horror film that coasts on the goodwill established by the original Child's Play. It just happens to have an iconic horror film villain to distinguish itself. Otherwise, this is pretty forgettable stuff. [R] 97 mins.",1386028800,,2411,4.880195599022005

5855307,2,B00DTPRZ10,"This is perhaps the worst Chucky Movie I have ever seen. when it was first released, I thought that like halo and GOW: Judgement, it was going to suck...I was right. The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it tells the before story to when Charles (at the time when he is still human) was running away from the police and ended up in the doll. Put that part of the movie aside, this blowed EPICLY. Sure there's a lez-like scene, but where's the blood, the suspense, the stuff that actually makes a horror movie decent. I almost think of this as the Aliens: Resurrection of the Chucky series. Its pretty easy to tell that the wheelchair aunt is going to be the lone survivor of the movie, while the kid is transferred away somewhere else. I mean, who is chucky trying to go for? The kid? Nica? and near the end *SPOILER (DO NOT READ IF YOU WISH TO WATCH)-------------- Chuck's wife pops out of the back seat of a cop car to get back Chucky. She is Human agin...and Blond Bimbo human, not Kim Kardashian. That's a bit of a screw up. What happen?------------------------- Plus, Where's Chuck's kid?

Trying to wrap this up, the writers really under-thought the movie, BIG TIME. I never really thought the movies got better (the first and maybe CP 2 being the only good ones), but this is the worst and DESERVES to be uncredited by all. I'm just glad that they are done.

NOTHING will ever erase the bad memories of SEED OF CHUCKY one of the worst movies ever made...but this is a new horror classic.  Een the ending was a great surprise giving much needed background detail on CHARLES LEE RAY! The house was old and creepy...there was an elevator just as in CHILDS PLAY 2, and the script did not exploit the disabled woman. In fact--I was expecting CHucky to say something offensive to her...but they left that tro the bitchy sister. I LOVED this movie.

5855316,5,B00DTPRZ10,"After a near 9 year absence, everyone's favorite murderous doll, Chucky returned! When I first saw the trailer for the film, I wasn't interested in it too much because of how different Chucky looked but after giving it some time, I gave in, realized how creepier the new and improved Chucky looked and I'm proud to see it's in the 5 star section on my DVD shelf.

The plot of the movie revolves around paraplegic, Nica, who lives with her mother Sarah. One afternoon, a package comes in the mail for Nica and it turns out to be Chucky inside of the box. Later that night, Sarah is mysteriously found dead via stab wound and her death is ruled as a suicide. The next day, Nica's older sister, Barb arrives, accompanied by her husband, Ian; daughter, Alice; live-in nanny, Jill; and Father Frank, a priest. Alice finds Chucky and keeps him. During dinner, Chucky secretly poisons a bowl of chili that Father Frank ends up eating and is later killed in a fatal car crash.

Let me just say right off the bat that Barb (Danielle Bisutti) does too much of a good job at playing the bitch sister. You almost have a major disdain for the character as soon as she arrives on the screen. Back to the movie though. Later that night as everyone is sleeping, Nica has a suspicious feeling about Chucky and takes it upon herself to do some internet research on the doll, where she learns of Chucky's murderous history. From there on out, the family must survive the night and escape Chucky's wrath, but unfortunately most of them fall victim to him and die very gruesome deaths.

An interesting thing to note about Curse of Chucky is that the movie returns to it's horror roots, whereas the last 3 Chucky films mixed horror and comedy. No humor here. Just horror at it's best. There's a bit of a shocking twist at the end of the movie that explains how the events of the first Child's Play movie came about. But the surprises don't stop there, as in the post-credits, we take a visit to a certain someone and I'll leave it that. To find out what these surprises are truly all about, you'll have to buy the movie....or just search the internet for spoilers. But I highly recommend buying this movie.

5855320,2,B00DTPRZ10,"I really didn`t like this movie.
Chucky had so much potential from the beginning, with a really successful series going, but what happens after the series has made enough money for the entire crew to retire and live the rest of their lives without doing anything to make money ever again? Well, in this particular case, Curse of Chucky happened.
Let me start off by saying that I was really excited for this movie. Like, REALLY excited. About five minutes into the movie, my excitement was running low, and by the half-hour mark, I was lost.
**FROM HERE ON IN, THERE ARE SPOILERS... ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK**
Let me first discuss what`s wrong with this movie (brace yourself)
There are no really likeable characters. In the first three movies, it was Andy Barclay. You could have sympathy for that kid, man. In Bride and Seed, there were people you cared about as well, but when it comes to Curse... I didn`t care who died, who lived, and if they all died in the end.
They gave Chucky a new look... I`m sure that`s the first thing everyone noticed about the movie. They gave him a new look, and now he looks like a GIRL. They should keep him looking like the original Child`s Play Chucky... no more changing his appearance!
The maid was a lesbian... and with her employer! That isn`t something I would have expected from Chucky; it hasn`t been done in any of the other movies. And if they were paying any attention, they would have realized that by adding homosexuality into the movie (it wasn`t even relevant to the plot, a few minutes of almost pornography) was going to ruin it. I mean, look at Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2... don`t even go there.... never mind...
They made the movie so confusing with people just coming into the movie and disappearing for long enough for us to completely forget about them (they are all forgettable anyway).

Now, I`ll point out what`s good:
We get a nice flashback to Charles Lee Ray, and we see his relationship with the family in the film.
Despite the multiple flaws, it IS Chucky.
Fiona Dourif (Brad`s daughter) is in this movie. Can you imagine the memories she would have... telling her kids her father tried to kill her when his soul was in a doll?
So, it has it`s flaws and it`s positives... but in the end, Curse of Chucky is a rotten finale to the series. That being said, I heard Don Mancini was preparing a reboot to the franchise. Let`s hope he does a better job with the reboot than with the last three movies.",1384473600,,2464,4.5

This film, for example, didn't have the magic.  Like the saying goes, ""you may have the words, but you don't have the music"".

There was deaths, a bit of blood, silly one liners, and the typical ""hide and seek"" sequences you expect from a Child's Play, but you can tell that it is lip service.  The actors don't seem real, and not really invested in the project.  The camera angles seems half-assed or poorly thought out.  Even the doll seems to have little planning involved, it is not creative or thoughtful to merely slap a float of plastic over the scars!

5855356,4,B00DTPRZ10,"*****SPOILER ALERT*****

I will admit after reading the reviews, I was expecting it to be no good and ready to push stop on the dvd player. But It was a good Movie that goes back to the Horror like it was in the first 2. Yes, the doll looks different compared to the doll they used in the previous movies, Did they lose the original doll or they destroyed it somewhere? I don't know... The only problem I would have is towards the end of the movie, Chucky ends up with the little girl. after killing grandma, He finally gets a child alone to transfer his soul into a human body but in the next scene, Charles is still in the good guy doll. Whats up with that?",1383350400,2,659,4.1484375
5855357,4,B00DTPRZ10,"I must admit that I am not a huge fan of the Child's Play franchise. The first film scared the crap out of me (child of the 80's here), but it all got pretty silly after that (not that a voodoo possessed doll is a serious premise to begin with, but I digress...).

Anyway, I've casually watched the plethora of sequels since. Much like the latter films of the Nightmare on Elm franchise, they took a turn for self parody and camp. Camp is fine and good, but it is an acquired taste. I understand that CP has an audience. I can only give casual accounts of the franchise of a whole because I've never been very invested in it.

That said, I was not expecting an iota of horror goodness from this film. Initially rumored to be a REMAKE, Curse of Chucky works as a tidy little tie in film that explains the franchise from beginning to end (for the most part). In fact, I think the approach is EXTREMLY smart: instead of a true blue ""remake,"" this film works as a back to basics revamping (or laying to rest, depending on your view) of the series. Again: extremely surprised and pleased by the intelligent choices made here. Bringing Brad Dourif back and casting his daughter Fiona as the handicapped protagonist= brilliant moves.

Moreover, this movie--while far from brilliant or ""film of the year""--has more suspense in it and clever pacing than most horror movies released in the last few years. Some of the humor of the series remains in tact, as well as one liners from Chucky, but the device is used sparingly. Curse of Chucky is a darker film than its predecessors and takes itself as seriously as it can (and this is a good thing).

I would highly recommend this film to the diehard CP fan as well as the casual viewer. If you liked the first film, then I doubt that you won't at least appreciate this one for what it is.

Recap: spooky staging/set, great pacing, FX (gore is great), acting (better than average for the genre), THOUGHTFUL script/ clever and creative use of back story.

Ps- Be sure to watch the movie in its entirety, credits and all. There is a cute cameo at the end. I won't give away, but longtime fans will appreciate it, as well as genre fans who attend horror conventions.",1383350400,,2200,4.460199004975125

They redid Chucky which I personally didn't like too much and could have sworn that I heard that he was meant to be in CGI.

The other was that the whole movie takes place in a mansion never leaving the home, not even outside.

Being a fan of the Child's Play/Chucky franchise I've seen this doll reinvented several times. The new movie additions have changed from horror to horror comedy over the years and have kept fans of this franchise somewhat pleased.

However, after I found out that Don Mancini was releasing another Chucky movie I had to see it!! Rented the movie, popped it into the DVD player and became overwhelming disappointed.

As you can tell by watching the previews, the dolls have been altered. Chucky is redone and looks different, no complaints from me. However, the story line starts off with a young girl who is wheelchair bound and her mother living together. The mother received a mysterious package that contains a good guy doll. The mother is found dead the next morning, the young girl's sister and her husband, child and nanny come to visit due to the mother's death.

The sister is having a affair with the nanny and the husband is just stupid. The child is now Chucky's best buddy and attaches to the doll instantly.

After everyone is slathered leaving the wheelchair bound girl fighting for her life it is discovered that Chucky when he was in his human body was a friend of the family or I guess, because this part of the movie was never fully explained.

All and all this movie sucks.. I hope someone other than the creator Don Mancini creates the next Chucky movie because if not this franchise will suck!",1383177600,,1439,4.645669291338582
5855366,4,B00DTPRZ10,"From the first couple of minutes it's easy to tell that Don Mancini is treating Curse more as a horror film than the previous couple of entries in the series. The movie is shot and edited to build suspense and is a world apart from the sitcom trappings of Seed.

A girl in a wheelchair (Brad Dourif's hot daughter Fiona) living in a rural home with her troubled mother receives a mysterious package one afternoon. It's Chucky, and he's somehow managed to get himself in the mail again. He's arrived to settle a score, and soon enough he has brainwashed a child into keeping his secret and is sneaking about in the shadows offing unsuspecting victims.

Many people are saying that this movie is a return to form, and that it retcons Bride and Seed out of existence. Er...no, the film very much DOES acknowledge the events of Bride and Seed. Even if you paid the bare minimum of attention it would be hard to not to realize this. But I guess that expecting the movie to go in a different direction only led to further surprises when it eventually did tie in to the previous movies as well as giving us more back-story to Charles Lee Ray.

I was worried that Chucky would be all CGI as Kevin Yagher has not been involved with the series since Bride, and while there IS some CGI, he's anamatronic for the most part. Instead of hogging the camera though he keeps quiet watches the humans interact for about half the movie before unleashing toy terror. Horror composer Joseph LoDuca delivers a pastiche of the Renzetti, Revell, and Donaggio's efforts without giving Curse a signature sound of its own. Not really a complaint, but more of a missed chance.

It's certainly a worthy sequel and a can be viewed as a genuine horror film without any of the guilty pleasure of Seed. Keep watching to the end of the credits for a further surprise that ties the series together even more (though it does contradict the closing scene before the credits actually roll).

Curse is significantly superior to Seed when it comes to cinematography. The movie was shot in ProRes 4:4:4 by Michael Marshall, who mainly has experience in Canadian TV shows. While I do not doubt that the movie would look better on 35mm film I still have no complaints regarding the picture quality. It's clean, it's sharp, the blacks are bold and colors sparkle. The DTS HD-MA sound is not without stingers, but they're smartly done. A decent amount of extras are included.",1383091200,3,2430,4.6157407407407405

But I am also a fan of the Chucky series of films. The first horror film I ever decided to voluntarily sit through as a youth was the second film in the canon, a movie I still think holds up. But as the series progressed, the campier they became, culminating in Seed of Chucky a movie that is...notwell..lets just leave it at not.
But Ive always got a soft spot in my heart for my favorite of all the movie-monsters, continually brought to life through the voice of Brad Dourif (who was nominated for an Oscar for One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest [which is a fact that NOT a lot of people know]). So when Curse of Chucky, the new film starring Dourifs REAL LIFE Daughter Fiona Dourif came out, I knew I had wanted to see it.

But before I go into my review, let me give you a segue: when I was in film school, the director I studied the most was Alfred Hitchcock. Say what you will about his later films (I still really enjoy Torn Curtain), but the man KNEW how to drive you wild with a camera angle, music, or a subtle glance. Sometimes all of those things at the same time.
Watching this film was like watching a Childs Play movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock, only it was directed (as well as written) by series creator Don Mancini, who really goes balls-out in creating mood, atmosphere, chills, gore and most of all: LIKEABLE characters. Yes, thats right: characters we actually enjoy as people. Fiona Dourifs Nica is not only likeable, but shes a character you WANT to succeed.
Horror (as well as a most of cinema itself the last few years), has become a cesspool of cliched dialog spoken by carbon-copied characters in a style-less/coverage driven garbage pile that tries to lobotomize you into enjoying whatever youve chosen to Redbox that evening. Sure, theres ALWAYS been bad horror, but never has the mainstream stuff been so...happily generic.
We meet Nica, a single gal living with her painter Mom in an old-yet-cool house. Mom receives a mysterious package (spoiler alert: its Chuck) and murderousness ensues, especially after Nicas sister Barb brings her family to live with Nica and try to convince her to sell the house to make some good paper off of it. Theres a priest, a nanny, a suspicious husband, a cute (not annoying) kid, and an elevator.
Fiona Dourif is pretty dang great, creating a sympathetic yet strong protagonist and is a great counter to the role her pop is playing, that of the Good Guy doll with a killer snark. But this movie isn't ABOUT Chucky killing people. As a matter of fact, the first time you see Chucky actually kill someone comes pretty late in the movie, which is a great choice by Mancini. He shows quite an astounding display of sleight of hand here, using camera angles, SLOW camera movements, lighting effects, a window, a storm, etc., to tension you deeper into the film.
You know: how they USED to make movies. The kinds that Scorsese and Spielberg constantly put on their all-time-favorites lists.
By the time you reach the end of the movie, not only are you satisfied with the story, but you're very happy with the overall EXPERIENCE of the it, something that has long disappeared in the days of heightened focus groups.
Sometime ago (on instagram), I created the hashtag #cinemafirst, in an attempt to a) teach my followers about the power of cinema and b) have them demand more from it. We need more movies like Curse of Chucky in terms of how they're presented to us: an art form done in a stylish way with interesting characters that made you feel good after watching it. However, if all you want to see if s***ty people get killed in creative ways, then to each their own. But YOURE the reason that the art form behind film is dying and when theres nothing good out anymore, when you're at redbox or on netflix looking for something interesting to watch and you just cant see anything youd want to spend your time on...youre to blame.
Aspiring filmmakers should watch this film so they can remember HOW TO MAKE A MOVIE. #cinemafirst

5855370,5,B00DTPRZ10,"I like how the new and the old combined chucky. I purchased the blue ray DVD and it came in 3 copies, one being a digital and of course I would trust amazon to download it from. Great movie to any chucky fan, despite that it isn't the original but still is a classic.",1382918400,,267,3.962962962962963
5855371,4,B00DTPRZ10,"When I heard that there was another Child's Play movie on the way I was skeptical.  The last two left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't want another sorry attempt at a comedy.  I was also skeptical because I heard this one was coming direct-to-video.  I've seen a number of direct-to-video horror releases and the good ones are few and far between.  I am happy to say that this is actually one of the better video releases I've seen.  The acting was pretty good, the effects were better than I had hoped.  I was a little lost as far as how this family tied into the cannon, there is a black and white flashback and it was a little vague, however I didn't let that distract from the rest of the film.  If you enjoyed the first three films you should check this one out.  BTW this was a rental on Amazon, not a purchase.",1382918400,,821,4.151898734177215
5855372,5,B00DTPRZ10,"I thought this movie would not be as good as the others in the series, but it did not disappoint one bit! This has to be the best straight-to-video sequel and best straight-to-video horror movie I have ever seen, and I love the direction the series takes in this film.",1382832000,3,268,4.38
5855373,4,B00DTPRZ10,"Only minutes into the movie I was already shocked at the production quality.  Immediately evident were some gorgeous efforts on cinematography in the early shots and the acting feels fresh and credible, unlike most stale to stagnant-flavored wooden acting of even ""decent quality"" horror.  Also slapping me in the face for attention, the camera work is thoughtful and innovative for the first time in the franchise.  This sequel/pseudo-reboot may not hold a candle to Evil Dead (2013) or Carrie (2013), but clearly more love and consideration went into this film than to simply capitalize on horror fans' fealty with more advanced CGI to supplement the effects.

Nica (Fiona Dourif; True Blood, The Master) is a gorgeous wheelchair-bound young woman living with her mother (Chantal Quesnelle), who is sweet but over-protective to the point of inhibiting Nica's self-confidence.  They receive a package from an anonymous sender containingyou guessed it: a Good Guy doll!  After her mother is murdered, Nica's sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti; Insidious 2) brings her daughter (Alice) and nanny (Jill) for the funeral.  Alice quickly falls in love with Chucky and people start to die.

We encounter the same classic tells.  The doll never seems to be where people left it, it appears in strange places, and young Alice makes vague suggestions that Chucky can move on his own (e.g., ""He's hiding"").

Brad Dourif (The Hazing, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Dune) returns to voice the iconic Chucky and his daughter Fiona does a fine job as well.  The only fault I found in the acting was some soap opera star playing an incredibly unconvincing priest and other actors in other minor roles.

The kills were alright.  Nothing special, but still fun.  I'd say the same about the writing.  There were some cheap tactics (e.g., a lesbian adultery scenario) but overall this film was an enjoyable success.

Directed and written (characters) by Don Mancini--who took part in writing all of the Child's Play franchise installments (1988-2013) and several related short films as well as directing Seed of Chucky (2004)--was limited to a DTDVD release after the understandably subpar performance of Bride of Chucky (1998) and Seed of Chucky (2004).  However, the quality of the present film suggests that the rumored Chucky 7 should find its way to a theatrical release.

Curse of Chucky is tactful and shows restraint.  It's not until halfway through the film that we hear Chucky's voice or see him killing onscreen.  After the outlandishly farcical events and pacing of the last two movies, this is just what the franchise needed--a return to its roots!  No more jokes or fooling around; just the sort of plain old-fashioned malevolence that could make homicidal dolls menacing again.

Watch this and enjoy.  The end does a fine job linking the stories of the movies together and you should stay through the credits for one last franchise cameo.",1382832000,,2938,5.0623700623700625
5855374,5,B00DTPRZ10,"Okay, you're not going to be able to completely remake this movie and yes there is probably movies that are scarier but if you are a fan of the original series this is definitely a step forward not back.

5855376,2,B00DTPRZ10,"All I can say is, if you're a Chucky fan like me and you must watch this movie, like I did (sadly), rent it, invite a few friends over and tell them to contribute like fifty cents each because even after renting it you'll feel like you've wasted your money. WOW! I honestly believe that this was an attempt to get Fiona Dourif's foot in the door, whom I think is a good actress but man, she could've gotten a way better role than this!! This was a disservice to her career and a disservice to my Friday night. I can't register why they've allowed this to be seen by the public. I have to give it to them on the suspense though. The suspense was good; it was a little dragged but it was good suspense but it went downhill once Chucky started to reveal himself. He's just not as sneaky and creative in this film and the killings all take place in ONE HOUSE (that is all I'm giving away, I swear). If I wanted to watch a horror movie where the killings took place in one house, I would've watched Amityville Horror or something, get my drift? That's not Chucky's style; Chucky is usually on a mission, going out of his way to find his victim and killing anybody who gets in the way. Maybe there wasn't enough in the budget for all of that. I'm more disappointed because I had high expectations. I thought this was going to be the savior of the Chucky franchise's reputation. I was rooting for you guys, but, since the Seed of Chucky, they have disappointed once again. I've been watching Child's Play since I was a little girl, loved it then and for some reason [still] love the potential. I still have hope that they can come up with something better. I'm a loyal Chucky fan (and I'm a fan of only a few things, trust me, I'm picky), and even after this disaster I look forward to what they have in store. With that said, this is more of a prequel, and the back story was pathetic. They should've hired me, I would've came up with something better. Give me the job!!! I'll bring Chucky back!! There was no passion in this film; you can tell when a film is made just to make a quick buck. They took advantage of the Chucky brand, that's all. Go in with low expectations, don't expect much creativity. I give it a two star for the suspense.",1382745600,3,2236,4.263529411764706
5855377,5,B00DTPRZ10,"I just finished watching all the Child's Play films so that I could get ready for the new one, and it blows most of them out of the water!! Great acting, awesome cinematography, and best of all, it's scary!!!!! Where Bride of Chucky succeeded because of the Scream-style meta comedy-horror angle, Curse of Chucky succeeds through the suspenseful buildup and exciting payoff of good old-fashioned horror! I can't believe this movie was straight to video! I hope Universal will put some more dough into making a seventh film to be released into theatres, because where so many horror reboots have been so-so, this one finally breaks the chain. Loved it!",1382659200,,651,4.927272727272728
5855378,4,B00DTPRZ10,"I was impressed with this straight to video addition to the Child's Play family of films. I believe it could have opened in theatres and made bank.

The cast was great with Fiona Dourif ""Nica"" giving the best performance, of course Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky was just as menacing as he was in the original. Danielle Busutti was good as the wide eyed Barb sister of the wheelchair bound Nica who finds her mother dead in a huge puddle of blood.
There was lots of blood and gore. One of the best scenes being a decapitation via auto accident.

The plot was good and totally enthralling. It centers around a family brought together by the death of the mother of two sisters one of the sisters husband and there young daughter who make friends with the deadly Chucky.keep watching until the credits finish for a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this film and highly recommend  it to Genre lovers.",1382659200,3,899,4.537037037037037

5855381,5,B00DTPRZ10,"In a time where evil dolls just aren't cool anymore, studios have ""Curse Of Chucky"" going directly to dvd. But this film is far superior to at least 3 of the series sequels, if not all of them.

This movie begins with ""Chucky"" being sent to what would seem to be a random location/family. Of course, bodies pile up. Something that really works is Chucky's ""friend til the end"" being a girl, and that out of a whole suitcase of random dolls, she likes him the best. But they don't play the rehash card-she isn't right there, being ridiculed and blamed for everything...

Chucky's ""Curse"" isn't revealed quite as much as one would hope, but how he ended up in that toystore is explained in full, and just how crazy he was b4 becoming a killer doll is also explained. This is his connection to this family.

By all means, it is scary, suspenseful, and disturbing, like the films were prior to ""Bride."" I liked Bride, but it was a little silly at times, and ""Seed"" was just stupid. This isn't like them at all, even though SPOILER ALERT! ""Tiffany"" does show up and while it's a small role, it really brought the movie full circle, and allowed everything to make sense while not being plaqued by ""Seed"".

If I have to rate this in the series, it's definitely better than the terrible ""Seed,"" as well as the rather poorly made ""Child's Play 3,"" and despite the fun it's still better than ""Bride."" I'd compare this to the levels of horror ""Child's Play 2"" had, and honestly, it's just as if not more creepy due to the use of modern tech. And when I say modern tech, I mean better animatronics. This should've been released to theatres. I look forward to another film if it's half as good as this one.

Any fan of Child's Play must see this, even if you hated the last three (3, Bride, Seed) or loved them all (besides Seed, maybe). This is what Child's Play is meant to be.",1382572800,10,1866,4.397101449275362

The story builds up well with some gruesome kills and very cool chucky doll effects, most of them are practical but some are CGI for certain things we haven't seen chucky do before like walking down stairs etc. The story does take the series full circle linking it to the original and other sequels, plus we get a few nice cameos towards the end, the ending is slightly confusing as there is a cool after credit scene which im not sure fits in but is a good nod for the fans, overall its really worth checking out if your a fan, its fits in so well with the rest of this amazing horror gem of a franchise, the picture quality is outstanding on the Blu-ray, and there are plenty of great features!!!",1382313600,2,1013,4.28125

You take a horror movie icon, and do another ""remake""?...I call it a remake because it dosent continue from where the series left off. Then take the main character , remove 80% of his dialog , and stick him in one dark house on a rainy night? YAWN.....Yeah this might be the worst one yet.

That being said I didn't find Chucky as creepy or threatening as he normally is in the movies.  For the most part they went around looking for him as opposed to him hunting them down and most of the movie took place in a house during a thunderstorm...so it seems a bit clich.  There isn't a lot of gore and the special effects aren't the greatest but hey it's Chucky, he's your friend to the end.

IT wasn't until the end, that the real puppetiers bring chucky to life!  and Jennifer Tilly, is the only good thing about this movie. Well that and at least they hired the orginal actor for Chucky.

Better than any direct to video in years and will make you forget the couple of not so good Child's Play sequels (I did enjoy Bride of Chucky and Child's Play 2). The last few minutes are when it gets good and then please by all means wait for the perfect gift at the end of the credits! Too many horror movies have goofy wait for another sequel moments at the end, this one had a much better idea and executed it with style.

The whole movies isn't great but when Mancini lets you in on the storyline toward the end it is ok you see no relation to the early movies at the beginning. If your buying or renting a Child's Play / Chucky movie you can obviously get through what seems like some standard fare if you know there is some candy waiting for you as the film wraps up. I would argue it almost deserves a Child's Play name as they style is dark and much more like the first or second movie though as the film ends the title of the film works. I just don't think you should start the film expecting anything like the fun roadshow 'Bride of Chucky' or disaster 'Seed of Chucky' (my opinions) that also had Chucky in the title.

I don't really care that the doll itself changed slightly, the Charles Lee Ray serial killer is still in the Good Guy doll and he still wants to cause havoc. The movie returns back to the maniacal roots of the first three, with less comedy and more gruesome killings.

I will say that this time around they veered away from the outright silliness of the last two films  which I admit I also immensely enjoyed and still watch regularly  and went with a more classical horror approach, recapturing the serious suspense of the first two or three Chucky movies, which is something longtime fans should appreciate. Others have touted it as being boring, but I don't see it that way at all. The gore and special effects were very well done for the kind of budget they were working with, and the acting was surprisingly up to par, for the most part, with Fiona Dourif really holding her own in the lead role. The last ten minutes or so did sort of feel like a hodgepodge of random scenes spliced together in rapid succession, like maybe the editor just wanted to get home in time for dinner that day, lol, but it still manages to all wrap up nicely, and I do suggest watching past the end credits for an extra surprise.

5855406,3,B00DTPRZ10,"Chucky is back, and back in form. The movie kicks off with Chucky being delivered to a house where a mother and her crippled daughter live (The daughter is played by Brad Dourif's real life daughter). Chucky ends up killing the mother, without the daughter knowing of him inside the doll. Her sister and her husband come to stay with her and bring along their nanny and little daughter. There is a long stint of boredom, but then when Chucky goes in for the kill it begins to pick up the pace. It's probably been expected by many fans that Chucky would eventually end up in the care of a girl. Chucky does what he does; the girl knows he is alive, but the adults don't beleive her. Chucky kills, and makes a few decent gore moments, probably the best ever seen in a Chucky movie that wasn't done for a laugh reaction.

The end was a surprise. You think through most of the movie if this is supposed to be a remake, or how the heck Chucky is alive and living in the doll once again. In the end, all if revealed. Especially the biggest question of why Chucky looks restored to his original look. Make sure you don't give in and turn it off, and stick it out to the end.

5855415,2,B00DTPRZ10,"*Review contains Spoilerish information*

Not sure where to begin.  I started out watching with an open mind regarding the plot and style, especially given the long duration since the last chucky movie hit the big screen.  And I also took into account that this went straight to dvd, so i considered the available budget as well.  At first, I was settling into it.  But, i have to be honest, the presence of chucky felt lacking for me.  The dialogue just was not there, not enough for me.  Now, if the plot was providing this great build up in the meantime, this aspect probably could have been forgiven some.  Perhaps it even had to do with budget, afterall, the more lines, the more they have to pay Brad Douriff.  But i still felt the disconnect.  And i felt such a plot could have been developed better.  I mean, we jump from a plot in Child's Play which has Charles Lee Ray being chased by the cops, only to be stranded and left behind by an accomplice, Eddie, to the implied scenario in Curse of Chucky that one of his surviving victims ratted him out somehow, while being held captive, and that's how he ended up at the toy store being chased down?  Yeah, i sense some revisionist history with that one.

Also wasn't quite sure what to make regarding the new look on the doll.  It was ... weird and unfamiliar at times, I'm sorry, but it was.  Now, at one point, i did question if the 'weird look' was intentional inside of the story because it was masking his 'real look' being covered up by whoever sent him.  Who knows though.

The time period for this movie does appear to cover the whole chucky era.  I believe chucky mentions 25 years, which would span 1988 to the present time, 2013.  So, the revelation near the end with Tiffany, appears to reveal that she's still in the picture - assuming her old identity|look and having chucky delivered door to door to resolve unfinished business.  Plus, the ending with adult Andy is an added surprise.  But, i have to be honest, i don't understand how we jumped from chucky being sent to the little girl to play hide the soul to still being in the doll and finding Andy last?  I mean, did chucky decide not to transfer his soul?  The ending gets a bit confusing there, like it tried to 'pay homage' and be the movie conclusion at the same time.

I did like Fiona's portrayal of Nicca.  She was probably the only character I truly invested in while watching.  I didn't even really connect to the little girl that much, not like I did Andy back in the day.  Even then, I was never a big fan of Child's Play 2.

I know alot of people rag on Bride or Seed of Chucky but I always liked them.  Sure, Seed probably got the cheesiest, but I still could make out the plot and I liked the amount of chucky dialogue and focus.  Plus, I liked the interaction of the chucky and tiffany dolls together.  Yes, I liked the more serious portrayal of the first one, but i was not against the shift to horror-comedy in the latter installments.  I still liked it and thought it worked for those movies.  Sequel after sequel with the same serious repetitive theme ... Chucky doll is remade once again, looks for Andy|new kid to transfer soul, while killing, would have become stale.  At least the addition of Tiffany and some of that humor added a new dimension for awhile.

With all that said, just because the style returned to a more serious portrayal again, does not mean it automatically deserves 4 and 5 stars in my opinion.  Granted, it's certainly not the worst made direct to dvd movie ever made, but when compared to it's predecessors, I would have to say it ranks pretty low.  Although, i might rank it a bit above Child's Play 2 because I was not crazy about the plot.  At least here, I held interest in the background connection with Chucky and this family, even if I felt it was under developed.",1381622400,3,3843,4.413940256045519
5855416,4,B00DTPRZ10,"Curse Of Chucky (2013), directed by Don Mancini. 95 minutes (unrated cut: 97 minutes)

Plot:

Proving that you just can't keep a Good Guy down, everyone's favorite homicidal maniac-trapped-inside-of-a-doll, Chucky (voiced by the indispensable Brad Dourif), has returned for more shenanigans in ""Curse Of Chucky."" This time he's landed in the lap of wheelchair-bound Nica (Fiona Dourif), herself hosting a houseful of grief-stricken family members. In an all-too-familiar fashion, members of her family start mysteriously dying in a variety of grisly ways, casting suspicion on the little red-headed chunk of plastic in the corner with a vacant stare and an inexplicable grin splashed across his face. As the clock winds down and the body count rises, Nica is in for a number of surprises, as are fans of the ""Child's Play"" franchise. Friends 'til the end indeed.

Writing and Directing:

In the wake of 2004's ultra-meta ""Seed Of Chucky,"" writer/director Don Mancini keeps the plot clean and clutter-free with ""Curse,"" letting the tension and bloodshed do most of the speaking. To that end, the film is more horror than comedy, calling back to the Tom Holland-helmed cult-classic that made us all so paranoid of Cabbage Patch Kids and their ilk 25 years ago (!). Mancini, who has written every single on of these films to date (and directed ""Seed""), has his finger firmly on the pulse of what his fanbase wants and delivers in spades. You want a more stripped-down flick where Chucky returns to his patented brand of sneaky slaughter? You got it. Do you want references and call-backs to film's past that will put a smile on your face? You get that too. Just make sure you watch the WHOLE feature. Franchise politics aside, Mancini does an excellent job of squeezing as much atmosphere out of his set-pieces as possible with a limited budget. The film looks and feels like a theatrical release, when it was clearly intended as a direct-to-video affair from the get-go.

Cast:

Fiona Dourif is a revelation as Nica. A regular chip off the old block, Fiona resembles her dad not only on the surface, but also in her ability to effortlessly pull off a complex character with limited means. Hopefully we will be seeing more of her in the future. The man himself, Brad Dourif, gets a significant amount of screen-time not as Chucky (who barely utters a line until half-way through the movie) but as Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler from way-back. We are treated to a great deal of flashbacks that wrap around nicely with the franchise's origins, and not only does Dourif still look the part, he gleefully embodies the role with all the necessary venom and vigor. The rest of the cast is serviceable if forgettable by comparison, barring a few 11th hour cameos that will have any fanboy (or girl) clamoring for more.

Music:

Joseph LoDuca's score works well for the most part, but can get a bit cumbersome in its final act. It's a far cry from the Graeme Revell and Pino Dinaggio works of yesteryear (or even the heavy metal assault of ""Bride Of Chucky""), but it gets the job done.

The Bottom Line(s):

""Curse Of Chucky"" is, in many ways, everything a fan could want from a sixth ""Child's Play"" flick. Mancini knows this franchise better than anyone else, so trust that you are in good hands. Relax, close your blinds and put your toys away. Chucky's back.

Lesson Learned:

Never accept large parcels with no return-address, lest you be supplied with a shotgun and plenty of ammunition.",1381622400,,3501,4.8655462184873945
5855417,4,B00DTPRZ10,the movie was overall alright staying to its roots but also creating a new story behind it with chucky not dying this time. a sequel may well be in the plans since the ending hints towards the end. though it is a movie that keeps you waiting for what he will do next. i enjoyed it but still nothing tops childs play 1 & 2,1381536000,,321,3.953846153846154
5855418,4,B00DTPRZ10,"I always liked the idea of the Child's Play films better than the execution. Chucky was a scary looking doll and a scary enough concept -- until the movies overexposed him, that is. Unfortunately, I feel they played their hand early in the series, even from the so-so first film. The rest devolved into hastily thrown together Z-grade horror movies that weren't worth a first look, let alone a second.

Still, with a longer amount of time passed and the promise of a reboot, I was willing to give this a chance. And boy, I'm glad I did!

The filmmakers wisely keep Chucky quiet for a good portion of the film. When he finally makes his presence fully known, the mayhem is more capably handled with just the right balance of humor, gore, and surprises. It's inspired storytelling for a series that seldom was. A worthy addition to this year's horror schedule. Make time for it. You won't be disappointed.",1381536000,,903,4.6375

one of the disk was missing and had no code for the D copy and it was not wrapped in plastic wrap as pretty much every single Factory made DVD normally has. My guess is someone made a mistake and didn't put the second disk in.... or two someone took it out before putting it in its delivery package since the package to me didn't really look like it was previously open.

5855422,4,B00DTPRZ10,"Halloween is right around the corner, and what better thing to do then t review the latest horror film hitting the silver screen. Wait? There aren't any new horror in theaters. What kind of Halloween season is this? Well be that as it may, I suppose the next best thing to do is see what hitting the shelves; and there just so happens be a particular horror name hitting dvd/blu-ray front.

This icon has not been seen since 2004, but the killer doll Chucky lives again in the direct-to-dvd film : Curse of Chucky. The studio behind the Child's Play franchise thought it would be best to reboot the series, but in the end, they decided to bring everyone's favorite killer doll to the small screen; but does this new film revitalized the 80's horror classic?

For those who are wondering, Curse of Chucky is a sequel to Seed of Chucky (don't worry, the film doesn't talk about that movie). Anyways, one day a mysterious package arrives at the door of the handicapped Nica and her mother Sara. When Sara is killed in the night, Nica's sister and her family arrive to handle Sara's affair. During their stay, Sara's daughter Alice befriends what was in the box, and that was a doll named Chucky; and where Chucky is, chaos is sure to follow.

Though this film is a direct-to-DVD, the story is a good continuation to Child's Play. My only gripe with the plot is how it is handled. The story itself is interesting, but the pacing is too quick. It felt like I was watching a short film found online. Yet, what the story lacks in pacing it makes up in intrigue. Curse of Chucky's story bring the series full circle; something I never expect to see in a movie like this.

For a horror film, Curse of Chucky was surprising in its characters and performances. Fiona Dourif certainly stole the show as Nica. Fiona played a different kind of horror protagonist, and I hope we see more of these characters in the future. The other show stealer was none other then Fiona's father, Brad Dourif, who reprises his role as Chucky. He may not have had a lot of lines; but hearing Brad as Chucky is nothing but nostalgic as the character has not lost his muster. While the rest of the cast was not as strong as the Dourifs, Curse of Chucky still has an impressive ensemble; or at least these characters had a purpose for being in this movie. It is step from what we see in so many horror films these days.

I've never been a fan of straight-to-dvd content (unless the film has DC Comics attached to it), but I have to say the quality of Curse of Chucky is worthy of the silver screen. While the cinematography is simple, it still effective capturing the horror that Child's Play was known for. Speaking of horror, while you can see most of the scares coming, there is an atmosphere to Curse of Chucky; which only helps the jump scares.

In horror film, we often looks at the scenes that frighten us. Yet in the case of this film, I think the best scene was the dinner sequence. This scene did not rely on scares, but suspense as Chucky put rat poison in the chili and you wondered who the lucky person going home dead.

While I'm not a major fan of direct-to-dvd films, I have to tip my hat to Curse of Chucky. Rather then feeling like the filmmakers were trying to get a quick buck, the movie felt like legitimate horror film worthy of the Chucky franchise. While there are some issues with the movie, Curse of Chucky is still a must see for any fan of the series.

5855431,4,B00DTPRZ10,"My review won't contain any spoilers.  All I have to say is that although this movie was excellent and a superb reintroduction of the series, the movie could be inducted in the HORROR HALL OF FAME if not hindered by the following:

--Chucky's doll-like appearance should've been kept throughout instead of making him look as if he took one full pulse rotation in a food processor.  The innocent/cute/evil matrix worked well with the overall realistic tone and sustains the eerie, creepiness level.

--unnecessary female/female action.

--appearance of character ""X"" as our little buddy's ""deus-ex machina"" figure during the police car scene completely KILLED it for me.  I mean, really?  Screenwriters could not have done better than resort to cheesy plot lifesavers?

--I don't appreciate flashbacks in novels nor do I appreciate them in movies.  You should be able to skillfully reveal everything as the story unfolds rather than divert my attention to a narratively weak flashback.

--The movie's second and fourth kill suffered from realistic inconsistencies.

--Marital argument scene was awkward and stilted.

--""Trapped in a house"" idea could've worked wonderfully, but, fell short.  Please study ""The Collector"" which executed this flawlessly.

PROS:

--good shock moments
--return to ruthless, though not ruthless enough, dark mood and tension
--camera angles awesome, especially some of the sequences with Chucky.  I don't think I've ever seen our Good Guy in some of those perspectives.  Adds a whole new way of relating to our boy.
--narrative of corrupt childhood and ""Good Guy's"" prevail also well appreciated.
--Superb, subtle moments of  highlighting the creepy doll qualities of Chucky.

Overall, the film had potential to be an EPIC remake able to hold  its own amongst the big boys.  For true fans of horror and the franchise, I would definitely purchase.  For others, this movie is a STEAL when it goes on sale.",1381363200,2,1931,5.241830065359477

5855435,3,B00DTPRZ10,"Many of the horror icons from the 1980s have returned to the big screen in recent years, though all have been reincarnations of the infamous monsters rather than a continuation. Jason returned with a steroid-affected physique, Freddy lost his humor and replaced it with stronger emphasis on pedophilia, and Leatherface became more sympathetic with several films giving us unnecessary back-story. The one villain from the 1980s to remain the same is Chucky, from casting to driving force and creator Don Mancini. The only thing that has changed over the years is the amount of damage done to his plastic face.

  Since Child's Play brought the ginger doll to life for the first time in 1988, creator Don Mancini has remained involved as screenwriter, and more recently as director. Mancini's career has consisted of little other than Chucky, with nearly all screenwriting credits belonging to the demonic doll. It wasn't until the last film, Seed of Chucky, that Mancini made his directorial debut. Curse of Chucky is his second film as a director, and though he still shows an inability to retrieve believable performances from any of his breathing actors, it is actually the screenwriting and a lack of Chucky's personality which drags this latest sequel into forgettable territory.

  The other remaining element from the franchise's origins is the voice of Chucky, Brad Dourif, though not in the same manner as fans of the franchise may be accustomed to. Gone are the wisecracking one-liners, instead replaced with a more silent Chucky and an emphasis on thrills and chills over laughter and camp. It almost feels like a throwback to the simplicity of the first film, though without the same amount of fun. Emphasis is on the deaths, which are very precisely carried out in terms of filmmaking, though too few and far apart to save the film. Curse of Chucky is a polished looking film, obviously created by some talented tradesmen, though lacking in any narrative creativity or engaging performances. In short, this is a bit too safe and predictable for a horror movie, even when it does deliver the gore.

  The plot is set up to take place entirely in one location, no doubt helping in lowering the cost of production and helping create the film's strong visuals from director of photography Michael Marshall. A package arrives as a gift to the home of Nica (Fiona Dourif), whose mother soon mysteriously dies. The package has a Chucky doll, which has a specific reason for visiting the particular house which makes the casting choice even more on-the-nose.

5855438,5,B00DTPRZ10,"One of the things that I loved about Ronny Yu's 1998 Bride of Chucky was that it took the Child's Play franchise in a completely new direction. After two sequels, creator Don Mancini wrote in Tiffany, the ""bride"" to the infamous slasher, Chucky, which turned the fourth film into a buddy comedy. Even through the gags, both Mancini and Yu kept a straight face, delivering one of the biggest shockers in horror history: a terrifying half doll-half human baby with razor sharp teeth. Mancini, who created the franchise, and penned all of the films, would take the reigns with the 2004 Seed of Chucky, which made a sharp turn that many weren't expecting. While I judge each film on its own merits (I really liked Seed of Chucky), it wasn't the movie that Bride of Chucky promised when it left us with our jaws on the theater floor.

Curse of Chucky, written and directed once again by Mancini, returns to the Child's Play roots, and finally delivers on that promise way back in 1998.

On the franchise's 25th anniversary, Chucky fans are in for a treat with the latest installment, which puts Brad Dourif's (the voice of Chucky) daughter Fiona in the lead role. She plays Nica, a born paraplegic, who is tossed in the middle of family drama when a ""Good Guys"" doll is delivered to her house. Neither her nor her mother knows who or why it was sent to them. Tossed in the trash, that night Nica is awakened to screams, only to find her mother dead on the floor from an apparent fall off the balcony. The Good Guys doll sits in the corner watching. Brooding. Waiting. Classic.

The next day, Nica's house is infiltrated with family, including her sister (Barb; Danielle Bisutti), brother-in-law (Ian; Brennan Elliott), their young daughter (Alice; Summer Howell) and a live-in maid (Jill; Maitland McConnell). The Good Guys doll immediately enamors Alice, making them best friends forever.

Chucky - for those of you unacquainted, is a serial killer named Charles Lee Ray that became trapped inside the doll (see Child's Play) - immediately begins his mischievous games, causing bizarre and unexpected deaths to occur. It all needs to look like an accident, which sort of ties Mancini's hands from being able to do much ""slashing""; it forces him to create suspense in other ways, for example, like putting rat poison in a random bowl of the guests' soup.

Curse of Chucky shows serious restraint, which is rare for a fifth sequel. Instead of jumping right in, Mancini works his way to the reveal, treating the film like an introduction to a completely new, younger audience. And even after ol' Chuckster is on a path of destruction, Mancini continued to peel layer, after layer, after layer off of the story, blasting the hardcore fans with more hat-tips than they'll be able to handle.

The new design of Chucky, which will make sense when you see the flick, is crazy scary. Complimented with astounding effects work and puppetry, Chucky has never looked better...

And even though budget appears to have no bearing on Chucky, you can definitely ""feel"" the constraints, especially since the near-entirety of the film is limited to a single location. Yet, Universal deserves serious props for getting creator Mancini back behind the camera because it was shot with extreme love and care, delivering on quality, classic camerawork and scares that feel intimate to a Child's Play film.

As a hardcore Child's Play fan, I find the flaws weren't so overpowering, although I do wish it were a bit gorier. And oddly enough, I really didn't like what Mancini did with Charles Lee Ray's backstory, which I felt turned him into a more mean-spirited serial killer.

Speaking of backstory, Mancini ties everything together in Curse of Chucky. It's a sincere love letter to the fans that really drop the gloves and goes for it. For some, the self-referential model may even be a little too much - but it without question carries the biggest geek-out moments since the 2003 Freddy vs. Jason.

Following the finale, the overly long epilogue plays out like something you'd see in Ocean's Eleven; and in terms of a payoff, it's what makes or breaks the movie. Audiences should stick through the end credits for what will be the ultimate sendoff if the franchise were to die tomorrow.

Curse of Chucky may just be the best home video sequel since Wrong Turn 2. It's alarmingly good, which puts pressure on Universal to answer as to why they didn't let Mancini shoot this for theaters. Chucky fans should rejoice, though, as Curse of Chucky is clearly going to re-ignite the franchise for years to come.",1381276800,5,4580,4.806861499364676
5855439,3,B00DTPRZ10,"After the off the rails hot mess that was ""Seed Of Chucky"", one wondered where in the world the series could go next. Thankfully, writer-director Don Mancini decided it had to go back to it's roots. Thank god. Thus, ""Curse Of Chucky"" is a return to form, and wipes away the bitter taste 'Seed' left in our mouths.

The movie follows Nica (Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad Dourif), a young woman confined to a wheelchair and living with her mother in a big, gothic house. A suspicious package arrives at the house carrying everyone's favorite sadistic doll. Where did it come from? Who sent it? Why them? After a tragedy, Nica's sister, brother in law, niece and a nanny come to the house, where strange things start happening and Chucky is back doing what he does best.

Going back to it's roots, ""Curse Of Chucky"" is a much darker and serious in tone film than it's two predecessors. Chucky himself is sadisitc and demented here, but he still gets to deliver some of his trademark perverse comical lines. Working with a limited budget, the movie is based mainly at one location, so director Mancini has to do his best to make the most of it and make it interesting to keep the viewer interested. There are some nice visuals, angles, and Mancini does some old school horror shots here to keep things alive. He has to, as Chucky doesn't even really get going until the 50 minute mark. There is a lot of build up and suspense. A lot of Chucky sitting there and disappearing and people wondering if what they saw out of the corner of their eye was real or not. It does a decent job of setting the mood and setting Chucky up to finally start delivering. We don't even hear Chucky talk until almost 45 minutes into the movie. There are times when the movie gets a little boring and isn't as exciting as other entries in the series, but the pros outweigh the cons. What are some of the cons? It's a little sluggish here and there, and some of the effects of Chucky were lacking. Chucky looks different here and it's not really for the good. I am not a fan of CGI in Chucky's face either, but it's here. There are moments where he looks like Chucky, and the next moment he doesn't. It's odd.

Cast-wise, Fiona Dourif is lovely and brings a more interesting and complex heroine to the genre. The supporting cast all do fine with their roles, but it still comes down to Brad Dourif. He also gets some screen time (which I won't go into, although other reviews on here spill everything) which is really cool, but he has not missed a step in voicing Chucky in the 9 years since the last film. That voice is Chucky, and it wouldn't be the same without him.

Other reviews here have spilled some of the surprises in the movie(and some without warning!), but I certainly won't if you haven't read any. What I will say is that Mancini ties in things to the past films. He hasn't forgotten any of them as there are references and visuals. The last 10-15 minutes are cool and a treat to long time fans. Also, you must stay AFTER the end credits for a few minutes of new stuff that includes a wonderful,long time coming cameo. It's not a high body count, but there is some blood and gore, although it's not excessive or in your face.

In the end, ""Curse Of Chucky"" wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be, but it was still a good, solid film that erases the lingering memory of 'Seed'. It's not the greatest film in the series, as I prefer the 1988 original, Part 2, and 'Bride' much more, but it's Chucky back being the Chucky we remember from the first film, and it has a number of references and treats for fans of the series. It's also a great looking film for a low budget, direct to DVD movie. It makes one hope that this is a new beginning for more adventures with this nasty little doll we were first introduced to 25 years ago.",1381276800,,3820,4.367088607594937
5855440,4,B00DTPRZ10,"I seriously thought this would be a really failed attempt at living up to the Chucky we all know and fear. But I was pleasantly suprised to find that even though Chucky has a new look, this movie actually went along with the original story about Charles Lee Ray and even prequeled (if you will) the original concept of the man who transferred his soul into this good guy doll. I enjoyed how Brad Dourif's real life daughter Fiona played the main character Nica. I knew when I first saw her face that it was Brad's daughter - love it! And the appearance by Tilly was awesome. Overall, if you love Chucky and / or enjoy watching his earlier movies, you will like how this one ties into them. Great job to the cast and crew!",1381276800,3,721,4.3088235294117645

Dourif's daughter played an awesome character, and the overall timeline of this movie in the series still bugs me, as I can't tell if it ignores certain aspects, or if they just threw it in for homage.

5855450,3,B00DTPRZ10,"Curse of Chucky was so close to finally putting the Child's Play series back on track.

Note: I am a fan of Child's Play 1-3, hated Bride and completely skipped Seed.

This entire movie I was excited, it was moody and full of tension. Could that be classified as slow? Perhaps, but it kept me and my wife on the edge of our seat. The movie is almost a perfect sequel to the original 3. ...Then it falls apart, right at the end.

SPOILERS BELOW:

The ending... The second Jennifer Tilly popped up worried me, but I could have lived with it, the acting wasn't terrible and could have still fit into an ignoring Bride and Seed mindset.
The real issue is the final before credits scene. Chucky being sent to the girl and apparently transferring(or attempting to) his soul into her.

The issues being:

1: He couldn't, as was established in the first 3, move his soul into the girl because he'd become flesh. (As someone who doesn't remember/know what was established in Bride and Seed perhaps this and him  not being a flesh and blood doll is explained away in the canon of those films. If so feel free to leave a comment below explaining it because it would remove one of my issues with this ending and raise my opinion of this movie a bit.)

2: It makes the after credits sequence completely nonsensical... Did the grandmother stop Chucky mid transfer? Perhaps... If so the after the credits scene would at least make more sense but it makes the ending as a whole confusing as hell and this scene completely superfluous. I'm sure they put this scene in as a ""Hey, we didn't forget the girl"" sort of hand wave, but it tries to close a door that would have been better left open.

3: It's just a bad ending. It makes the movie unnecessarily longer and (especially if it was stopped by the grandmother) adds nothing interesting. Unlike the after credits scene if it had been the ending instead.

The movie should have either went directly to the end credits after Tilly mails the package and cut to the scene of Andy after the credits or used that scene in place of the scene with the little girl.

SPOILERS END

Overall I enjoyed the movie, it's still pretty good and I could still see myself watching it again someday, unlike Bride. I just wish the ending (and some details involving canon in general) was better thought out instead of being confusing, longwinded and yet feeling rushed at the same time.",1381190400,,2401,4.506912442396313
5855451,5,B00DTPRZ10,"What could possibly be expected from a part six of a franchise that has just gone direct to video? I was in store for a generic body count film featuring a group of people locked in a house with Chucky. I was not expecting any kind of explanations or direct ties with the franchise other then a brief retelling of Charles Lee Ray getting gunned down by the police and passing his soul inside of a doll at MOST.

I have never been so happy to be so wrong! This film features dark scenes with POV shots that are as frightening as in the original two films. Then the doll's look along with the entire franchise is very creatively explained. The plot is written so well and really connects the entire franchise together.

The pacing of this film was seamless. It did not even feel like it was 90 + minutes. The suspense was absolutely edge of your seat. This film did a great job at reminding audiences as to why Chucky is and always was a HORROR character to begin with.",1381190400,33,967,4.3076923076923075

It was straight up a horror movie & that what I was looking for in this movie, I do admit I was a little hesitant about buying this movie.

In case you forgot the Chucky story, he rehashes it. This is a straight forward Chucky film which includes blood squirts, puns, and of course a doll with a knife.

5855460,4,B00DTPRZ10,"It's been almost a decade, but Chucky's back! Universal Home Entertainment gives fright fans ""Curse of Chucky"" just in time for Halloween. There's no doubt that decades down the road, the image of the deranged Good Guys doll will be immortalized right next to the Universal Classic Monsters like Frankenstein's creation, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Right or wrong, the ""Child's Play"" movies and their sequels have made that big of an impact on pop culture.

Wheelchair-bound Nica and her mother live alone in a secluded mansion. When a mysterious package holding a vintage Good Guys doll named Chucky is delivered to their doorstep, they think it's just a mistake. After being tossed in the trash, Chucky is found sitting near the bloody corpse of Nica's mother. As the house fills up with guests for the funeral, the body count rises. The malevolent soul inside Chucky needs a body to inhabit, and Nica's niece meets his deranged requirements.

Director/Writer Don Mancini brings the ""Child's Play"" movies full circle with ""Curse of Chucky."" After two entries in the series many would call more camp and humor than horror, he re-injects this entry with a healthy dose of suspense and thrills. His choice of an old dark mansion also helps by giving the film a classic gothic atmosphere. I would say this is the perfect balance between the original and its lighter-hearted sequels.

The special effects team is hard at work in ""Curse of Chucky."" This is not the sanitized PG-13 or R-rated slasher films we saw in the late 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. It's graphic and the gore is here for everyone to enjoy. Whether running, smiling, turning his head around, or slashing away at someone, Chucky looks fabulous.

Brad Dourif is every bit as humorous as we've come to expect when he voices Chucky. You can't help but giggle every time you hear the childhood toy utter foul language and say inappropriate things. He really is perfect in the role.

""Curse of Chucky"" is full of skepticism towards religion and Christianity. Chucky tells the little girl he terrorizes that there is no God several times. Nica and her mother both left the church after an obvious period of disillusionment. The priest also seems rather judgmental and Nica's sister presents herself as a Christian but definitely doesn't live that way. You can take all this as an attack against Christianity or as a general example of how Director/Writer Mancini sees hypocritical ""followers"" of the faith.

The Unrated version of ""Curse of Chucky"" didn't strike me as any worse than what would be considered an R-rated movie these days. There's plenty of graphic violence, foul language, and sexual situations. However, there's no nudity to be found.

""Curse of Chucky"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1) and 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Every gory slash, cackle from Chucky, and rumbling roll of thunder will resonate throughout your home theater. The picture quality is clear and easy on the eyes as well.

There are some interesting special features included on the Blu-ray edition of ""Curse of Chucky."" Audio commentary is provided by Director Don Mancini, Puppeteer Tony Gardner, and actor Fiona Dourif. It contains three featurettes entitled """"Playing with Dolls: The Making of 'Curse of Chucky,'"" ""Living Doll: Bringing Chucky to Life,'"" and ""Voodoo Doll: The Chucky Legacy.'"" Storyboard comparisons, deleted scenes, and a gag reel round out the bonus material.

I'm actually quite surprised that ""Curse of Chucky"" didn't get a theatrical release. I know it boils down to Universal wanting to test the waters for their upcoming reboot of the franchise without investing too much in promotion. The film really does a great job revitalizing the series and reminding genre fans why they fell in love with the maniacal character in the first place.",1380758400,,3872,5.0375

- There's nothing special about the special effects. For example, for the first 60 minutes, there's only one good effect relating to the Catholic father. All the others look childish. This movie has a shoestring budget and it shows.

- The acting is below average. It's not convincing.

- There's no horror and suspense. Everything is predictable and bland.  If you have seen 10 or more horror movies, you have seen it all.

- For the first 20 minutes, they tried to make the plot a little deeper than others of the same genre. However, after that, it's same old stuff again.

After watching it, I knew why the producer did not have it shown at the theaters. They knew they wouldn't make any money there.

For years there had been talk of a remake and when I found out it had been scrapped in favour of another sequel, directed by the creator of the franchise I was over the moon.  Unfortunately this movie sucks.  There is no reason for it to be marketed as the ""unrated"" version because the film is so lame it required no censoring.  The actors all do a pretty good job, especially the lead actress.  The film is well shot, well lit and well directed.  The problem is that the story sucks.  It's boring, nothing happens for the first 45 minutes.  As for the final act, it's all watered down flash backs. Now I have a lot of respect for the makers of this film but the end product wouldn't scare a 12 year old girl. As far as I can tell, director Don Mancini rushed this film in order to squash the horrible remake idea which I am thankful for but there are only about 5 characters in the whole film and you don't even get to see Chucky move until the last 20 minutes.  Even academy award winner Brad Dourif sucks in this film.  His character of Charles Lee Ray was always a self centred maniac but in this film he comes across as a Norman Bates type obsessive weirdo.  In closing let me just say that I'm glad they made a sequel instead of a remake.  Horror films have bounced back from countless crappy sequels in the past where a dud remake would have left the franchise with nowhere to go (just look at poor Freddy Krueger) but as far as sequels go this will go down in history alongside Halloween 5 as a shameful waste of time.  On the bright side this film mentions Andy Barclay (Chucky's original nemesis) several times and touches on Chucky's completion anxiety for never killing him.

5855471,2,B00DTPRZ10,"""Hi, I'm Chucky wanna play?"" Nica (Dourif) is a young woman confined to a wheelchair and living with her mother. One day a package shows up and they are surprised to see a doll inside. After Nica's mother is found dead the rest of her family shows up and little by little others are found dead. Nica has her suspicions about the little doll but no one believes her. I have to admit that I do like the Child's Play series. The original is cheesy and fun to watch. Little by little they got more and more cheesy ultimately leading to Jennifer Tilly making fun of herself. What they did realize though is the cheesier they got the more humor they added in to make it more fun to watch. That said I was looking forward to seeing this one. Since it seems like all 80's movies are getting sequels this one was next on the list. Hopefully the fact that this is straight to video will convince them to stop. While this isn't terrible this installment is just very slow movie and boring. They went more serious with this one and I think that may have hurt the enjoyment of it. It could have been just my expectations of this but I found it really hard to get into. In order to get most of the little flashbacks and some plot points in this you do have to see all the others first. On the other hand re-watching all the others will show you just how bad this one is. Overall, disappointing, very disappointing. I give it a C+.",1380240000,,1416,4.2481481481481485

The whole time I was wondering where this movie was taking place, after the 3rd, 4th, 5th.  I kept wondering the whole time, SPOILER-ish  it does take place after seed of chucky.  This was such a fantastic film, made me jump a few times, which hasn't happened lately at all during a horror/thriller/suspense type movie.  I'm still not sure how much I like CGI (at times) Chucky, but it was a great direct to video movie, you get a little more back story on Charles lee ray also.  Check it out if you are a fan of the series.  It does have a few goofy moments, but whats a chucky movie without them, as long as they are kept in line.",1380240000,,776,4.303448275862069

Hopefully this is not the last we see of  Chucky and how this one goes off (Multiple endings) I wouldn't be suprised if they was a Chucky 7!! Which I hope there is!

5855475,3,B00DTPRZ10,"As an avid horror fan, the Child's Play series is an unavoidable and undeniable favorite of the genre. And while I am a fan of the franchise overall, I can't accept the last two entries in the series, especially ""Seed of Chucky"", as nothing more than utter trash. So when I heard they were making another ""Chucky"" film, I could only hope and pray it wouldn't be anything like the last two. Don Mancini returns as writer/director, which by now, I didn't know if that was a good thing or not. Fortunately, ""Curse of Chucky"" goes back to the style of the first 3 films. A straight forward scary movie, with the humor only coming from the wise-cracking and foul mouthed Chucky! I won't bother writing out the plot and explaining characters or anything like that, but its a decent and pretty well written storyline. I do think it kinda gets off to a slow start, but it does pick up and get better as it goes along. And as it goes along, it does a good job of tying the other films together. However, I'm not completely sure where this film falls into the franchise's timeline. As far as the acting, its ok. Nothing too amazing. One reason for that could be that the characters are pretty forgettable overall. Though I do think that Fiona Dourif (yes, it is Brad Dourif's daughter) as the main protagonist Nica, has a real good performance. And of course Brad Dourif is great as always as the voice of Chucky. But due to the film's beginning slow pace, you don't get to hear a lot of him until the last act of the film. And I don't want to spoil anything, but there are also couple a surprises in the film. And be sure to stay tuned after the credits have rolled too! To be a direct to DVD film and having a budget of only 5 million (according to IMDB), the film does look pretty good. As far as the special effects, they were ok. Certain things didn't look that great and I just didn't there was enough blood. There are a couple of decent deaths, but most of them are too simplistic. But perhaps that had to do with budgetary reasons. As far as the animatronics go, they are decent. The close up shots are pretty good, but in shots that show the whole doll moving/walking, it doesn't always look so good. I'm not sure how much of that animation is pure mechanical or if some CGI was used as well. And again, I'm sure the budget limited this to a degree. And for those of you that were like me and thought they were way off on the look of Chucky when he comes to life, because I didn't like the look at all, it is explained during the movie, so be patient!! Overall, this is a good film. It breathes new life into a franchise that has really suffered for years. Too bad that Don Mancini didn't think of doing this one a decade or so earlier. And its too bad he didn't get a bigger budget for this one and a theatrical release, which would have been great. However, I think this film will do well and draw enough interest for future sequels with hopefully more resources to work with.",1380153600,4,2977,4.298932384341637
5855476,5,B00DTPRZ10,"Movies around today aren't like the classics. Many producers are ruining horror classics with remakes and other b.s. Curse of Chucky is my favorite horror movie around today. I loved all the movies prior to Curse-so this one was a must see for me. I loved how everything tied together and I also loved the guest appearances- I will only mention Miss Jennifer Tilly! I must warn you, make sure to watch after the credits for another surprise you'll love as much as I did. I just kind of wish Catherine Hicks made a short appearance.
Either way, the movie was just great. I don't want to spoil the movie in this review, I just want to make sure you all see it! If you love Chucky, you'll love this!

Now I have to make the hard decision.... to buy this copy or this boxset:

5855477,4,B00DTPRZ10,"What follows is a brief, spoiler free review. If you love Chucky as much as I think you might, don't like ANYONE give away the twists in the final act.

If ever there was a fan boy horror movie on Chucky, ""Curse of Chucky"" would be it. With references to all of the previous entries in the franchise, this film is a delight from beginning to end. As ""Curse of Chucky"" begins, we meet the lonely Nica (played by Fiona Dourif in a wonderfully understated performance) as she is living with her mom in house in the middle of nowhere. Her mother wants to keep her sheltered from the rest of the world as Nica is confined to a wheelchair. One day, the two receive an anonymous package in the mail with a doll inside. The doll is Chucky and he is ready to play. When an unfortunate ""accident"" causes her mother's death, Nica's greedy relatives are back to claim the house and sell it to make a few extra bucks.

After the rest of Nica's family arrives including her bitchy older sister Barb (nicely played by Danielle Bisutti) with her daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell), it is up to the family to survive the night to keep from becoming Chucky's latest victims. And victims many do become with a bloodbath that results in a few grisly deaths that had me smiling.

Though the film starts with a slow buildup in the first act that results in two off screen deaths (don't worry, like I said, the film does get bloody), the film nicely comes together in its second act to become one of the best made for video horror movies of recent years. To go on and tell you what REALLY works about this film would be to give away way too many of the devilish surprises. Let's just say that fans will cheer in delight as the film hits its final act as there are in jokes, references, and homages to just about anything and everything Chucky has done in the past. The backstory might not be fulfilling to some and there might be some leaps in logic, but this is the rare horror sequel that actually appears to be trying to add something new while being faithful to what came before it. If you are a Chucky fan, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. Also, make sure to stay after the end credits for one treat of a scene that will leave audiences howling. Thanks for returning Chucky, you were missed. Now, let's see some more Chuck!",1380067200,25,2317,4.3341013824884795
5855478,4,B00DTPRZ10,"This review will contain spoilers! Ever since I was six years old, I've loved the Chucky series. I had high expectations for Chucky's 6th film, but I was pretty letdown. After watching it a 2nd time, it was a little bit better. The first half of the movie is very slow moving it doesn't even feel like a Chucky movie. It felt like a spooky soap opera and Chucky was just sitting in the background, letting you remember that it's supposed to be his movie. It definitely goes back to the darker tone of the Child's Play series, but it just doesn't have the same spirit. The last half is where this movie actually starts to pick up and become interesting. There is a great flashback scene that gave me chills that explains why Chucky is attacking this family and how it leads to the opening of the original film, which I thought was EPIC! The after-credits scene was just as awesome as it finally gives us the return of Andy Barclay!

When her mother supposedly kills herself, paraplegic Nica deals with her loss and the rest of her dysfunctional family. A Good-Guy doll by the name of Chucky shows up and befriends Barbara's daughter, Alice. Soon, grisly murders begin to happen and Nica links the doll to all the past murders and must fight Chucky before he gets his long-awaited revenge.

The puppet effects were a little off sometimes, and the computer-generated Chucky (in the scene where he walks down the stairs from the attic) was a little bad. Overall, the movie had a nice, slow build that had me uneasy, which is something I haven't been able to say about Chucky for a while. I also enjoyed the surprise cameos. I'm a little confused as to where this film falls in the series, timeline-wise, but that may be more my fault than the movie's. Also, the ending was creepy. :-)",1379980800,14,588,4.5046728971962615

This is definitely back to Chucky's horror roots and the stuff you see in this film will have you feeling an even greater uneasiness and terror than any one of the films before it.

8597592,5,B00DTPRZ10,"The sixth entry in the Child's Play series, Curse Of Chucky is a definate high point in the francise, scarier than most and succeeding at making Chucky a more credible, more serious threat.  His principal nemesis this time is a wheelchair-bound girl named Nica (well-played by Fiona Dorif, real-life daughter of Brad Dourif, who's voiced Chucky in all the films including this one).  Nica lives with her mentally unwell mother Sarah (Chantall Quesnelle) in an isolated mansion.  One day the two receive a package by delivery, containing a Good Guys doll.  The two vaguely remember the doll as having been from a toy line that was wildly successful in the 80s, but don't seem to remember the Chucky story that was in the news in the 80s and early 90s.  For Nica, the doll is quickly forgotten the next morning when she discovers her mother dead of an apparant suicide.

Her family arrives at the scene the next day, and among them is Nica's young niece Alice (Summer Howell), who quickly becomes a target in Chucky's sights.  Most of the movie plays out over one day and night at the mansion, and it succeeds with a classic horror atmospheric feel that is quite different from the over-the-top, somewhat comedic tone used in many of the series's other chapters (a tone that has at times been successful in its own right).  The filmmakers have got Chucky in a situation where his menace feels genuine, because rather than playing him as being as inherently as dangerous as other slasher icons like Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, they've got him menacing because of specific circumstances.  We're back to the first movie in a way, where he's dangerous because no one feels threatened by a doll.  He's dangerous when the only one who believes he's real is a small child.  He's dangerous because he's smart and sneaky, knowing he can't just barge into a room and slaughter everyone straight out.  And he's dangerous this time because his main enemy is at the disadvantage of being both confined to a wheelchair and not being taken very seriously by most of the other occupants of the mansion.  The 'main protagonist' role is split between Nica and Alice, with both doing very well in different ways.

This might just be my favorite in the Chucky line, and incidentally it doesn't necessarily require the viewer to have seen all five previous movies, though it's better that way.  As either a standalone movie or a part of the longer series, this is a winner, and filled with some nice surprises throughout (make sure you watch to the end of the closing credits).
