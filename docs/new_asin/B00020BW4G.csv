2050619,5,B00020BW4G,"There are few documentaries that can truly take your breath away and ""Touching The Void"" is a masterpiece.  The true story of British mountain climbers of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates balances story telling, suspense and brilliant photography without falling down.  Their decision to be the first climbers of Peru's Siula Grande via an arguably unapproachable ascent blends bravery and madness.  What got these arrogant climbers into trouble?  What happened on that mountain when both `knew' they would die?  How could either of them survive?  Most intriguing is how could a man locked in a deep lightless crevasse with a severely broken leg get miles down the mountain and glacier?  It's all told with interviews with both climbers spliced in between truly remarkable cinematography.  The panoramic views and the treachery of the mountains weather are captured like no other film has done before.  It is a nail-biter.
The extras are wonderful as well.  How this film was made is another exercise in major accomplishments and ""Return to Siula Grande"" is startling when trying to understand these two men's emotions after such an ordeal.  They both were tested on their personal beliefs in God and mortality.  Their conclusions will surprise you.  It was clearly the event of their lives.  Recorded in Dolby 5.1, the sound adds a level of realism unlike most films.",1088035200,8,1363,5.081081081081081
2050620,4,B00020BW4G,"I was not prepared for the heart-stopping, intensity of TOUCHING THE VOID (MGM).
This documentary-like reconstruction of a harrowing 1985 true-climbing incident on the previously unconquered Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes by British climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates (who also narrate) is ideal for the armchair adventurer dad.
The photography is stupendous, but the astounding story of courage and the staggering will to survive is unforgettable.",1088035200,2,454,5.6911764705882355
2050621,5,B00020BW4G,"Have you ever watched a film and afterwards somebody asks you, ""Was it any good?""  I had a co-worker ask me that very question after I saw this film in the theater.  I just nodded.  He laughed, ""It's so good that words escape you?""  I nodded again.  This film is easily, without a doubt, with no competition whatsoever, the best film released this year.  Bar none.  The film itself is a true-life survival story, visceral and incredible, with fine acting from the two climber/actors that were cast for the two leads and some breathtaking cinematography.  I actually pity anyone who did not see this film in the theater.  However, those with huge television sets are in for an amazing experience.  What makes this docu-drama stand head and shoulders over most documentaries and/or docu-dramas are the absolutely honest interviews with those involved in the incident.  There were two climbers and another man left behind to watch their base-camp.  All three men convey very truthful, often ""brutally"" truthful accounts of the event.  When I first heard about this film and that both climbers survive I thought, ""How intense could it really be knowing that?""  I am not ruining anything by saying they survive because within the first few scenes of this film it is shown through interviews with the actual climbers.  By no means does this diminish the film or the story in any way.  I have this personal habit of writing down, throughout the year, all the 5-star films that I have seen in the theater.  The film's title sits all alone at the top of the page.  I seriously doubt I will see a better film this year.  Perhaps one nearly its equal, but by no means, better.  I highly recommend buying this fantastic film.  Thank you.",1087862400,3,1725,4.7407407407407405
2050622,5,B00020BW4G,"For far too often, Hollywood has announced a film 'Based on a True Story' only to go on to so twist and add to the true-life story that the film becomes a lie.
Not here.
This is absolutely true - the story of one of the most incredible mountaineering accidents that has ever taken place.
Filmed as both a re-enactment and as a documentary - with the three main characters recounting the tale in their own words - was a stroke of genius.
How can I review it before it's released? Here in the UK, this DVD has been out for a few months - everyone we've played it to has sat wide-eyed in amazement at a most unusually constructed but totally true-to-life film.",1086307200,3,657,4.306451612903226
2050623,5,B00020BW4G,"The movie was absolutely breathtaking, and reading the book gives you their harrowing journey in more incredible detail, including thoughts from Simon. I highly recommend both the book and the movie as invaluable companions to each other!!",1086220800,,239,5.486486486486487
2050624,5,B00020BW4G,one of those movies that leaves you speechless.  just see it.,1085875200,,61,4.545454545454546
2050625,5,B00020BW4G,"My son and I came out of the theater exhausted just by watching this quasi-documentary reenactment of the 1985 ascent up an unclimbed route on the Siula Grande glacier in Peru.  The film's impact is heightened by the excellent cutting between the actor/climbers and Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, who recall their actions, reactions, and feelings nearly 20 years later.  Disaster strikes on the descent, where -- as one of them notes -- ""80 percent of accidents happen.""  After Simpson breaks his leg in a fall, Yates -- against impossible odds -- continues to try and get him down.  Finally, Simpson falls again, off the edge of the mountain.  After hours of hanging on to what feels like dead weight, Yates cuts the rope to prevent himself from being gradually pulled into the void.  Simpson's survival and return to base camp is nothing short of miraculous, suggesting that man is never more tenacious about life than when he is closest to losing it.  Though far different in its circumstances, his story rivals that of Shackleton and the Endurance in Antartica three quarters of a century before.  An underlying issue, addressed briefly in the film, is whether Yates should have cut the rope.  Apparently some other climbers criticized him for doing so, but Simpson always defended his action.  I have no idea how well the technical aspects of Touching the Void are done, but to this mostly earthboard amateur, they looked brilliantly and truly shot.  Danger and beauty are scarcely separable in Touching the Void.  When you are not immersed in the terror of Yates' and, especially, Simpson's plight, the frigid beauty of the glacier, the colors within its crevasses are glorious.  A story of recklessness and great determination, superbly told, filled with many ""how did they ever shoot that?"" moments, Touching the Void must be seen.",1085529600,101,1837,4.9640522875816995
2050626,4,B00020BW4G,"I read the book (see my review of the book) a few months before the movie came to a theater near me, I then went to see it.  Seeing the actual terrain in which the story took place made it even more spectacular and amazing.  In one scene Joe (the real Joe did this scene) is filmed from far off zigzagging his way along the glacier by sitting backwards and pushing himself with his good leg, that scene alone made me realize just how big this mountain is and how hard it was for Joe to get down.  Read the book first, it is a very quick read and it is well worth it, then see the film, I promise you will not be disappointed.",1085356800,,625,3.984
2050627,4,B00020BW4G,"Touching the Void is one of those movies that is so much more than just 'about' what it shows. In harrowing narration and re-enactments, the movie documents a climb that two English men took up a Peruvian peak...only to have one of the men, Joe Simpson, break his leg and strand them 20,000 feet above the ground. Joe's climbing partner, Simon Yates, makes the logical/moral decision to cut the rope and let Joe loose, saving himself in the process. And then for the next hour, Joe recounts his excruciating journey to safety while the movie stunningly re-enacts every suspenseful minute. Void makes such an impression because it reaches down to that deepest of fears that we all have, and that Joe had to confront face-to-face - the glaring probability of imminent, lonely death. Though for the most of the movie, I was enraptured in this tale of survival, I felt engrossed in my thoughts about how I would function in such a situation, and wonder where I would have given up...if I would have. The movie brings vitality to the carnal desire to survive despite all obstacles, and even manages to show something of the relationship between friends Joe and Simon...one that wasn't even strained upon Simon's decision to cut the rope. Void is also a technical marvel: Alex Heffes' score is one of the best I've heard this year, and Mike Eley and Keith Partridges' cinematography turns the barren Andes into a haunting death trap. The movie only stumbles during its inevitably long third act, in which Joe gets closer and closer to safety...I know that the dude was bored, but that doesn't mean we need to be watching it. But I digress - the movie has enough thought-provoking, eye-feasting moments to make it well worth the while. Bring Depends if you're afraid of heights. GRADE: B+",1084665600,3,1781,4.785714285714286

I really wanted to see if the video could accurately capture the essence of the book. It did a pretty good job. I still recommend reading the book though as not all of the details could possibly be included in a 100-minute or so video. Only issue I have with streaming videos is that the voice and visual are usually out of sync. It could be my internet connection which is Verizon Jetpack 4G (in reality sometimes only get 3G). I am watching it on a 64GB iPad. Would I recommend this video?  Yes, absolutely!

2050861,5,B00020BW4G,"This is one of my two favorite survivor docudramas (the other is ""The Endurance: Shackeltons Legendary Antarctic Expedition"" with Liam Neeson). These films show that we are capable of surviving when that appears to be impossible. ""Touching the Void,"" like ""Endurance,"" shows survival when one in desperate circumstances knows that there will be no help from others. A mountain climber must cut the rope to save himself. The climber on the other end of that rope has a badly broken leg. He's as good as dead -- but he lives. A remarkable thing about this film is that it brings the climbers together to discuss the experience, and the climber who was cut loose (Joe Simpson) is totally understanding and sympathetic with the the climber who cut him loose (Simon Yates).",1393891200,4,768,4.870229007633588

Don't get me wrong I'm sure this went through his mind many times but constantly mentioning it is annoying. The statement completely loses its effect. Its like describing an experience in the desert and saying ""It was so hoooot"" about 100 times  Your in a life threatening situation, its obvious, the thought of death is all around you, its the norm, stop mentioning it.

I'm in awe of the filmmaking, which re-enacts the two young British climbers' perilous climb and near-tragic descent on Siula Grande mountain.

Because of the cold and the ultimate triumph the human spirit, this movie is in my family's Christmas rotation -- just like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and LOVE ACTUALLY.

I knew something was going to happen, but when, what, and to whom exactly -- i didn't know.  I was absolutely shocked when Simon cut the rope! I mean, just stunned! It not occurring to him to check somehow the crevasse before leaving, even calling out from the top, geez SOMETHING, anything! Then the story bit about minimizing the negative on his role in, what he thought was, Joe's ""death"" on his way back to camp?!  Not to mention, eventually BURNING his clothes??!  Are you kidding me?! Wow. Just...Wow.

As i watched this movie, words like, ""Coward"" and ""Friendship -- or lack thereof"" came to mind.  Although i was extremely happy for and proud of Joe for what he was able to accomplish, the movie also, just royally pissed me off.  I will say this about Simon too though, staying around and lingering at camp was probably thee best thing he did for Joe.

Everyone has their own opinions on things and they have a right to, so go ahead and watch this movie, but now you know that it just MIGHT piss you off too. lol",1387497600,,1109,4.428571428571429

Its an agonizing yet moving experience to see what human beings are capable of in the quest for survival. It shows the boundries that are crossed that few have ever gone through in order to survive. In this true story, told by the very people who experienced it, we learn that the human spirit can endure much suffering and torment in order to keep on living. When the body is at the point of total dehydration, severe debilitating horrible pain, horriblbe frostbite and total emotional and physical fatigue, the will to fight onward in order to live can become nearly impossible yet this film shows us all that anything is possible if we believe it can happen. And indeed it does. There is a point when the human spirit is totally torn apart and beaten, yet the fight for survival is so intense that some how you know you must move on and keep fighting to stay alive. This intense film about two mountain climbers who nearly parished on the slopes of a mountain so brutal and unforgiving it is impossible to imagine, is powerful, terrifying, emotional and incredibly inspiring. This is truly the greatest mountain climbing story ever made, and all the more sobering because its all true. This is a masterful achievement in film making that will take your breath away, and surely one you are not soon to forget.",1367625600,,1389,4.627530364372469

As harrowing as many of those TV shows are, they are bound within a short frame of time; not long enough in most cases for the viewer/witness to slip deeply into the dreadful circumstance. ""Touching the Void"" succeeds in this. I was familiar with the story; already knew about Simon having to cut the rope -- and he did -- HAVE TO cut the rope.

The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. The heart-pounding climbing sequences place the viewer in the boots of the two climbers, and the story is a face-paced, gut-retching, roller coaster from beginning to end.

2051241,4,B00020BW4G,"In 1985, English climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, attempted to scale Siula Gande, a peak in the Peruvian Andes.  The climb, which began as a bold venture achieving some success, turned into a life threatening adventure, that put both men through harrowing physical and emotional trials.  Simpson wrote a book about the adventure called Touching the Void, which director Kevin MacDonald used as the basis for his 2003 documentary style film of the same name.

Serving as technical advisors and narrators for the project, Simpson and Yates returned to Peru for the first time since the incident happened, some 17 years previous.  Professional actors were used to portray the climbers in reenactments of the events.  Simpson and Yates also appear in the film, recounting their thoughts and memories, and also providing narration while the reenactments play.  Switching between the real climbers, and the actors, is a bit disconcerting at times, and makes the storytelling a bit uneven.  Things are sometimes hard to follow, when what the men describe, doesn't quite match what appears in the movie.  They are often bundled up and wearing goggles, but neither Brendan MacKey who plays Joe Simpson, or Nicholas Aaron who plays Simon Yates, closely resembles the men they are playing.

Taking a blitz type approach, the climbers successfully reach the summit, but on the descent, when 80% of mishaps occur, they unfortunately they run into trouble, as Simpson severely fractured one of his legs.  Yates attempted to get his partner down the mountain, lowering him by rope in stages.  This method worked for a while, until Simpson slid over the edge of the snow covered slope, and was suspended helpless in the air with the unknown below.  Above him, but unaware of what had happened, Yates was left bearing the weight of his partner.  It was only a matter of time before Yates' strength would give out, and both men would tumble down the slope, so Yates cut the rope, and Simpson dropped into the unknown.

Among the mountain climbing community, Yates action was controversial, as some considered it a selfish act.  Fortunately, Simpson had fallen into a cavern, and landed on a ledge, however Yates saw no signs of him, and assumed that he was dead.  Yates eventually made his way down the mountain, and back to his basecamp where groundsman Richard Hawkins was waiting.  How Joe Simpson made it down the mountain with just one good leg, and no food and little water, is what makes this a remarkable tale of determination and survival.  The focus intensifies during Simpson's solitary journey, and the film seems to flow a little more smoothly.

The bonus materials reveal that the experience of making the film was in some ways, traumatic for the two climbers.  Reliving the adventure, dredged up forgotten memories, which was not always a positive experience, and both Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, became disillusioned with the project to some degree.  The conditions and weather on location were also a challenge for MacDonald and his film crew.  Fortunately these problems were overcome, enabling the film to be completed.

How to bringing Simpson's and Yate's compelling tale of perseverance and survival to the screen, was a question that director MacDonald struggled with.  Featuring impressive and occasionally breathtaking cinematography, the format that MacDonald went with, tells the story pretty well, and with a sense of drama, although how realistic the film may be, is unclear.  Featuring the testimonials of Yates, Simpson, and Hawkins, provides ties to reality, and helps to anchor the film.

2051268,5,B00020BW4G,"This documentary-style film has been reviewed by over 100 people, so I'm not going to add much by recounting the plot.  Briefly, experienced climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates climbed Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes in 1985, and got into trouble on the way down.  Mr. Yates made the controversial decision to cut the climbing rope he was using to help ferry Mr. Simpson down the mountain, after Mr. Simpson became seriously injured.

Suffice it to say, I (like most viewers, I'd suspect) used the gift of hindsight to evaluate the decisions made by the two climbers.

I suppose the first mistake made was shared by both; they traveled so light they forgot a support crew.  True, they did have the 'help' of a man (Richard Hawking) they met on the way to their mountain (who was not a climber), but they essentially went it alone.  They summited, but got into real trouble on the way down.

The film is very well done, going to the actual mountain where the events took place (though much was filmed in the European Alps).  It details both men's experiences, and begs the question, 'what would you do?'  I don't think the answer is a simple as some believe.

A harrowing and gripping film.  The scenery, as one could imagine, is stunning.  Draw your own conclusions as to which decisions were the right ones, and which weren't.

Even if you are not at all interested in climbing, this is simply one of the most riveting stories ever told and one of my favorite movies ever.  The story itself is absolutely awe-inspiring, almost too fantastic to fathom. An unbelievable journey into what a human being can endure, and still survive.  This alone would be compelling enough to make this a ""must see"", but it is the WAY the story is told that makes the movie unforgettable.  Part documentary, part re-creation scenes and part movie, make this DVD absolutely unique.  Incredibly beautiful cinematography and excellent re-enactments (not the usual cheesy stuff you are used to seeing) combine with technical climbing accuracy and the drama of the unfolding story.

What really sets this movie apart, are the interviews with Joe, Simon and Richard.  I was absolutely taken aback by the honesty they exhibited in telling their stories (as when Richard reflects on who he would prefer to survive).  This type of honesty and insight is exactly what is missing from most true story movies.

2051275,5,B00020BW4G,"First of all, this is one of those rare productions where some 'Hollywood' version of true events [** you know, the old Hollywood classic of ""for the sake of the script, viewer interest and so-termed 'creative license' ...] doesn't tinker with the facts or where countless Hollywood hawked ""taken from true events"" winds up taking a beating and pure 'fiction' enters the script forthwith! See my K2 review and the additional problem of some folks seeing a 'movie' and suddenly transpose the movie and sometimes even its 'fictional' characters and conjured plot to literal 'fact' [!] simply because they never researched the actual events any further than the Silver Screen representation of same!

In this film production , while professional actors duly play Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, the 'real' Simpson and Yates comment on the film as the film progresses. I don't mean some viewer option 'commentary' DVD machine turn on/turn off kind of thing, I mean the actual 'visuals' of the real Joe Simpson and Simon Yates commenting throughout the film itself. One could say it's a documentary versus 'movie' per se but the direct input of Simpson and Yates, at least in this case and IMO of course, only adds to the film. And its accuracy.

Now for the biggie: It's hardly any secret that Simon Yates took some heavy flak from certain folks in the mountaineering fraternity citing what they believe to be the unwritten code or ""golden rule"", viz., ""you don't cut the rope!"" That's of course very easy to say when it's someone 'else' who is involved in such horror filled time spans but my own feeling is who is to say what one will do or not do in such dire circumstances! And keep this one in mind: I keep hearing as the alleged 'primary' reason for Yates cutting the rope [from various and sundry who are highly critical of Yates] that, ""Yates says he thought Simpson was dead"" and followed by ""how could Yates ever know this!"" but I suggest that Yates believing Simpson was dead was a 'secondary' consideration and the 'primary' consideration was the FACT that Yates was 'himself' being slowly but surely edged off the mountain. In effect, 'both' climbers could have fallen had the rope not been cut and who is to say the result then!

Further, and of cogence, Simpson 'defended' the action of Yates cutting the rope. Simpson also dedicated his book to Simon Yates. Recall too that in the real drama, Simpson landed on a small ledge ""within a few feet of a deep drop-off"" within the crevasse. Who is to say what the impact of that ledge landing would have been had 'both' men tumbled off the mountain? Yates could not pull Simpson up nor was Simpson capable of assisting in any upward climb on the rope, Yates was himself being edged off the vertical and into oblivion by the weight of the rope -- what does one do! Finally, and think about this one, Simpson was freezing to death on the end of that rope during the storm and, ironically, landing in the crevasse after the rope was cut actually sheltered him [such as it was but nevertheless shelter] from the brunt of the storm and significantly reduced the effect of the storm winds [while dangling on the rope] with regard to acute hypothermia and wind-chill issues.

On the other hand, we have a situation here where both men did survive  and were able to fill in the gaps as to what happened versus some 'conjectured' scenario of having no input from the original climbers involved. And, hey, OK, I'll play, what would 'I' have done? I don't know! I've mercifully not been in a situation like that but what I'm grousing about are those Yates detractors who were not there yet castigate Yates by simply parroting ""You don't cut the rope!"" ad infinitum suggesting that no matter the circumstances, ahhh, 'they' would 'never' conceive of doing such a thing. No-no, not they! 'They' would allegedly die first, kind of thing, and allegedly never even give a passing thought to touching that rope but I'm not so sure that kind of statement can be made when the speaker of same is not the one involved in the decision! Or the intense physical and psychological stress of the moment as one is being edged off the mountain and into oblivion themselves!

It's a gripping film and has various extras including the making of the film featurette and ""Return to Siula Grande"" with further interviews with Joe Simpson and Simon Yates. BTW, it also shows the truism that the 'majority' of accidents in mountaineering endeavors occur on the 'descent' versus the 'ascent' -- as the most recent K2 tragedy [August 1, 2008] well demonstrates where 11 experienced climbers were killed.

2051276,4,B00020BW4G,"The simplest of words can sometimes convey far more than the most elaborate action scenes. This runs counter to the whole `a picture is worth a thousand words', yet is nonetheless true.
  This film is a docudrama about two young British mountaineers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, who in 1985 decided to become the first men to ever scale a treacherous Andean peak in Peru called Siula Grande. They left for their task with a third climber who was to wait at their base camp- Richard Hawking.
  The film documents the weeklong adventure Joe and Simon had. The first three days were rather uneventful, and the duo reached the summit. It was on the way down that trouble hit. Freak storms were the first augur of bad things to come. Then Joe broke his leg and Simon was left to innovate a technique to lower his partner down the mountainside in 150 foot increments. Then, a second accident befell the duo. In a blizzard, Simon lowered Joe over an overhang that hung over a massive crevasse. When Joe could not signal what had occurred Simon was left in the precarious position of being unable to lift his partner back, and slowly being dragged down the face himself. After a few hours with no signal from Joe Simon made a fateful decision to cut the rope to Joe, assuming he had died and was a dead weight, lest he face sure death as well.
  Joe fell into the crevasse, where he dangled for hours. The next morning, a shaken Simon looked in vain, and assumed his partner had died. Simon made it back to the base camp, nearly dead from frostbite, and needed a few days to recover physically and emotionally with Richard. Joe, meanwhile, after much frustration, lowered himself into the crevasse and made his way out, then spent several days painfully eking his way down the mountain with an improvised splint, over glaciers and rock fields. The last night that Simon and Richard were at camp they heard Joe's cries and were shocked that he survived.... this is a terrific film as documentary and adventure. A viewer can understand why these adventurers do what they do, as well as recoil from it. Watching Joe Simpson narrate his tale you can see him do both at once, sometimes.

During the climb, one mistake leads one of them to make a life or death decision. It is what happened afterward that makes this film a nail-biter.

2051296,5,B00020BW4G,"This is the story of two young Brits who scaled a particularly treacherous mountain, the Siula Grande, in the Peruvian Andes in 1985.  Not anticipating the difficulty of the summit climb, the ordeal of inclement weather, and even greater difficulty of the descent, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, then in their early twenties, undertook to make their ascent in one push, carrying on their backs all the supplies they expected to need.  Wholely dependent upon each other for success and survival, Joe Simpson falls during their descent and suffers a particularly nasty, life-threatening broken leg.  Yates then undertakes to lower Simpson on a hundred meter line through blizzard conditions until there comes that dreaded moment when he can no longer feel Simpson's tug on the line and, to save his own life, must sever it.  Miraculously, Simpson survives the fall.  Then each must make his way down the mountain on his own.  Though it seems to doubtful that this will be possible with such a severe injury, Simpson musters enormous physical and emotional reserves to manage to survive.  It's a haunting tale, and much of it is told by each man facing a camera narrating his story in nearly deadpan style.  Joe Simpson wrote a book about his experience, and has gone on to become a writer.  Simon Yates meanwhile has become an adventurer.  To make the film, each man has to return to Siula Grande, and that turns out to be a difficult emotional journey.  Filmmaker Kevin MacDonald's interweaving of the men's narratives with careful reenactments makes for a sumptuous, beautifully filmed, and riveting viewing experience.  In addition, there are terrific special features telling more details of the return to civilization and what life has been like for each man since.",1186272000,3,1766,5.010273972602739

2051302,5,B00020BW4G,"When I hear the word ""docudrama,"" I usually laugh and think of the silly reenactments on CourtTV.  I also think of prisoners and prison guards strutting before a camera, trying hard to make their lives and worlds significant to the law-abiding (or mostly law-abiding) people at home on their couches.  There's a lot of flashing, fear-flavored graphics and sound effects, nauseating camera zooms, and an overbearing narrator manufacturing gravitas.  The stories are compelling, but it's the manner in which they are presented that strikes me wrong.  There's no ""drama,"" but rather a cheap off-brand, melodrama, and the overall effect is one of flaccid entertainment instead of genuine humanity.

Touching the Void captures the true scope of a docudrama project.  The goal is to as accurately as possible recreate the impossible.  Director Kevin MacDonald's blend of gorgeous footage with crisp sound effects made me physically colder just watching and listening to them.

The best parts of the movie are those where the viewer feels that the director is attempting something new.  Most of the film is a straightforward docudrama where the real-life people participate with artists in documenting and recreating the drama of an ordeal.  There are moments, however, when artistic license intensifies the truth.  Perhaps an ice axe tings sharply, and the sound seems to glisten like sunlight off the surrounding snow.  My favorite, however, is when MacDonald accurately films what it's like to have a song truly lodged in your head.  At that moment, I felt like I was watching and listening to something new.

There are plenty of movies about mountain climbing.  Recent Everest expeditions on the Discovery Channel are intense: deformations from frostbite, poor decision-making in delirium, and even a climber's frozen death.  As exciting as those Discovery Channel documentaries are, they still feel like prison melodramas to me.  In Touching the Void, there's no real base camp or tanks of oxygen, just two young men moving up a large rock no one had ever climbed back in 1985.",1171324800,2,2075,5.201807228915663

Your given a running commentary of both climbers during the film but the DVD really shines when you see the ""Making of"" segment included as an extra. What the viewer may not know is that all the filming of ""Touching"" was done on site and all 3 main characters were present during the filming. They added context, preserved the story's integrity and helped the production crew understand the amount of respect that the mountain deserved.

As many people who have gone through traumatic experiences of this grade know, you have little desire to relive them but sometime later one is led back to the scene... to recapture a piece of themselves that has been stolen. The DVD extras examine Joe and Simon's separate but joint quest. The intra\interpersonal emotional conflicts are evidenced in their dialogue and the interaction with the film crew. The strain, stress and consequences of uncontrollable events as well as  their actions are laid bare before you to see. It helps the viewer understand the context upon which these choices were made, the weight that was shouldered then and the impact it has upon them on a daily basis.

It's amazing that both have survived, not just the events on Sula but the aftermath and all the armchair criticism that has been uttered since. This  DVD set in its' entirety is a tribute to the capacity of man to survive and overcome incredible odds. Both Simon and Joe are to be commended at their miraculous survival against nature.

This movie is close to two hours in length and something which I think should be appreciated on the big screen.  So as to depict the event and to give credibility to the story, the Director invited the two mountaineers and one of their mate (who was looking after the base camp) back to Peru where it all began.  Interviews were granted (some of them did open a can of worms and bringing those unpleasant memory back especially Joel, the person who was at the receiving end when his partner, Simon cut the rope where he couldn't communicate with Joel and that he was in a dire strait situation himself.  Simon lived through the ordeal with his chin up despite copping a lot of flakes from other mountaineers for cutting the rope.  Anyway, Joel was defending him staunchly over the years.

It seemed similar to Beck Weather's Left For Dead and Aaron Ralston's Between a Rock and a Hard Place in this respect.

In the film however, it is clear that neither climber was proud of what happened and that to this day they are still carrying heavy emotional baggage because of it. In my mind, the film was an ecellent showcase of human determination and emotion.

While watchin the film I had to laugh a couple of times at the absolute absurdity of the hardships endured by Simpson. If this was a fictional story I would have turned it off because it was too far fetched. However this is a true story.

Picture hell with your minds eye. Then picture yourself placed squarely within the depths of the devil's lair. Imagine the worst fear you have ever felt and couple this with the most painful experience you've ever been privy to.

Multiply that by 1000 and you still don't have an estimation of what the men in this story went through!

The Extremes

Joey Simpson and Simon Yates are the only men to ever successfully climb Mt. Siula Grande. Their feat has never been repeated. While watching this movie I realized why this is so. The terrain they chose to traverse is so hostile towards anything human that one wonders how they could even conceive to undertake the challenge.

2 men, minimal supplies, no backup, no support, no GPS tracking, no modern technology. This is how they chose to tackle the mountain. They did this in what seems to me, a bold and stoic stance in front of God while shouting:

  Here I am, I am ready to vindicate my existence!

This, in my mind, is the greatest vindication of one's existence: To go against nature with no hope of survival, to stare certain death in the face, to encounter madness and still survive to tell the story.

Purists

The first 15 minutes of the movie is all about how they make it up the mountain. They chose to use the single push Alpine style of mountain climbing. In this style one does not scout the mountain and set up various camps and supply points throughout the proposed route. In this style, you carry all your supplies in your backpack and, in one powerful push, you climb up and down the mountain. It is, to quote Joe, the purest form of mountain climbing.

Saving My Brother

The descent, during which 80% of mountain climbing accidents occur, proved more perilous than the ascent. It is during the descent that Joe slipped and got injured, a fate which, under such conditions, is indicative of certain death for both climbers. The impact of his fall was so great as to almost split his leg in half!

It is here that Sam proved to be an exceptional human being. Instead of abandoning his colleague, as he was expected to, he attempts to get his partner to safety by lowering him down in 300 foot drops using a lengthy rope.

The situation quickly deteriorates and one accident follows another. Not only do they run out of gas and therefore water, but they also run out of any other supplies. At that point, the worst possible accident happens and Joe falls over a cliff edge and into a chasm.

The transformation

Great adversity often causes a change in a man. This psycho-emotional change is often marked by dramatic physical changes (as I've described before).

Sam assumes that his colleague is dead and cuts the rope that joins them. When he does make it to the basecamp, their travel mate notes the following:

  You wouldn't recognize him.... He didn't look human....

In the meantime, Joe undergoes a trip to the very nadir of depression and back to the zenith of superhumanity. He gives up trying to climb out of the crevasse. He gives up waiting for benevolent help. He decides to do the impossible: He descends into the bottomless crevasse. This is the self same crevasse that he described thus:

  ....I tried to use my torch to look into the crevasse. It went down forever.... The darkness just completely swallowed the light...

When he eventually does make it out of the crevasse he finds that he has an entire glacier to traverse. The situation is exacerbate by the powder snow which completely covers the tracks left by his companion. He suffers from severe dehydration. The glacier is marked by snow patches that cover crevasses. One false step and you are guaranteed a certain and swift death.

The Guardian Angel Within

4 days later, crawling along on one leg, he makes it to the moraine which is covered with boulders. Every hop he makes there after results in him falling and injuring himself on the boulders. Yet, somehow, he makes it across and to the basecamp. Here's how he describes it:

  ...I set goals.. I decided to make it to the next boulder in 20 minutes.... It became obsessive...If I made it in less than 20 minutes I was overjoyed....If I took longer I would get mad at myself...

Later, he starts going mad. He hears voices and the pain becomes excruciating. He finds comfort in the warmth of wetting himself. He loses all human dignity. Even then, he talks of the calm, unfeeling, hard voice of infinity that urges him on;

  ...The voice would tell me to get up..""No time to rest, no time to nurse the pain"".... The voice wasn't mine...My mind would just observe and take everything in... The voice would force me to move...

I Rescued Myself

Eventually, he makes it to the basecamp. He shouts Sam's name continuously. When their travel mate hears it he thinks the following:

  ...I could hear Joe's voice call out to Sam.... But that couldn't be because Joe was dead...And if he wasn't then whatever was out there could not be human...Having gone through what he had gone through, the creature that was out there could not be Joe, It couldn't be human

Summary

Challenging death in such a manner is the ultimate vindication of one's existence. To face God and come out a victor and an equal is the ultimate proof that we are made in his image. There's no luck involved in this ordeal. There is only heart.

Shot in a semi-documentary format (I'd call it ""reenactment,"" but that wouldn't do the film justice), this film delivers one of the most gripping tales I have ever been delighted by.  I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen.  TOUCHING THE VOID chronicles the real-life adventures of two mountain climbers--men who rush off to conquer a mountain and end up conquering themselves.  It is a climb that few had attempted before them and none had succeeded; it is also a climb that no one has since every attempted.

But this is not a typical ""hero"" story.  Our protagonists do not simply ""find"" themselves on the mountain.  Rather, the mountain destroys them and the audience gets to watch as these men hang on for dear life.  The fact that it is shot in a documentary-style lends the film an incredible sense of realism.  Macdonald's amazing camera shots and scenes of the mountain lend the film even more credibility.  And to top it off, the ""acting"" in this film is quite good.  This is not a PBS documentary with stage actors in fake costumes: here we get real climbers, with real frostbite, sometimes in real pain.

I cannot say too much about TOUCHING THE VOID without giving too much away.  Suffice it to say that it is a compelling story brought the screen in a masterful way.  Perfect from start to finish.  Also check out the ""Behind the Scenes"" extras, featuring more footage and interviews of the actual climbers who braved Siula Grande more than twenty years ago.",1125360000,4,1571,4.654545454545454

The movie is sparse, with the words themselves a backdrop to the silence known by every climber, a silence that is filled by total focus on action and self preservation. The cinematography on the mountain was spectacular.

yet this film is not only about climbing.

2051362,4,B00020BW4G,"Up in the high mountains, you don't get hurt; you just die.  If you break your leg while climbing the frozen mountain in the Peruvian Andes, that means you are dead.  And if that happens to your partner, all you can do is to leave him there and pray for him.  That is precisely what happened to Joe Simpson and Simon Yates.

'Touching the Void' is a documentary film about this harrowing incident that happened in 1985, and the two principal mountain  climbers recount their seven days in Peru.  The film is based on the book written by Joe Simpson, whose experiences are most astonishing.

Though the film is called a documentary, director Kevin MacDonald decided to use a quite unique method of shooting.  The film is made with the interview footages with Yates and Simpson, and the re-enactment scenes shot in the real location in Peru and the Alps.  No soundstage shots are used, and you can easily discern that fact.

Though the story itself is very exciting, it is the descriptions of the psychology of the two climbers that is really haunting.  With burnt skin and dehydrated body, you cannot think normally.  When you hear music (I mean, in you mind), it's not a hymn, or classic music, not even a rap.  It's Boney M.  How terrible, and realistic.

But only one thing I didn't like.  The two climbers are in the re-enactment part are played by professsional actors Brendan Mackey and Nicholas Aaron, both of whom did very good job.  I think that their effective acting is convincing enough to justify the less inclusion of the frequent interviews with the real Simpson and Yates.

In 'Vertical Limit' (which I didn't hate watching) characters die instantly; here, if you ever die, you die slowly, alone, imaginging many things.  And even if you survive, you still have to survive your memory.  'Touching the void' is most authentic when it tells you the truths about the mountains.",1112227200,2,1889,4.718654434250764

It was hard for me to watch, but that is good it shows its a great film.

2051384,5,B00020BW4G,"To give you an idea how profoundly this film touched me...I began watching it late one night, and I had to go to bed with about 45 minutes left to go.  I hesitated for a good moment before stopping the DVD -- I didn't want to leave Joe stuck on the mountain!  I finished it the absolute first chance I had...I got up early the next morning.

Kevin Macdonald's accomplishment is as gripping as the story is captivating.  I basically knew what was going to happen, but I became completely engrossed in Joe's ordeal.  I wept at the end.

The cinematography and the merging of editing/film techniques add an other-worldly aire to scenes, not as a gimmick as comes across in many other films but as a vehicle to bring us into Joe's ordeal.  The fact that we hear the actual voices of the men involved lends an urgency that only documentary filmmaking can bring.  In one of the extras, Macdonald admits that he hates documentary recreations, but I've never seen them done quite this way before.  The authenticity of the actors and the scenery are so compelling that it is easy to forget that it is staged.

But what will stay with me for the longest time after witnessing this film is the complexity of relationship that the film captures.  I honestly didn't know who I liked when the story first got going.  By the end, those feelings had become even more ambiguous and complicated.  And then I watched the ""Making of"" featurette, which served to further muddy the waters of the interrelationship of these characters.  Relationships are messy as are human emotions.  Throw in moral choice and you find plenty of fuel for discussion and personal growth from the story.  I found myself being soft on Joe and hard on Simon, and Richard was often just annoying.

The story and experience is so full of pathos and angst, I just wish the men, especially Simon, would be more forthcoming and vulnerable.  But is suppose that is the antithesis of the mountainclimber mystique.  In many ways this film dares us to touch the void that is humanity.

This is one I'm going to buy.",1109116800,2,2063,4.6
2051385,4,B00020BW4G,"Not having read the bestselling book on which the movie is based, I felt I would be at a disadvantage, but was more than pleasantly surprised, and absorbed by this movie. Joe Simpson and Simon Yates narrate whilst actors reenact their almost disastrous but succesful climb of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, and the amazing events that unfolded during their descent. I won't dwell on the story (which has been told almost in entirety in other reviews), as watching the actual living mountaineers recount the story, obviously brings an inevitability to the final outcome. All that said, the camera work and Widescreen presentation is nothing short of breathtaking, showing the mountain, and the mountain range in all its beautiful and treacherous majesty. The true story of probably the most single minded, and amazing will to live saga of Joe Simpson after a fall shattered his leg, and was cut loose by his partner in an attempt to save them both is harrowing, compelling and will stay with you for a long time. The intercutting of the narration with the dramatic feel of the reenactment on screen gives a real emotion, and tension to the story despite knowing all ended well ultimately, and is a refreshing approach to film making. There are also some featurettes on the DVD, including a return to the mountain some 17 years later by the two climbers who helped with the filming, which adds another dimension to the film itself. This is NOT a hollywood escapade, or ""Vertical Limt"" nailbiter, but a sober and utterly dramatic piece of cinema, that even if you know nothing about Mountaineering is great viewing. You empathize almost with the peril and danger, and even though you know that these young men were here by choice, some might even say foolishly so, you get swept into the story completely. It's interesting to note that the mountain has NEVER been succesfully climbed since, a lesson for all perhaps?. 4.5 Stars. Enjoy",1108425600,,1936,4.86969696969697
2051386,5,B00020BW4G,"""Touching The Void"" is the story of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates ascent of Peru's Siula Grande in 1985. Simpson's book was so popular, director Kevin Macdonald pleaded to make it into a movie. Filmed in 2002 on location, this harrowing journey of two men is the true test of will, determination and the human spirit. The story is narrated by the two climbers as two actors reenact the climb on the mountain itself. The fact that you're listening to the two guys that this really happened to - makes it immediately real. The Peruvian peak is 21,000+ feet high with walls and snow banks close to 90 degrees at times. Until this climb by Simpson and Yates in '85, the peak had not been reached - due to the incredible danger and risk involved in getting to the top. The film is shot in beautiful anamorphic widescreen accompanied with 5.1 digital sound. The panoramic views of the mountains, snow formations and glaciers are stunning. ""Touching The Void"" centers around the two climbers uneventful ascent to the top, followed by tragic turns on their way down. At 19,000 feet Simpson falls, shattering his knee cap. Yates devises a plan to get them both down by using ropes - lowering Simpson 150 feet at a time and then doing the same for himself. On one of these 150 foot rope drops, Simpson goes over an edge and is left dangling in thin air, and unable to climb back up (with his broken leg and frozen hands). Yates spends several hours deciding what to do. While Yates himself is slipping off the mountain, he decides to cut the rope that holds his climbing partner. Certain that Simpson has fallen to his death, Yates finds a burrow to sleep in and continues on in the morning back down the mountain. Three days later Simpson shows up at the base camp - having crawled the entire way. There's so much more to the story, but I don't want to give it all away. The DVD extras are very worthwhile as well... a ""Making of"" featurette (showing the director, camera crew and actors and the difficulties they had back on the mountain); the ""Return to Siula Grande"" (showing Simpson and Yates returning to the mountain - the stress and anxiety they went through, as well as being stunt/body doubles for the actors on the mountain; and ""What Happened Next"" (told by Simpson and Yates of what happened just after Simpson crawled back to base camp - the two had to ride on donkeys back to town over the next two days, and then once in the hospital, the doctor's wouldn't help Simpson because they wanted to be paid up front). 107 minutes long and rated 'R' for a few cuss words - understandable in these circumstances. An amazing film. An amazing story (5 stars).",1106006400,4,2653,4.54070981210856
2051387,5,B00020BW4G,"I heard about this film on Ebert & Roeper and was very intrigued.  While the events in this movie happened in 1985 and became the subject of a million seller book in 1987, this was the first I had heard about Joe Simpson and Simon Yates.

At the time of this story they were tough, even brash, young adventurers in their early twenties who had decided to take on the previously unclimbed 21,000 foot Siula Grande in Peru.  Can you imagine such a decision from men, one 25 and another not quite 22?  Of course, it always such young men who possess the gift of a sense of immortality and indestructibility that have always taken on these impossible tasks.

The climb was harder than they had anticipated, and things were getting dangerously severe on their way down, when disaster struck:  Joe fell and broke his leg.  Simon decided to try to help his friend down and they worked out a method that got them a long way down, but their luck ran out.  Joe was lowered over a sheer drop and could not pull himself up nor could Simon pull him back.  The howling wind made it impossible for them to communicate with each other.  They were trapped in a deadly situation with almost no way out.

After waiting for hours, Simon, who would surely have died if he stayed where he was, made the hard decision to survive and cut the rope to Joe.  Joe fell a long way and crashed through the ice into a crevasse and fell some more onto a narrow ledge.  It turns out the Simon's decision saved both their lives, but at the time Simon looked for Joe's body assuming he was dead.  He couldn't find Joe and struggled back to camp, frostbitten and distraught over the loss of Joe.

How Joe survived would be unbelievable in a work of fiction.  It is an amazing true story of tenacity, will, and even dumb luck.

This movie combines the participants telling the story in their own voices with actors re-enacting the events.  Having the story told by the ones who lived through it gives the story an immediacy and veracity that actors alone could never provide, and seeing the stories portrayed as the story is being told to you makes their words more vivid.  Combined, the story is made more immediate, real, and heart pounding.

If you like stories of adventure, determination, and overcoming impossible odds, this is as fine a story as you are likely to find.

2051390,5,B00020BW4G,"Touching the Void is an amazing portrayal of a true story of one mans courage to survive. A documentary, but unlike any other I have ever seen, this movie is absolutely brilliant.

The story begins when 2 mountain climbers decide to tackle one of the most difficult peaks in Peru. When Joe slides from a dangerous cliff and is left dangling from the support of his partner climber, Simon is faced with the decision to cut the rope (and lose his friend), or they would both die. Simon's choice leads to Joe's drop down a deep crevace where his leg is broken.

The documentary that follows describes in detail the thought processes between each character. With no special effects, you get the impression that this is not acting - but a camera was there during the actual event. The acting is incredible - and the makeup entirely believable. An amazing portayal of the actual events that happened, Touching the Void manages to capture the heart of human spirit, and the selfishness of survival.

Touching the Void made me laugh, cry, gasp in fear, shake my head in amazement, and mostly realize what it means to be a survivor. I absolutely recommend this movie - it is a completely original documentary, and fantastic to see no Hollywood special effects, beautiful characters and predictable mind sets.

The reenacted footage moves seamlessly in and out of the dialogue by Joe Simpson and Simon Yates which, really, is every bit as fascinating as the actors' portrayals.

The only reason I'm not giving ""Touching the Void"" 5 Stars, and I must admit this is very elusive, is because something didn't quite make me cringe when Joe broke his leg, or feel his desperation when Simon cut his rope, or as he dragged himself down off Siula Grande and across the glacier.

Maybe it's simply that it's hard to feel all that much sympathy for him, since he knew the risks. More likely it's that Simpson's descriptions in the book were so riveting and I was spoiled.

Otherwise, a great movie for armchair climbers or even those that are not all that fascinated with climbing. Now, if I can just get my wife to give it a go, I know she'd like it too (though she would never admit it).",1099094400,,1112,4.383495145631068
2051393,5,B00020BW4G,"Climbers have always felt there was no need for the embarassing antics displayed in absurd films like Vertical Limit, MI-2, and Cliffhanger to get across the at-once dangerous and beautiful aspects of their sport.  In fact, it was believed that a truly talented director could convey those things quite well through a little creativity rather than resorting to nitro-glycerine and cheesey free-soloing scenes to add suspense.  So it was with great anticipation and a bit of skepticism that the release of this movie retelling the classic story of Joe Simpson's epic in the Andes was anticipated.  No one was let down.  This is a brilliantly done film, at the original scene, with the real climbers doing much of the legwork.  The climbing scenes are shot with authenticity, and even the actors portraying the climbers did a good job.  The horrible situation Simpson finds himself in and his deteriorating physical and mental condition are palpable and nerve-wracking.  The feeling of desperation and hopelessness reaches the same heights achieved in the book, as does the anxiety and anguish of Simon (his partner).  This is a classic film rendering of a classic book.  This is one movie you must see; who knows if another climbing story will ever be done as well.

Joe and Simon seem to have no problem making very un-flattering statements about how they felt and what decisions they made.

This is no hollywood film ... the experience just isn't something you could make up - but the production values are still first notch and the 'alternating narrative and reenactment' format really reminds you that these are real people and this is truely what they went through.",1097798400,6,559,4.863157894736842
2051405,5,B00020BW4G,"I got that quote from Mark Twight's book Extreme Alpinism.  He was describing a climb that he and his friends completed in Pakistan which took two days longer to complete because the altitude given for the peak they climbed was actually 4,000 feet higher than the map indicated.  Joe Simpson and Simon Yates similarly tread through unchartered routes, climbing through and over ice fields and dodging crevasses; no one had ever summited the 21,000-foot peak Siula Grande in the Andes mountains of Peru.  They made it without mishap to the top; the trouble started up top when they started down and ran into some weather, slowly fumbling their way down despite white-out conditions.  The next bad luck was Joe's first fall which broke his leg very badly causing internal bleeding, at still extreme altitude, in still white-out conditions.  The rest of the story is a literal crawl/slide descent for Joe whose ordeal this movie is mainly about; it's a miracle he survived at all given the conditions his body was in for the next 4 or 5 days without food, water, or shelter.  I'm a novice to all this mountaineering stuff, but I have heard much about this movie from mountaineers I've met.  I think this movie is one that those folks have seen more than 2 or 3 times.  The movie really captures the thoughts, feelings, pathos of mountaineers who find themselves in a trying, do or die, situation in which those emotions are not only amplified at high altitude, but they're also distorted somewhat because of the high altitude.  As the story is reenacted by actors, Joe and Simon discuss what transpired during their wilderness ordeal.  And as other reviewers have noted, Simon was criticized by the climbing community for cutting the rope from which Joe was being lowered down, though both Joe and Simon agree that  they thought it was reasonable given the circumstances.

This film is a great adventure/true story even if you have no interest in mountaineering; it's great exercise, although that was probably the last thing on these young men's minds during this trial by ice.",1097625600,3,2075,4.863636363636363
2051406,4,B00020BW4G,"""Touching the Void"" was also the name of the book that Joe Simpson wrote about the events shown in this astonishing movie.  In 1985 Simon Yates and Joe went on one of those ""we're going to do something that has never been done"" kind of Mountain Climbs - up a previously unconquered approach up Siula Grande in the Andes.

My wife told me that the film wasn't at all what she was expecting, so it is perhaps worth describing the format of the film.  A small film crew, a couple of actors and Joe and Simon themselves returned to Siula Grande in 2002.  Richard Hawking, who maintained the base camp at the foot of Siula Grande while Joe and Simon went off on their death-defying climb, comes along as well and seems to have one of the most balanced viewpoints among the original three members. The movie intercuts interviews with Joe and Simon and Richard with footage shot for this movie with actors portraying them.  The shots of the Andes and glaciers and icy crevaces are spectacular outdoor photography.  The present day Joe, Simon and Richard tell an absolutely spell-binding story of heroism and perseverence and bravery.

Well before the end of the movie I found myself wondering how in the world Simon ever made it off that mountain, and he had by far the easier time of it.  Joe's survival is one of the most incredible stories of human endurance you'll ever hear.  Seeing that both Joe and Simon made it to the making of this movie removes some of the tension of ""oh my goodness! will they make it!"" but knowing the ultimate outcome doesn't relieve the edge-of-your-seat-white-knuckle tension of hearing this incredible story.

As a bonus there is additional footage of ""what happens next"" plus a mini-documentary on the making of the movie. The movie essentially ends with Joe and Simon and Richard reunited at base camp. You KNOW that both climbers need urgent medical attention and Simon will require surgery for his shattered leg - and the ""what happens next"" fills in some of those blanks.

The behind-the-scenes documentary gives you an idea of why the story depicted in the movie ends where it does.  Simon comes under criticism from the climbing community when Joe and Richard are staunch supporters of his actions on the mountain.  Joe returns to the mountain and memories he has suppressed for 15 years come flooding painfully back and he withdraws from the remainder of the crew.  There is an emotional detachment in both men that seems odd to those of us in the audience - but none of us have descended from the top of Siula Grande. They both experienced horrors that can't really be imagined - even with the assistance of this movie.  They have mentally walled off the events of 1985 into a place they don't allow others to - and it seems obvious they don't want to go there either.

The ""special features"" complete the story, and don't diminish the magnitude of the bravery, perseverence, etc seen in the movie.

2051408,5,B00020BW4G,"TOUCHING THE VOID by Joe Simpson, based on his harrowing, unbelievable ordeal while climbing Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, is one of the classics of modern mountaineering literature.  While descending the mountain, which he and his partner Simon Yates successfully climbed, Simpson went over a blind ledge, shattering his knee.  Dangling in mid-air on the end of a rope, invisible to Yates who was holding on to the other end of the rope far above,  unable to descend further because of the distance to the surface below, and unable to climb up the rope because of his destroyed knee, their situation was impossible.  While holding the rope, Yates eventually found his seat on the slope giving way, so that he eventually would have been pulled down by Simpson's weight.  In a highly controversial decision--though it it must be pointed out that Simpson has reiterated repeatedly that the correct decision was made--Yates cut the rope.  Instead of dying, however, Simpson found himself inside an ice crevice.  From there, through an almost superhuman effort, he somehow managed to go all the way down the side of Siula Grande completely unaided and on a shattered leg.

I enjoyed the book upon which this film is based, but I might have enjoyed the movie even more.  The shots of Siula Grande, which is revealed as an astonishingly beautiful mountain, the interviews with the principal characters involved, and the remarkable recreations of the central events of the climb (by actors in the Alps), all give a visual vividness that is impossible with the book.  I definitely recommend reading the book, but I would recommend that any fan of the book see this film as well.  They are remarkably complementary.

The extras are very nearly as moving as the film itself.  Included is a disc recording the first return to Siula Grande by Simpson and Yates.  The intense emotional reactions of both of the principals to returning to the scene of such an amazing ordeal are quite disturbing to watch.  Both of them seem subdued in their reactions at first, but the transformation over them as the days pass is astonishing.  Simpson gradually becomes overwhelmed by being near the site of his accident, eventually becoming aggressive and moody with the others.  Yates becomes increasingly withdrawn and taciturn, and afterwards refuses to participate with the production any further.  This is the more remarkable because Yates was previously extremely cooperative, and, to be honest, a far more likable person than Simpson.  It is an emotional drama nearly as powerful as the main feature.

One need not be an outdoors man or woman to enjoy this film.  It is truly a movie about the refusal of the human spirit to quit or surrender.  It also chronicles one most amazing true stories of recent decades.",1093219200,5,2797,4.957081545064377

2051410,4,B00020BW4G,"You'll be lucky if you have any cuticles left by the time you've finished watching ""Touching the Void,"" a nail-biting documentary that chronicles a true-life tale of miraculous survival.  In 1985, two experienced mountain climbers, Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, set out to scale a peak in the Peruvian Andes.  Although they successfully reached the summit, disaster struck as they were making their way back down.  In the midst of a blinding blizzard, Joe slipped and broke his leg.  The film, based on the book by Joe Simpson himself, recounts the grueling ordeal both men underwent in their efforts to make it back to their base camp alive.

To fully dramatize the experience, director Kevin MacDonald filmed one-on-one interviews with the two survivors (as well as a third companion who didn't go up the mountain with them) commenting and reflecting on the event, then employed actors to reenact the event as it originally happened.  MacDonald has done an astonishing job capturing the edge-of-the-seat suspense inherent in the material, this despite the fact that we already know how it will all turn out. By plunging us directly into the heart of the action, we feel we are enduring every death-defying, heartbreaking moment right along with Joe and Simon.  ""Touching the Void"" is, if nothing else, a tour-de-force of breathtaking cinematography and stunt work, one that makes us identify with the characters every step of the way.

Yet, for all its technical expertise, ""Touching the Void"" is, first and foremost, a human document, a testament to the endurance and survivability of both the human body and the human spirit.  The amazing determination and perseverance demonstrated by the two men - especially by the then 25-year-old Joe as he struggles manfully, despite unendurable pain, to reach a place of safety - is inspiring even to those of us who do most of our adventuring from the comfort and safety of our living room armchair, a cold beer in hand.  The film also reveals, through their actions and their words twenty some years later, the character of the two men.  Simon has to live with the fact that, at a crucial moment in the crisis, he cut Joe loose from his line, consigning his partner to probable death so that he himself could survive - an action for which many fellow mountaineers later criticized Simon.  Yet, never once - either then or now - does Joe join in that criticism.  On the psychological level, we learn of the cavalcade of emotions and feelings Joe underwent in those moments of greatest desperation when he looked impending death square in the face.  This film is as much an adventure of the mind as it is of the body.  Paradoxically, at the same time as the film is showing us the indomitableness of the human spirit, it is reminding us how much we humans - even the most daring among us - are, ultimately, at the mercy of a far greater, impersonal and indifferent force known as Nature.

Thanks to the compelling, stranger-than-fiction quality of the tale and the technical brilliance used to re-create it, ""Touching the Void"" will have you chewing your fingernails down to a nub.",1091836800,5,3124,4.854990583804143
2051411,5,B00020BW4G,"I first heard about this DVD through an on-line rental service. It was a recommended documentary which sounded interesting. But interesting is an understatement! I loved this movie. I couldn't get it out of my head. I began telling friends and family about the story. I immediately bought the book so I could learn more of the two climbers and their story.

The DVD does a wonderful job. And the actors had great performances. They were totally convincing. The viewer has the feeling that he is right there on the face of those cliffs and glaciers.

I would suggest this movie to everyone. It doesn't matter that you're not a mountain climber. It matters that you are human and can feel what it's like to be fighting for your life!",1090972800,6,731,4.615384615384615
2051412,5,B00020BW4G,"Directed by Kevin MacDonald, this film relates the harrowing experiences of two young British climbers who, in 1985, attempted to climb Peru's Siula Grande, a mountain that had already defeated other climbing teams. After a difficult ascent, the two found real trouble as they attempted to return to their base when Joe Simpson broke his leg. When Simon Yates was later criticized for his actions during the climb, Simpson wrote a book to defend his friend and set the record straight, even dedicating the book to his colleague. Narrated by Yates and Simpson and intercut with reenactments on Siula Grande by actors, this documentary/drama is exciting and gripping.

I first saw Touching the Void in a small art-house theater in Chicago, the experience was closer to going to church than going to the movies.  The entire theater was dead quiet throughout the film but you could feel the tension throughout the room.  After it was over I felt like I had been holding my breath for an hour and a half - incredible when you consider that, this being a documentary, I more or less knew how it was going to end - and others I talked to in the theater expressed the same feelings.  I wasn't sure if anything would be lost in the transfer to DVD, it wasn't.  Not only was the story just as gripping on the small screen but the extra features made a perfect movie-going experience even better.  People marching off to see I, Robot or whatever other dreck Hollywood throws at us have no idea what they're missing in this masterpiece.",1090886400,47,1000,4.349462365591398
2051414,5,B00020BW4G,"This 2003 film is docu-drama about a real incident. In 1985, two young British mountain climbers attempted to climb a very dangerous mountain in the Andes. One of them broke a leg. The other one was supposed to bring his partner back to safety. But something happened. And this is their story.

  First of all, we all know they made it back because they are now in their forties and narrating the story. The climbing part is re-enacted by actors who managed to make it seem absolutely authentic and happening right before my eyes.

  All the viewer has to do is sit back and relax and watch the adventure. Right?

  Wrong.

  There is nothing relaxing about watching this film. It is harrowing, scary and frustrating. I had two thoughts: (1) that they were stupid for attempting this mountain the first place, and (2) that I was right there with them even though I found the tension almost unbearable. The film seemed too slow because I wanted to know what happened next. And yet I understand that every excruciating detail was important in order for me to really understand their ordeal. So every time it showed the two men today, calmly discussing the incident, I was relieved they were still alive, but I burned with curiosity about how they survived.

  This film totally involved me and left no room for thinking about anything else during the long 107 minutes it took to watch it. And then, when it was over, I watched all the special features ? such as how it was filmed, what happened to the two men after the film ended, and further interviews. It was an entire evening of sharing that mountain with them.

  I did enjoy the film and do recommend it. But just be prepared for nail-biting anxiety as well as an inspiring story of man?s will to survive. Recommended.",1090454400,4,1773,4.592356687898089
2051415,4,B00020BW4G,"""Touching the Void"" is a partly re-enacted documentary of a climb of the western face of the Siula Grande in Peru in 1985.  The details of the climb make for a fine and gripping film.
The brief details of the climb of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates is that their ascent is relatively straight forward despite the mountain being more technically difficult than they had expected.  It on the descent that problems really began.  Firstly and, obviously, critically, Simpson slipped on an ice ledge and smashed right leg.  The only piece of good fortune being that no bone penetrated the skin.  It was thus left to Yates to assist his partner to the base camp.
At this point, matters deteriorated further when Yates was forced to cut their connecting rope when Simpson had fallen over a cliff and was in danger of dragging his partner with him.  Yates then proceeded to climb down having realistically left Simpson for dead.  However, by a combination of luck and supreme courage, Simpson too made the descent but in a truly battered state.  He had, for example, lost one third of his body weight!
Upon the climbers return to their native England, Yates was apparently criticised for cutting Yates loose.  Simpson never joined this criticism but only praised Yates for his efforts.
The film is a re-enactment of the heroism of the two climbers.  It outlines to all that mountain climbing is a dangerous past time that only the foolish and/or the brave can contemplate.  The film should be seen by all if only for the wonderful telling of a story of heroism within a vast, magnificent and unforgiving landscape.",1089504000,6,1603,4.771739130434782
2051416,5,B00020BW4G,"Watching TOUCHING THE VOID, I was reminded of the dangers that face Real Men. This was after I chipped a nail while opening a can of non-alcoholic brew. But, at least my Mommie was sympathetic.
In 1985, two twenty-something Brits, Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, endeavored to climb the 21,000 foot Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. Climbing successfully to the top was easy compared to getting back down, during which Simpson falls off an ice wall driving a shin bone up through the kneecap and splitting his femur. The only good news is that the skin wasn't broken. As Simon subsequently struggles to get the two of them back off the peak, cruel bad luck and circumstance contrive to pitch Joe into a crevasse. Thinking his friend dead, Simon staggers into base camp and prepares to return home. In the meantime, Simpson, still alive, must either go it alone or face certain death from exhaustion and dehydration. Being ""between a rock and a hard place"" takes on new meaning.
Since this pseudo-documentary begins with interviews with the real Simon and Joe, the audience knows from the start that the latter lives. But that fact doesn't detract from the nail-biting nature of this superb depiction of dogged perseverance and survival recreated by the climbers' own words paired with a brilliant re-enactment of the story both in Peru and in the Alps in which Nicholas Aaron stars as Simon and Brendan Mackey as Joe. The visual link between the four is seamless because the actors are beat-up and sun and wind-burned to the point of being unrecognizable anyway. The climbing scenes, filmed by Kevin Macdonald at night and during storms as necessary to remain true to the story, are perhaps some of the best you'll ever see.
The only other film that comes to mind which gives real-life testimony to Man's remarkable ability to survive against the most terrible of Nature's odds is the THE ENDURANCE (2002), a brilliant chronicle of Ernest Shackleton's doomed 1914-1916 expedition to the South Pole.

2051417,3,B00020BW4G,"""Touching the Void"" is indeed a remarkable story of survival.  Joe Simpson's ordeal is vividly recaptured by director Kevin McDonald.  McDonald's rather straightforward style, with the real Joe Simpson and Simon Yates recounting their harrowing experience climbing, and then descending, the beautiful but brutal, Suila Grande, in the Peruvian Andes, works well here.  If there is hole in this story, and I think there is, it's in Simpson himself.  He's one cold fish, so it's hard to work up a real measure of empathy.  You half expect him to quote Nietzsche at some point.  No doubt he would tell you this bleak attitude toward life and death is what kept him going.  Maybe, but you get the sense that this heroic effort is being told by a mechanical man - and he was that way before Simpson cut the rope.  The only time I really felt for Simpson, was when he fell into delirium, and was plagued with memories of a bad song.  It's only then that his control slips, and seems human at last.",1089417600,6,990,4.611428571428571
2051418,5,B00020BW4G,"This story about an ill-fated Andean ascent by climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates is the most suspenseful outdoor-adventure film I have ever watched.  While the story is a reenactment, the seamless blending of interviews with the principals and action footage made it easy to become fully absorbed in the climbers' harrowing experience.  Their climb to the summit was standard mountaineering fare, but after Simpson breaks his leg on the way down (the film interestingly notes that 80% of injuries occur during the descent), the remainder of the film had me cringing and wincing from the sheer horror of what Simpson had to overcome to survive.  His struggle to extricate himself from an incredibly dire situation brought him as close to the brink of survival as a human being can go, and it was interesting to see how his character, with its strong suits in arrogance, determination, and logic, made this possible.  It was also fascinating to hear him describe how being beaten down so thoroughly by the elements utterly destroyed his ego and opened him to some interesting (if perhaps hallucinogenic) perceptions as he approached death.  But while Simpson lived through Hell on the expedition, I believe it was Yates who was ultimately the most damaged by the experience.  When Simpson broke his leg, Yates bravely attempted to lower him off the mountain with ropes.  At one point, however, with no visibility and no ability to hear each other, Yates didn't realize that he had lowered Simpson beyond an overhang where Simpson had no ability to cling to the cliff and take pressure off the rope.  Nor was Simpson able, with his broken leg and frozen hands, to climb back up.  After more than an hour of bracing himself against the weight of Simpson hanging from the rope, Yates made the agonizing decision to cut the rope.  He then assumed that Simpson had died by falling into a deep crevasse, and so did not stop to explore the crevasse or go back to look for Simpson.  The irony of his unknowing proximity during the agonizing ordeal that followed for Simpson no doubt haunts him.  Afterwards, Yates endured much criticism for his handling of the incident, though Simpson has continued to staunchly defend him.  In hearing the men describe the events in retrospect, it appeared to me that Simpson had been able to overcome the experience emotionally (despite some panicky flashbacks when he revisited the mountain years later) but that Yates continues to live with a burden of guilt and shame which, deserved or not, has caused him to throw up a defensive wall against any further emotional involvement or self-examination.  To me, both men are extraordinary, and their story is not only a spellbinding survival saga but a fascinating examination of human nature.",1089417600,5,2770,4.941810344827586
2051419,4,B00020BW4G,"TOUCHING THE VOID succeeds on many levels: it is a film about the power of Nature, the indomitable human spirit faced with survival, and the complexity of youthful delusions of grandeur that can result in tragic conflicts.  As written by mountaineer Joe Simpson and Directed by Kevin Macdonald the film is a docudrama, splicing on camera interviews of the three men (Joe Simpson, Simon Yates, and Richard Hawking) involved in the controversial 1985 mountain climbing incident on the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes with ""enacted"" episodes by actors Brendan Mackey, Nicholas Aaron, and Ollie Ryall.  The incident is well known - an climbing expedition on the virginal West face of the Siula Grande results in a rather routine ascent but on the descent trauma occurs: Joe breaks his leg in a fall and slides into a demonic crevasse while Simon, thinking  Joe is dead, cuts the supporting cord and descends to safety alone.  The majority of the film deals with Joe's thoughts of his impending death, his struggle to keep attempting to return to safety despite his broken leg and lack of food and water, and his ultimate encounter with the 'void' of the universe which consumes us all at the point of death.  The ending is history - Joe does live to tell (and write) this tale.  Though docudramas can often be interesting but uninvolving, TOUCHING THE VOID rivets the viewer to the tale by the unrelenting awe of how man is able to struggle against the odds of Nature and survive.  There are moments when the utter majesty of Siula Grande is presented as a lady of nature that refuses to be conquered and as such the photography and momentum of the director make this mountain the most important character in the story.  Both the real men relating their true adventure on camera and the actors making visual the terrifying reality of the event are superb.  Even for folks who shy away from the 'National Geographic-type' films will find this a compelling tale with many overlays about our place as man on the planet and in the universe.",1089331200,3,2035,4.7749287749287745

2051421,5,B00020BW4G,"""Touching the Void "" is a docudrama based on Joe Simpson's bestselling book about his nearly fatal 1985 mountaineering accident on Peru's Siula Grande. Simpson was 25 years old at the time, and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, was 21. The two young adventurers had it in mind to ""climb the world"". In 1985, they set out to ascend the as yet unclimbed west face of Siula Grande, to its peak at 21,000 feet. They climbed ""alpine style' with no  more gear than they would need to make it to the peak and back in about 3 days. They reached the peak -so far, so good- but the supposedly simpler route they chose for the descent turned out to be anything but, which delayed the descent, causing them to run out of gas to fuel a fire. Disaster struck on Day 4, when Joe Simpson fell, breaking his leg. In severe pain, his tibia thrust through his knee joint with such force that it split his femur, Joe was unable to continue the descent. Simon decided to lower Joe down the mountain on a rope, as fast as possible, 300 feet at a time. This worked up to the point that Joe was lowered off of an ice cliff. Hanging about 150 feet from the bottom and with no way to climb back up the rope, Joe was powerless. Simon could not see what the problem was, nor could he hold onto the rope indefinitely without being pulled down himself. So he made a controversial decision to save his own life. And that is really where the story begins.

Director Kevin MacDonald has intercut interview footage of the real Joe Simpson and  Simon Yates with re-enactments of the events in which the climbers are portrayed by actors. In this way, the two men narrate their own story, while Brendan Mackey, who plays Joe, and Nicholas Aaron, who plays Simon, dramatize the events. The reenactment was filmed on location in Peru, and close-ups were filmed in the European Alps. The photography is beautiful, and the climbing scenes seem authentic. Joe's struggle to survive, injured and malnourished, in one of the harshest climates on this planet is fascinating. I was grateful that director Kevin MacDonald decided that Joe and Simon should tell their own story. Joe's survival is so extraordinary that it might not be believed if there were no one to witness the circumstances under which he persevered, and the recreated footage perfectly illustrates his struggle. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's a great story, told effectively. As Joe Simpson's struggle was against the elements and in his own mind, a narration gets this across nicely, where a traditional narrative might fail.

The DVD: Bonus features include a  ""Making of"" documentary, a featurette entitled ""Return to Siula Grande"", and ""What Happens Next"", which picks up where the film left off and tells us how Joe eventually got treatment for his injuries. The ""making of "" documentary is 23 minutes long, includes interviews with director Kevin MacDonald, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, and takes a while to get going. I'd skip it. ""Return to Siula Grande"" documents Joe and Simon's return to the site of their fateful climb and contains more interview footage with Joe and Simon than the ""making of"". We actually learn more about the making of the movie from this featurette, even though it only covers the time the crew spent in Peru. Watch ""What Happens Next"" if you felt the film left you hanging. Subtitles available in English and Spanish.",1088294400,7,3381,4.704391891891892
2051422,4,B00020BW4G,"This film, based upon the international best seller of the same name, recounts an amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and the will to live, despite dire circumstances. About twenty or so years ago, British mountaineers Joe Simpson and his then climbing partner, Simon Yates, attempted to ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes, Suila Grande, a majestic 21,000 foot peak that was nearly inaccessible. These two intrepid climbers tackled the mountain alpine style and, surprisingly,  reached the summit, the first mountaineers to do so.
After reaching the summit, however, tragedy struck on their descent, when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, fell and hit a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg and rupturing his right knee. Beneath him was a seemingly endless fall to the bottom.  When Simon reached him, they both knew that the chances for getting Joe off the mountain were virtually non-existent. Yet, Simon Yates fashioned a daring plan to do just that. For the next few hours, they worked in tandem through a snowstorm, and managed a risky, yet effective, way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain.
Several thousand feet down, Joe, who was roped to Simon, dropped off an edge and found himself now free hanging in space, about six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge was over hung above him and the dark outline of a yawning crevasse lay directly below him. Joe could not get up, and Simon could not get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale. It is at this point in the film that the real story begins.
What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles. This is an absorbing, beautifully shot film. The story is told in a sort of unique docu-drama style, with actors re-enacting moments in this fantastic, true life  tale of survival, while Joe Simpson and Simon Yates narrate what happened on that mountain.  It is an absorbing piece of cinema, as it presents a somewhat novel and fresh way of telling this amazing survival story. The cinematography is  magnificent, as the film is shot in the Peruvian Andes, where the incident occurred. Moreover, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates do the actual climbing scenes in the film. All armchair climbers will thrill to the sound of their crampons and axes digging into the ice.
