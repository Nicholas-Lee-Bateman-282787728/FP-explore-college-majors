8316561,5,B0006BJG08,"This video trilogy is divided into three tapes that detail the progress of the three army groups that Hitler unleashed against Stalin in the battle known as ""Operation Barbarossa"", or Germany's invasion of Russia during the Second World War.  Taking footage from the propaganda films from both sides, one gets a feeling of traveling with the various German army groups during their ill-fated attack on Stalin's Russia.

This story is not told often enough, and needs to be exposed more in order for one to have a proper appreciation of the critical role played by Russia in defeating Hitler.  Perhaps this information is suppressed because the other allies would like to take more credit for defeating Hitler than is really deserved.  But  the story is fascinating, and these tapes do a good job of

giving the modern military historian a grasp of the outline of what happened.  The commentary by Professor John Erickson of Edinburgh University and Steven Walsh of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst is separated by hours of actual war footage,

for a very satisfying and comprehensive treatment in three 55 minute video tapes.",1107129600,7,1132,5.016042780748663
