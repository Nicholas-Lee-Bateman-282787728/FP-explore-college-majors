8081465,5,B000B5IOLG,"I can't believe how much I loved this movie, I also can't believe that I was so wrong about the subject matter. It is a very serious subject and it is interjected with a small amount of humor, not too much to make it inconsequential (the subject) but sprinkled in at just the right times. The acting is so good and I am talking about the 2 lead men the 50 something ""Mauro"" the nurse played by Maurizio Mattioli and the role of Rollo played by the magnificent Valerio Foglia Manzillo. The manic portrayal of Mauro was at times funny ad touching. The Part that Valerio had called for so many subtle nuances (can't believe I used that word) That he made me stand up and take notice and that isn't just because he is amazingly handsome, either. His performance was outstanding and I did not see much of his ""stuff"" coming either. I was in amazement with this whole movie and recommend it with all my heart. Be aware this was Italian with English subtitles.",1482796800,,953,4.420454545454546

8081469,3,B000B5IOLG,Certainly not an upbeat story. At times the violence gets disturbing. Human trafficking is obviously a sad reality and the film does a good job at transmitting the horror of it all.,1280880000,,181,4.6875
8081470,5,B000B5IOLG,"I don't know what the reviewer ""Gordon Larko"" is smoking. For some reason, he feels compelled to leave the EXACT SAME horrible review and 1 STAR rating for all GAY-THEMED movies. Probably a ""personal problem"" of his. Hopefully this review will help correct this imbalance. I can't believe AMAZON is allowing this GAY BASHER to use their website as a venue to spread his hate.
By the way, This is an absolutely WONDERFUL movie!",1235952000,,426,4.77027027027027
8081471,4,B000B5IOLG,"Without Conscience, directed by Stefano Reali
02 April 2006
Language: Italian
Original title: Verso Nord

Verso Nord (`Without Conscience') might take you off guard if you only glance at the cover, which, aside from showing one of the main male characters topless with a seductive look in his eyes, notes ""What some guys won't do for money!""

In fact, the film has little to do with the purported attractiveness of Rollo (Valero Foglia Manzillo) and everything to do with this man's childhood and grim past. The film is essentially about the child smuggling business in Italy today. The locations are realistic (the film opens at the port city of Brindisi, where many Albanians find their way to Italy, and incidentally, where many tourists travel to Greece) and the plot very plausible. A group of thugs from the southeastern region of Puglia (Apulia) kidnap the young Rollo and after desensitizing his every worldly perception through beatings and mistreatment, make him a `part of the family.'

As an adult, Rollo takes part in the same business that forced him into the nave servitude of the avaricious mafia. For the first time on screen, Bayed Mohamad Ismail (Eddi) plays a young adolescent Moroccan immigrant who is sold by his parents, brought to Italy, and eventually destined in an `escort' exchange in Switzerland, where he thinks he'll be meeting a foster family and where he hopes to have the opportunity to try out for a young soccer league.

Mauro (Maurizio Mattioli) is a male nurse in Rome [...] accepts an assignment given to him by the head physician to drive to Puglia and aid in the escort. Both Mauro and Eddi believe legitimately that a host family awaits them at the border near the Alps, but when they arrive, they learn quickly that the child trafficking business is not about uniting caring parents and desperately lost children.

The beginning of the film and in certain scenes towards the end, the language spoke is a regional dialect (and thus, considering an Italian audience, there are Italian subtitles in addition to optional English, French, or Spanish ones).",1143936000,15,2094,4.954415954415954
8081472,4,B000B5IOLG,"An intriguing film about the italian Mob and 2 misguided men, who help a entrapped and defenseless boy. Although, debatable as a gay genre film, the hot protagonist and his comrade will surprise you.",1137283200,11,199,4.882352941176471
8081473,5,B000B5IOLG,"'VERSO NORD' ('Without Conscience') is one of those unheralded Italian films that deal with controversial subjects while retaining a story of human compassion and love.  It is a film with equal parts brutality and tenderness and the direction and writing (Stefano Reali) and cast that make it work exceedingly well.

Mauro (Maurizio Mattioli) is an emotionally needy and lonely middle-aged male nurse, working for a physician (whom he wishes to impress) who connects Mauro with a group of questionable types led by Gino (Claudio Bigali) dealing in the transport of undocumented children from Morocco and other countries to 'buyers/adoptive parents'.  When Mauro meets the smarmy crew and the boy Eddi (Mohamed Ismail Bayed) is selected, he is joined by a strangely quiet, powerfully brutal fighter, but exceptionally handsome young man Rollo (Valerio Foglia Manzillo).  Mauro is the guardian, the driver of his boss' Mercedes, and the verbal member of the unlikely trio as they begin their drive from Rome to the Swiss border.  Rollo is mysterious, seems to react to stimuli in a Pavlovian way, gets in to fights and trouble from the start, but becomes increasingly devoted to the mute Eddi in the back seat.

Mauro and Rollo gradually form an alliance out of need and out of mutual growing love for Eddi and for each other.  Mauro senses a feral quality in Rollo, realizes through his inappropriate behavior towards bar girls that he has never experienced intimacy, and finds a prostitute Elena (Ana Papadopulu) who not only fills the sexual void in Rollo's life but also begins to teach him the gentle quality of intimacy.  But with her comes the baggage of criminal pimps who further hamper the safety of Mauro's delivery mission. The film develops into a chase film with the now quartet of Mauro, Rollo, Eddi, and Elena madly striving to reach the safety of the Swiss border and the reward of delivering Eddi to adoptive parents.  The manner in which the movie ends is best left to the discovery of the individual viewer: the unlikely pairing of Mauro and Rollo serves as the nidus for one of the more beautiful friendships on film.

The acting is exceptional in this film: Maurizio Mattioli creates a gay character impossible not to love while the inordinately handsome and charismatic Valerio Foglia Manzillo brings a presence to the screen that promises an exciting career! Stefano Reali finds just the right balance between the always popular gangster atmosphere films and the intensely personal views of unexpected human love stories.  The pacing is breathtaking, the cinematography is magnificent, and the message is timely and universal.  In Italian, French, Bulgarian, etc and with English subtitles.  Recommended.
