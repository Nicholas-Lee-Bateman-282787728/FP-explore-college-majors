8712271,2,B00W67RNJQ,"While there were a few modestly enjoyable/interesting comedy shorts on volume one, volume two is even more of a disappointment than volume one.",1442880000,,143,5.260869565217392
8712272,5,B00W67RNJQ,"(I'm posting this info from the DVD box since the blurb and film titles are not appearing on the listing for some reason.)

This second volume of ""whirls"" from the 1916-17 silent comedy film series THE MISHAPS OF MUSTY SUFFER features four more entries in which Musty Suffer works in an arcade and as a messenger boy, has his body and face repeatedly mangled in the hopes of getting a meal, and is gifted a pantomime horse by the itinerant Fairy Tramp for a business opportunity. Also on the DVD as bonuses are Bickel & Watson's first film from 1915, and a 1910 newsreel that contains footage of them as members of a clown band as well as of Bert Williams doing some of his boxing routine.

These films have been preserved by the Library of Congress and have never been available on video. New musical scores for all six films have been composed and recorded by Ben Model.

8712273,5,B00W67RNJQ,"This is a great companion piece to the first volume of Musty Suffer films, and I recommend it to everyone, whether you have the first release or not. Volume 2 gives us another visit to the hilarious and surreal world that Musty barely survives in. Either you're laughing at his antics, or your jaw is dropping in suspended disbelief at his predicaments. The bonus features on this disc are amazing as well, and offer a great glimpse into not just the early days of film making, but the talented individuals who worked both in front of, and behind, the cameras.",1430611200,4,560,4.61
8712274,5,B00W67RNJQ,"really excited to receive one of the very first shipped and it was a true blast attaching 4 more WHIRLS of MUSTY Suffer and the incredo Actor's Fund film made at the Polo Grounds showing Ziegfeld stars Watson & Bickel rock it out as clowns. I was a backer of this project initially, and know the producer, but he did not ask I write this. I endorse this because it is a fine product in every way from clarity to packaging to the platforming of the architecture of the DVD. It's great stuff and I'm thrilled to have it.",1429142400,6,518,4.242424242424242
8712275,5,B00W67RNJQ,Thanks to Ben Model & Steve Massa for curating another volume of these undeservedly unseen & forgotten delights! UNDERCRANK PRODUCTIONS is doing extraordinary work for film preservation. Don't miss their other releases. Bravo!.,1429142400,3,227,5.909090909090909
