I really wanted to get her tapes and use them but I might as well give them away...

5768277,4,B00D2UMHOC,I would recommend this video to anyone who has some rhythm and likes a different kind of workout.  Tracey's workouts are unique and specific.  Some parts of the workout I can see someone without any rhythm having difficulty following it.,1377734400,,237,4.9
5768278,4,B00D2UMHOC,"I was excited to buy this rerelease because I'm a huge fan of Tracy's mat workout.  Now I know Tracy isn't for everyone, but if you stick with her, you will see results.  I've been working out 6-7 days a week for about the last 7 years (running, doing dvd's, yoga, everything!) and I can honestly say that Tracy's method has been a great addition to my routine.  Before her mat workout, I never had defined obliques or shoulders.  Now I've only done the Perfect Design Series Level 2 workout 3 times, but I can say the leg and ab sections are awesome!  However, the standing ab and arm section is abysmal.  I can pick up choreography pretty quickly, but there isn't any here.  What happened?  I'll be doing the leg and ab section on this dvd and then be finishing my workout with the arms and standing abs from Tracy's mat workout.",1376784000,8,831,4.38562091503268
5768279,4,B00D2UMHOC,"Tracy's Perfect Design Series (PDS) came out a few years ago, and I never purchased it since the cost was so high for all three DVDs.  When I saw that it was being re-released, I decided to spring for the first two, and I really like them so far!

As I mentioned, this is a re-release, so it's the exact same workout as the original PDS Sequence 2.  (I just want to caution everyone so that they don't accidentally re-purchase a DVD that they might already own!)

The workout comes in at about 48 minutes, and is broken down as follows:

*  Warm-up -- about 4 or 5 minutes
*  Standing toning using the chair -- about 28 minutes
*  Floor toning using the chair -- about 11 minutes
*  General toning -- about 5 minutes

To do the workout, you'll want a mat and a chair.  Tracy is also incredibly creative with her use of the chair in PDS2.  You'll be using it not only for leg lifts, but also for interesting moves where you balance on it or do ab work with your legs on it.

If you're new to Tracy Anderson, her emphasis is on doing what she calls ""muscular structure"" moves to work the smaller ""accessory muscles.""  Her workouts are really unique, and this one has you doing some unusual moves, such as lying on your stomach while moving your legs out sideways.

This is definitely an advanced workout, and I found that I lacked the strength to do some of the moves.  When I come back and use this more, I will plan on doing PDS 1 for awhile before I build up to PDS 2.  From what I have read online, a lot of women use Sequence 1 for a few weeks, before moving on to Sequences 2 and 3.  Tracy usually tells you not to do the same workout more than ten days in a row so that your body keeps making progress.

The workout will definitely work you from head to toe, and I was pleasantly sore after doing it.  I have her Mat, Post-Pregnancy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-s-Metamorphosis-Hipcentric/dp/B00BPDI5DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - Hipcentric</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-s-Metamorphosis-Glutecentric/dp/B00BPDJHUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - Glutecentric</a>&nbsp;workouts, and I found some really unique moves in PDS 2 that I hadn't encountered in any of her other DVDs.

If you're new to Tracy Anderson, you may want to start with her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-Method-Mat-Workout/dp/B008DL4JVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson Method: Mat Workout</a>&nbsp;disk instead of PDS 1 to get used to her method and moves. She is also coming out with a Beginner's workout (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Method-for-Beginners/dp/B00D2UMHC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Method for Beginners</a>) soon that would probably be good to get an overview of her system.

That being said, she does have much better cuing in the two PDS workouts I have than she has in the Metamorphosis workouts; there is a voiceover where she talks to you and gives you form pointers.  Don't expect too much emphasis, though, on how to do the moves; when I do any of TA's workouts, I'm always left wondering if I'm doing them quite right, and even reading her book didn't help me with that.

~~ Hope that helps! :-) ~~",1375747200,32,3397,5.366037735849057
5768290,1,B00D2UMHOC,"Different picture but sames video than the 2010 ""perfect design series"", don't buy of you already owned the 2010 serie",1393718400,,118,4.95
5768291,4,B00D2UMHOC,I like Tracy's workouts. I have only purchased two dvd's and am quite happy with this workout.  Only issue for me is that I seem to need more practice with the arm series.  It get's confusing. I am not the most coordinated person.  I also wish she could have a tutorial with the arm workouts.,1390608000,3,292,4.2727272727272725
5768292,5,B00D2UMHOC,"love her workouts!!!! Awesome - love how you feel every single move can wait until she stop,s but worth it",1388793600,,106,4.35
5768293,1,B00D2UMHOC,"This is more soft-porn than exercise video.

This woman performs in some kind of satin outfit that looks like it belongs in the bedroom. She maintains a perfect ""pouty"" mouth throughout the video. The ""instruction"" is a joke.

This video is slimy and disgusting.",1381190400,,262,4.931818181818182
5768294,1,B00D2UMHOC,It was repetitive and dull. I  didn't like it and don't know what all the fuss is about for her.,1381190400,,96,3.8
5768295,4,B00D2UMHOC,This is a great intermediate workout.  And it is cheaper than the metamorphis workout with virtually the same exercises. Especially if you want a great Pilates/Barre workout without investing a lot of money this is the workout for you.  The only criticism I have is that you have watch the video several times before attempting and starting with Seq I. Tracy Anderson is not very good at giving verbal queues or great instructions how to do the exercises (you have to watch her for how to).  Once you get accustom to Tracy Anderson's style you will like this workout.,1380672000,5,567,4.707070707070707
5768296,5,B00D2UMHOC,I have all of tracys.workout and my body is the best shape it has ever been. Like I always said before that if you are after the athletic manly look then her workout is not for you. If you are after the feminine petite look then her workout is for you. When I first got some of her DVD and did them I thought she was crazy and did not know what she was doing. I gave all of her DVD to a friend of mine. Well in 3 months she was so toned and looked like a model. I asked her what she was doing? She gave me a strange look and said you gave me those DVDs. I was like what DVD and she said the crazy lady Tracy and i was like huh. Well I rushed online and ordered all her DVD I could get and today I have my dream body. It takes patience with her method before you get it. People now walk up to and admire my arms and butt lol I swear.,1380326400,17,832,3.653631284916201
5768297,5,B00D2UMHOC,"I've had the Perfect Design Series in shrink wrap all these years. I've been more serious about Tracy's Method since September last year. I don't think this series is the best place to start for someone new to her technique. I love the ambiance, the moves... it's hard as nails at times. I was amazed to be able to follow the arm series, even though everybody says that it's completely over the place (it is, mind you :P).

So far I've completed omni, most of hip, have done some hip, omni and glute continuity, and I have all her other DVDs outside of metamorphosis, so I think this series it's better for someone trying to add variety after having more experience with Tracy's workouts.",1380153600,2,688,4.548387096774194
5768298,4,B00D2UMHOC,"This workout is very effective on the upper thighs and butt, lots of repetition that really tire the muscles.
Unfortunately, we feel the workout is incomplete due to the lack of arm routine.",1379203200,,190,4.787878787878788

8588680,3,B00D2UMHOC,"I have had this DVD series for a few years but I haven't done them in a while.  Well after doing this one today I decided to leave a review.
I liked the butt/leg portion of this DVD. I will definitely feel the burn tomorrow.  The ab section was just ok.  I have never been a fan of Tracy's ab work.  I feel like it is all the same crunch with just switching up your leg position.
  What really bummed me out about this paticualr dvd was that there was no arm section.  Tracy's arm sections are usually my favorite. She usually does some free arms and then some weighted arms.  However in here there is no separate arm section.  She try's to add in arms to the standing ab work. But when she does she completely abandons the standing abs.  And the free arms that she is doing just seems all over the place.  And of course she doesn't count reps, which is my biggest pet peeve about Tracy.  I understand that some of her moves are maybe to fast to count reps and that that's not her style. But if she cant stay consistent and do even reps on each side then she needs to be counting reps.
I have noticed this problem in SEVERAL of her dvds, especially her Continuity series.  She doesn't count reps so you end up doing more on one side then another.  Or in the case of this DVD she skips whole moves on different sides of the body. Its very frustrating.
Also her outfit is just ridiculous..",1477267200,2,1387,4.184905660377359
8588681,5,B00D2UMHOC,Love this sequence by Tracy.,1465344000,,28,4.8

8588683,3,B00D2UMHOC,I went through a Tracey Anderson phase. I liked her cardio dance portions. But the calisthenics were too repetitive and boring.,1430870400,,127,5.095238095238095
8588684,3,B00D2UMHOC,I like her exercises for the most part but she is an awful instuctor!  Sorry. Its more like a performance than an instructional DVD.  There is one section in particular that she tells you to look down and keep a long neck but then she changes exercises without even telling you.  Constatly have to look up to see what shes doing.  Frustrating!!! If she had a voice over to cue the moves I would buy it again.  I returned them.  I bought all three.,1427241600,,447,4.261904761904762

8588687,4,B00D2UMHOC,"After doing this workout, I felt compelled to write a review after reading some of the less positive reviews. As a licensed massage therapist and personal trainer, this workout has benefits galore. First of all it is a low impact exercise so it is not hard on the joints. It is a more like pilates ballet fusion which also increases and warms the muscles for better flexability.  As a workout junkie for a woman in my 40's, I always did strength and cardio. I also have issues with my spine and joints. After doing this workout the first time I was sore the next day, something that is rare. My range of motion and flexabilty  has improved. The only things I didn't like about Tracy's DVDs is her cueing sucks so you really have to pay attention and she looks completely bored thru out the workouts. Other than that, I can honestly say you will sweat and get a good workout. I do cardio that I like after workout and alternating days. I plan on doing strength workouts too to confuse my muscles as well maybe once or twice weekly. my legs are more toned and defined and have more flexability. Also, use ankle and wrist weights the easier it becomes.",1408838400,12,1149,4.440758293838862
8588688,2,B00D2UMHOC,"Be careful when using this product. I torn 2 of my rotator cuff muscles in my shoulder on this product.  Cheap CD, skips after a month or so use.  No I don recommend.",1403222400,,166,4.0
8588689,5,B00D2UMHOC,"I absolutely love this dvd.  Got it at the library and bought it right afterwards (along with a cardio and mat workout by tracy).  I was sort of put off by the satin exercise outfit she had on, but gave it a try anyways-- I can overlook that.  The music is great and it felt like she worked every muscle in my body.  The next day, I was exhausted (in her interview, she says to expect that because it is a total body workout).  I am no stranger to home exercise DVDs, and I have never felt so spent.  I've done the tape a dozen times since, and feel really great.  Tracy says to pay proper attention to form to achieve results, and I was conscious of that throughout.  The only part I really struggle with is when you have on leg on the chair and then have to kick it forward.  Yikes.  Tracy's method is sort of loosey goosey, so if you are yearning for a dvd where the instructor counts reps, don't buy this.  On the other hand, her method makes for a very relaxing workout.  Sounds like an oxymoron, but it really is true.",1396396800,7,1024,4.1421319796954315
