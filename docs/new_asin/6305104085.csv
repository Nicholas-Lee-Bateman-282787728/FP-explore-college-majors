8239345,1,6305104085,"It's all in chinese and the movie is just too long. Yeah, man.. I sat through the entire thing... I fell asleep twice...",1217548800,,120,4.260869565217392
8239346,5,6305104085,"this movie is great. one of the best fantasy kung fu films i ever seen. gordon has no business being on the front. this is also a very funny movie. i laughed plenty and the action is top notch. lots of flying and super powers, just how i like my fantasy flicks. one of the best in my very large collection.",1214438400,,306,4.032786885245901
8239347,5,6305104085,"i will go ahead and still give this movie a 5 star rating even though this particular version of it is very hard to follow for non-chinese speaking folks.  the english subs are absolutely horrible on this film, and there is no english dub so it is at times hard to follow (especially during the daytime scenes where it is a white background against white subtitles) otherwise it has all the good (and stereotypical) elements of chinese cinema.  gordon is barely in the film and that is just another attempt to sucker western audiences with a familiar face (kill bill). so if you want to see gordon don't buy this.  if the production was better quality i believe the reviews would be better for this film, but since whoever ""remastered"" this didn't take anytime to make this easier for the average english speaking person to digest most will just feel like this is just another crappy kung fu movie...",1136937600,,900,4.647798742138365
8239348,2,6305104085,"One of the reasons for me purchasing the film was Gordon Liu's name on the cover.  It turns out he is in very little of the movie. The English subtitles are poorly translated and at times very difficult to read. The story line is even worse, hard to follow and has a ridiculous ""batman"" vampire character.

Do yourself a favor and buy a better Kung Fu movie.",1120694400,,358,4.3283582089552235
8239349,5,6305104085,"An excellent selection for a night of Chinese takeout and nonsensical kung fu. Every review on this page is absolutely correct; the film is poorly shot, the dialogue poorly translated (if at all), the action clumsy, the acting mediocre. It's so dizzyingly fragmented, it's wonderful. We could not for the life of us stop laughing. Just when we thought it couldn't get more bizarre than it had, the last scenes (I think it was supposed to be a conclusion of some sort) surpass all others in leaving the viewer completely bewildered and highly amused.",1030492800,,549,4.851063829787234
