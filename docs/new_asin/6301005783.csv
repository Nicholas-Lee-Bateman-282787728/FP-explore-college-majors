304136,4,6301005783,"Pretty much agree with the consensus that this is an above-average thriller most notable for its dark, shadowy look but somewhat marred by miscasting. To my way of thinking Lon Chaney, Jr. isn't really bad so much as he's just not a good fit for the role. He recites his lines earnestly and his physical presence suggests a hulking menace. But best of all in the acting department is the stunning Louise Allbritton. With her dyed black hair and chalky face, she slinks around in frilly white dresses that look more like nightgowns. In sum she's the very picture of the seductive female vampire.
Both the content and the style of Son strike me as dead-on film noir wrapped in horror film clothing: alluring femme fatale, doomed hero, lurking sense of dread, and most of all the murky visuals. An anomaly I've not noticed any commentators mention is that we have a story taking place in Louisiana but most of the characters speak with flat Middle American accents. Louise Allbritton's and Evelyn Ankers' tony, quasi mid-Atlantic delivery is even further off the mark. Oh, well, they didn't bother so much with such details back then. Another jarring practice is the decidedly un-pc rendering of the few black supporting characters which appear. I give this one four stars mostly for the drippingly atmospheric look and the acting of Allbritton and Robert Paige.",1406419200,,1359,4.887445887445887

304138,4,6301005783,"I had heard so many negative reviews of this film before I actually watched it for the first time, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""

Much of the negativity seemed to stem from the casting of Lon Chaney as a Hungarian Count who is supposed to be from the same gene pool as Bela Lugosi. And while I agree to a degree that Lon wasn't the most convincing Hungarian, the whole movie shouldn't be judged by that.

Indeed, ""Son of Dracula"" boasts some fine supporting performances--most notably Louise Albritton as the femme fatale vampire who succeeds in cuckolding Count Alucard & trying to lure Robert Paige's character over to the darkside. Props also to Robert Paige for not playing the usual dull & uninteresting romantic lead so typical of many of the Universal horror pictures.

Frank Craven & J. Edward Bromberg add to the stellar supporting cast & I might add that the oft-derided Chaney is not a total washout in his performance as Alucard. He has quite a few effective moments--particularly when it comes to displaying the supernatural strength of the undead.

Overall, I would say ""Son"" is definitely worth repeat viewings & far from the travesty many critics have proclaimed it to be. 4 stars",1371859200,,1238,4.771028037383178
304139,3,6301005783,"A rich southern belle that is obsessed with the occult falls under the influence of the mysterious Count Alucard after visiting Budapest. Returning home, the two are quickly married and take over the family estate, but it would seem that Katherine has her own secret agenda for the Count! Eerie and atmospheric, SON OF DRACULA succeeds most with its incredible special effects, which take a huge leap forward from the previous films in the series. Here, Dracula transforms into a bat and a cloud of mist right before our very eyes! The fog-laden swamps of the Louisiana bayou also serve as a fine change of locale from London, giving the vampire reign over a brand new land. Director Robert Siodmak does a fine job here, with early elements of the Film Noir style seeping into the shadowy crime drama found in brother Curt's script. Lon Chaney Jr.'s performance as Dracula is as lifeless as the character he portrays. He does not capture the sophisticated aristocrat, but rather an oafish brute. Louise Allbritton, on the other hand, is a much more compelling lead, both a stark beauty and a manipulative con. SON OF DRACULA is a fitting sequel to Lugosi's original that is sure to impress fans of the classics!

Though not as interesting a ""Dracula's Daughter"" the biggest problem with this film is getting used to Chaney Jr. as Dracula!

He played the Wolfman(The Wolfman, Frankenstein meets the Wolfman,House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein), Frankenstein's Monster(The Ghost of Frankenstein), The Mummy(The Mummy's Tomb, The Mummy's Ghost, The Mummy's Curse) and Dracula(well the son of) not to mention a slew of other maniacs.

304145,3,6301005783,"Probably no horror film of the classic era, or its star, has been as maligned as ""Son of Dracula"" starring Lon Chaney, Jr.  But here's the blatant truth:  the film's pretty darn good, despite its dopey and misleading title, and Chaney -- in remarkably flattering makeup and costume -- pulls the role off far more competently than anyone has a right to expect.  Sure, he's not Lugosi -- only Lugosi was Lugosi -- but Chaney plays Dracula better than Lugosi could have played Lennie in ""Of Mice and Men.""  The southern setting is logically explained within the story, and in fact it prompts one of the film's creepiest scenes, the one with voodoo princess ""Queen Zimba.""  Even though most of the cast is playing against type, they are proficient, particularly Louise Allbritton as Dracula's bride, and Robert Siodmak's direction is highly effective (even if he did have a perverse penchant for staging Dracula's scenes in front of mirrors, in which he is reflected).  As for Chaney, probably only Sofia Coppola in ""Godfather III"" has endured more abuse for a single performance, which is sadly ironic since ""Son of Dracula"" is one of his best Universal turns.  Really!  Throughout his career, Chaney managed to project a child-like, helpless quality that was an asset for roles such as Lennie or even Larry Talbot, and later ones, such as Robert Mitchum's father in ""Not As A Stranger,"" in which he was cast as a desperate alcoholic.  But here he abandons his child-like personna completely and plays the role with subtlety, iciness, masterful control and a real sense of knowing evil. Truth is, the only contractee on the Universal lot in 1943 who could have done the part as well or better was Basil Rathbone, who, given his low opinion of horror films, would probably rather have eaten worms.  ""Son of Dracula"" is not a great film, or a particularly important one, but it is nowhere's near the dog that tradition has made it out to be.  It's a highly entertaining shocker that shows off Chaney to far better effect than any of those ""Inner Sanctum"" mysteries that were made around the same time.  Try it -- you'll like it.",1116288000,3,2123,4.770491803278689
304171,3,6301005783,"With 1943's ""Son of Dracula"" the Dracula series officially became 'b"" movie fodder as most of Universals horrors of the 1940's were.  The movie opens with Count Alucard (Lon Chaney) coming to stay at the southern home of a wealthy and rather morbid heiress Katherine Caldwell (Louise Albritton) whom he met when she was in Hungary.  Katherine has become smitten with the Count and after he kills her father, she asks only to be given the home, while all the rest of the estate can go to her sister Claire (Evelyn Ankers).

Katherine slips away to a nearby swamp as the Count's coffin rises from the depths of the swamp and he emerges in a cloud of mist which was a very effective special effect in its day.  The two are married and Katherine breaks the news to her fiancee Frank.  Frank confronts them back at the house and tries to shoot the count, but the bullets simply pass through him, and kill Katherine who was standing behind.  Soon Professor Brewster realizes that Alucard is Really Count Dracula and contacts a Hungarian professor Laszlo for assistance to help destroy the vampire.

Son of Dracula does have some things going for it.  The additions to the vampire mythology of turning to mist is very effective and allows Dracula to sneak up on his enemies or to escape when Laszlo shows him a crucifix when Dracula tries to strangle Brewster.  The film also shows Dracula levitating across the swamp which one makes the guess was basically his mist form given shape.  Son doesn't have the gothic trappings of the original but the set pieces are still fairly effective.  And of course any movie with Evelyn Ankers is always a treat.

Unfortunately a major drawback is star Lon Chaney Jr.  While Chaney was fine playing the tortured Larry Talbot, Dracula is a role that requires much more charisma and presence, particularly sexual presence which Chaney was sorely lacking in.  He comes off much too stiff and monotone in delivering his lines and there's not a hint of Hungarian accent to him.

Also there is no ""Son"" at all here.  He proclaims himself as Dracula and while maybe this was intended to be more in title than literal, there was still no explanation on he being Dracula's son.  But then, Continuity was never much of an important factor to Univeral back in those days.

Certainly no classic, it is one of Universal's better B movies of the 1940's.  Call it 3 1/2 stars.",1111968000,,2391,4.663484486873508

304173,5,6301005783,"Universal's 1943 ""Son Of Dracula"" is a great contribution to it's stable of gothic horror films. Universal departed in several ways in the creation of this film. Firstly, the story is placed in a contemporary southern setting in the U.S., rather than in the non-descript ""euro setting"" of many of it's other gothic films. This film also features the first ""man to bat"" transformations that still hold up today. It also expands the vampire legend by adding to the film vampire's powers not only the ability to transform into bats or wolves, but also to a swirling mist, also visually well executed by the film's makers. An interesting controversy surrounds this film and most horror film buffs know what I am talking about. But believe me, despite traditional arguments to the contrary, as to whether the vampire of the title is actually Dracula or his son, the answer is actually left ultimately for the viewer to decide. In an exchange between vampire hunters Dr. Lazslo and Dr. Brewster, Count Alucard (Dracula spelled backwards),is described as being either Dracula himself or a ""descendent"" of Dracula- it is never actually determined which in the film it is. However, I believe most viewers, like myself, are satisfied that the vampire in question is indeed Dracula himself. The story line is completely orginal and well done in that it explores the relationship between human beings and the undead on an entirely new level with a human being ""willingly"" becoming a vampire in order to obtain eternal life- an interesting take on the Dracula formula, raising interesting questions about human existence, recalling ""Faust"".

Lon Chaney Jr.'s performance, despite what some critics have dismissed as a bad case of miscasting, in fact, brings a youthful power to the role that would later be improved upon by Christopher Lee in Hammer Film's 'Horror of Dracula"" in 1958. His Dracula is both cruel and powerful, and as is the case with many a vampire, he has a weakness for a beautiful neck. In this case that neck belongs to the wonderful Louise Allbritton, playing a victim who in her own way victimizes Dracula himself-but enough about the plot, lest I give it away. Son of Dracula is well worth seeing. It is a great example of Universal's second cycle of gothic horror films released during the 1940s. If you love vampires, you'll love ""Son of Dracula'. Highly recommended.",1095379200,4,2379,4.9475
304174,2,6301005783,"It's hard to imagine a more lackluster Dracula film than 1943's Son of Dracula.  The plot is pretty straightforward, but the whole premise is almost laughable.  The special effects, while campy by today's standards, would have been a plus had the film not relied on them far too heavily.  Only the strangely soothing voice of Frank Craven in the role of Dr. Brewster won me over, but his positive contributions are more than offset by Lon Chaney, Jr.'s incredibly boring performance.  The strange resemblance of Robert Paige to TV's Gomer Pyle offered me more excitement and food for thought than this movie ever did.
First off, the vampire in this film is not the son of Dracula; he is a Count Dracula, but his utter lack of presence and personality makes him nothing like the Count Dracula of Bram Stoker and Bela Lugosi fame.  Apparently, the Count has basically bled his Transylvania home region dry and has decided to seek fresh, new blood in America - Louisiana, to be exact.  His brilliant method of concealing his identity is to call himself Count Alucard (which any fool can see is Dracula spelled backward).  Having developed some sort of relationship with heiress Katherine Caldwell (Louise Allbritton), he journeys to her estate in Louisiana and promises to reward her devotion with the gift of eternal life.  Katherine's fianc&eacute; Frank Stanley (Robert Paige) naturally doesn't take these doings sitting down, and in his murderous hatred of the Count he ends up shooting Katherine (in his defense, he had no way of knowing that the bullets would travel through the Count's body without effect).  Dr. Brewton (Frank Craven) is the only person with suspicions as to the true identity of Count Alucard, and he calls in the assistance of the European Professor Lazslo (J. Edward Bromberg) .  The professor's main job in the film is to go around saying things such as Ha!  I could have told you that would happen!  Van Helsing, he isn't.
The film does introduce a couple of new vampire concepts, including a new means for killing a vampire.  Much more memorable, however, is the vampire's ability to take the form of a hazy mist, a power that allows Count Alucard easy access to his enemies.  The movie also goes out of its way to reveal the transformation of the vampire to and from its bat form - this is pretty cool the first couple of times but soon grows old.  The main problem with Son of Dracula, however, is (and some will disagree with me on this) Lon Chaney, Jr.  Count Alucard couldn't scare a flea off of a dog, much less strike fear or any other sort of emotion (besides unbearable boredom) in the hearts of viewers.  Sure, he sneaks up on his enemies a time or two in the form of a mist, but he does nothing but offer vague threats to those who would challenge him.  Even those bland threats are offered in a voice free of any sort of European accent (despite the fact Alucard has just come over from his Eastern European homeland).
It's hard to believe that the same writer who gave us the novel Donovan's Brain and the script for Universal's classic The Wolf Man could have produced such a limp story as this.  Perhaps he realized just how incapable Chaney was of playing a decent vampire and decided the extra effort to actually write a good story would not be worth the trouble.  This may not be the worst Dracula movie ever made, but it may well be the most painfully boring one.",1084665600,2,3410,4.642262895174709
304175,5,6301005783,"After having read countless scathing reviews of this film over the past twenty years, I finally decided to purchase ""Son of Dracula"" just to see how terrible it really was (I'm a classic horror movie freak, so I end up buying them all anyway, regardless of quality). I was quite surprised to discover that SOD is actually one of the best of the Universal cycle of monster flicks from the 30s and 40s, and one of the very few movies from this time period with a genuine air of chilling menace about it (""The Mummy"" and the original ""Frankenstein"" being two other stand out exceptions). Yes, I know this is a bold statement, but I stand by it after having watched SOD numerous times.

 No, Lon Chaney Jr. was not the best choice of actors for the role of Dracula (he is credited as ""Count Dracula"", not ""Alucard""...anyone who actually pays attention to the movie will discover that ""Alucard"" is a cover that Dracula is using while causing mischief in the deep south, and the ""Son"" part of the title derives from a misconception of the Doctor Lazlo character, who believes that Alucard is a descendent of the famous bloodsucker and not the vampire king himself). Anyway, back to Chaney's performance...as miscast as he was (in all of his ""beefy"", ""beer bloated"" glory), I still think he comes across as more DANGEROUS and more EVIL (and, in some ways, more lusting and sexual) than the quite frankly (forgive me) CORNY cliche of Bela Lugosi's interpretation of the character. Don't get me wrong, Chaney was definitely no Christopher Lee, but like Lee, he played his vampire character more in the vein of the original Stoker conception: he is a tough guy on a mission, with no regrets or guilt, no sense of inner torment over his condition (ala Gary Oldman in the 1992 Coppola version, and countless actors before and since)...he truly enjoys his exhalted position over the human cattle and has no qualms about killing them!

 The plot in a nutshell: a southern heiress with an interest in the occult (played by the gorgeous Louise Allbritton) eagerly awaits the arrival of the mysterious Count Alucard, a man she has previously met on a vacation in Budapest, Hungary. She is interested in Alucard because she believes (quite rightly) that he can aid her in her black magic pursuits. Despite her intense interest in ""Alucard"", she is actually in love with her childhood sweetheart, Frank. When Alucard's luggage shows up on a train (sans the Count), Kay is in a tizzy...where could he be? So she goes to an old gypsy witch in the swamp (Queen Zimba, the local fortune teller), who tells her that the Count will indeed arrive...and that this is not a good thing! After croaking some creepy dialog (see the title of this review), Zimba is literally scared to death by a huge bat.

 Meanwhile, the Count has already set up shop in a nearby swamp drainage tunnel (where he keeps his coffin), and he's been scoping out the town (he does away with Kay's rich old father, for reasons that make perfect sense later). The Count eventually hooks up with Kay in the swamp, and this meeting is the best scene in the film...Dracula's coffin surfaces in the swirling waters and oozes a fog that materializes in the form of the Count himself (who then rides the coffin to the shore to meet his woman). Kay is apparently under Dracula's spell, and they get married, making Dracula the defacto master of Dark Oaks Estate (a base from which he can suck the blood of the ""young and virile race"" of the Americans...his own homeland has been drained dry!). Kay's friends and family suspect that something is up, some of them think that she's insane, especially her lover, Frank (Robert Paige) and a prominent local businessman (played by Frank Craven), who also suspects that Alucard is something other than what he appears. Enter Doctor Lazlo (J. Edward Bromberg), a native Carpathian and vampire lore expert...

 Frank confronts Alucard, a fight ensues, Frank fires bullets into Alucard but they go right through him and end up killing Kay. Frank is jailed, but Kay mysteriously re-appears, apparently still ""alive""...and she has a plan: she does still indeed love Frank, and she has only been using Alucard to become immortal so that she can make Frank immortal also and be with him forever! Will he go along with it? Will Lazlo and company be able to save the day? Well, you'll just have to watch the damn movie!!!

 This film features many well known Universal actors (including ""scream queen"" Evelyn Ankers, although she doesn't scream once here), but the real stars of the picture are all of the beautifully creepy, mist-choked, and moss laden swamp sets. The man-to-bat transformation scenes were also quite impressive for 1943.

He is cold, ruthless, and delightfully sinister. It is these qualities that make a great Dracula. The only thing Chaney lacks is the gothic charm of Lugosi. The story is surprisingly complex as it moves along, generating genuine suspense and thrills. At first the plot is somewhat clunky, but quickly gets more and more interesting. The sets do the job quite well in setting the chilling mood. The acting was excellent.

His American slave is Kay Caldwell (Louise Albritton), a strange young woman obsessed with the occult and eternal existence. Dracula (Lon Chaney, Jr.) rises in an eerie mist from his coffin hidden beneath the water of the swampy slough, takes human form, and glides toward a transfixed Kay.

The lighting was well done to give the movie that eerie feeling all the way through. It was truly breath taking to see the coffin rise from the swamp as the mist comes from it and transforms into Count Alucard as he stands atop it while it goes toward the bank.
Lon Chaney Jr. did a good job portraying the Count. People who say he didn't make a good Dracula should realize that he didn't get enough meaty lines in the story. He doesn't make an appearance until well into the movie, and it is even longer before he gets any substantial dialogue. Therefore, blame the script writers for not giving him enough good material to establish himself solidly at the start of the movie.
The only other complaint I have is the ""Son"" in the title. No reference is made to this, so it is misleading. The closest they come to this is saying that he is a descendant of the Dracula bloodline.
Overall, a well done movie with suspense, good supporting actors and a great ending when we see Alucard's coffin burning and the sun rising.",980208000,9,1134,4.404761904761905
304193,2,6301005783,"""Son of Dracula"" (1943) has everything going for it, except the presence of Bela Lugosi. Instead, Universal Studios rejected the horror icon in favor of Lon Chaney Jr.  a major blunder that seriously damages a potentially fine film. Except for the Wolf Man, Chaney's limited talents were evident in his ineffectual portrayals of the Mummy and Frankenstein's monster. As Count Alucard/Dracula, Chaney lacks the charismatic evil and strong  presence that Lugosi brought to the role. Director Robert Siodmak has created a moody, atmospheric chiller set in the Deep South, yet his admirable efforts are all but ruined by Chaney's miscasting. It's a shame, because ""Son of Dracula"" was intended to be a cut above most of Universal's horror programmers.

7808881,4,6301005783,"This is the third in the authored series about Dracula based on the 1897 book by Bram Stoker. The first one that was done in 1922 was an unauthorized film which was supposedly destroyed, although attempts to restore it exist. The first authorized film starred Bela Lugosi in 1931. The first sequel was in 1936 and called Daughter of Dracula. Daughter was followed by this film in 1943, Son of Dracula. Since the 1943 version, over 170 films were made based in some ways upon Bram Stokers book.
In this film, Dracula comes to the US because his homeland is all dried up, mostly because of the activities of his father and him. He uses the reverse spelling of his name Count Alucard. He comes to the home of a woman who is the daughter of a rich man who owns a large luxurious home which he wants as his base. The woman had met him in his homeland and who was fascinated by him. She is in love with another man, but believes strongly in the occult and wants to use Alucard to gain eternal life, have her boyfriend kill him, and then the two can live together in peace for all eternity. Dracula kills the womans father so that she can inherit the house and he marries her.
Some movie critics found fault with Lon Chaney, Jr.s version of Dracula, mostly because he was not as sinister and evil acting and did not control humans as Bela Lugosi did. Lugosi made people do his will by hypnotizing them. Also, the use of the cross to stop Dracula is used very sparingly, just one or two times, although it was a strong presence in the Lugosi film and added drama there. I agree with this critique. I felt that one could characterize Lon Chaney Jr.s version as Dracula Light.",1506902400,2,1666,4.377419354838709

7808884,4,6301005783,"""Son Of Dracula"" with Lon Chaney is full of surprises-and yes, disappointments. To begin with although it's NOT his fault, Lon Chaney lacks the gravitas that Bela Lugosi or even our own late great Christopher Lee brought to the character of  Dracula- probably because they are European/British and Chaney is of course American( I think Lugosi was under contract to another studio at the time). The shifting of backdrop from not just Transylvania or even London to the bayou country of Louisiana( shades of Anne Rice's Lestat and Louis in ""The Vampire Chronicles""!) is an original touch( Dracula explains to his new bride, Katherine Caldwell,played by Louise Albritton, that his native land is dried out and dessicated after centuries of vampiric predation and so he has decided to seek fresher pastures in the New World).
 I especially liked the sequence in which Katherine (or ""Kay"" as her fiance Frank calls her) watches, Dracula's coffin rise from the depths of the bayou and a mist floats out of it, which reforms into her undead lover's body who then lets the coffin travel towards her until he reaches Kay and kisses her hands in the style of an old world nobleman.
Of all the characters in this film, Kay seems the most mysterious- and arguably the most tragic. A psychiatrist notes her preoccupation with the morbid and evident fear of dying- which he terms ""thanatophobia""- a phobia that is disproportionately associated with women
(although nobody really understands the reason why- even nowadays. It may very well be the case that as women are associated with the giving of life via childbirth, the prospect of dying is especially horrifying to them).
Another intriguing sequence is where Kay(now evidently a vampire) enters Frank's cell in the form of a bat and sucks some of his blood- not to kill him or even make him a vampire, but (I suspect) to create or reinforce a blood bond between them. She wants him to kill her""husband"" Dracula and so they can live forever as part of the ""Undead""( she pouts that they prefer this title to the one of ""vampire"" which they dislike apparently). ""Don;t you love me anymore?!"" she complains as she puts her arms around him and he notes how cold to the touch her body is- it should not be forgotten that like a zombie, a vampire- or ""undead"" as Kay puts it. is a reanimated corpse). Kay's heart may now be that of a vampire's but at the end of the day(or should i say ""night"") it is ultimately a woman's.

7808886,5,6301005783,"Son of Dracula is a little different because it takes us out of Transylvania and into the Louisiana bayou where the Count's son appears as ""Count Alucard""--and now you know where that name originated.

With a rather miscast Lon Chaney Jr as the title character--he's a little too heavyset and rough-featured to be considered nobility--it's different from the usual monster mix-up which follows in this series, though not as dark or chilling as Dracula's Daughter, with which it will undoubtedly always be compared. This one ended the Dracula familial association.

The story has many twist to keep it lively, or deadly. There's some voodoo to spice up things, and a heroine eager to taste the dark side of vampire romance. Instead of becoming the Count's unwilling victim, this lass runs eagerly into his arms. The script is above par for this type of film, showing some insights into psychology, especially in the ""dialogue"" between the rejected suitor and his supposedly murdered fiancee.

A bit of a different ending keeps it from falling into the usual set-up for a sequel so in the next movie the scriptwriters had to return to Europe and stay there. This also began the downward spiral into the monster mishmash to which the later movies fell prey. If the others had been written with as much thoughtfulness as this and its two predecessors, they truly might've become ""classics"" in every sense of the word.

People wait in a train station. Two men stand on a platform. There is a big box in the baggage car. They expect a visit from Count Alucard. An old woman gives a warning. A bat flutters in to end her talk. The Count shows up after nightfall. We see the party. A bat flies into the room. Kay talks to Frank Stanley. Frank tells that Count Alucard is unknown to the Hungarian Embassy. Colonel Caldwell died suddenly, two marks on his neck Doctor Harry Brewster asks about the Count and is warned. Caldwell left a new will, one daughter gets the land the other gets the money. [It would be better to split the estate, let one buy out the other.] Where is the Counts baggage? I don't like it. Dr. Brewster wants to protect Kay. Alucard rises from his coffin! Kay waits for him. They get married. Frank argues with Alucard and shoots his pistol, then runs off. A large bat follows him.

Frank arrives at Dr. Brewsters home to tell what happened. Is it a nightmare? Alucard places Kay in a box. Dr. Brewster looks for Kay at her home, then goes into the cellar. He finds Kay sitting in bed. She doesnt want any visits from her old friends. Say Goodbye to Frank. Judge Simmons visits Dr. Brewster. Frank says he killed Katherine! But they cant visit Kay until night. The Sheriff takes them to Dark Oaks. Frank doesnt remember much about last night. They look into the crypt! Professor Laszlo arrives with his Old World knowledge. Vampires are invulnerable at night, but can be destroyed during the day. Alucard suddenly appears from a cloud of smoke! A young boy is a victim. Frank awakes to see Kay in his jail cell! It cant be! Kay explains her actions. You have no choice. Kay asks him to destroy Dracula. [A romantic triangle?] They must find Alucards coffin to destroy him.

The jailer tells how Frank held a conversation with a woman in his cell. Miss Caldwell talks to Frank, Kay says Dr. Brewster and her sister Claire must be eliminated. Professor Laszlo recommends an immediate cremation for Kay. Frank escaped and went to find Alucards coffin to set it on fire. Without this refuge Alucard will be destroyed. Where is Frank? Back at the mansion Frank says farewell to Katherine. When a love dies smoke gets in your eyes is the appropriate epitaph. Lon Chaney plays a vampire that is as good as, but different from, the character played by Bela from Lugos. The ending suggests an end to the vampire series of this era. This did happen with the end of the war.

The historic Dracula lived in the late 15th century. [A contemporary of Richard III of England.] He was commended by the Pope of that day as the only European ruler who was never defeated by the Turkish Sultan Mehmet II. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 the Turks threatened Europe until the end of the 17th century, the 1683 siege of Vienna. They conquered Bulgaria and Romania until the Russo-Turkish War of 1837-1840 liberated these countries. During WW II the OPA ordered Hollywood to economize on lighting to save coal and oil. Many of these movies became known as film noir because of their dark tone. Vampire films are a special kind of murder mysteries, a serial murderer; this one also has a love triangle.",1437955200,,3213,4.544041450777202
