1920750,5,B0000D0YWU,It was a good movie the movie it self told the truth about the bible it self.,1284336000,2,77,3.588235294117647
1920795,1,B0000D0YWU,Worst movie ever. If this was how it happened bo one would have ever followed God.,1445558400,,82,4.1875
1920796,5,B0000D0YWU,This movie is awesome,1440633600,,21,4.5
1920797,1,B0000D0YWU,"It is stories like this that inspired the scripture ""Do Not Add or Delete anything from the Bible"" They took a bit of truth and wrote their own story!  Just hear the first few lines, and you will know they have no idea about the Holy Bible, and what God did in the beginning. Movie says God did not create water till sometime after man was created. and he is angry cause his tribe is thirsty.
  They applied todays attitudes to the Bible History to get a lot of Dribble from everyone's mouth!  Everyone is calling others bad names and acting like spoiled children!",1438128000,,564,4.394230769230769
1920798,5,B0000D0YWU,I enjoyed watching the African version of Genesis as opposed to the main stream version. The story was more believable and organic.,1436400000,,131,5.0
1920799,1,B0000D0YWU,"This movie appeared to be a mockery to such a beautiful story, not in line with the Bible.",1436140800,,90,4.055555555555555
1920800,3,B0000D0YWU,Hard to follow the story. Didn't know it was with English subtitles.,1435363200,,68,4.75
1920801,4,B0000D0YWU,"Strange Mirror to be looking into. This African version seems to be several biblical tellings woven together. A little Noah, A little bit of Cain and Able interlaced with Jacob and Esau, spliced in with the rape of Tamar (along with the subsequent  gruesome revenge). The choice of actors (to me) to be well done. Character actions are bigger than life... as are the moral tales they represent. The filming is excellent and vivid although it fell apart ( for me) at one point during what was probably a ""dream sequence"" the character was experiencing. It is somewhat difficult to follow due to the language barrier, and I'm not sure the translation really follows in English that well. All that being said, watching the tribal costuming, the interactions between tribal groups as the events might have happened IN THE TIME the tales HISTORICALLY took place- that was brilliant. Probably a film more for cinephiles, or, if you are looking for an eclectic sort of experience. Real spoiler... Esau is played by an albino actor. ( At least he appears to be very light eyed and a strange skin color) If you know anything regarding the view of albino people culturally in parts of Africa, symbolically that is a stunner. which leaves me with the thought that there probably is something missing, a deeper meaning not caught in translation. A mirror worth looking into if you have the time.",1434844800,,1383,4.810924369747899
1920802,5,B0000D0YWU,A very clear copy and absolutely a very beautiful story in the Scriptures of Genesis! I am 100% sure I can still pass this on to my children and grandchildren. They can still watch it over and over again with its very good condition. The Sub-title makes it very convenient to watch and fully understandable.,1434499200,,307,4.6
1920803,3,B0000D0YWU,"Interesting movie from an African perspective. I recommend that you first read the book of Genesis before viewing this English subtitled video in order to refresh or, perhaps, introduce you to the history it is portraying.",1425686400,,222,5.194444444444445
1920804,3,B0000D0YWU,"not according to scripture, and the bible, great that some one did it from an African American side, but it kinda strayed",1425081600,,121,4.545454545454546
1920835,5,B0000D0YWU,Close to what reality must have looked like.,1415059200,,44,4.625
1920836,4,B0000D0YWU,"I thought the movie was compelling and the truth was displayed nicely. Rebekah had 2 nations in her wound, Jacob the Israelite and Esau who became the race of the Caucasian people. All the ites in the new testament King James bible version were people of color. Black",1411171200,,267,4.583333333333333
1920837,5,B0000D0YWU,"I enjoyed their take on a familiar story.  It was brought to life through the background setting and clothes.  My only problem was that the subtitles were, at times, somewhat difficult to read because it blended into the background.",1410393600,,232,4.923076923076923
1920838,1,B0000D0YWU,Did not enjoy this movie.,1408752000,,25,4.2
1920839,4,B0000D0YWU,The language was impacting but this is another view......,1408233600,,57,5.444444444444445
1920840,3,B0000D0YWU,"I have never been good with biblical understanding, that said I go the gist of it and the ending somewhat... Ummm, I didn't care for the acting on a whole and didn't get the role of the crazy daughter at all. I appreciate the thoughts that went into the film however.",1407801600,,267,4.254901960784314
1920841,5,B0000D0YWU,I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was refreshing. Jacob story is one of the most compelling stories in the bible. Jesus Christ is Lord and He lives!!,1401926400,,154,4.535714285714286
1920842,3,B0000D0YWU,Not quite what I thought it would me.  Will have to refer back to the Bible.  It was interesting too watch.  Would recommend to friends too watch.,1399680000,,146,4.333333333333333
1920843,5,B0000D0YWU,The REAL story of how it went down in the Bible days: the version you will NEVER see on TV. Beautiful story...I just wished the producer made more movies that were Bible based.,1394323200,,176,4.363636363636363
1920844,1,B0000D0YWU,I didn't realize it was subtitled ( I don't care for reading my story) I can read a book if I want to do that. I Also thought it was a bible story. It just wasn't what I expected.,1393372800,,179,3.6153846153846154
1920855,2,B0000D0YWU,Interesting but slow and poor acting. I did like the setting tho. Also being on sub titles is not my favorite thing.,1390003200,,116,4.318181818181818
1920856,1,B0000D0YWU,Poor acting and script was poorly done not a good film not worth spending the time watching forget it no good,1388534400,,109,4.238095238095238
1920857,3,B0000D0YWU,Interesting adaptation of this story told from the view of another culture. Slow moving and at times hard for me to keep focused on. Great camera work.,1379808000,2,151,4.62962962962963
1920858,4,B0000D0YWU,"It was very interesting to see it from this African viewpoint. They did very well, except that they did not keep with the order of scripture very closely making the story confusing. They also have a dark view of God, which meant He didn't seem to receive the glory like He should have through the story.",1364515200,3,303,4.428571428571429
1920859,1,B0000D0YWU,"I didn't get it, it seemed that something was missing, but I just didn't know what it was, hopefully other people might get it!?!?!",1364169600,,131,4.5
1920860,4,B0000D0YWU,"Every so often I select a movie on my Kindle by swiping to spin, closing my eyes and tapping the screen.  This is how I selected Genesis. I appreciated the telling of the account of Jacob and Esau, but especially of Dinah became her story is often skimmed over in Bible studies. I would've given 5 stars but the color of the subtitles made them very hard to read.",1362873600,3,363,4.260869565217392
1920861,4,B0000D0YWU,This is much closer like what is written in the bible then what is told and portrayed by society. Thanks for the truth!,1362009600,,119,4.217391304347826
1920862,2,B0000D0YWU,The quality of this movie was very poor. So poor that it could not be viewed and the subtitles were very hard to read.,1357776000,,118,3.9583333333333335
1920863,5,B0000D0YWU,"This movie was beautifully done in its natural heritage; I am thankful to whom ever did it, truly you were God inspired. I first thought I wished it was in english and then realize in its natural language is the only acceptable language for the message to stand strong.

I pray the God of heaven will allow you to continue to give His word through His true people!

If you want to see the Genesis story parallel to the Bible, this is a must see!!!

I will be buying this...

God bless you for this production.",1350086400,5,509,4.270833333333333
1920864,5,B0000D0YWU,"If you have come into the knowledge that the children of Israel were all black people including Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, this would be a great video for you to have in your collection!

This movie is base on the lost of Joseph and the rape of Dinah, Jacobs daughter ALSO shows that Esau was red skin (white)!

This video is in the Bambara language with English subtitles",1318377600,5,371,4.4411764705882355
7999954,5,B0000D0YWU,A new and fresh perspective on Genesis,1494547200,,38,4.571428571428571
7999955,3,B0000D0YWU,Kinda a weriod movie.,1464393600,,21,4.5
7999956,4,B0000D0YWU,Though I love that the people used to act as the patriarchs of Israel and the rest of the indigenous people of that area and era... they didn't stick to the scripture when telling the story of Jacob and his family... Therefore it's 4 stars... lovely movie nevertheless...,1464393600,,271,4.666666666666667
7999957,5,B0000D0YWU,I did not expect that the movie in my language Manding. It is a great movie. I love it,1461974400,,86,3.5789473684210527
7999958,4,B0000D0YWU,Unfortunately it's all great but what can I say if I gave you five stars you would say that you don't need any improvement and we all need a little improvement,1461715200,,159,4.161290322580645
7999959,5,B0000D0YWU,"Very interesting, my wife likes",1461715200,,31,5.4
7999960,1,B0000D0YWU,"I found it not to follow the Bible correctly, plus it was subtitled-- I have enjoyed subtitled movies in the past but not this one, the lettering was in a pale color which was very hard to read against the background, and frankly the acting was poor--we cut it off before the movie ended.",1457568000,,288,4.351851851851852
7999961,1,B0000D0YWU,"Horrible,  not biblically based, added to bible.  It's wonderful that they want to share the gospel but they have changed what scripture says using creative expression can be dangerous.  Galatians 1:6-9 and Revelation 22:18-19 come to mind.",1457308800,,240,5.4324324324324325
7999962,5,B0000D0YWU,Just lovely this is the truest that this story has been told,1456531200,,60,4.083333333333333
7999963,1,B0000D0YWU,"Account seemed quite different than the Bible.  Actually, only watched a small portion of it.",1445558400,,93,5.2
