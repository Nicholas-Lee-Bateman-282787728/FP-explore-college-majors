8216094,3,B000V0CXPY,My 3yr old really likes watching this dvd but the moves are too advanced for her. She doesn't really seem to get into it either....probably more suitable for a 5-8 yr old. Its definitely overpriced for what it is.,1515283200,,213,4.487179487179487

8216100,5,B000V0CXPY,"she's mesmerized by Bella... mesmerized by video everyone time she watches it.  Great purchase, worth the money... Daughter laughs while she's watching it.",1374883200,2,155,5.739130434782608
8216101,5,B000V0CXPY,"I think the Bella Dancerella series is sort of odd and almost ridiculous but my 5 year old twin granddaughters absolutely LOVE it!! They are entertained for hours by these dvds... and they don't just sit watching, they actually get up and do all the steps, seriously attempting to learn everything Miss Bella is teaching.  I would recommend this for all parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles... a great gift for small girls!!",1360627200,5,427,4.930555555555555
8216102,5,B000V0CXPY,My little 4 year old who loves to play dance wore her last one out and this is her second DVD...  A true must have for any little girl that loves to dance. Seller did a wonderful job as well. I highly recomend all the way around.,1337817600,4,229,3.872340425531915
8216103,5,B000V0CXPY,My daughter got this when she was 2 1/2 and loved it then but she loves it even more now that she is 4.  Sure she doesn't learn the whole routine or keep up with all the moves but boy does she try and loves every second of it.  It has given her confidence in dancing and I would highly recommend it if your child has an interest in dance!!,1289088000,9,339,3.8285714285714287
