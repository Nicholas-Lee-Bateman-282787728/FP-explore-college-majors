4209411,5,B003VJTGNE,"Still aired on tv today, Tales From The Darkside has surprised everyone by standing the test of time.
Playing out more like an 80's version of The Twilight Zone, Tales offers a wide variation of stories that include horror, science fiction and dark comedy (But no worries horror fans I'd say it's 75 percent straight horror) and every season is well worth owning.
Now I plan on reviewing the seasons as well but right now I'll focus on the complete series set :) .
A few important things about it
1. It's just the 4 individual season sets wrapped together
A. Now I like this! Some may want an extra box with goodies but this is a cheap way to have the whole collection! Do you really want to add each one to your cart slowly? This is simple!
2. There are 90 episodes in total
3. Each season is excellent and has plenty of classics. Having the whole series at once gives you a chance to jump around season to season and create your own viewing order :)

Overall I'm thrilled I decided to just to complete my collection at once. It's a good deal and it's a great series.
Buy it!",1329004800,9,1076,4.300492610837439
4209412,4,B003VJTGNE,"This is an excellent horror/sci-fi/drama anthology series from the 80's! Each half-hour tale had a strange twist! The great news is that it wasn't scary as much as it was interesting and relatively suspenseful. There is; however, one negative and that is that Paramount changed the music in some of the epsiodes due to licensing reasons. They should re-release the entire series in its original format with all original music.",1324339200,8,426,5.1
4209413,1,B003VJTGNE,"how the hell it is possible that this great show does not have a choice of subtitles or languages? Paramount is the only study that does not add to their shows these options, I remind you gentlemen, that in the United States, the second most spoken language is Spanish, followed by French, Thai, Korean, Portuguese and so on. So, what is your excuse?. In an increasingly globalized world Paramount shows an incredible xenophobia, and definitely disturbing. I love this show, and I speak and understand English, however i will not buy it, and I recommend anyone who does not have English as their mother tongue do not buy it. Enough to discrimination against non-English speakers.",1311984000,13,679,4.913043478260869
4209414,5,B003VJTGNE,"This show is great, a lot darker than Tales From the Crypt. And id just like to clarify that I love that show too. But Darkside always seemed to be a little more daring, almost as if they felt like they had more to prove, and Crypt just had to be the unreachable commercial bar. They are both fantastic examples of the genre, but secretly, I will chose Darkside, every time. From the almost ""purposely"" crappy intro, to the credits, Tales From the Darkside will kick your ass. Check out one of my many favorite episodes, ""Halloween Candy""",1309824000,36,538,4.5
4209415,5,B003VJTGNE,"If you were a child of the 1980's and loved horror films, or shows, then it's more than likely you watched Tales From The Darkisde at one time or another. I loved it.
I never forgot Paul Sparrer's chilling introduction. While some episodes are better than others, and many episodes are forgettable, anyone who watched this in the 80's probably never forgot the intro.

Years ago I had hoped they would, eventually, release the seasons on DVD. When they did, needless to say, I was excited.
So many great memories, and great episodes that I remember, like the pilot ""Trick Or Treat"", ""Inside The Closet"", ""Halloween Candy"", ""Payment Overdue"", ""Seasons of Belief"" and my personal favorite, ""The Cutty Black Sow""
This DVD set contains all 90 episodes. Everyone of them with Sparrer's intro and outro.

The only thing I would have liked to have seen were more extras. Maybe interviews with guys like George Romero, or Tom Savini who directed episodes in the series.

Still, this is an amazing compilation, and anyone who grew up with this show should add it to their collection.
I watch these epsiodes and I'm 10 years old again. I LOVE it and I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed this show in the 1980's.",1296432000,120,1205,4.728571428571429
4209416,4,B003VJTGNE,"I have not watched all of them but they appear to be of good quality.  Don't get fooled by ""complete series pack"" which usually indicates a DVD box set. This IS NOT a DVD box set in that what you get is the individual series DVDs that you can purchase seperately. The picture and title are misleading, making you think you are getting something special. A good price considering they are 30 dollars individually though.  I was very disappointed in the packaging and product description. One of the greatest shows of its kind next to the Twilight Zone, so if you were a fan of the show, it is a good buy to have an official copy of them all.",1292889600,53,640,4.325

4209432,5,B003VJTGNE,This show didn't air in my market when I was a kid but I wish it did!! It's been a blast watching it. Sure it's a little cheesy but you should expect that going into it. Very enjoyable to watch. I was really happy to see Word Processor of the Gods in the collection and happier to see how closely it stuck to the original story. Great collection!,1503360000,2,346,4.102941176470588
4209433,5,B003VJTGNE,"Remember when this came out in 84 I was a 12 yr old, it came on somewhere around 10-11pm. The opening music was a blanket puller when I was a youngin. These range from good to great stories and the acting is pretty good, it brings back the memories of a decade that was in my lifetime the best of all! The picture and sound are good definitely better than on my 80s tv and analog broadcasting. Now that the master of zombies and some pretty da#n good horror is gone, RIP George Romero, I can enjoy part  what brought me to love him! Tales from the Dark Side was a highlight of the era along with the reruns of b&w twighlight zones and with the one that was on at the time and reruns of Night Gallery, and the Outer limits, these where what we watched before streaming and DVDs and before cable was in a large amount of homes. If your from the era you know and if your not but enjoy the 80s and Romero and like content you'll enjoy these.",1503100800,,937,4.092391304347826

4209443,3,B003VJTGNE,"Like the other reviews have stated, the disc cases came in scattered all over the box but in great condition. The box set case was destroyed though.

I chose to purchase this set because I have always been obsessed with The Twilight Zone and after some research, decided this series would be great to try. I'm still on the fence about it..

I watched through the first 2.5 discs in just a few days hoping that the next episode would be better then the last buuut 7 out of 10 times I was disappointed. I would not say this series as a whole is really that worthy of being put into the same category as The Twilight Zone but a few specific episodes are very reminiscent of TZ.",1499644800,3,674,4.2578125
4209444,4,B003VJTGNE,"I've been a huge fan of George Romero for years. I knew he had produced this show, but had really only given it a passing glance. One reason being the film, which I've always found underwhelming, and another being that it has always seemed like a ""tame"" version of ""Tales from the Crypt"". It is a very different style, however. These are pretty straightforward strange/horror stories, whereas ""Crypt"" always tried to keep an element of the comic books and often contained overtones of comedy. These stories are much more of the ""Twilight Zone"" type. While Romero was only directly involved in writing a small handful of episodes (including the so-so pilot, which he wrote and provides commentary for on the DVD) I think there are plenty of other interesting names involved. A few episodes written by Stephen King, and directors like Tom Savini and Jodie Foster. Plenty of recognizable actors, as well.
  For the money, I very much enjoyed watching these. Yes, the packaging is terrible as it often is these days, but...i wouldnt let that stop me. I spent a long time never paying any attention to this series, and I should have. It's worth a look.",1499472000,,1147,4.787878787878788

4209448,1,B003VJTGNE,"5 stars for the tv show itself - a classic 80s horror series that ranks amongst the best all-time horror shows.

1 star though for this edition - the transfer quality is very poor; I don't expect ultra 4k Blu-ray quality but this is like watching a low-quality VHS recording of an antenna signal.  Also, the packaging is also very poor, in that the discs are stacked two deep on each side of the plastic holders, so the top/shallow DVD fell off each row, and two of my discs are so scratched they won't even play.  My mistake for not checking the discs before the return window closed, but consider yourself warned.",1497139200,,615,4.473214285714286

Returned my first order because two discs were lose inside with scrached, also the sleeve holding all the discs came out of case. Order number two also had two discs loose but no scrached, also sleeve comes out. I don't like how the sleeve holding all the DVDs comes out of the case. Seems like if someone isn't careful they could all just fall out & damage the discs. Provided a picture of sleeve outside of case.",1493596800,15,584,4.518867924528302

4209457,4,B003VJTGNE,"These are transferred from video masters so they don't look too good.  One disc was loose in the case and marked but I waxed it.  This was billed as Creepshow the tv series, that being my favorite movie I needed to buy this.  Several are directed and scored by John Harrison and one by his partner Dusty Nelson even employs the trademark red/blue creepshow lighting!  The Tom Savini episodes are the best (In the closet and Halloween Candy).  I think the Capitol library music was only replaced on season 1 (except for In the Closet episode).  The rest were scored by the person listed in the credits.  The replacement music doesn't sound out of place.",1490659200,4,652,4.6173913043478265
4209458,5,B003VJTGNE,"I'm a simple chick. I'm not savvy on the transfer of information from video to DVD as some other reviewers believe they are and take two paragraphs to tell us how it's supposed to be done. Nor do I try to read into the ""true meanings"" or ""motivations"" behind the episodes and ruin it for some people as the armchair psychiatric reviewers do. NOR do I have a problem with one or two of the discs being loose from their moorings because it's a common occurrence and doesn't affect the discs. I just wanna be entertained and today's t.v. rots, plain and simple. This is a brand new boxed set, paid 25 bucks and change.

Any poor picture quality you see is because CBS used the original video transfer from the mid 80's (1 inch reel to reel video possibly, or Beta SP.). I've read several reviews on here and the internet offering the excuse that the poor quality is because it was shot on video. It was not.

CBS went the cheapest route possible No color correction, nothing.

4209492,5,B003VJTGNE,"You may wish to buy this package of all 4 seasons while they are still on the marketplace.  George A. Romero & Richard P. Rubenstein were the primary creators of this terrific horror anthology.  They previously collaborated, with Dario Argentp, to launch the modern zombie film with 1978's DAWN OF THE DEAD (not to be confused with the much inferior ""remake"" bearing the same title).  Each TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE is played for sheer terror.  The plotting ranges from causation-based (that is, given just one assumption, only mayhem can result) to atmospheric (subjective horror in the vein of Roman Polanski's REPULSION).
  That the half-hour episodes have this depth of range was and is unusual for a TV series.  Only the very best of the original 1959-1964 TWILIGHT ZONE programs approached the scares of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE.  Each DVD plays well--each is a quality DVD.  The only drawback is that, unlike years ago when the collection first became available, the 4 seasons are not in a baxed set.  They ""banded"" together.  .",1476144000,,1032,4.941860465116279

4209496,5,B003VJTGNE,"On packaging, I am uploading several pictures to note exactly how the packaging appears. Basically, this set has a clam shell design with a slipcover overlay. The slipcover is what you see in the images provided, and the clam shell has all seasonal names provided inside.

NOTE: The DVDs are NOT attached, so be careful how you open it.

As far as menu design, this is as rudimentary as you can get. You do have the option of previews and a disc menu, and menu sends you to all titles. You can choose 'play all' or singular play. I have NOT watched the previews and am not sadist enough to put myself and others through it.

The quality is a DVD standard, which is not bad. In fact, I was pretty happy with it. Now, it has not gotten some in-depth cleaning or anything of that nature, mind you, and I wish it would have. Still, having the whole series in one place is nice, too, and the set (currently at less that 30 dollars) is a good deal.

Details from packaging: 12 disc set, 1983 - 1988, Subtitles: English SDH (Season 4 ONLY), 4:3 Aspect Ratio.

On Tales From the Darkside, the show is a stellar 1980s showcase-type series, with some awesome Twilight Zone/Friday the 13th The Series/Monsters/others kind of feel to it. You have outmoded ideas in some, a feel for how technology was seen at the time, creature effects, cheesiness, and so much more there. I always love that window on a different time, and I always like seeing how we viewed personal computers as some dfficult-to-understand, curative for all ills, for example. You also have a lot of great people assembled here - as an example here, the Inside the Closet episode in Season 1 always stuck with me, and it is one you can preview online. It touts Tom Savini, and showcases some of what is here, although this is a better episode in that first batch, so do not expect this type of creature use, etc. There are a lot of faces you will recognize and a lot of people that worked in horror as well as in other genres.",1474761600,50,1983,4.407103825136612
4209497,4,B003VJTGNE,"Absolutely no effort was done to clean up image quality or sound. In fact, the picture seemed a little better when watching on Chiller cable station years ago. As this is one of only 2 TV shows I ever loved to watch over and over I would have been happy paying $50 more to get the image and sound cleaned up.
But the show is perfect. No need to knock off more than 1 star when you love what you're watching no matter how disappointing the picture looks at times.",1474761600,7,462,4.144444444444445

'Twilight Zone' and 'Monsters' will like this.

4209501,4,B003VJTGNE,"Bought mine at Walmart today.  As the review of RogueKnite I can confirm that discs are packaged in a shell with a twelve hub system, with one disc layered over one other disc and the hub is not anchored to shell. My Walker, Texas Ranger Complete Series set is exactly the same. I can't say for certain that this is horrible packing because between both sets I do not have one damaged disc. The hubs are a little tight in this set and being too rough may cause a disc to snap in half, so be gentle when snapping a disc out of a hub. I would much prefer packaging that does have a hub system anchored to the shell. There would have been no issue in breaking the set down into two volumes with each volume containing six discs; six-disc cases exist withe no need for for a more than a one double sided flip page for one disc per side.",1473811200,11,832,4.135802469135802

I can only comment on this seller and the dvds I received since I've read there are some questionable copies being sold on Amazon and I had to decide which to buy. I'm glad I bought this set. First, I received 4 individually shrink-wrapped plastic dvd cases (The First Season, The Second Season, The Third Season, The Final Season) which were then bundled together and shrink-wrapped with a red-lettered white sticker ""The Ultimate Terror Collection, The Complete Series, Own All 4 Seasons #11112017164).

4209529,4,B003VJTGNE,"Seized suddenly by 80's nostalgia, I purchased the complete sets of Tales From the Darkside and Monsters; both series were produced by Richard P. Rubinstein.  It bears stating again that this was the golden age of horror anthologies, and that along with a few truly inspired gems, there are sprinkled throughout some mediocre tales, and a few others that one truly just needs to pass on. (For example-there are simply too many cliched appearances by a certain fallen angel.)  As previously noted with Monsters, Tales is not holding up as well as I hoped or remembered; there have just been so many innovations with special effects, that most of the low-budget props, make-up and sets, while adding to the inherent 80's charm, detract from the story-line and overall impact of the inevitable ""twist"" at the end.  The presentations often feel like a staged play; they are dimly lit, isolated interiors with fake backdrops. Frequent famous guest star appearances (actors the caliber of Jean Marsh, for example) keep many of the stories lively, and there are a few character actors that one can't help but wonder what happened to, as they seemed to hold a lot of promise. I appreciated the influence and input of George Romero and Tom Savini, and will always love the creature from ""Inside the Closet.""  (Speaking of the darkside, there are some glaring sexist stereotypes and mores here that I had forgotten were still so prevalent during that era that made some of the reviewing less enjoyable for me.)  Still, it's important to keep in perspective that this was a landmark series for its time, and in many ways, had more innovation and integrity than much of similarly themed television that has followed since. In summary, and put in perspective of the era in which it emerged, Tales is certainly worth a look, and certain tales are worth revisiting time and again.",1441670400,,1865,4.889240506329114

Tales From The Darkside had a special creepiness because you could identify so closely with the characters and or the situations encountered.  This type of series lives or dies based on how successful they are at hiding the payoff plot reveal till the last second.  Tales From The Darkside generally did a very good job hiding its creepy endings because they were all slightly off beat, just off beat enough that you could not guess the whole thing. Tales From The Darkside made the horror just a bit too personal so when the character got a shock you felt in on some level too.  When you saw something icky on Tales From The Darkside the ewwwwwe you felt was both personal and visceral. There is nothing better than a good shiver inducing heart quickening fright and Tales From The Darkside gives those with alarming freuqency if allowed.",1435190400,4,969,4.622093023255814

4209548,4,B003VJTGNE,"This box set brings back the nostalgia from watching the series long before ""Chiller"" and ""Sci-Fi"" channels came along. Given the fact that this series was shot around 30 years ago the video quality is pretty bad, even knowing that the tv show didn't have any of the big box office budgets like other shows from this era its still pretty crappy video quality. The packaging is not that great also, whats annoying is that in each of the cases has a DVD divider and holder that will absolutely not hold in place. So the middle part just moves around when the case is closed. Every single DVD holder has some kind of broken plastic on it.

I'm surprised that there wasn't any extra effort to have some kind of video remastering done on it to enhance the picture quality. But then again I'm not surprised to know that the production company cheaped out by not even giving us the ""original"" network version of each episode. This was done by stripping almost every episode of its original music score and replacing it with another. So with this in mind you are not getting the same tv show as what was originally intended. I feel a little ripped off knowing this.

Given all these facts of cheap packaging, stripped soundtrack of episodes, and poor video reproduction the cost for the series should be less that what is asked for on a 4 season 30 year old television show.",1424044800,,1366,4.526315789473684

4209569,4,B003VJTGNE,"Received my set today in the mail and pretty pleased with what I paid. I'v had this in my wish list for some time watching the price go from $40-$50. It dropped one day to $33.00. Had to snag it as that is a great price for the complete seasons. The only weird thing, and I say weird because this is the 1st box set I'v bought that has come like this, is its not in a box but just the individual seasons shrink-wrapped together. I have seen this set in stores before and it did have a box with it. The shrink wrap around the 4 seasons doesn't looked like it was done at the factory either. It looks crappy like when something is opened and rewrapped. However, the individual seasons still have the original plastic so no big deal. I can tell you this is not a on demand set as one reviewer claims. These are direct from the manufacturer in standard cases. Other then shrink wrapping all the seasons together, it's all good.",1412899200,2,923,4.25

4209599,2,B003VJTGNE,"It's easy to want to categorize a series like this with the Twilight Zone, since they were half-hour vignettes of tales of the macabre but let's be honest: Tales from the Darkside was really, really poorly done. I remember watching the episodes when I was growing up and it's an interesting trip down memory lane but not a good one, particularly.

The writing is abysmal on many of these episodes, to be quite honest. Not even Stephen King or George Romero could help this stinker of a series. The punch line is that some episodes are credited to as many as three writers for a plot that could've been improved by letting the typical high school creative writing student take a swipe at it.

The Twilight Zone was an amazing collection of incredibly well told stories with actors of the same caliber. They were able to do on a small budget what Tales from the Darkside failed at: To simply tell spooky, smart stories in that half-hour time slot and to make them unforgettable. Twilight Zone (with Rod Serling) crafted a true art form with their formula. The Tales from the Darkside formula is trite and, at times, downright laughable. Some of these episodes make Ed Wood look like Orson Welles.

I know the series is sometimes a victim of the time period in which it was written; but that also makes it so forgettable whereas the Twilight Zone series proved to be timeless indeed. What seemed to start off with potential with the first episode quickly boils down to a lowest common denominator of ideas and concepts: spooky clowns, goofy aliens, possessed office equipment. You get the picture. And were it not for the title of the series as well as the introduction, which leads us to believe that it's ""spooky"" and ""dark"" (it never is) maybe it would be fine but the title is inappropriate given how much bad humor is used throughout all of the episodes. There's nothing dark or spooky about TFTD. And, again, I realize they had a small budget but it's painfully obvious how small it was when you look at the special effects and costumes.

It just falls really, really short overall and, as mentioned, doesn't withstand the test of time, unfortunately. Bad writing, horrible acting, laughable sets and special effects. Two of the episodes I couldn't even sit through and I can watch anything. I'm often accused of having too much interest in boring, long films but even these little snippets couldn't hold my attention in a few cases.

On the plus, side, the packaging (though not all packaged together as mentioned many times) is actually decent. The DVDs are held by the soft plastic cases where you can get the DVD out easily without any damage. No special features to write home about but given the quality of the series, that's probably a good thing. I can't imagine how in-depth you'd want to get with these plots.

The Twilight Zone featured some of the best actors of our time; TFTD features people you've never heard of and never heard from again, which speaks volumes about what kind of calibre of product they ended up with, sadly.

And maybe it's not fair to put TFTD against Twilight Zone but I think since Twilight Zone perfected and mastered the genre that TFTD was trying to attract, they inevitably step into the ring with them. And I think fans of the Twilight Zone are always looking for similar type shows but that's simply never happened since. So unless you're a fan of 80s kitsch and enjoying something when it's so bad it's laughable...skip this. You've been warned.",1393718400,9,3492,4.68678629690049

Season 2 container was broken, but I opted to keep the discs and put them in better containers.
5 stars for the short movies which are creepy and funny and eerie and all have a moral to the story if you listen.
2 stars for the packaging, which should average to a 3 and 1/2, but couldn't get the little stars to co operate. If you liked Tales From the Darkside, it is well worth the money. But don't expect it to be a ""set"" and don't expect good packaging.",1381708800,4,730,4.111888111888112

I was also disappointed as others mentioned at the lack of extra's and the lack of a box or display case or even a booklet for this set, you just get the 4seasons loose as you would buying them individually.

To me peeking over the top of those plush cushions let me know how good it was to be alive and ""Tales from the Darkside"" along with various other stories bizarre in character were portals into that human condition where dread is something fantastic rather than real. Regardless the horror still haunts! Truly this is a must see for any blood thirsty fanatic, but to compare ""Tales from the Darkside"" to ""Tales from the Crypt"" is like comparing peas and carrots. Oh Lord! Not ""Peas and Carrots""! The Horror! LOL! You see they were both from two completely different decades, both pushing the envelope, both with different network and societal liberties. In fact the majority of ""Tales from the Crypt"" came from a completely different genre altogether.

Gains), the Darkside gives us a more supernatural aspect conjured up by some of the darkest minds of today. Contributing minds such as Tobey Hooper, Stephen King, Clive Barker and George A. Romero set ""Tales from the Darkside"" apart from any other TV series during a time when ""The Wall"" was still up and ""Russia"" had it's nukes pointed in my backyard. Don't get me wrong though! I still enjoy that cackle bellowing out from that shrivelled up corpes with those big bulging blue eyes. The Cryptkeeper's just as fun, but in my opinion different in many ways. I hope this was helpful in someway. If you like ""Tales from the Darkside"" (****) and ""Tales from the Crypt"" (****) you might also enjoy these:

8406872,2,B003VJTGNE,"Let's be honest - most of the positive reviews here are coasting by on rose-tinted nostalgia, rather than objective truth.  If ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" are the *gold standard* for television anthology series, against which all other series should be judged (and they are), then ""Tales From The Darkside"" is... brass.  The faults are everywhere - the acting and dialogue is uniformly stilted, the direction is clumsy, the special effects are shoddy, the writing is hit-and-miss, weighted toward the latter end, with some stories completely lacking an inner logic, and the tone of the series is wildly uneven.  Moreover, the DVD's look terrible; the series was shot on tape, not film, so everything is dull and flat, and every episode looks grainy and compressed - with eight half-hour episodes crammed onto each dual-layer disc.  There's small pleasures to be found here, but let's not elevate this mediocre series into something it's not.",1518739200,,965,5.2064516129032254
