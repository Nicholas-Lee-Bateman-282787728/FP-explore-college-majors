335271,5,6301589068,"Esta pelcula fue filmada por el director Australiano John Lawless Duigan.  l naci en Inglaterra en 1949 pero se mud a Australia en 1961 para vivir junto a su padre australiano.  A l le gusta mucho dirigir pelculas sobre los jvenes y sus confusiones durante esa etapa de vida.  Tambin le gusta dirigir pelculas sobre diferentes culturas y la poltica de algunos pases.  l ha filmado varias pelculas pero algunas que son bien conocidas son ""Sirens"" en 1994, ""Flirting"" en 1991, ""The Year My Voice Broke"" en 1987 y ""Trespassers"" en 1976.  Sus ltimas dos pelculas son ""Paranoid"" en 2000 y ""Molly"" en 1999.  No solamente es director de pelculas sino tambin es escritor, productor y actor de filmografa.  John Duigan es ms conocido en otros pases que en los Estados Unidos porque ha sido el director de una sola pelcula estadounidense ""Romero"" en 1989 pero como quiera ha sido reconocido como un buen director de filmografa.  La pelcula ""Romero"" est basada en la vida real del arzobispo Oscar Romero de El Salvador quien sufri una transformacin de carcter cuando se dio cuenta de la opresin social de la mayora de las personas viviendo en su pas.  La opresin que estaba ocurriendo era por la mayor parte de la oligarqua quienes tenan poder sobre la mayora del pueblo salvadoreo.  Romero (Ral Julia) siendo ""amigo"" de la oligarqua no se haba dado cuenta de la opresin que estaba ocurriendo hasta que tom su puesto de arzobispo y despus del asesinato de su mejor amigo el padre Rutillo Grande (Richard Jordan).  Despus de que el arzobispo Romero se dio cuenta de lo que estaba pasando l decidi empezar una concientizacin en el pueblo salvadoreo por medio de la teologa de la liberacin.  Esta teologa ayud al pueblo a ver que en sus vidas no tenan que sufrir, que Cristo es parte de todos, los pobres no tenan que vivir reprimidos, que cada quien tena que hacer algo para combatir su opresin, y tambin que los pobres y ricos tenan los mismos derechos en decidir cmo vivir su vida.  El arzobispo Romero fue asesinado en 1980 por militares porque el se haba convertido en una persona que demandaba la paz en su pas, luchaba por los derechos de los pobres, y quien se haba involucrado polticamente contra el gobierno salvadoreo.  Sus esfuerzos ayudaron a traer una concientizacin en su pueblo pero su pas no ha podido cambiar el gobierno militar que todava existe en El Salvador.  Esta pelcula me encant pero es muy lamentable que no haba podido atraer la atencin del mundo.  El contenido de la pelcula fue un poco grfico pero ayud a que la audiencia sintiera todos los problemas que estaban pasando en El Salvador.  Fue muy triste saber que el arzobispo Romero haba sido asesinado por una causa tan noble y humanista para salvar a su pueblo.  Recomiendo esta pelcula a todas las personas del mundo para que se den cuenta de las cosas que pasan en otros pases por medio de la mala poltica que existe en algunos pases.",988416000,,2904,4.649706457925636
335272,4,6301589068,"Oscar Arnulfo romero,reluctant martyr and hero will one day be officially canonized a saint. In much of central and Latin America he is monsingnor romero,the one and only true hero that el salvador has ever known. This movie produced by the late lamented Fr. Ellwood keiser{known as the hollywood priest  for his ability to get big name stars to work for scale},was under obvious budget constraints. This might be the most catholic movie I have ever seen,though many would not view it as such. It tells the story of Romero, a quiet bishop, who, as a compromise,is elevated to be archbishop of San Salvador{the equivalant of cardinal of new york 50 years ago]. The eight familes{the name given to the oligarchy that ran[runs] the country} celebrated. here was  a man they could manipulate,who would bless the armed forces,condemn the ""radical elements$Q,and restore the status quo. All was well save for one thing:Romero changed. His friend{and ""radical element""}  fr Rutillio Grande{wwonderfully played by the late Richard Jordan}was asassinated along with a poor farmer and a young boy. From then on,and early in this movie, Romero becomes transformed. All seven sacraments are portrayed in this film{trivia,perhaps, though they work seamlessly} Romero trudges foward,though it becomes apparent to all what his ending will be. Raul Julia is simply wonderful as Romero{wearing a pair of the archbishops actual glasses] Tony Plena is ,as always, superb, as a tortured priest{interesting, in America a conscience striken portrayal of a cleric is always sexual}Harold Gould is fine as a member of the""eight families"". As fine as this movie is, i was left wanting more. This is an excellent portrayal of  what can only be descrbed as a saint.",984700800,45,1738,5.174377224199288
335273,4,6301589068,"Although constrained by a limited budget, this film manages to include scenes of tremendous power that will stay with most attentive viewers for a long time.  There is a sense of realism and a portrayal of large scale social events that makes this film potentially useful for at least instructing Americans about the kind of oppression that is the norm in many poor countries.  Unfortunately, the film assumes that viewers are already familiar with the historical context of the Salvadorean setting, or else deliberately downplays such content so as to avoid controversy and focus on the moral example provided by Romero, and to generally awe viewers with its impactful portrayal of social struggles.  But still, the film is far better at offering some educational benefits than most other films dealing with historical subject matter.  Final sequence of film transcends the particulars of El Salvador and strikes me as a timeless testament to all the victims of social change in our modern era.  Of note is that the PG-13 rating that is so prominently displayed on promotional materials for this film is probably a fake one - I have found no listings for this film in the MPAA's official ratings directory, nor on its searchable internet data base.  1989 was a year when there was a noticeable conservative shift in rating policies, when films like this started to receive R ratings for violent content.  While the film would have gotten a PG in the 1970s, in the 1990s it would've received an R.  If the Catholic church was very involved in this production, it may have wished to avoid an R rating, but then the box should be more properly labeled as a film that is not rated.  Errors (?) of this type are very common on home video releases.",983923200,3,1743,4.802675585284281
335274,5,6301589068,"This is, as other reviewers have noted, a beautiful story told very well.  It is also a horrifying story of the evil that men can do.  Finally, and most profoundly, it is a tale of the power of God to change the lives of men, making saints out of a mild bishop and many of his flock.
I very much doubt that a person could remain unmoved by this film.  But the movie, great as it is, is not just a well-crafted appeal to sentimentality; the story of this man and his people is a call to action.",970704000,4,493,4.010204081632653
335275,4,6301589068,"This movie,is very strong in its content, and that is what it should be, since the point of this movie was to open the eyes of the American people, so they would be aware of the horrors, that happened in El Salvador, during  a time of political upheavel, which U.S tax dollars could have been  responsible for much of it, in the form of arms to the military (which were  responsible for most of the killings). The movie, does a great job at  demonstrating the love and devotion Father Romero had for the poor in El  Salvador, and his desire to do whatever possible to improve their lives.  It is a shame that he was murdered. Yet he is never forgotten, and neither  are the thousands of murdered salvadoreans. The movie, may not be as  accurate in telling the facts, since even to this day, there is still a  question in the salvadorean people of what really caused this disaster. I  think that in order for this movie to be  appreciated, it would take  someone who, has experienced or can sympathize with someone who has had to  fear for their life,simply because of their believes or for not belonging  to an acceptable social class.  I think that viewers need to view this  movie, not as a movie, but as a reality which occured, and which hopefully  they will never have to experience.",959472000,2,1288,4.482758620689655
335276,1,6301589068,I thought this movie was incredibly boring. I had trouble not falling asleep,956016000,2,76,4.923076923076923
335277,5,6301589068,"This is not the type of video you rent for a one time viewing, you have to own it so you can watch it several times and share with friends. The story is simple. A scholarly, non political priest is surprisingly named the arch  bishop of el salvador(""A nice compromise choice""). Eventually he  realizes that he must take a stand against this violence and oppression, as  a result he is loved by the salvadoran people and it also leads to his  assasination.
One must understand the political situation to better  appreciate this movie. El salvador was on the brink of civil war and the  sandanista takeover in nicaragua brought panic to the military and wealthy  landholders as they feared the same thing happening in el salvador. It was  only with the military assistance from the united states that kept el  salvador from falling to revolutionaries. What makes this movie so special  is that it goes beyond the superficial political issue of that time of  whether the US should be aiding the military. It's mans inhumanity to man  and it is all our responsibility to fight against it. Romero is against all  violence including that initiated by the revolutionaries.
This movie is  powerful and violent. It has to be violent to tell the story but what is  depicted in this movie is mild compared to what really happened there. The  quality of the production is mediocre and it's obviously a low budget  affair. Many of the same extras and tertiary characters appear regardless  of where the scene supposedly takes place(aquilares or san salvador). The  acting is solid but not spectacular. It is raul julia's romero who steals  the show with an oscar caliber performance. The fact that the movie was  produced by a religious order of the catholic church(the paulists) is a  plus. The most moving scene is when  romero and the people of aquilares  take back the local cathedral from the military by courageously walking  into the church and beginning a mass. The people got the courage to do this  when romero risks his life to gather the blessed sacrament(consecrated  communion hosts) from the church alter. Another powerful moment is when  like jesus in the garden of gethsemene, romero painfully prays at the grave  of his fallen friend contemplating his imminent death. ""Take me i'm  yours"" he says. I doubt if such scenes would ever make their way into  a hollywood production but they should because romero was a catholic  bishop. There is also a paternalistic view that the church alone can help  these people which is something of a negative. There is also an attempt to  demonstrate all the various views of the situation. In addition to the  church, the military and the guerillas one sees the views of the  aristocracy, the government and the indifferent. Violence affects all in  this film not just the poor or the church. That's not the case in other  films about this period like oliver stone's ""salvador"" which goes  so far as to depict the guerillas as if they were freedom fighting  hippies.
Over all this is a great movie. I would recommend it to any  adult but catholics especially will find it  moving.

Romero is now being strongly considered for sainthood by the Pope, although the people of Central America simply refer to ""Saint Romero for the Americas"".

The story is compelling and gets kids talking and thinking and is worth FIVE stars.

I am not happy that the dubbing in Spanish is in Castillian accents from Spain.  I am showing this in a Native Literacy class of Mexican and Salvadoran students and talking about destroying authenticity!!  I prefer to show it in the regular English rather than having my kids hearing a Spanish that Salvadorans don't speak.  There are also no Spanish subtitles, which stinks for all my Spanish classes.

335540,4,6301589068,"This is usually where it occurs, as if an evil whirlwind chooses a particular plot of earth to churn its victims.  Following the professional life of Oscar Romero after his ordination of Archbishop, it portrays a man trying to stand as a beacon of light according to his beliefs, as darkness descends on all sides.  As a production of the Paulist Fathers it lays on the piety a bit thick at times.  But this film well captures a priest's crisis of conscience as reflected in the trauma of his society - and overcome by it.

At this point the film is a matter of history, though one that still festers close as a narco track under the skin of Central America.  Romero's assassination opened the way for full-scale civil war, removing the inconvenient barrier of the Catholic Church to the ""final solution"" of the subversive problem in the Salvadoran state.  This is what the oligarchy/military axis of San Salvador desired, knowing the US stood at its back. (Poles may still revere the name of Ronald Reagan as the world's great liberator; the survivors of Central America say the name with different feeling).  The gang violence that now rips through this region is a direct legacy of the social and moral void created by Romero's killers.",1478044800,,1239,4.734883720930233

But Oscar Romero himself remains one of my all-time heroes--defending the poor and disenfranchised of El Salvador against the US-backed oligarchy. The essential events revolve around the land reform efforts of the 1970s and the introduction of liberation theology. Although Romero tows the Vatican line (JPII feared that the Jesuits and others who practiced LT were socialists or even communists), he eventually separates himself from the anti-Gospel being preached by official church dogma of the time, and prophetically calls for the government to stop its genocide against their own people. He was assassinated in 1980 while celebrating Mass--his prophetic voice is missed nowdays.",1419811200,,857,5.492424242424242

The cinematography and symbolism built into the screenplay where phenomenal. Even with the artistic liberties that where taken for dramas sake (look up Rowena Hills paper on Romero if interested) it did a great job of giving the viewer an idea of what it was like in this time of turmoil in cold war era El Salvador. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone interested in the topic.

A similar polarization is occurring now in my native country Venezuela with somewhat a reverse situation where the oppressors are the leftists in power.

This is a fairly modest, low-budget production, but well handled despite its limitations.  Many important characters are rather sketchily portrayed, primarily a weakness of the script; however, at the heart of the picture stands a magnificent characterization by Julia.  His touching scenes as a frail, sensitive fellow, thrust into a terrible conflict without any particular ambition to take on the task, are amazingly in contrast to later scenes where his righteous anger and indignation rise from the horrors that he witnesses.  These scenes of explosive high emotion are some of the best you will see from any screen actor, ever!  No home entertainment edition of this film that I know of provides us with a very good copy of the film, which is regrettable; however, Julia's performance makes you quickly forget such considerations.  See this film and you must deeply regret that the actor's life was so short, and that we were thus robbed of seeing his potential for superb acting revealed in many more films than the few in which he appeared.",1391299200,,1215,4.845410628019324

Is one born with this ability or is it a quality that grows with time? What would lead a person to sacrifice his (or her) own life for a higher good? Romero provides its audience with some profound insights into these questions and more.

Rather, Jesus would insist that His true followers work for justice and a radical change in the very structures that produce poverty and dehumanization to the least of His brethern in the first place.  This movie conveys that powerful message and it took on an added significance for me because i worked for a year in El Salvador as a teacher, beginning just several months after Romero's assassination.

In today's world where political expediency and self preservation trump standing up for your faith, Archbishop Romero reminds all of us that one person can make a huge difference.

We watched this film when I was in seminary, and it was one I chose to add to my personal collection. Romero begins his journey self-centered and in attentive to the controversy in the country where he is assigned to serve. He has all of the best that life has to offer. He could have continued that way. But Romero was a man with compassion in his heart, and when he was finally confronted with the truth, he took action, and this action cost him his life.

A tribute to Romero and his life, this wonderful motion picture calls us to ask ourselves what we would do in similar circumstances. Would we close our eyes and be safe? Or would we stand up for what is right? Because of the intensity and violence in the movie, it is rated PG 13, and I agree with the rating.",1330387200,,983,4.360655737704918

Problem: It never explains why there was trouble in El Salvador so unless you remembered news items you were in the dark about it.

336485,5,6301589068,"There is so much going on in this world.  Some wonderful, beautiful experiences are also a product of chaos.  This true story of Archbishop Oscar Romero is one of those experiences.  The headlines of abuse of my beloved Catholic faith aren't uncommon lately, and it sickens me, and they should be reported, but don't forget the good.  The good things get buried under the horrors of a newer, sensational story.  Priest abuse is undoubtably a head turner when the media pick up on it.  How unfair not only to all the victims, but also to parishioners who still truly believe and support our church.  Our church, not the crimes of these officials.
There are many historical saints who are inspirational to both protestant and Catholics alike.  Most know of St. Francis, or Anthony, also Peter, Paul and the rest of that old gang of their's.  Unlike the priest abuse stories, these stories don't linger as first and foremost of a representation of this beautiful church.
Oscar Romero is a modern day saint, even though he has yet to be canonized as such.
Many Catholics don't know his story, even though his death will soon reach it's 31rst anniversary.
His story is a positive light on Catholicism, a breath of fresh air.  Talk about priest abuse?  Look how these El Salvadorian priests were abused only for standing up for basic freedoms for the people.  We need to know about these stories, especially during this time of darkness of abusive priests. Who knows what is going on with abuse of our church, even as I type this? Stories like this are a positive, refreshing light on the church today.
Young Catholics need to know about these saintly, heroic lives, instead of being bombarded by the shameful, sinful news stories of abusers that cover themselves with the title of  Catholic ""Priest"".  There are also ""heros of the faith"".  ~ praymor4me",1296086400,3,1847,4.782334384858044
336486,4,6301589068,"Bishop Oscar Romero is well portrayed by Raul Julia in this story of an unassuming, bookish priest in violence torn El Salvador who is transformed upon ascending to the role of bishop. Biographically based, Romero's change from conflict avoidance and accommodation with the powers-that-be into a mode of challenge and confrontation of those powers is also well done.

The indifference of the privileged elites to the plight of the poor, the armed suppression of dissent in a police state, and the tendency of the church to be complicit with those powers is dramatic and powerful. While the contrasts and charicatures seem sharp and visceral, they don't seem overblown or contrived.

Romero's death at the end by an assassin while celebrating the eucharist during mass is not only iconic, but also historically precise.

While the movie is about 20 years old, this has become a classic story of contemporary Christian witness and won't ""get old."" This compelling movie will stick with the viewer. You'll want to learn more about Romero and other faithful witnesses in the Americas who endured great personal sacrifice in the 70s and 80s, and about liberation theology - about how God has a declared preference for the poor, the weak and the vulnerable.

This is great for church groups - youth to adult - that are exploring Christian faith and witness. It strongly portrays the challenges and the difficulties of responding to a call to serve. It shows why faithfulness is not simply about saving other souls, but saving your own. It demonstrates the struggle for faithful action in society, particularly at society's ugliest and most dangerous boundaries. It explains how Jesus could be crucified - hint: it wasn't because he was loving and forgiving.

It does not end ""happily ever after."" The truly faithful life in such contexts often does not. You'll have to supply the end in your mind - Matthew 25:21 ""Well done, good and faithful servant ....""",1292198400,5,1950,5.006172839506172

The most inspiring scence in the movie is when the corrupt and tyrant run government close the church, and Romero goes in to get the Eucharist,the guards shoot the alter preventing him from getting the Eucharist,and Romero leaves. He comes back for a second time and picks up all the Eucharist wafers off the floor, and they are shooting at the alter while he is doing this! He leaves, and gets in his car.... A few minutes later he comes back puts on his robe and goes into the church and celebrates the Mass, and the guards leave him alone!!!!
He fights for the poor, and the poor have such respect for him, when he is not afraid; they are not afraid!
The end is sad because they shoot him while he is saying mass!!! Very sad!!!! But what a life he lived; for the poorest people in EL Salvador!!! After watching the movie it made me appreciate my Catholic faith and how grateful I am to live in AMerica where I can celebrate my faith without the fear of dying! AMen!
Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!
any Catholic who has left the church will be amazed at this movie!

336539,5,6301589068,"As John Duigan's directorial debut, it is another astounding example of great work, as Salvador for Oliver Stone and Gandhi for Richard Attenborough, I am pleasantly surprised to discover.
  The story is well portrayed, with its various shocking aspects and characters, and various essential details covered.  Brief references to the elites' views of themselves as ""pioneers"" like the North Americans, and the role of coffee and sugar cane are subtle but noticeable and tastefully included, maintaining the focus of the story on the Archbishop.  Raul Julia and the cast do a great job.  Perhaps the only thing missing is a reference to establish the malevolent role of the US and its military, such as the School of the Americas.  One mention of a letter by the Archbishop raises the dimension, anyway, but does not show the toxic influence of US anti-communist state terrorism, or even Jimmy Carter's flirtation with decency.

336543,2,6301589068,"Let me start off by recognizing the makers of this film who are the Paulist press. Any good Catholic knows that the Paulists tend to toy with dissent. Now having stated that on to the review:
I agree that Raul Julia's performance was exceptional. He brought out he character of the late Archbishop very well. And along with the sets and extras they merit 3 stars out of 3 .
What I did not like about the film is its overtly gross support of Liberation Theology that has been denounced by the Church as heresy, due to its incorporation of Marxism. The archbishop himself wasn't a liberation theologian...he denouced Marxism. And he was critical of the greed of the rich. He didn't hate them. He was constantly reminding them of the need to look after the poor.
The film also failed to show the spirituality of this man...and merely portrays him as a fighter that gave provocative speeches that aroused the passions of the crowds. But it fails to tell us that he was also cautious....

This is a powerful movie based on history in the late '70s in El Salvardor, where a country's leaders were killing thousands of dissidents including clergy in the Roman Catholic Church. Julia plays ""Archbishop Romero."" He is interesting to watch and the center of the story.

This is a violent, sometimes unpleasant movie to watch but if your concerned about profanity or sex, you don't have to worry: it's not here. That's hard to find in a modern action-drama.

336595,5,6301589068,"This inspiring film is carried by the powerful portrayal by Raul Julia of the courageous archbishop of El Salvador , Oscar Romero who was assassinated  by the military junta supported, armed and funded by the US.

The film shows a reluctant hero who is catapalted  from political complacency with the exploitative ruling class into an outspoken voice for the persecuted  poor of El Salvador.

The ultra-conservative Romero was chosen to be archbishop by the  Vatican because he was expected to maintain the status quo. (Pope John Paul's II obsession with anti-communism was the impetus behind the  Vatican's  determination to eradicate liberation theology- the spiritual movement that promoted justice for the poor  based on the Gospels.)

The religious term 'metanoia'means  a radical change of heart and  Raul Julia sensitively and intensely captures this  spiritual event within Romero after his priest-friend is extrajudicially murdered.

Romero's emerging courage to be  the voice of the voiceless in the face of a violent state adversary is inspiring and teaches us that the timid, the conservative can rise up against injustice. Must rise up to end the  suffering of the persecuted poor.

336666,5,6301589068,"I watched this movie again today, for at least the 5th time, and, as always, it quickly brought tears to my eyes. This film describes how an individual can allow himself to be transformed by events into taking a firm, courageous stand in the face of those who desire to use whatever force is necessary to retain their position of privilege. If this were an American film, the protagonist might go out a purchase a .45, and would then proceed to seek and destroy his oppressors. Romero used a different approach - he employed his spiritual / moral authority. There is a particular scene in ""Romero"" that vividly portrays his creative use of spiritual power. After he is kicked out of a church by the military, Romero & his orderly drive away and return with Romero's vestments (the robes he uses to perform the mass). Romero puts on his robes and then he and his orderly begin a slow, deliberate march towards the church. A crowd of townspeople see what Romero is doing, and several fall into line behind him. This is all spontaneous but quite deliberate, and, with Romero at the lead, they approach the church door, where a soldier waits, and as they approach the soldier lifts his gun and shouts at them to stop. Romero continues past the soldier, who drops his gun, and he and the townspeople re-take the church.

Romero's example, while powerful, did not take root and grow, and El Salvador continued to experience civil war. This approach is also not pre-dominant in our own American culture (in general, we continue to prefer the use of brute force), but it's out there, as a robe, waiting to be donned.",1151452800,10,1608,4.6421052631578945

336670,4,6301589068,"I have a basic tenet that this country (the US, I mean) needs more socially conscious (or even downright political) cinema. In recent years, new technology has led to more and more flash in the movies but decreased substance.  Many critics lay the blame for the current trend toward cinematic escapism to the current political climate, and there's certainly some truth to that assertion.  But it's just as likely that American moviemakers just have too many toys at hand to concern themselves with grown-up themes.

This 1989 film, though filmed in English and starring a major cinematic figure (the late Raul Julia), was certainly not a typical Hollywood production.  It was reportedly produced by the Paulist Fathers and funding in part came from donations by concerned Catholics.  It's a ""small,"" film but certainly compelling.  Some have lamented the film's relative predictability.  But, of course, screenwriter John Sacret Young and director John Duigan were limited by the actual facts of Romero's life.  There may have been ways of putting a little more punch into the plotline, I suppose, but overall the facts of Romero's life are riveting enough.

In the classic social drama, the political awakening of the hero is a pretty standard theme.  Think NORMA RAE or THE CHINA SYNDROME or COMING HOME from the 1970s (the last gasp of social consciousness in American film, it seems).  As in those films, the hero Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador is something of a political naif.  A bit timid and bookish, he is promoted to the archbishopric because he seems among the least likely clergy to rock the boat.  His gradual transformation to a champion of the poor and oppressed comes about when fellow priests are murdered and tortured and he sees the brutality of his country's repressive government for what it is.  As a man of principle and a man of God, he has no choice but to act.

The film's greatest strength is, in fact, its presentation of Romero's transformation as painful and conflicted.  Once welcome at the mansions of the very rich, he has become a social and political pariah by the film's end.  He has also become, in a very profound way, much more of a man of God.",1099785600,14,2191,4.846774193548387
336671,3,6301589068,"Through this imperfect movie, I learned to love a saint.

The movie depicts Oscar Arturo Romero from his new appointment as El Salvador's archbishop until his murder while saying Mass in 1980. Between those endpoints Romero experiences the poverty of his people and their suffering at the hands of the military government. More and more, he takes an active role in opposing the brutalization of his people, opposing also his bishops who preferred to deal with purely spiritual matters. But Romero's vision of the gospel doesn't let him off so easy. To live as a follower of Jesus means encountering the Cross. Romero comes to see that avoiding ""politics"" means abandoning the poor and oppressed to their tormentors.

Raul Julia does a creditable, if somewhat plodding job of portraying the Archbishop. Julia doesn't quite get down to the interior fire that drove Romero to a date with martyrdom. Romero's real speeches are fiery and poetic, qualities that Julia's Romero does not seem able to capture.

In spite of its shortcomings, ""Romero"" delivers a stirring portrait of a man who risked all, opposing his institution's placidity in the face of evil, challenging its reluctance to engage the world as well as his sacrificing own inclination to live quietly.",1096416000,30,1260,5.0772946859903385
336731,5,6301589068,"The most unlikely of heroes, Romero, with owlish glasses and demeanor, is reluctantly thrust into a role much like Thomas More almost five centuries earlier.

20th century El Salvador, like 16th century England, is enduring bloodshed and havoc. Insurgent Communist rebels compete with paramilitary squads and the oligarchy for control of the tiny Central American nation.  Priests and the flock they lead are caught in the middle.  Those who cry for justice are photographed and marked for extinction because they speak the language of Marxism.

Archbishop Romero recognizes that Marxists and the ruling oligarchy are merely obverse sides of the same coin-- ideologies who rule by force contrary to the the rule of God.

He is equally harsh with Communist sympathizers as he is with the paramilitary squads who rape, torture and execute advocates of justice and human rights.

Like a nail driven into wood, Romero meets each new situation, bewildered at first, but rising to the occasion with increasing faith, anger and determination.

In one scene, he arrives at a church which has been turned into an army barracks. He announces that he has come to remove the Blessed Sacrament. A belligerent soldier responds by unloading a round of bullets into the tabernacle and shatters the crucifix hanging above the altar. Romero stands transfixed, astonished at the utter desecration, then leaves. He pauses outside where a crowd has gathered, unsure as he himself is what he will do next.

Suddenly, collecting his courage, he wheels around. He brushes past the insolent soldier and stoops to gather the consecrated wafers in trembling hands. The soldier fires another round above Romero's head.  Undeterred by the gunfire, the intimidation, and the soldier who shoves Romero with his boot, he completes his work then exits.

But he isn't finished. He returns yet again to restore the church to its rightful owner--the people of God.  The soldiers in their turn stare blandly at the audacity of this meek soldier of God who dares to stand up to their jackbooted authority and in his turn expel evil.

Archbishop Romero fights every battle his Redeemer once fought: the apathy of the elite, the treachery of those in power, and betrayal within his own ranks. One of his own priests reveals that he carries a weapon. Romero angrily and loudly denounces him because ""You lose God just as the others have!"" Another parishioner denounces Romero for betraying their class by ""forcing"" her baby to be baptized along with ""all those indians.""

This video should stand next to A Man For All Seasons. Raul Julia, like Paul Scofield, has memorably portrayed one of the Church's most celebrated martyrs.",1046390400,92,2686,5.077272727272727

336735,5,6301589068,"Oscar Romero, Archbishop of El Salvador, had the courage to live the teaching of Jesus, even though this meant alienating the rich and powerful who oppressed, tortured, murdered, and defrauded the poor of that nation. He stood in the pulpit of the national cathedral and urged soldiers to obey their Lord and disobey commands of oppression. He paid for this, taking a bullet to the heart while blessing the wine during mass.
This movie portrays the story of a quiet, bookish man who stood in the gap between the machine of dehumanizing globalization and the children of Jesus. We watch him wrestle with discovering an authentic Christian response to the injustices and oppression prevalent in El Salvador. We see him reprimand all those who would practice violence, whether as military authority, rebels, or institutionalized violence that robs people of their humanity and ability to feed their families.
The movie was filmed in Mexico, not Hollywood. Raul Julia deserved an Oscar for his performance as Romero. Mexican extras bring a feeling of authenticity that could not have been realized in Hollywood. The telling manages to avoid most of the ""splatter"" depictions of violence that most box office draws include, and by so doing, makes the violence even more heinous.
This is a powerful story, whether you are Christian or Pagan, Marxist or Capitalist. It is superbly told. This is the story of a person finding his authentic place in the midst of a struggle for justice.

I have heard a previous reviewer state that this movie is good but not as good as ""Missing"" or Oliver Stone's ""Salvador"". I have to disagree. I thought Romero was obviously better than Missing and it really gives Salvador a run for its dinero. Oliver Stone's excellent Salvador was a great movie and ironically, one of the best, BEST parts of the movie was when the Romero in ""Salvador"" gave his last speech, similar, but a little different to the one Raul Julia makes in Romero. The speech in Salvador was also done in Spanish, maybe that added to the passion and reality, I don't know, but that speech in both films is one of the most meaningful,powerful, and courageous political speeches every in my opinion.
One reason I really like Romero was how he started out at the beginning; not wanting to make any trouble, quiet and polite. Kind of like.... Most Americans! We could see ourselves as Romero, outraged by the injustice of the time. If there is ONE criticism to make of the film, is that it I wish it could really put more emphasis on the U.S. involvement in Salvador and how Reagan's boys were knee-deep in assisting the most reactionary, and violent regime in South America. Thats maybe where ""Salvador"" eeks ahead of Romero, the fact that they really put emphasis on how the media blindly followed Reagan's neo-conservative or fascist, take your pick, policies in Salvador and how huge the American military involvement was in setting up the terror.
All in all, a great, great film that needs to be watched by all. It is a shame that the masses are fed the usual nonsense movies by Hollywood, the only semi-serious movies we see now adays, are Mel Gibson-type military Gung-Ho characters that glorify war, violence militarization, and blind love of country and not nearly enough powerful, brave movies that look critically upon the powerful interests that rule this nation. Romero is certainly one of the latter.",1016150400,3,2012,4.767908309455588
336737,4,6301589068,"Though a worthy effort, Romero doesn't reach the intense feel of a Missing or Salvador. There's a pervasive sense of horror and fear in these latter largely missing from Romero despite laudable efforts at conveying the same rawness of police state terror. Perhaps the staging is a little too tidy or the death squads too ordinary to reach the same level of abject dread.
Nonetheless there is much to praise in Romero. Raul Julia's transformation from meek upper-class toady to passionate spokesman for the masses is eloquently understated, and no less powerful. I especially like the way the filmakers portrayed elements of the elite, humanising them and giving them a chance to speak, even as their death squad hirelings carry out the bloody dirty work. Perhaps the movie's high point is Romero's pivotal refusal to continue baptism privileges for the well-bred, thus affirming his new spiritual loyalty, but also sealing his earthly doom. It's a quietly powerful and revealing moment.
I wish the producers had showed more candor in implicating the US's role in the repression. Except for Romero's plea to stop arming the military and the presence of a thuggish American advisor (he looks North American but is not identified), there is no mention of repression's ultimate sponsor. Yet the US was waist deep in these events, as Reagan's boys in the basement  undercut every Congressional effort to moderate support. Principled films such as Romero need to be fearlessly historical in putting such facts before the American public, pleasant or not. Even so, Romero is a moving portrayal of one man's evolution from spiritual cypher to heroic symbol, and poses a challenge to conscionable people everywhere.",1003017600,7,1706,5.15884476534296

A m, la razn para la pelcula es para que lo dems del mundo pueda ver la injusticia en este pas y para que otros afuera quieran ayudarlos.  Es una llamada a la accin.",988761600,3,1552,4.285223367697594
336739,5,6301589068,"La pel&iacute;cula Romero se trata de los problemas del gobierno de El Salvador y los efectos que estos ten&iacute;an en las personas de la sociedad.  Tambi&eacute;n se trata de la iglesia cat&oacute;lica.  La pel&iacute;cula muestra la iglesia como si fuera la &uacute;nica esperanza de una naci&oacute;n oprimida y el mecanismo de cambio y revoluci&oacute;n.  El mensaje de esta historia es muy fuerte, y esta presentado muy bien.  Romero, quien era el arzobispo de El Salvador durante los a&ntilde;os setenta, es el personaje principal de la pel&iacute;cula.  Despu&eacute;s de verla, una persona probablemente dir&aacute; que Romero es el revolucionario m&aacute;s importante del pa&iacute;s durante aquella &eacute;poca.  Es un hombre que a pesar de todo lo problem&aacute;tico del pa&iacute;s, y toda la violencia contra su gente, cre&iacute;a en el principio de la no violencia.  El escritor de la historia muchas veces representa a Romero como si fuera Jes&uacute;s Cristo.  Hay unos ejemplos muy significativos de eso en la pel&iacute;cula.  Un momento en que los militares le quitan la ropa a Romero violentamente para martirizarlo enfrente de sus seguidores.  Esta situaci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n le pas&oacute; a Jes&uacute;s antes de que lo crucificaran.  Otro ejemplo de esta comparaci&oacute;n es cuando Romero entra a la iglesia y empieza a hacer la misa aunque los militares hab&iacute;an tomado la iglesia.  Jes&uacute;s tambi&eacute;n entr&oacute; al templo y tir&oacute; a los empresarios y vendedores afuera del templo.  La pel&iacute;cula se trata de muchos temas, pero el m&aacute;s importante es que nuestra iglesia puede ser una herramienta para el cambio social y la revoluci&oacute;n.  La historia de Romero explica como la iglesia sirvi&oacute; para unir a la gente martirizada y oprimida, d&aacute;ndoles una voz y un esp&iacute;ritu renovados.  Me gust&oacute; la pel&iacute;cula y se me hace que su mensaje es muy importante; yo recomiendo que todos la vean.",988675200,9,1989,5.62751677852349
336740,5,6301589068,"Esta pelicula es la histor&iacute;a de un conflicto soc&iacute;al en El Salvador y  de la transformaci&oacute;n del Arzobispo Oscar Romero (Raul Julia) de un padre pasivo a un defensor de su iglesia y la gente.  A &eacute;l no le gusta hacer cambios pero eventos con asesinatos y mentir le hicieron sus ojos abrir.  Esta pel&iacute;cula no es para los d&eacute;biles.  Tiene la violencia y mutilaci&oacute;n de la gente de El Salvador.  Tambi&eacute;n es una buena pel&iacute;cula en que muestra a los estado unideses la opresi&oacute;n de la guerra en un pa&iacute;s pobre y las v&iacute;ctimas del camb&iacute;o soc&iacute;al.  Los pobres quieren justicia y liberaci&oacute;n pero los ricos tienen control a los pobres luchan con sus voces y los ricos con las armas.  Todos vendr&aacute;n a apreciar los varios temas y lecciones conectados con la fuerza dentro de la iglesia y con la gente con esperanza y coraje contra los militares y el gobierno.  Por ejemplo cuando Romero protegi&oacute; la iglesia y los sacramentos destruidos por los soldados.  Romero regresa con la gente y todos rezan.  Un conflicto entre los pobres y los ricos era que, los ricos piensan que la iglesia es solamente para ellos pero la iglesia es para todos y especialmente ellos estan perdido.  Los padres resuelven los problemas con palabras y no oidan.  Con amor ellos ayudan a la gente perdido.  No soy catol&iacute;ca pero creo que en el poder de Dios y la uni&oacute;n de la gente pueden conquistar todo.  Tuve mucha emoci&oacute;n cuando mir&eacute; esta pel&iacute;cula y no me gust&oacute; el sufrimiento de la gente.",988588800,,1603,5.115384615384615

7812853,5,6301589068,"This is simply one of the most inspiring, gripping films I've ever watched. Raul Julia is simply amazing in this role, which makes me want to see who won the Oscar that year because I doubt the actor was better than this. Romero is a very accurately portrayed story of a Salvadoran priest who became a bishop and is about to become a saint of the Catholic church. Archbishop Romero gave his life to the poor majority of El Salvador, a country that was struggling to emerge from feudalism at the time this film was made (now it's struggling to emerge from neo-feudalism). If you are at all religious you will love this film. But I am not a believer, and I loved it too. By the end of it I had tears in my eyes. The last movies that did this for me were Doctor Zhivago, Autumn Sonata, Lies my Father Told Me, and some pet movies I can't rmember.",1522454400,,843,4.24223602484472
