Cowboys are herding cattle when a dust storm arises. They take shelter in a cabin. One man reads about the effects of the Great War. Range land was converted to wheat land, then the price of wheat dropped and ruined farmers. When they return to herding they find blood from a butchered steer. Can they find the man who did this? They go into town for supplies and food. A bartender tells them about a local strong man, he is also a crack shot. One man hurts a young woman on the dance floor, there is a fight. A wallet is lost in the struggle, it is empty when recovered. Stony Brook meets Smith and Johnson at Irenes home. Jobs are scarce. One man was fired from his job because he refused to pay graft. Theres no Relief for him.

Young Will Parker meets his friends and they have dinner. Roast beef and cornbread. Mrs. Parker sees Balsinger about a job for her husband (selling jobs?). There is a disagreement. Stony Brook helps her get her money back after a fight. Will Parker is not allowed into the grazing area because he shot game. Rusty talks to him. Can he lasso a deer? He is caught with the goods! Does hunger take precedence over game laws? Stony Brook tells the Governor about the conditions under Balsinger. The Mesquiteers rescue Mrs. Parker, but they are wanted by the Sheriff! Mr. Parker is beaten up. Can Will Parker escape to help him? Yes, but he is pursued by those who are out to get him dead or alive.

Will Parker is cornered, the US Marshal orders out the US Cavalry to get him. The sound of gunshots tells a battle is on. [This pads out the story.] The Three Mesquiteers will try to rescue Will Parker alive. The Sheriff says no shooting. Will he be double-crossed? Will gets a car ride from a broadcaster who boasts about the lies they told about Will Parker! Will goes home to say goodbye to his parents. Then he visits the bank and meets Balsinger. There is a shooting. The newspaper tells about the end of the Relief Racket. Will there be peace with the new administration? [Do broadcasters still make up stories to influence their listeners?]

The Three Mesquiteers rode around to bring justice and help to the common people who were suffering from people like Balsinger (or his equivalent). These type of movies were popular in the 1930s and 1940s during the Great Depression. Private detective movies began to replace Westerns in the 1940s, only to give way to the numerous police procedurals that dominate movie dramas today. The story of a Sheriff in cahoots with a big landowner echoes the Lincoln County War in 1880 New Mexico. The Johnson County War in 1893 Wyoming began when a big landowner tried to force small ranchers and farmers off their lands so they could be taken.",1430611200,,2740,4.52929292929293

Special footnote -- The 32 year old John Wayne was fortunate enough to have talented writers around him to write novels that could be adapted into vehicles for his career, as well as short stories and screenplays that would immortalise him as the American hero. This film is one such example. When you watch this film you're not watching it for the story (like you would do in 'Rio Grande' or 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'), you're watching it to see John Wayne in action. He is the romantic embodiment of what it was like for the settling community to live in the post-civil war era. Despite the fact that most of these westerns distort history, what Wayne delivers gives you access to his humanity. That's what we like about him.
