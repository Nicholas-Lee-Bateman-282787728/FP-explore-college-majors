2522665,5,B000EMGIDC,"Where do I start? I couldn't even believe how unbelieveibly hysterical this show was when I first watched it. When it first started airing I thought it was a waste of time because the commericals made it look retarded. But one night when I was watching [adult swim] I decided to give it a chance. Man, that could possibly have been the smartest decision in my life. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing on the TV screen. I thought to myself ""could someone have came up with something this great??Episode after Episode I was never dissappointed. Each episode has it's own originality that never makes it feel like you're watching the same thing twice. The jokes are never reused (Unlike Family Guy which uses the same jokes over and over) the characters are easily likeable and have their own personality about themselves. Whether it's Dr. Orpheous's over-dramatic tone or Monarch's schemeing to ruin Dr. Venture's life you will never want this show to end. It's kinda stupid how they're releasing the DVD on May 30th '06 when they already have it completed. (If you want proof look up ""The Mantis-Eye Experiment A Venture Bros. Fansite) No matter what you're looking for in a cartoon whether it's action, killing, blood, gore, comedy, adult situations, histerical-ass jokes, this show has every thing that you could ever want. The Venture Bros. is easily my favorite show by a long shot. Get your ass off of that Family Guy kick and check this show out. I bet after you do you'll look at shows like Family Guy and think ""Did used to think this was funny???"" trust me I know. I could use up 100 pages describing the da Greatness of this show but I'm going to sum it up like this. This show can't be touched by any other show. You can't compare this to any other cartoon because it's in a league of it's own. I can't wait for the DVD and 2nd season. [adult swim] needs to produce more shows like this and stop wasting time on shows like Minoriteam.",1142640000,11,1953,4.566951566951567
2522666,5,B000EMGIDC,"They've been running these episodes for what seems like forever, but I am still jazzed to get this super-great set. Of all the shows AS has put together, this one really has the most depth and lasting humor. Most of the stuff on AS is funny but completely disposable. Venture Bros. gets funnier with each successive viewing. My only complaint with the show is that the episodes generally seem to cramped- like they are trying to shoehorn an hour of show into a half hour time slot. I would love to eventually see some expanded ""director"" versions of this material, with a little more breathing room and maybe the curses unbleeped (yeah i know good luck). But that complaint aside, it's just brilliant stuff. Smart and dumb at the same time, making pop culture references pulled from the span of human history; the show really asks a lot of it's audience. But it really pays off. I still catch new stuff after repeated viewings. I'm very excited to have this in my collection. I'm a little worried about the quality of the set- a whole season packed onto two discs? It seems like image quality might suffer from overcompression, but it won't keep me from buying it.

Oh yeah and I **can't wait** for season 2 to start! It's good to have stuff that holds up to repeated viewings, but I want some NEW shows!!",1142294400,11,1305,4.553191489361702
2522667,5,B000EMGIDC,"I can't wait to get Venture Brothers Season One On DVD on May 30th, 2006. I will enjoy watching the Venture Brothers and waiting for future seasons of Venture Brothers to come out on DVD. Season Two of Venture Brothers starts in June 2006.

2522668,5,B000EMGIDC,"Not as instantly accesible as Sealab 2021 or ATHF but easily as good, if not better. During a bout of sickness I watched the entire first season back to back and was subsequently hooked!

This show, like Sealab, ATHF and Harvey Birdman is bloody hilarious, by far the funniest animated series since Ren & Stimpy (I'm told The Tick was good but managed to miss that).

I don't understand why these cartoons haven't really broken in Britain, particularly considering the similar nature / humour of most sucessful british comedy series (Spaced, Mighty Boosh, Alan Partridge, Big Train, Brass eye, The Day Today, 15 Storeys High etc).

It's also worth mentioning that the music (particularly the title theme) by JG Thirwell, is amazing! Apparently his Steroid Maximus album 'Ectopia' is worth checking out if you are into the Venture Bros music. I'm gonna order it now!

Anyway, I'm chuffed this is getting a DVD release as it is one of the funniest series I have seen for years, can't wait for season 2!

Hats off to Adult Swim, oh and Carl RULES!

2522669,5,B000EMGIDC,"Some of the new shows Adult Swim has released are not so good shows like 12oz mouse and Squdbillies. But still they're brigning great ones to the table like Moral Oral and of course The Boondocks and the great Venture Brothers. The Venture Brothers is one that stood out with originality and of course lots of laughs for those of us that are addicted to Adult Swim. You have your total nut case Brock that is an ex special agent turned bodyguard for Dr. Venture and the two idiot brothers Dean and Hank that are dumb to the point where you can't help but laugh at them. Even though the show is named after the two brothers you would think it was really all about Brock and Dr. Venture.

Brock makes this series way funnier than you'd expect because of his brutal tactics of guarding a Venture and his facial features while beating enemies up are hilarious. Things get better with Team Venture as they come to meet their arch nemesis that stinks at the job nobody gave him. After the first few episodes you won't be able to get enough of Venture and you'll be stalking Adult Swim for new episodes.",1141344000,4,1096,4.425742574257426
2522670,5,B000EMGIDC,"This warped take on the old Jonny Quest adventures features some of the best comic book/sci fi/action adventure hilarity you can imagine. I've been waiting a year for this DVD set to finally come out and it's finally arriving. Sit back, keep the kids away and enjoy. For Adult swim fun, you seriously can't beat the Venture Bros. The voice acting, animation, music, stories, you name it, all 5 stars.",1140912000,105,400,4.728571428571429
2522671,5,B000EMGIDC,"The first thing I'm going to say is this: although this is a cartoon, it is most definitely not for kids!  The Venture Bros. deals with a lot of adult situations, and it can get very vulgar and graphic at times.  Having said that, this may be one of the best new cartoons I've seen in a long time.

I was never really a big fan of Adult Swim; until I got to college, the only show on the block I had seen was Futurama, which debuted on FOX.  While I still don't like overall, it does have its gems, such as Cowboy Bebop (best anime ever!), Aqua Teen Hunger Force (when it was in its prime), and The Venture Bros.  The Venture Bros. is a show that most heavily parodies Johnny Quest, though it also draws from Star Wars, DC and Marvel Comics, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even Kafka's The Metamorphosis.

The plot is as follows; Dr. Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture is the son of Dr. Jonas Venture, one of history's greatest inventors and adventurers.  Jonas built up a successful science industry and led a team of heroes known as Team Venture.  Unfortunately, Rusty was never able to live up to his father's image.  He never completed college (thus the fact that he calls himself a doctor is called into question a couple times), and he is pretty incompetant at most everything he does.  Most of his inventions don't even work, and when they do, they always malfunction.  He is also a pill-popper who suffers from dreams involving his dead father and a weird flashback to his mother's womb.  However, he is a genius compared to his two sons.  Hank and Dean Venture redefine naive.  Even though they see themselves as cool and brave, they are anything but.  They get squeamish around violence and are easily scared, yet they are always clamoring to go on new adventures, in which something always inevitably goes wrong.  Fortunately, the three Venture men are protected by CIA agent Brock Sampson (voiced wonderfully by Patrick Warburton, who played David Puddy in Seinfeld and was The Tick in the live action series).  Brock is basically an unstoppable man-beast who defies the laws of physics and biology to keep Dr. Venture and his sons safe.  Other Venture allies include Dr. Byron Orpheus, a sorceror who tends to speak in an overly dramatic voice (even when warning others not to use a bathroom due to his choice to have Taco Bell for lunch) and his daughter Triana, who is kind of a goth/punk and is embarassed by her dad very often.  Dean has a crush on her, but she finds the Ventures pretty silly.  Dr. White and Master Billy Quizboy are two other allies who help out Dr. Venture from time to time.  Dr. White is an albino while Billy is a vertically challenged genius with an oversized head.

On the villains side, Dr. Venture's archnemesis is The Monarch, a man who was raised by monarch butterflies after his parents died in an accident.  He too is incompetant (seems to be a running theme in this show); he doesn't really have any ""powers"" per se, besides his weak weapons he built into his suit, and his henchmen are morons.  The best twist though is that while The Monarch considers himself to be Dr. Venture's greatest nemesis, he has no reason to (Dr. Venture barely realizes that he exists).  In this sense, I like to attribute The Monarch to The Joker; in a sense one can't exist without the other, or at least, that's how things would be if Venture actually paid attention to what was going on around him.  The Monarch is dating Dr. Girlfriend, a woman who dresses like Jackie O. and probably has the deepest voice on the show.  The other main villains include Baron Werner Underbeit, a Dr. Doom-esque villan who blames Venture for a lab explosion that blew off his jaw, as well as Phantom Limb, a man whose arms and legs are invisible.

Most of the episodes involve the family, Brock, and H.E.L.P.eR (the Venture's robot) going on some sort of misadventure, where Brock basically has to bail everyone out by the end.  That's not to say that the episodes are formulaic; each one is very unique and very hilarious.  For example, in one of them, Dr. Venture holds a yard sale in order to raise money, only to have a bunch of villains show up and create havoc.  In another, the family goes to a theme park run by a Walt Disney lookalike who tries to get Venture to clone him.  And in one of my favorite episodes, The Monarch is put on trial, and the opening scene is priceless (MECHA SHIVA!).

A lot of the show's humor is derived from the sheer bizarrness of the situation; most of the adventures are beyond impractical, and knowing how limited the abilities of the Venture family are, one has to wonder why they don't just give up.  There is a good amount of parody, but the show doesn't overdo it (the way too many shows and movies are doing nowadays).  And there are some very dirty jokes thrown in for good measure.  As I said, this is not for kids.  It is somewhere between a PG-13 and an R in terms of rating (they can only go so far because its TV, but there are times when, if it hasn't crossed the line, it is walking it).  I think that at times, its even dirtier than Family Guy (and much funnier).

The Venture Bros. is not for everyone; the humor is for a very select group, and there are some scenes that are extremely disturbing and disgusting.  However, it is a hilarious show that deserves a look.  You're only hurting yourself by not checking it out.",1140220800,168,5384,4.486652977412731
2522695,1,B000EMGIDC,This is not a review of the content of Season 1 which to me is top notch. This is not a new item as stated. One of the disc has multiple scratches on it and the 2nd disc has scratches as well.  Buyers beware many products listed new are not. This looks like it is used. The disc holder keeps the disc off the package inside so there is no reason it should have so many scratches on it. I purchased this item from Mighty Silver so just beware if you are expecting a new item from this vendor.,1494288000,,491,3.95959595959596

Younger viewers may not know who Johnny Quest was, but older fans will appreciate the very hard south turn this spoof takes with the idea, not so much the characters, of this one-season take on another action hero, Jack Armstrong. The Venture Bros. is just great fun, and when I am able to, I will purchase more seasons! Watch a little of them on YouTube, then decide for yourselves if this isn't just the screamin'est cartoon series you have ever seen! And don't forget the Villains! What great action series would be complete without a perfectly-matched set of evil super-villains to upset the everyday, normal life of not-so-normal scientists and their entourage?

2522851,5,B000EMGIDC,"Don't get me wrong, I love the entire show all four seasons. The 5th season is slated for 2013 release as I type this and I am certain that will be good, could be better if the producers see the downfall of season 3 and 4. But the first season is absolutely the best 'Venture' experience. Still makes me laugh, the episodes have the most atmosphere about them. They also have plenty of references to classics and the best humor.

There is no familiarity at this point in the show during season 1 and even season 2 is still ok,the Venture family is dysfunctional to a point of mild believability. Later they go so dysfunctional it's schizophrenic, which that word sums up seasons 3 and 4. By then the show ran almost completely on inside jokes and references and a tangled web of various inter-character relationships that seem to go nowhere or serve no purpose. There was barely enough humor to keep the show going at that point.

Gotta sum this up: If you caught any of the Venture episodes and at least laughed a little, get the first season. It's not too expensive and it's the best season and guaranteed kicks. From there decide if you like the show enough for Season 2, which is still pretty good. Past that Season 3 and 4 you really have to be into the show to keep going.",1340928000,,1278,4.411016949152542

To really appreciate this series you'll be best served having a working knowledge of comics and cartoons at least.

2522871,5,B000EMGIDC,"I generally tend to avoid Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block due to it's original programming. The cartoons on there are trite, unfunny, and just plain stupid. I did, however, manage to catch a episode of a series called the Venture Bros. on TV one night. With my interest piqued, I told a friend who lent me the first season of the series on DVD. I breezed through all 13 episodes of the series in 3 days. By the end of the last episode, I was hooked.

The Venture Bros. is a TV series about a man named Dr. Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture, who grew up from a plucky boy adventurer to a pill-popping, failed superscientist doomed to forever live in the shadow of his more-successful father. The series tells of Dr. Venture's misadventures with his two sons, Dean and Hank, and his secret agent bodyguard, Brock Samson, which range from fighting their archnemesis, the Monarch, to destroying any new inventions that create chaos around the Venture household. Does the basic set-up sound familiar? The series takes the superscientist/boy adventurer/superhero genre of the 60s (think Johnny Quest) and turns it upside down. This is the big draw of the series. Despite The Venture Bros. being based on shows with two-dimensional characters and paper thin, episodic plots that appease the Saturday morning crowd, the series has plenty of substance to it.

Not only are the character archetypes that you've loved as a kid turned on their heads, but they're also given these characters realistic personalities to the point where you might start caring about the characters' problems and start cheering them on. Even the Monarch, who was based on the kinds of villains that are literally powered by their hatred for the main characters and nothing else, has his villainy downgraded to comedic proportions and is made into a realistically sympathetic character (might I add that I think his girlfriend, Dr. Girlfriend, is one of the most well-crafted female TV characters within the past decade, animated or otherwise).

The story itself is as inside-out as its characters, starting off as a simple adventure series and evolving into a complex world of its own. The world it takes in contains Jetsons-style elements of the superscience 60s and combines it with modern elements. The style of humor used is mixed, ranging from witty dialogue to pop culture references. I'd also like to advise you beforehand that the creators of the show are music geeks, meaning that they put in music references whenever they get the chance. Be on the lookout for references to musical artists like Depeche Mode, Led Zeppelin, and David Bowie.

The audio aspect of the series is top-notch and some of the best I've heard from an Adult Swim program. The music by composer J.G. Thirlwell is fitting for the semi-anachronistic world that the show takes place in, mixing electronic styles with loud, adventure cartoon-inspired instrumentals. The vocal performances are lively and fun to watch and listen to. Some stand-out performances include James Urbaniak as the snarky Dr. Venture and Patrick Warburton as Brock Samson, the role that finally convinced me that Warburton is a really good voice actor. Some of the voice actors on the show even take on multiple roles. I think I counted 4 or 6 roles for one actor. The creators of the show, Jackson Publik and Doc Hammer, carried most of the vocal weight of the show as well as displaying some of the widest vocal range in the cast. The actors, along with the characters themselves, are the heart of the series.

Simply put, I love this show. It's one of television's current underrated gems, and aside from the first two episodes of this season, each episode presents a hearty serving of laughs. It's a witty, well-written action/comedy with a touch of that raunchy Adult Swim humor fans of the block have come to know and love. If you ever get a chance to watch the series, take it. It'll be worth the time as well as the money. As for me, I've hopped on this cult hit's bandwagon and now consider myself a fan. Go Team Venture!",1274313600,2,4045,4.839595375722543

I have to say that The Venture Bros goes above and beyond any expectations I had about it. I saw my first episode at a friends house and was hooked ever since then. I went home and bought all the seasons right away.

I have been told that apparently The Venture Bros is supposed to be a Johnny Quest type of spoof, but I cant personally say anything about it because Ive never sat through Johnny Quest. What I can say is that I loved every episode of this show. The main characters are a lot of fun and make it easy to laugh with (at?) them. The episodes are very random, but I think that is part of the charm of the show. And surprisingly there is actually a plot to be found inside the randomness. There are many characters in this show to fall in love with and they each bring their own uniqueness, personality, and dynamics. I especially love what the Dr. Girlfriend and The Monarch relationship brings to the table.

And on a final note I just wanted to say that Brock Samson is one of the coolest cartoon characters ever created.",1246147200,,1132,4.334905660377358

For all that the series is named ""The Venture Brothers"" the two adults Dr. Thaddeus S. ""Rusty"" Venture and Brock Samson are far more interesting characters.

The first season does I think get off to a slow start but it builds slowly and if you stick with this season (and two and three) it you will be entertained.  If you don't like Brock, you'll like Hank if not Hank then Dean and if you can't laugh at Dr. Byron T. Orphus I don't know if there is any hope for you.

2522890,5,B000EMGIDC,"Review of ""The Venture Brothers--Season 1:""

Without a doubt the most intelligent show (animated or otherwise) that has been released in awhile.

The Venture Brothers is a witty and sarcastic parody mix of (but not limited to) Scooby Doo; Johnny Quest; Mission Impossible; all of the cartoons and culture of the 1960's and 1970's; G.I. Joe; James Bond; NASA Space Programs; references to the 1980's; contemporary social culture; Marvel and DC Superheroes; etc., etc.

If you grew up in the 1970's and 1980's you will absolutely relate.  Without sounding obtuse, you will either ""get it"" or you will not.  My opinion is that if you do, you will love it.

Each episode is about 21 minutes or so long and are for the most part, stand alone.  These are not cartoons I would suggest for children as they have a distinctly vulgar and adult sense of humor to them.  The last episode had a bit of a surprise to it, however things were explained in the second season.  Patric Warburton does the voice acting for ""Brock Samson"" and does it extremely well.

2522908,5,B000EMGIDC,"I was always a fan of Johnny Quest as a child (the original cartoon, not the awful remake). The Venture Brothers series is funny enough on its own, but if you have any knowledge of Johnny Quest or are a follower of comic book heroes, you'll enjoy this show.

The bad guys are all colorful characters with strange quirks, yet they are often put into ""average Joe"" situations. For instance, Dr. Venture's neighbor has a skull for a phone answering machine, which he uses to leave a message for his daughter to tell her she can help herself to pudding that's in the refrigerator. It's so far out there it is hilarious.

Other regular villains include The Monarch, Dr. Girlfriend, and the Phantom Limb. The Limb has invisible arms and legs, which engenders some predictable jokes -- yet they're still funny.

A caveat is in order: the episodes tend to deal with adult content (i.e., sexual innuendos and occasional language), so this is not a cartoon for children.",1216252800,,960,4.7023809523809526

The Venture Brothers is an extremely edgy adult comedy. The characters are fleshed out to a greater degree than in most live action dramas. The level of caricature is on par with early Mad Magazine. The writing is similar to some of the more extreme post-underground comics put out by Fantagraphics. The cinematography and cutting are highly cinematic.

The scene in the pilot where Brock mows down the henchmen in his car reminds me of something out of a Jack Hill Pam Grier vehicle or even a Russ Meyer movie! In fact, I think they should get Charles Napier to play his estranged father.

In general, at it's best, TVB takes the Johnny Quest formula of a movie a week, and turns them in to 60s/70s drive-in movies. This, to me, is pure gold.

Season two has gotten more hit and miss, with Brock going soft, too many animated pseudo-celebrity cameos, and many episodes degenerating to actionless soap operas. But even those episodes are pretty good. And some of my favorite episodes are from the second season. It's just more hit-and-miss.

I commend Adult Swim in green lighting something as subtle, dark and edgy as TVB often is. The main sources of comedy tend to be themes like failure, insanity and death! Even if you don't get all of the references, it's a good show. I will buy the third box set the second it hits the shelf!",1194652800,2,1526,4.6162361623616235

With all the crap on TV nowadays, Adult Swim seems to be on the cutting edge of innovation and creativity. I'll admit there are many of their shows I don't personally find funny, but when they hit the mark they hit is well. As you watch these shows and get to know all the characters better, the laughs really start to pick up. The animation is excellent, but the script and voices are where the genius comes in. The characters subtle and outrageous lines at rapid pace with their completely distinctive voices makes this show a classic. Hopefully Adult Swim will keep up the good work. Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law is another high recommendation as it parodies a multitude of Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters.",1192579200,3,869,4.686274509803922

I love cartoons (even at my age!) but rarely consider buying any for fear of tiring of them quickly. That has yet to happen with this and/or the second season of ""The Venture Brothers."" It's simply brilliant satire and great fun. The extras of the creators and cast dressed as some of the characters they to whom they give voice is fun (no sign of Patrick/Brock, unfortunately, anywhere except in the episodes themselves), the deleted ""scenes"" are just draft storyboard images and are thus not very interesting. The only negative I have to report concerns the episode commentaries (not every episode has a commentary, but you won't mind --trust me on this!). They suck. The guys (the creators) are obviously not into it, are bored, and are making the best of a chore-like situation. I have yet to make it through all the commentaries as I really don't find the guys' personal interchanges to be of any interest. Occasionally, one reminds the other they are supposed to be talking about the show, of which they do very, very little. Nonetheless, I do love the show in spite of the disappointing commentaries; I'm glad to have this and season two (and three when available)in my collection, regardless of any commentary.",1186358400,4,1394,4.836820083682008

Obvious althought this is a cartoon, it is NOT for young children...but at some age (when they can understand it all), even kids (teens) would really get a major kick out of it.  It has some vulgarity, so if you are one of those people who live in a ""bubble"" and cannot handle curse words (even on occassion) then I would pass.  But for those that live in the real world, and accept that cursing can add emphasis to comedic timing (even if you don't curse yourself) then you will enjoy this series well (assuming it is your type of humor....sort of a Mad-magazine meets Justice League meets South Park sort of thing (not nearly as much swearing as South Park though).

2522929,5,B000EMGIDC,"Quite possibly the most brilliant cartoon spoof EVER created (and this coming from a foaming at the mouth fan of Aqua Teen Hunger Force) and unquestionably the BEST send-up of all the `60s and early `70s Hanna-Barbara ""serious"" cartoons.

If you liked Johnny Quest as a kid, you'll LOVE the Venture Bros.

If you watched ANY of Hanna-Barbara's slap-dash piss-poorly animated abominations like the Herculoids or Space Ghost (the original series not Cartoon Network's Space Ghost Coast to Coast) you'll roar yourself horse with laughter at the misadventures of the Venture Bros.

Want proof?

Ok.

One name, Patrick Warburton (Seinfeld's Puddy) as Race Bannon knock-off Brock Samson.

Brock Samson is the ultimate spy/secret agent clich.  He mocks not only cartoon characters such as the aforementioned Bannon but James Bond, Matt Helm, John Steed and every other spy/secret agent character ever imagined.

Samson's only ""official"" weapon is his oversized hunting knife but he can be seen wielding as weapons everything from his 1969 Dodge Charger to a lawn mower.

And don't get me started on the villains.

First is the Monarch a rich, obsessive-compulsive, emotional wreck whose only purpose in life seems to be ""arching"" (as in arch enemy) Dr. Venture, though no one knows exactly why.

Baron Underbheit ""a dimestore Dr. Doom"" (so says the Monarch anyway) whose jaw was somehow (its unexplained thus far) removed due to the action or inaction of Dr. Venture.

And finally the Phantom Limb, a sophisticated, power-mad floating torso (actually his limbs are invisible, again though how this happened has yet to be revealed) Englishman who doesn't ""professionally"" hate Dr. Venture but who ""really"" hates him personally.  These and other ""villians"" transcend inspired.

Hell even the infrequently recurring characters like Master Billy Quizboy and Pete White the albino scientists are comic gold.

As to plots and adventures, just recall the kinds of plots and adventures of Johnny Quest.  If you haven't seen or are unfamiliar with Johnny Quest a good bit of the show will be lost on you.  Sorry.

In a departure from the more serious fare I've been reviewing of late I've taken a hiatus from the historical and wanted to pen a review of a show who's episodes I can watch over and over again.

2522933,5,B000EMGIDC,"This is quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen.  It is certainly the best thing to come out of the whole Adult Swim crowd.  Even better than ""Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.""  To appreciate the Venture Brothers, you probably need to be a male who grew up in the 60's.  This show satirizes and parodies nearly everything I grew up with.  There's a hard edge to the humor, and yet underneath it all is a sort of indulgence, too.  You get the feeling that these guys love the things they're mocking;  they remember the 60's fondly instead of bitterly.

The first episode, one of the funniest, brilliantly sets up the series and the characters.  Just seeing the sign, ""Community College of Mexico at Tijuana"" was enough to tell me that I'd better sit up and pay attention because this was going to be good.  Somebody with my sense of humor was at work.

When I first saw the episode about Michael Sorayama I nearly choked to death from laughing.  Man, they were really firing on all cylinders.  But all of the episodes are terrific...every single one.  Another favorite is the one that starts with Brock tearing into some kind of ancient pyramid guard, a stone giant who delivers the unforgettable lines, ""My arm came off.  I can't believe that happened!""  As Brock uses this unfortunate creature's own arm to hammer its groin, the Venture brothers gleefully call out with each stroke, ""Stop hitting yourself!  Stop hitting yourself!""  The creature begs for mercy:  ""Ohh!  I am *so* sorry!""  I have to avoid thinking about this kind of stuff during business meetings because I always burst out laughing.

Everything here is top-notch.  The story ideas, the scripts, the animation, the voices.  This stuff is so good that I don't think I can finger more than maybe three or four very brief segments in the entire season that seemed...not bad...but maybe not up to par with everything else.

2522938,4,B000EMGIDC,"If you have the right sense of humor, the Venture Brothers is an incredibly funny show.

It has to be a sick, slightly warped sense of humor, but it's funny.  The arch villian has a right-hand woman and sweetie by the name of Doctor Girlfriend.  She looks like Jackie Kennedy, always glamours and attractive, and has a deep gravelly voice more suited to a truck driver than any woman, much less a pretty one.  The conversation where she starts, ""When we got together, we decided we were two people who weren't interested in children..."" just broke me up.

Theoretically about two young men, Hank and Dirk Venture, the show also includes their fatuer Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture, and their body guard Brock Samson.  If this combination sounds familiar, and you recall Johnny Quest, you will apparently get more out of the show.  (They even kill Race Bannon in one episode.)  It's funny even if you don't have the references, though.

The reason this isn't a five star review is that the DVD extras are extra-cheesy.  For one of the extras, the voice actors dressed up as the characters for some ""interviews"".  In another, they give a silly tour of the animation process.  These were mildly amusing.

Some of the episodes have commentary tracks, which are terrible.  The two creators rambling on about things mostly unrelated to the show and and asking each other which of the characters they'd have sex with was a complete waste of time.

But besides that, the dvd extras really make the purchase worthwhile. It includes extensive commentary for the episodes, the bonus Christmas episode, the original pilot and a whole slew of random extras in which the creators dress up like the characters they voice.

2522961,5,B000EMGIDC,"The Cartoon Network is known for its kooky Adult Swim programming, with everything from ""Robot Chicken"" to winged superhero lawyers.

But few cartoon shows can match the level of comic brilliance of ""The Venture Brothers,"" which unabashedly spoofs ""Jonny Quest"" and other kiddie adventure fare. It's loaded down with hilarious writing, aspiring supervillains, adolescent humor and the most dysfunctional family ever to fly a superjet.

It's about the adventures of Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture, a has-been child genius who is still overshadowed by his adventurous dad's legacy. And he now has two dim teenage sons of his own, Dean and Hank (""Go Team VENTURE!""), as well as the nurturing robot H.E.L.P.eR. And finally there's his knife-wielding, lusty mullet-haired Swedish bodyguard Brock.

In the first episode, the brothers are kidnapped by the Monarch, a second-rate villain who desperately wants to be Dr. Venture's nemesis. Meanwhile, Dr. Venture has had both kidneys stolen, and Brock is apparently dead -- but he won't let a little thing like that (or the chupacabras) keep him from rescuing Hank and Dean.

In the episodes that follow, the Venture Brothers bravely (and stupidly) deal with the minions of the Monarch and steel-jawed Baron &Uuml;nderbheit, a crazed Walt Disneyesque mogul, their friendly neighbor necromancer, a broken space station, ghost pirates (both real and fake), testicular torsion, secret twins, yard sales, murderous robots, and a date gone wrong -- Dr. Venture ends up turning into a giant caterpillar.

There's also two extra episodes: the pilot, where thw twins get lost in NYC while a ninja tries to steal Venture's latest invention. And then there's the Christmas special, in which the Monarch riddles the Venture compound with explosives -- and a nasty Christmas spirit crashes the Christmas party to punish the wicked.

A series like ""Jonny Quest"" is just asking for a spoof, and ""Venture Brothers"" happily obliges. But in fact, it also mocks the Fantastic Four, Sean Connery, Christmas specials, and Germanic villains -- basically all unrealistic action-adventure. Where else can you find a villain's henchman arguing who would win in a ""crazy fantasy fight-fight between Anne Frank and Lizzie Borden""?

It's full of adolescent gross-out humor (porta-potties), gory action (wrestling mummies and alligators), and the odd sex scene for Brock. But the genius is in the scripting, which is often crazy and unabashedly sarcastic: ""With every fiber of my being I stab at thee, as long as blood flows through this heart I will hunt you down. I will be the stuff of your children's nightmares!"" ""What's he doing now?"" ""He's making his dramatic exit.""

Patrick Warburton and James Urbaniak are simply brilliant as the indestructible Brock and the embittered Venture, with Michael Sinterniklaas as the naive Dean, and Christopher McCulloch doing many roles, most prominently Hank and the whiny-voiced Monarch. And Steven Rattazzi gets a special mention as the melodramatic necromancer/single dad Dr. Orpheus.

""The Venture Brothers"" have exactly the kind of adventures that kids dream of NOT having, but for the grown-ups, it's a hilarious animated comedy. GO TEAM VENTURE!",1166832000,,3201,5.3353174603174605
2522962,5,B000EMGIDC,"I was already going to get this at the normal list price, which was around 20-30 dollars, but I saw it on amazon for 8.99, and it was a complete steal (Especially with no tax or shipping fees).

The Venture Bros. is an amazing series, which is somehow random/bizzare, laugh out loud funny, and yet serious with a flowing plot.

The action in the show is great, the storylines are spectacular, and I can't get enough of it. I haven't seen a television series this entertaining in AGES.

After every episode, these thoughts run through my head:

""Awww it's over already? That fast?? I gotta watch the next episode!""

I sat down for 3 hours watching them with my girlfriend before I had to go to work, and the show is simply genius.

Brock (the bodygaurd) makes some hilarious face gestures, too. I can't help but laugh at them.

It's hard to find words to really describe the greatness of The Venture Bros., but I strongly reccomend anyone that can find humor in the dirty things of life (Viewers of South Park, Family Guy, Aqua Teen Hunger Force), to pick this up ASAP.

I can't wait for Season 2.",1166745600,,1096,4.472361809045226
2522963,5,B000EMGIDC,"I don't want this to be a long and drawn out review (but it will probably end up that way) so I will give you the bottom-line up front: If you like things that are awesome, buy this DVD now. I guarantee (barring large-scale stupidity of course) that you will enjoy this, and it's only $8.99, come on, you can afford that. This is probably the fourth best animated comedy show I've seen on television in the last ten years (behind South Park, The Simspsons, and King of the Hill). And given that this is the golden age of animated satire that's one heck of an endorsment. Also given the current state of the Simspons, and certain less-inspired South Park episodes, Venture Bros. just might be the most consistently funny show on-air as well. That may sound like an overstatement but in an age where Family Guy rules the hearts, and dare I say minds?, of idiots everywhere it's nice to see an animated series that actually focuses on a specific cartoon genre (instead of pop culture in general). And what genre deserves spoofing more than animated 60s action shows? But be warned, this is a surreal adventure, they kill the actual Race Bannon in the third episode for godsake, and that's just a taste of the weirdness to come. The scripting is good on whole, and it is truly inspired in some cases. The animation is so much better than the normal Cartoon Network fare that is is almost hard to compare Venture Bros. to anything else without feeling like it's wrong, it's simply out of everything else's league (just watch the opening-sequence and you will know what I mean). But what really holds the series together is the voicing. James Urbaniak and Patrick Warburton are absolutely superb as Dr. Venture and his six-foot Swedish murder-machine/bodyguard Brock Samson. But the true find among the voice actors on the show is creator Jackson Publick (the alias of Christopher McCulloch). Publick's fantastic work as the villainous Monarch (Dr. Venture's arch-enemy)  and as the more masculine Venture twin Hank is simply astounding. Most of the time when creators lend their voicing talents to their shows the results are fair bordering on poor. In South Park and in Family Guy (sorry to group those two) you can always tell who Trey Parker or Matt Stone or Seth McFarlane are voicing (but it's okay in South Park because that's part of the joke). Conversely I had no idea until after I had already finished the first season that Jackson Publick was both the Monarch, Hank Venture, and a myriad of other characters, he's just that good. Thank you Jackson Publick and thank you Doc Hammer (the show's other creative half) for providing us with some fantastic work. I hope to god that Cartoon Network realizes what they have on their hands.

Each voice actor is highly talented which makes the characters not only believable, but also likable.  Dr. Venture's intonations and off the cuff crass witticisms rarely miss the mark.  The boys really are just boys.  I want to be Brock Sampson.  There is not a character on this show I dislike.  I'm excited to see new ones introduced because they have allowed so much room for the stories to grow and develop.

2522974,5,B000EMGIDC,"I have been an Adult Swim viewer since Space Ghost CTC's early days. The Venture Brothers is probably my favorite of them all (The Brak Show was a riot also). I am in my 40's and so I can relate to all the jokes on the stuff I grew up on (Marvel, DC, Johnny Quest, Scooby Doo, etc). The formula started with SGCTC taking mundane kids 60's-70's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references (many homosexual), uber violence for violence's sake, profanity (beeped out but you know what they are saying), well you get my drift (think excrement jokes). It's Ted Turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi American of good vs. bad in cartoons, and screwing it all to hell. But despite the same formula over and over (SGCTC, Harvey Birdman AAL, The Brak Show, Robot Chicken, Aqua Team Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and probably some others I missed), I still watch and laugh, with The Venture Brothers being the best of them all. One thing that I really laugh about is that the teens and gen X'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from, they are just laughing at the situations and don't get the parody. I tried to tell a co-worker (whose 25 years old) about a Robot Chicken bit about Hogan's Heroes and he never heard of that show!

2522977,5,B000EMGIDC,"By now i'm sure you all know that on the surface level ""The Venture Bros."" is a hilarious reimagining of the old cartoon ""Johnny Quest"".  But as you analyze it more, you begin to see many different layers of depth and care given to the characters to feed the general motifs.

But first, a runthrough of the basic plot.  Dr.  Thaddeus Venture is a mediocre(at best) Super Scientist constantly living in the shadow of his far superior father, Jonas Venture.  Venture's adult life has been scared by utter failure on both the scientific and personal level.  He has two sons, Hank and Dean, of questionable origins(no mother has ever been introduced, nor has the fact that the boys were even conceived via conventional methods confirmed).  Their body guard, the burly Brock Samson(voiced perfectly by Seinfeld's Patrick Washburn), has dedicated his life to the protection of Dr. Venture and the Venture brothers.  Together with allies ranging from Necromancers to midgets to latently homosuxual albinos, Team Venture faces off against the likes of The Monarch(the showcase villain, a man dressed in a butterfly costume), his female companion Dr. Girlfriend, Baron Werner Underbheit, and Phantom Limb, not to mention a barrage of ghost pirates, chupacabra, mummies, and killer panda bears.

But ghost pirates aside, what the show is trying to get across is that as the world changes, even our idea of fantasy changes.  In the age in which these characters grew up, there was always the brave, noble hero eager to do battle with the maniacle, costumed villain.  One represented good, one the other evil.  The fate of the world(or galaxy?) always hung in the balance.  But now, in our day and age, such fantastic situations are too far fetched for even children to believe.  There is no longer a place for super heroes or their arch villains.  So here we have a cast of people, displaced by the world, trying to carve out an ever so small niche for those still in the business of building robotic walking eyes or wearing a butterfly costume and wreaking havoc.  And thus the stage has been lowered considerably.  The Monarch doesn't seek world domination, all he seeks is the domination of his mortal enemy, Dr. Venture, and in return, Venture hardly recognizes his existence.  He does not use his infinite wealth to build nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage...he builds floating cocoons in the grand canoyn in which to stew away, plotting the demise of the Venture family.  And dear Brock...Brock is a relic of a forgotten time.  He is the perfectly trained CIA killing machine.  His awesome force is only surpassed by his awesome mullet.  He shuns the use of guns and forgoes strategy in favor of brute force.  But these days, the CIA has little use for such an agent.  As denostrated in the episode ""Mid-Life Chrysalis"", in which Brock loses his liscense to kill, he contains non of the qualities admired now in an agent, but he is kept on board, if not out of loyalty for his past efforts.  Demoted as far as he possibly could, a body-gaurd for a scientist no one in their right mind(ahem, the monarch) would want to kill, Brock clings to the Venture family as he clings to the wolrd he knew spiralling ever further out of focus.

So these characters continue on, displaced by time, re-enacting situations that have no relevance in the world in which they live, in order to keep from simply fading away.",1158019200,4,3407,4.801029159519725

What can be said about Venture Bros. that hasn't been said before?  Its basically the funniest show on tv right now.  The funniest tv show I've seen in years.  Essentially a smart, sardonic, hipsterific, geektastic comedy geekfest; an endlessly inventive gonzo-transgressive parody of Johnny Quest  and other action cartoons of the 60s and 70s that also, oddly, manages to be both hilarious and exciting (gotta love it when the ridiculously hyper-manly testosterone-fueled Brock clears the room of men in butterfly suits, ninjas, mummies, or tries to castrate giant living statues; all the while covered in blood and screaming; then later on talking about how much he loves Led Zepplin and a russian superspy named Molotov Cocktease).  Then theres the Doctor Strange inspired Doctor Morpheous who declaims all of his lines in a booming voice dropping with gravitas while a bombasticly grim music cue blares in the back ground -- ""DON'T GO IN THERE!  I had TACO BEELLLLL for lunch!""  Yeah, this is pretty much a must-buy for fans of avant-retardo subgenius style wackiness.

Did I mention that Jim ""Foetus"" Thirwell supplies the soundtrack?

Its basically the greatest thing in the world.  Go buy it.  BUY IT NOW!",1156550400,9,1621,5.067924528301887
2522981,5,B000EMGIDC,"I have heard, here and there, that this is a spin off of 'Johnny Qwest', which despite my age I don't know much about, although I do remember it. Venture Bros. is one of the smartest animated television shows to come along in some time. It is broadcasted exclusively on Adult Swim, an evening lineup of animation geared towards an older audience on The Cartoon Network.

The main characters are Hank and Dean Venture, teenage brothers and sons of Dr. Venture. The brothers are a bit simple minded and naive having been schooled by their father at Dr. Venture's compound inside of ""learning boxes"", designed by Dr. V. They are full of enthusiasm for the adventures that their father and his bodyguard, Brock Sampson, find themselves in and think they are much more capable and helpful at ""solving mysteries"" than they really are. Very good intentioned they are easy characters to cheer for and sympathize with.

Dr. Venture is sort of a failed super-scientist living under the shadow of his very successful father in the same field. He finds his sons a bit of a nusence because they aren't very bright, but Hank and Dean never catch on to this attitude an accept their father's slightly uncaring behavior with open-eyed innocence.

The good Dr. has a house guest that rents a room in the enormous compound named Dr. Orpheous, a highly intelligent necromancer , with a British accent, that has magical powers and helps Dr. Venture through many tough situations. The Monarch is a consistent arch enemy of the Venture's and is always trying to cause them trouble. As a child he was abandoned by his parents and was brought up by Monarch butterflies, so as an adult he dresses like a butterfly and lives inside a flying cocoon.

Always being bothered by so-called arch enemies, Brock Samson a Level 8 United States Secret Intelligence Officer, and former assassin, with a liscence to kill is completely dedicated to protecting the Venture family, which has really become his own. Cool and calm, Brock delivers some of the funniest lines in the show.

Although an animated series, this is not really appropriate for kids under the age of 14. This is geared for adults with sarcasm, adult themed humor and many social, political and historical jokes and references that younger kids would most likely not catch or understand. Despite it's sarcastic, vengeful and sometimes violent content this a VERY funny series. The balance of the way out personalties and the constant battle between ""good and evil"" actually make the jokes that much more funny! The more I watch, the more I love this show! With the new season still on TV from time to time, and soon out on DVD, the two seasons are tied together perfectly and we learn a lot about the first season from the Season Two. It makes it even better. Clever writing, unique characters and a sinister sense of humor make this and outstanding animated series.

The Season One DVD contains basically the 13 episodes with very few extras, but it's well worth it. If you want something refreshing, intelligent and different take a chance on The Venture Bros. Season One, there is nothing else like it!",1155945600,2,3136,4.798148148148148

I was never much of a  JOHNNY QUEST fan and spoofing it at this late date struck me as dubioius at first, but the characterization and humor are on a par with STRANGERS W/ CANDY: smart, irreverant and hilarious. The show is ultimately it's own entity with a sprawling sub-culture of bizarre villains and allies fleshing out the cast as the Season One progesses. The four  principlle characters are choice: The scientist dad in  is a horrible selfish nerd, his teenage sons are feckless wonders and their bodyguard Brock, (Race Bannon by way of Doc Savage) is so heroic he is a borderline psychotic. My favorite running joke is that the two title characters are utterly dead weight in pretty much every show, which doesn't dampen their clueless enthusiasm.

Even if it's the white album, Blonde on blonde or Nevermind the bollocks you're going to find at least one prick who's given it one star and titled his review 'dis is stoopid lol' or something. At my time of writing this review out of the 70 reviews I looked at, not one ( as far as I saw ) was below a 4 star rating, this should give you an idea of what a rare and exceptional thing this series is.

 As much as I like most of the shows on Adult swim I find alot of them are quite contrived and 'Oh look how adult and/or alternative our humour is' so I didn't hold out much hope for this show, 'oh a spoof of Johnny Quest, very edgy' but then I watched it and was blown away.

 To say Venture bros is a simple spoof of Johnny Quest is an understatement, it's also a damn funny, original and really exciting show in itself. As much as it will make you laugh ( and it will, 'til you cry blood if you're anything like me )this show is also a genuinely exciting action series, rather than just being a spoof of those early morning cartoons you watched as a kid it's more of a version of those cartoons you can enjoy when you're old and bitter like me.

 I find myself actually caring about the characters which either shows how amazing this is for a 'spoof' show or how incredibly sad I am ( probably both ). Every character, even down to the henchmen of the badguys has a truly interesting personality and intruiging backstory like you'd find in any classic graphic novel that's been going for fifty years and has had to come up with reasons why that one guy has blue fur and so on.

Most of the DVD extras are disappointing though.  The deleted scenes seem awfully familiar--there's maybe a line or phrase in each that wasn't in the final scene.  And ""Behind the Scenes of the Venture Bros. Live Action Movie"" and ""Animating Hank and Dean"" are just dumb.  I really really wanted them to be funny but just couldn't even bring myself to crack a smile.  It's not all bad though.  The commentaries are great (even though only 5 episodes have them) and the watercolor illustrations inside the DVD jacket are super cool.

2523015,5,B000EMGIDC,"At first I was offended at the very idea of poking fun at my number
one show ""Johnny Quest"" But after one viewing on Adult swim all was
forgiven and I was instantly hooked. The show is hoot from beginning
to end credits. Story concerns that of Dr. Thadaus Venture(son of a
famous '60's scientist) now a middleaged washup with 2 teenage boys
Hank and Dean and thier Body Guard Brock Samson.  The show is great
mainly because no stone is left unturned as it not makes fun of but
takes us back to remind us of what we grew up on with a wakeup call
of reality. Spoofing everything from Johnny Quest & Fantastic 4
(Ice station impossible) to Dr. Doom & Sorayama bots(Past Tense)
Most of the comedy comes from the more colorful characters such
as Baron Wunderbite,Quiz Boy,Dr. White,Phantom limb & of course
the ever flamboyant Monarch who as menacing as he thinks that he
is, The Ventures don't take him seriously as a threat at all and
his side arm Dr. Girlfriend who dresses like ""Jackie O"" is great
The precredit widescreen effect of each story shows the creator's
love for what he's representing. My favorite episode would have
to be ""Trial of the Monarch"" who's Mecha shiva opening shows the
writing team's craft at full trottle with ""Past Tense"" close 2nd
The Venture Bros. dares to go where other toons dare not tread.
Some of the humor is violent and not for every taste but if you
like animation with a little edge then look no further.(and for
those still unsure the second season just started)

listed as Venture Christmas Special,Deleted scenes,Pilot episode

2523017,5,B000EMGIDC,"I won't restate what the well-written reviews here already have, and fans don't need any encouragement.

This is for the readers who have never seen this show, and maybe sitting on the fence wondering if it's worth it.

Folks, it's worth it.

The Venture Brothers is one of those rare treats that satisfies my fix for really good parody.  If you weren't a kid in the 60's or 70's who watched the same dozen reruns of Jonny Quest year after year, you may not appreciate how dead-on funny the premise is, and all the cliches being skewered.  The important thing is that you don't have to be.

The reason you should try this DVD, and the reason you'll like it, is that it's a well-executed labor of love by the creative team.  This is a show that excels in its writing, and in the voice talent that brings those lines to life.

The writing is very, very sharp.  I will echo the point that this is NOT for kids, so use some judgement, parents.  What won me over with this show is the voice talent.

James Urbaniak does a masterful job as ""Dr."" Venture, dancing between the arrogant/glib/authoritative image he wants the world to see, and the neurotic/insecure son of the brilliant, heroic father he could never live up to.

Patrick Warburton is perfect as Brock Sampson.  He's strong, assertive and confident in his reputation as a former government agent and current Venture family bodyguard, while occassionally showing a tolerant soft side for the boys, given how they're (not) being raised by their father.

Doc Hammer provides many great characterizations that fill out the show, the best being Dr. Girlfriend.  Other memorable supporting characters are Dr. Orpheus, a takeoff on Doctor Strange whose appearances have to be heard to appreciate, and the henchmen of the Monarch.

The best part of the show for me has been every single appearance of the Monarch himself, voiced brilliantly by Christopher McCulloch.  This is one of those special cases where a gifted actor takes good lines, and creates something really special in their delivery.  There's no point in trying to explain this any further - check out any episode he appears in on TV, and know that the DVD will deliver more of the same.  My hope for the show is that this wonderfully over-the-top character will be used in measured doses in seasons 2 and beyond, but if not, you'll always have this season 1 DVD to enjoy the creators getting it right.",1150761600,4,2414,4.704761904761905
2523018,5,B000EMGIDC,"The show is just flat out funny.

The DVD's have a good transfer and look and sound great. The bonus episodes - the pilot and the Xmas Special are certainly worthwhile. The commentary tracks are the only major disappointment to the set. They are, in a word, useless. They guys doing the tracks are having fun but not telling you anything interesting about the show.

I highly recommend this set to any fan of the show.",1150761600,3,418,4.4868421052631575

2523020,5,B000EMGIDC,"A satire of Johnny Quest and many other action and adventure (including super heroes) genre archetypes. The writers pushed the envelope and avoided the homogenous and sometimes tedious kithen sink approach of ""Family Guy.""

  For awhile there, Adult Swim, the Cartoon Network's late night line-up, had some intelligent (intelligence is relative) offerings. The Venture Brothers was the best of the draw. They still run Aqua Team Hunger Force, which I also grew to admire, Futurama, which manages to stay one step ahead of banality, the well written Justice League and the newer black-humored Oblongs. Robot Chicken was the dullest product they came up with in my opinion. I don't really get Manga Anime, too slow paced or cutesy for my taste, so I only watched the shows I listed above.

  All that being said, The Venture Brothers are re-watchable for the many subtle jabs at convention and in-jokes, I like the animation style as well. Totally recommended to all except the narrow minded and literalist who might not recognize the art of it.",1150416000,,1043,5.0

However, I'm going to rain on the 5-star party here by docking the DVD set one star for the disappointing commentary.  There's not much discussion of what's going on in the show - the commentary is mostly self-indulgent mutual admiration.

And why wasn't the Rocky Horror theater sequence (one of the few bits of interesting commentary) in the 'Deleted Scenes""?

2523038,5,B000EMGIDC,"I can't figure out why I seem to be one of the few people who thinks the Venture Bros. is one of the funniest cartoons to appear on Cartoon Network.

It is a spoof on the ""Superscientist and His Family of Adventuresome Heroes"" genre. Instead of being the pre-eminent superscientist, however, Dr. Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture has been, in the words of one character, ""riding his father's corpses' coattails for 30 years.""

Basically, he's not a very successful superscientist. In fact, he's more adept at getting himself kidnapped, which is why he has Brock Samson, his blonde, rage-prone bodyguard.

His kids, Dean and Hank (who I maintain is a spoof on Freddie from Scobby Doo), are more interested in irritating one another than anything their father wants, and the family is completed by H.E.L.P.E.R., a robot who never once lives up to his name.

Aside from Brock, the Venture clan is pretty much a sad lot, which makes it difficult for The Monarch, Dr. Venture's arch-nemesis, to really hate him properly.

""Here I am, in the belly of the beast, and I don't even care,"" the Monarch says when he sneaks into Venture's laboratory in one episode. ""I don't even want to take a whiz on this... I used to DREAM of taking a whiz on this!""

Essentially, the series is about a bunch of marginal superheroes and supervillains with modern concerns and problems.

One of the best episodes involves Dr. Venture's tag sale, where, natch, he is selling used atomic death rays and other assorted superscience weaponry.

There is a lot of low-key, but hilarious humor throughout the whole season. I love it, but judging by the reaction from a lot of my friends, I guess it's not for everyone.",1148947200,45,1676,4.755172413793104

If you're even vaguely familiar to the Adult Swim format, you know this is a cornerstone - buy it, if just to continue funding for whatever WS/AS has next for us. Plus, it's Wharburton! Nailing yet another role.

A personal favorite.",1148774400,5,645,5.294117647058823
2523040,5,B000EMGIDC,"sure this is a freaking funny cartoon, great characters, plots and animation but what got me was a reference from the monarch accusing dr. girlfriend of hanging in a hot tub with james foetus. the music for this show is done by none other than j.g. thirwell, aka foetus, the industrial music mastermind himself. this proved to me that the venture brothers excels on all levels of creativity.",1148688000,5,391,4.764705882352941
2523041,5,B000EMGIDC,"Holy. Damnit. Christmas.

""Ghosts of the Sargasso"" hooked me with it's opening dialogue lifted right from David Bowie.  They had me at hello.",1148601600,3,141,5.086956521739131
2523042,5,B000EMGIDC,"The concept of this show, which is an obvious nod to Johnny Quest, is one of the freshest in years. A Super-Scientist can apply to the Guild of Calamitous Intent for an Arch-Enemy who comes complete with henchman. This is a prestige thing and not just anyone gets granted, (although they do tend to link up half rate scientists with half rate arch enemies). The characters are deep enough to get interested in, the plots are as silly as they are ironic and toughtful. Patrick Wharburton is fantastic as ""Brock Samson"", Dr. Venture's bodyguard who belongs to a secret branch of the government concerned with protecting the super-scientists from their assigned arch-enemies, (Race Bannon of ""Johnny Quest"" also belongs and makes an appearance in one of the episodes). There are plenty of unanswered questions in the series such as the origin of the boys, Hank & Dean. Were they cloned? Was there a mother? Questions that may never be answered as the writers have fun leading us along. I have been watching since the premiere and am so looking forward to the second season.",1148342400,2,1070,4.820652173913044
2523043,4,B000EMGIDC,"This show is almost comedy to me. I suprise after the first season [adult swim] didn't decide to cancel the show instead it's good enough to have a second season airing in June. Also I can't believe it's good enough to have season one on DVD. I can't believe the box only has two disc it must be a short season. The Venture brothers are the sons of Dr. Venture who is a scientist. The two guys live in a 60's world. I'm glad they put this on DVD.

I'm ready for these other [adult swim] shows to come to DVD: Stroker & Hoop, Perfect Hair, Moral Orel, Minora-Team,",1146787200,3,563,4.165137614678899

2523045,5,B000EMGIDC,"Numerous people have described this show in detail, and probably in a better manner than I could. Just know that the Venture Bros. is leaps and bounds ahead of Family Guy or South Park (both of which I tend to enjoy). No other cartoon can capture you like this one... whether it's the stupidity of Hank and Dean, the Monarch's antics, Dr. Orpheus' dramatic voice, or (my personal favorite) Brock's murderous eye-twitching rampages, the Venture Bros. is 101% hilarity. I'll be picking this set up as soon as it's released - I can only hope Season 2 will be on par with the first.",1145923200,10,578,4.5673076923076925

I can best describe ""The Venture Bros."" with six words:

""'Johnny Quest' gone horribly, horribly wrong.""

2523047,5,B000EMGIDC,"I don't know how I found this show, but am I glad I did.  This loose parody of Johnny Quest has more laughs per episode than any whole season of ""Yes, Dear."" Tousands of highlights, here's a few I can think of: ""6 Million Dollar Man Steve Austin's"" loving relationship with Bigfoot, any of Brock Samson's rage-fueled killing sprees, all of the episodes' cold opens, the Venture Industries garage sale, and that Christmas Special--holy christ is that one funny.  It's just a great show.  And this is not that weak Cartoon Network crap like Harvey Birdman, etc.,--this is Futurama/Simpsons (heyday) quality humor.  Tightly scripted, hilariously brought to life with pitch-perfect voice talent, this show is a gem.  Note: It has been renewed for the fall.  Can't wait.",1145923200,3,765,4.984251968503937
2523048,5,B000EMGIDC,"The Venture Bros. is quality television in a way that mankind rarely sees these days. While most cartoons rely on a consistent formula of the same jokes and storytelling, Venture Bros. evolves and unfolds much like a great novel that you just can't put down. It helps answer questions such as ""What would it be like to live nextdoor to a professional necromancer?"", ""What's the everyday life of a butterfly-winged villain when he's not being evil?"", and mostly importantly, ""What would happen if I were to throw a yard sale and invite all my arch nemeses?"" Watch it and be hilariously hooked on every character's unique persona. You'll find yourself praying for your favorites to make an appearance while a Johnny Quest-esque overdramatized theme catapults you into a hysterical and witty universe. Once you watch a few episodes, you'll have to see the rest; once you reach the season finale, you'll be clawing at your television for more.

Yes, it's that good.",1145664000,5,961,4.932098765432099

2523051,5,B000EMGIDC,"I caught the Ventures Brothers on Adult Swim quite by accident.

I was hooked the moment I heard The Monarch say, "".. Grover Cleveland's presidential time machine..."". I watched every episode I could find afterwards. At the time I did not have a DVR so I downloaded all the episodes I could get. That having been said I am totally getting this DVD. I will gladly shell out the duckets to keep this show on the air.

I am looking forward to the second season and cant wait to see what Team Venture gets into this year. Plus, the show features the music of Jim Thirwell as Steroid Maximus. Absolutely brilliant and a must see.",1142812800,9,624,4.417391304347826
