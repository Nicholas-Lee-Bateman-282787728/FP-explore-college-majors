I was pleasantly surprised that the video is 7 hours long with so many artists being interviewed. As posted by another reviewer, the  videos is more about their philosophies rather than a how to video. Nevertheless, having access to all these master craftsmen in one package is wonderful. The video is very informative and inspiring with quite a number of their work being showcased. Highly recommended",1382659200,,528,5.057471264367816
8089412,4,B000BNMX06,"I was looking forward to watching a woodworking technique, how-to collection.  I quickly realized that this series is about the artists, not how-to.  It would be on A&E rather than on the HGTV.  However, there are a few techniques shown. It is interesting to note that different philosophies, create different approaches to the lathe, and produce very different work. Perhaps, this is the point of the series.  I still found it very interesting, and enlightening, although it was different from my expectations. High production values!",1234051200,5,535,5.258823529411765

8089415,5,B000BNMX06,"I found these CDs by accident and I was introduced to a beautiful art that seems to be known only by specialists when lots of pieces are already acquired by the museums all over the world. The masterpieces are shown very elegantly and you have plenty of time to appreciate their technical quality and their beauty. The artists are interviewed by a real connaissor in that special art and we see them at work. You learn, you discover and you fill up your eyes with beauty.",1141689600,5,471,4.488372093023256
