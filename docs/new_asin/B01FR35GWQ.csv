&nbsp;One overall Crown prosecution case extends over 8 episodes. So, so good to see Marta Dusseldorp (A Place to Call Home) in a leading role for another Aussie series. I expected greatness with Marta leading this new series. And got it! She plays a senior Crown prosecutor in a contemporary Sidney setting. There are at least 12 of the cast taken from the 2011 series Crownies. Crownies is an endearing term given to young Crown Solicitors working in the DPP (Department of Public Prosecutions) in Sydney. Expect to be shocked.

&nbsp;Janet King, Senior Prosecutor, is tapped to lead an Australian Royal Commission looking into major gun crime. It is 2  years after the events in her life (Series 1) of which she yet struggles. The Commission is established in a West Sydney suburb. There is mystery and thriller, love and violence, a story as big as the country itself. This series tackles a complex cluster of highly controversial & political contemporary issues. Issues seen in countries worldwide. Is it really fiction, or storylines taken from media headlines? The story is powerful, gripping, and vested with emotion. 8 episodes in one continuing story of many facets.

Marta Dusseldorp is a phenomenon; leading in 3 different dramatic series at one time in 2016. Here shes in legal, in another a cop (Jack Irish), another a Jewish nurse (A Place to Call Home). All are top shows down-under (check them out-youll be glad you did), or should we say UP-and-OVER when Marta is acting? Always an award-worthy strong female character performance. Add to that, she becomes an associate producer for this 2nd series, WOW. She attracts powerful supporting casts as well.
Martas a Down-Wonder-Woman.
