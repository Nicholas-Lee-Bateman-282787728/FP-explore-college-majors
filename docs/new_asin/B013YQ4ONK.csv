8729210,5,B013YQ4ONK,This was great...the best I've seen so far but I am new at this walking thing. I felt I was right there and got a good idea what a morning walk through the city would be like. I think I could watch it several times without getting bored. Highly recommended. Also the pace was good for my walk.,1517097600,,293,4.068965517241379
