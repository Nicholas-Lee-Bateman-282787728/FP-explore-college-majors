198761,1,1583500561,I saw this video just one time. Then after I gave it my mam. She is 68year old. I think this video more helpful to older woman or people who needs to move after disease. I was very disappointed.,999475200,3,194,4.0
198762,4,1583500561,"I've used this DVD for the intention of unwinding, streaching out and centering.  I don't expect to get a super fat burning workout from this dvd.  It's perfect for in the morning if your back or neck is stiff.  It's very controlled and meant for beginners, people with injuries, or people with medical conditions that keeps them from doing all out, break your neck, pilates moves such as the ""jacknife"".  So don't bash it if you didn't get sweaty doing it...that's not it's purpose.",1151539200,3,483,4.714285714285714
198763,2,1583500561,"Well, I agree with a lot of the comments people had here, one thing that wasn't brought up was that the flow from exercise to exercise wasn't there. One minute, she's doing a standing routine, the next second, she's on the floor and doing the next exercise. I found that quite distracting and unhelpful. The best Pilates workout video is Winsor pilates.",1128643200,,353,4.709677419354839
198764,5,1583500561,"I like physical activity, but I never thought Pilates was for me -- a 50-something who prefers free-style dancing to precise exercises.  BUT -- I found the teaching on this DVD to be enjoyable, calming, and nurturing.  It's just right for those of us who want an effective workout, but aren't exactly the over-achievers of the yoga mat, and need encouragement.  You finish the workout feeling physically stronger and emotionally nurtured under the steady, patient and positive teaching of Lynn Robinson.",1122422400,4,503,5.185185185185185
198765,5,1583500561,"I agree with most other reviewers that this is extremely relaxing, good for rehabilitation, and not that difficult.
This tape got me back into exercising after a break and an injury.  It is even better than my yoga tapes for being reminded of good positioning to avoid neck strain.  The reminders about good alignment carry over to other more difficult workouts, so I return to this tape once in a while for that benefit alone (and get the relaxation mixed with toning/lengthening to boot!).",1083542400,2,491,4.833333333333333
198766,5,1583500561,"I've been doing the Weekly Workout for about six weeks now - I'm a middle-aged bookworm, had never found an exercise program that I could stick with.  I started this program not for weight loss, but for stiffness and muscle-tone, and it's amazing.  I sleep better, I wake up with no stiffness, I can feel my posture improve day by day as I sit at a desk at work.  This is *not* an aerobic workout, but that's what I like about it.
The instructor explains everything very clearly, the slow movement is very meditative, and the relaxation segment is a great finish.  If you're a beginner, like I am (although some of the exercises have advanced versions), who hates to exercise, this is the perfect workout.",1056067200,9,705,4.571428571428571
198767,5,1583500561,"Can I first say: ""I love Pilates."" I am just at the start of reshaping my body, but already I notice so many changes and my husband also has noticed and likes the fact that I'm talking care of my body and fitting into smaller outfits.

It is fun to go buy smaller clothes after years of trying all sorts of exercise programs and never seeing dramatic results this soon. I have also changed my diet and I think that also helps quite a bit.

Since I started Pilates again this year, I already dropped two sizes and that makes me feel really good about my future. Now I look forward to shopping where before I had started to really dread looking for clothes that would fit well, let alone look cute.

If you have already learned all the Pilates exercises, you might be slightly disappointed when purchasing this workout. This is for beginners and I would recommend this for age 40-60 or for when you want to relax. I am 35 and find this to be more of a ""relaxing"" workout. There is no stress on your back and this workout literally helps me get to sleep fast. I feel very sleepy and relaxed after doing any of the workouts late at night.

The music sounds like the ocean and you hear waves and subtle tones which lull you into a serene state. The exercises are not done quickly and that makes you feel that you are not getting a good workout. That is what the other reviewers seem to be complaining about.

Really, what happens is you don't feel stressed doing the workout and then while you are walking around the house, you notice your posture has changed and you feel a deep sense of relaxation and peace. This is what it is all about. This is not an aerobics, get stressed, feel the pain type workout. This is a ""feel good"" workout. If you want a ""faster"" workout, I'd recommend ""Winsor Pilates"" of ""Pilates on the Go."" Still, this workout also has its place in the Pilates world.

I think this was created for people who have had injuries or are looking for an exercise program which does not strain the lower back. With that in mind, you will notice a caring attitude through and lots of detailed explanations you won't find in most workouts.

Lynne Robinson is the world's top-selling Pilates author and her ability to teach and explain the details shows. She takes her time explaining all the main exercises and the principles behind this method of working out. You really focus on the breathing and positioning.

By the time you have done the Body Control and Weekly Workouts (three sections), you have a new understanding of the basics of this holistic approach to exercise.

The first day I did just the Body Control workout and then the next day I did the entire 75 minutes of the three workouts called: Weekly Workouts. I think anyone in normal health could do all 75 minutes. However, you can just do 25 minutes if you wish. It depends on how fast you want to see results.

Body Control includes: Principles of Pilates, Before you Begin, Relaxation Position, Lengthening away from Strong Center, Knee Circles, Stretch the Ham Strings, Stretching the Hip Flexors, Shoulder Drops, Neck Rolls, Side Rolls, Pillow Squeeze, Spine Curls, Standing at Ease, Floating Shoulders, Pole Raises, Waist Twist, Tennis Ball between Ankles, Roll Downs, Curl Ups, Curl Ups with Towel, Oblique Curl Ups, Static Spine Stretch, Pelvic Roll Backs, Pillow Squeeze, The Star, Diamond Press, Heel Kicks, The Cat, Rest Position, Single Leg Stretch, Double Leg Stretch, Ankle Circle, Stretching Inner Thighs, Feet Mobility, Arm Openings, Relaxation.

Weekly Workout includes: About the Program, Alignment, Centering, Breathing, Workout 1, 2, 3, Relaxation.

Relaxation - includes a few minutes of deep relaxation. Lynne is on a mat surrounded by votive candles. Nice relaxing segment.

Most of the time you will be on a mat flat on your back, but there are also standing exercises and she even uses weights. You will need a mat, small cushions, pillows (so comfy), ankle weights, a scarf, a tennis ball and rolled towel. You don't really have to have a tennis ball, but it does help with some of the exercises. She also uses a bamboo pole, but you could use an old broomstick. Good thing I had one in the garage.

The exercises are built around the principles of relaxation, co-ordination, alignment, stamina, concentration, centering, breathing and flow of movement. You are working the deep architectural structure of the body and rebalancing your muscles. You will notice the changes in your posture and strength within a few weeks. You will start to feel better after the first session. Your flexibility will increase and you will just start to feel good all over.

I would recommend this particular Pilates workout for:

Anyone who is new to exercise and wants to try pilates.

Anyone who wants to learn some unique moves. There are exercises in this workout I had not seen before, and rather enjoyed.

Anyone recovering from injuries which would not appreciate aerobic type exercises.

Those wishing to prevent and treat osteoporosis.

Those who are under a lot of stress and suffering from tension type headaches.

Anyone who enjoys quite evening workouts to help them wind down into a peaceful calm. This really will knock you out. I mean, it will relax you so much, you will
want to go to sleep.

I don't recommend this workout for early mornings. I did the second three workouts in the morning and almost couldn't get going even with a big cup of tea. It is just too relaxing for the morning. Maybe walk on the treadmill in the morning, and do this workout in the evening.

Gentle Controlled Movements for a Relaxing, Simple and Deeply Effective Workout.

198768,3,1583500561,"I recommend this workout series for beginners only.  From my own experience, I've been using The Method Precision Toning with Jennifer Kries (which is EXCELLENT), I was looking to add more to my pilates library.  Unfortunately, I hadn't checked these reviews first and bought this DVD blindly.
Lynne Robinson does an excellent job of explaining proper positioning for the exercises.  She is very thorough, however, this can be excruciatingly SLOW if you're already familiar with pilates methods.  Hence, I recommend highly for beginners.
One other thing, she uses many props.  A scarf, a tennis ball, a towel, small hand-weights, etc...  For me, personally, if I have to go searching around the house for these props, it steals my momentum of wanting to exercise.  I prefer the simplicity of pure matwork which requires only a mat, or if no mat, even just the floor!
Recommended for strict beginners, and those with limited range of motion, and master's athletes.  If you are of intermediate or advanced pilates level, look elsewhere such as anything with Jennifer Kries.",1045612800,16,1071,5.114942528735632
198769,5,1583500561,"I bought this video 4 years ago while in London, before Pilates was even heard of or popular in the US.  Lynne focuses on what Pilates is about - the deep muscle movements and development of the inner muscular structure - very different from the imitations now on the market which are basically just aerobics calling themselves Pilates.  If you do the exercises properly, you will see results almost immediately, without suffering muscle strain, etc.  I could tell it worked - I did it even throughout pregnancy and that baby just flew out due to the strong muscles I created.  It may be annoying to some since the movements are slow, but this is what Pilates really is - the slowness is what really builds the muscle tone and definition!",1036454400,16,738,4.653846153846154
198770,2,1583500561,I am rating this at two starts because the movements were way to slow and to few to get a real workout for the average person.  If they had merely advertised this as a Pilates training video for the Elderly or maybe for people going through rehabilitation I would have scored it much higher.,1029369600,,291,4.388888888888889
198771,1,1583500561,"I really, really, really wish I'd read the reviews before I purchased this DVD.
I have been doing pilates for about 18 months, have attended classes, read books and through other DVDs(Denise Austin and Jennifer Kries).  I just felt like a change from what I've been doing, which was why I bought this DVD.
The reviewer who said this DVD was for complete beginners was absolutely right.  The DVD contained some of the exercises that my teacher had us do in the first 1-6 lessons, to ensure that our allignment was correct, and as stretches.  So, for someone who's never done pilates before, this is quite a good DVD, but not challenging for someone who's been doing pilates for a while.  Lynne does explain quite well which muscles you should focus on and gives good tips to ensure that you're doing this.
Overall I was really disappointed - if I'd read the reviews before I wouldn't have bought this DVD - it's definitely not a challenging pilates workout.",1014163200,11,956,4.6726190476190474
7799407,5,1583500561,"I've been doing this workout for many years off and on. I purchased this as a replacement for my old DVD that was wearing out.  Some may think this workout is too easy, but it is designed to give results without straining the body. If you do the weekly routine twice a week, you will have great results in a short time. I have an old back injury and this workout helps keep me out of pain and tightens my muscles and my core.  It is designed to teach you how to integrate the breathing with the exercises while doing the positions correctly.  The exercises are done slowly, but provide a great benefit.",1480896000,,602,4.3097345132743365
7799408,5,1583500561,"This DVD is a godsend! I had been doing intermediate pilates for a year and when i got this DVD, I discovered I was doing a lot of the moves wrong. Lynn really explains well on how to properly breathe and move your muscles. funnily enough, after a month of these smoother and slower workouts, I have seen a significant difference in my midsection, even though I don't even break a sweat. This is a super investment, and I'm desperate to find more DVDs for this awesome lady. I also have scoliosis, and this has really helped manage my daily pain.",1446336000,,546,4.415841584158416
7799409,5,1583500561,"I've had the two VHS tapes of this for years.  Lynne Robinson is just brilliant.  She guides each exercise w/breathing, navel to spine in a way that the beginner can follow easily.  I've had back and knee problems and her style of Pilates is very easy on the back and knees.",1428883200,,274,4.333333333333333
7799410,5,1583500561,"enjoying this workout.  it goes pretty slow paced, but as I am recovering from some surgery, it is just the right pace.  attention to details.",1385942400,,142,4.64
7799411,5,1583500561,This is a fantastic tool for learning Pilates the right way on your own. It is excellent for those with excessive weight or health problems.  I would recommend it to everyone.,1380672000,,175,4.645161290322581
7799412,5,1583500561,"This is pilates as it was meant to be: relaxing and powerful.  I go through these deceptively simple workouts feeling as though I'm not doing anything much BUT when I'm through, I notice immediately that my posture is better.  The next day, muscles I never knew I had are sore!  This is the kind of exercise regimen that is easy to commit to and can be kept up for life.",1354147200,,370,4.257142857142857
7799413,5,1583500561,What a great Pilates workout.  This is one of the best for restoring function to the body.  I use it everyday to help with Scoliosis (and posture).,1246233600,,147,4.407407407407407
7799414,5,1583500561,"I recommend this video for anyone who craves a mellow workout with lots of relaxation.  It's a shame some of the reviewers bashed it.  I'm currently suffering the effects of too much Power Yoga (Bryan Kest).  And I've never found the ""break your neck"" Pilates (as another reviewer perfectly described it) to be very pleasant OR effective.  For the first time in ages I actually feel good after working out.  The relaxation I achieve with this video is amazing...almost better than a live Yoga class.  I alternate using this video with walking and a bit of light body sculpting.  This seems to be a perfect program for me.",1220659200,,621,4.694444444444445
7799415,4,1583500561,"Lynne does an excellent job explaining the foundations of Pilates.  This is not a typical ""workout""  DVD.  She emphasizes alignment, breathing, and working from the inside out.  Her instructions are easy to follow and her tone is soothing and encouraging.  The intermediate or advanced practitioner will need a more advanced workout.",1175126400,,333,5.450980392156863
7799416,5,1583500561,"This DVD is a tremendous value, something for everyone.

There are 34 separate short & specific exercises which you can choose from,  and several longer workouts (maybe 15 minutes) if you have a little more time.

The production of this DVD is clear & easy to follow,  and the instructor's personality is upbeat & inclusive.",1173744000,,324,4.836363636363636
