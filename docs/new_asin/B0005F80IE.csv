You see how they lack nipples, but feed milk through their bodies like perspiration.  Of course, they show the echidnea, as it is the only animal with things in common with the platypus.  They speak of the venom that males have.  However, I would really like to know why only males have it.  Is this a tool that they only use to fight each other?  I think it is stated that it wouldn't make humans feel good, but it would not kill them, unlike many poisonous snakes and frogs.
