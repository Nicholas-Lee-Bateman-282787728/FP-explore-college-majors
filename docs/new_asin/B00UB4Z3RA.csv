I like how the film showed that she's just a normal human being who is exhausted from working at times and she gets sick and has emotions just like us. I love the interviews I think they picked a good handful of ones where it shows that she has some insecurities like moments where she gets panic attacks on meet and greets. You'd never know because she's just so real and such a honest person. I love how she is so honest and she isn't like no I can't say this or act like that because I'm a celebrity. Some of the videos on the interviews are really loud and some are very low. I gave the film five stars because I loved the way Demi responded to questions. I think people should definitely watch this DVD especially if their a fan or just wanted to know who she truly is as a person.",1484784000,2,1010,4.158163265306122
