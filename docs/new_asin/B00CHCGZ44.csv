8581726,5,B00CHCGZ44,"Sa'diyya knows her stuff, and this DVD shows her talent and skill beautifully.  She is charming and charismatic in how she instructs, and her style is real and full of joy and passion for the dance.  I found this DVD helpful and fun, and think dancers at all levels can take something positive from this DVD.  Definitely worth adding to your dance library :)",1432080000,2,358,4.5625
8581727,5,B00CHCGZ44,"This is a really great DVD that covers the ""putting it together"" that is often lost between class levels and DVDs. I have been a beginner for many years and decided I finally wanted to move up to the next level. I found that many of the transitions presented here made a lot of sense, but I wouldn't have necessarily have thought to do them myself.

The video takes you step by step through a routine then shows you how to ""spice it up"" and make the moves flow by adding small transition moves. It is not a DVD of isolated move combinations, you are doing a choreography for most of it.",1429574400,4,586,4.232142857142857

8581729,5,B00CHCGZ44,"I'm still pretty new to dancing, I like how the instructor emphasizes her movements, they are easy to see and emulate.  I think this is a video I could go back to as I improve and still continue to learn more advanced technique",1406764800,2,227,4.27906976744186
8581730,2,B00CHCGZ44,"If you can, find this DVD on line and see if you can see snippets of it before you purchase, wish I would have done that before I purchased it.",1401926400,3,143,3.8
8581731,5,B00CHCGZ44,"Exactly as the other reviewers have said, from basics to beyond advanced, this dvd has it all. A must buy",1395273600,5,105,4.3
8581732,5,B00CHCGZ44,"I'm a dance teacher with over a hundred students.  This gal, who I have never heard of, has made one of the best DVD's I've ever seen.  My students love the material.  Wowza.  Often when you buy a video you wonder if it was worth it.  With this one, you'll wonder how you can make use of all of the good material.  I never write video reviews.  Run, don't walk, to go buy this one.  It'll have you dancing like a pro.  Kudos, Sadiyya.  I hope to congratulate you in person one day.",1376179200,23,481,4.075268817204301
8581733,5,B00CHCGZ44,"Nice DVD. Choreography may be better for those who are beyond beginner level. However, the concepts presented are appropriate for all levels. Sa'diyya is an awesome teacher and does a good job explaining how to use transitions to add character and dimension to your dance.",1374364800,13,272,5.066666666666666
8581734,5,B00CHCGZ44,I really enjoyed this video. I appreciate how the concepts were explained and applied in the lesson plan. I also enjoyed learning the basic movements and then learning the movements after the concepts were applied. This instructor is a wonderful teacher. I recommend this video to everyone. I think all levels would enjoy it.,1372896000,16,325,5.037037037037037
