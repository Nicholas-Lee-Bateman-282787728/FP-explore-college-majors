8268911,3,B00189CZO6,"This DVD has a Kickboxing and a Hi/Lo workout on it.  I didn't like the Kickboxing workout, so I would only rate it 2 stars.  I enjoyed the Hi/Lo workout, even though it was very easy. I give this workout 3 stars.  That's why I rated this DVD 3 stars.

KICKBOXING WORKOUT

The positives:

*The music was good and made me want to work out harder

*Tracey's teaching style of doing a move slowly so you can really focus on your form.  You then do the moves faster to get your heart rate up.

The negatives:

*Endless repetitions of a move.  You do 4-8 repetitions of a combination before moving on the next side.  You then do 32 repetitions for each side.  You then go back to the first side worked and do at least 8 more repetitions. These give the workout a big dread factor for me.  The drills weren't all that fun to begin with, so having to do them a lot of times made it worse.

*Uneven routines.  For most of the routines, you work one side, do the endless 32 repetitions, and go the other side for the same.  For some of the routines, you then go back to the first side and do some more, repeating this on the second side.  This wasn't the case for all the routines.

*Lack of intensity.  I respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers that you can make this workout as hard as you want.  I did the routines with 2 pound weighted gloves and gave it my all.  I still couldn't get my heart rate up in the aerobic zone.

This workout wasn't fun for me, so I rarely do it.  I rate this one 2 stars.

HI/LO WORKOUT

Even though this is a very easy workout, I love doing this on days when I want something not too intense.

The positives:

*The Latin flavor of the music.  This isn't normally my favorite kind of music, but it's fun for a change.

*The dance-like feel to the workout.  I didn't think it was too hard to pick up the moves.  Plus, they were fun to do.
The negatives:

*This is a very low intensity workout.  I wear weighted gloves to try and up the intensity, but it's still easy.

I recommend this workout for those wanting something around 35 minutes long that's fun and different, but not too intense.  For a low intensity workout, I'd rate this 3 stars.",1304985600,,2182,4.211165048543689
8268912,4,B00189CZO6,"I'm not sure why this isn't more popular.  As the previous reviewer said, it's split into two parts:  Kickboxing and Hi-Lo.  I admit that I only do the kickbox portion of this DVD, but so far, it's my favorite DVD for the hard days when I can't get to the gym or go for a run.

Kickbox:
Tracey Staehle pushes you, but in a motivational way, rather than Jillian Michaels' tough and sometimes condescending manner.  Her instructions are clear and most of the Kickbox moves are simple, but effective.  There is one combo that usually leaves me turned around, but after about my second time watching the DVD, I felt like I really got it and now I can perform it with very few slip ups.

For those of you with the common complain that a workout DVD isn't hard enough, you really get what you give here.  If you aren't punching hard, kicking high, and squatting as low as you can, you won't feel it as much.  I'm an intermediate, possibly advanced, exerciser, and I always feel like I had a good workout after the kickbox portion.

That said, watch your knees with this one.  I dislocated my left knee several years ago and I still have issues with it sometimes.  There are times when I can't push myself as hard as I'd like with this DVD when I'm really feeling it, and there are some days I won't do it at all because of it.  I won't tell you not to get it if you have knee problems, but you might want to save it for one of those days when your knees aren't acting up.

Hi-Lo:
The Hi-Lo portion left me standing clueless as I watched the screen.  Admittedly, I've never tried Hi-Lo before, but I thought there would be some instruction to help me along my way.  Well, there wasn't, really.  Occasionally I'd feel like I ""got it"" and try to join in, but I ended up turning it off and saving it for later.  My feelings are that if I'm going to have to sit down and watch it first to ""get it"" I might as well be learning a style of dance and not sometimes cheesy aerobics moves.  So far, I still haven't tried it again.

I'm guessing Hi-Lo is kind of like Zumba or Step Aerobics where you feel lost until you know all the steps and then you can feel the benefits. I wish there was some sort of breakdown of the moves.  Instead, the DVD is split into sections where you can play and then manually rewind specific combos over and over again, but it would be so much simpler to have a separate section that breaks down the moves.  For that, I'm reducing my final rating by a star.  If I could, I'd give it a 4.5.

Final thoughts:
Although this is one of the pricier exercise DVDs out there, I feel this DVD is worth it simply for the kickbox portion.  I have fun while doing it and it's a great workout.  I suppose it really depends on how hard you like to workout.  I think it's obvious from the title that if sweating makes you cringe, it's not for you.",1264291200,,2846,4.202952029520295
8268913,5,B00189CZO6,"Cardio Sweatfest, led by relative fitness newcomer Tracey Staehle, is actually comprised of two workouts, a 60-minute kickboxing routine and a 36-minute Hi-Lo section. Either of the two workouts can be selected from the main menu; this will lead you to submenus which include several premixes for each workout.

Kickbox Sweatfest is a drill-style kickbox workout. For the most part, Tracey keeps the combinations quite simple, starting slow at first but kicking up the pace and intensity as you continue. Tracey uses some different terms for some of the moves--eg, back fist/reverse punch, which she also calls temple-sternum--but these are broken down in the ""Kickbox Demo"" segment featuring Jessica, a martial artist. The workout begins with a 3.5-minute warm-up which starts slow and then incorporates some of the punches and kicks to stretch. For the main body of the workout, there are 8 total combos, each about 6-7 minutes long; with the exception of a few jump kicks, the moves are mostly low-impact, with one of the background exercisers always showing modifications. As mentioned above, each combination features basic choreography (eg, jab-cross-jab-kick), but Tracey mixes things up a bit, sometimes repeating just the kicks or punches at a faster tempo. Following the combinations, there is an additional 7 minutes of arm drills and 3.5 minutes of kicking drills--you definitely will be fried by the end of these! Tracey finishes with a 4-minute cool-down which includes push-ups and some brief stretching for the lower body. The premixes include Shoulder Shredder (19 minutes), Butt Blaster (19 minutes), and Short Sweat (35 minutes; features Combos 4-8).

The Hi-Lo Sweatfest workout has a *slight* Latin flavor but also includes more traditional hi-low moves such as grapevine and some kicks as well. There is a Hi-Lo Combos submenu which features at total of 9 combinations. Unlike in the kickboxing workout, however, these combinations are not stand-alone; rather Tracey teaches this workout in an add-on style with frequent instructions to ""take it from the top"" and repeat all of the moves. I found the choreography to be a bit trickier here (and Tracey's cueing to be less effective), but given the high number of repetitions, I was eventually able to at least approximate all of the moves. The 4-minute warm-up introduces the opening sequences and also includes some brief stretches. All of the exercises are done up to tempo from the first time around, so your heart rate definitely stays up. In addition, at about the 13-minute left mark, Tracey does a long (4 minutes) jumping jack sequence that is intended to get your heart rate up even further before running through the entire routine one last time. The 6-minute cool-down is led by one of the background exercisers, Donna; it features some of the same choreography as the workout plus some of the moving stretches from the warm-up. The premixes for the Hi-Lo workout include a 44-minute version which incorporates the kickbox drills and an 18-minute combos-only series (no breakdowns).

I'd give the kickboxing portion of this workout 5-stars; the simple choreography combined with intense drills was right up my alley, although those who enjoy more complex workouts may be bored here. I've never been a big fan of Hi-Lo, but the workout here was well-done and also intense, so I'd give it 4-stars. This DVD is a provides plenty of options and is a good deal for intermediate exercisers and above; my final rating is 4 1/2 stars.",1219017600,4,3509,5.109756097560975
