4209115,1,B003VE9WU6,"I was SO looking forward to this film by Dario Argento, I love all of his film and have been a fan since I was a kid. Unfortunately, ""GIALLO"" totally misses the mark in my opinion. For those who do not know, Giallo means yellow in Italian and stands for the lurid crime thriller paperback novels that were colored yellow. A giallo in film terms means a sort of re-herring, black gloved, whodunit, crime thriller. BE WARNED, THE TERM GIALLO USED IN THE TITLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EITHER DEFINITIONS! This is not a giallo! The acting is terrible (which can be expected in these types of film...), Adrian Brody does NOTHING for the film, the story is horrible, and the fx are crappy. The ""blood"" used is of the kool-aid variety and is as thin as water. If this film were a first year film student's, it may have merit. BUT, this is from the same director who made such CLASSICS as: ""BIRD WITH THE CYSTAL PLUMMAGE"", ""DEEP RED"", ""SUSPIRIA"", ""INFERNO"", ""OPERA"" and ""NONHOSONNO"" to name just a few. If this is the type of film Mr. Argento wants to make, he should hang it up. If for some reason his hands were tied or he has some excuse for making such a piss-poor film, prove it and make a REAL FILM! I purchased the Japanese version of this film for anyone wondering how I have seen it already. I wish Dario had taken his name off of this film and not besmirched his otherwise GREAT NAME.

4209118,3,B003VE9WU6,"Giallo (Dario Argento, 2009)

Dario Argento has, over the last couple of decades, become a shadow of his former self, a parody of the director who gave us such classic gialli as Profondo Rosso, Suspiria, and Four Flies on Grey Velvet, three of the finest mysteries ever committed to celluloid. More recent efforts--The Card Player, Mother of Tears, Do You Like Hitchcock?, etc.--have been, at best, silly and derivative. Which made Giallo something of a pleasant surprise. While it is in no way up to, or even close to, the standards Argento set for giallo films in the seventies, it's some of his best work in at least the past two decades.

Plot: a crazed killer, known only as Yellow (Adrien Brody, sporting some fun facial prosthetics) because of his advanced jaundice, uses his job as a taxi driver to abduct beautiful women, take them to his basement torture chamber, and do nasty things to them. His latest victim is Celine (Snakes on a Plane's Elsa Pataky), a supermodel whose sister, Linda (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly's Emmanuelle Seigner), has just gotten into town to see her. Linda enlists the help of a New York detective, Enzo Avolfi (also played by Brody), in trying to find the killer before Celine's life is forfeit.

It has been noted in a few reviews that despite the movie's name, this isn't really a giallo. It does have a number of the hallmarks of the genre (most notably, there's no real motive for the killer to do what he does, he's just nuts), but it does come off more as a mystery/thriller with a couple of moments that tread in torture porn territory. This is not necessarily a bad thing; Argento's attempts at making gialli recently have been pretty miserable failures. It's also Argento's first feature on which he wasn't the principal writer; this turned out to be a very good idea indeed, as the script, especially the final twist (something I can't imagine Argento doing, which made it a double whammy), is markedly superior to Argento's recent efforts. Brody plays the killer very well, overacting very nicely in comparison to the brooding, mumbling detective (I've seen some criticism of Brody's portrayal of the detective, but I had no problems with him here), and while Seigner doesn't turn in her best effort, she does well enough. While you would be better served watching one of Argento's seventies classics again, this isn't terrible. ** ",1366502400,,2388,4.817073170731708

The murderer is certainly crazy enough and very well-acted.

4209120,3,B003VE9WU6,"Once considered the Master of Italian Horror, Dario Argento has since slipped into a long downward spiral of uninspired thrillers that lack the director's particular flare for the theatrical. GIALLO is no different, just another watered-down attempt to rekindle a failing career. Adrien Brody stars as Inspector Enzo Avolfi, an obsessed detective that has been charged with bringing in a sadistic serial killer who has recently kidnapped his latest victim. Each of the girls have been beautiful models and actresses, leading Avolfi to believe that his killer may have some form of physical deformity, but he will have to rely on the help of the victim's sister to find the man they call 'Yellow.' Were it simply up to the filming and acting, GIALLO may have passed as another routine (though underwhelming) thriller, however the poor plot construction is impossible to ignore. Avolfi may as well not have been in the film at all, when the real detective work is left to Emmanuelle Seigner as Linda. Brody and Seigner appear to be just as unimpressed with the script as the audience, with absolutely no range in emotion as they easily uncover the inept clues. Argento throws in a splash of blood but no sense of style whatsoever. It all leads up to the director's most anti-climactic ending ever, which is sure to enrage those viewers who sat by long enough to give the film a chance.

4209121,4,B003VE9WU6,"huge dario fan and i had heard/read alot of negative things about this movie....unfortunately for me i bought into them so i never checked this out.

first of all...how wonderful to have him behind the camera again. his directing style can never be matched. that said....the script of this movie certainly is lacking BUT it kinda is in all Giallo movies and if you are new to them it might be hard to get used to the wackiness....

his direction is stunning, the story line is a typical Giallo and good or bad...its def. entertaining. the bad guy was truly disgusting and the kills were over the top gross which is great. the leading lady was, of course, stunning and Adrien Brody was.....ummm....Adrien Brody. the true star of the show was Argento here and he did MUCH better than The Card Player or Hitchcock....all told i think it is a perfectly legit update on old Giallo movies.

there are weak parts to the movie. the script could of used some work and the acting was....ummm....strained?!?! but i can honestly say as a true Argento fan that i enjoyed this movie alot.

go into this movie with a open mind and a open bottle of red wine....the movie is really not that bad but im just truly happy to see Mr. Argento back at it....

five bucks delivered or free on netflix. ill take it. absolutely.

old fan of Argento you MUST see this...new fan id prob. start out with Suspiria or Bird with the Crystal Plummage.

although the movie prob. deserves only three stars, truly, i gave it four because it is a great first step for him to modernize the Giallo movie genre, a very tall order....and i believe he achieved success...

well done.",1354665600,,1641,4.538983050847458
4209122,5,B003VE9WU6,"I put off watching this film because of the bad reviews.  If you're a 70's Italian giallo film fan, don't put off watching it.  No, my friend, revel in it.  My take on the film is that this is a nearly perfectly updated 70's giallo in the true sense of the the sub-genre term.  It's new giallo old-stock and a must see for fans of directors like Argento, Lenzi, Martino, Fulchi, and Bava and the cinematic giallo art of the 60's and 70's.  Beautiful camera set-ups, violent death scenes, excellent Italian scenery, great music (but not as good as the Italian classics of old), beautiful women, and Brody is perfectly cast as the brooding detective.  It's violent bold chance-taking artsy schlock - just like the giallos of the 60's and 70's. The totally wacked villian is more something out of a Fulchi film, I thought, and adds that dollup of nuttiness required for the genre.  Of course, don't expect idiot film critics (who are really frustrated literary critics) who don't understand cinema - and who prefer pretentious film snob bores to artsy-exploitaion, to give it its due - or fans who have never seen a true giallo.  All the elements that make a giallo a giallo are there, including the /required/ dose of nuttiness - as is Argento's trademark style.  He pulled it off.  Bravo!  The only thing missing was a bottle of JB scotch, though I might have missed it.  I'll need to keep an eye out for it when I watch it again.",1353715200,10,1429,4.56078431372549
4209123,4,B003VE9WU6,"I don't know why this film has such a terrible rep, it is actually the best thing Argento has done in ages. Other films like The Card Player and Do You Like Hitchcock are quite wobbly, whereas here the script and direction are well in hand. My main gripe would be that at times the pacing and actions of characters seem to be a little off, but nothing as bad as in  'Hitchcock'. And once again he manages to find the best looking women - the lady playing Brody's mother is ridiculous. This is easily worth a watch, but more as a conventional cop movie with the occasional over the top bit of gore.",1349913600,3,597,4.2368421052631575
4209124,4,B003VE9WU6,"I put off seeing this film because of all the negativity involving the critics and also actor Adrian Brody in the controversy of money for services rendered.  I'm glad I finally got to see it and yes, it's no 'SUSPIRIA'-1977 but then again, we are not in the seventies anymore either.  At that time, there were no reality TV shows showing actual autopsies or histories of serial killers or Showtime's 'DEXTER' to measure up against.  Since Director Dario Argento never started out as a Horror Director per se, its fitting that he went back to his roots and you can look at the title 'GIALLO' as the name of the killer in the film or as the genre that Argento basically made famous with 'THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE'-1969 aka 'L'UCCELLO DALLE PIUME DI CRISTALLO'. All the critics seem to be looking at is a career slump but isn't it fitting that after Director Alfred Hitchcock made many masterpieces back to back that his career did the same thing?  You cannot say that 'TORN CURTAIN'-1966 and 'TOPAZ'-1969 are up to par with his best. Yes, Argento did the MASTERS OF HORROR series which had his best work in years ('JENNIFER"" still haunts me to this day) and then unleashed 'MOTHER OF TEARS'-2007, a flawed but still outrageous piece of filmmaking. 'GIALLO' is his best thriller since 'SLEEPLESS'- aka 'NON HO SONNO'- 2001 and has all the Argento qualities we know and love: beautifully edited and photographed sequences, strong women figures and jolting surprises.  Brody is joined by Emmanuelle Seigner ( Mrs. Roman Polanski) and Elsa Pataky giving our killer a run for his money. You'll also see the credit of Roy Bava as a technician on the film joining other family members such as Lamberto and the master Mario Bava to remind us of the golden age of Italian Horrors. It also harkens back to his days without rock musicians doing the soundtracks, here the score by Marco Werba is a nicely orchestrated work and reminds us of his soundtracks with Ennio Morricone.  Unfortunately, Argento went back to the Horror genre with his new 3D version of the DRACULA legend and the critics do not seem to be kind to it either.  I recommend this film to lovers of Argento's work and also to thriller fans.  Having met Mr. Argento and his woman of that time ,Daria Nicolodi, at the premier screening of 'SUSPIRIA' in New York all those years ago and seeing his energy and love for film, its great to see he is still creating excellent work, something that is lacking in the Horror hacks that are bombarding us with inferior product these days.",1347580800,6,2542,4.671140939597316
4209125,5,B003VE9WU6,"Dario Argento paints a slightly anaemic Turin which is beautiful both by day and night. Some people, like detectives and taxidrivers, seem to resent not being able to enjoy the highlife others do, and other characters include a butcher and a teenaged boy who are into stalking and voyeurism, and several models. The bloody action is often jolting sudden and prolonged, and gorehounds and Miss Marples will both feel at home with this movie. Various potential female victims look sexy in a desperate or distraught sort of way, but are not quite as scantilly clothed as in some Italian Horror. This therefore has all the main ingredients of a Giallo and because of the first half I would say it is one, but I know many would disagree. The copy I have been watching is a 16/9 regionfree Bluray. I love this and look forward to Dario's Dracula 3D in September.",1330473600,,856,4.675496688741722
4209126,2,B003VE9WU6,and it shows. Awful traipse through boredom up to a dull non-ending. Good camera work though. I watched it waiting for a twist; Giallo was Inspector's long lost brother - anything - even the ridiculous would have been more than was offered. Giallo (the villain) was painfully brody; and what was the sense in him playing a dual role with no connection to the story; couldn't they afford to hire someone else? Two stars only because I hate to admit I watched the full version of a one-star movie.,1317686400,,495,4.573033707865169
4209127,3,B003VE9WU6,"In ""Giallo"" a beautiful fashion model Celine (Elsa Pataky ""Snakes on a Plane"") goes missing after taking a taxi at night in the city of Turin. Her sister, a French flight attendant Linda (Emmanuelle Seigner, ""Frantic""), believing that she has been kidnapped, asks an Italian-American Inspector Enzo Avolfi (Adrien Brody) investigating a serial murder case, to give her a help. Initially reluctant inspector agrees, and they attempt to find the killer and Celine before it is too late.

Despite the inclusion of one Oscar-winning actor, Dario Argento's latest work, with its all-too-familiar material, needs better, more careful storytelling. ""Giallo"" suffers from slack and heavy-handed narrative, and its story is all in all dull, even as homage or adaptation of the ""giallo"" genre.

While the word ""giallo"" (meaning ""yellow"") serves, not surprisingly, as a clue to the mystery, it also refers to a subgenre of Italian films. Dario Argento himslef was a kind of founder of the tradition, together with such directors as Mario Bava during the 1960s and 70s. The genre has a set of pulp fiction-like conventions including excessive gores and violence, and obviously the director and the writers (Sean Keller, Jim Agnew and Argento) are trying to update them for modern audiences.

The concept has potential, though the end result is not satisfactory. The pace is sometimes very slow, trying to explain the obvious, or things that should only be suggested. The make-up of ""Byron Deidra"" needs improvement. For younger generation of fans accustomed to the more gruesome ""SAW"" series and ""Hostel,"" this film might be something of a disappointment, though the film is good enough to keep older fans interested.

I somehow enjoyed watching ""Giallo"" for what it is, including the (intentionally, I think) cheesy dialogues and acting, while knowing that this is not going to be a ""Suspiria."" Also, I liked the way the film wraps up.",1289606400,,1924,5.176848874598071
4209128,4,B003VE9WU6,"GIALLO

STARRING: Adrien Brody, Emmanuelle Seigner, Elsa Pataky and Robert Miano

WRITTEN BY: Dario Argento, Jim Agnew and Sean Keller

DIRECTED BY: Dario Argento

Rated: Unrated
Genre: Horror / Thriller
Release Date: 06 November 2009

`Giallo' has a duel meaning: it's Italian for yellow, and it also refers to a particular type of filmmaking in which the focus is on the crime fiction and mystery genre. Whichever definition you choose to go with, both suit the new Adrien Brody thriller, Giallo.  A guy with a rare skin virus that causes his skin to turn yellow is kidnapping and brutalizing women in Italy.

The sensational Adrien Brody stars as Inspector Enzo Avolfi. He's an American who has moved to Italy to dedicate his time to hunting down killers who prey on the innocence of women. His back story fuels this passion, and rightfully so.

Our crazed killer is a hideous man both physically and spiritually, who lures attractive young models into a taxi. He then drugs them, takes them back to his crypt of mayhem, and performs heinous acts of violence on them before dumping their bloodied bodies off in various locations throughout the city.

When her sister goes missing, Linda (Emmanuelle Seigner) is directed to the attention of Inspector Enzo.  He lives in his underground office, surviving off of take in pizza boxes, and far off chances of hope. He has reason to believe that Linda's sister may be the yellow killer's latest victim. The two team up to track down the psychopath before it's too late.

I enjoyed this film, but a great deal of it was due mainly to the performance of Adrien Brody. I've become a huge fan of his, and make an effort to see everything he does. This is a small film for the Oscar winner, but you wouldn't know it based on his acting. He dives into his character, same as he would any huge Hollywood smash. I loved the look and attitude he gave Enzo, and the way he carried himself in this role. It was already interesting having a New Yorker working as a Detective in Europe; and Brody only granted Enzo more praise.

The film isn't perfect, but it is good. It's low budget but was handled with care and we've definitely seen a lot worse. There are some really intense moments and some great shots. I loved the wide shot of Enzo and Linda walking across a piazza and scaring off a cluster of pigeons.

My internet research has taught me that writer and director Dario Argento, has somewhat of a cult following and this may be how he was able to pocket Brody in the first place. Die-hard Argento fans seem to have mixed reviews on this particular piece. Having no room for comparison of his other work, I can only speak for Giallo, and say that it's worth a look.",1289433600,5,2707,4.591286307053942
4209129,1,B003VE9WU6,"Adrian Brody, the acclaimed Academy Award winner for Pianist in 2003 and who kissed everyone and everything in site even though they did not wish to be kissed, has now made a string of stinkers including Splice, Predators and now Giallo. Holding out for key roles that did not materialize nor resulted in an audience following after his award, Mr. Brody has now resorted to making pretty awful movies with threadbare scripts, poor direction and senseless waste of film/video stock. In Giallo, Adrian wears a wooden goatee to match his wooden tight Italian suit, to complement his wooden whiny voice and to neatly suit his, you guessed it, wooden acting. He plays a police detective in Italy (because he can't get work in the United States?) who's office is in the basement of the police station because he handles cases that no one else would. On his bulletin board, he has pinned gory crime scenes photos of mutilations, especially to women, without thought for confidentiality or atttempting to decipher of a pattern of crime. He smokes incesstently and follows clues that lead to nowhere. He tramples through crime scenes, barking out orders with no regard to proper handling of evidence or even simply just observing the scene. He has a tragic past and is now intent on delivering all serial killers to justice. However there is one problem, he actually does not have any ideas or tact and is actually clueless. The serial killer is laughable and has a voice that is more pathetic than Mr. Brody's. In one scene, he has a kidnapped victim strapped to a table with industrial farm implement all scattered about and also hanging on the wall. As he is hacking up the previous victim, the present victim yells, ""Hey, let me out of here you ugly bastard"". This would be the last thing that I would say in order to defray the killer from immediately turning his hostile attention towards me. The direction is by Dario Argento who has seen better days and should really let his daughter, Asia carry out the family's legacy. At least, she still has both beauty and brains. The film takes a quick turn for the worse in the closing scene (I will not spoil the ending as you will have to discover the idiocy of of the script and acting). The final ending after this was so abrupt so subtle and inconsequential that I thought that I had missed the point (no spoiler here, again). I had to replay it again at least three times and I still did not comprehend what happened as Mr. Argento's last stamped image on the screen was not everlasting in the viewer's eyes. The moral of the story is that while Mr. Brody is on a rampage to get work, any work even a string of horror movies, his audience will be perpetually subjected to incomprehensible and inadequate and listless productions that will instill terror, not by story content but by lack of a cohesive story. The last laugh will always be at the audience's expense if we continue to attend Mr. Brody's future projects. Stop now, Adrian.",1288483200,,2982,4.671102661596958
4209130,2,B003VE9WU6,"The first time I saw a Dario Argento film I was blown away by his artistic depiction of dreamlike violence. The colors, the strange music, the fluid camera work connected with me on an almost spiritual level. I needed to see more. Thus began a quest to purchase every title directed by the Italian master of the macabre. I wasn't disappointed until I bought ""Phantom of the Opera"" with Julian Sands. I thought, maybe this was just a fluke. A bad movie with no redeemable value. I stuck with him through mediocre fare like ""Do you like Hitchcock?"", ""Sleepless"" (which was actually pretty good), and ""The Card Player"", not to mention the terrible ""Jenifer"" for Showtime's Masters of Horror. Then, came ""Pelts"", which made me realize the master still had it in him.
  I was nearly ecstatic when he declared he was going to make ""Mother of Tears"", his finale in the tale of the Three Mothers. When I finally bought and watched it, I was blown away by the unspeakable mess of a movie he just created. An utter bomb, completely unwatchable. But still, I didn't give up on the master.
  Now, with ""Giallo"", a movie that seems to have Argento's trademark right in the title, I felt this might just be a comeback for him. After watching it, I have to say that I've finally given up on the Italian Hitchcock. Although not as bad as ""Mother of Tears"", it's not much better. Argento has given up on creating artistic, dreamlike violence on celluloid and has just been offering us excessive bloody violence. No art, no style, just non-stop screaming, cussing, blood-spilling trash.
  I can see why Adrien Brody didn't want this movie to see the light of day in America. It's not because he didn't get paid (I believe he did). It's because he didn't want to be associated with this mess of a movie.
  Poor Dario, please just stick to producing movies from now on. God forbid your ""Dracula 3D"" ever gets finished. I can just imagine what that would be like: Look at that bat on a string coming out of the screen. A scene only Ed Wood could appreciate.
  The future of Italian artistic horror now solely lies in the hands of Michele Soavi. But, how long do I have to wait for ""Catacombs Club""?",1287792000,2,2177,4.544757033248082
4209131,4,B003VE9WU6,"you can't always listen to the haters.

going in to this movie, i wasn't expecting very much.  at best, i figured the title of the film was a cheap cash-in on the director's legendary output.  something to get ""nerds"" like myself to pony up the funds to watch some new argento.  i hadn't really dug anything recent from argento, and it certainly seemed like the glory days were long gone.

maybe going in with little expectation helped, but this film is a huge improvement over the weak tv-movie vibe of ""mother of tears"" and certainly a major improvement in the acting department.  having adrian brody on board absolutely bumped this film up 10x.  granted, he doesn't have TONS of stuff to do in the film, and he plays it straight as the detective with a troubled past who has his ""own methods"" for catching the psycho killer.  typically his character would've been staffed by a no-name or has-been actor who really phones it in.  having someone of his caliber on board makes his character stick out, and this film infinitely more watchable.  argento keeps brody in the spotlight damn near the entire film, and i daresay his character is more important in the end than the actual killer is.

the cinematography alone is a thousand times better than the bland, ho-hum look of latter day argento output.  this has warmth and class when zooming around the city and a suitably dank look in the killer's ""dungeon""  attention to detail in these areas makes a difference.  you've also got a more fleshed out story that makes more sense.  everyone who follows argento knows it's usually been style over substance.  his dream-like images and narratives being the important than the acting and the logic of the story.  in my opinion, this film turns that around.  we've got a simple story that makes sense with actors who act believably!  (as opposed to mother of tears...yikes!)

i think alot of argento ""fanboys"" have a hard time criticizing because love of his earlier films carries them through some not-so-great current work.  choking down some banal by-the-numbers thriller just because the director USED to make amazing movies is not something i'm interested in.  dario can't make 1001 movies that look and act just like the films his legion of ""nerd-fans"" (myself included) love.  he needs to make movies that regular folk would want to go see.  i think this is one of the first films that would work for a wider audience beyond the film student, gore-fan, or argento completist.

admittedly, i'm a huge argento fan, and i was going to see this no matter what.  there's little sense in denying the maestro's work really has suffered over the last few films.  giallo is a MUCH better film than people are giving it credit for online and in reviews.  it's NOT suspiria, it's not deep red or cat o nine tails....(it's also NOT the 1970's either)  those films had their time and their place.  in order to stay relevant, more modern approaches are needed.  you can't expect to see a bunch of crazy lighting and wacky camera angles like it's 1970.

granted, it's not all roses here.  the character of ""linda"" played by emmanuelle seigner isn't always believable, and the fact that for most of the movie she's tramping around with ""inspector enzo"" and viewing police scenes and documents like she's his partner is a little far-fetched.  a few times she was asked to leave, or stepped out...but she basically just latches onto inspector enzo and just stays there.  i know she was supposed to be grief-stricken and desperate to find her sister, but cmon.

i also had a little trouble with ""giallo"" himself.  he speaks english with a broken italian accent but the voice is a little humorous the first time you hear it.  you DONT want people to chuckle when they hear the killer for the first time!  it reminded me of fulci's new york ripper where the killer quacks like a duck.  later on though, you get used to it and the broken english ""caveman"" lines he throws out kinda worked!  ""i die...she die""  anyhow, a little more creepiness in his voice or even effects to make it deeper or more disturbing would've helped there.

the classic argento gore was in place for this film....a hammer smashing to the face is shown, for example....but there were cutaways from the violence occasionally when i would've like to see a grittier show-it-all vibe.  although that movie sucked, mother of tears went pretty crazy with the gore.  argento had some trend-setting violence is his early films, so it's not like he's a stranger to it, and restraint in the gore keeps it classier, as we don't need argento to hop aboard the annoying ""hostel, saw..blahblahblah trend"" but they cutaway from a lip being cut with a scissors, and show a face pummelling with a hammer?!?!

all said, this is a current, well-shot thriller...and there's nothing wrong with that!

GIALLO is great horror and great entertainment!",1286755200,7,317,4.213114754098361
4209134,2,B003VE9WU6,"Even the worst Dario Argento films have managed to at least get DVD releases in the past decade or so, so the fact that Giallo was filmed two years ago and is still unreleased in most of the world aside from a handful of badly received festival screenings where it was laughed off the screen doesn't exactly fill you with confidence. It may not be the director's favorite film by a long shot - despite the misleading 'written and directed by' credit, he was simply a director for hire with the script written by the separately credited Jim Agnew and Sean Keller with the producers apparently no longer returning his phone calls - but it's fair to say that it's a long way from being his worst, thankfully never descending to the depths of Phantom of the Opera or the lacklustre The Card Player. Unfortunately it's also not especially good.

The story is serviceable enough, with model Elsa Pataky abducted by a deformed serial killer who likes to take his time destroying beautiful things and her frantic sister (a haggard Emmanuelle Seigner) teaming up with Adrian Brody's broody Italian-American cop to find her while there's still enough of her to find. Despite the set-up, it avoids going the Eli Roth torture porn route, but there are few of Argento's signature flourishes. Not only are the gloves literally off but the film's one 'big' death scene is nothing to write home about: just a simple fall from a tall building. Worse, a couple of minor twists aside, the plot just plods along with not much happening until the last half hour before a last scene that feels like it was tacked on not so much to give the film a happy ending but because what you suspect was the original ending didn't pack enough of a punch.

While it's generally better executed, there are fewer ideas to play with than his less than impressive Mother of Tears, and what there are are fairly familiar cop movie clichs. True, Adrien Brody's lone cop does have a rather neat backstory explaining why he has a talent for tracking down predatory killers, but the early hints of having a damaging Will Graham-like empathy with his killer come to nothing despite Brody playing both hunters because they're such wildly different performances linked only by silly voices (a grizzled Jack Nicholson-Mickey Rourke hybrid for the cop and an Italian Quasimodo for the killer). It's probably the killer's voice that provided the lion's share of the laughs to those derisive festival audiences, but Brody Methodically overdoes the tortured doleful looks as the cop, at times looking like the Eighth Dwarf, Goatee, after Snow White bit the apple.

On the plus side, thanks to Frederic Fasano's cinematography it's the best-looking Argento film in years. It's not a return to the extreme and vivid colors of the Suspiria years but it's a welcome move away from the pallid and lifeless look of many of his latter movies to something with a bit more warmth to its color scheme and a good eye for the Turin locations. But overall, despite all the Argento touchstones the writers incorporated in the screenplay, it's a rather soft by-the-numbers effort that could have been made by almost any capable director whose heart wasn't quite in it but still tried to make the best of what he had to work with. You won't have trouble making it through to the end, but you won't have trouble sleeping after seeing it either.",1284940800,17,3376,4.757679180887372

Dario, it may be time to wrap it up and try your hand at some other creative pursuits. The film genre has passed you by...Please take Adrian Brody with you..",1284422400,2,489,4.384615384615385

However, I have seen just about every film Adrien Brody has been in, and I enjoy watching him bring these characters to life. This is a very dark thriller which probably is not a general audience type of movie. It is disturbing in many ways, but I also found it to be realistic. We live in a world a serial killers and people who enjoy sadistic behavior towards others. This movie shows that but also shows you a possible explanation of where/how it starts for the killer as well as the detective (Adrien Brody). The ending is not at all what I expected. This wasn't the best thriller I ever saw, and by no means the worse. It did keep my interest and at times had me sitting on the edge of my seat which is what thrillers and mysteries are suppose to do. that being said, I will probably check out other films by Dario Argento now that I've gotten a taste.",1380326400,,956,4.229508196721311

8406702,3,B003VE9WU6,"While it doesn't impress with stylish kills or exotic elements, Giallo (2010) contains some decent gore, and reflects a slight return to form for Dario Argento (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Red/dp/B004KDYR1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Red</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Susperia/dp/B000S0GYRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Susperia</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Opera/dp/B000S0GYRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Opera</a>), an icon in the horror genre, who's reputation has taken some hits of late.  Centered on the investigation into to the disappearance of a number of young women, the movie offers little that is new, but is a competently shot thriller, with a few exciting moments.  Mild spoilers follow.

Set in Turin, Italy, the film features Adrien Broady (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predators/dp/B0040YFR1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predators</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-of-Sam/dp/B00002RAO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer of Sam</a>), in a dual role, as police inspector Enzo Avolfi, and also as Flavio Volpe, a ""pattern killer"" suffering from jaundice, nicknamed Giallo (Italian for yellow).  When Celine (Elsa Pataky,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-Re-Annimator/dp/B0000DC12T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond Re-Annimator</a>), a fashion model, is abducted by a psycho driving a cab, her sister Linda (Emmanuelle Seigner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ninth-Gate/dp/B0027VTMAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ninth Gate</a>) visits police headquarters, and is soon along for the ride, as Avolfi investigates the case.

After a decent setup, the story begins to meandering.  The more that is revealed about the killer Volpe, the less suspense there is.  Although violent, Volpe is a rather ridiculous figure, who is very fortunate that his victims are too inept to escape.  The killer terrorizes and brutally tortures his victims, in a pretty inventive location, the bowels of an abandoned gas tank.  The Inspector has a violent and bloody past, but how it fits in, isn't really clear, and there seems to be no compelling reason why Broady should appear as both cop and killer.

As time goes on, it becomes difficult to like either of the sisters.  Linda's concern for her sister is understandable, but she just doesn't belong in a police investigation, and her pushy attitude becomes annoying.  Celine's behavior is also quite strange, as she taunts the killer, and then causes him to go after Linda.  The conclusion is weak and unsatisfying, but Argento manages to conclude matters without crash landing.

Adrien Broady, who is also credited as an executive producer, took legal action to stop the release of the film on DVD, because he reportedly had not been paid.  Once on the cutting edge of the horror genre, some of Argento's critics feel he may have lost the ability to tell a story effectively.  Giallo is far from Argento's best, and may do little to change the minds of his harshest critics, but a few may resist shoveling too much dirt, on a career they believe is over.",1375574400,,3325,6.769953051643192
