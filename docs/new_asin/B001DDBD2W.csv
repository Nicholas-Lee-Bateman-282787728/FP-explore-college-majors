8292801,5,B001DDBD2W,"In our melting economy, Fox has gone with the sure thing, 4 of their biggest and sometimes best biblical epics from the 50's and 60's. The strongest of the collection are of course the oldest: The Robe and it's sequel, Demetrius and the Gladiators Starring Jean Simmons and Susan Hayward respectively. The sets and acting are sumptuous. As for ""The Bible"", This was one of the better attempts to revive the biblical epic in the 60's dealing with the creating of man to Abraham. It is very well done in all aspects. Director John Huston's performance as Noah, is delightfully light and refreshing. This is the highlight of this movie. ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" fails on several counts. The Judean province is actually Monument Valley in Southern Utah and the sets are big too surrealistic. Max Von Sydow is overshadowed by a cast of well known actors that pop their head up in this movie from out of nowhere. And it gets annoying at times. It could have been a better film.

""The Robe"" and utilizing many of the same sets, ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" have become classics due to their durability. At times the acting is over the top (Jay Robinson) and wooden (the ever-stoic Victor Mature) and the ladies fare the best. Jean Simmons is wasted as a mere love interest to Richard Burton. Her talent is not worthy of such a limited role. But the grand Simmons makes the most of it. Ms. Hayward plays a watered down Messalina with great relish. She is a delight visually and in every other department, to watch. She is a Hollywood Icon.

Sure all these DVDs have already been released and are available. But if you don't own them, why pay more and get the box set?

It's worth it.",1223942400,12,1683,4.584717607973422
8292802,2,B001DDBD2W,"Regardless of the good or bad points of the four films in this set, any fan of old movies probably already has these titles in their collection.  If 20th Century-Fox wanted to release some religious/historical epics this year, why not choose ESTHER AND THE KING with Joan Collins, THE EGYPTIAN with Victor Mature, or THE LAST DAYS OF SODOM & GOMORRAH with Stewart Granger?  I suppose from the studio's point of view it makes sense to keep going with a sure thing, but I find it annoying that they keep repackaging movies that have already been out on DVD.",1219276800,11,555,4.595959595959596
