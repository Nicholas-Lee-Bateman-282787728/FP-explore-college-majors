8132978,1,B000GIXGYS,"The movie was a bit slow, and is based on the book by the same name. My main complaint was that only half of the movie played on the DVD. It stops midway through the story. Was hoping to use it during the Easter season starting Easter Sunday, but that plan can't happen now. Very inconvenient.",1364860800,,293,4.25

It is simply coloring book pages set to audio of a woman who is reading a text much too quickly, and on a much higher level than any small child could comprehend.",1301443200,3,267,4.32
