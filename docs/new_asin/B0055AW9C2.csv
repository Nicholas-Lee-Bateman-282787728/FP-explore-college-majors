8457743,5,B0055AW9C2,"This collection of five short films by Warren Pereira are very well done. Each story has a different style of comedy and has extreme detail to combine sound, picture, dialogue, and music to create a high quality film.
""Who's Good Looking"" has a Woody Allen type of humor. This story was done in one continuous take. Every line and every movement was timed out perfect to create such a fun, light hearted laugh for the audience.
""Salt and Silicone"" has three different perspectives from the lead character's point of view. Each point of view is set in the same location, but has a totally different feel. Not just by the dialogue changing but by the specific detail in coloring and audio of the film.
""Lovely Coffee"" had a wonderful film quality to it. Each frame looked perfectly balanced. The audio on this film was beautiful and helped the story flow flawlessly.
""Lacking Lewis"" points out our fears and insecurities. It shows them in an artistic and dramatic light.
""Superhero Talent "" was a darker film showing the comedy between two co-workers discussion and argument over women and their status.
Overall I truly enjoyed these five films. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys satire, humor and loves a film that has artistic talent in audio and cinematography.",1438560000,,1272,4.839449541284404
8457744,5,B0055AW9C2,The Warren Pereira Collection stands unique in style and quality. A definite must have for some of the finest comedic moments you'll see anywhere in Hollywood. The potential of Pereira's fierce talent sees no limits and will be recognized for years to come.,1374624000,,257,5.0
8457745,5,B0055AW9C2,"""The Short Films of Warren Pereira"" is a sexy, smart and entertaining collection. Who should watch it? Anyone who wants to be inspired to think and enjoys great cinematography, without having to sit through a 2 hour film to feel satisfied. The stories are sharp and witty, with just the right balance of edge, sex, satire and visual appeal to keep you thoroughly engaged throughout. Most interesting is that Warren, writer and director also acts in the films. This allows for flawless execution of each story, and intrigues you to question his own personal views on topics the films tackle such as our obsession with image and the absurdity of what we value in today's society.",1342137600,,677,4.844827586206897
8457746,5,B0055AW9C2,"Warren Pereira manages to pull off not one, not two, but five world class short films. It's exciting to watch this up and coming filmmaker develop his craft and play with different elements in each successive film. Each film displays in own stylistic qualities from the static two shots in ""Lacking Lewis"" to the jaw dropping moving masters in ""Superhero Talent"" and ""Lovely Coffee."" Pereira has clearly drawn influences from some of the greatest names in cinema history: Woody Allen, Francois Truffaut, Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman to name a few. While obviously taking some influence from some of these great names, Pereira has managed to create an atmosphere unique to himself through stylized dialog, complex camera movies and unique frame composition. Pereira also shows that he possess multiple talents as he stars in four out of the five films as well as filled the role of writer and produce on all five films. In this day and age where anyone with a cheap camera and editing software can make a movie there is a lot of junk that finds it's way to the screen. It's nice to see some quality short filmmaking for once. I would expect great things from this filmmaker in the future!",1337126400,,1191,4.814634146341463
8457747,4,B0055AW9C2,"Warren Pereira's compilation of short films showcases his amazing work in art direction, editing, and cinematography. I absolutely love the perspective of each piece and was impressed with the soundtracks which seemed tailor made for each short. Thematically, the pieces artfully explore and question not only societal mores, but also personal, internal struggles. Modern, edgy, sexy, and fun, Pereira's collection is worth looking into.",1322006400,,437,5.84375
8457748,5,B0055AW9C2,"It's hard to find good short films... either because they try too hard to crunch everything down, or because they expand one thing too far, but this collection works. The acting and characters are just quirky enough to be that friend that you like but never see, and the cinematography is beautiful. For an independent film company, no expense was spared for the right equipment to make the shots and audio stand on their own.",1321315200,,426,4.693333333333333
8457749,5,B0055AW9C2,"By far my favourite is Salt and Silicone. Well acted by all parties, but my favourite is the scene with the sword. Vex acts so naturally he just seems like someone I'd like to hang out with (although I think I'd spend alot of the time rolling my eyes at how ridiculous his life is...)
Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something light, which still leaves alot for discussion later.",1317600000,2,401,4.583333333333333
8457750,5,B0055AW9C2,"High quality, professionally done short films. Lacking Lewis, Who's Good Looking? and Salt and Silicone are my favorite. Particularly like photography, color and sound. Solid acting, funny and clever dialog. Highly recommend these entertaining films.",1316304000,2,250,6.171428571428572
8457751,5,B0055AW9C2,I loved these films! All five of them are totally different and I looked forward to seeing the next one. I loved the director's humor (he also acts in all of them!) in the writing and in the performances. They are all beautifully shot and I can tell that the director really cares about filmmaking. I've done some research on him and it looks like he's writing his first feature film. I am looking forward to seeing what he comes up with next. Highly recommend these films to anyone looking for good entertainment and who enjoys the art and craft of filmmaking.,1311379200,2,561,4.509803921568627
8457752,5,B0055AW9C2,"This set of short films was quite a find for me. I heard about Mr. Pereira's debut at the Cannes Film festival this year from a friend of mine whom I respect for their taste in quality independent films. The film shown at Cannes was Pereira's short film Salt and Silicone. A film that focuses on the lead characters internal debate about weather or not his girlfriend should get breast implants. I was curious to see Salt and Silicone as well as his other works.
The first thing that you will notice is the high quality of every detail in all of Mr. Pereira's films. Photography, sound, story and acting are all very solid. The audio and film quality is especially impressive in Lovely Coffee and Salt and Silicone.
This set of films serves as a progression for Mr. Pereira and it shows. The DVD starts with Lacking Lewis a high brow comedy about a hairless man and his insecurities surrounding this hairless conundrum when he is around his girlfriend. I found myself completely engaged in this story and found it incredibly well done for an initial attempt at film making but this is only the first in the progression and by the time you view Salt and Silicone you will admire how far Mr. Pereira has come with his work. Salt and Silicone is truly a cinematic Marvel not in the big budget CGI sense but in the level of detail the Mr. Periera put into this film. For example subtle changes in color and lighting that enhance each of the three acts.
I highly recommend this collection to anyone interested in a set of very entertaining films. I hope that I will see more from this young and exciting film maker and can't wait to see what he does next.",1311292800,2,1650,4.466887417218543
