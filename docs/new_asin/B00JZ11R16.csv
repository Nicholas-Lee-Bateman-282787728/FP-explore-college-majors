8654661,5,B00JZ11R16,"Just when I think I've heard all there is to know about prophetic and worship dance, I watch another of Pastor Lynn's DVD and I learned so much more! My view and scope of dancing before the Lord broadens with each new tool I experience. The Creative Worship DVD goes hand in hand with the book of the same name. The two together provide everything needed to further increase creativity, unity, and variety to worship dances and choreography. Pastor Lynn describes, then demonstrates exercises designed to encourage spontaneity and creativity in a team. She also shows how to choreograph a dance in 30 seconds! I highly recommend the DVD and the book as together they provide a complete and detailed education and visual representation of exercises and activations that will aid a dance team in producing beautiful dances before the Lord.",1409184000,2,837,4.943262411347518
