8686926,1,B00P8QRQFS,"I purchased this from Costco and returned it the next day, after sampling the introductory DVD and a couple of the lessons DVDs. BTW, the introductory DVD is a 2-hour boring monologue of this guy in front of an audience taking notes. I don't know hoe they intend to learn to play an instrument by attending a lecture. The lesson DVDs are a little better, but still not helpful to learn piano. Also, the description on the box promised some printable material, which is deceiving as each DVD just contains a couple PDFs with the sheet music and the chords for each of the 10 songs, but not additional instructional material whatsoever. I've tried many instrument learning methods in the past and this is the worst I've seen.",1420588800,4,723,4.65625
