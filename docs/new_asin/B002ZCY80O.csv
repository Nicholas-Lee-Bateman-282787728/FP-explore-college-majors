4014416,5,B002ZCY80O,"This series never disappoints and keeps you guessing.  Sometimes the legal theories are non-sensical (to a lawyer), but the suspense makes that easy to overlook. If you like sharp turns in your mysteries, this one is for you.",1273708800,4,225,4.921052631578948
4014417,4,B002ZCY80O,"If the Bernie Madoff story fascinates you, then you will enjoy this season.  If you are sick of that story, you won't like it.  That is Patty Hughes' case this season although given another name. Lily Tomlin plays ""Mrs. Bernie Madoff"" and Campbell Scott plays the son.  They are both terrific. Since this is ""fiction"", the show can posit answers which don't exist in the real world, such as where the money is that they've probably stashed away for themselves. Ted Danson makes a reappearance in his king villain role. He is sensational. His religious conversion in and of itself is a great story line, only equalled by his getting a top movie star to do the story of his life. Actually, if everyone else disappeared and we followed only the Ted Danson show from here on, this show would be 5 stars.

Then there are the things I don't like.  I still don't like the way the script jumps back and forth in time. This can be done by a director with terrific skills (think Scorsese) but in the hands of most others, it just ends up confusing, not to mention unduly repetitive. There are also still too many characters and actors in this series, which has been its problem from day one.  When you have Glenn Close, Ted Danson, Lily Tomlin and Campbell Scott in your cast, WHY would you want to draw attention AWAY from them and onto lesser actors? Finally, the Rose Byrne character I still find mostly annoying.  Either get a stronger actress to play her role or eliminate her character. Three seasons in, I am also very annoyed with all the allusions cast in all three seasons that Patty may be her real mother. I don't know if it is a red herring or not and don't much care.  I just would like it out of the script as it interferes with the more interesting case going on in the season.

4014419,5,B002ZCY80O,"The third season of 'Damages' is a bit of a departure from the pervious two seasons. Where season one was an extremely tight, maniacal thriller, and season two was a knotty, complex, esponiage-esque mystery, season three takes a cue from classic noir sensibilities. Season three is extremely understated and character driven. They are more concerned with digging into the character's psyches than with the actual court case. A standout aspect to the season is Patty's intriguing dream sequences. As for the case, it's almost non-existant, which is the point. The fact that the true center of the case remains a mystery up until the last episode helps enforce the centerless, surreal world of noir. Like any good noir, you never feel safe when watching season three.

My advice is that you need to be patient with this season. It's not as instantly rewarding as the other two, but the ending does pack a punch. I don't want to spell out all the noir connections in this little review because part of the fun is trying to figure them all out. Do some research on what makes something 'noir' and see if you agree with me. What you can expect more of in season three: is stellar acting from the impeccable cast, great dialogue and narrative construction and a very timely court case.

'Damages' is a phenomenal show and I think season three will be very rewarding to long time fans and especially to patient, attentive viewers.

'Damages' season three comes highly recommended.",1272758400,84,1473,4.837301587301587
4014420,3,B002ZCY80O,"I watched all the shows as they were broadcast. I have been watching since the beginning. This season, despite having fabulous material and actors o work with, was the weakest yet. (That said, it was still pretty good, compared to most of the dreck on TV.)This seems like a transitional season, leading up to next season's conclusion to the stories. I hope they do better next season, they're certainly capable of it! And kudos to Ted Danson for the fabulous job he's doing!",1272499200,8,474,4.72289156626506
4014421,4,B002ZCY80O,"This Bernie Madoff like season of the show is better than season two.  I still am not crazy about the way we hop back and forth in time constantly in the show but I am getting used to it. This episode shows the two women main characters more deeply enmeshed than ever. The younger is closing in on the secret of her background while the older is battered on every front. They are trying to bring the ""Madoff"" clan down. Campbell Scott continues to develop a smarmy son to the Bernie character while Lily Tomlin comes close to stealing the show as his mother and ""Bernie's"" widow. Perhaps the best character of all though is played by Ted Danson, who is initially hilarious in his religious conversion until the darker side of what he's up to comes out in this episode. Danson has been consistently excellent in every season of this show and should somehow remain permanantly a part of it.",1270598400,2,888,4.515527950310559

4014452,5,B002ZCY80O,"Resumed watching this fine FX series on DVD  after a 5 year hiatus.  Season 3 is completely riveting.  Glenn Close stars as Patty Hewes, a New York attorney who is ruthless and ethically challenged.  She could teach Machiavelli a thing or two.  Close brings the intensity and edge dialed back just a notch from the psycho she played in Fatal Attraction.  Rose Byrne returns as would-be protg Ellen Parsons who has quit Hewes & Associates and is now working for the DAs office.  Tate Donovan also is on hand as Pattys right hand man Tom Shayes.
  The primary plot this season revolves around a Bernie Madoff sort of fraudster named Louis Tobin whose pyramid scheme investment empire has toppled and hes about to serve a life prison sentence.  Pattys office court appointed trustee tasked to follow the money and try and recover as much as possible for Tobins victims.  Naturally theres any number of twists and turns to this tale and they are well told by the Damages writing team.  Each season is like deconstructing an intricate Origami sculpture, unfolding each crease reveals a little of how it was made but still hides much.  The device of flash forward and flash backs allows small clues to be revealed to the audience but as they're often lacking context beware jumping to conclusions regarding their meaning.  Its great fun to watch.  We start out with the shocker that Tom is dead and Patty is t-boned in a hit in and run accident by a car owned by Tom.  Tobins eldest son Joe, played by Campbell Scott initially is disgusted by his fathers malfeasance and just wants to make things right but once he gets wind of a huge hidden stash of money his father sequestered for the family he undergoes a tragic change of personality.
In keeping with the shows trend for taking comedic actors and putting them in serious roles this season features two fine performances by Lily Tomlin and Martin Short.
The real surprise for me was Martin Short.  Long before Jim Carrey made a career out of over the top, creepy and not so funny characters (Fire Marshall Bill anyone?) Martin Short was doing the same shtick a decade or more before.  I never personally cared for his mugging and disturbing personas and did not find him amusing.  Here hes playing it straight as Tobin family attorney Leonard Winstone conveying a certain degree of menace thats surprising and utterly convincing.  Who knew Short could play a dramatic role so well?  Lily Tomlins come a long way from the late 60s and Rowan & Martins Laugh-In series.  She also quite good in the part as the Tobin family matriarch.  Is it just me or are she and Shirley Maclane starting to morph into the same person?  Ted Danson also returns this season as well reprising his Arthur Frobisher character from Season 2.  Although tying up some loose ends from his story arc seemed a little excessive for all thats going on but it was entertaining seeing Ted in action and we get a brief appearance from Timothy Olyphant as well.
When the season reaches its exciting denouement much is revealed, we learn more of Pattys back story in the bargain.  This is a twisted show and Im looking forward to what happens in Season 4.",1430870400,,3167,4.661261261261261

In conjunction with knowledge of the laws and administrations that make them touch the lives of real people, a insight into professional and people politics lifts the characters right out of fiction to a realism that makes one wonder if the writers are not revealing real world incidents under the banner of entertainment.

When ever other shows or movies bore me with juvenile schemes, I am delighted to know that I can always count on Patti Hewes and cast to bring some realism to the screen.  Thank you for adopting this series. People like myself need believable plots on the screen.",1409270400,,739,4.72093023255814

4014593,5,B002ZCY80O,A five for sure!! I can't stop watching.the writers and actors are amazing. I wish it was still on the air,1403049600,,106,4.095238095238095
4014604,5,B002ZCY80O,"but I  got hooked.  The characters in this series are a bit stock, but the plot keeps it going with plenty of twists and turns and cliff hangars. The development of the character of the young lawyer (Byrne) isn't very convincing.  The older lawyer (Close) is supposed to have some nuance.  Although Glenn Close is a great actress the script doesn't.really bring it out. . This is a plot driven series (with good acting by Close) and it  works very well as such.  It may use the conceit of grappling with values of personal life vs. career, but that is just an excuse. It is really all about the cliff hangers.  What more can you ask from a TV series?",1402617600,,650,4.366666666666666
4014605,5,B002ZCY80O,"Like I said of the previous season, the use of the accumulating flash forward is genius.  The changing major character relationships and positions keep it interesting also.",1402272000,,172,5.37037037037037

4014626,5,B002ZCY80O,"I am binge watching so the series are somewhat running together in my mind. They've all have had a grabber that keeps me coming back to find out what happens. This one was intense for me. The series has had some excellent acting. I was really impressed by Martin Short. He was superb! Story lines are like a good one hour drama stretched out, proportionally over the weeks.",1399852800,,373,4.5
4014627,2,B002ZCY80O,"The first season I was hooked.  Binge watched it on Netflix one weekend, couldn't turn it off. Second Season took me longer to get through. Third Season is a total snorefest. It's just the same plot and story lines over and over again.  Nothing really happens in the episodes anymore, it's like a soap opera where we might as well just skip to the last episode and save ourselves hours.",1399852800,,386,4.5
4014628,5,B002ZCY80O,season three of damages holds true to keeping the suspense building.  the story lines are great and keeps you guessing from the very beginning...this is a great show!!,1399680000,,167,4.964285714285714

4014644,5,B002ZCY80O,"Such a complex psychological intrigue. The writing and acting are superb. I have withdrawal if I don't watch and episode every evening. If you are studying Narrcisisstic Personality disorder with violent tendencies, or ASocial Personality Disorder...this is the complete education. Highly recommend it!",1398124800,,302,6.046511627906977
4014645,5,B002ZCY80O,Talk about a sit on the edge of your seat series!  I bought all three seasons for my husband --- who has everything!  Such a good story line!  Somewhat R-rated --- but well worth watching!,1397952000,,188,4.314285714285714
4014646,4,B002ZCY80O,"Still love this series.  Glenn Close is the best, but so many things weren't answered in this season and more questions have come up.  I'm hoping that Season 4 will pull the story line together a little more.  Keeps me watching though.",1397865600,,235,4.5476190476190474
4014647,5,B002ZCY80O,I finished the third season and was having a hard time living my real life.  I became totally absorbed.  I am sure I will watch 4th season also. The moment Patty tells her husband Phil how she feels about their reconciliation was unbelieveable. The acting in this series is superb. Martin Short and Lily Tomilin are first rate.  David Carradine is so mysterious.  This season stretches the plot. We enter the subconscious of Patty and Ellen.  Very interesting.,1397779200,,460,4.846153846153846
4014648,5,B002ZCY80O,"Maybe the best writing and acting in any drama on television. Totally unpredictable.

4014650,3,B002ZCY80O,"A story of two ambitious women who work together with good results for their clients. They, however,  dislike each other to the point of ordering the murder of one.  This series is mostly made up of  evil doers and one or two good guys.  The direction is somewhat  confusing because of its flipping back in forth in time. I appreciated the non-use of the F word.",1396396800,,362,4.424242424242424
4014651,5,B002ZCY80O,Love this series!  My cable company quit the channel over a year ago.  I was thrilled to find it on my Prime Free Streaming and am now trying to catch up.  If you like suspense this will keep you hooked!,1396396800,,203,4.025
4014652,5,B002ZCY80O,"Season 1,.2.3 were very amusing.  Season 4 is getting pretty dark.  The topics really strike home and build your interest.  Of course you have to appreciate law and the idea that corruption is being dramatized.  Although with the Savings and Loan and ponzi scheme realities, prove that the blatant abuse of people's trust is not unreal.  Cannot get over how many episodes we actually watched!  We still have not lost interest surprisingly.  Good writing, excellent acting, good scenes and production/directing.  We saw The Guardian and had similar expectations that Damages would get pretty dark before it was over.  Vikings, The Tudors, Reign are my favorites lately.",1396396800,,668,5.226415094339623

4014667,5,B002ZCY80O,"I really liked this program.  It was a bit dark at times.  However, I believe law and politics are not fair or cut and dry as what we like to think.  I believe this show outlines what happens often.",1395705600,,198,4.0256410256410255

4014685,4,B002ZCY80O,"I chose 4 stars for the entire five series of Damages because the storyline was intriguing.  The two professional women attorneys had been damaged emotionally from paths they had and sometimes had not chosen. They constantly skirted the edges of the law in order to win. Neither had the capacity to step away from the other's sometimes obscure challenge. In spite of their equal distrust for the other they often were drawn into the same battle of defense.

The reason I did not give the series five stars was because the story constantly went back and forth in time and in doing so was a bit repetitious.",1394755200,,605,4.644859813084112

4014687,5,B002ZCY80O,Watched the first 3 seasons and then FX sold it to Direct TV or something like that.  With Prime I ordered all 5 seasons and am enjoying a lot.  Got my boyfriend started watching and we watch several at one time.  Keeps you guessing.  Always does the unsuspected.  Glen Close is great in this.  Love it.,1394323200,,303,4.321428571428571

4014692,4,B002ZCY80O,Riviting but the time line jumps back and forth so it is sometimes hard to be sure which time line you are on.- They do try to help with special effects to the cinematography.  Always a new twist to take into account.  Very suspenseful.  Always seems to be a battle of wits between Pati Hughes and Ellen Parsons. Many cliff hangers between episodes.  Often have to watch 2 episodes back to back.,1393632000,,395,4.444444444444445

Again, the acting was very good and Ms. Close is a real professional for sure.  I am going to start season 4 so am hoping this will be as good as the past seasons.",1392508800,,408,3.8452380952380953

4014802,4,B002ZCY80O,"To do justice you must be soft and tough, but you cannot waffle or think you are always dealing with reasonable people, infact most of the crooks Close as to deal with are ruthless, selfish and down right murders; she reads their motives very well and takes them on just as ruthlessly, showing little merci even when they finally come down on their knees. The twists and turn in season 3 is emotionally draining and Glen Close and the crew do not disappoint, the interweaving of the personal and public lives of the characters and the resulting shock at how ambiguous the good is from the bad. Close is wicked, brilliant, soft, and thoroughly unpredictable, but in the end you know she will get the result that she wants even if it means betraying family and friends.",1389916800,,767,4.605839416058394

I just don't believe his character.
I think he is ""out acted"" by the rest of the cast.
Also, the writing is a little predictable and clich this season.

John Goodman's character is a fundamentalist Christian who preaches sermons to his kids, a war monger who uses the bible to justify his murderous exploits, curses a blue streak day and night yet he is revered in church and community.  I don't know....it just doesn't do anything for me. The previous 2 seasons were much better.",1384819200,,533,4.6

I tried reporting this to customer support, but they are very confused there and kept trying to tell me to try it in a different browser, or to reconfigure silverlight, etc.  After going back and forth several times, I finally realized they have one standard answer to all inquiries, and that customer support is in India, where they don't seem to have the slightest understanding of what this site is about.  Either the support representatives don't read the messages they receive, or they don't understand them.  As a result, the link has never gotten fixed, but as I was able to watch it in ""non-HD"" I was able to enjoy the season almost as well.

They are all so duplicitous and self-absorbed they have become the people I love to despise. Yet, taken as a whole, the show is masterful. The writing and the acting are top-notched.

4015217,3,B002ZCY80O,"I started watching""Damages"" on Amazon Prime. This was after I had watched ""Justified"" about 4 times all the way through, and had become a fan of Timothy Olyphant. Of course I am a Glenn Close fan, so I was delighted to learn that Olyphant was in the series in Season 2. I started watching Season 3 anxiously waiting to learn what had happened to Olyphant's character, ""Wes,"" and the investigation to his  opponent, Rick Messer's murder.. Imagine my disappointment that Olyphant didn't show up until the last episode of the season, and the entire drama of the closing of the 2nd season was barely mentioned. I understand why this happened, and it was a good thing for Olyphant that he had the opportunity to lead in ""Justified,"" about the time the 3rd season of ""Damages"" started, but the way it was handled didn't make much sense. The series had the potential to be great and 5 star all the way, but my main reason for the 3 stars is the way all episodes in all seasons switch around in time sequence. I don't know why the producers decided to do that. I could understand a flashback, starting in the present, going back, and then continuing in the present, but I truly don't see where this constant ""5 weeks earlier,"" ""Thanksgiving Day,"" etc improves upon the story line. Thankfully, I watched episodes back to back on Prime; I can't imagine trying to keep up with this week to week on television. Actually, I find that is the best way to watch a series anyway. I will continue watching ""Damages,"" and start the 4th season, though I will miss Olyphant. I can watch him this January in ""Justified."" Still, I think his character exit might have been handled differently. Having Ellen jumping into bed with the reporter, who looks vaguely like ""Wes,"" makes her seem  a little desperate. The best part of ""Damages,"" is the talented acting pool. The worst is the crazy in and out of the present time sequence.",1371945600,,1905,4.616519174041298
4015298,4,B002ZCY80O,"Although the plot is ""thick"", overall the fact that everyone seems to be a ""stinker"" is a bit depressing or else I would give the Season 3 a 5 star rating.  The acting is superb!",1371686400,,178,4.085714285714285

The last 2 episodes were crazy and that's why overall I liked how the season developed to get to those last monumental ""wow"" factor. The whole season was slow-building, very much devoted to the family dynamics that were definetely entertaining and crazy like Damages is bound to be. But again, it wasn't so much about the ""case"" as much as the other seasons are like, but more about character development and relationships. I was amazed at Martin Short's performance. Bravo to him.",1363305600,,640,4.672566371681416
4015426,3,B002ZCY80O,"The third season is when I finally decided to get this show off my watch list. The first season was a real cliffhanger, and I regretted only that I didn't have time for a marathon to watch all of it.
Second season was good, but strangely anemic considering all the intrigues, assaults, betrayals, and occasional conversations with the dead. When the third season started, I already was wondering just how much more meanness, treachery and flashbacks I could take.
I watched the first episode, and it seemed very formulaic, even if the story was different. The flashbacks grew ever more irritating. An event in season three will completely alter the structure of the firm, and what will follow is completely predictable.
The characters are well acted, maybe too much so, because I got to the point where I couldn't stand the sight of Ellen anymore, and wished Frobisher would somehow come back. When one is wishing for Frobisher as a shining light, well, there's a problem. It doesn't seem that there will be anything new in this series. Also, I've worked in the legal field, so I know that this crowd would have been disbarred halfway through Season One.",1363219200,2,1154,4.8040201005025125

Third season is really not worth watching - very poor actor play, each serie is filled with long-lasting face shots, eyes darting and things like that, which are supposed to mean something, but eventually lead to nothing. Screenplay is also not good, the series are cut in the most strange way - first you get ""now"", then next moment it is ""six months before"" and then afterwards it is ""five months after"". That is the only thing which could hold suspense.
Also all these long and fake face shots are repeated constantly, actors really need to do something with their play. Glenn Close is decent, though, but you could not make interesting series on one actress, when whole cast plays outrageously bad. Definitely not worth watching, when there is Breaking Bad around.",1347840000,,912,4.7784810126582276

No waiting to get into it. Glen Close was the wonderful character you love to hate.
I was rivited and spent many nights up until 2AM just to see one more episode.
Every character was excellently portrayed and there was nothing predictable about
it. I couldn't wait to be able to sit and watch episode after episode until I had
to drag myself away. From season 1 which was fabulous, through season 3 it kept my
interest peeked. I wasn't crazy about the ending in season 3 but I realize there is
season 4 to look forward to. This was a series that was hard to even put on pause.
If you like suspense and intrique, this is the show for you!! Can't wait for season
4. Kudos to the whole staff that put this together, and to each celebrity that had
a part in it..Bravo!!

Even Damages is starting to lose its ability to capture the audience with its riveting characters and storylines. But not before Season 3 thankfully. This season is probably that last truly good one. It does not disappoint. Season 4 showed some decline but it was still better than most of the stuff on today. Other shows I have enjoyed but which have showed decline of late are Mad Men, Sons of Anarchy, The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad.

It takes brain power to watch because the timeline jumps forward and backward repeatedly, a bit like the movie, Memento, and because the writing is nuanced. In Season three, the sound editing was a bit over the top, with that ominous crashing sound (think cheesy trailers for action films) to accompany each gruesome and gritty cut. They already had my attention, without going over the top with sound effects. However, if you love whodunnits crossed with Breaking Bad, LA Law, Hitchcock, Perry Mason, and the Iron Lady, and you enjoy scratching your head instead of being spoon fed a plot so you can multi-task while 'watching' TV out of the corner of your eye, put this series on your must-see list.",1337126400,,876,4.885906040268456

The 3rd season focuses on a lawsuit based on a ponzi scheme where thousands of people lost their investments. The story line is fast-paced and exciting, and like the first two seasons, shows you snippets of the ""ending"" while leading you there slowly, episode by episode.

The 3rd season is my second favorite. The 1st season was excellent, the 2nd season good, but the 3rd season cranks it back up to the level of the 1st. The only negative thing is you really need to watch the previous two seasons - this isn't the type of show you can jump into the middle of and understand what's going on.

DAMAGE'S Season's One and Two were so sharp, so starkly realistic in depicting the depths and heights of each principal character; plotting, motivations, sudden twists which were spectacular but remarkably believable and came easily from carefully-drawn, personalities and situations.

Not so in Season Three. Here, characterizations are a great deal thinner, their natures not as developed or believable. It's not the as-always great acting of Close & Co, but the writing. Characters seem cartoon-ish, abbreviated, stereotyped.

There seems to be more superfluous characters. Add to that, central characters were given hasty-seeming melodramatic exit scenarios to wrap up their parts. Those extraneous characters were given quick hello's and then contrived reasons for sudden goodbye's.

There won't be any spoilers in this review, because there are just so many of them; shocking denouements which suddenly usher characters out; most seeming rushed and melodramatic; maybe called for by stereotyped characters there only to justify some plot twist.

Overall it seems this season was designed to end the series. I hope it won't be; I pray that if Damages is to go they go out in a blaze of intelligence and far-more sophisticated plotting, acting, dialogue and sophisticated entertainment. Amen",1319414400,12,1449,5.53393665158371

My husband and I had never seen this show, but the cousin who gave us this gift highly recommended the series.  Well, I got hooked on the first season after watching it.  So, I purchased both Season 2 and Season 3.  I viewed the entire second season and I am on the last DVD of the third season.  This show is very cleverly done and they have been able to entice some big talent in Glenn Close, William Hurt, Ted Danson, etc.  There are many twists and turns to each plot and I can't wait now to see Season 4 when it comes out.  I would recommend this highly to viewers who really enjoy an intelligent, legal drama with lots of intrigue.",1314576000,,710,4.176470588235294

4016546,5,B002ZCY80O,"Once again DAMAGES proves why it's one of TV's finest shows.  Season 3 is a labyrynthine mix of greed, deception, lies, revelations, secrets---you name it, you got it.  Without setting one foot in the courtroom, DAMAGES is legal drama at its best.  The scripts and direction are superior, weaving intense personal subplots into the main plot.
And the acting?  Brilliant to say the least.  Glenn Close brings a complexity to Patty Hewes that transcends the usual villainess persona.  Shrewd--manipulative--ambitious--maybe even evil..but few characters on TV are as multidimensional as Patty and no one could portray her any better than Close.  Rose Byrne is equally impressive, a Patty Hewes in the making.  Byrne and Close work beautifully together.  Given a larger role this season, Tate Donovan is mesmerizing as the doomed Tom Shayes.  The guest stars this season are outstanding, especially Martin Short in a rare dramatic turn as the Tobins family attorney.  And the rest are perfect:  Campbell Scott, Ben Shankman, Ted Danson, Craig Bierko, Dominic Ciani, Timothy Olyphant, Madchen Amick, Len Cariou, Zachary Booth and of course Lily Tomlin as the Tobin matriarch.  Ensemble acting at its finest.
While MAD MEN gathers most critical accolades, DAMAGES imo is TV's best drama series.",1313971200,8,1289,5.29064039408867

I felt that season (two) was kinda repetitive and certainly less inspired that that incredibly hard to match first year . There are a pretty fair amount of absurdities in this third season . The show hugs those to its breast though and really delivers on the entertainment value . My wife and i are streaming this season and last night completed episode eight . I'm thrilled to report that Martin Short does a superb job with the first serious role i've ever seen him do . I go all the way back to SCTV with Martin . I feel it's his best work since then . Tom Noonan is brilliant as well . The whole cast is outstanding in another must have season of cliff hangers , thrills , gasps , laughs and great wit . A huge thank you to the various writers . Better than most theatrical films .",1297641600,18,999,4.128205128205129
