4129887,5,B003JLL2QS,"This is a very insightful movie.  It shows how even in the military sometimes, there is no automatic justice, and sometimes cases also are pushed forward without evidence.  Although it was sad towards the end, it was worth every penny spent on it.",1364256000,5,247,4.72093023255814

4129901,5,B003JLL2QS,"Interesting story, truth, and travesty about a young African American man accused of rape. This is based on a true story of Lori Jackson, who stands up for this man, and deals with battles along the way. It's very sad to think these things really happen, and this film shows that the justice system isn't always so justified in its convictions. These issues are just as important today as they were when this happened. Watch this for the well written story, wonderfully acted scenes, and to witness the story of Lori Jackson, whom was a hero, especially to the young man she fought to save.",1447372800,2,590,4.628571428571429

4129937,3,B003JLL2QS,I enjoy non-fiction movies.  This story has all the makings of a worthwhile movie but the casting just doesn't make it.  The acting is rather lackluster; it seemed like some of the cast members were bored & just wanted to get it over with & go home - especially the actor who played the part of the accused.  Watching this movie reminded me that a good acting performance does indeed take some skill.,1426377600,,400,4.4520547945205475

A Black Marine, Lindsey Scott,  is wrongfully accused for raping a white woman.  Lori Jackson does everything in her power to clear Scott's name.  Sadly, Ms. Jackson lost her own personal battle.
