8106971,3,B000E7UQ2Q,"I purchased this DVD for my grandson, and he watched it, but wasn't that terribly enthused.  It was a little boring for him, but he was only 2 1/2 at the time.  It wasn't quite what we expected.",1393286400,,194,4.078947368421052

8106973,5,B000E7UQ2Q,"My grandson who is 2 years old, loves big trucks and can tell you what truck they are and what they do! Perfect! He brings them when he comes over and we watch them together!",1356739200,,174,4.0
8106974,3,B000E7UQ2Q,"This video isn't what I was expecting.  There are two segments on the dvd.  The first focuses on farming rather then just tractors.  The second part is better.  It has three small segments about tractors, trucks, & trains.  The only problem is that the tractors part is pretty much redundant of the first tractors video.  My son rarely wants to watch this video.  The first segment on tractors/farming quickly loses his interest, which is surprising because he LOVES tractors.  The second one is better (he'll watch the whole thing) but it's not nearly as good as the Lots & Lots of Trucks video",1283904000,,595,4.70873786407767
8106975,1,B000E7UQ2Q,"Not even worth the $6.00 low price tag.  Kids were bored to tears. Weak production and talks down to kids. The ""Lots and Lots of Trucks"" series is much better even though it costs more you get what you pay for!",1277251200,,210,4.121951219512195
8106976,2,B000E7UQ2Q,This video is mostly tractors; few trucks were featured.  Music was so-so and production was fairly amateur.,1266019200,,108,5.352941176470588
8106977,4,B000E7UQ2Q,"I bought this DVD for my 2 year old son.  He is ALL BOY and loves trucks, dirt and all the things that go along with them, so this DVD was perfect for him.  Now driving in the car has turned into a big game of ""I Spy""",1241049600,7,217,3.5
