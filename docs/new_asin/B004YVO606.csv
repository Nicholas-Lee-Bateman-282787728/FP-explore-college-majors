4503672,5,B004YVO606,"How can you go wrong with Melrose Place when  you're looking for over-the-top drama?  The product itself was great, there was no skipping on the discs and they didn't ""stick"" at all.  Very pleased with this item.",1361750400,,212,4.675675675675675
4503673,5,B004YVO606,i love this show and i cannot believe how long it is taking for all volumes to come out!!!  this show ended at least 10 years ago :(,1356652800,,132,3.7142857142857144

4503675,5,B004YVO606,I didn't watch Melrose Place when it was on the air and cannot believe that I didn't!  This series is addicting and entertaining.,1319500800,,129,4.608695652173913
4503676,4,B004YVO606,My product came in a timely manner.  The DVD was well packaged and worth the wait.  I love Melorse Place!,1316390400,,105,4.2
4503677,5,B004YVO606,"As this cast had turned over pretty much by the 6th season, it's still the explosive, over the top writing with the new actors. I really enjoy this series as it's a favorite from when it originally aired in the 90s. I watched the second half of the season in no time of receiving it. I am amped for the 7th/final season of the series. If you're a MP fan you must continue collecting this series and season 6 is no stranger to the previous seasons. I highly recommend. Great show from the 90s to re-live once again.

Thanks for reading! Enjoy!",1313971200,4,542,4.313725490196078
4503678,4,B004YVO606,It was very interesting to see the whole gang again.  However Part 2 of this sixth zeason left out a few details that I found on another review.  I didn't see when Jennifer and Billy leave for Italy after they finally confessed their love for one another.  Will I see this at the beginning of Season 7?,1313971200,,302,4.2631578947368425
4503679,5,B004YVO606,"IM GLAD THIS WONT TAKE FOR EVER TO BE ON SALE, HOWEVER TOTALLY DISSAPOINTED THAT NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR SEASON 7 TO SEE THE END OF SOME CHARACTERS THAT LEFT THE SHOW AT THE ORIGINAL END OF SEASON 6. SEASON 6 REALLY FINISHES WITH BUONA SERA MR. CAMPBELL PART 2 WHEN ANDREW SCHUE, ALYSSA MILANO, LISA RINNA, LINDEN ASHBY AND BROOKE LANGTON LEAVE THE SHOW. HOWEVER WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR SEASON 7, DATE XX/XX/201?
AT LEAST WE CAN SEE 14 MORE EPISODES OF SEASON 6 IN THIS SECOND VOLUME :)",1304812800,3,482,4.193548387096774
4503680,5,B004YVO606,"First of all I'm pumped that these seasons are finally being released.  Most exciting is Vol. 2 of Season 6 comes only a couple months after Vol. 1.  This gives me hope that perhaps we'll have Season 7 by the end of the year.

Now, on to my gripe.  When these episodes first aired on FOX in 1998, the last chunk of Season 6 was cut away and made into a 'summer season,' as FOX had done a few times with the original BH 90210.  34 hours (there were 2 two-hour episodes for season six) were produced, with the back 7 airing as the summer season.  With baseball airing, there was only a three week stretch between the end of the summer season (technically season 6, episode 32) so I suppose that is why people consider the last seven episodes of season 6 to be part of season 7.  Oh well, I suppose they'll be part of Season 7, Vol. 1.

On to content ... I actually thoroughly enjoyed all of Season 6.  Obviously the original core of characters are gone, but the additions are great.  I think Season 7 would have been far more enjoyable if Lisa Rinna had stuck around.",1304812800,4,1065,4.227722772277228

4503682,5,B004YVO606,"Love Melrose Place, all the drama, lies, bitch-slapping, blackmail, cheating, and betrayal you'd expect. I'm so glad they put the entire series on DVD. I miss the 90s because today we are flooded with reality TV no good scripted dramas like these from the late Aaron Spelling.",1459036800,,276,4.8936170212765955

4503684,5,B004YVO606,The quality was great.  My personal opinion is they should have ended the show with season five,1447891200,,95,4.588235294117647
4503685,3,B004YVO606,"I watched every episode of course, as Beverly Hills 90210 was my favorite TV show! The acting is not good, the story lines predictable and unbelievable, but still a 90's classic that is loved by many, I won't watch the series again as I would watch reruns of 90210 any and every time, but different strokes for different folks I guess....",1441152000,,338,4.557377049180328

I also watched MP in reruns on E! from the late Summer of 1996 till the Winter of 1999 when MP was in its 7th and Final season on Fox, and then I watched it on Pop-TV from the Winter of 2015 till the Summer of 2015.",1475798400,,392,3.7804878048780486
