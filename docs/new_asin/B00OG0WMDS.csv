Each segment is taught quickly so performances are not dragged out. Also Billy, Sharon and DIO team are fun to watch.",1523491200,,251,4.478260869565218

8683414,5,B00OG0WMDS,Big fan of this couples DVD's. They always  do a great workout.  Sharon's cardio workouts are the best..  Wish she could do more.  This is my favorite of all the exercising video's I own.,1463443200,,187,4.411764705882353
8683415,2,B00OG0WMDS,"I bought this DVD as part of a boxed set. It COULD be a fun routine but there are major problems. I have over one hundred exercise DVDs. I have been doing home workouts since the 1980s. The best DVDs have both great cuing and thoughtful camera work.
If the camera is focusing on the instructor or other class members you can get by with less than excellent cuing. If the cuing is adequate, crazy camera work can be dealt with. In this DVD the camera moved all around frequently focusing on Billy and the other cast members from the waist up. It was challenging to guess what your feet should be doing. Billy's ( and his partner's ) instruction did not eliminate the guesswork. ""All In"" was, all in all, a very frustrating experience.",1453507200,6,733,4.437037037037037
