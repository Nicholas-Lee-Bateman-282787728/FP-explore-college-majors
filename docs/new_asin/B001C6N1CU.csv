8286156,5,B001C6N1CU,"Julie Goodnight's Principles of Riding - Communication and Control from the Saddle DVD gives the most detailed description of correct horsemanship body cues that I have come across.  It explains what you should be doing with your seat, legs, and hands.  You also learn how to distribute your weight correctly in stopping, turning, and going forward and backward.  In addition, it describes the use of artificial aids, including the crop, spurs, bit, etc.  Goodnight explains when to use each aid (or not)and how to most clearly articulate them to your horse partner, so you can achieve the best communication and control from the saddle.  This video is well worth the price, and I like that Goodnight makes her videos affordable by allowing the purchase of each one singly.  Many DVDs that could be valuable to the horseman are sold as a $400 or more set, making them out of reach to the ordinary person (except in little pieces on RFD T.V.).  This DVD further clarified many of the principles I learned through riding lessons in the last eight months. I highly recommend it.",1381622400,,1075,4.841530054644808
8286157,3,B001C6N1CU,This is a good video for people who are just beginning or haven't rode much. I did take away some good info though.,1363651200,,115,4.043478260869565
