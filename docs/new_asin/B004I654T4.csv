8430131,4,B004I654T4,"Bedrooms is an evocative drama about the walls that separate people, the heartbreak and infidelity that are often the result and the redemption that is possible when we choose to speak the truth and tear those walls down.

A unique collaboration among a collective of independent filmmakers, Bedrooms is told in four distinct stories set in four bedrooms. In one story, Moon Bloodgood ( Terminator Salvation ) and Jordan Belfi ( Entourage ) play a husband and wife at the critical turning point of their young relationship. In another, Julie Benz ( Dexter ) and Xander Berkeley ( Terminator 2: Judgment Day ) are a husband and wife desperately trying to recover from infidelity, while Jesse Garcia ( Quinceaera ) plays a pizza delivery boy who unwittingly becomes the catalyst for the ultimate resolution of their marital conflict.

In the third story, Dee Wallace ( E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial ) and Barry Bostwick ( Spin City ) play a retired couple coming to the end of a long and unusual extra-marital affair. And in the last story, Sarah Clarke ( Twilight ) plays a recently divorced mother of 10 year old twins who decide to create their own separate spaces in the room they share by building a wall out of all their toys.

Bedrooms is a comic, sweet and gut wrenching exploration of human relationships, their myriad complications and the daily choice we face to either make them work or to move on.",1391558400,,1406,4.777777777777778

8430133,5,B004I654T4,"This film is amazing, everyone would identify with at least one of the characters or one of the situations. This film is a very personal reflection about love, life and relationships. The story is about how selfish or afraid we are and how it can affect not only the relation with ourselves but with our partners and how then we try to deal with it. You may feel confronted by this movie but it is a relief when you see how universal are issues that we believe only happen to us. You will enjoy it!",1296777600,4,498,4.252631578947368
