5948525,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"OMG.  Finally a decent lesbian flick.  I thought the acting was good and the story believable.  I think I got my ""happy ending"".",1388793600,,128,4.478260869565218
5948526,4,B00EVKQ2YS,"I thought it was a good movie. I enjoyed the main character...somewhat cheezy acting at times by supporting characters, but overall good pick.",1388620800,2,142,5.217391304347826
5948527,4,B00EVKQ2YS,This movie is nice. It has good drama and character development. It is nice that being lesbian is not the entire focus of the movie and is just a normal part of the various character's lives.,1388016000,4,191,4.333333333333333
5948528,4,B00EVKQ2YS,"Margarita is a good example of entertaining and intelligent indepenent film making. Here you find a great story competent actors and a charismatic lead actress.  What a delight to find a story where the main character is a lesbian, but the story involves so many more issues.  Margarita is an illegal immigrant in Canada and the family  she has worked for are letting her go after 6 years, so she need to get married or be deported.  This dilemma she faces gives rise to both dramatic and comedic plot development which is very satisfyingly resolved. What a great country Canada is, where same sex marriage is legal, if only Australia,  where I live was as enlightened!",1387670400,7,669,4.732758620689655
5948529,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"I like this movie, it was entertaining and funny at times. I like the happy endings. A lot of lesbian movies have a sad/bitter ending- not this one.",1386979200,,148,4.321428571428571
5948530,5,B00EVKQ2YS,Positive Movie with great acting and  alot of love. Endearing. Main actor is beautiful which doesn't hurt. thoroughly enjoyed and recommended to others.,1386806400,,152,5.608695652173913
5948531,3,B00EVKQ2YS,"I thought this film lacked character development and depth.  The dialogue and the acting felt superficial and forced.  Ironically, the friendship most believable and genuine appeared to be between Margarita and Carlos. Nicola Correia Damude's Magarita came across as a sincere and very likable character and she,a very capable actress.  As with many lesbian films, content and character development was replaced with gratuitous sex scenes that neither developed the plot nor the character.

I was confused how a family that lived with and ""loved"" Margarita for six years; treated her like family, could devolve and crumble the way they did in this film.  I think the crumbling is possible, given the circumstances, but the story itself didnt't translate well to the screen because of the superficial acting.  The story is a good one and makes an earnest effort to illuminate the struggles illegal immigrants face in this country.  I expected more from this film and was left feeling a little disappointed.",1386720000,7,1005,5.204968944099379
5948532,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"Well made, acting was really good and it was a lovely movie that didn't make a huge deal out of the fact that Margarita is a lesbian.",1384819200,3,133,3.962962962962963
5948533,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"The movie is replete with deep social dilemmas, yet they come together beautifully.  Great acting, music, and hilarious lines...truly enjoyed this.",1383350400,2,147,6.0
5948534,4,B00EVKQ2YS,"A heart felt lesbian comedy. Although the movie covers the serious topic of illegal immigration, the off beat characters make the film very funny. The only truely sane on of the household is Margarita. I enjoyed watching this film.",1405900800,,231,4.948717948717949
5948535,1,B00EVKQ2YS,"this was just a waste of time... disappointing, childish, the kind of stuff I cancelled cabel to get away from.",1403049600,,111,4.6
5948536,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"I had wanted to see this film. i was hoping it wold not be another formulaic lesbian movie. It was not and I was very happy about that. This is a great, thoughtful film that looks not just at lesbians in romantic situations but at people in normal situations of daily life. It examines how things and people are often not what they seem and the lies they tell themselves and each other in order to maintain the lives they have created when full disclosure is no longer an option. And the story is told with an honest, candid voice that made it that much more credible. The couple who employ the title character are feckless, shallow yuppies whose identity is more tightly tied to their suburban home than to any moral compass. In contrast the title character is a hardworking person whose status as an undocumented person serves as the backdrop for her struggle to live up to her own moral and ethical standards. As the finances of the family she lives with unravels we get a glimpse into the hypocrisy that is often the price of affluence-real or perceived. That's a tall order for a dramedy but this film pulls it off by letting the characters various stories be what they are-complicated, compromised and riddled with contradictions. And yet interspersed with genuine love and affection. just like real life. The ending was a tinsy bit sappy but I could not fault them for that. All in all a very lovely film I will watch again.",1401494400,,1431,4.571984435797665
5948537,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"I admit that I had low expectations for this film.  After reading some of the reviews and after having just seen Concussion, I figured this movie was just another piece of garbage.

But I couldn't have been more wrong!  I cannot wait to watch it again.  The main character, Margarita, is rip-roaring funny.  She has a pleasant accent and a sarcastic wit that kept me laughing.  Nicole Correia-Damude, who played ""Margarita"", absolutely sold this movie!!!  Her performance is AMAZING!!!  Patrick McKenna and Maya Ritter also did superbly, and their performances really helped bring the movie together.

The story is relatable given the current worldwide economical turmoil.  Many people/families have found themselves in similar circumstances and are forced to resort to drastic measures.  This background isn't meant to imply that the movie is ""heavy"" in any way.  The directors were able to keep the movie light through comedy.  The story still makes the audience think about immigration issues and the effect of difficult financial times on families, marriages, children, and employment relationships.

The chemistry between Margarita and her girlfriend Jane was iffy.  I think that the directors should have cast someone else as Jane because Christine Horne's performance wasn't really memorable.  However, Nicole Correia-Damude, playing ""Margarita"", had enough passion for both of them.

Bravo on an excellent movie!  I'm glad that I bought it.  As far as I'm concerned, it is tied for 1st place with ""Kiss Me"" and ""Out At The Wedding"".",1398038400,3,1540,5.289256198347108
5948538,1,B00EVKQ2YS,"I commonly look at the rating &  reviews,  they are pretty accurate most the time. I don't know why this movie was rated with four stars.... It was just alright.",1397347200,,161,4.333333333333333
5948539,3,B00EVKQ2YS,"The plot wasn't rich enough for me, but it was an okay flick.  The chemistry between the nanny and her lover wasn't believable until the end.",1392681600,,141,4.423076923076923
5948540,5,B00EVKQ2YS,A fun watch. Nicely layered tale with a cute ending. The filming and acting was done well also.  I liked this a great deal. Enjoy,1392249600,,129,4.16
5948541,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"The lesbian main character's sexuality is beside the point.

She has both straight and gay people in her life that love her. No one has a problem or issue with her lifestyle, which is refreshing.

The dialog is humorous.  The characters have common foibles but are at their heart, kind and loving.",1390176000,,297,4.673076923076923
5948542,5,B00EVKQ2YS,"Margarita is a Nanny to a high flying couple with a fourteen year old daughter. She has been with them a number of years and seems to do everything for them as well as being the daughters best friend, teacher and confidante. She is also a lesbian and has a girlfriend who seems to want to keep her at arms length outside of their physical relationship. Well the couple Ben and Gail have had a run of bad luck in the cash flow department. A string of bad investments and bad career choices has left them financially embarrassed.

Well they have to make cutbacks and so they have to think the unthinkable and let Margarita go. Margarita, meanwhile, has spotted the slide in their fortunes and has been doing economy measures for some time, as well as fixing computes, mending the gutter, clearing the drive and servicing the hot tub  she is also drop dead gorgeous. Well once they have told her that she has to go the consequences for everyone become very apparent, very quick  and thats when they find out she is also an illegal immigrant.

This is just a wonderful film, Nicola Correia Damude (Havana 57) as Margarita is sensational but a special word has to be said for Patrick McKenna as Ben who is marvellous, funny, and an all round entertainer who you cant help feeling sorry for him even when he is trying to fire Margarita. Everyone is great in this and the direction is excellent from Dominique Cardona and Laurie Colbert they worked together before on Finns Girl so they knew they could deliver and deliver they have in absolute spades. One of the best films I have seen for ages and I can not recommend highly enough  a comedy with social comment and a bucket of human emotion and its Canadian  what is not to like?",1389484800,3,1725,4.49520766773163
