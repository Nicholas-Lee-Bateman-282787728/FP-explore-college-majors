2169712,1,B00065QG84,"BUY SOMETHING ELSE!

For $31 (including shipping) I got Air Alert from its website.  The 40 page black and white ""training manual"" looks like a video game instruction book.  It describes 6 jumping excercises and prescribes doing these exercies 3 times a week for ridiculous reps.  For example, in week 7 you do 350 ""burn outs"".  The training will create muscle imbalance and many people have injured themselves from it.

The DVD may as well be a highlight reel from 1980s and 1990s NCAA games.  I think the author bought rights to these NCAA highlights even though the players didn't use or endorse Air Alert.  It even features Michael Jordan at North Carolina.  Between dunks, the DVD tells you to ""eat 3 meals a day including carbs, protein, and calcium"" and tells you to ""play with your mind and body"".  Stupid and simple.  I can't make this stuff up.  It shows the 6 exercises it prescribes for ridiculous (40, 50, etc) reps then tells you to do leg curls on a leg machine after advertising that the program only uses your body weight (but weights aren't part of the program).  Basically worthless.

The program is 15 weeks long and the only way you can get your ""money back"" is to complete the program and fill out all the workout logs then send it back (after 15 weeks).  Yeah right.  How many people actually remember to send it in?  The AUTHOR IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A PERSONAL TRAINER AND HAS NO CLUE WHAT HE'S PRESCRIBING.  Save yourself $31.  Buy ""Jumping into Plyometrics"" or ""Training for Speed and Agility"" for $15 each or just look up exercises on the net and do them for QUALITY EXPLOSIVE REPS (I only do 10 reps of 10 exercises 2x a week and still have a 34 inch vertical and I'm over 30 years old).

There are many better programs!  Air Alert sucks.",1258416000,19,1761,4.5094936708860756
2169713,5,B00065QG84,I purchased product for my son. He decide to let the whole basketball team use it as part of their workout.,1242000000,,107,4.142857142857143
2169714,1,B00065QG84,"I remember doing this religiously at age 14.  My vertical didn't improve at all.  These exercises don't work the large leg muscles nearly enough....there's too much emphasis on the calves, which are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of jumping.  Just do box jumps and jump squats.",1241222400,2,283,4.73469387755102
2169715,3,B00065QG84,"i definitely cant say its the best system for increasing your vertical, but it definitely worked for me. i went from just touching backboard to getting wrist above the rim. and my stamina and explosive step increased tremendously. but you really do have to do weights as well, which it doesnt really specify. the problem is that as the weeks go by the amount of time needed to put into it is pretty long (eventually 2 hrs long minimum) and thats not counting the weight workouts. also i did notice with some of the guys i did it with did get into some issues with their knees and ankles. all in all not bad.",1234051200,,607,4.333333333333333
2169716,1,B00065QG84,"This program is a waste of money and time, I got suckered into this as well as the many others who bought this. It is all endurance(barely), a good way to put strain on your knee, and it does not tell you that you HAVE to strengthen your legs in the weight room as well as doing the program. Honestly, you should not waste your time. You would be better off buying the anything else that includes plyometrics AND weight training.",1231027200,6,429,4.308641975308642
2169717,5,B00065QG84,I used this program back when i was in high school and it worked for me.  After i got done i was prolly in the best shape of my life and at 5'10 was only about a inch away from dunking.,1161129600,2,185,3.5121951219512195
2169718,1,B00065QG84,"I've tried the air alert II program before and I did not see any dramatic improvement in my jumping ability. I probably gained 1 inch but that was probably because of the pounds of bodyweight I lost doing the program. They ask you to do a high volume of jumps continuously and in effect, you're doing an endurance program. Instead of improving your power, you're just imrpoving your stamina, which is probably a good thing...if you were training for the marathon!!! There are a lot of better programs out there. Word of advice, don't buy into gimicks, gadgets or special shoes if you want to jump higher. There is no magic pill to get a high vertical. The secret to a high vertical lies in sound and scientific training. If you are really serious in becoming an elite athlete, get a hold of Mel Siff's ""Supertraining."" However, I must warn you that it is not an easy read. It's more of a textbook on training rather than a resource of cookie-cutter strength programs like most training books. For beginners in the strength and sports training game, I recommend the ""Vertical Jump Bible"" by Kelly Bagget. It contains more or less everything you need to know on how to setup a complete program for maximum vertical leap and speed.",1160524800,6,1228,4.637614678899083
2169719,4,B00065QG84,"Without a doubt Air Alert works.  For a novice athlete or gym-goer the program will still work even though you might have done most of the exercises like calf raises, squat hops, step ups, etc that the program requires you to execute three times a week.  A person with no leg workout experience in the past will benefit the most from this program.  I have trained my legs for over a year before starting Air Alert, but I still gained some ups from this program and I'm only on week 4 out of 15.  I would guesstimate 1-2 inches already, though it guarantee's 8-14, I am not expecting that in the least.  I went from getting high on the net to getting higher on the net, still not touching rim.  The program might tear apart your joints and knees, so do the exercises on soft floors like carpet or grass to reduce impact.  Definitely worth a shot, but it is not made for the weak that will quit after 3-4 days of using it.",1148947200,13,920,4.252873563218391
8039068,5,B00065QG84,I completed AA2  in high school back in the late 90's. It increase my vertical 6 inches to 33 in 6 weeks. No BS. I stopped because I was dunking.  I gave it to my friend and he was jumping out the gym because he did the whole program. No lie. This small investment is well worth it. It will change your life.,1426636800,3,308,3.873015873015873
8039069,3,B00065QG84,I quit it after 2 weeks didn't feel difference and I feel like it's a waste of time,1413331200,,83,3.6666666666666665

8039071,5,B00065QG84,"I really do not understand all the negative comments. If you actually commit to the program--do every rep of every set correctly, eat like you actually care, and drink protein after-- you will have great results. It is not too often that you see a 5'9"" guy playing up near the rim.",1371513600,3,281,4.423076923076923
8039072,2,B00065QG84,"1. WENT I FIRST TRY AIR ALERT I WAS ABOUT 19YEAR OLD AND GAIN 8INCH.My STANDING REACH WAS 90INCH AND HEIGHT WAS 5,10 HIS WAS AIR ALERT 2 AT THE TIME.MY START VERTICAL JUMP WAS 24INCH THAT WENT TO 32INCH.I GIVE A FIVE.

2. AIR ALERT 5 REVIEW AT 33 YEAR OLD. THE PROGRAM DID IMPROVE MY EDDURANCE, BUT ONLY GIVE ME ABOUT 2INCH I GIVE A 2.

3. IF YOU DECIDE TO BUY AIR ALERT STRENGTH FOR ABOUT 6 MONTH FIRST.

CONCLUSION:AIR  ALERT IS FOR PEOPLE  BETWEEN THE AGE OF 14 AND 30 YEAR OLD AND NOT FOR PEOLPE OVERE THE AGE OF 3O YEAR OLD.

4. RECOMMENDATION IS TO STRENGTH FOR ABOUT SIX MONTH AND WATCHING STRENGTH CAMP ON YOUTUBE BY ELLIO. WENT YOU FINISH STRENGTH FOR SIX MONTH I RECOMMENDATION WATCH JACK JUMP OUT THE GYM VIDEO I GAIN ABOUT 6IN TO VERTICAL JUMP.",1370995200,,756,4.108843537414966
8039073,1,B00065QG84,"So i got this program awhile ago and thought if I did it I would become a beast (when i got it i didn't know how much of a scam it is) I got through the first week and halfway through the second week i got sharp pains in my back. I went to my doctor and she told me my spinal discs had where compressed,i also had minor pains in my left knee, so I had to quite basketball and track to go to physical therapy for two months which during that time i couldn't play football, which really pissed me off.(and i had done all the exersises on soft wood floor with carpet over it) so during my two months of therapy i looked up everything there is to know about REAL training and REAL SCAMS. and AIR ALERT IS THE BIGGEST SCAM ON THE MARKET.  it says by doing hundreds and hundreds sometimes almost one thousand reps you will build muscle, when you should be doing 10-20 explosive reps to build muscle they say ""improve running speed naturally and without the use of any weights, gimmicky equipment or unsafe supplements.""
they say no use of weights but yet in the program it reccomends doing leg raises on a weight machine. they say no gimmicky equipment but they package a pair of flimsy ""court controllers"" which are absolutly worthless. and one of the most unsfae things is they tell you to do your jumps on a sturdy chair, you should never ever stand on chairs much less jump up and down on them. they also say it will guarantee you 8-14 inches on your vertical. no program can guarantee you a set number, you get what you put in (note: all good training programs will never say you will gain X# of inches or X# of bench press, they will all tell you that you get what you give)oh yea... and the creator Tim Turkel who claims he trains elite athletes of all kind, well why don't you guys google him right now... so you see he doesnt even exist (exept that guy with the facebook) but now google a real trainer like Allan Stein... you will get his webpage and info allover him. now im not promoting him im just saying you caan see the difference of a real trainer and a cut and paste SCAM!!!!!!!!!! the nba ""endorsers"" don't endorse this program. I have seen Baron Davis's workout program with his trainer and not a single air alert exersice is on their. it seems childish to even think an elite athlete like baron davis would be doing these six little exercises for his leg workout. if you want to see prof of what REAL elite athletic training is go to playerworkouts.com and you will see what the pros actually do. not this crap. i could rant on and on about how terrible of a program but ill just leave it at that",1353283200,2,2610,4.262096774193548
8039074,2,B00065QG84,"The product is okay... I've tested it while my friend tested another well known training and at the end of 2 months I gained ~3 inches while he gained ~8 inches. Was kinda disappointed at the results but it works. I didn't gain anything close to the amount that it promised though which is 8-14 inches.

I'm now trying the product my friend is using and will update with results in a few months. If any of you want to try a different training program, try

8039075,5,B00065QG84,"This does exactly what it says it will. It will increase vertical jumping ability without fail. the drills are easy to do, the video is very good and easy to follow. if you jump Higher and be more explosive this video will help you get there.",1300665600,2,242,4.282608695652174
8039076,1,B00065QG84,"I'm writing a review because I don't want others to go through with the injury that I've had after doing this program.  I gained about an inch or two while doing it, but I had to stop during my 4th of 5th week due to my knees hurting and swelling up.  My right knee felt like it was going to give.  I gained some inches and endurance, but eventually had major set backs like sitting out due to knee problems.  I had an MRI done that thank God showed no signs of tears on any of my ligaments, but the pain and swelling has been there ever since I did this program in 2008.  I never had knee problems before, but since doing Air Alert it all changed.  Wish I had read reviews about this before I set out doing it.  But for all of you that are curious, this review is a warning.  I'm a weekend warrior and I want you all to stay the same and injured free.  So with that said, good luck!  Research, try other plyometric programs, not this one. Hope this helps.",1285545600,5,956,4.064171122994653
8039077,1,B00065QG84,"Air Alert is fundamentally flawed.  Developing a strong vertical jump requires a foundation that is based on strength and the expression of that strength which comes through explosive and reactive exercises.  Think of strength as the foundation for your home and explosive and reactive exercises as the house itself (which rests on the foundation).  Air Alert leaves the first part of the formula(strength)out of the equation.  As far as reactive and explosive drills are concerned, the plyometric drills prescribed are not bad per se, but the application is terrible.  Training to do thousands of jumps will make you an ENDURANCE jumper not an explosive high jumper.  For those of you who don't know, Air Alert makes you do literally thousands of jumps.  What's more, without a fundamental base of strength, all the plyometrics in the world will not have you significantly increasing your vertical.

If you look at the ""studies"" that Air Alert has conducted you will notice that the participants are under 15 years old.  Any athlete that young will notice an increase in his vertical by simply growing and becoming naturally stronger.  That's how garbage programs like this can claim some sort of success.  You can see some results from Air Alert but that's likely due to not being a trained athlete (anything is better than nothing.  The point is, if you follow Air Alert to the tee you will not see great results or at least not the results you could from a program that has sound principles.  It's also worth noting that the high volume of jumps can be a danger on your joints.

To summarize, to jump higher you must have a strong base of strength, (think squats) and express that strength in explosive and reactive ways (plyometrics and hang cleans for example).  Air Alert fails at both ends.

I have used Air Alert and saw minimal gains.  I switched over to the Jump Manual and have seen great results.  I have also read and would recommend the Vertical Jump Bible or a free site, called ""Free to Fly"" [...].  I point out that the creators of Jump Manual, Vertical Jump Development Bible and Free to Fly all have pictures and/or videos of them dunking whereas the creator of Air Alert, Timur Tukel, has a bio talking about how he wants to sell this jump program to your kids.

Jumping around all day three times a week won't help you dunk a ball.  Strengthening your legs and expressing that strength will.  Don't waste 15 weeks of your life on this.",1270598400,13,2457,4.731764705882353
