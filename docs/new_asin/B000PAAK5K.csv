2814858,5,B000PAAK5K,"Setting aside That's Dancing this is once again a superb set from the golden age of MGM. All films are of the high standard we have come to expect of these remastered greats from a period in cinemaa history when entertainment was exactly that. You don't need to sit and think,just sit and enjoy. The extras as usual are quite good and the short subjects/cartoons as enjoyable as ever. Whilst That's Dancing is not strictly from the golden age it does contain many items that are and therefore can rightly be included. I was just a little suprised that Two Lanza films were included as surely this geat star deserves a set all of his own. I only hope that they will continue with this series format and give us even more even some of the old black and white movies with stars such as Jeanette MacDonald & Nelson Eddy or Jane Powell and how about rounding out the Broadway Melody series with a set containing B'Way Melody of 1936 & 1938. Warner/TCM might also like to consider a Biog set with The Helen Morgan Story/I'll Cry Tomorrow/Deep In My Heart/Rhapsody In Blue/Shine On Harvest Moon/Look For The Silver Lining/The Eddie Cantor Story/So This Is Love to name but a few. As long as they prodeuce them on DVD I will certainly keep on buying them. They are Hollywood History at it's entertaining best.",1187136000,6,1301,4.564102564102564
2814859,4,B000PAAK5K,"Latest roundup of Technicolor features from MGM's heyday of musicals...most on DVD for the first time.  PIRATE has Judy Garland and Gene Kelly in a fun romp set to Cole Porter tunes, directed by visual master Minnelli, who was Garland's husband at the time.  WORDS AND MUSIC is a mostly-fictional biography of master tunesmiths Richard Rodgers (Tom Drake) and Lorenz ""Larry"" Hart (Mickey Rooney).  Worth a look for the great songs (better served, though, in Columbia's version of Pal Joey from about 10 years later).  KISS and ORLEANS feature singing stars Mario Lanza and Kathryn Grayson on one double-feature disc.  Includes the 2005 BBC documentary Mario Lanza: Singing to the Gods - a reminder that the man who was the greatest American operatic tenor of the mid-20th century (his records outsold Sinatra's) really didn't have an opera career at all (and died at age 38).  Another double feature is WEDDING and BELLE, both with Fred Astaire.  The first features Fred's famous dancing-on-the-ceiling number (still impressive), which helps you forget that Jane Powell, 30 years his junior, is playing his sister; and BELLE is a pretty hokey effort (almost worth sitting through the first hour for Vera-Ellen's Extreme Makeover from Salvation-Army-type good girl to vamp in a black evening gown even Beyonce might find too much).  DANCING is another clips-compilation followup to the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! hits of the mid-70s, concentrating on dance numbers from the silent era through Michael Jackson videos.  There's even a section on ballet hosted by Mikhail Baryshnikov.  Don't look for MGM's most famous dance clips, though (""Singin' in the Rain,"" etc.) - they were already used in That's Entertainment.  Still, very enjoyable.",1184544000,4,1733,5.265454545454546
2814860,5,B000PAAK5K,"This is the second volume of MGM Dream Factory musicals. Only ""That's Dancing"" and ""Royal Wedding"" are on DVD already, and those are generally poor public domain copies. The other five features have only been on VHS up to now. I'd put all of these movies except ""Belle of New York"" at between four and five stars if you are a fan of the MGM musicals of the 40's and 50's. ""Belle of New York"" I'd put at between three and four stars mainly because the campiness of the entire production gets in the way most of the time. Considering you expect some gimmicks in MGM musicals of this era, that is saying a lot. The extra features, which I got from a press release from Warner Home Video, do look good. This package probably rates 4.5 stars taken as a whole, and I round it up to five. The following are brief descriptions of the films and the special features for each one.

The Pirate (1948) Starring Gene Kelly and Judy Garland. Features music by Cole Porter. A swashbuckling tale is largely just a framework for the music and dancing, which is excellent. Judy Garland plays a girl obsessed with a legendary pirate. Gene Kelly pretends to be that pirate in order to get the girl. This film actually lost money for MGM in its initial release. Today it is interesting because it showcases the talents of Gene Kelly and Judy Garland so well.

That's Dancing! (1985) is a documentary along the same lines as ""That's Entertainment"" narrated by Gene Kelly along with co-hosts Ray Bolger, Sammy Davis Jr., Mikhail Baryshnikov and Liza Minnelli. The clips of dancing in motion pictures from the 30's to the 80's are very good, but the presentation was lacking somewhat. The narration seems deadpan, and when the narration cuts into the actual dancing numbers it is distracting more than informative.

Words and Music (1948) features lots of stars as themselves performing to the music of Rodgers and Hart. This is a totally fictional account of the lives and careers of Rodgers and Hart. In 1948 the true story would have never made it past the censors, but then the commentary is supposed to clear all of that up.

That Midnight Kiss (1949) Starring Kathryn Grayson and Mario Lanza. This is another MGM musical with a great supporting cast that largely exists for the sake of the music, not the plot. There are some great operatic performances by Lanza who is starring in what turns out to be a pseudo-autobiography.

Toast Of New Orleans (1950) Starring Kathryn Grayson and Mario Lanza. This time Lanza is a fisherman when his talent as a singer is discovered, and he and Grayson are in New Orleans, thus the title. This is a light breezy film with touches of comedy, delivered somewhat surprisingly by Lanza.

Royal Wedding (1951) Starring Fred Astaire and Jane Powell. My favorite film of the group. A brother and sister act perform in England at the time of then Princess Elizabeth's wedding. They both fall in love, thus breaking up the act. This has Astaire's famous performance in which he dances on the walls and ceiling of his London hotel room.

The Belle of New York (1952) Starring Fred Astaire and Vera-Ellen. This is actually a disappointing film considering Astaire is in it. Although Astaire dances more in this film than in most of the others he made, it is just hard to get past the campiness of it all - literally dancing on air, dancing on a horse's back, etc. There is some great music from  Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer, though.

2814877,4,B000PAAK5K,"Watching these films again, in the best restorations ever available, it is fun to reassign their status in the MGM musical pantheon.  That Midnight Kiss, the first and now I think the most entertaining of the Mario Lanza musicals, gets new status for me.  The Toast of New Orleans is slow to start and features an already plumper Lanza en route to Brandoland!  The Belle of New York is a trifle but a trifle is a dessert and it is full of charming moments.  Vera Ellen was never presented to better advantage while Fred Astaire, having some fun out of tails, looks more like Buster Keaton than Cary Grant's closest rival for best tailored movie actor.  The Pirate is just short of wonderful which is very disappointing.  Except for the score and a couple of novelty dances Royal Wedding is a dud.  Stanley Donen's lack of experience as a director combined with the bad casting of a competent but not starry Sarah Churchill make you wonder why they didn't cast Margaret Truman in the Jane Powell role and have a truly puzzling historical document.  That's Dancing is primarily tedious to a video generation that can see anything it so chooses.  Words and Music has Hart (and Rodgers) but lacks truth and heart.",1191542400,4,1209,4.665094339622642
2814878,4,B000PAAK5K,"The Pirate turns out to be the best of the bunch.  I can't understand why it failed at the box office.  Garland and kelly are both delightfully entertaining; not only that their song and dance numbers are great fun to watch their acting skills are first rate too!  Gene Kelly's swashbuckling character is superbly agile; if he's not a better dancer than Fred Astaire, more athletic aside, he definitely is more colorful.  Judy Garland's song number under spell reminds me of her in the Fiegfeld Follies where she is also under a different kind of spell, someone drunk by (or in) her own legendary status,  which she was so good in it, if I'm not wrong, she was even nominated for an oscar, am I right? No?  And last but not least the sight and sound are fantastic, especially, the picture clean and clear, brilliant!

I was anxiously expecting to see and hear Kathryn Grayson's opera arias outing but rather disappointed, expecially, in 'That Midnight Kiss'; because, every time she sings she is hampered by some emotional conflict restricted by the plot.  Fortunately, I get to hear at least three arias  unimpeded by the meddlesome story line in 'The Toast of new Orleans',  talking about story line, there isn't much in both films.  The three arias  from 'Linda di Chamounix', 'Mignon', and 'La Traviata' if somewhat truncated are beautifully sung, but I'm surprised that she didn't end the first two arias in high C's, maybe higher than C's, anyway, thay always call a high note a high C.  I always thought Kathryn Grayson is a very high coloratura, this is rather odd that she didn't hit the hell out of it, I mean the high C's.  Mario Lanza?  What can I say, everyone says he is a legend, one of the great. I have to admit that besides opera, he sings other kinds of music very well too, that is quite unusual.  The only other opera singer that is also very good in pop tunes is soprano Eileen Farrell who is widely recognized as a great American soprano, but I have not yet heard her in popular music.  Well, between 'That Midnight Kiss' and 'The Toast of New Orleans', I like the latter better.  Not only there are more opera arias, the story is more colorful and interesting too.  However, one complaint have to be made, the duet from 'Madama Butterfly' is again dictated by the plot that the fisherman finally realizes that he has been overdoing the high society etiquette that causes reverse effect, so that he decides to make amend in this duet by throwing the cigartte defiedly and grabs the arms of Butterfly and tries to kiss her and Butterfly is alarmed and tries to resist him.  This is totally opposed to the plot of the opera, whereas Butterfly would melt into the arms of Pinkerton.  Otherwise, it would have been a wonderful performance from both of them and again it is only the last half of the duet that is performed, well, what do you expect from musicals.  I can tell that the MGM had been trying very hard to make popular the high art of opera.  It's not an easy task I suppose.

'Words and Music', I can only say, mediocre. 'That's Dancing' is Okay, as for 'Royal Wedding' and 'The Belle of New York' both are disappointing.

Now I'm waiting for my interest income  to be deposited in my bank account the end of this month to buy the the first volume of Classic Musicals from the Dream Factory.  See you.",1189728000,5,3332,4.5376884422110555
2814879,5,B000PAAK5K,"If for no other reason, THE PIRATE is reason enough to buy this classic set of musicals.  Nothing else in the collection measures up to the brilliance of this Cole Porter gem.  The direction by Vincent Minnelli is witty.  Both Judy Garland and Gene Kelly are at their most sophisticated and charming.  Judy was never better on sceen than when she co-starred with Gene, and this magical film is proof of that.  When it was released it wasn't the hit it should have been, but now contemporary audiences can enjoy the film in all its brilliance.
The other movies in the collection aren't up to THE PIRATE, but they all have moments of great MGM magic.  Anyone who loves musicals from the Golden Age should get this collection.  THAT'S DANCING is a nice bonus to highlight the importance of dance in MGM musicals.",1189728000,3,809,4.615384615384615
2814880,4,B000PAAK5K,"Another fine product from Warners, this time including material considered excellent examples of MGM at its peak and some not so excellent.  Although Words and Music may not be a true representation of Rodgers and Hart's life, the musical numbers are top notch and the movie is entertaining. The Pirate, with its stigma for being a failure upon initial release, is a pleasure to watch and to hear as well.  The stars are excellent, although Judy Garland looks a bit nervous in several scenes.  Royal Wedding is very entertaining and while not a great film is an example of movie-making that makes you feel good.  The Belle of New York is difficult to watch.  It has to be the worst of the Fred Astaire films, and the problems include the story, the musical numbers, and,unfortunately, his co-star.  I had never seen That's Dancing and was surprised at how few clips from musical films were used and how dated the movie itself was.  The That's Entertainment films hold up much better and seem to be more professionaly produced.  All said, the packaging and the extras are nice, as with most of the wonderful products from Warners.  Actually it's difficult to be negative about the level of craftsmanship from MGM and its stars back in the day, but some musicals are just better than others.",1189036800,15,1289,4.744394618834081

I got a little over an hour of ""The Pirate"" and ""That Midnight Kiss.""  ""Words and Music"" would not play at all.  ""That's Dancing"" played for a little over twenty minutes.
