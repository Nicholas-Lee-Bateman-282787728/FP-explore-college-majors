The fine folks at Cult Epics keep hitting home runs with the movies they find to release on Blu-ray.  Im very impressed theyve chosen several of Jorg Buttgereits titles, as most of them are quite controversial in nature.  Buttgereit, if you didn't already know, is the brainchild behind some of the most disturbing films of the 80s and 90s, including NEKROMANTIK and THE DEATH KING.  SCHRAMM is a lesser-known title from the directors filmography, but it is a strong film that horror fans will definitely want to check out.  And while not as shocking as his previous works, the film still packs quite a proverbial punch.

I wasn't sure what to expect with SCHRAMM.  Id heard of it, but the film doesnt quite have the reputation as some of Buttgereits other work.  Still, I found SCHRAMM very entertaining and disturbing, a wickedly fun glimpse into the mind of a madman.

SCHRAMM is shot well, in Buttgereits signature semi-monochromatic style.  The HD transfer looks crisp for the most part; I ran into only a couple of scenes with grainy images.  I imagine this stems from a lack of lighting during those scenes and not from shoddy camera equipment.

The acting is good, with Florian Koerner von Gustorf portraying the titular serial killer.  Von Gustorf does a stunning job as a chilling loner who randomly kills people.  Surprisingly, this is one of only three acting credits he has had in his career.  He is joined by the beautiful Monica M., who fans will remember from the NEKROMANTIK series.

The special effects are gruesome and realistic for the most part.  The sole exception is when blood is splattering on the wall during one of Schramms killings.  The blood we see looks like red water; it is not thick at all, and looks more comical than anything.  But the rest of the gore we get is good, particularly when Schramm is nailing his penis to the table.  THAT is a gut-wrenching sight, and I had to turn away a time or two.

SCHRAMM is darkly fun and entertaining, and fans of surreal horror should enjoy it.  I recommend giving it a look, especially on Blu-ray.",1466380800,,2147,4.669333333333333
8750614,3,B01BLY6SGI,It is old school disturbing now the gore in the films is more disturbing not really standing the test of time for me.,1463184000,,117,4.130434782608695
8750615,5,B01BLY6SGI,"First off I have to say that Cult Epics is one of the finest companies out there, bringing out and expressing wonderful pieces of cinema by many thought provoking visionaries. From erotic to hardcore violence, Cult Epics is a company of mastery in giving fans wonderful examples of both Blu-ray's and DVD's. Schramm is another fine example of that top quality that Cult Epics stands for.

Schramm is a film directed by one of the most disturbing visionaries ever to grace the cinema world. Jorg Buttgereit is an acquired taste. His films are bloody, disgusting and most of all brilliant. When I learned that Schramm was coming to Blu-ray, I was super happy. What is interesting about Schramm, comparing it to his other films, this one is less in the gore factor, but that does not mean its sanity, because it clearly is disturbing and very shocking in the brutality reality, and has lots of gore.. This has a running time of a little over an hour. Its about a serial killer named Lothar Schramm. Schramm has a sadistic temper and urge to kill whoever is around him.

One has to be a Jorg fan, to understand, and appreciate this style of film making. There are moments of total bloody rampage, gore. There are moments of artistic imagery in a dream like twisted reality that sends the viewer into a world that only Jorg can create.

I first became aware of Jorg Buttgereits visionary work with his disturbing, twisted, gut wrenching masterpiece Nekromantik. I was 11 years old, shocked, and it forever has stood with me, and is a film that remains in my nightmares. I am a huge fan of his work. He is ultimately a unique, fresh visionary that understands, and knows the world of horror, the inner-recesses of nightmares, and the fine line between sanity and insanity. His work is one of kind. Cult Epics did a great job in honoring this master, with this wonderful Blu-ray.

Starring as your main character is an actor that in my viewpoint is brilliant. He was able to capture insanity with a mastery that is hard to explain. Florian Koerner von Gustorf is absolutely amazing in the part of Schramm. It shocks me that he has only acted in two films, this one, and also Jorgs other film Nekromantik 2. He actually is a part of other films in the behind the scenes reality, as producer. But has only acted as of this writing in 2 films, and 1 short. Floors me, because I think he is ultimately perfection. He created the part of Schramm, perfect. That is in my viewpoint one of the strong points of this film, Gustorfs performance. Added with Jorgs odd perfection in visuals, it creates something that stands out.

Audio/Video:

My Rating: 4 out of 5

This looks and sound like pure perfection. A wonderful transfer to Blu-ray. Now you have to remember this is a low budget film, and the filming reflects that reality. The movie was a low budget production, and its been many years. Overlooking this reality, the film has never looked any better. It looks almost new, fresh and just plain spot on brilliant for its age and low production filming.

My Rating: 5 out of 5

The biggest plus to this Blu-ray is the wonderful array of extras. This is jam packed with extra perfection. Cult Epic has given a vast array of supplement perfection. Something Cult Epics does is create flawless Blu-ray's, specifically when it comes to special features, and this one is no different.

Two Audio Commentaries. One with the director which is priceless. And the second one has the stars Gustorf and Monika, this one is truly a perfected brilliance in that you get to hear what it was like doing this film. For any movie buff its always great to hear from those who were apart of the movie. Both commentaries are great listens.

You also get a making of feature which is a really great watch and showcases what it took to make this film.

You also get three short films by Jorg titled, Horror Heaven, Blutige Exzesse Im Fuhrerbunker, Mein Papi.

You also get the films soundtrack. Photo Gallery, trailers of all of Jorgs horror movies.

Overall:

Schramm is a film that stays with you long after its over. I have seen this movie many times but never as beautiful as this high definition transfer to Blu-ray. Its absolutely a perfected form. A unique, twisted, gory reality, that only the brilliant, shocking, disturbingly insane, master Jorg Buttgereit is. Blu-ray Perfection.",1462060800,6,4482,4.703703703703703
