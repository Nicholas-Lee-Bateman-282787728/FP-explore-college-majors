485786,5,630252587X,"A treat of a horror film, as it shows the terror that can lurk from within even the noblest family of power and wealth.",1365379200,,119,4.0
485787,3,630252587X,"This slow-moving Universal picture has the evil Richard III, played by Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes) and with the aid of his club-footed executioner (Boris Karloff), he kills his way to the top to become king of England.

Gruesome scenes abound:  Karloff chops heads and even one scene where he has his henchmen kill two children, which I'm surprised got by the censors.  The screams are off camera, but you get the idea.

The battle scenes are pedestrian, kinda like watching a high school football game.

Karloff excels as the sadistic executioner, sharpening his axe with glee and excitement.  The torture scene of the young traitor, whom it's hard to feel sympathy for, is quite surprising.  How can a guy live through the rack, hot tongs and hung by his thumbs and still not say where the stolen treasure is buried?

Vincent Price makes an early-career appearance as a dandy and a drunkard.  Interestingly he would do the Roger Corman remake many years later.

If you're not familiar with English history, it would be easy to get lost in the intrigue.  Overall, great to watch a classic master like Karloff, disappointed in Rathbone's tepid characterization, another bit if interest for the Universal Pictures film student.

Somewhat recommended!",1254873600,5,1254,5.033980582524272
485788,4,630252587X,"This is one of Universal's few ""A"" pictures of the late 1930s. For once,they decided to spend some real time and money on a film. It shows,and the result is a lavish(for Universal)piece of enjoyable hokum. The film benefits from a literate Robert N.Lee script,solid

Roland V.Lee direction,and spirited performances from a good cast.

As expected,Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff are excellent as the villains Richard and Mord. But Barbara O'Neill and John Sutton steal the movie as Queen Elyzabeth and John Wyatt.""Tower Of London"" is not a great movie,but it's fun to watch and provides good entertainment.",1163980800,,607,5.183673469387755
485789,5,630252587X,"Laurence Olivier's Richard III is fun to watch, but his Duke of Glouchester is warped inside and out: ugly and humpbacked, strutting about. Basil Rathbone's Richard is very different from that.
True, he has a humpback too--in fact, his armor has a bump in it to allow for the hump--but he carries himself gracefully, as Rathbone always does. He's just as evil, though. Whereas Olivier has a number of asides to the audience through which we learn of his machination's purposes, Rathbone's got a little closet with the succession to the throne literally spelled out in dolls. Doll #1 is brother Edward played by Ian Hunter, who enjoys every trick Richard plays on everyone else, and condones all the murdering going on. It's clear he hasn't the imagination to realize that ultimately Richard will target dolls #4 and 5, Edward's own two sons, the famous Little Princes who vanished in the Tower of London. Doll #2 is the semi-senile usurped king Henry VI, played by Miles Mander, veteran of many a Shirley Temple and Sherlock Holmes movie. He gets dispatched at prayer by Richard's loyal executioner friend Mort, lovingly brought to us by clubfooted Boris Karloff. He pledges himself to Richard saying, ""You're more than a prince, more than a king...You're a god to me!"" Wow, how's that for hero worship? Doll #3 is the son of that usurped king, who's biggest transgression is having married the woman Richard loved. So much for him, eventually. My personal favorite is Doll #6, Richard's other brother Clarence, Vincent Price in a very early role. These two have never gotten along, so we shouldn't be surprised when a drinking bout between the brothers takes a particularly nasty turn for poor Clarence. Every time there's a victim, off the corresponding doll goes into the fireplace while the remaining dolls move up, the Richard Doll lagging behind, but making steady progress. It's a neat contrivance of the screenwriters, although Rathbone doesn't really demonstrate a need for such psychodrama.
The movie does  have a major drawback, and that's the white-hat hero whom Mort puts to every torture device imaginable, for a reason I've forgotten. This guy's not so good looking (actually looks somewhat pinched faced, like a Zachary Scott type), and his character is annoying. I suppose the filmmakers felt there had to be a good character to counterbalance all the other stuff that was going on, but frankly, the other stuff is true and a lot more interesting than this fake good guy.
""Tower of London"" is a great treat because it provides us another opportunity to see the always-dashing Basil Rathbone. What I found remarkable during this outing was the way that all these nefarious doings seemed perfectly justified the way that Basil was comporting himself. Ian Hunter has a lot more to do than I've ever seen in any other movie role he had, and I'm sorry for his usual underutilization; actually, he's pretty good. And Vincent? He brings much fun to his role as the pampered sissyboy brother who plays right into Basil's hands.
Chase up some courage and watch ""Tower of London"" to see a wonderful old movie.",1026691200,14,3116,4.912713472485769
485790,4,630252587X,"""The Tower of a London"" is an interesting horror film because it involves the same characters as Shakespeare's play ""Richard III.""  Boris Karloff plays Mord, the executioner at the Tower and the ally of Richard, Duke of Gloucester (Basil Rathbone) in his quest for the crown.  It is Mord who kills the aging King Henry VI and the young princes.  Like ""Richard III,"" the film ends with the Battle of Bosworth, but the chief difference between the two works are the Grand Guignol murders by Mord, such as when Richard and his executioner drown the Duke of Clarence (Vincent Price) in a vast butt of malmsey.  Karloff might get to do more killing in this 1939 film directed by Rowland V. Lee, but this is very much Basil Rathbone's film and his Richard does not suffer much in comparison to Olivier's celebrated performance on film.  Actually, they make a fascinating double-bill, but be sure to save ""The Tower of London"" for the second feature.",995068800,7,943,4.725609756097561
485791,5,630252587X,"you cannot compare this with any of the other universal horror movies that came around the same time.  This is not a horror movie but a historical  drama depicting the unscrupulous rise to power of Richard the III, played  in the most evil and backstabbing way by Basil Rathbone( most excellent  actor of Sherlock Holmes fame and Son of Frankenstein).  The plot and  script are so much more intricate and intelligent than the other universal  horrors, but no wonder it's not a horror movie.  Some say this is a bland  role for Karloff, but he plays an executioner that is the subserviant  friend of Richard the III, of course he is going to come across as a brute,  but what else would you expect of an executioner from the middle ages.  Vincent Price(in an early role in his career) is excellent as a snivelling  coward, that is in the way of Richards rise to power.  Overall an excellent  movie, one of Universal's best from the time period of the classic  monsters.",967248000,13,968,4.573099415204679

7827988,5,630252587X,"The Tower of London is one hour and thirty  two minutes and was released in theaters on November 17, 1939. The main story is that Richard, Duke of Gloucester is sixth in line to the throne and plots to eliminate those ahead of him. The story is closely related to the real Richard III of England. An interesting note here is that Vincent Price who plays Duke of Clarence would go on to play Richard the III in a 1962 remake with the same title. Basil Rathbone does a superb job as playing the evil Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The Tower of London gets an AA++.",1498608000,,560,4.283018867924528

7827991,4,630252587X,"I might have scored this interesting movie--beautifully acted by Vincent Price, Boris Karloff and, especially Basil Rathbone--except for one avoidable detail.  Henry Tudor is captured and subjected to the horrific tortures of the Tower of London.  He's whipped, burned with red hot irons and stretched on the rack but, heroically, he won't give up up all-important information.  Quite the contrary, he escapes, knocks guards in the head and swims like a fish.  Later he slays Richard in Single-Combat.  After surviving tortures like that, I believe Henry would have been a helpless cripple for the rest of his life.",1431907200,,615,5.23469387755102

7827994,4,630252587X,"I quite enjoyed this movie. A fictional recreation of the machinations of Richard III, casting him in the role of an arch villain in the mould of Shakespeare's Richard III.
This is both dramatic and offbeat at the same time and this is where it manages to carve its niche in the annals of cinema.
Richard, Duke of Gloucester is portrayed by Basil Rathbone as evil and scheming but not so obviously deformed as he was in Richard III (Special Edition) [DVD]. Thewrefore he can appear more charming and even dashing when he needs to be, while we see him in secret with a dolls house of wax figures representing those in the way of his line to the throne which he disposes of after having them murdered.

Boris Karloff portrays his thuggish club footed henchman Mord. And Barbara O Neil plays Richard's nemesis Queen Elizabeth Woodville.
Miles Mander comes off as an enfeebled aged and half mad Henry VI, dressed up as a pantomime king, and Ian Hunter plays a well rounded Edward IV. John Sutton plays the comical hero of the story John Wyatt-an utter fop who it comes off as satirical that he escapes and plays his role in the victory of Henry Tudor (Ralph Forbes).
Great performances by Ronald Sinclair as the boy king Edward and particularly John Herbert-Bond the boy Prince Richard of York, so beautifully done by John Herbert-Bond. So appealing and delicately beautiful- it is so difficult not to almost shed a tear watching him at play and prayer, knowing his fate. And then the brave reaction little Prince Richard actually puts up to the killers they came really stood out as moving. The scenery and props are impeccable
This was great year for cinema, with The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind and Wuthering Heights all making their debuts on screen, and this movie is a great piece of cinematic history in itself. This particular film would certainly have had special relevance in 1939 with it's theme of evil machinations and murder for the sake of power at a time when Europe was dominated by ruthless dicators like Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Franco.
It fun, offbeat, a little scary in parts, and I liked it.",1387756800,3,2119,4.665775401069519
7827995,4,630252587X,"This is yet another version of King Richard's intended rise to the English throne by eliminating all relatives in line ahead of him.  Even so, the film is well done.  Basil Rathbone is his customary villainous self, and Boris Karloff somewhat terrifying to look at as always.  Vincent Price rounds out a fine leading cast for a chilling flick.  The most memorable scene for me was where the drunken Price is drowned by Rathbone and an accomplice by being emersed in a vat of wine.  I've read that it was really coke or pepsi, which is much cheaper.

It's certainly not the world's greatest movie, but I consider it worthy of being added to anyone's private collection.",1366675200,,668,4.666666666666667
