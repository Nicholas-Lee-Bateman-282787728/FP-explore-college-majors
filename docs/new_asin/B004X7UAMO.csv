8446464,4,B004X7UAMO,What I do notv like is that the dvds are put in one socket. It is a great deal. It does not have a documentary on those days events put together in one dvd. I am not putting the item down it is good but if you want do learn about the entire  days events buy inside 9/11.,1387497600,2,270,3.6551724137931036
