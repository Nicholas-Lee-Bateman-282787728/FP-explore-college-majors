8377042,3,B002PJLV4I,"First off, I'm pleased to have the box. Moribito is an amazing series, and I'm impressed that MediaBlasters put together high quality releases for it in a less-than-robust anime market in a down economy. This box is chipboard, a vast improvement over the original box, which was more of a slipcover constructed out of thick paper (a rough equivalent might be manila folders). The new art is very attractive, echoing the awe-inspiring scenic art featured in the series. However, I was disappointed that the inside of the new box is blank. I'd hoped that the scenic artwork included inside the first box might be repeated here. That would have made this well worth the price for me. (I was able to carefully separate that inner art from the first box and glue it inside this box. It's imperfect, but it salvages the best part of the first box, and all DVDs still fit, if a bit snugly.)

I've read that the original, flimsier series box (released with vol 1) was a compromise because MediaBlasters didn't have the artwork they wanted. This is not unreasonable - Japanese companies licensing properties to Western companies must release art and extras, and they retain final approval over many aspects of the releases we see. Sometimes there are delays, sometimes extras are never provided. Rescuing this license after Geneon went under - thank you! - had to have introduced additional complications into the production process. Kudos for taking a risk by revisiting the box issue at this late date.

In the final analysis, this is pricey for an empty box, and it isn't essential. If you have the original box and you're happy with it, you're set. If you're a collector, you're probably going to want this either way (it really is very attractive and will enhance your collection). If you have the singles but itch for a box - find this on sale and it'd be a nice little purchase.",1261612800,3,1876,4.751533742331288
8377043,4,B002PJLV4I,"I for one appreciate Anime Works going the extra mile to produce this box for collectors. I have a number of anime series that DON'T have a box (""Battle Athletes,"" ""Banner of the Stars,"" ""Kurogane Communication,"" and ""Princess Nine"" all come to mind)so I PARTICULARLY appreciate this box. It's solid and servicable, holding all eight volumes nicely (meaning, all those long, innovative, plastic disc holders). I give it four stars rather than five because the art work is only so-so. Only Chagum is pictured; no Balsa or Shuga or Rarunga. Just Chagum in blue and white on one side, two blue and white landscapes on the other two sides, and on the top a FOURTH blue and white picture(not of anything that I can tell). ""Moribito"" is a great series, with a lot of fantastic artists working on it. They could have illustrated the box a little bit better. STILL, I'm glad there IS a box to buy.(Very glad!)Kudos to Anime Works for producing it.",1261180800,2,939,4.696969696969697
8377044,1,B002PJLV4I,"On what is possibly one of the worst business decisions in the anime industry this year (and believe me, Bandai had quite a few pickles), Anime Works is going for the primitive move of selling an *empty* cardboard box for the DVDs for $20...

If it came with an artbook, or a bonus DVD, or *something* extra, it might warrant a purchase.  But as it stands, if you've been purchasing the 2-packs they've been releasing, you can live without this.

The less people buy this, the bigger the realization will come to Anime Works just how retarded of a business move this was.",1260403200,5,571,4.524271844660194
