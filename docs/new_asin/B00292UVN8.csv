Charley-One-Eye (1973) is one of those odd films that come across the TV late at night. I really enjoyed it, since it was a new take on the Western. It has a black man, of recent from the Union Army, now a deserter, and his injured American Indian hostage. I didn't recognize Roy Thinnes as the Indian and Richard Roundtree as the black man. Richard Roundtree shot some Union officer and seems to be on the run. A mean-spirited Bounty Hunter is on his trail, played by Nigel Davenport (Sands of the Kalahari (1965), A Man for All Seasons (1966)).

There's a lot of oddness in the interaction between the black man and his injured American Indian hostage, who are fighting for survival in the desert. It was filmed in Almer&iacute;a Spain, the locale for so many Spaghetti Westerns in the 1960's.

It is interesting to note how the relationship develops when they are by themselves are threatened by an outsider group. The ending was very melancholy. There is also a similar film, Eagle's Wing (1979) , where Sam Waterston plays an American Indian. Grayeagle (1977) also has Alex Cord as an American Indian.

Charley-One-Eye, like Eagle's Wing (1979), were both British productions.

Charley-One-Eye is a chicken that the American Indian has taken a fancy to and perhaps is symbolic of how American Indians were treated.",1456531200,,1347,4.839130434782609

8357335,1,B00292UVN8,"I know the movement west was a lot more violent than we were taught in school.  I know there was a great deal of injustice from everyone towards everyone else.  But to me,this movie was violence for no apparent reason. It was not my cup of tea.",1397865600,,244,4.170212765957447
8357336,4,B00292UVN8,"Of the handful of blaxploitation westerns, only Charley One Eye, has not been done since.

An Indian and a deserted Soldier (africa-american) meet in a desert (probably in Mexico) and both are trying to get something like a new life. They become friends and want to start a farm or something like that. The Indian goes to a nearby town to buy some chickens. In his absence the deserted soldier is stoned to death by mexicans who seem to hate everything american. When the Indian returns he seems to fall apart.",1387411200,,510,4.604395604395604
8357337,4,B00292UVN8,"I just got the complete seasons of Roy Thinnes in ""The Invaders"" and came across this film that I can only praise. Really only 3 main charactors, the escapee (Roundtree), Indian (Thiinnes) and Bounty Hunter (Davenport). Top form acting by all three and the stage is set at the latter part in an old abandon adobe church in Mexico. Religious implications and surprising ending. Oh Charlie One-eye is a name of ""pet"" chicken adopted by Thinnes as the Indian. Cool.
The DVD is of commercial quality, but still OK.",1362268800,,510,4.741573033707865
