309453,5,6300275116,"Paul Gallico's charming little story ""Thomasina"" is turned into an equally lovely little Disney film from 1964 directed by Don Chaffey (""Greyfriars Bobby""). Veterinarian Andrew MacDhui (Patrick McGoohan) is a widower who is raising his young daughter Mary (Karen Dotrice) in Scotland in 1912. Andrew has no empathy for the townsfolk who love their pets and when Mary's beloved cat Thomasina is injured he quickly decides the animal should be killed. Mary is distraught and Andrew simply cannot understand why the logic of the situation is not clear to the girl. Mary and her friends prepare an elaborate funeral for Thomasina, at which point Lori MacGregor (Susan Hampshire) shows up. The children think she is a witch, but in truth she lives in the woods and nurses injured animals back to health using love and common sense. Lori recognizes the cat is not dead and takes it home to help it recover, during which time Thomasina goes to Cat Heaven in a marvelously fanciful sequence. Andrew has a bad reputation with the locals because he killed his daughter's cat and they start taking their pets to Lori. Andrew finally goes to see her and is not so busy being impressed by her healing skills that he fails to fall in love with her. But then Mary sees Thomasina walking outside her house and chases after her in a driving storm and ends up catching pneumonia. The doctors hold out no hope to the frantic Andrew, and Lori tells him that only he can help Mary recover using the power of love.
Lots of Disney movies have a cold-hearted adult transformed into a human being, and ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" is one of the best of this type of film, even better than ""Pollyanna. "" This is mainly because it has the virtue of a first-rate cast, from McGoohan, Hampshire and Dotrice as the three principles to Finlay Currie and Laurence Naismith standing out in the supporting cast. Elspeth March supplies the voice of Thomasina, who gets to comment on the action from time to time, and Matthew Garber, who went on with Dotrice to play the kids in ""Mary Poppins,"" also has a small role. But at the heart of this film is Paul Gallico's endearing fable. I think this is just a nice little film and I am not even a cat person.",1071964800,93,2220,4.622784810126582
309454,5,6300275116,"I saw this in the theater when I was very little. My dad teased me later when I told him it made me ""get a tear in my eye.""  It still does.
I watched it today with my 5-year-old neighbor girl.  She said she ""loved it.""  I bought the movie for my son when he was a preschooler. (He particularly loved the scenes with Jodie--the little boy--and the beautiful ""witch."")  My son 12, and his friend, 10, also watched much of the movie today.  There are plenty of scenes that made them laugh.  Some parts drag a bit (the father and the vicar had several scenes dull to a child, but important in developing the plot).
I was looking for a DVD version because I know that my video has a few scenes slightly edited.  The Disney channel version some years back was a little more complete.

I don't think it's so terrible for a child to experience a little human emotion.  Yes, the movie has some tear-jerking potential, but it has a happy ending.  The 5-year-old didn't shed a tear today.  I was just a bit less stoic.  I am sentimental about orange tabby cats & have always had at least one . . .",1060646400,9,1086,4.218446601941747

I saw  this movie as a child and never forgot it.  I've seen it several times  since and still adore this movie about a girl's love for her cat Thomasina.  (By the way, the cat is a good actor also!) Patrick McGoohan and Susan  Hampshire are the appealing adult leads.  Charming and disarming. Disney  hits another home run with this bittersweet tale of love and loss.",967766400,8,495,4.597701149425287
309457,5,6300275116,"I watched this movie with all of my children.  Now they are grown and wish to watch it with my grandchildren.  It's a wonderful story, wonderully written and so enjoyable.

309458,5,6300275116,"No one seems to get the point of this movie.  I saw it recently, and then about five years ago, plus a few times before that.  But I noticed that they used at least two noticeably different cats in this production.
No  problem.  At least no one painted one cat to look like the other!
This  movie was about grief and loss and getting on with one's life in spite of  it.  The veterinarian (Patrick McGoohan) who has been trained to be  scientific, lost his wife five years prior to the happenings in this film.  When his daughter (Karen Dotrice) believes her father responsible for the  death of her beloved Thomasina, she withdraws and almost dies of pneumonia,  save for the fact that her beloved red tabby came back from cat heaven.
I  love this movie now and I did when I was a kid, but it reveals different  dimensions to me now.  I noticed how it addresses the apparent power of  gossip to overcome good deeds.  Patrick McGoohan's character saved the life  of a blind man's guide dog when his daughter's Thomasina needed help, and  after that, a campaign of gossip against him by Mary's friends caused some  clients to turn away from his veterinary service.
  However, the movie  did present friends arguing in his favor, and he did visit with the  ""witch"" woman, Lori (played by Susan Hampshire), to begin a  healing process which ultimately led to the conclusion of the  film:

Andrew MacDhui (Patrick McGoohan0, his new missus (Susan  Hampshire), their housekeeper, Mary MacDhui (Karen Dotrice) and Thomasina  (played by herselves), seating around their dining table enjoying a family  meal together.",950486400,7,1608,4.766423357664234
309459,5,6300275116,"I remember watching this little gem on television in Concord, California around 1964!  I loved this film as a child and just got my kids the video last night for a peek after some 37 (!) years. It's every bit as charming as Disney's earlier GREYFRIAR'S BOBBY (with Donald Crisp), and, thanks to a strong cast led by Patrick McGoohan and Susan Hampshire, infinitely more enjoyable!  The film tells the story of a Scottish veterinarian Andrew MacDhui and daughter Mary, whose affection for a beautiful cat named Thomasina comes between them.  When the cat is seriously injured, Mary's father ""puts the cat to sleep"" but Thomasina is disovered by Lori MacGregor, who nurses the cat back to health.  Her love and understanding finally reunite father and daughter in the touching climax.  Although the film wasn't a huge box-office success, it was considered  one of the best foreign productions released by the Disney studio in the sixties.",943920000,51,936,4.967948717948718

Thomasina is a cat belonging to a little girl whose widowed father is the new veterinarian in a Scottish town.

This devastates his daughter who becomes disillusioned and almost catatonic in her grief. When the children are burying the cat a local ""witch"" (according to local yore) finds it and nurses it back to health. Eventually the cat 's wanderings cross the path of her former child owner's and they are reunited. Very touching story with humorous moments.

309912,5,6300275116,"Walt Disney's 1963 charmer ""Thomasina"" is still delightfully charming all these years later.  It is the story of the cat Thomasina, who lives with a family in a small Scottish village in 1912.  Thomasina is the pet of Mary MacDui, daughter of the village veterinarian, an embittered widower.  When Thomasina must be put down for a serious injury, neither Mary nor the village can forgive her father.  Fortunately, Thomasina has at least three lives, which will be spent piecing the MacDui family back together, with the help of the local witch.

""Thomasina"" is a tremendous children's movie.  The lead children are Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, who would go on to play the Banks children in ""Mary Poppins.""  Patrick McGoohan has a rare romantic role as the disillusioned Andrew MacDui, matched up against Lorie McGregor, the village witch, a believer in the healing possibilities of love and hope and well-played by the lovely Susan Hampshire.  A period Scottish village is convincingly portrayed by location shooting.  Highly recommended, especially to those with young children.",1466208000,5,1084,5.219653179190751

Colors are somewhat faded, and I suspect the ratio of the picture has been modified to fit wide screen TVs (I hate that).
Why do the studio marketing people think they know better than the film's producers???
Sound appears to be the same quality as when the movie was released (somewhat muted with little range as was typical for these Disney productions at the time.

310021,5,6300275116,"This Disney classic debuted in 1963, and despite the decades that separate its first theater showing and today, it still has the power to speak to children and adults. Thomasina is the story of a cat, and the movie addresses themes of loss, anger, and love, mixed with science, superstition, and magic. The movie raises thought provoking issues, including animal cruelty--Disney was ahead of his time here. Several orange cats play the role of Thomasina, which is obvious if you watch for it. There was good reason for this; animals, like children, were (and are) limited in the amount of time they could legally work. So, a few  Thomasinas were needed. My favorite parts of the movie are when the story is narrated from Thomasina's point of view. The scene of cat heaven is priceless.",1453507200,3,785,4.814814814814815

If and when I ever procreate, this movie will be appropriate to show my children when guests are over, so people won't report me to child service for letting them watch Kids and Requiem for a Dream, so they learn unprotected sex and drugs are bad.
This movie's moral is much more uplifting: some witches are good, love and comfort can heal and, finally, that cats are awesome.",1453075200,2,421,4.329113924050633
310098,5,6300275116,"I saw this as a child but liked it even better as an adult.  Interesting story, beautiful scenery and stage settings, good acting, well-done characters, including the little girl who mourns what she thinks is the death of orange cat Thomasina in 1912 Scotland, blaming her stern widowed vet. A ""near death"" experience by the cat stands out as especially imaginative and cinematically beautifully done especially for the 1960s.  I thought having the cat talk would be hokey but it somehow works, and many of the cat scenes, especially, are very artistic.  Excellent mostly unanimated Disney drama great for both adults and kids.",1452643200,3,627,5.067961165048544

These sorts of stories carry with them a sense of nostalgia for the people born before the Justin Bieber/ Hannah Montana generation, and have a unique charm that makes them enjoyable even after all these years. 'The Three Lives Thomasina' is one such movie, and although watching it this time around felt much shorter than before, the good storytelling is still there, and it's still fun to watch. And if you have kids of your own, it might be a good idea to give them a taste of what things were like before kids their age were walking around with iPads.

Her father is a veterinarian, however, he's been hardened by the passing away of his wife about five years prior to when the story begins.  Consequently, he takes a very pragmatic approach to his veterinary work and he sometimes doesn't exert all of the healing options that he could when treating people's pets.  Due to his perceived hardness, many of the locals begin taking their pets to the ""witch"" who lives in the glen.  The ""witch"" turns out to be a lovely knitter of sorts, who has a knack for animals via her compassion.  Lest I spoil the story, lets just say, the movie has a happy ending and it leaves one feeling very genuinely refreshed about the world.  There is only one peculiar scene in the movie where the cat dreams about the cat god.

310567,5,6300275116,"Add this to the outrageously long list of Disney films that feature a dead parent.  At this point, it's beyond a pattern; it's a mission; only orphans or kids with a single parent need apply.

Scotland, 1912, in the small town of Inveranoch, there lived a coldhearted veterinarian Andrew MacDhui (Patrick McGoohan), an atheist following the death of his wife.  He has no sympathy for useless pets, preferring instead to care for practical beasts such as farm animals and a blind man's guide dog.  He tolerates his daughter Mary's cat Thomasina for his daughter's sake (Karen Dotrice in her first of very few film roles).  When poor Thomasina is injured, MacDhui barely glances at her, claims she has tetanus, then orders her destroyed!  And then he wonders why his daughter is miffed.  A stirring funeral follows.  Fortunately, the lovely neighborhood witch (Susan Hampshire) happens by just in time to rescue the poor cat and nurse her back to health (life number two then takes place).  Sadly, the cat has amnesia and talks to herself (voiced by Elspeth March).  A vague romance between MacDhui and the witch takes place.  A circus comes to town with disastrous results.  Mary contracts pneumonia from a rainstorm and is soon on death's door.  It's very dramatic.  Happily, the late Matthew Garber brings a lot of humor to the piece.  The actors are all fabulous; the story is absorbing, it's one of my Disney favorites watched often.",1422316800,,1436,4.9004149377593365

310569,3,6300275116,"I've just watched this on a DVD from the library.

Watching The Three Lives of Thomasina, a 1963 Disney live-action movie. Not capturing the attention of my 5yo girl, but I only got it because Patrick The Prisoner McGoohan is in it.

Its set in turn of the (last) century Scotland. McGoohan is a vet in rural Scotland with his pre-pubescent daughter, her cat, and his housekeeper. The mother of the family died five years ago, turning McGoohan into a cold, prideful atheist.  The girl's cat gets tetanus, and McGoohan promises to cure her to get the girl out of surgery during an important operation, but has to put the cat down.  The girl decides that her dad is dead and stops speaking to him.

Although there is some discussion of religious faith and McGoohan's need to recapture his, this is either ignored or implied (depending on the viewer) by (SPOILER ALERT) his remarring at the end of the movie.  This sort of thing would have played better in 1963 than it will for today's viewer.  It's not too disappointing to this ""today's viewer"" because the ending for almost every movie is crappy these days, and you do get to see the female lead which I've neglected to mention in an interesting wedding dress.
Spoilers from here, forward.

The cat gives us the title of the movie and appears to be the central character, until he's killed off.  His reincarnation puts him right into the background, until he's needed to save the little girl's life, as she has given up fighting a case of pneumonia.
Anyway, a very odd movie, as it seems a lot of Disney's live action movies are.  The daughter declaring her father to be dead, and his saving his daughter's life by bringing her dead cat back to life, are - hmm - curious features.
McGoohan's priest friend plays an interesting role, and the child actors are all very good, although the girl isn't very convincing in her dying unless she's lying still.

Extras on the DVD were a nice interview with the adult female lead, and a feature on Disney's cats.  The latter starts with Disney giving a talk about cats, probably from the TV show ""The Wonderful World of Disney.  He's cut off so that we can see various animated cats from Disney music to a musical soundtrack.

Worth a look, certainly, if you're the curious type.  Picture and sounds seemed nice.  From a YouTube search, it looks like there's been a later version.",1420934400,2,2371,4.609523809523809

Meanwhile the kids and their ""funeral procession"" through town, complete with caterwauling bagpipes and a little girl in c. 1910 widow's weeds is and exercise in tragi-comedy of the first rank.

I could see my DVDs through the giant hole in the side of the box.  All three cases were damaged badly even to the point of being torn through the plastic.  One of the discs became warped due to the damage it sustained on the trip (this one).  Oh all three were still watchable, and my daughter fell in love with them.  And I wasn't about to make my 4 year old have to wait until they come back before being able to watch them again.  Not to mention the fact that there's no guarantee that the new ones I exchanged the for would arrive in any better condition.

The movie itself is endearing.  It's a must-watch for any children (old or young) who are animal lovers.  The driving message of this movie is that it's important to treat animals (and others) as well as you'd like to be treated yourself.  Or at least that's one of the messages I've always taken from it.  There's also the message that you can't judge a book by its cover (an important lesson for any child to learn).

Slight spoiler alert.

311163,4,6300275116,"THE THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA must rank as one of the most delicately moving, utterly charming and yes, most unusual films from the Disney live-action canon.  Set in Scotland circa. 1912 and based on Paul Gallico's book of the same name, it's an unforgettable film which explores a frequent theme in Disney's works - the power of transformation.

Young Mary McDhui (Karen Dotrice) lives with her widower father Andrew (Patrick McGoohan), the local veterinarian in their small Scottish village.  Mary spends her days playing with her beloved tabby-cat Thomasina (voiced with warm sincerity by Elspeth March).  It's a carefree world which comes to a crashing, tragic end when Thomasina is injured in an accident and Andrew refuses to treat her, believing her injuries to be too severe to recover from.  Mary's opinion of her father is shattered as a consequence, and as well as her cherished Thomasina, Mary begins to insist that her father, too, has died.

Thomasina, though, hovers between life and death.  In a spectacular sequence where Thomasina flies toward Cat Heaven, she instead begins her second life - in the care of the town's local ""witch"", Lori MacGregor (Susan Hampshire).  Lori lives in a secluded part of the woods and her rare touch with injured animals has earned her a reputation which rivals Andrew's in the community.  Unaware of Thomasina's past, Lori nurses the cat back to vitality.  The same cannot be said for Mary, who has fretted so much that her own health starts to decline...

It was in THE THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA that Walt Disney first paired Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, the two enchanting child actors who'd later be immortalised as the Banks children in ""Mary Poppins"".  Garber plays Mary's friend Geordie McNab in THOMASINA and he is utterly enchanting, more than holding his own in lovely scenes with Susan Hampshire and Patrick McGoohan.

The film has a few dark elements (the gypsy circus and scenes of distress involving animals).  I would be careful about screening THOMASINA for younger children, but for those aged 10 and over, I can't see any real issues.  THE THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA is one of the most unusual and enchanting films from the ""golden period"" of live-action Disney films.  Highly recommended.  The DVD includes a fairly recent interview with star Susan Hampshire which is a nice touch.",1353024000,10,2350,4.984615384615385

But Mary has three friends, all boys, who play major roles in the story, so it's not just a ""girl"" movie.  The setting in a Scottish village around the turn of the century and the scenes at Mary's father's veterinary office teach a little about geography, history and medicine. Mary's father is a widower but meets a lovely young woman who changes his life -- and Thomasina's. The romantic aspect is low-key and the kids did not even pick up on it until the very end.  There are good family values in the movie, drama, excitement, interesting characters, humor, no bad language. A good, old-fashioned movie -- highly recommended.",1341792000,2,802,4.594405594405594

311211,5,6300275116,"""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" is the story of a widower veterinarian and his small daughter as much as it is about the title character, Thomasina, a cat whose life, death, and rebirth end up being desperately important to them and their relationship with each other. Also in the mix is a beautiful, young woman living alone in the woods and labeled as a witch, along with a group of local boys who steal the show with their continuous involvement in the film's proceedings. The setting is 1912 in a small Scottish village, and Thomasina is the light of little Mary's life. Her father, however, does not take such a fond view of pets, despite being the local veterinarian. He does his job coldly and by the book, and all too often chooses euthanasia over attempting to help.  When Thomasina herself needs his help one day, the cat's resulting death sends Mary into a troubled state that continues to worsen. Of course, cats have nine lives, and little do they know that a revived Thomasina is living with local ""witch"" Lori and attempting to regain her memory. If only these troubled and lonely souls could all be brought together, but the stubborn bitterness of Mary's father could make that impossible.

Released in 1964 and directed by Don Chaffey, ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" is a beloved classic to Disney fanatics like myself. Starring Disney legends such as Patrick McGoohan (the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh) and not one, but both of ""the Mary Poppins children"", Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, the film is outstanding in terms of acting from the adults and children alike, and the animals do a decent job too. Thomasina the cat narrates the film in voice over by Elspeth March. The movie opens with a theme song that is much celebrated, but I personally found a little corny in the very beginning (I don't usually feel that way about even the corniest Disney stuff, but...); stick with it despite that though. It's high on drama, and some of the reasoning in this story of science and faith/love/God/magic/etc... finding room to coexist and cooperate with each other doesn't always make sense, but it's easy to ignore. What really holds us here are the relationships between the people involved, and of course, the animals. Thomasina looks great in this rather nice Disney DVD release. It's presented in widescreen and actually has bonus features! There is a theatrical trailer, a montage of Disney cat clips set to music and beginning with Walt's own Thomasina television introduction, and even interview with star Susan Hampshire, still looking great at her age, who played ""Mad Lori"" the sweet but alleged witch who lives in the woods caring for sick and injured animals that find their way to her.

""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" is a story that might be kind of serious compared to what some folks expect from Disney, even classic Disney, but it all depends on what you've seen so far. This one deals a lot with the subject of death, and we even get to see a very Egyptian-influenced Cat Heaven during Thomasina's first, brief encounter with the other side. There's also symbolic death, as the very young Mary declares her father dead more than once after he has disappointed her deeply. The thematic elements are advanced enough that the film carries a PG rating. However, this is still very recognizable, classic Disney live-action fair that puts one in mind of such titles as Greyfriar's Bobby, The Horse Without a Head, and the like. Even non-Disney films like The Secret of Roan Inish. Thomasina is a sweet and moving film that belongs on any Disney fan's shelf but would be a nice addition really to anyone's movie library.",1317427200,3,3645,4.800955414012739

The story is wonderful, gentle and full of anthropomorphism since Thomasina has a voice of her own. I love Lori 'the witch' and her gentle way with everything from children to animals.

The child actors, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber were used in other Disney movies - most notably Mary Poppings, and do a wonderful job of portraying their parts.

He thinks he euthanized his child's sick cat, but she is rescued by the lovely young female recluse up in the hills, whom the local children consider a witch. What becomes of the title feline, the child, the dad, and the witch and how a happy ending is created from much heartache is the story that follows. The lead children in this one, if you have not seen it already, you might recognize from the more successful ""Mary Poppins"" which was made around the same time.

Thomasina gets a ""second life"" (either no euthanasia actually done by the veterinary assistant, use of an insufficient dose, or a miracle) and is cared for by an eccentric loner woman--the ""witch"".

311274,3,6300275116,"I saw this movie when it came out in 64. I was eight at the time. I've always adored Disney films and I love cats... especially the orange tabby's which were always my favorite. I had one just like Thomasina at the time and always have throughout my life. I try to collect as many of Disney's movies as I can... except this one.

With that said, the beginning of this movie really upset me as a child and still upsets me to this day when something reminds me of it. My parents and I were caught off guard. We did not expect to see something like this on a Disney film. My parents thought I would love a movie about cats but had no idea about the disturbing content. As much as I have always adored cats, I have never been able to watch this movie a second time.

I simply could not endure watching this cat being ordered to be put to sleep by the adults at the beginning of this movie as if it was a casually disposable product instead of a living creature and beloved pet of the child. They not only order the cat to be put to sleep, they go through the actual process of putting the cat down and treating it as discarded trash. This affected me deeply at the age of 8 and still bothers me to this day when I think about this movie. The fact that the cat recovered from the botched job didn't make the horrific scene any more palatable.

A child doesn't have the luxury of placing a movie in some historic perspective. They watch a movie... literally through the eyes of a child. Things are a lot more real to them than they are to adults. But even adults are affected by movies with strong emotional scenes... so imagine what it is like for a child.

It didn't matter to me whether everything came out ok in the end or not. I just couldn't go through that ordeal again. Nor did I find any pleasure in the other mishaps the cat character was subjected to in the storyline. As a child and an adult I found this movie to be very disturbing.

I was never affected by any other movie as a child. I was not a sensitive child or adult. I was raised watching horror and space movies since I was 3. I was a fearless child and a fearless adult. Disembodied heads on monster movies didn't bother me a bit even when I was a preschooler. So for any movie to affect me in this way, it had to be profoundly upsetting about something that meant a lot to me... and my cat had been that important to me since I had been 3.

So if you have a child who is very attached to cats as I was, I strongly caution you to think twice before showing this movie to your child.

I'm sharing this because I want parents to really think about this before allowing their children to see it. Even if your child has never been upset about any prior movie, if your child is devoted to a pet cat, I really don't recommend this movie.

In some ways, the movie ""Old Yeller"" is very similarly upsetting when the boy's dog has to be shot. Why is it that these producers of childrens' shows and movies think it is necessary to show the death of the main animal character?

It may not seem like a big deal to an adult, but to a child, things like this can be horrific and cause unnecessary distress to a child who loves their pets so devotedly. 45 years later, I still remember how much this movie bothered me. You can choose to disregard my cautions if you like, but if you knew what a strong child I was and even stronger as an adult and retired engineering executive... you might think twice about this. If this movie can have such a profound effect on someone who has been fearless their entire life... think of how it might affect a sensitive child. You might never know about it. This is the first time in 45 years I have mentioned it to anyone. It's just my personal opinion but I thought someone should mention this issue.",1240444800,34,3788,4.185185185185185

I remember watching this as a child and crying over the loss of the beloved cat. To my surprise the cat came back to life and changed the little girls Father into a loving Dad and they all lived happily ever after. Disney fantasy? Perhaps, but this is one of those films that takes you back years and leaves you with a happy feeling in your stomach.

311305,5,6300275116,"When I was about 9 and first saw this on the Wonderful World of Disney I was utterly enchanted. It has hovered in my imagination for over 40 years, and now with a lovely DVD transfer I can check to see just how shameful and naive my childish infatuation was. And I can honorably report that Thomasina is almost as good as I remember!

I watched this for the first time with my nine year old grandson, and he liked it as much as I. He's a sensitive and smart young man, a bit lonely and prone to solitude, as I was. And he was as enchanted as I remember being. Susan Hampsire is beautiful, oh yes, I never loved a movie star again as I loved her. Not only gorgeous but kind, generous, sweet and utterly sure of herself. Who wouldn't want to marry her? And Patrick McGoohan, whom I loved in Scarecrow (please don't be lying again about a release this fall, please!!!), was just as good here.

But what sets this movie above the run of the mill Disney films, which were far better than nearly everything out there today, is the well-examined battle between science and religion. McGoohan, the man of science, gruff and brutally honest, revels in self-pity after the loss of his wife and has rejected God. Hampshire, the woodland sprite with an unending belief in goodness and in God, demonstrates conclusively that there are some things science cannot explain. This argument is still with us, (see ""Expelled"") with science currently managing to claim it offers a plausible explanation for everything, though those increasingly convoluted descriptions will probably eventually crumble as Ptolemy's did. But with so many good things packed into one film, great child actors, gorgeous scenery, small town prejudice and gossip, humor, charm, and love...what could be better?",1209945600,11,1767,4.771241830065359

This also cuts him off from his daughter Mary, who loves the cat with a special attachment.  Apparently, though, the shot doesn't take - Thomasina survives to live with a loving ""witch"" who nurses her back to health.

311363,4,6300275116,"My fondness for this film extends from having watched it when it first appeared in 1964.  Being all of eight years old I was quite impressed by the story and particularly by the special effects.  I am less impressed by the movie as an adult, but the movie remains cute and charming and I suspect children today will enjoy it.

Mary McDhui (played by Karen Dotrice, better known to many as Jane Banks in the movie ""Mary Poppins"") is the daughter of Andrew McDhui (played by veteran actor Patrick McGoohan), a veterinarian.  Mrs. McDhui recently passed away and her death has affected both of them.

Mr. McDhui is quite unpopular as he has put down several animals for a variety of reasons.  While his reasons are more accepted by our modern understanding of animal health and a better understanding of suffering, for the era portrayed in the film he seems more of a harsh, unfeeling and mean man rather than a healer of animals.

The movie would have been quite boring had not Mary McDhui's cat Thomasina become ill after an accident.  Mr. McDhui is attempting to help the seeing-eye dog of a man when Mary rushes in with her cat, apparently paralyzed with tetanus.  Mr. McDhui is more focused on saving the dog than on Mary's cat, and in an instant the relationship of father and daughter change significantly.

Fortunately, we have already met local ""witch"" Lori MacGregor (played by beautiful Susan Hampshire).  Lori is able to work miracles with animals not because she has the scientific skill of Mr. McDhui, but because she loves them and cares for them selflessly.  Thus, she is a polar opposite, or complement, to Mr. McDhui.  Her role in this movie will become clear shortly.

Mary and her friends have already interacted with Lori.  They have taken animals to her and she has healed them with her ""magic.""  Lori comes upon the children when they are preparing to bury Thomasina, who is actually not dead but paralyzed.  Lori frightens the children away and discovers the cat.  Lori takes the cat to her hut in the woods and tends to the cat.

Somewhere in this midst of Thomasina's paralysis is a wonderful scene with the cat in a dream-like state that I enjoy each time I see it.  Thomasina learns that she must return to the world because there is more for her to do.  But when Thomasina returns, she has lost all memory of her life with Mary.

The players are all in place and the final acts are ready to begin, but you will have to watch the movie to see how it all comes out.  Will Mary and her father reconcile?  How far do the complementary talents of Lori and Mr. McDhui extend?  Is it possible that they need each other?  What of poor Thomasina?  Just where will the pivotal character in our play end up, and will she return to life healthy?

I have said in previous reviews that when Disney got a film right, the results were fun and enjoyable.  Such is the case with this film.  Disney chose a quaint story and executed filming well.  This film marked Karen Dotrice's first appearance along with Matthew Garber's first appearance as Mary's friend Geordie.  Soon the pair would star in their greatest role as the Banks children in ""Mary Poppins.""  In this film both were fresh faces and brought a wonderful innocence to their roles.  Patrick McGoohan is a great actor who excels in all his roles, and the relationship between him and Susan Hampshire was natural fun to watch evolve.  Susan Hampshire was wonderful in her role and seemed much like a real country girl.

This Disney movie classic belongs in all family home film libraries.  Though there are a few intense moments in the movie that earn this film a PG rating, I believe this film is suitable for even the youngest members of the family with a little adult guidance and participation.

Enjoy!",1165104000,4,3774,4.611111111111111
311364,5,6300275116,"Seeing action star/spy/""hard guy"" Patrick McGoohan in a ""Disney movie"" was a novel experience, but then this didn't strike me as a typical Disney flick. For one thing, the predominant theme is death. McGoohan's wife is dead, the family cat is put to death, the daughter ""kills and buries"" her father (in her mind) - wow, pretty heavy stuff to lay on a young audience! McGoohan plays the part of a veterinarian in a small Scottish village, but when we're introduced to him, he's not exactly making friends with the locals. He immediately gets a reputation for heartlessness when he suggest to one woman that her very old dog is suffering and would be better off being put to sleep. (He throws in that he thinks she's being selfish, just in case he wasn't already cold-blooded enough!) The family crisis comes when he is in the middle of surgery on a blind man's dog. His daughter arrives with Thomasina, the family cat, who has contracted tetanus. He can't be bothered to even check her out, and instructs his assistant to put her down. Only the most stone-hearted will remain dry-eyed in the following trip to ""cat heaven"". But Thomasina's mission has only begun, and the remainder of the film is McGoohan's attempts to reconcile with his daughter and Thomasina's role in bringing them back together.

There are so many things about this movie that put it out of the ordinary. If they dropped the *very* Disney-esque opening theme song and filmed it more at an adult eye-level (it is filmed very much from the physical point of view of a child), and added a Merchant/Ivory sepia tone, this would be regarded as a great adult movie or ""Masterpiece Theater"" (think ""All Creatures Great and Small"") material. The Scottish accents (including at one scene in Gaelic) must have been incomprehensible to children's audiences when it was released, and Thomasina's ""funeral"", including bagpipes, bier, and procession through town, is not the sort of thing I'd imagine kids found cheery.

Totally unlike anything being made today, it isn't so much anachronistic as a reminder of how dumbed-down and emotionally sterile children's programming has become. It doesn't flog any specific message, but is definitely a movie that (if you can get a little one used to more frantic entertainment to sit through it) will make a deep and positive impression. Very highly recommended.",1147305600,17,2362,4.917293233082707
311365,5,6300275116,"I remember seeing ""The Three Lives of Thomasina"" as a  very young child and I never forgot it. It really touched me. Thinking  back, what I remembered the most about the movie was the sequence in which Thomasina after losing her first life goes to cat heaven and climbs the stairs to see Bast the Egyptian Cat Goddess that sees over all cats who have gone on to the other world. I, also, remembered the wonderful theme song. Here are some lines from that song:

Thomasina, what are you thinking of?

Thomasina, what makes you so highbrow?

For I do think it very odd, if you are an Egyptian God that the wee little mouse runs in and out his house each time  you blink or nod...

Recently, on the spur of the moment, I decided to see it again on DVD, and again, I fell under the movie's enchantment, however, now as an adult, I was able to fully appreciate the film; the fine acting, the chemistry between the actors, the beautiful Scottish setting, the wonderful storyline and of course, Thomasina herself. Thomasina is the narrator of the story. Her comments are humorous because we hear them from the perspective of a cat. Of course, cats being so proud, from Thomasina's point of view, she is the one who adopted the family with whom she lives [not the other way around] and the movie is ""all about her!"" It's all very humorous and sweet at the same time.

By the way, the movie, also, has a very good underlying message that was a bit ahead of its time back in 1964. All of the characters in the movie are animals rights activists who love their animals and protect them.. The movie makes a very strong humane, anti-cruelty to animals message.",1142899200,14,1647,4.4485049833887045

Perhaps in today's flashy special effects world this movie is ""boring,"" but it is full of rich characterizations, especially McGoohan's Andrew McDhui, a man hardened not only by the death of his wife, but by being forced into a profession he thought was demeaning. It is a rich psychological portrait of both the man and his daughter, whose realities are mixed after the untimely events surrounding the injury of her cat. Disney changed the modern setting of the original novel and made it a 1912 period piece, which is beautifully set. Karen Dotrice is wonderful as the troubled Mary, and Disney regulars Vincent Winter, Denis Gilmore (both were also in the television movie The Horse Without a Head), and Matthew Garber memorable and often amusing as her friends.

The dvd has two featurettes and is letterboxed. Recommended without reservation.",1119657600,9,621,5.038834951456311
311391,5,6300275116,"I have just seen this movie for the first time with my young

children and loved it.  I hadn't seen this film as a child and

would have driven my mum and dad crazy for a cat if I had.

We have a family cat and my daughter is mad about cats and

picked this out because of her obsession....she loved the movie.

She now wants to dress up our cat like Thomasina.....great movie

and a lovely meaning behind the story too.",1118966400,5,420,4.048780487804878
311392,5,6300275116,"as a young girl, i loved this movie, now my kids watch it. parts made me cry - i was a sensitive kid, and i loved animals, especially cats (still do.) when the dad wouldn't listen, and Thomasina was in trouble, ohhh man, sniff.. well, i won't give it away. but, as a kid - my bigest question was - why only 3 lives? don't cats have 9 lives? i asked my mom this, and she said, the movie would be too long if they did all 9 lives. humm, ok, well, i bought that for awhile. now i want the honest truth - hummm Disney? the kids in the movie are the ""mary poppins kids"" cute. great movie. get it.",1115164800,7,591,3.8925619834710745
311393,4,6300275116,"I really can't say it better than the other reviewers regarding the story of Thomasina. The DVD is excellent quality and the picture and sound are clear and sharp and couldn't be better. It is letterbox format. The Scottish scenery and sets are beautiful. The DVD includes:

* ""Disney's Beautiful Witch""
* ""Disney's Purrfect Cat Stars""
* Trailer

""The Disney's Purrfect Cat Stars"" featurette has Walt Disney talking about the story, movie, and includes a montage sequence with cats from the Disney movies. The ""Disney's Beautiful Witch"" feature is an interview with Susan Hampshire talking about her part in the movie. There is a trailer from when the movie was originally released. This is a great Disney classic and it is a movie the whole family can enjoy.",1113004800,10,759,4.921875
311394,5,6300275116,"This classic Disney movie brought me to tears the first time I saw it on the Disney Channel, when I was 7 years old. I wanted a cat soo bad after this movie!!! So, a year laterI got one, (allwhite), I loved her soo much and I named her Thomasina!!! This movie is soo important to me now, because MY cat Thomasina died a couple of years ago at age 17. But she lived a happy and content life as my pride and joy of life. I'll never have a cat like her again, and I'll never love a movie as much as I loved this one!",1102636800,5,513,3.803738317757009

Wonderful story of a girl,a cat,a good 'witch' and a single dad.
Classic themes of faith,hope,charity and redemption along side modern ones of single parenthood,witchcraft and the afterlife.
Integral to any childhood lessons on morbidity and

311396,5,6300275116,"40 years later, Disney's charming and whimsical THREE LIVES OF THOMASINA is a must for families to sit down and enjoy together.  Grab some Kleenex though---it has some sad moments.  Aside from the joy of the wonderful story itself, savor in the marvelous ways these children get along and bond, how they are there for each other.  How the people in the village are all friends and share their joys and griefs.  Delight in the performances of Patrick McGoohan (The Prisoner) and Susan Hampshire (Forsyte Saga); enjoy the children played with gusto and wonder by Karen Dotrice, Vincent Winter and Matthew Garber.  THOMASINA is a fable for all ages and in today's world of so-called children's movies (Spy Kid, etc.), an oasis in a desert of mediocrity.",1096934400,7,750,4.874015748031496

311398,5,6300275116,"Finally.  Here's a great Disney film that the studio has wisely chosen to release on DVD in a widescreen version.  The letterboxing is correctly mild (1.66:1), and is SO WELCOME after, sadly, Disney has released so many of its classics from this era in crappy full-screen cropped versions.  Thanks, Disney, for this DVD.  Please keep releasing films in their correct aspect ratios...",1090627200,16,383,5.129032258064516
