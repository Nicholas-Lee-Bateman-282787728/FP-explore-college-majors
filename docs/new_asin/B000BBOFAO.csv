2411239,1,B000BBOFAO,"This movie is why we see very few black actors that win oscars. Compare this movie to those done by Samuel L Jackson, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington. These movies might be hits to the ghetto fabulous, but real entertainment they are far from being. It's just another excuse to show young black men what people portray them as being and doing, and in this movie, it's gang bangers and drug dealers.",1183507200,7,404,4.625
2411240,5,B000BBOFAO,"I had seen this movie getting bootlegged in Downtown Brooklyn for weeks before I actually rented it. While I wasn't sure what to expect, (the box cover made the movie look cheap) I knew it was hitting a nerve on the street. Word of mouth had that movie selling thousands of bootleg copies. When I watched it I found out why. While it is very violent, it also has heart. I'm not surprised Lion's Gate released this gem in the rough, I just wish they hadn't insulted it with such a cheesy title.  I have a feeling this is going to be one of those movies, we're watching years from now. When I returned the movie to the video store I bought my own copy (legal, of course). I hope Ghetto Dawg 3 is as good as 2.",1132617600,2,707,4.1231884057971016
2411241,5,B000BBOFAO,"One element of this movie is the sad spectacle of vicious dogs fighting in a pit while people gamble on the outcome, hence the title -- but it can also refer to the people themselves, living in a world of guns and crime, fighting for their lives.  It's no place for an inexperienced teenager like Donte (Daniel Outlaw) but he finds himself caught up in it when his older brother, a soldier for a gang boss named Big Daddy, is killed in a gun battle.  Donte swears revenge, but when the time comes he finds himself unprepared to carry out the act, almost resulting in his own death.  So he begins to hang out with one of his late brother's associates, Jojo (Paris Campbell), who can be deceptively easygoing one moment and a cold-blooded killer the next.  Since killing is the main duty Jojo performs while working for Big Daddy, Donte tags along in the hope of acquiring this skill so that he can apply it against the man responsible for his brother's death.  In the process he comes dangerously close to losing his soul, and becoming just another ""dawg"" struggling to survive in the pits.

This is a very fine movie in all respects.  There are good performances from the entire cast, an intelligent script, and highly-capable direction from the Crook brothers.  There are bursts of violence, but it is realistic and non-operatic (no slow-motion, quick cuts, etc.).  Everyone involved clearly wanted to use the low budget to make a thoughtful, engaging film rather than a simple exploitation flick, and they succeeded.  The final scenes are tense and suspenseful.  I found the entire movie to be a very satisfying viewing experience that went well beyond my expectations.",1128470400,10,1671,4.767361111111111

8084691,1,B000BBOFAO,"While ordering ""The Lost Dogs: Michael Vick's Dogs and Their Tale of Rescue and Redemption""  this horrible item is displayed as ""related"" to the book mentioned above. Only a dumb computer can assume a relation between these topics. While ""The Lost Dogs"" shows how to rescue poor deranged, misused dogs, confiscated from a criminal named Michael Vick, the latter item tries to glorify dogs with baring their teeth, snarling, being misused as weapons or ""sport objects"".
I am so disappointed to find this kind of ware at Amazon.
""Ghetto Dawg"" is exactly, what nobody really needs and wants. Except some criminal owners who should be banned from owning any animal.
Sorry, I cannot rate it zero stars - what would be the correct rating.
Sorry for my bad English, I am from Germany. I have two rescued dogs at my home (Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier).",1285200000,2,863,4.870748299319728
8084692,4,B000BBOFAO,"Why would anyone want to compare this movie or the actors to the likes of Denzel Washignton ( won and oscar for a drug dealing crooked cop) Samuel Jackson ( crackhead in Jungle Fever) or any or famous black actor for that matter. This was a low budget film which for all its worth wasn't a bad movie. The story line was well scripted and the actors actually acted well above the salary which Im assuming wasn't much. This is not the first and it will not be the last of the "" Ghetto Film"" genre. I applaud anyone who has the drive to make a movie against the odds and have people purchase your artistic product. I also applaud the actors in the movie who took an opportunity and made an impression ( You see all the people writing reviews...so I wasn't the only one who saw it..lol) I recommend Ghetto Dawgs 2 strictly for what it is.....Entertaining for the price.",1217289600,3,865,4.345679012345679
8084693,2,B000BBOFAO,"The producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Not only are they giving pit bulls a bad name, but they are portraying black people just as racist people think they really are. This movie is dispicable and should not even have been made. This is just another reason why black movies suck.",1200096000,5,301,4.592592592592593

8084695,1,B000BBOFAO,"Capitalizing on the brutality, violence, and abuse of the dog fighting world for financial gain is ghastly.  Selling this material supports and perpetuates this horrible industry and sends the wrong message about our society.  Until Amazon stops distributing this and other dog and cockfighting materials, I cannot in good conscience give them my business, and I will urge friends and family to do the same.",1187740800,15,407,5.246153846153846
