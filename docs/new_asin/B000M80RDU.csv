8167031,5,B000M80RDU,"I was fortunate to see this production live in Chicago, over 30 years ago, and it stirs fond memories.  Headed by Mirella Freni's radiant Tatiana, it is a beautiful staging, very well sung and acted by all the principals.  Wolfgang Brendl made a specialty of the title role; Peter Dvorsky is an excellent Lenski, and of course Nicolai Ghiaurov (Freni's real-life husband as well, who coached her into assuming Russian roles) is a definitive Prince Gremin.  If Bruno Bartoletti is not the ideal conductor, he is at least competent.  This performance very much requires issuance on DVD.  the best alternatives on DVD are the Kirov Opera on Kultur (with Sergei Leiferkus as Onegin and Temirkanov conducting) and the lavish traditional Bolshoi production conducted by Mark Ermler.",1428019200,,776,5.126984126984127
8167032,2,B000M80RDU,"I'm writing here to protest Amazon's sloppy listing. I have been hunting for a DVD copy or VHS copy of the Chicago Lyric Opera production of Eugene Onegin with Mirella Freni. Alas, they have lumped several different versions of this opera together as if they all had the same cast, although it is obvious these are all different performances. What is even worse is that for each different production, they have repeated the same comments. Hey, Amazon---WAKE UP please and fix this. Each entry of Eugene Onegin is listed as being performed by Freni, Dvorsky, etc., although it should be obvious the casts are entirely different.
