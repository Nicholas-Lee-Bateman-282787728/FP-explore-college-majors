The service was really good, and I would recommend it and wouldn't hesitate to order another one by Scott Cole.",1462838400,,255,4.622222222222222

Discover Tai Chi: Back Care with Scott Cole is a user-friendly program and so much easier to use that any other I have tried to use.  You can use the whole program to learn, then do the movements to soothing music and at the end Scott is by the ocean putting all the moved together.  Wonderful!!",1367452800,,355,4.253731343283582
