5929576,5,B00EO2I6L0,"""..I think for my generation, and the generation right before me, Drew Struzan was the movies."" - Guillermo Del Toro.
Drew: The Man Behind the Poster is an in depth look at both the man and his work, told through incredibly candid interviews with not just Struzan himself, but his colleagues, the filmmakers with and for whom he worked, and the fans of his work (who in many cases also appeared on his posters.)  The film moves quickly through Struzan's early life and career where he worked on album covers and launches into his film work.
While the film highlights the more recognizable work on the big properties, lingering on things like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, the Muppet movies, and Back to the Future films, there are plenty of honorable mentions and glimpses of this other poster art.
The documentary continues to heap praise on Struzan as it moves through his work, and while it touches on the some of the negatives in his career, like a partner who ripped him or the studio demands and Photoshop, it is does not go so far as to be an expose or an indictment.  Instead of dwelling too long on that negativity, we get a celebration of the man and his work and, told with the exuberance his fandom.  The filmmakers are so effervescent it almost challenges Drew's own quiet and humble nature.  In fact, when Struzan appears at Comic Con it really does overwhelm him.  Ultimately, there's no surprising reveals or deep revelations, but as it stands it really is a fan's peek inside the world of an iconic artist.
The DVD itself is pretty basic, including a trailer, comic con panel and some additional interviews.  A blu-ray edition would have been a nice option, if only to better showcase the art.
I would suggest one of Struzan's books to accompany the film, as the 16:9 film ratio just doesn't do the art justice, nor do the short peaks at the work as they appear on screen.  Make sure you can flip through and linger on each image and take it all in to really appreciate what the artist manages to commit to paper.",1384992000,2,2026,4.564738292011019
5929577,5,B00EO2I6L0,"Saw this down in Hollywood a few weeks ago and would recommend it to anyone interested in art and /or movies. Drew Struzan is the great poster artist of the last forty years. His story is fascinating and the work is nicely demonstrated. I will be ordering this right now. If you want a more indepth discussion of the film, here is a link: [...]",1384473600,3,344,4.3076923076923075
5929588,5,B00EO2I6L0,"Loved how the documentary started right off with showing Drew painting a movie poster. Only lasted for a minute or two, but that right there was almost worth the cost of the DVD for me!! But I enjoyed discovering little tidbits of his life story as well as the fact that he's so naive and humble about his talent and influence on his fans. The interviews with his celebrity fans were great because I could easily relate to their fan worship of Drew but in several cases, more poetically than I ever could. This disc will get plenty of repeat viewings over the years from me.",1436313600,,574,4.4245283018867925

5929594,3,B00EO2I6L0,"Outstanding artist. Was nice documentary to watch in some ways. It seems more tribute to his work in the industry with all his friends, supporters and actors he drew acting as talking heads and chatting about him. A little history of his education and life and career, but I really would have liked a much deeper understanding of his work and how he worked from him rather than or at least in addition to than a bunch of folks yapping about how great his work is.",1415923200,,463,4.395348837209302

5929596,5,B00EO2I6L0,"This documentary now available on DVD is a wonderful testament to the indestructibility of the human spirit and the value of marching to your own drummer.

Legendary movie poster-artist Drew Struzan was an unwanted baby, an unwanted child and an unwanted student. He says he didn't miss being happy because he didn't know what happiness was supposed to feel like. He was only content when he was able to draw. He drew on toilet paper, old flyers, and discarded newspapers. He enrolled in art school and was thrown out for failure to pay his tuition. He simply went around to the rear, entered the back door and went on with his studies.

His faltering career was shared by a young woman who flirtatiously lobbed a ping-pong ball at him and never looked back. Decades later, they are still married and he now knows what happiness feels like.

Some of the interviews are with:
  * Dylan Struzan - his wife couldn't give him grocery money, he'd buy paint!
  * Christian Struzan - his son is proud of his father's enormous legacy.
  * George Lucas - who has a major collection of his work, including the ""Star Wars"" series.
  * Harrison Ford - says Drew inspired him to be as good as his posters. ""Indiana Jones"" was one of the iconic results.
  * Steven Spielberg - insists Drew's posters make the story better. Just look at ""E.T.""
  * Michael J. Fox - watched Drew's original poster become a triptych as the franchise grew.
  * Guillermo del Toro - loves Drew's ability to simplify. He did the poster overnight for the remake of ""The Thing.""
  * Frank Darabont - used Drew for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile.""
  * Steve Guttenberg - says ""Police Academy"" owes its sequels to Drew.
  * Thomas Jane - Drew tried to teach him how to draw for a movie role but failed miserably.
  * Joanna Cassidy - was surprised by the quality of his ""Blade Runner"" posters.
  * Alice Cooper - used Drew for an award winning album cover.
  * Thousands of adoring fans at the 2012 Comic-Con in San Diego.

You will be stunned to see how many of his posters are classics.",1412640000,,2063,4.5271739130434785
5929597,5,B00EO2I6L0,Great documentary of a well known illustrator and how he works. Also it's a good example on what it takes to be a successful illustrator. It takes hard work and perseverance which Drew speaks of in the film. Also a good film to show students entering the illustration business. Highly recommended.,1410134400,,297,4.8431372549019605
5929608,5,B00EO2I6L0,Great to put a human face behind the great posters.,1406937600,,51,4.2
5929609,3,B00EO2I6L0,Enjoyable but a little amateurish. The idea and the story behind this renowned poster artist is good but it tends to stretch out a bit and the filming and narrative are a little amateurish. It's enjoyable - especially if you like movie posters - but it doesn't ever quite lift.,1405728000,,277,4.56
5929610,5,B00EO2I6L0,Great look back at the amazing career of Drew Struzan. I can only hope that he does the occasional poster so we can see his work in poster cases around the world again!,1395878400,,168,4.121212121212121

5929613,5,B00EO2I6L0,"An amazing insight to the art industry and what this man had to go through to become the best of the best. A rare glimpse of a great sensitive mind behind these great works of art. Reviews online will tell you this movie is average in it's content, in relation to the general public. But to a visual artist like myself, this is gold. So if you're an artist, you will definitely want to check it out.",1394323200,,399,4.194805194805195
5929614,3,B00EO2I6L0,I enjoyed the film about Drew's poster art.  He is a fantastic artist with bold concepts and application of his poster art.  I'm sorry the studios seem to have gone to computer artists rather than use artists such a Drew.,1394064000,,221,4.5
5929615,5,B00EO2I6L0,"This is such a great documentary it shows an amazing warm talent, this artist has inspired me since I was a child, after the first five minutes of watching it I had to purchase this immediately, the many works drew has created has never ceased to amaze, finally seeing the master behind this amazing art who has made me want to be the artist I am reminded me again how he has been one of my heroes since I was a child, he is one of the last sincere hard working talents that exists, when I was a child I would try to replicate movie posters like Star Wars, Back to the Future, or even Police Academy to be a better portrait artist, to name a few movies I grew up with and loved, being an artist myself, there is no other feeling like the canvas and oils, thank you Drew for sharing that the importance of this art form",1394064000,,818,4.11875

5929620,1,B00EO2I6L0,I watched the first 40 minutes of this and thought this should really be a coffee table book not a film and then I found there is a coffee table book.  The film shows posters and talks about the details but you can't really look at them too much without a big TV and pause.  This just makes more sense as a book that you can spend 10 min getting lost in the intricate bits.,1389830400,,373,3.96
5929621,5,B00EO2I6L0,One great documentary about the man who created some of the most iconic movie posters in the industry- From harry potter to back to the future and star wars- its a wonderful flick that every inspiring artist should watch. I also loved how the movie touched on the differences with Drew's drawings and painting techniques with the modern day era of Photoshop and how his (Drew's) style of creating has become a dying art.,1389139200,,420,4.6891891891891895

He's covered some of the greatest films of all time. When George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Guillermo Del Toro, and Frank Darabont need a memorable piece of art created to convey their stories to audiences BEFORE they've seen the films Drew is the incredible artist they call.

If you're a movie fan or a fan of great contemporary American commercial artwork then buy this DVD and get to know the quiet somewhat introverted talent who's images have been engrained in our memories for decades.",1387756800,,627,4.915094339622642

His story as told by interviews with Mr. Struzan, his wife, George Lucas, Micheal J. Fox, Steven Spielberg,  and others.
It was a very interesting story, like a extended 60 Minutes segment.  Many pieces of his art work are featured.
Mr. Struzan is a man who earned the respect of Hollywood through dedication and hard work.",1385337600,,420,4.819444444444445

8607265,5,B00EO2I6L0,"My bro let me borrow his copy and I'm about 20 minutes in and can safely give this 5 stars already. I've always wondered who this guy was after growing up with movies he painted covers for. For someone with such talent he has no ounce of arrogance. He took jobs at the last minute, sometimes even when the studio failed to give him any real time to plan which is ridiculous, and yet, he nailed the posters in a matter of days anyway. He did The Thing in 2 days!  Surprised that a lot of the concepts were off the top of his head, not always Spielberg or Lucas giving input. The Temple Of Doom poster for example which is my favorite was all Drew's concoction. Since I was young I always loved staring at that cover, the details and lighting. As a kid I assumed these were just pictures of the actors, this guy painted them and that's how real they look. The guy is a legend and seems to live a very happy life with his wife while being retired now. Neat to see he started out with cd covers then was quickly lured away to begin his movie poster career. Even if you don't like art but like movies you'll enjoy this doc.",1470441600,,1118,4.152073732718894

8607267,5,B00EO2I6L0,"A wonderful and interesting documentary. Some documentaries can be a bit boring but this one kept my attention throughout, and I was actually sorry when it ended. I was touched by the fact that this gifted artist is also a very humble man. Well worth watching again.",1447545600,,266,4.680851063829787
8607268,5,B00EO2I6L0,"I was very interested in hearing about his background and challenges he faced as an illustrator
This video did a nice job of revealing much of that story.",1447286400,,154,4.535714285714286
8607269,5,B00EO2I6L0,"If you are a pop culture fan, you'll want to see this.  Truly an iconic artist whose work contributed to the whole being more than the sum of the parts.",1445040000,,152,4.066666666666666
8607270,5,B00EO2I6L0,"Yes, there are a lot of people sitting there giving praises to his work, but why not? He's EARNED it! It was cool to hear him talk about getting started, and what he went through. (spoilers?) And how rough he had it trying to get through school, and being a self employed artist, for the most part. It was great to hear what other people see/feel/experience when looking at his art, traditional art posters in general, and his effect on the industry.
It was even more amazing to see Drew's reaction upon seeing that he had fans. Actual fans. How numerous they were and how appreciated he was.
I don't usually get emotional, but being an artist myself, it was really comforting to see that an artist can get beyond ""starvation mode"". You just have to work at it. There's light at the end of the tunnel. It's all going to be okay.
This was some great insight on experience, some brief and fleeting talk about techniques... This was really helpful, and inspirational, and makes me want to stop using the digital medium for a little while.
Thank you Drew. For everything.
Will be watching again. :)",1440892800,2,1094,4.558375634517766
