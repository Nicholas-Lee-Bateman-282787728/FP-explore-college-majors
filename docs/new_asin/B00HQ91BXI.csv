8634203,1,B00HQ91BXI,"I bought the single DVD of 'My Stepmother is an Alien' several years ago and have never been happy with it because it is full screen. Don't get me wrong...I love the movie, just not the cut-off picture. Before now I had not seen a widescreen version of it available and so I jumped at the opportunity to see it in its full size and glory. Well, the DVD arrived today and I immediately dropped it into my player with great expectations only to have them crushed. This is NOT a 1.85 widescreen version of the movie. Mill Creek simply zoomed the full screen version and made it fill a 16:9 screen. I know because my TV has that function and I was able to compare this flick with my other one. They are exactly the same. By stretching the movie they introduced more grain and less clarity. Just what I needed*!* I can't over-stress how angry I am with Mill Creek for this blatant deception and how utterly impossible it is that I will EVER buy anything from them again. I haven't watched the second movie yet and probably won't...I'm just too mad. Do yourself a favor and pass on this chop-job.",1427328000,4,1090,4.374384236453202
