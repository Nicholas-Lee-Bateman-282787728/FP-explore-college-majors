1049545,3,630557605X,"A not terribly interesting adaptation of Shakepseare's wonderful play, _The Taming of the Shrew_.  The soundtrack, however, is intersting in the way it uses a series of cover songs, including a final cover of Cheap  Trick's ""I Want You to Want Me.""",938908800,,248,4.880952380952381
1049546,5,630557605X,"This movie is truly beautiful. I have seen it 7 times and I fall in love with it every time. Drew Barrymore is one of the greatest actresses and this is her finest movie. It is about an awkward, shy copy editor, Josie  Geller,  who basically wants more out of life. Her first assignment is to  go back to high school (undercover) to see what teens are like today. One  problem is that Josie has a horrific high school experience (she was a  geek) and it was always hard for her to fit in. And when she goes back to  high school, she finds that things are still the same. Although, she falls  in love with her dreamy English teacher and obviously, being a former geek,  was never kissed. I don't want to reveal the whole movie, just that trust  me, go see it. It is so wonderful!=)",935452800,,780,4.216216216216216
1049547,5,630557605X,This is the wonderful actress Drew Barrymore's second flower films project her first project was she helped produce some of Ever After..Getting to Never Been Kissed it was her best film yet it really shows about being  yourself and popularity isn't everything and getting made fun of because  silly reasons and how far you will go to be not the ugly duckling but the  Swan i wish i could give it 20 30 40 50 stars i loved Drew's performance im  her #1 fan and i hope i get to meet her someday Drew keep up the good work  Love ya,935020800,,528,4.188118811881188

1049681,3,630557605X,"This is a formula movie that you know what is to happen as it has many times before. It does serve the purpose of spending time. The acting is good and the scenes are adequate.

The story of an undercover reporter, Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) enters a high school playing a kid again and has the chance to do it all over.

Will it be different this time as she has the knowledge of hindsight?

Will there be conflicts of interest? If so, how do you deal with them?

If you are into go back to high school movies, then you need to watch ""Full Moon High"" (1981) with Ed McMahon.",1501891200,,578,4.18018018018018

1049813,5,630557605X,"Such a good high school flick but with a shift in perspective, as Drew plays a shy, socially awkward and nerdy teenager who blooms into a somewhat shy but more socially adept young woman who revisits the American high school atmosphere, struggles, overcomes, and ultimately finds romance too. I thought her personality really shined through, as well as her kindness. The scene where she stands up for her one real friend is very touching, and makes you think about how superficial high school, and society is in general.",1486684800,3,520,4.920454545454546

1050618,4,630557605X,"This is probably one of Drew Barrymores best Romantic Comedies. Unbeknownst to teacher Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), Josie (Drew) is an undercover reporter sent back to high school to get the dirt on how different or how similar are todays high school students.  Alas, Josies first time experience in high school was an epic flop socially and her second seems headed for disaster too until her brother Rob (David Arquette) lends a helping hand by sowing the high school with plenty of Josie social capital. Josie becomes a favourite of Mr Coulsons. Theres a genuine feeling of respect and love developing between the two leads, but because hes her teacher, he cant even think about it, but deep down he is.  Mr Coulson isn't enamoured by her youth and beauty, but her wit, charm and intelligence. Unfortunately as he begins to feel this way towards Josie and you begin to get the impression that Josies feelings may be mutual, her newspaper bosses decide to turn the  article into an expose on teachers who fall for their underage students, even though Josie isnt. Josie doesnt want to do the story and wants to reveal the truth to him before its too late, but a series of unfortunate events bring everything to a head before Josie can speak frankly to Sam. By the time he learns the truth, he feels he cant trust her.
The title to this review, a quote from the move, not only sums up Josies experiences in high school, wanting to be accepted, but also sums up what we as humans want most: to be loved.",1451433600,,1502,4.597014925373134

1050991,4,630557605X,"Released in 1999, Never Been Kissed is a cross between a romantic comedy and high school drama. Drew Barrymore stars as Josie Gellar, a geeky copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times who lands her first journalistic gig masquerading as a 17 year-old at a local high school. With the help of her hip brother (David Arquette) Josie hopes to be a popular kid rather than a persecuted outcast, as she was when she was in school. Complications arise when Josie hits it off with one of her teachers (Michael Vartan).

The movie is filled with peripheral stars or up-and-coming stars: John C. Reilly plays her boss at the Sun-Times and Molly Shannon her best friend while Leelee Sobieski,  Jeremy Jordan, Marley Shelton, Jessica Alba, Jordan Ladd and James Franco play teens at the school. Marley Shelton, by the way, wins the Best Babe award.

The first time I saw the film I was a little disappointed, but I saw it again last night and enjoyed it more. I must not have been in the mood for a romcom the first time I viewed it. while Im not big on romcoms, I do enjoy high school or college dramedies now and then and Never Been Kissed delivers the goods. Its not great, but its certainly good enough. The cast is great and its fun seeing all the up-and-comers. It features quality subtexts as well.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area and Chicago.

Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) is a successful copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times. Shy, controlled, and very disciplined, she is fantastic at her job, but painfully out of touch with the world. She would love to be a reporter, but her boss, Gus (John C. Reilly) doesn't feel she has what it takes to get out there and get the story. Fate intervenes, however, when one day during a business meeting, the big boss Rigfort (Garry Marshall) decides he wants an undercover story done - an expose' on high school students. Without warning, he points to Josie and tells her to enroll in high school.

At first, Josie is completely thrilled at being given her first shot as a reporter, despite the concerns of her boss and her office friend, Anita (Molly Shannon). She heads to the Tiki Shack, a luau-themed packing/mailbox store, to talk her brother Rob (David Arquette) into trading cars with her. Rob then reminds her what she has seemingly forgotten - that high school was a nightmare experience where she was picked on relentlessly, nicknamed ""Josie Gross-ey"", and became the victim of many cruel jokes.

Despite these revelations, Josie bravely moves forward, working on hair styles, make-up, and finding more up-to-date clothing to wear. Despite missteps along the way, she finds a friend named Aldys (Leelee Sobieski) and becomes a member of The Denominators, a Calculus Club. She also discovers an amazing attraction between herself and her English Teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan).

Josie is 25, a virgin, and has never had a relationship. She's never even had a first kiss. She attempts to connect with the ""cool kids"" in school but fails miserably. Unfortunately, Rigfort tells her that her job depends on it and in desperation, she talks to her brother Rob, since he was always one of the cool kids when they were in school.

Rob takes it upon himself to enroll in school himself and by the first afternoon, is part of the popular crowd again. Through well-placed comments, he helps Josie to find her way among them, as well. When she receives a hidden camera to wear, her feeds become the office entertainment at work, as everyone experiences high school vicariously through her. It doesn't take long before her boss, noticing the attraction going on between her and her teacher, orders her to do a story on him, focusing on inappropriate student/teacher relationships. It is up to Josie to figure out what to do to save her teacher, save her job, and find her way to true love.

I have adored this movie for a long time. Frankly, it is one of my ""feel-good"" movies and one of those that I simply have to watch every so often or I start to have withdrawals. Drew Barrymore is her usual adorable self. Michael Vartan is altogether crush-worthy as her teacher. And most of the cast is quite likable. I really enjoy Jeremy Jordan as Guy Perkins, the most popular guy in school. Although he has his ""jerk"" moments when he refers to Aldys as ""Alpo"", for the most part he is cute, intelligent, self-assured, and seems to effortlessly navigate his way through the the high school experience without taking it too seriously. At one point, he decides to start a new word - ""Rufus"" - (a positive adjective) - and I rather like it.

I think many of us can relate to Josie's character, at least to a point. High school was not much fun for a lot of us, and the thought of going back and going through all that again could be really scary. Watching Josie grow and find herself along the way is a pretty wonderful thing. And the ending, quite honestly, makes my heart swell and makes this mushy editor get all teary-eyed every time I see it. If you haven't had the chance to enjoy this lovely movie yet, I hope you do, very soon. In my humble opinion, ""Never Been Kissed"" is definitely Rufus!",1413158400,,3865,4.658357771260997

1051296,2,630557605X,"Apart from Gertie in ET, I don't enjoy any of Drew Barrymore's performances.  She must be very intelligent despite her outfits so she must be doing that on purpose but I find Charlie's Angels to be truly awful and this movie is unwatchable as well.

It's not her appearance, it's not her style (Ashley Judd liked to stick flowers behind her ears as well), it's that her movies seem to be the same dishonest faux -twee, look at me, cozy safe little stories about female empowment - a little bit like Jennifer Garner in 13 Going On 30 and Jennifer Garner and her films are also supposedly pro-girl.

They can't both be consistently almost plastic.

So there must be a purpose for Drew Barrymore's oeuvre including why she keeps being employed whereas someone like Winona Ryder is rarely seen.

A lot of people praised Jane Pratt's Sassy magazine but that thing still went out of business (justly).

This movie is like this - it's the opposite of Buffy the Vampire Slayer high school where all the students were usually played by adults.  It's a schtick of aw gee, Drew Barrymore.

But Maybe she's got a good hard piercing delivery behind all of that.  I really enjoyed the inappropriate for my age - Life Unexpected - it was just a very weird show - that was less self-regarding aren't I cute in this outfit while being unshallow about my teen years - and more total emotional intensity especially by Shiri Appleby.

1051354,5,630557605X,"A delightful 1999 Drew movie. She produced it (Flower Films) and starred in it. As a brilliant college graduate and copy editor for the Chicago Sun-Times, Drew (Josie Geller) is sent on her first assignment as a reporter. Her new adventure at age twenty five, takes her as an undercover investigator back to her old high school to find out what goes on and what has changed. Actually, just like nearly ten years before, Drew has her hands full just trying to fit in. Navigating the social lessons are still formidable. Cliques, mean people, show off's, and rejection, give Drew a little trouble passing herself off as seventeen and as an english major in college, she quickly gets boos and hisses in literature class. Through some tense moments, new friends, twists of fate and the curse of falling in love with her English teacher, Drew finds herself as the Prom Queen at school and nearly fired at work. However with a clever plot, love, and Drew's world class acting, the chaos has a tearfully funny and happy ending.
All in all, it is a middle-of-road movie. Setting, photography, cast and script about three stars. Drew Barrymore, the usual five stars. It has been said that when the director calls for action, drew just begins speaking, and the crew wonders if she heard the call. She did. Drews devastating childhood, two decades of experience, five generations of Barrymore talent, her personal charisma and irresistible charm, determined will to survive and reach stardom is the more compelling of these two stories.  Drew can carry any movie and it is always a joy to see her work.",1409961600,,1591,4.806569343065694

Anyone who was nerdy and less than stellar in high school popularity could find something to appreciate in Never Been Kissed. Drew Barrymore beautifully portrays Josie Geller, a brilliant, yet past-haunted, copy editor. I often watch the movie even when it comes on cable--and even though living vicariously through Josie Geller's high school experiences is painful. Yes, being older now, I do see how it's a little predictable, but it made a mark on me. I became a copy editor because of this movie. I chuckle, though, that Josie's voiceover toward the end uses a dangling modifier: ""A geek to the core, most of my childhood years were spent doing extra homework I requested from the teacher.""

1051461,1,630557605X,"There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. First and most serious, with all the scandals involving teacher-student relationships, we're expected to sympathize with this teacher's penchant for his student because we're in on the secret that she isn't really 17. Well, he doesn't know that and doesn't seem to work too hard on resisting the draw he has toward her. Nor does her dancing like a hooker at a bar arouse any protective concern for his student, just an amused and tolerant shrug. Drew Barrymore's character really offers nothing likely to attract her teacher, either, other than an engagement with the subject matter he teaches that his other students lack but which is countered by her overly extreme awkwardness in every other aspect of life. She clearly didn't learn much from her first high school experience about how not to come off as a complete idiot. In addition, the actual relationship between her and her teacher never gets to the point where an expectation that he should show up in front of a packed football stadium to give her her first kiss seems reasonable. There are the requisite high school bullies to put in their place, but while the younger girl elicits sympathy, it's hard not to think that the more mature woman should be handling herself much better the second time around. All in all, there is too much to overlook to make this believable or fun.",1403222400,5,1389,4.767634854771784

Drew Barrymore is such a good actor that she can play an adult playing a teenager with all the quirks and lack of self confidence that went with it...for most of us!  Barrymore is ""Josie"", a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times who get assigned to go back to high school undercover to write a story.  She blends in very well.  She was an awkward dweeb in those days, and all those old feelings come bubbling back to the surface much, much too easily.  Barrymore charmingly loses all her sense of timing and rhythm to play this part which makes the dance scene hilarious!

1051649,3,630557605X,"I recently watched Never Been Kissed (DVD) at a family friend's home. While I had heard people talk about this movie before, I had never watched it myself. Which is surprising because I love movies set in high school. I think that Drew Barrymore came off as absolutely adorable and the 1980's soundtrack for this late 1990's movie was rather cute. Not to mention, I was already giggling from the very start!

This movie is about a former high school nerd, now working as a reporter, whose job is to go back to high school and pose as a high school student. She crushes on a student, develops feelings for a teacher, and the goal of becoming popular is added to her job. Will she succeed? Well you must watch to discover. Or you know, you can just guess the predictable outcome. It really failed to grasp any of the same feelings from other high school movies around the time. For example, after watching Clueless, I did not feel clueless at the end. I really felt as if the main character learned a valuable lesson, matured, and was an all around positive role model for young girls. When I was watching this movie, I failed to feel the same way. The girl finds out that high school sucks just as much as she remembered and ends up romancing with her teacher. Which came off as very underdeveloped and dry romance, in my opinion.

I feel like this movie, while enjoyable and cute, does not add anything new or exciting to the high school genre. It really follows the paint by numbers formula and, like I said before, struggled to win over my heart in the romances. I am really surprised this movie has somewhat of a cult following and feel like it is mostly because of Drew Barrymore's bubbly and likeable performance.

Should you watch this? If you must. But do not go out of your way to see it. I have seen much better high school movies that have come before and after this. This is nothing bad but nothing special or enlightening.",1376265600,2,1934,4.4576271186440675

She also failed to develop a cover story and was forced to make one up on the spot when one of her teachers told her to tell the class something about herself. She did a HORRIBLE job of improvising a cover story and the whole movie is just one awkward, humiliating situation after another.

1051959,4,630557605X,"Ah, a feel good movie. A 28 or so year old Josie works as a copy editor but dreams of being a journalist and having her own story. She is plain, with mousey hair, pimpled skin, and simple, plain clothes. For the most part, people tend to overlook her, if they pay her any attention at all. So becoming a journalist in the competitive field is unlikely, unless she does something extraordinary to prove she's able to handle the job.

Because she looks so young, and due to other circumstances, she is finally assigned a journalist job: Go back to high school and infiltrate on the inside to get her story.

Josie realizes she can reinvent herself now, to be anyone and act any way she wants, because she's not a high school student anymore. She starts off a bid nerdy, but soon comes into her own, when one of the more popular 'boys' in school takes an interest in her. Her all-star baseball playing brother gets into the act when he comes to the school under pretense to help her out as well.

In the process of writing and researching her column for the undercover investigation, she wears a wire and is monitored by those with whom she works. When one of the younger, more attractive and popular teachers acts in what can be misconstrued as an inappropriate way with Josie--who is supposed to be a child--the boss tells Josie that they have to expose the teacher.

Josie has now betrayed everyone's trust and the truth, as it has a way of doing, finally comes out to everyone... in the end, Josie apologizes to the teacher, but he still feels betrayed, so she writes to him in the paper and sets up an extraordinary meeting with him in the public eye, revealing she has never had a real, grown up kiss... and that she wants him to be her first. Will he show up? That's the ultimate ending to the show, but you'll have to watch it to find out.

There are a few laugh out loud moments in the show, if you're one who has ever had an insecure moment back in high school. There are some smile moments too, and the ending works for the story. It's a good movie for a fun and cute entertainment experience and I'd say it's mostly okay for kids to watch too. There's a little language, but no sexual content or violence or other scenes that would be uncomfortable for kids and parents to watch together.",1320624000,11,2297,4.395294117647059

With the exception of Drew's repetitive ""Let me tell you something"" (3 times in her speach at the prom-the film editor should have caught this since Drew's character prides herself throughout the move on perfect speach.), the film was very well done.

1052040,3,630557605X,"I love Drew Barrymore, but there is a reason that she has Never Been Kissed, and it is because of her horrible acting. The Executive Producer should have fired her on the spot, but wait a minute. She WAS the executive producer. That explains a lot. This is the first film in Drew's producer resume, and her acting is OK in parts, but she only partially redeems herself, because when she is bad, she is very bad.

She is playing a copy editor at Chicago Sun Times who has been given a chance to be a reporter. Her assignment: go back to High School posing as a student and dig up a scandal. Her return to High School triggers all kinds of painful flash backs, because she was a major geek. They all called her Josie Grossie. As an uptight copy editor, always correcting everyone's grammar, she is OK. When she goes back to High School, she is really bad. The script was not her BFF, either:

---------------
Guy Perkins: Hi, I'm Guy.
Josie Geller: Yes, you are a guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Hey, that rhymes! Yikes. Bikes!
Guy Perkins: Are you in special-ed? I mean, are you?
Kristin Davis: A Geek?
Gibby Zerefski: You totally just said that out load.
==========================================

David Arquette plays her brother. He was popular in High School, where he was a talented baseball player, but since he never made it to the Big Leagues, his High School years were the highlight of his life, and it was downhill fast from there. He goes back for another shot, and also to help her infiltrate the cool kids. Once Josie gets to drop the geek act, then she does much better. But still, that is not enough to save this movie from the terrible story. It just doesn't work, and it doesn't allow her to really get back at the guy who asked her to the prom only to drive by in the limo and egg her. That, or something similar, would have made the catharsis complete.

You'd think that after so many movies have been done in this whole High School genre, what works and what don't work would be obvious. Yet, the writers decided unwisely to reinvent the wheel, and that is why this vehicle never goes anywhere. They didn't plan to fail, they just failed to plan.

On the bright side, Molly Shannon as Anita, and John C. Reilly as Gus, were both funny, as usual. Shannon especially. Sean Whalen shows the makings of a good character actor, as Merkin, Josie's assistant. Leelee Sobieski as Aldys, a girl from the outcast math club, The Denominators, who befriends Josie early on, is someone to watch for. A couple of small parts were played by actors who went on to bigger and better things, so don't miss James Franco and Jessica Alba.

At the prom there are slow dances to ""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want"" (Written by Johnny Marr and Steven Patrick Morrissey and performed by The Smiths) and ""Don't Worry Baby"" (Written by Brian Wilson and Roger Christian and performed by The Beach Boys). ""Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want"" was also in the prom scene in Pretty in Pink.

Bottom line, Never Been Kissed is a weak addition to the High School movie genre, but nevertheless you still might enjoy it if you like Drew Barrymore enough to put up with her less than stellar performance.

1052041,4,630557605X,"To me, Drew Barrymore's best films are when she was a child star.  Her films' ""Firerstarter"" and ""Cat's Eye"" remain some of my favorites although I loved most all films that came out in the early to mid eighties.

Drew was a bit too young to be part of the ""brat pack"" actors and actresses of the eighties (Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Demi Moore, Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald, Mathew Broderick, etc.)  although Drew started in ""Altered States"" and ""E.T.: The Extra-terrestrial""  before any of those ""brat pack"" stars were ever filmed or even recognized.

But, what really makes this film stand out for me is the absolutely wonderful young actress Leelee Sobieski.  Her role here as an aggressively self-defending unpopular nerd girl was such a great role for her.  I really loved how she played her character here.  In many cases, she really upstaged Drew Barrymore as a performance demanding attention.  Even Jessica Alba (who had a mean role here) couldn't steal anyone's fire in this film.

I thought this film was fun.  Perhaps some people didn't care for it because it does remain pretty innocent for entertainment.  I know today's teens enjoy themes more representative of bad taste and offensiveness.",1238889600,,1234,4.965853658536585

1052043,5,630557605X,"This review is from my wife Sarah: Never Been Kissed is one of my all time favorites. Drew Barrymore is absolutely believable and lovable as an intelligent but seriously geeky 25 year old writer who goes undercover as a high school student. In the course of looking for her story she must break into the ""popular"" click, but that's tough because inside she's still the same geek that she always was. In this process she finds her healing and dignity. Her under-acheiving brother steps in to help her, and he also finds his own second chance at life.

She also falls for a teacher who sees her as an off-limits high school student. The entire story is told in a totally amusing and engaging way. It's a story many people will relate to, and though it's a great ""chick flick"", I believe guys will love it as well. It's just a great story, with a lot of wit, humor, great acting and a strong script. From start to finish it's completely engaging.

I've got to reveal that I've probably seen this movie over 20 times. I do think this is a movie worth buying, and I highly recommend it to everyone.",1224979200,2,1093,4.432835820895522

Predictably, she discovers more about herself than she does about any story and along the way she finds love in a most unexpected place.  This movie isn't too deep or that thought provoking, but it is a modern day 'fairy tale' with a happy ending that will leave you feeling good.

She plays Josie Gellar a painfully shy editor for the Chicago Sun Times, and through a comedy of errors, ends up being appointed as an undercover reporter at a local high school.  This film switches back and forth between the past and present as we see Josie try to fit in with the students.  She was shy and tortured by her peers the first time around which left her with some pretty deep scars.

This movie gives a horrible message to any young person watching. the main character (Drew Barrymore, who is not sexy enough or talented enough to have a movie) is a reporter who sacrifices her career for popularity.

The message is as horrible as the acting. She prefers to be a victim of the judgment of teenagers and keep a fantasy view of romance (never happens in real life) rather than maintain her professionalism or advance her life. any mature adult watching the movie should see the immaturity of the main character, her failure to move past her primitive teenage instincts. It seems to praise women who are too emotional for professional positions in lucrative careers and are too stupid to move past high school. While there is no problem with a movie about a girl who goes back to high school, elevating her for doing so is appalling and shows that the character has de-matured and fallen into a world of fantasy.

It was painful for me to watch this as it was not comedic or effective in sparking emotion for me to recommend to anyone. This is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen.",1204588800,4,1195,4.605633802816901

All I know is that its a great inviting type of film that deals with real issues. Drew Barrymore is great in this. She is awkward and cute and funny all at the same time. Its a good role for her. I loved all the High School flashback sequences. It has such a great storyline and for a comedy based high school, its actually really good. There are quite a few unrealistic things pertaining to this movie, mostly with some of the students, some wardrobe issues, and other minor tidbits, but as a whole, it works and its very cute and touching.",1202947200,,772,4.222972972972973

A touching performance from the always-wonderful Drew Barrymore guarantees that this DVD belongs in your collection.

If you've never seen this film before, I urge you to ignore any negative reviews and buy it. It gets better every time I watch it! The story has a ring of truth to it because it seems to draw heavily from a non-fiction book written in the 60's by reporter, Lyn Tornabene. She went back to high school to expose the realities of adolescent existence. Her book, I Passed As A Teenager, has the same touching effect on me. High school was Hell for most of us. The good news is that one way or another, we're going to get out!

Barrymore knows how to carry a romantic comedy, this film also has elements of dramatic overtones. The best thing about the movie is the soundtrack, some great pop and rock tunes like Jimmy Eat World, The Cardigans, R.E.M., and classics from The Smiths and The Beach Boys. If Barrymore hadn't been cast as Josie, I don't think this film would have worked, she's also producer of this film. Never Been Kissed is an honest and sometimes painful look at high school and finding your way back to reality. Defintely a must-see, it's not just a chick-flick.",1192838400,2,646,4.881818181818182

1052107,5,630557605X,"For those of us who went through the ""Josie Grossie"" stage, this movie is a welcome comedy, a sort of Revenge of the Nerds meets The Princess Diaries.  Josie Gellar (Drew Barrymore), a 25-year-old copy editor/reporter, has never quite gotten over her traumatic high school years, replete with bad hair days and insensitive classmates.  Understandably, she has mixed emotions when her boss, noticing how young she looks, decides Josie can go undercover and give ""Sun"" readers the latest scoop on high school life.  So back to Fast Times at Ridgemont High...  Not only is Josie anxious about this assignment, but she's worried about her personal life.  At 25, Josie has never even kissed a guy (or rather, been kissed by a guy)--but she doesn't just want to kiss any guy, but someone really special.

While researching this high school expose, Josie has painful flashbacks as she witnesses how kids treat each other. (That a woman as pretty as Drew Barrymore would be willing to look as bad as she possibly can is sheer dedication to her art!) Through her brother's influence on the popular kids (he earns coolness points as a local baseball phenomenon), Josie gets inducted to the alpha crowd and unwittingly slights her ""uncool"" (second-time around) high school friends. Josie enjoys her English class and surprises her teacher, uber-handsome Sam Coulson, with her love for words and knowledge on the subject. Meanwhile, the Sun eavesdrops on Josie and her high school adventures.

Sam (Michael Vartan), is noplussed by Josie's maturity yet apparent youth.  When he learns that Josie is an undercover reporter, he becomes hurt and angry.  Josie tries to apologize through the very tabloid that brought on her trouble--and readers anxiously await to see if Sam will meet Josie in a baseball stadium to deliver her first kiss before the appointed time.

(Let me interject my two cents here: Michael Vartan is hot...he has my ideal body type, sigh...I was writhing with jealousy during the kissing scene!)

This movie is hilarious and well-written.  It's been accused of being formulaic, but so what?  It has a good message and is very funny.

My friends and I never tire of watching this movie, and the expression, ""Josie Grossie"" has taken on a life of its own. When we show pictures from our childhood to each other, we often qualify them as, ""This picture was taken from my Josie Grossie years.""  (You know, glasses, braces, bad hair, the works...) Or, even in our grown-up years, we'll tell each other if we're feeling particularly Josie Grossie on a given day.",1175904000,4,2563,4.941724941724941
1052155,5,630557605X,The storyline is simple and fun.  That's the way I like them.  It also helps to be a huge fan of Drew Barrymore.,1167868800,,112,3.8260869565217392
1052156,1,630557605X,"This is a completely ridiculous and unrealistic movie.  Josie, at 25, is still not over the fact that she was unpopular in high school, and whines for the entire movie.  It's unclear why any one likes her, espesially her teacher.  It's also hard to get over the fact that the teacher, beleiving that she is in high school, makes no attempt to hide his feelings.  The final scenes tie nothing together and the issue of her betrail is not delt with.  Never Been Kissed isn't good as a silly unbeleivable comedy; it's both painful to watch and devoid of any redeaming qualities in its content.",1166227200,12,590,4.580952380952381
1052157,3,630557605X,"How would high school be different if you were given the opportunity to go back and relive those times, but with all the wisdom, knowledge, and experience you have acquired since then? Would you do things differently or would you end up doing similar things that you did the first time around? I'm not really sure what I would do, but if I was given the opportunity to relive the high school years I don't know if I would even take it. However, that idea forms the foundation for the movie NEVER BEEN KISSED.

Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) is an intelligent, beautiful, and hardworking woman who works at the Chicago Sun-Times. At twenty-five, she's also the youngest copy editor on staff. Josie likes her job, but what she really wants to do is be a reporter. She finally gets her opportunity when the owner of the paper gives her an assignment of going undercover as a high school student to find out what it's like to be a high school student in today's society. I mean, everybody forgets high school after they graduate so nobody has any idea what its like (ha, ha, ha). So, Josie enrolls and finds herself doing the exact same things she did when she was originally in school. Apparently people used to call her Josie ""Grossie"" back then and she still hasn't developed enough self-esteem to overcome those feelings of inadequacy. Josie finds herself developing an attraction to a handsome hunk of a teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), but she can't do anything about her feelings without blowing her cover and getting Mr. Coulson in trouble. Of course, since Josie's job is also on the line because unless she starts hanging out where all the ""dirt"" is, aka the cheerleaders, preps, and jocks, she's going to get fired. Oh, and to top it all off, Josie has never been kissed.

As a member of one of the only truly royal acting families in the U.S., Drew Barrymore has made quite a career for herself and has acting in around sixty different movies. Barrymore is one of those people who could do anything she wants and that's just what she did. She started a production company to develop original scripts written outside the system and the first project she chose to develop was NEVER BEEN KISSED. Perhaps Drew hasn't been getting many job offers or was just bored, but whatever the case she also cast herself in the lead role. Let's see USC is the top film school in the country, not much outside influence going to be happening there. The first movie chosen to develop is a romantic comedy. But get this, the lead is going to star Drew Barrymore as a woman who has never been kissed! How unbelievable can you get!

I like Drew Barrymore. I really do. I first had a crush on her when I was a kid and saw her in E.T. But, Drew Barrymore as a girl who has never been kissed is as unrealistic and unbelievable as the moon being made of cheese.

Of course, that's one of the more realistic things about this movie. The teacher that Josie likes makes advances at her. That has lawsuit written all over it. Everyone pretends its okay after Josie's true identity is real, but it's not okay. It's slightly deranged, immoral, and illegal. But then again the high school Josie attends is more of a college than a high school.

Most of the acting in the film is dry and uninspiring. Barrymore is cute as usual, but cute doesn't carry a film unless you're a child actor. The only performance of any note is that of David Arquette who plays Josie's older brother, Robert, who was a popular kid in high school and never could let go of those moments that were the best of his life.

Overall, NEVER BEEN KISSED is a formula romantic comedy that falls on its face. It's barely worth watching if you're a fan of Barrymore's. Other than that, pre-teen and teenage girls will probably adore it.",1158710400,,3784,4.541055718475073

1052159,1,630557605X,"There's nothing clever or subtle about this movie, there's no energy or chemistry, and it ain't even funny. Many movies can get away with formulas and cliches, but not this one.

There are two stories: one about cool kids and nerds, the other a love story. The cool kids are beautiful, dumb, and cruel, the nerds are unattractive, brainy, and kind. Josie - Drew Barrymore - is a nerd who was constantly abused by the cool kids when she was in high school. It seems that the cool kids had nothing better to do than to torture and humiliate Josie. Now that Josie is a 25-year-old newspaper copy editor - and still a virgin nerd - she is given her first journalistic assignment: to attend high school as an undercover student and produce a sensational story that will sell lots of papers. The only problem is that Josie is still a nerd, and she's no better at infiltrating the cool cabal than before. But that all begins to change when Josie eats a marijuana brownie. Deep inside the nerdish girl is a wild and crazy party girl desperate to get out, and it feels great when she does. And everyone likes the party girl better.

Now the love story. There is one person who likes both the nerdy Josie and the wild and cool Josie: her 30-year-old Shakespeare teacher, who, by the way, is not a nerd but a cool teacher. I mean, he really likes her, and it shows. It almost seems that he's stalking her, because after school he's always where she is. But since the feelings are mutual, Josie doesn't mind. At the Senior Prom, while slow-dancing with Josie, the teacher is about to tell her how he feels, until she interrupts him because he is being recorded by the newspaper. In other words, Josie stops him from being caught committing a crime. Does Josie see any red flags that this teacher she loves is making moves on what he thinks is an underage high school student? No. Not only does she ignore the red flags, she makes a huge public display of their falling in love at the end of the movie, and everyone is ecstatic. Hey, what's more romantic than a cool high school teacher falling in love with a student?

If in describing the absurdities of this movie I have made it sound less boring than it is, I'm sorry. It's really not worth your time.",1153267200,9,2242,4.436893203883495

Themes like time travel fantasies to overcome regrets; if I only knew then what I think I know now, were in the much more superficially upbeat _Never Been Kissed_.

1052234,4,630557605X,"I saw this movie when it first came out on DVD, and fell in love with it. So I decided to buy it on DVD.

First the review of the movie (5/5): 25 year old Josie Geller works for the Chicago Sun Times and is appointed as an undercover reporter to do a story on the kids in high school. Having been an outcast and tormented endlessly in school when she was young, she now gets a second chance to finally fit in, and if possible, live her dream of becoming popular, find the right guy, and get a good story all at the same time.

I thought this movie was great. I mean, most people in high school never really fit in, and watching this movie is like relating to a fantasy that would never become true for most of us. Anyway, Drew Barrymore acted superb as Josie and the chemistry between her and Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan) was well done. The rest of the cast like Molly Shannon, David Arquette and John Reilly provided good humor for this movie.

Now coming to the review of this DVD: Ok, since this is kind of an old movie, and the DVD was probably released when the concept of DVDs first came out, but that doesn't mean that they should include ONLY a theatrical trailer in it. Forget special features, there isn't even a cast and crew information section in this DVD. At least they could have added that. THAT is why I removed a star and gave this a 4-star rating.

Anyway, whether this DVD is packed with features or not, this is a fun movie to watch if you just want to see a light hearted romantic comedy. If you liked movies like ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" you will definitely like this.",1123372800,4,1607,4.259016393442623

Kinda stupid and drew did a poor acting job in the film about a reporter undercover at a local high school. And what is up with the way she looked? Drew use to be so cute when she was younger (Bad Girls, Boys on the side) She just looked very unattractive in this movie especially at the end with no make up on when she waited for him to kiss her, her eyes looked all big like cow eyes very far apart, and her nose looked like michael jackson's, and she was a little overweight in the movie too. Maybe I'm being harsh. She was pretty in 50 first dates and charlie's angels. I guess she is just the type to need alot of make up. She was hot years ago!!",1113436800,2,736,3.946308724832215
1052237,5,630557605X,"Most of this Romantic Comedy takes place at the Chicago Sun-Times, and a local Highschool.  Josie Gelder (Drew Barrymore) is a 25- year old copy editor at the Chicago Sun-times.  She longs to become a reporter, but her boss Gus (John C. Riley) does not think that she has what it takes.  Josie is finally given the chance by Gus's boss to do an undercover piece to find out about kids in highschool today.  With her and Gus's jobs on the line, Josie enters the school, as a seventeen - years - old student, searching for something to write about.  Soon Gus realizes that Josie is over her head, and with the help of a hidden camera helps her find a piece to write about.  After reviewing the tape he notices that Josie's English teacher is starting to have feelings for her, so he decides that she is to write a piece on the relationships between the teacher and the student, whether she wants to or not.

  I give this film five stars.  The reason for that is because  I thought it was a funny movie that kept me entertained the whole time, without my mind wondering to something else.

1052300,5,630557605X,"I am a huge Drew Barrymore fan and I have been following her work forever I've probably seen every movie she's done and so far I like all the work she's done she's a very beautiful strong woman and talented honest actress.
  The main star Drew Barrymore (Charlie's angels 1 & 2, the wedding singer, etc., etc.) plays Josie Geller, a 25-year-old who graduated school at the top of her class. She's never kissed a guy or even had a real boyfriend but she is the youngest copy editor at the Chicago Sun Times and wants to be a serious reporter. So she was very excited when she is assigned her very first job as a reporter to go back to high school as a regular teenager and find out about teenagers today. Then she remembers her own painful high school experience and it seems impossible that she will be able to fit in and get her story.
 When she first starts going back to high school it looks like Josie's second experience of high school will be another nightmare until her brother enrolls himself in school also undercover as Josie's ex-boyfriend and quote 'good friend' unquote. He fits right in with the cool kids and makes his sister seem wild and cool to everyone. That's when things really get interesting at school and suddenly Josie is a huge part of the group of cruel but ridiculously attractive and popular teens but soon realizes for the first time in her life that maybe this isn't a group she wants to be a part of after all.
David Arquette (from the scream movies) plays Josie's 23-year-old brother Rob a popular fun-loving easygoing guy but is not as success-driven (he still lives with his parents, never went to college, works at what is called the ""tiki post"") as his sister. In my opinion David brings a fun and carefree vibe to every scene he's in. Let me just say I found what Rob says in the movie as advice to Josie ""all you need is the right person to think your cool and your in everyone else will be too scared to question"" very true in my experience because just like everyone else, even popular people fear rejection. Although I admit some things in the movie are just a cliche and not really how high school is.
There is so many characters that are great cause the whole cast is great but this would be too long to tell about them all you'll just have to check the movie out to see and appreciate them all.
Constantly Teased by the cool kids, pressured by her boss and a deadline for a great story, Smitten and distracted by her English teacher, and haunted by her past, it's an interesting and often hilarious and touching to watch Josie's journey to realizing if she wants others to accept her, she'll have to accept herself first and not being ashamed of who you really are is cool in itself.
Despite what the editoral review said, although drew is beautiful and popular in real life she has the ability to sink in to every character and cliche she is given in her movies, She's almost played about every cliche and I know a girl in my old school that I went to school with Elementry, Junior High, and High School and in each one the whole school knew her because she was totally clumsy akward annoying and geeky and was harrassed by almost the entire school and as far as I know had no friends and certianly had no boyfriends. Drew plays that part so well it's not even funny. And like someone else said the movie teaches you that no matter what symbol status you had in school you still can have a bright and happy future if you believe in what you can do and choose to not let your past and mistakes control you. The girl in my school I mentioned attends a great college and is engaged. So my advice is to those that attend school don't under-estimate the ""akward geeks"" in your school cause one day they could grow out of it and have a great future and maybe even become famous one day. So you may want to be nice cause some day you might be kicking yourself in the head for treating them like crap.
Bottom line, this movie is funny, romantic, touching, and supported and saved by a terrific conviencing and talented cast. I highly recommend it.",1082332800,3,4085,4.386543535620053

1052306,5,630557605X,"I bought this movie without having seen it. I just like Drew Barrymore as an actress so I thought it couldn't be that bad. And it definitely wasn't! I laughed, cried, cringed, just every possible emotion.
Josie is a copy editor who's first assignment as a reporter is to write about teenagers, which is why she has to go back to high school. Now high school is not a good memory for her b/c she was always made fun of in high school...she is dreading it, but tries to change (i.e. put on makeup, new clothes, new car) in order to fit in. Plan goes awry though because those things are just NOT popular anymore. Oops...
She is once again the odd girl out until her cool, younger brother Rob (Arquette) also enlists in the school and makes her popular almost overnight. Like he says, ""You just need one person to think you're cool and you're in. The others will be too scared to say anything.""
There is also a thing developing between her and her English teacher, Sam, him finding her brilliant and unique, her finding him attractive and kind. But he holds back because he still thinks that she's a student of 17 years.
Prom is included, where Josie's true identity is revealed and Sam storms off feeling betrayed and made a fool of. Josie, now a confident woman because she has realized that it is what's in your heart that matters, writes about her experience as her article for the newspaper, in the end, asking Sam for a chance to make things right.
The ending was very sad, I was sobbing my eyes out. Drew gives a wonderful performance on the baseball mound. No words were needed as she waited for Sam to appear and give her her first kiss...all you needed to do was look into her eyes, welling up with tears threatening to spill over. The emotion was all there in those eyes and they make you feel for her so much, that you can't help but feel her despair. This one's a keeper.",1068336000,,1881,4.392550143266476

Some of the jokes are really nice and make you laugh, but sometimes ""Never Been Kissed"" drifts off into dumb slapstick comedy.
All in all, this movie is worth watching. You won't want to buy it on DVD, but youll have a funny time.

David Arquette is quite funny as her younger, cooler brother.

But if you are looking for a nice movie to relax watching on a Saturday night, this is perfect. Drew plays Josie, a very clumsy woman who spent her whole life being a perfectionist and her high school years asking her teachers for extra homework. When she's offered her first report of her career, she is overwhelmed and very excited. But it's going to be tough. And yes, so we've all heard of the nerdy girl going back to school and becoming popular, but this movie takes that and does alot more with it. Drew's performance for one is amazing, and so is Leelee Sobieski's, who plays Josie's friend at the high school. I won't explain all about the movie, but I will say that this is a different, modern day fairytale about really finding out who you are.

The reason I knocked this rating down to 3 stars, was it really dragged just before the prom, when she was undercover. A whole lot could be sliced. Before and after that was great. The ending was very predictable, although it's sad at the same time - I didn't think it was going to happen! Get off the pitch, so they can play their game guys!
I didn't understand the whole marijuna cake bit at first, but it was very surreal to watch it! It's like watching Renee Zellweger sing drunkenly in Bridget Jones - most of this film must have been a total embarrassment for Drew to film!

Watching her in the movie playing a girl who was always trying to desperately to fit in, in high school but never could and always was the butt of someone's joke. All grown up Josie is now successful and working as a reporter, she is given an assignment by her boss wonderfully played by Gary Marshall to do a story undercover, the catch: she is going back to high school. Hoping to redeem herself, Josie tries to be cool and fit in with everyone, but instead looks like a fool. She soon meets a nice guy, who happens to be her english teacher and soon their friendship turns into more than a friendship. The rest of the story is pretty much Hollywood formula romance, but it is still an enjoyable film. There are also some amazing supporting performances by John C. Reilly and Molly Shannon as Josie's coworkers Gus and Anita, David Arquette as Josie's brother Rob, Jessica Alba and Michael Vartan as Josie's teacher and love interest. Never Been Kissed is a great movie, and is something I can relate to, growing up in elementary and junior high I was never the popular one, but then I realized now that it doesn't matter if you're popular or what people think about you. As long as you have confidence in yourself, it doesn't matter what other people think. This movie does not only have good laughs, but a great message as well.

Drew Barrymore is Josey a Copy Editor for the Chicago Sun Times that gets the assignment to pose undercover as a student and unveil the truth about teens today. Thinking that this was the ultimate assignment, she's so happy that she has to tell her brother Rob (David Arquette). Rob then reminds her what high school was like for her and then she realizes that she may have made a mistake. It's a total fluff cutesy romantic comedy of going from geek to sheik.
I wasn't all too thrilled with this because I saw the humor in it, but it really didn't make me laugh out loud or anything. As far as comedy goes, I thought it was fair. I'll give it that the physical comedy in this movie was really good. In myopinion, I thought that it was a better romantic comedy if anything ekse because it was really cute and fluffy with Josey's love interests.

1052447,3,630557605X,"The premiss of this romantic comedy/teen escapist fare is, what would it be like to go back to high school a few years later?  Would you with your worldly wisdom triumph over the brutal social structure that so onerously held you down, and would you join the socialites at the prom with the cutest guy?  Inquiring minds want to know.
First of all, we want to know how Drew Barrymore, the sweet, trashy siren of the first Poison Ivy (1992), and the way accomplished actress and sex symbol of sixty (count 'em) other flicks, could be cast as a ""Josie Grossie"" nerd of a clumsy, socially inept wallflower?  Make-up, yes.  Good editing of course.  And some fine acting by Barrymore, an actor not afraid to look her worst, and indeed she does look her worst here.  Alas.  The clinging gowns, the ratty hair, the make-up emphasizing her worst features (a nose looking a little on the Miss Piggy side, shot from slightly below) and down-playing her best, her pretty eyes, her sensual mouth.  Instead of looking pleasingly plump, Drew comes off as plainly fat.  But this is all the better for the metamorphosis to come.
I didn't stick around for that, secure in the knowledge that it was inevitable (but you might want to see for yourself).  Incidentally, Drew was the executive producer, which shows she has guts as well as some loose change for such ventures.
Second question: does Drew sell out her chess and math club friends to join the cheerleaders?  And if so, how does Director Raja Gosnell pull that off without making the darling of E.T. (1982) look like a shallow social-climber?
I'm not sure that was pulled off as well as it might have been, again not sticking around for the finale, but you might want to check it out.  Also worth checking out (if you're a girl) is Michael Vartan who does a fine job playing Drew's sympathetic teacher.
Bottom line: Connoisseurs of Drew will find much worth while here, as will 15-year-old home alones on a Saturday night plotting their eventual triumph, but experienced movie-goers will probably want to watch reruns of Seinfeld or Just Shoot Me.  Or better yet, if you're looking for a girl-nerd flick that really is funny and painfully sad and true-to-life in a totally original way, I highly recommend Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995) which really is brilliant.",1028764800,2,2304,4.73
1052448,4,630557605X,"While the plot is not airtight, Never Been Kissed succeeds because it does not try to be anything other than what it is--a quirky, fun romantic comedy.  I adore Drew Barrymore, and she is wonderful in this movie, allowing us to see her as a pitiful, geeky teenager, a plain and mousy young lady, and ultimately as a beautiful, self-confident woman.  Josie Geller (Barrymore) is a copy editor at a Chicago newspaper who desperately wants to be a reporter.  The eccentric head of the newspaper selects her to go back to high school undercover and produce a story about today's teenaged youths.  Excitement turns to horror as Josie flashes back to her torturous high school days as ""Josie Grossie,"" but she puts all of her effort into fitting in with her new classmates. She eventually ""transitions"" from geek-dom to join the cool group and develops a real connection with her English teacher Mr. Coulson (Michael Vartan from TV's ""Alias"").  Predictably, things go screwy on prom night, but Josie manages to deliver a story that has all of Chicago talking.
The flashbacks to Josie's teenaged years, especially the prom night fiasco, are incredibly touching and painful to watch.  The chance to go back to high school and be one of the cool, popular people is almost every geek's ultimate fantasy; as this movie shows, though, such acceptance by your teenaged peers does not guarantee happiness--what matters most is being true to yourself and to your real friends.  The love story component of the movie ends up seeming a little rushed and could have used a little more foundational structure, but its culmination is a beautiful, heartwarming thing.  Along the way, there are plenty of laughs, as Josie's attempts to fit in at high school are both pitiful and hilarious.
Look for a definitely pre-Dark Angelish Jessica Alba as one of the cool girls and SNL's Molly Shannon as Josie's friend Anita.  David Arquette is quite good (much less annoying than usual) but does not seem to merit the sharing of the main credits.  To be honest, this rather formulaic movie with its stereotypical depiction of high school society could have been a forgettable, disappointing experience had it starred someone without Drew's immense acting ability and natural charm.  For that reason I am giving it only four stars, but I must say I myself never tire of watching this funny, heartwarming movie.",1026345600,3,2379,4.9225
1052449,4,630557605X,"It's a good thing Drew Barrymore has [somewhat] recovered from her early 90s ""wildchild"" phase and gone back to being that sweet little geeky girl we came to love a long time ago.
""Never Been Kissed"" is just one of those sweet but geeky movies in which Ms. Barrymore, despite her well-known wild streak, is a perfect fit. It's not a deep, complicated movie, but a cute, sappy, first-date-on-a-Friday-night movie.
Barrymore plays Josie Gellar, a copy editor with the Chicago Sun-Times who was forced into going undercover as a high school student. The problem is, of course, she was a geek 10 years earlier as a real student, and quickly finds she isn't much better socially now. Until her brother, played by David Arquette, sneaks in and joins her. Her brother was a popular student and re-established himself as part of the lemming-like in-crowd. And along the way she falls in love with her English teacher, played by Michael Vartner.
Now, as a recently retired journalist, I worked at the local high school a lot. Once, I was even told by a teacher to get to class. Needless to say, high school wasn't that long ago for me.
As a newspaper flick, this is awful. Most copy editors despise the thought of being a reporter, most don't have their own office, most don't attend offical meetings, and most don't have assistants.
The high school half is better, especially illustrating the shallow nature of high school ""coolness,"" drawn with a colorful character cast.
I recommend this movie as a date-movie only. And on a cool side note, I once interviewed a guy who was an extra in this movie.",1026086400,2,1591,4.726618705035971
1052450,5,630557605X,"In an era where teen comedies are commonplace and come out one after the other, you get your good ones and your bad ones. Luckily, ""Never Been Kissed"" is one of the good ones. What makes this teen comedy stand out from all of the rest is that it has genuine acting talent, Drew Barrymore included; a plot with meaning; and this film is often very touching.
 Josie Geller has graduated high school and holds a job for a prestigious Chicago newspaper. She needs to submit a story or her job and her boss's job are on the line. She is given the task of going undercover into a high school to get the scoop and what's going on in today's schools and to come up with a story. So, she's back in high school and she is picked on just like when she was originally in high school. This is the start to one of the most touching teen comedies that has ever been produced.

 There are many things that make this movie one to remember. The acting is great and you don't have just anybody thrown into this film. You get great acting talent with people like Drew Barrymore and David Arquette among others that hold skill in acting. This movie also has a plot that is cliched but gives more backbone to the cliches and the movie just seems very original. When there are flasbacks of Josie's days back in high school you feel for her character and you'll ask yourself, ""How can people be so cruel to one another?"" All of these things make for a great teen comedy that won't be forgotten. This is a movie for a comedy fan that wants a touching story.
Happy Viewing!",1021852800,2,1547,4.291095890410959
1052451,5,630557605X,"Heartwarming and hilarious, Never Been Kissed takes you down a path of self-discovery for Josie Gellar (Drew Barrymore), a shy copy editor for the Chicago Sun Times.  At a staff meeting one day, she is given the chance of a lifetime.  She gets to be an undercover reporter and she'll be going back to high school.  She is incredibly excited until she realizes that none of her co-workers think she can really do it and her brother points out that she was a loser in her high school days.
Unable to cast aside her past experiences and doubts, Josie is unable to overcome her insecurities until her brother Rob (David Arquette) convinces her that all she needs is to believe in herself, and have someone else believe in her.  With his help, she begins to find her wilder and more free-spirited side, both in and out of school.  This attracts the attention of the popular kids and the eyes of her English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), who she begins to fall in love with.
Unfortunately, as her romantic feelings begin to blossom for Sam, her boss decides that her romantic interests in Sam (and his reciprocating feelings) must be the story.  This causes Josie to almost ruin any chance she might have with Sam just so she can save her job.
In the end, she writes an incredibly popular story about her self-discovery.  She also apologizes to everyone who she hurt along the way, including Sam, who she doesn't specifically name.  She informs him of her feelings and asks him to please meet her on the pitcher's mound on the night of the state baseball championship for her first 'real' kiss.
NBK is a happy love story with some very sad flashbacks that help the viewer to understand the pain that Josie once endured and is now overcoming.  The performances by the entire cast are incredible.
This is definitely a great movie for teen girls, or anyone else, to watch!",1017619200,11,1872,4.6314199395770395
1052452,2,630557605X,"Josie Geller [Drew Barrymore] is the youngest copywriter with her own office at The Chicago Sun-Times. Gawky, clumsy and dressed in clothes that look like they came from the Salvation Army store, she is one of Hollywood's favorite characters - the goofy but lovable nerd. She wants to be an investigative reporter, but her colleagues tell her it takes guts and courage to be one. One day, the newspaper's tyrannical editor announces he wants an expose of high school life, and he gives clueless Josie the job. The first of her dreams has come true.
So far, so good. Never Been Kissed starts off like it is headed towards being a nifty satirical comedy. It is, until Josie walks through the doors of the high school. Then it comes dangerously close to becoming just another stock teenage comedy. The students and teachers she meets are all interchangeable with characters you see in almost every other isn't-high school-a-drag-but-don't-you-just-love-it-anyway movie. There are the two dream boats - one a student, the other a teacher. We have the blonde girls of the drop dead [gorgeous] club, the jocks without brains, and the nerds without a clue. And, of course, the apex of life before twenty - The Prom. [I should admit here that I went to an all boys' school, so there was no prom. Instead, we had a party that lasted from junior year until well into college. Worked for me!]
I am fond of Drew Barrymore, who co-produced this movie. Some critics have said her talents are worthy of her illustrious theatrical family. They may be right, but it's time for Drew to get past the ingenue roles. Besides, this is the second time in three years she has played a Cinderella. She did the far superior Everafter in 1997. It is too predictable to her going from an ugly duckling to a swan, as she does in Never Been Kissed, since she is one of the more beautiful women in movies today. She is hysterically funny before her makeover is complete. She is blithely unaware that she has bad hair, bad clothes and bad timing. She trips over things, and she walks into doors. Had she been in a movie where she stayed this way, I am sure the reviews would have been glowing, because she played against type. But this is a fairy tale, so she must be transformed. In the process, the whole premise of the journalistic expose falls by the wayside.
There are enough bits and pieces of old songs played in this movie to fill at least two CDs. This trend is becoming tiresome, because it is so blatantly commercial. The movie studio and the recording company are usually owned by the same conglomerate these days. They call it synergy, and, indeed, in some cases, the soundtrack makes more money than the movie. Still, the process is rarely a creative one, and I lately have begun to cringe when the newest credit line - Music Supervisors - comes on. What exactly is it that these supervisors get paid for? To get the most Oldies but Goodies for the least amount of money? Is it a full time profession? Will an Oscar be created for it?
Never Been Kissed had the talent behind it to stand well above the others, but this same talent chickened out and opted for the old tried and true. It's a case where sorry might have been better than safe.",1016668800,5,3222,4.576124567474048

Josie Gellar ( aka Drew Barrymore ) is a reporter for the chicago suntimes and as her first job as a undercover repoter, has to pretend to be a student in a high school.

She finally gets accepted and turns cool with the help of her brother Rob ( aka David Arquette ) and so on and so forth...
Drew Barrymore acted terrific as Josie in this movie and potrayed her role very well. David Arquette was ok in his role, but he didn't have much of a major role as such. The whole movie is fun, exciting and yet very touching!
The DVD version of the movie does not have many special features except for the wide-screen format and the theatrical trailer, but if you want to watch the movie in widescreen you should go and get it !!

1052538,4,630557605X,"First of all, a film that seems to relate in a way to this movie is Superstar.  Although, this film isn't dumbed up on purpose to show off Saturday Night Live's actors and actresses (even if this film stars Molly Shannon as well).  This is somewhat of an original piece of comic relief and fun that stirs a mix of romance, determination of popularity, cruelness to others, getting a second chance to make something of yourself, and sexual related laughs- including the hilarity given from David Arquette (Rob).
In this film, 25-year old Josie (Drew Barrymore), must go back to high school as an undercover reporter to get a hot sleezy story.  Knowing of her past experience in Sr. High, as the school's biggest geek, she tries to fit in by changing her look.  Right off the bat, she isn't a big hit (dressing in a chicken suit-looking outfit and spilling milk all over herself), and joins the math club- finding a ""nerd"" friend who welcomes her in (played by Leelee Sobieski).  But after her brother comes back to high school in search of getting a career in baseball, and receiving instant likeness and popularity, he spreads the rumor that Josie rocks, and she is in.  She goes from a loser to the Prom Queen.  With Guy, that one ""guy"" who makes high school worth going to for her, ""crunching"" on her, Josie's dreams come true, until the beans are all spilled at the prom and Josie falls in love with her English teacher.
I think that this is probably one of Drew's best performances, simply because it is the perfect film for teens and couples.  She is a character some will relate to, and the basicness of the whole film is easy to follow.  It doesn't take really disgusting jokes way to the limit, or fill up with sex, drug-use, and suicide- like many sick comedies do.  I must admit, I died laughing when Josie's dream date through an egg at her forehead driving by in the limo!  While cruel, it's hilarious.  There are many toned-down elements that make this film work.  It doesn't go over the top like ROAD TRIP, AMERICAN PIE, HALF BAKED or THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  The performances work, and the ending especially... which literally keeps you on the edge of your seat- regardless of whether or not you can predict it.  Molly Shannon's appearance is a delight (for once!), stepping off of roles like A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY.
For anyone who's dreamed of being the one everyone wants to be like, the popular one...  the prom queen (or king), this is the film for you.  (Or if you are just looking for a fun comedy or good date movie.)

The usual things start to happen. She falls in love with someone and yada yada yada. The cool kids against the geeky kids. The usual drill. Barrymore plays it quite well.

But, the romance between Barrymore and her teacher, played by Michael Vartan, has no fire. No spark. It was a wasted opportunity. SNL'S Molly Shannon is one hand for some great comedic relief.

She tells this to her brother, and he let her remember how things were for her in high school, which was all forgotten. ""Do you remember what they called you in high school"" says Rob (David Arquette who plays her brother). ""Josie Grossie"" Josie replies. She all remembers and tells to herself in the mirror that it is a very bad idea.
Her first day is a complete disaster: Anita (Molly Shannen plays her colleague) has picked out the worst outfit you could imagine. The second disaster is that she comes late in class and has to wear the sombrero (a Spanish hat). And the third disaster is that she says that she comes from Billy- Bali (suburb of Bali) and tells that her parents are sheep farmers. And all these disasters are happened in like 15 minutes.
After a while when she almost has given up hope, her brother Rob comes and help her out as the popular kid. He helps her to be popular, so that she can get her story.
Her boss (Garry Marshall) is filming everything she's doing, since Josie can't find her story. Josie falls in love with her teacher Sam Coulsen (Michael Vartan), and her boss has found her story: Sam Coulsen. ""It's like the Young and the Restless I am watching everyday"" says her boss.

1052780,5,630557605X,"First and foremost, I would like to say that I heartily disagree with Mr. Dave McCoy's editorial review. Mr. McCoy stressed that there was a ""complete inability to buy Barrymore as unattractive, awkward, and  unpopular."" This could not be further from the truth. In ""Never  Been Kissed,"" Drew Barrymore stars as Josie Gellar, a news reporter  for the Chicago Sun Times. As the film opens, Josie receives her first  undercover assignment: she must enroll in a local high school, where she  will collect information about teenagers today. Josie, though excited by  the challenge, is worried: her own high school years were spent as an  unattractive geek, being endlessly ridiculed and humiliated by her peers.  Despite what Dave McCoy said, Barrymore plays a very convincing role and is  completely believeable as a geek. David Arquette, who plays Josie's lively  brother Rob, also puts in a great performance. And Michael Vartan, who  plays Josie's English teacher and the object of her affections, does a  great job as well. This movie has an excellent ending, and it teaches you  that your status in high school does not affect your career or your plans  for the future. ""Never Been Kissed"" is the first movie I have  seen in a long time that is both hilarious and meaningful at the same time,  making it a definite ""must-see"" for everyone. I highly recommend  this wonderful film to anyone looking for a great flick, even if that  person has, well, never been kissed.",961632000,47,1469,4.902439024390244

When my sister and I saw Never Been Kissed on HBO, I knew that my prediction was totally wrong. As a fan of romantic comedy, I  found it very enjoyable. Drew stars as Josie Geller, and is a reporter for  a newspaper. She disguises herself as a seventeen-year-old to see how high  school kids are acting these days. She makes friends with the popular girls  and is soon the most popular girl in high school. Drew's nerdy friend was  played by Leelee Sobieski, a great actress. This is a movie that teaches a  very important lesson.",961632000,2,626,4.495575221238938

If you want a movie that makes you feel god, get  ""Never Been Kissed"".",961372800,2,306,4.280701754385965

Drew Barrimore is charming as Josie Gellar, a 25 y/o reporter working undercover as a high school student. Her first major assignment is  to write a story about teenage life in the late 1990s. What evolves is a  heartwarming and captivating tale about ""fitting in"" and falling  in love.
Never Been Kissed shares some plot elements with other classic  high school movies (Say Anything, Can't Buy Me Love, Breakfast Club, 16  Candles)...but it has many unique qualities, and stands very well on its  own merits.

Although there are some scenes which seem  outlandish, for the most part, the film is an accurate portrayl of the  cruelty which is a part of high school, and how every girl just wants to be  accepted and popular. Barrymore's character is especially poignant when she  mentons how in the real world, no one cares if you were a nerd or a prom  queen, and she adequately expresses that there needs to be understanding  and kindness for everyone. Another important theme in the film is that  sometimes ethics and morality need to come before ""getting the  scoop."" If only all journalists felt that way, the world would be much  better off. Yes this does appeal to teenagers and there are important issues  for them in it, but adults would do well to visit those issues as well, and  be entertained in the process.",960336000,,980,4.449438202247191

And she's so  clever she chooses a script with the worst aspects of an old Shakespeare  plot cross-bred with Cameron Crowe.

I laughed during several scenes especially the night at the reggae club and  the peguin/banana/condom scene. David Arquette was so funny as her brother  who helps her become popular and Molly Shannon was terrific too.

As a  teenager, everyone wants to be that prom queen or student body president,  but this movie proves that being the most popular kid in school is not  talent or skill, or even luck, but a choice.

I'm not a  'teen' and I still enjoyed it thoroughly.  Drew Barrymore is great and  totally believeable as the nerd who is an ugly duckling on the outside but  a swan on the inside, who returns to school for an undercover job as a  reporter, where she ultimately finds herself.
When I saw this at the  pictures, the whole audience was totally absorbed by the film and vocally  sympathised with Josie's humiliating flashbacks and laughed out loud at her  charming awkwardness.
David Arquette as her 'cool' and 'popular' brother  was inspired casting and Michael Vartan as the teacher she falls for plays  his part perfectly.

Speaking from the point of view of a mother with teenage children of her own, I found this movie delightful. Obviously, Dave forgets a few important  facts: Of course this movie's plotline was thin and  cliche (I've learned  not to expect originality from Hollywood),but then Dave McCoy is not a  member of the movie's intended core audience: teenage girls (many who have  given their review here).  I think Dave needs to realize that some movies  are meant to just entertain. Drew Barrymore was believable as a geeky teen  and although there were exaggerated character types (popular girls;dumb  jocks), It's hard to deny that such social circles do exist in today's  schools. In essence, I would like to say that the movie accomplished what  it set out to do: (as one other reveiwer stated) make a girl feel ""all  gooey inside!""",950486400,3,904,4.875

1053063,5,630557605X,"First off I want to say I strongly disagree with Dave McCoy, writer of the Amazon review for Never Been Kissed. Did you see the movie? Drew Barrymore put in a beautiful performance. And yes, I can believe her to be a  ""dopey, unattractive"" newspaper reporter trying to relive her  high school experience. If you saw Barrymore in The Wedding Singer you will  agree that she played a very well poised young woman, not a ""geek to  the core"" girl. When I first watched this movie I felt sorry for  Barrymore's character, regardless that in real life she is a movie star and  beautiful person. That has nothing to do with the movie. When you walk into  a movie theatre you don't think about the star's status in the lime light  but of what they're trying to portray and I think Barrymore played a very  convincing role. Movies are made to wrap us up in the feelings and emotions  of the characters so that we can relate to what the character is going  through and I felt what Josie was going through. The next time you watch a  movie, Dave McCoy, I suggest you leave your ideas of the star's status at  home and focus on what the actor is trying to portray. I believe Barrymore  portrayed Josie better than any actress in Hollywood. I mean, can you  honestly see Neve Cambell or Gwyneth Paltrow in this part? No. And those of  you looking for a romantic movie that makes you grab your heart and scream  for joy all at the same time, buy this movie. It has everything from a  forbidden love, waiting to be lit by the desires of two people, a man who  sees a woman instead of a girl, waiting for some sign that the passions of  his heart can be revealed and a woman, still a girl in many ways, waiting  for the perfect moment when she will know that the one she yearns for is  the one right infront of her, to a man just waiting for his chance to make  the big leagues. It's a story of growing up and finding yourself. And the  ending is wonderful. What every kiss should be like. A must see for all  romance lovers.",946944000,94,2009,4.26525198938992

You truly cannot dislike the movie or plot.  Sure it may be a little far  fetched, have a few lame jokes, and predictable, but there's more to it.

I  think it was really good and i consider it ONE of my favs along w/, 10  Thing I Hate About You, and St. Elmo's Fire(don't laugh cuz i do like 80's  movies for your info!), and Ferris Bueller's Day Off(another 80's chic  flick movie! haha)  Okay, I think i'm finished now!",945820800,,491,4.563218390804598
1053148,4,630557605X,"I've never thought of Drew Barrymore as a particulary good actress, but in this movie she proves me wrong, and plays a fantastic, charming and embarrasing character. I can't remember the last time a movie made me laugh  so hard. You gotta see the scene where she goes wild at latin concert, it's  1st class comedy! An ordinary, but very watchable film!",945734400,2,352,4.661290322580645
1053149,5,630557605X,I loved this movie soooo much. I could not stop watching it. Drew Barrymore is a great actress and so is David Arquette. I loved the part where they are at the prom and she is chosen the prom queen. i can't wait  till i get this movie & soundtrack. I recommend you watch this  movie!,944784000,2,283,4.035714285714286
1053150,5,630557605X,"THE STARS : Drew Barrymore from The Wedding Singer does a great job playing Josie Gellar,a reporter who wants to be cool and make a good article at the same time! David Arquette from Scream also does a great job  playing Josie's sister. THE PLOT : Josie Gellar (Barrymore) was a  high-school geek and still is! As she goes back to school with her brother  (David Arquette) they both fall in love, have success......and Josie  changes from been a geek to been the most successful journalist ever!",944611200,,495,4.655172413793103

IT IS THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR.. YOU PPL HAVE GOT  TO BUY IT! YOU WON'T BE SORRY..,944438400,2,257,3.508771929824561
1053152,4,630557605X,"The Teen Movie is an intricate part of teenage culture. Never Been Kissed definately joins the ranks of ""The Breakfast Club"" and "" Ferris Beuller's Day Off"". Drew Barrymore plays the part of Josie  without pretention. She is wonderfully effervescent and absolutely  hilarious. The plot may be slightly cliche, but it is so well done that it  is not even a factor. There are numerous parts in the movis that do  ring  true about the politics of High School,and it looks at the whole experience  with much humour. So,if you are looking for a no-brainer that will have you  laughing till it hurts, this is the movie.
PS. Who is that gorgeous  TEACHER (lucky Drew)",944352000,3,660,4.678260869565217

man this is one of my all time favorite movies, it was the most excellent film I have seen in a long time.  It really meant something.  And all of you people saying this movie was horrid and awful  and said they couldn't act, u are so wrong.  This movie was great and it  seems to me that u are the ones who couldn't see a good movie if it was  shown right in front of you.  Yes I am a teen and you a probably thinking i  like it only becuz its a ""teen-flik""  you are so wrong.  My mom  even liked this.  I definately recommend this to everyone!",944265600,2,564,3.981981981981982

I would suggest that you rent it only if you want to see an overweight Drew Barrymore, unless of course you want to keep a permanent copy of the weight factor for your records.  It is a  terrible story and very poor acting with bad dialogue, nothing really good  about this movie.",943833600,3,317,4.322033898305085

My favorite part is the part in the club when she eats the  ""chocolate cake"" and starts dancing! Oh its hilarious! I could  NEVER keep a straight face while watching that movie! I give it a 10 on a  scale from 1-10! Its that good! To make you laugh the hardest you've ever  laughed and even cry! Drews the best!",943228800,,471,4.131868131868132

We had already been cracking up over the previews  seen on other videos and went to see it on opening night.  Yes, a  ""dopey, formulaic, predictable romantic comedy"" it may be, but I  can't wait for more! I think Drew's choice of movies lately have been great  for families: Wedding Singer, Ever After, Never Been Kissed. These are all  funny and can be enjoyed over and over by both kids and their  parents...together. Who could ask for more?",943142400,,616,4.495495495495495

1053244,5,630557605X,I love it! Great reality check--I could totally relate to her--although I didn't have to go back to High School to figure things out. The price is a  little outrageous for now. I'll wait for it to go down for the video!,940896000,,219,4.214285714285714
