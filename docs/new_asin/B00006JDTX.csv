7970163,5,B00006JDTX,"I found this dvd to be creative and engaging.  The lesson was presented in a way easily understood by my 4 year old.  Better than that...the lesson actually sticks with her.  She loves the video!  I love that it's a bit slow paced.  Not too slow...but engaging and even.  A nice pace similar to Little Bear.  Relaxing and not too much craziness just to get attention.  The focus was on the lesson being taught.  This video sparked imagination and not stole it like many ""shock for kids"" dvds can be.",1263513600,,499,4.455555555555556
7970164,3,B00006JDTX,This Dvd did not hold my kids(4yrs & 1 1/2yrs) attention. After watching it for 3 minutes they walked away. I have tried it several times and still the same response. The funny thing is I got the idea off of the cable channel(Comcast On Demand) and the kids loved it. I realize that is because on the cable channel they showed the best parts and that is the singing(great songs) but the story is boring and to long before you get to the singing. I will keep trying it as they get older. The animation is very colorful with great looking charactors. The story might be a little to mature for them at this age.,1141171200,,608,4.25
7970165,5,B00006JDTX,"Top line: This video is outstanding, as are the other two in the series. My four-year old son and I highly recommend it and we hope SoSmart! Quickly adds more titles.
I purchased this video because my son loved other titles from this company (""Colors"", ""First Words"", ""Shapes""). I was not disappointed. My four-year old son has a lot of videos (Disney, Baby Einstein, Nickelodeon, you name it)... this video and the other two in the series are the best video products for children that we own. My son has asked to see all three videos over and over again. The colorful and original animation, fantastic songs (as an almost professional shower singer I love singing along - they are wonderful), and clear moral make it a hit with our entire family.",1043193600,3,747,4.666666666666667
