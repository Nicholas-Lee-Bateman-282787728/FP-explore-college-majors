8218073,3,B000VD5I26,"This material presents the nervous system as it claims, but through some lengthy narrations and it jumps from one interview to another. In my opinion, a good documentary must succeed first to captivate the viewer attention by instigating the audience and viewers curiosity then keeping it awake. It may by just a matter of preference though. Otherwise, it touches the main and specific aspects it claims it approaches. I give it 3 of 5 stars.",1279584000,4,442,4.906666666666666

8218075,3,B000VD5I26,"I bought this DVD for my anatomy class, as I am not fond of lecturing over the nervous system...I thought it would help give them an overview before I lectured.  It was okay, but not great.  It definately didn't overload them with information; all it really did was cover the very basics...a little more detail would have been better.  This video would probably be best suited for middle school anatomy, not college-age.",1224547200,14,420,4.805555555555555
