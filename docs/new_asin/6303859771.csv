HALLOWEEN HAVOC 95

Spoilers

1.[TV TITLE]DDP VS JOHNNY B. BAD-great opening match with a great pace. The action is back and forth for the most part but DDP cheats throughout making it very interesting. In the end Bad wins but it was a great contest between the two. A new TV champion.

2. RANDY SAVAGE VS THE ZODIAC-this was a squash match basically as it only took Savage a few minutes to top the Zodiac. A fan jumped in the ring early on and once they took the fan away Macho Man would hit that elbow for the win.

3. KURASAWA VS ROAD WARRIOR HAWK-this match is another quick one but is longer than the last. Hawk basically dominates the match until the end and ends up losing as Parker helps Kurasawa get the pin.

4. SABU VS MR. JL-excellent match right here as both men give us that high flying style that would soon be coming by way of the cruiserweight division. The crowd is wowed by these two men, Sabu in particular. Great offense and skill shown by both but Sabu would come out victorious, and JL would take a fireball to the face courtesy of the Sheik.

5. LEX LUGER VS MENG-this match gets hated on a bit and while it may be a little long for these twos styles I liked it. I remember thinking at the time that I was liking the storyline of is he or is he not in the DOD. So this was a battle of two of the stronger guys in WCW and for the most part it was good. They trade momentum until Meng seems like he is going to win when The Taskmaster kicks Luger giving him the win. Meng didn't understand why his leader would do that, but the plan would show its self later.

6. RIC FLAIR & STING VS ARN ANDERSON & BRIAN PILLMAN-the story going into this was Flair was going at it with his former Horsemen. Still even though he didn't want to trust him Sting still came to the Nature Boys aid and agreed to be his partner. But earlier in the night Flair it seems was laid out by his former friends. So this was basically a handicapped match with Sting against Arn and Brian. This was a good match that would see Sting start strong but eventually the numbers caught up with him. Flair would eventually come out to a huge pop from the crowd. The tension was built wonderfully as Sting would keep getting close to tagging in Flair but just barely missing it. Flair looked crazy wanting to get in so bad and when he eventually does the place erupts. But then he attacks Sting and the Horsemen are back.

7.[SUMO MONSTER TRUCK MATCH]HULK HOGAN VS THE GIANT-well this was just Hogan and the Giant driving monster trucks that were connected to each other. It lasts for a bit and then Hogan wins, of course. Afterwards the Giant attacks Hogan and eventually falls off of the building.

8. RANDY SAVAGE VS LEX LUGER-now Savage didn't trust Luger and thought he was actually with the DOD. So the thing was if they both won their matches earlier in the night then they would get to face each other. So the match starts after Savage attacks Luger instead of shaking his hand. I was and still am a huge Macho Man fan so I was so looking forward to this match when it happened. Thankfully for me Savage would win after Luger runs into Jimmy Heart. The match had some back and forth to it and was a good  match. Their feud would continue for years.

9.[WCW TITLE]HULK HOGAN VS THE GIANT-so the Giant obviously survived the fall and didn't even get wet from falling in the lake. Despite this match having a crazy ending the match was a good one before that as far as Hogan standards. The Giant ends up winning the match by DQ as Heart nailed the ref and was officially representing Hogan although he switched to the DOD. Then Savage and Luger come down only for Luger to show he was with them as well proving Savage right and attacking the Macho Man. Still the worst sight was seeing the yeti do a double bear hug with the Giant on Hogan, trust me it looks ridiculous.

Overall the event was good in my opinion. That ending was just not great, but there were some good moments before this. Of course I have fond memories because the Macho man won twice at this event.",1465171200,,4062,4.274739583333333
7853630,5,6303859771,"I loved it from start to finish and it was great. I used to have it when I recorded it on pay-per-view but I decided to get rid of it in the garbage but I decided to order it from the seller that sold me this tape and I have it once again and it got very exciting in the beginning because I liked it when Hulk Hogan facing against The Big Show which he was back then The Giant. They was facing off in a monster truck match and they was facing off for the WCW Heavyweight Championship and it got very bizarre in the ending and just like I said, it was great and was the bomb. Thank you very much, yours truly, Zaida M Quijano.",1351728000,,625,3.890625
7853631,2,6303859771,"Another tape I found in an old box someplace.  For those unfamilar with this time period of WCW, they were really pushing Kevin Sullivan's ""Dungeon Of Doom"" stable of monsters & freaks against Hulk Hogan & his friends (Randy Savage, Jimmy Hart, Lex Luger) to the point where Hogan himself went to the ""darkside"" and started wearing black to show his evil side.  Also during this time, Ric Flair & Arn Anderson were feuding with each other and while Anderson found a partner in Brian Pillman, Flair begged Sting to be his partner for weeks after Sting couldn't trust Flair based on their past.  Also, Randy Savage kept having problems with Lex Luger based off Savage's belief that Luger is a member of the Dungeon Of Doom.

WCW Television Champion Dallas Page vs. Johnny B. Badd - This was when DDP started to really improve his wrestling skills & it showed here as him & the man most know as Marc Mero had an opening match that had a good pace & mix of wrestling and Badd's high flyin' along with a couple of side moments featuring the DDP's crew of the Diamond Doll Kimberly & Maxx Muscle.  Great opener.

Randy Savage vs. Zodiak - Savage & Luger had stipulations on their matches in that if they won them, they would face each other later on in the right.  Savage won his squash match that lasted only two minutes.  The only thing noteworthy here was a female fan jumped in the ring trying to get at Savage.

Roadwarrior Hawk vs. Kurasawa - This match was real short & nothing noteworthy here.

Mr. J.L. vs. Sabu - For those who don't know, this was Jerry Lynn under a mask as a luchador before luchadors became regulars in WCW while Sabu was accompanied by his uncle & Hall Of Famer The Original Sheik.  This was fast paced with Sabu showcasing his daredevil offense to the point where Sheik was caught in the line of fire in the beginning of the match.  The match wasn't long but if your a fan of the quick high flyin' daredevil action you would would see in later years from the crusierweight/X division wrestlers then you would enjoy this.

Lex Luger vs. Meng - In a nutshell, this match was just too long, too dry, and just bored the crowd.  The only noteworthy part was the ending where Kevin Sullivan got Meng disqualified so he would face Savage later on in the night.

Sting & Ric Flair vs. Arn Anderson & Brian Pillman - Don't let the title fool you, this was a handicap match as Flair was ""attacked"" backstage leaving Sting to go out there alone against both men.  This was about Sting using all his energy to fight off both men until the odds caught up to him as Flair would appear later in his street clothes & bandaged up.  The match told a good story but will always be memorable for what happened when Sting was finally able to make the tag to Flair as it lead to the reformation of the Horsemen.

Sumo Monster Truck Match: What they did here was have Hogan & Giant's customized monster trucks welded together & they had a sumo-type match over on Cobo Hall with the winner being able to push the losers truck out of the circle.  It really wasn't much to watch unless your a huge fan of monster trucks but Hogan ended winning before getting into a confrontation with Giant leading to him falling off the roof of the building.

Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger - Due to both men winning their previous matches, they get to face off with each other here.  This match was just average between these two are it was really came off as a filler for the commentators to talk about what just happened with Giant along with why Jimmy Hart was at ringside...which would be answered later on.

WCW Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Giant - This match was the sterotypical formula you've seen from Hogan vs. ""Giant/Big Man"" matches in the past with the likes of Earthquake, King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd, ect.  Hogan would get beat down & worn down with getting in a few short-lived comebacks here & there before finally Hulking Up, beginning to overpower, and eventually slam Giant.  Right here is where all hell breaks loose as you find out that Jimmy Hart & Lex Luger were members of the Dungeon Of Doom by attacking Hogan & Randy Savage along with the appearence of the Yeti (which was short lived) before Giant walked out with the World Title.

In the end, this PPV was barely passable as this was more about setting up new & continuing old storylines instead of having a good card.  The only standout matches were the DDP/Badd & the short J.L./Sabu encounter.  Unless you were a heavy fan of WCW during this time period, I would pass.",1218585600,,4531,4.440821256038648
7853632,3,6303859771,"The Giant Hogan war of the monster trucks was sweet, and the Giant falling off Cobo Hall was hilarious. Check this tape out if you want to see some funny stuff!",919209600,2,160,4.193548387096774
