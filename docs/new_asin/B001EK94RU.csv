8298449,4,B001EK94RU,"I actually bought this to the frame the monthly movie posters on my wall. No complaints about this product. The paper is shiny, so if you're buying this to use as a calendar, keep in mind that it might be hard to write on.",1264550400,2,222,4.068181818181818
8298450,3,B001EK94RU,"As a Calendar it's great and the movies go way back;
 you get 4 DVD's 3 movies on each DVD.
  I guess they were great in there day and it's nice to go back in time
and see how they made the low budget movies with some big stars.
  And it's not a bad deal for the money; I know places charge that much just for a Calendar. Hope this helps.

8298451,3,B001EK94RU,"You could call this a ""drive-by review"".  I came across this series of ""movie classics"" calendars while poking around... looking for a calendar for next year.  These sets look like they might make nice gifts for movie buffs as well, *but* at the present time Amazon does not tell us what the contents of the disks are; an important omission!
In case you are curious, as I was.  this set (Musicals Film Classics 2010) includes the following (information retrieved from another web site):

Till the Clouds Roll By
Calendar Girl
Stage Door Canteen
Career Girl
Royal Wedding
The Duke is Tops
Sunny, Breakfast in Hollywood
Second Chorus
Mr. Imperium
The Fabulous Dorseys
Hi-De-Ho

Hopefully this information will help others who might be interested in this, but don't know whether or not they already own copies of the films.

I'll note, that I found the contents with help from a comment left by another customer on a review of a different set in this series.  Thanks!",1260835200,,964,4.806060606060606
8298452,5,B001EK94RU,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is an avid Classic Monster fan and collector.  A few years ago, I happened across a calendar with the Classic monsters in them, and he was so surprised and thrilled that I've made it a mission to find SOME thing similar each Christmas. The only thing I found close this year was this calendar. I hesitated to buy it because it seemed to be a rehash of others I had gotten, plus the DVD's it offered I knew my husband HAD to have already. But when he opened it, he was DELIGHTED to find the obscure classics with pictures and the fact that the DVD's [which yes, most if not all, were in public domain] coincided with each month of the calendar. The man got a PS3 for Christmas, and I think his favorite gift was STILL this Horror Film Classics calendar.  I'm not a classic monster OR horror OR B-movie fan, but this was obviously the Right Gift at the Right Time for the Right Fan. You buy 'em what they love.  That's all I know.",1231286400,7,975,4.231182795698925
