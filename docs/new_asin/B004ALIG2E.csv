8420388,4,B004ALIG2E,"This box set is also available in a combo set called ""Route 66 and America's National Parks"" containing ""Route 66 Marathon Tour Chicago to L.A."" and ""America the Beautiful."" So you save when you buy the two together. For the fans, there are lots of other DVDs on Route 66 and National Parks, so compare before purchasing.",1368057600,,321,4.649122807017544
8420389,5,B004ALIG2E,"I am not sure what the previous reviewers were complaining about.  If you want to see incredible HD scenery of some of America's great national parks, this series certainly delivers that.  It's not fast paced and the dialogue is minimal.  If you are looking for a super quick fluff program, you may want to look elsewhere.

This DVD allows you to drink in and enjoy the great vistas and creatures of the land as if you were there.  It also makes a terrific background wallpaper for my screen during parties and family get togethers.  You can always just mute the audio and play whatever you wish while this is running on the screen.  Personally I am tired of all the fake reality garbage that fills my cable box.

If you would like to enjoy great HDTV images, then this set will certainly make you happy.",1343174400,3,804,4.496551724137931
8420390,1,B004ALIG2E,I agree wholeheartedly with the previous review and will add that I was only able to get through it by fast forwarding at 32x with the SOUND MUTED.  Pitiful that someone could actually ruin panoramas of this beautiful country.,1342137600,2,226,4.794871794871795
8420391,1,B004ALIG2E,"When I bought this set I thought, well, how can you go wrong at this price?  You can.  I knew I was in for trouble after the first lingering (and lingering) shots of an Alligator in the Everglades.  The sequence on the Redwood Park of Northern California is better, then it leads you down for a view of life in the nearby Pacific,  But, guess what?  The next scenes are of tropical Caribbean fish and bottom fauna, including the Blue Surgeonfish.  Whoops!  Not the giant kelp forests of the Northern California Coast.  I'll admit that some of the shots are good, particularly when there is no panning (when the animals are moving by themselves).  The panning action is not tracked, but done by someone making a circle while holding the camera in place.  So, you get none of the parallax or depth information that we are used to seeing in ""fly through"" cinematography.  If you still think this is a good value for you, try it and let us all know what you think.",1303344000,8,960,4.459770114942529
