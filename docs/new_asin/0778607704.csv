29797,5,0778607704,"I remember years ago I would go to the library with my grandmother and pick out this video every october. I had not seen it since,but for some reason I suddenly remembered it and was searching for a long time. I could not describe the animation,only i remembered that it was like still pictures,but the camera made it look as if they were moving. Glenn Close reads this book extremely well. I have ordered this ""book on video"" and I cant wait to watch it.",1210377600,,455,4.364705882352941
29798,5,0778607704,"This is another version of the ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", or the Headless Horseman, based on a short story from Washington Irving that was published in his book ""The Sketch Book of Washington Irving"".
Rabbit Ears is a production company that used to produce audio stories in the 1980's for the radio, using famous actors to do naration. They were high quality productions, featuring classic stories, and folk tales. In addition, they went to great lengths to locate just the right composers and music artists to fit each tale. Very enjoyable.

Many of those Rabbit Ears shows were released on audio cassettes. Later they produced a combined package of the tape and a new book to accompany it, finding unique authors to give the stories a new look. Finally they decided to merge the books with the audio into a video.

So basically, this is a book on tape, with still illustrations set to outstanding music by Tim Story. The narration is by Glenn Close, and she manages to hit just the right tone of spookiness. The audio on this VHS is an exact copy of the original radio show that Glenn Close did for Rabbit Ears in the 1980's.

It is very well done, a half hour in length.",1126224000,8,1174,4.580952380952381
29799,5,0778607704,"This is yet another animated version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow worth recommending, but not to be confused with the Disney version. Some reviewers have left reviews for certain versions on the wrong pages at Amazon, as so many do not have a picture. But if you check for the studio, catalog  number, and date of release it will help. It is easy to confuse these, there are quite a few live action and animated versions available by different studios. It is amazing that the short story of the headless horseman as written by Washington Irving has inspired so many films.

The one on this page was produced by Dave Adams and Nick Bosustow of ""Bosustow Entertainment"" in 1974. Some of their productions were often shown in theatres in the 60's and 70's, but this short film was released to video by Little Golden Books/Western Publishing in 1992.

This film is a wonderful little combination of highly stylized limited animation and illustrations in a very unique art style. The story is narrated by John Carradine, rather than voicing individual characters, although you can hear the characters mumbling or laughing in the background. Has some very effective sound effects. The music is by Larry Wolfe, and while it is not period music as in some versions of this tale, it is good jaunty music indeed. Ichabod Crane is drawn with the longest leanest limbs ever, and he looks almost like a scarecrow at times. The animation character design reminds me of the stylized School House Rock cartoons. It often features single-color characters against colorful backgrounds with more drama and atmosphere. Directed by Sam Weiss who worked on the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle Show"", and ""Mr. Magoo"". The animation was by Vincent Rassols and Tom Roth, based on the still illustrations by Bill Davis. The bold colors are very different from other animated versions of this story, and do their part to set the tone. The backgrounds and illustrations of the forest are very well done. It packs a lot of story into just 13 minutes.  Creepy enough to be fun, while it will not terrify the kids either, and is perfect for a Halloween party.

You probably know the basic story by Washington Irving. A timid school master named Ichabod Crane arrives to teach in an early American village of Dutch settlers. He falls in love with the daughter of a wealthy farmer, but she is also being courted by the mean Brom Bones. Brom knows that the schoolmasters weakness is scary ghost stories, and gets his chance for revenge at a party. Spooky tales at night seem to bring the most notorius ghost out for a visit to Ichabod from the headless horseman.

There is a second story on this VHS which is also 13 minutes long, ""The Three Golden Hairs"", produced by the same studio in 1978. This story brings to life the wonderful illustrations of Eric Carle. A wicked queen tries to destroy a little girl because of a prophecy that the girl will become queen. The queen's tricks backfire, due to her greed. This one also has very unique artwork, and it is narrated by Hans Conreid.

I remember listening to it and being so petrified to move...and then restarting the CD over again when it finished. I've spent years tracking down the hardcover book, the audiobook and soundtrack, and the video, but it is so worth it. Glenn Close does an absolutely superb job infusing this classic story with heart and pathos and chilling terror. There's just enough from the original text that you know this is a retelling, but her delivery (especially her voices--the ""old Dutch wives"" scene is phenomenal!) makes you feel as though you're the one sitting around a country fire in the very witching hour of Halloween night hearing this story for the very first time.

29846,5,0778607704,"I had a cassette tape of this story when I was a child back in the mid 90's. I must have worn it out from listening to it so much. The music is still incredible, even in 2015, to a young boy who loved supernatural things. Combined with Ms. Glenn Close's voice - especially during the ghost story scenes, in which she's particularly chilling-sounding - this made for a wonderful nostalgia trip for me. I definitely, DEFINITELY plan to share this with my own, not-yet-created children.

Everyone else owes themselves the favor of watching/listening to The Fool and the Flying Ship and Pecos Bill (harder to find - but check your local libraries!) which are voiced, incredibly well, by Robin Williams. A completely different feel to those stories compared with the spooky eeriness of this one (still gave me shivers today, after 20 years) but wonderful in their own way.",1431993600,,867,4.78

Interesting how the cartoon is only slightly animated - eyeballs and mouths move, as camera focus slowly moves closer to object in view, captures the old-fashioned feel quite well I thought.  My daughter (9y/o) said the ""prettiest girl in town"" was not that pretty, so she didn't like the drawing of the girls... Oh well.",1414195200,,507,4.56043956043956

29869,5,0778607704,"I originally enjoyed this as an audiobook years ago. Since my car does not have a cassette player, I have not been able to enjoy it though I remember it quite well. Glenn Close does a superb job narrating this story. It is a 30-minute abridgment (versus the unabridged version of the Washington Irving tale that is 1 1/2 hours), but it is also expected for a younger audience. When I was looking for something to play as a reward for my elementary students, I looked to see if this was available on YouTube. It was, but the quality was less than ideal. Then, when I saw the moving pictures associated with the text, I thought that perhaps it was available in that format from the start. So, off to Netflix and Amazon to check it out. Bingo! Amazon had the animated version AND it streamed for free.

The animation is comprised of static images flipped back and forth to produce a sort-of movement. It isn't 'true' animation like Disney's ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad,"" but it pairs well with the story as told by Glenn Close. As I previously stated, her voice over is charming and brings the characters to life. The pacing of the story flows nicely, though I have to admit that the introductory music is a bit too long before the story actually begins. Once it does, though, it's pure enjoyment. Both of my children (8 and 10 years old) loved it. The retelling is spooky without being frightening.

Most of them run for less than half an hour, and each is narrated by a speaker with fine professional qualifications.  The real draw is the story, and the slides or animation add visual interest.  Most of the stories are fairly close to the originals we remember from childhood and such alterations as there are add interest and entertainment.  We recommend all of them and suggest sharing them with your children and grandchildren, especially because the younger ones have often not read or encountered the stories.

Because they are short and hold one's interest, try one and you'll be hooked, unless you are happen to be an old curmudgeon.

This one is close to Washington Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow, which is at some variance with the TV series Sleepy Hollow.",1399334400,,835,4.886524822695035

29884,4,0778607704,This is a great kid's/ family friendly movie for Halloween. Not too scary and easy to follow for thier short attention spans.,1384905600,,125,4.7272727272727275
29885,4,0778607704,"Great story for kids. It was Halloween and they wanted to watch something ""scary"".  For a 5 and 8 year old, it was perfect.",1384214400,,123,4.125
29886,5,0778607704,"This video takes you on a charming journey with an actual sense of traveling as the view changes as though you were walking along with the characters. While it is abridged from the original work, largely due to the visuals making much of the descriptive writing dispensible; still, it remains ""true"" to Washington Irving's evocative tale. Ms. Close brings her considerable ability of character interpretation to full execution with obvious relish for the story. She may read to my inner child any time",1383955200,,501,5.048192771084337
29887,4,0778607704,Script was entertaining and the art well done.  Enjoyed the story.  Our grandchildren were entertained by the story.  Just long enough so they were not bored.,1383523200,,158,5.0
29888,4,0778607704,This was actually really well done.  Glenn Close did a great job with the narration and the paintings were also really well done.  I enjoyed how it felt like someone was reading a story.,1383436800,,186,4.4411764705882355
29889,3,0778607704,"The production was fine, just not what I had expected.  I actually did not watch the entire broadcast to the end.",1383350400,,113,4.380952380952381
29890,1,0778607704,For your children only. Only in english and no subtitles. The cartoon  is very short but with good production. I recomend this.,1382745600,,127,4.7727272727272725
29891,3,0778607704,"The story is still as good as ever and Glenn Close does a great job telling it.  However, it does not beat the classic Disney cartoon.",1382227200,,134,4.153846153846154
29892,1,0778607704,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a great story. My boys and I tried watching this version and it was horrible,1381968000,,107,4.142857142857143
29893,1,0778607704,Not what I expected. No animation- not what I needed for a middle school class..The dancing cut outs were sad to say the least.,1381881600,,127,4.333333333333333
29894,3,0778607704,"If you want blood, chills, and that wobbly feeling in the pit of your stomach, look someplace else. However if you want to sit with the little ones and hear a story told by the same gal that cooked someones pet bunny....this is the place. So gather the (not too young) kids and get ready for a nicely told tale.",1381708800,5,311,4.2
29895,4,0778607704,Love Meryl Streep as narrator. Easy to use in classroom.  Illustrations are beautiful and animation is unique. I will use again.,1381190400,,128,5.095238095238095
29896,5,0778607704,"Glenn Close's beautifully modulated narration sustains the right note of skepticism without condescension.  She conveys the fun of beguiling us with a tall tale (Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow""), maybe more than half believed.  So do the formalized, often sunlit, early autumnal ominousness of Robert Van Nutt's illustrations, and of Tim Story's gently insinuating music, which is like the promise of a creepy good time whispered in our ear.  Computerized animation may look so ""real"" that imaginative involvement isn't necessary or even possible.  The minimal animation here goes the opposite way.  It's very satisfying, because the images use historical research so wittily (Katrina's curling hairstyle, for instance, with its hint of something mischievous and not quite straightforward in her personality) that we want to linger over them.  They seem set in memory, at just the right distance in the past, remote the way a tall tale should be.

Children who prefer computerized marvels may not find all this intriguing; but it's a very handsome, all-of-a-piece production.  When my niece was six  years old she recommended it highly.  We both still do.",1380844800,5,1173,5.360655737704918
29897,2,0778607704,"I purchased the video for my middle school students after they read the story.  They were bored with it.  It was much too babyish for grades 6, 7, and 8.  I guess they're used to seeing much racier movies.  I wouldn't show it again to my students.",1374883200,,247,4.191489361702128
29898,1,0778607704,If you're looking for a quick way to show this film then this verison is for you....if you're looking for the disney version with all the details then don't be cheap and just buy that one!!! The quality on this is low and not very entertaining. The bonus was the cost to return it was more expensive then to just keep the movie so I was offered a full refund while keeping the DVD.,1369785600,,381,4.162162162162162
29899,4,0778607704,"but with Glenn Close narrating you can't go wrong. I thought it would be more animated but it was still a well narrated story by one of my favorite actresses. Plus, I wanted to relive a classic in classic form because I forgot the original ending. Also because it reminded me of the first time I heard it. I was in the second or third grade and we had substitute teacher this particular day. He decided to read the story to us and I thought from the description of Icabod Crane that he was describing himself. The man was the same height and build as the character. He even had a pointy nose. The only differences were the teacher was African American, had an Afro and wore glasses but the description had us all saying the same thing, ""He's talking about himself."" If you're wondering how we could have thought that about him, he knew the story by heart....or at least a majority of it. *wink* Enjoy!!!",1367625600,,903,4.413173652694611

29902,3,0778607704,"The narration by Glenn Close is very good and the original story by Washington Irving is related very well. However, the special affects are something like an animated puppet show, so it is easy to see why the video is inexpensive.",1356480000,,231,4.658536585365853

The artistry and music are amazing, and Glen Close narrating was great too.  I still watch this every October, even though I'm much older now.  It's completely timeless!

7789299,5,0778607704,"This video is perfect. As a multi-decade New Englander (and a male elementary school teacher and dedicated fan of this eerily entertaining tale), I want a quality adaptation with a unique take. Jeff Goldblum's version had character development, but filming in Utah ruined it. Johnny Depp's version was gory but atmospheric, and came closer to capturing our eerie Northeast landscape. Hallmark's version (filmed in Canada) was actually the closest adaptation in terms of mood and character development,  but it is not widely available, and Canada isn't the nuanced eerie New England that this story requires (our woods and valleys have a presence that all who enter feel and understand) . This video is a nice introduction for younger viewers, as well as a quality addition to the serious collector's assemblage. The Dutch paintings are spot-on, gorgeous, and help narrate the story. The music ties in perfectly. Glenn Close's narration is solid, but perhaps the story's only flaw (and a very minor one at that; the male characters that Close narrates sound a bit less than their teue characters). Overall, Highly recommended!",1508025600,,1125,5.2154696132596685
