8166515,1,B000M5KA58,"Is this like a ""grab bag"" of WWII footage, or are you afraid to tell us what is inside the box? I'm guessing that it's a one-star deal!",1250467200,,135,3.857142857142857
8166516,4,B000M5KA58,"The 4 star rating is for the value.  The general quality of the videos is poor with a few exceptions.  They had to cut down the quality to fit all the footage on the DVDs.
Here is what is included:
DVD 1: 4hr and 54 min The Air Force Story - I don't know exactly what this is but it is a 25-part documentary/propaganda series of 12-16 minute episodes detailing the history of the Air Force from the Wright Brothers to the final scene showing F-86 Sabres and it does not mention the Korean war so like 1949 maybe?  Maybe early 1950?
Bonus material is a feature on Test Pilots - Pushing the Envelope

DVD 2: 4hr and 37 min The Great Generals Series - Documentary episodes on the 6 or 7 most famous American Generals of World War II -  I couldn't find any history on this at all. Patton, Eisenhower, Marshall, 'and others'. MacArthur, Hap Arnold, the usual gang.
Bonus Feature: Voices of War

DVD 3: 3hr and 40 min Hollywood Goes To War - 15 Shorts made by the Yollywood stars of the time to educate (propagandize) America's wartime audience.
Bonus Feature: War Goes to the Movies

DVD 4: 4hr and 47 min This DVD contains a number of German oriented films:
""Here is Germany"" U.S. Propaganda film 1945
""Adolf Hitler"" Re-enacted documentary on Adolf Hitler from 1959
""Campaign in Poland"" German documentary/'packed full of lies' film showing the 'German reasons for invading Poland' from 1940
""Warsaw Ghetto"" - could not find any history on this film - says 1967
""The Nuremberg Trials"" - This is the 1946 film that basically propagandized the Nuremberg Trials using actual footage from the trials.  Not for the feint of heart. NOT RATED.
Bonus Feature: Short Docu on Industrial Warfare

DVD 5: 3hr and 4 min - Japanese Oriented stuff
""Kamikaze"" - 1961 Film documentary on that subject
""Know Your Enemy: Japan"" - 1945 (it says 44 but it shows Iwo and Okinawa so it must be later) by Frank Capra, the Japanese counterpart to ""Here is Germany""
""December 7th"" - I believe this is the memorial documentary film that was released on December 7, 1943 about Pearl Harbor

The second half of the DVD is Color WWII films, don't get excited the quality is generally poor (I have a large TV and the pixels are the size of Rhode Island)
""To the Shores of Iwo Jima"" 1945 Documentary on that topic. Pretty good.
""With the Marines At Tarawa"" (says 1943 but my digging around gives a Reldate of Feb 2, 44)  The action was 11/43 so 2/44 seems more believable to me.  It is actually one of the better films in the collection.
""The Battle of Midway"" 1942 This gem is the original color documentary of the battle.  I say it is a gem because it is really bad but you could tell they had no idea what kind of audience they were dealing with - I think it even pre-dates the Capra Propaganda Docs. It was clearly cobbled together from as much actual battle footage as they could find.  It has cheesy voice over narrations from 'next door neighbor-type' personas, a technique thankfully dropped in later Docs.  Otherwise awesome.
Bonus Feature is ""Propaganda: the Quiet Weapon"" - nice touch

DVD 6: 4hrs and 24 minutes - Anglo-centric films
""Know Your Ally: Britain"" 1944 (I think 45) Capra Film - first of the Know your allies and enemies series cut short by the end of the war.
""Attack! The Battle for New Britain"" 1944 - This is a GREAT Documentary especially for how soon it was released after the actual action.  I chuckled about it being on this disk because the New Britain action was almost totally a U.S. Forces action - has nothing to do with Britain other than the name of the island.
""Desert Victory"" 1943 - AWESOME FILM - won a special 1943 Acad. Award but don't get too excited the quality is rather poor. This is the one everyone has heard of.
""Target for Tonight"" 1941 Early R.A.F. Bomber Command propaganda film for promoting the strategic bombing of German cities.  Not a documentary - more of a docu-drama. Basically, it  docudramas a typical British night bombing raid from the perspective of the air and ground crew. I think it is great just because they don't make them like that any more and I am also an enthusiast for the British night bomber stuff.
""The Battle of Britain"" 1943 - this IS the Capra film that everyone already has in their ""Why We Fight"" collection so I was a bit puzzled why they bothered to include it here.  Filler I guess.
Bonus Material: Documenting the War (nothing profound)

So, there are a few gems here but as you can see the quality is poor and the dvd's are jammed.  I feel good about paying [...] bucks for it but I am an enthusiast of the genre, and I wouldn't expect a non-enthusiast to be tolerant of the poor quality.  NO effort was made to clean anything up.",1246406400,,4686,4.487058823529412

8166518,1,B000M5KA58,"I'm sure I'm not the only Amazon customer who has complained numerous times to customer service about these sets being for sale without listing the titles of each movie, the stars, and a brief synopsis of the plots....come on Amazon....do a BETTER job of listing these DVD's so the customer knows before he makes a purchase just exactly what he is buying. I for one am NOT going to buy a DVD without knowing just what movies are on the discs. Also, Amazon refers the customer to [...] for more information and in a lot of cases the movie is not listed there either.",1180742400,7,565,4.4423076923076925
