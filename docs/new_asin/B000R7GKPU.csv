2859179,5,B000R7GKPU,"I really enjoy cartoons, but I think there's no comparision with the old ones, like Tom and Jerry. The plots, the music, the drawings, everything is amazing!",1287100800,,157,4.851851851851852
2859180,5,B000R7GKPU,"Aside from Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry was one of the best cartoons ever produced.  They are on equal terms with Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies.  William Hanna/Joseph Barbera was probably the best cartoons, along with Fred Quimby.  The backgrounds, layouts, drawings and animations were first rate.  Tom and Jerry, when produced/directed by Chuck Jones carried on the tradition with a very sincere and most respectful effort, but somehow lost the spark of the earlier cartoons.  Everything about Jones's production was first rate though.  The worst produced/directed happened when Gene Deitch took over some of Tom and Jerry.  Every aspect was some of the worst cartoons ever produced by trying to update their comic war with each other.  The animation was substandard at best.  Overall, the spotlight collection is a must for any Tom and Jerry fan, along with some of the Tom and Jerry Tales.  Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes continue to be above all the crowd as being the utmost BEST cartoons to be produced and very much carry weight over the poor animation of the cartoons of today.",1268611200,4,1084,4.972222222222222
2859181,5,B000R7GKPU,"This collection is well worth your money. It is like the ones with Fred Quincy or the ones where the Hanna-Barbera duo worked one. Not the garbage Chuck Jones or that European trash that is just made of fail (music in those just plain suck). This collection gives you like 800 minutes of excellence all unedited, so you can see how America was like in the 40s to 60s.

Recommendation: Like Tom and Jerry, buy this immediately",1264809600,,425,4.51948051948052
2859182,4,B000R7GKPU,"I grew up with these cartoons and always thouht they were hilarious.  Turns out they still are... the cartoon creators of that time were comic geniuses.  I can still watch these cartoons and others of the time like Bugs Bunny and still laugh my arse off (despite the occasional racial depiction).  It fell short of five stars because there are a few repeats throughout the six discs and disc two of volume two has some of the ""newer"" episodes of the mid and late fifties that had inferior animation and were not that funny.  Overall, highly recommend for the Tom and Jerry fan.",1259280000,,577,4.572815533980583
2859183,3,B000R7GKPU,"Just to clarify, so that anyone considering this three-volume collection will have ALL of the relevant info in making their purchase decision: Reviewer K. Echols ""kyle"" is correct in stating that the included cartoons are unedited (...well, except for a few minor points and some aspect ratio issues); but what he fails to mention (and is perhaps just unaware of) is that the Tom and Jerry Hanna Barbera Spotlight Collection IS in fact censored in the sense that two of the T&J HB cartoons, ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat,"" are omitted from the collection altogether. Warner Brothers issued a statement about why they chose to omit those two cartoons; that statement is posted in the reviews for Volume 3 if you'd like to read it.

Also, WB did initially ship Volumes 1 and 2 with some edited cartoons--not EVERY controversial cartoon on those two volumes was in edited version, but SOME of them. (Using the edited versions was however a mistake, not WB's intention, in those first two volumes.) To correct the problem, WB established an 800 # and gave away free replacement discs. I don't know whether the versions of those two volumes that you'd get if you bought today would have the edited or the corrected discs (although I would like to assume the latter, if WB is being responsible).

It's entirely possible that those who are less intimately acquainted with the original versions of these T&J cartoons wouldn't even be aware of the edits in Volumes 1 and 2--and many people may not be bothered by the edits anyway, which is fine. But if you think you got the edited versions and that's NOT what you want, you might see if WB is still running the free replacement program; contact details are in the ""Comments"" that go along with my review of Volume 3. Also, you need to be aware that the replacement program is ONLY for Volumes 1 and 2--there is NO replacement program from WB to give you the ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat"" cartoons that were omitted from Volume 3--and there never will be, if WB stays true to what they've stated. (If you're not sure whether you're looking at edited versions or not and would like to know, just Google ""Tom Jerry Spotlight Collection""--you won't have any problem finding articles that detail all of the edits.)

I'm not telling anyone to avoid buying these sets. They're great for what they do have in them. But any review that represents this three-volume collection as ""uncensored"" and ""untouched"" simply isn't accurate; and I'd prefer that folks have access to ALL of the facts when they're choosing whether or not to lay out their money.",1255996800,161,2593,4.770601336302895
2859184,5,B000R7GKPU,"Amazing is all I can say.  A true masterpiece of animation and art.  The grandfather of all modern animation.  It is beyond cool to have all the episodes available in one package (as a set of 6 dvd's).  It's all here, uncut and unedited.  Loved by generations of children and now my children too.  On two of the dvd's (to introduce the character ""Mammy Two Shoes"") there is a dvd intro by Whoopi Goldberg as she describes how America of the 1940's and 1950's was.  There is some politically incorrect humor and ethnic portrayals.  In retrospect, I think a lot of it is overblown, but can see how some could be offended.  However, I think Whoopi does a good job explaining it to anyone who for some reason has never seen Tom and Jerry before.",1253923200,3,741,4.42962962962963
2859185,5,B000R7GKPU,"I saw these dvds in stores or online and thought,""Why bother buying them for they are still on the Cartoon Network?, and nothing new."" But I gave it a shot and then thought, ""I should have bought them sooner"". So,...No regrets. Glad I did.
Tom & Jerry was the first cartoon series I began watching once I grew too old for Sesame Street in the afternoon. I caught on that the both of them are very destructive tyrants, and there is constant raucus, plus endless dentistry bills. I can't imagine two small animals with that much carte blanche? They have no perimeters. Worse than bull in china shop. Jerry is more an instigator than antagonist. Jerry is also the hero of smaller or less sophistcated animals. Protecting either a fish, a bird, a duck or another mouse probably related to; trying to stop or thwart the ever preying Tom. At moments it's more than Jerry can handle but if he can lift an anvil he always regains control. Every now and then there is a bulldog cameo who sometimes I felt sorry for when half the time only trying to protect his son and wants to be left alone. All three characters are very manipulative and know exactly how to anger each other.
The Academy Award winning episode ""The Cat Concerto"" was then and still is my very favorite, and have two copies of it also from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warner-Brothers-Home-Entertainment-Academy-Awards-Animation-Collection-15-Winners-26-Nominees/dp/B000ZOXDKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection - 15 Winners, 26 Nominees</a>. For a while I needed to know what that wonderful music adapted to it was?

Like the rest of them are perfectly timed with The MGM Studio Orchestra, and outrageous sound effects made it Hanna-Barbera's most sensational effort. No other cat and mouse routine surpasses...Tom & Jerry.",1249862400,19,2218,5.663663663663663
2859186,5,B000R7GKPU,I'm loving Tom and Jerry since i was a child. This DVD collection added so much value to my existing collection. I sure will buy another collection.,1243296000,2,148,4.518518518518518
2859187,5,B000R7GKPU,"There has been alot of nay sayers about this Tom and Jerry,  but I went ahead and baught it (season 1-3 spotlight collection) and it was utterly uncensored and digitally remastered. I cannot vouch for anyone else's products for other stores, but Amazon is selling the REAL deal, and yes, it is very, very racist. So for all of you old-time Tom and Jerry fans like myself this Tom and Jerry collection is incredible and UNTOUCHED! I would have been extremely disappointed if it was censored because it should be left up to the individual to choose what he/she watches, and people need to realize that this series came out in a very difficult time for Americans. Fortunately, myself being of a newer generation, I never even realized the racist puns and jokes until someone pointed them out to me, which shows how much Americans have progressed over the decades.
Tom and Jerry is still an smash hit for kids and adults and I, being 23 years old, simply watch it everyday and I love every minute of it. I cannot believe they are selling it for only $15 per season. If you love, like, or merely find Tom and Jerry amusing at times then I highly recommend that you buy it and since I have the unedited original from Amazon, I would assume that the safe bet for getting these seasons un-tampered with would be from Amazon, which is usually much cheaper than other sites and there is the free shipping dealt oo (gotta love that, right?)",1243209600,58,1429,4.538759689922481

As far picture goes, it is very good for a cartoon like tom and jerry. Sound is good too. The packaging for the set is good too. Very good artwork. I know the shorts aren't in order but c'mon it can't be perfect. It is actually more fun not knowing what's next. I really like these sets. They exemplify Hanna Barbara at their best.

2859199,1,B000R7GKPU,"Highly offensive, and insensitive introductions.

The beginning of these discs contain extremely offensive language concerning the possible lack of Political Correctness of these cartoons.  Why aren't the same warnings on movies like, Gone with the Wind, Song of the South, Casablanca,  Ghost Breakers?

2859212,5,B000R7GKPU,"Its a classic. Tom and Jerry have been around for ages I'm just glad I am able to still appreciate their antics now though so different from ten years ago. Looney Toons actually made a big change recently as well, regarding them I've had mixed feelings but comparing how Tom and Jerry has evolved though mostly classic cat vs mouse there are plenty of spin offs to keep you laughing. I bought this to give my nieces a little piece of that classic comedy and they grew to love it so much they watch at least three episodes daily.",1446508800,,528,4.343434343434343
2859213,3,B000R7GKPU,"Me  &  my  younger  sister  use  to  watch  this  show  all  the  time.  I  know  this  show  very  well.  Jerry  usually  teams  up  with  another  mouse  smaller  then  him,  once  in  a  while,  or  a  baby  chicken,  &  even  a  fish  from  the  fishbowl.  Tom  is  always  after  Jerry  &  fails  at  Jerry's  expense.  Sometimes  they  must  work  together  as  a  team,  or  lookout  for  each  other.  I  found  out  Jerry  does  have  a  soft  spot  in  his  heart  for  Tom  after  all.  &  I'm  sure  he's  read  in  the  bible  about  forgiveness.  There  are  times  when  he'll  let  things  slide.  &  times  when  he  won't  let  things  slide.  Tom  hardly  recognizes  the  true  meaning  of  friendship,  &  does  win  the  battle  against  Jerry  in  some  episodes.  However  being  reasonable  with  each  other  comes  &  goes.
&  Jerry's  not  the  only  trouble  that  Tom  sometimes  gets  into.  Tom  also  has  trouble  with  Bulldog  Spike.  &  Spikes  son  that  we've  seen.  A  small  puppy.  While  chasing  Jerry  he  can  sometimes  get  into  trouble  with  Spike.  &  the  case  is  closed,  Spike  thinks  like  this  (Tom  save  your  apologies  &  excuses.)
Tom  won't  stop  though  &  sees  &  uses  all  different  kinds  of  methods  to  catch  the  little  rodent,  doing  scientific  experiments,  reading  books  telling  him  how  to  catch  Jerry  or  any  mouse,  or  calling  an  exterminator  company.  None  of  the  gadgets  Tom  uses  hardly  outsmarts  or  outwits  Jerry.  &  Jerry's  always  smiling  like  he's  proud  of  what  he's  done.  Or  proud  of  himself.  Some  us  of  cheer  for  Tom.  &  my  guess  is  the  senior  aged  people  like  our  average  grandma  &  grandpa.  I  can  only  picture  any  grandma  or  grandpa  sort  of  picky  or  determined  to  be  rid  of  some  little  pest.  &  probably  despise  a  little  rodent  that  makes  holes  in  the  walls.  Little  girls  in  the  world  will  probably  take  Jerry's  side.  &  would  consider  Tom  a  usual  bad  hombre.  One  can't  say  enough  about  some  of  the  episodes  or  Toms  reaction  when  he  gets  burned  or  if  something  lands  on  his  tail.  His  face  turns  red,  or  he  lets  out  a  loud  scream  like  he's  really  in  pain.  That's  what's  funny,  when  Tom  sometimes  get  hurt  he  screams  like  it  hurts  like  hell.  I'll  be  honest,  (When  Jerry  gets  serious  he  sometimes  realizes  that  he  can  whip  Tom  &  get  him  at  his  mercy!)  I've  only  seen  Jerry  roar  like  a  lion  once  when  Tom  stepped  over  the  line  in  an  episode  where  Tom  hits  an  infant  little  gray  mouse  with  a  flyswatter.  Afterwards  Tom  was  forced  to  be  nice  to  him  &  feed  him,  &  Jerry  had  that  look  on  his  face,  (if  you  move  just  one  inch  I'm  gonna  whack  you!!)  Jerry's  got  a  lot  of  Guts!!  I'll  say  that!  In  some  episodes  where  he  tries  to  teach  Tom  a  lesson  he  won't  forget!!!!!!!!!!  These  2  do  pretty  much  everything,  when  &  when  they  don't  have  their  own  special  guests!
The  show  is  a  laugh  for  anyone  who  loves  cat  V/S  mouse,  Tom  &  Jerry!  From  the  looks  of  it  this  is  not  the  complete  series.
My  idea  or  anyone's  idea  about  having  every  episode  ever  made  on  DVD  or  blue ray  would  be  something.  Tom  &  Jerry  goes  a  long  ways  with  the  seasons  &  series.  I  like  the  70's  80's  the  best!  You  think  this  14  hr  collection  is  about  everything  Tom  &  Jerry  have  to  offer?  Man  if  I  was  the  producer  &  director  of  this  show  I'd  have  the  entire  series  out  on  DVD,  with  of  all  the  episodes  ever  made  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  the  complete  series  was  200  or  300  hours.  Imagine  that  on  DVD!  I'd  just  love  to  see  them  do  it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hopefully  it'll  last  another  10  yrs.  before  they  consider  cancelling  the  show.  With  of  all  the  changes  this  world  makes  anything  can  happen!",1446336000,2,4065,4.283950617283951

Volume two has a five minute disorientation by Whoopi Goldberg on how inappropriate these cartoons and how injurious and offensive these ""cartoons"" may be.  Come on, they are ""CARTOONS"".  The one caricature that I assume they are ""WARNING"" us about is the black woman that is always after Tom with a broom.  This character was pattern after an actress named Hattie McDaniel who played ""Mammy"" in ""Gone With The Wind"".  She won an Academy Award for that portrayal.  She was a great actress with a long career but the producers of this set and Whoopi Goldberg wish to belittle her achievements by labeling these funny classic cartoons as racist.  Please, these are cartoons and just cartoons.  I pray that no one is dumbest to set children in front of these cartoons as a life study.

Many of our favorite shows had housekeepers or cooks like Bonanza, Brady Bunch, Family Affair, My Three Sons, Courtship of Eddie's Father, and nobody apologizes for their film content.  Anyway, the short clips are great, humorous, and I enjoy them now as much as I did when I was young. The kids enjoy them, too, and none of them have been racially scarred by these cartoons.

2859251,4,B000R7GKPU,"I've been a long time fan of Tom and Jerry, and the duo never get old enough not to be appreciated, by any generation. Let's face it, no other cartoon characters can pull off slapstick comedy quite like these two can. It comes so frequent, so sudden, so predictable or even at times, unpredictable, but it is just golden.

That being said, you'd think that Warner Bros. would put a little more effort into the essential collection of such a legendary duo. Now do not get me wrong, this collection is brilliant, and holds all of my favorite episodes that I can think of right now, and even if it didn't it is still worth buying. But you'll notice something in Volumes Two and Three that is a little...no...it's pretty annoying. Episode repeats.

I don't know who was in charge of putting these together, but you'll notice (ESPECIALLY on Volume Three) that there are duplicate episodes that appeared on the earlier volumes. I wouldn't have brought it up if it were only a couple episodes, but there are numerous episodes that appear, or are almost a copy-and-paste of another episode (there's a Thanksgiving episode on Volume One, which has an ALMOST COMPLETELY identical episode on Volume Three). And it takes up quite a bit of runtime. When I bought this collection, I thought I would be getting Tom and Jerry at their best, and this is them at their best, but I know that they had other episodes worth putting on here rather than duplicates and other similar stories. I'm unsure if these duplicates were accidental, but if they were I would hope they would not only have been fixed, but the guy putting them together would have paid more attention, because after seeing a duplicate when it happens, it starts to make you think that the purchase was a waste of money, when the rest of the collection just seems great.

Other than that, I really had no other complaints. These collections are essential to the Tom and Jerry fans, and are a real blast to the past. If you can look past a few duplicate episodes, this collection is perfect.",1408838400,,2037,4.621546961325967

2859259,5,B000R7GKPU,"For the longest time, I've watch Tom and Jerry on regular TV, and guess what? I am sick of the pan and scan versions of those widescreen shorts, and they sucked so much. I had problems with the pan and scan. On the TV version of ""Barbecue Brawl"", the ending was terrible, such as when that ant was playing with a horn, the camera only focused on Spike, doing nothing. Also the TV version of ""Tom's Photo Finished"" was abysmal, such as when Tom got shocked by a snapshot and his head popped from his body, the stupid camera only focused on Tom's legs while his torso is on the left and his head is on the right. I've watched the original widescreen versions of those shorts, I became totally satisfied. I can understand why 2 shorts, ""Casanova Cat"" and ""Mouse Cleaning"", were banned from these sets and that short, ""His Mouse Friday"", was edited at the end. There is a lot of hate in this world and I can respect these bans. I've read about that ""Coonskin"" incident that happened back in the 1970s, even though I wasn't around back than, but I can feel their pain of what it's like being offended. I don't care about these sets being criticised. I only cared about the shorts being seen in widescreen and that's all that matters to me.",1393545600,,1234,4.393013100436681

2859298,5,B000R7GKPU,"The Tom-and-Jerry legacy chases through every nook and cranny of the classic animation pantheon, spanning six decades and several famous directors. Looney Tunes icons Friz Freleng, Tex Avery, and Chuck Jones all played their part. But the enduring cat-and-mouse team was the brainchild of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Their first short Puss Gets the Boot (in which Tom was called Jasper) was released with little fanfare. Fellow animators did not consider a cat-pursuing-mouse scenario too exciting or original. But when unleashed on exhibitors and audiences, their hilariously diabolical rivalry delighted everyone. This 6-disc set of 115 restored and remastered shorts (along with fabulous celebratory bonuses) includes 12 Academy Award nominees and seven winners. And with this in hand, you're a winner too!

2859300,4,B000R7GKPU,"This is a terrific collection of Tom and Jerry cartoons.  It includes nearly all of the classic shorts  made during the great MGM period of the 1940's and 1950's.  This is the best DVD collection of these cartoons currently available.  I am very pleased that they were presented with no cuts or editing.  These are works of art and should be respected as such.  Unfortunately two cartoons, ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat"" are not included for political correctness reasons, which is a real shame and why I deducted a star.

 Scott Bradley's music is wonderful, and the animation is outstanding.  I would love to see these cartoons on Blu ray at some point.  I would also like to see more Tex Avery cartoons.  He was an animation genius, and it's easy to spot his influence on Tom and Jerry during this period.",1296604800,9,813,4.654929577464789

8199021,5,B000R7GKPU,It's a great collection. Nearly all of the 1940s and 1950s. The exception is the episode Texas Tom (1950-03-11) was in the set twice and they didn't include the episode Casanova Cat (1951-01-06). It's sad that it is missing one episode but it is a great lineup and I can't knock off any stars. Now I just need to get the rest from the 1960s to complete my collection.,1501372800,,367,4.333333333333333

8199023,5,B000R7GKPU,"In these 3 volumes of the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection, you'll get virtually all the shorts of their original Hanna-Barbera era from 1940 to '58, including almost all of their CinemaScope-made shorts remastered in their original Widescreen presentations, plus a ton of bonus features! Sadly, none of these have Mouse Cleaning or Casanova Cat due to being deemed too offensive, especially for the Black people who are watching these! What's more, the finale of His Mouse Friday was greatly altered for the same reasons! Not even the WB listened to Jerry Beck about putting any of those shorts in volume 2 of the Tom and Jerry Golden Collection, completely unaltered. Most of the Fullscreen-made shorts in these Spotlight sets are un-remastered but uncut! It was Chuck Jones who used to think Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera did nothing but Tom & Jerry shorts at MGM, but boy, was he wrong! They also made a bunch of one-shot shorts in Tom & Jerry's early years, plus the CinemaScope Droopy shorts, 2 shorts of a short-lived spinoff series called Spike and Tyke, and the 1955 CinemaScope remake of 1939's Peace on Earth, by Hugh Harman, called Good Will To Men (and both shorts received Oscar nominations)! Tom & Jerry ended up winning 7 Oscars and 6 more nominations, for 13 of their shorts, including their debut short Puss Gets the Boot, when they were called Jasper and Jynx! Sadly, the shorts of the Gene Deitch and Chuck Jones eras never received that kind of status, not even 1 nomination each! If you wanna see how Hanna-Barbera really got started before making their own TV cartoons 60 years ago this month, July 2017, look no further than the trilogy of Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collections, which were made for theatres from MGM and for adult moviegoers to begin with! To quote Tom, ""AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!"" Scary, but true! And it was Bill Hanna that did a lot of the sounds for Tom and Jerry and their co-stars, especially the loud screaming! Happy 60th anniversary to Hanna-Barbera's TV studio, with this review of their early works for the big screen! Even during their TV years, Hanna-Barbera made another series of theatrical shorts, only for Columbia, and was recently rediscovered, remastered, and put on DVD by the Warner Archive, called Loopy de Loop, from 1959 to '65. Not many people OR historians knew about ""ze Good Wolf"" until his own DVD collection came about several years ago! You won't be sorry with this collection, either, now that CN doesn't run ANY classic toons anymore! Maybe at Christmastime, but that's no excuse, to quote my mother's motto from my semester at Asheville High in 2002. Like my endless troubles at Asheville High, purposely excluding Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat from Tom & Jerry's Golden Collection, and these Spotlight Collection sets, is also so bad, it's inexcusable! Better to enjoy these sets for what they are, than to wait for the Golden Collection sets to conclude, because it'll be a cold day in Blazes before that collection finishes unaltered!",1499904000,2,3002,4.876712328767123

I'm glad I got my hands on this set of DVDs before the next liberal/socialist gets elected and declares Tom & Jerry to be enemies of the state due to the inherent ""racism"" portrayed in these classics. Some of the other reviewers of this set were quite upset that Whoopi Goldberg made the introduction (one lady furiously returned it!). I myself am not at all a fan of Whoopi, an out of touch millionaire celebrity Hillary supporter who has no grasp whatsoever of the real America which lays just outside of each of her gated, guarded homes, but watched her intro and found that she gave: A. Credit to the creators and the entire institution of Tom & Jerry itself. B: A brief bit of commentary (perfectly reasonable) about how times were different then with regard to potrayal of blacks on screen. I was not at all upset with what this woman had to say, even though I am thoroughly disgusted by just about everything else she brings up! Good collection, 5 stars!!",1493683200,3,1003,4.634831460674158
