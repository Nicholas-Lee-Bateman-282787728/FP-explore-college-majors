8410017,3,B003Z8ZCGQ,"For anyone who already owns Cream's Farewell Concert dvd from November 26, 1968 at the Royal Albert Hall, you already know the content of this Cream-Sunshine Of Your Love:Live In Concert dvd. This dvd contains just the concert songs, eliminating the narration and off stage interviews from Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. The film quality isn't the greatest, due to the rough 1968 original film, and the quality actually seems better on the Cream Farewell Concert dvd. However, just the music is here for those that don't want to listen to narrations in between every song.

If you want a better pre-order price, I have noticed that if you type in Sunshine Of Your Love- Cream dvd, without typing in Cream first, the same dvd comes up at $5.00 cheaper. Even with the poor quality that this film is from 1968, it is still a tremendous rarity of Cream and well worth buying, and the only reason I'm giving this dvd 3 stars is because it's quality seems not quite as good as the Cream Farewell Concert dvd and because it's another remake.",1286409600,17,1046,4.654054054054054
