7306922,4,B0108UW4TG,"Anton and Vlad are a gay couple in modern Russia - a place where extreme views on same sex relationships are still publicly rampant. The authorities too seem complicit in the way homophobic attacks are ignored. Then Anton and Vlad see a man being beaten on the streets, and Anton wants to stop and help - Vlad has a different view.

They later find out that this was a homophobic attack and Anton wants to do the work the police won't do and track the attackers down. This is the story of that search.

Now there are some that moan when we have yet more depictions of homophobia in film because it has all been done before; but for a great many men and women this is a reality of life and by highlighting this gross breach of human rights and even decency we may be able to bring around change. So for that I applaud the film makers. It is also well acted and has some excellent direction and use of cameras and angles. Some scenes could have been shorter I felt, but that is a minor issue in what many will rightly see as an important film. It is a difficult watch in places too, but that is of necessity deliberate - recommended to those who appreciate the gay film genre in all its many colours.",1440979200,7,1198,4.25
7306923,4,B0108UW4TG,"I feel like I often repeat myself when reviewing DVD releases by TLA Releasing. They bring to DVD a wonderful example of a vast array of truly magical, artistic and important pieces of Gay Cinema; Cinema period. Stand is another prime example of a flawless choice to bring to DVD. Excellent in acting. The script is amazing. The chemistry and word play flow like watching strangers right in front of you. Stand is a film that is thick with drama and yet also takes the viewer on a journey of characters, and situations that the viewer feels, as emotions are displayed on screen.

A tightly weaved suspenseful drama. Very intense, and most of all dramatic. What would happen if you witness a brutal gay bashing? How would you handle it? How could you come forward, knowing that the very country you live in, are against gays? That is the reality of this unique and thoughtful film. The script just bleeds perfection in this brutal idea. Two gay men witness the brutal attack. They live in Russia. Russia has a huge stance and hatred for gays. The dilemma places the two into a spiraling game of choices.

What is unbelievable to me is the two main stars. Both Russian born. This being both of their first major feature film roles. Breathtaking in that idea. Both are gifted. Both create their characters in true life. Renat Shuteev plays Anton. Shuteev convinces me that he is a veteran at acting. The character of Anton is performed in an award worthy fashion that begs to be seen. Next I have to mention Andrey Kurganov who plays the character of Vlad. Another flawless performance that transcends an emotional ordeal off screen into the mind of the viewer. The whole cast comes together and works a tense story, both brutal and unnerving.

The direction by Jonathan Taieb is also award worthy. This is his second directing feature film. This French director knows how to create on camera the tight excellence of a drama, mystery that begs to be seen, and remembered. This movie should be watched and discussed in conversation. Taieb is a fantastic director. This film has everything a great piece of cinema is all about.

It was selected in many wonderful film festivals such as Houston GLBT Film Festival 2015, Torino Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, Mardi Gras Film Festival, Framelin: San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival, Mix Brasil, Galway Film Fleadh. It just shows you the talent and precise understanding of how great this film is.

I think the Gay Community or culture itself forgets that there are places still in this world that are bigoted and brutal. I am from America, we just passed Gay Marriage, wonderful, but there are still countries that hate and are bigoted against Gays and Lesbians and Bisexuals and Transgendered. They are still fighting the fight to be free. I think this movie showcases a wonderful example, and truly heartbreaking message that those who just want to be themselves, to love freely are being hurt. Countries that shame, lock up, hurt or kill someone for being who they are, are no different than the Slave owners of the South. Are no different than Nazi Germany sending innocent people to concentration camps.

Stand is a brilliant, haunting piece of cinema. Equal parts thick drama, and equal parts thick mystery, splashed with suspense. The characters are truly defined in this film. The direction along with the story, and acting create a piece of film that demands to be seen.

8721653,5,B0108UW4TG,"I am writing this review because all of the detailed reviews featured here are NOT for this movie... They must have been intended for another movie with the same title and accidentally ended up here...

If you are looking to watch the movie Stand that is about 2 brothers who have stepped on land mines please understand that is EXACTLY what this movie is about. I was so confused when I read the reviews here because that was what the movie stated it was about but the majority of these reviews appear to be a different movie entirely...

I gave this movie a 5 star review but honestly I would give it 6 if I could... It appeared to be very low budget as most of it was shot in the same location and the actors in the movie were not big name actors... Yet they still managed to portray a convincing relationship between the 2 main characters and a rather compelling storyline... The dialogue was captivating... Not to mention it sheds light on a subject that a lot of people may have otherwise been unaware of or conveniently forgotten about...

If you need a movie that moves along quickly or has a million plot twists or stars everyone in Hollywood you may be a little disappointed but if the premise of this film caught your attention i. The first place please give it a chance...

Job well done to those who took part in making this film.",1495497600,3,1343,4.403225806451613

8721658,4,B0108UW4TG,The film takes a few odd turns and is very bleak but it stands as a potent commentary of the state of intolerance in Putin's Russia.,1469923200,,132,4.115384615384615
8721659,5,B0108UW4TG,"If anyone has difficulty understanding the ending of this film it may help to consider the (VERY loose theological) parallel that I arrived at after some contemplation. Throughout the film Anton demonstrates a savior/martyr/Jesus complex and is relentless in his pursuit of justice for the young victim of a gay bashing. He manages to win over a few ""disciples"" that seem willing to advocate for justice and help his cause. Unfortunately, he becomes obsessed with his quest to the point that he repels his closest loved ones in his single-minded pursuit of the truth.

[SPOILER ALERT] At a critical moment a seemingly supportive & sympathetic ally steps forward and arranges his confrontation with the perpetrators/villains. This Judas character (who seems to believe he is acting according to Anton's wishes) documents the resulting martyrdom of Anton. The final scene depicts Anton's ""resurrection"" where he rises & walks into the dawn leaving the viewer without concrete knowledge of his ultimate fate (although I would guess it doesn't end well).
I no way do I mean to be offensive to Christianity, Christian beliefs or the Bible, but I thought there was a VERY obvious parallel in this film to the story of the Messiah - his disciple-gathering, his martyrdom, and his resurrection. I think the film addresses the age-old paradox of cause and effect in the Judas/Jesus dynamic. Without Judas would Jesus have been the martyr and savior that he is portrayed to be in biblical writings? Was Judas actually doing a good deed or even God's work by becoming a confidant and disciple of Jesus and then handing Jesus over to his killers (to fulfill his prophetic/fated role)? Additionally, in Christian tradition Jesus' death resulted in the salvation of humankind, so was Judas a villain or a hero for enabling his martyrdom? That is the question that I feel was left for viewers at the end of this film.",1461974400,3,1902,5.0
8721660,5,B0108UW4TG,"Had to watch it twice to untangle the narrative thread - well worth the effort. What I saw at first to be a well played thriller and a statement of social outrage, on second viewing turned instead into the fatalistic and tragic perspective on human existence whose roots seem to run deep in the Russian psyche. The Russian actors are all unforgettable, from the old lady who had survived WWII, to the youngsters whose only concern is self-sating frivolity. At the center of the piece are the obstinately self-justifying protagonist and the chillingly genial Satan who is only too happy to present the hero with a perfect occasion to martyrize himself.",1461369600,3,651,4.873873873873874
8721661,4,B0108UW4TG,"If Dostoevsky made a 21st century Russian gay movie, it would be like this. Philosophical narration, guilt, shame. At the heart of the film, a saintly looking, obsessed young man trying to find who committed a deadly gay bashing. Or is that really what he's doing? Some viewers were baffled by the ending. When I thought about it, it made sense. It's nice to have a gay indie film with a really complicated central character. Renal Shuleev is excellent in the central role.",1461110400,2,473,4.710843373493976
