44297,4,0783111509,All round good family movie. Friendship between dog and dolphin. Alittle romance for the grown ups and of course a bad guy played by Arnold Vosloo to round it out. I added it to my collection. Think you would enjoy it Lisa C.,1003881600,3,225,4.255813953488372
44298,5,0783111509,"I live part-time in the Bahamas on the Grand Bahama Island where this movie was filmed.  I rent my condo when I am not there and keep a copy of the movie there for my guests to watch.  I always recommend they do The Dolphin Experience (at Sanctuary Bay where many of the scenes were filmed) and actually get to pet Roxanne (real name is Kaylah).  Then I suggest lunch at Banana Bay Restaurant where the wedding and limbo scenes were filmed.  I know the limbo guy (King Barry) who performs at Port Lucaya (scenes from the movie were filed here as well) at night still.  This movie always has a more special meaning after experiencing all this.  If you plan a trip to Grand Bahama Island, by all means watch the movie, do the Dolphin Experience and have lunch at Banana Bay.  Any questions, please email me.",990576000,14,805,4.398648648648648
44299,4,0783111509,"I only watched this movie cuz kid actor Miko Houghs is in it, hes so adorable, and he is a great actor, basically the only thing keeping me entertained. Miko plays young Jordan. Overall I didn't like this movie well enough to give it a 5, but it's ok.",969753600,,251,4.142857142857143
44300,3,0783111509,any movie that has miko hughes in it is somewhat good according to my  standards. this one is also good beside his presance in the movie. the dog  and dolphin are cute. the movies fun. i don't know why people don't like it  its akids movie what do they expect.,968284800,2,260,4.16
44301,4,0783111509,"I know the general consensus is that the movie is a little too ""dear"", but I rather enjoyed it,--So did my Great Dane Courageous, who watched it entranced.  Perhaps the Dog-Dolphin connection  is real!--but then what I do for a living (surgical intensive care) is so  intense and so often lacking in happy endings that I take whatever  opportunities arise for an emotional vacation.  This was certainly that.  Steve Guttenberg was his usual Mister Nice Guy--he's done that same roll  several times (Three men and a Baby, Cocoon, etc.); he just says different  things each time, but he along with the tropical setting were nice to look  at anyway.  I'm less familiar with Ms Quinlin's vita, but I thought she was  quite creditable as a dedicated bio-oceanographer/dolphin specialist.  Certainly the quest for the elusive grant is a theme with which I am  familiar, working as I do at a university hospital.  I especially enjoyed  seeing veteran bad-guy Arnold Vosloo in a wonderfully comedic roll as the  villianous foil of dog and dolphin.  Some of the expressions on his face  when dealing with the assorted animals in the film were worthy of Cary  Grant in his comedy hay-day (Bringing up Baby and I Was a Male War Bride).  Probably the very best performances however were given by Zeus (the dog)  and Roxanne (the dolphin) who were some of the best trained animals I've  ever seen.  (I do hope Courageous was taking note, as he is often not the  paragon of polished canine behavior!)  My favorite scene was the  ""escape of Zeus"" by means of the balcony.  Definitely worth a  replay.",952128000,17,1585,4.79182156133829
44302,5,0783111509,"What a great family movie!  The story is based on a relationship between a dog and a dolphin. A scientist is trying to re-introduce a dolphin into the wild and until Zeus showed up was having no luck. My little girl has  watched it numerous times and loves it. There is comedy, romance and  suspense. For Vosloo fans he is very good in this movie. He plays a  scientist who doesn't have the dolphins best interest in mind, but as usual  he is the perfect villian and does a great job!",951091200,3,484,4.274725274725275
44303,5,0783111509,"""Zeus and Roxanne"" had quite a simple concept to it but it was the story that held its audience.  A dog capable of inter-species communication, in this case, it was a dolphin.  The dolphin, Roxanne, was  equally as pleased to see Zeus.  Their owners fall in love, only to  separate.  They are brought together by the team of Zeus and Roxanne.",913075200,2,342,4.524590163934426

44365,1,0783111509,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

Mary Beth Dunhill (Kathleen Quinlan) is a marine biologist working for a small oceanographic institute on the Florida Gulf Coast, struggling to get grant funding, working to return a formerly captive dolphin named Roxanne to the wild, and trying to raise two daughters, 15-year-old Judith (Majandra Delfino) and 12-year-old Nora (Jessica Howell).  When the Barnetts rent a cottage just across from the one the Dunhills are occupying and Zeus becomes fascinated with Roxanne on seeing her leaping and playing in the bay, it changes everyone's lives.  Terry is immediately attracted to Mary Beth, but the crazy circumstances of their meeting seem to mitigate against anything serious.  Then Zeus stows away abord Mary Beth's research boat and, to her astonishment, seems to initiate real interchange with Roxanne.  With some manipulation by the kids, Terry and Mary Beth begin to date--but Terry isn't sure he's over his wife's death.  It takes Zeus, once again, to bring things to their rightful conclusion.  Humor, animals, beautiful scenery, and a nasty-nice villain (Arnold Vosloo as Mary Beth's former supervisor Claude Carver)--what more do you need?  Kids will like them all, and adults will enjoy following the budding (but never overemphasized) romance.  In a way, it isn't just a dog and a dolphin who are learning to communicate: it's animals and humans, a man and a woman, a boy and two girls.  And, after all, communication is something everybody has to master.",1272326400,3,1663,5.2180451127819545

I didn't get my hopes up because let's face it, it was .05 cents.  But it was delivered in about a week in perfect condition and the DVD is good quality.  I am so happy and now my daughter can enjoy this movie for years to come.",1253145600,,390,3.7777777777777777

If you LOVED THE MOVIE ANDRE, YOU'LL LOVE THIS ONE AS WELL!!

Great family movie. Young kids, teenagers or adults will love this one.

Especially animal lovers.

Zeus and Roxanne are very well trained and are very TALENTED!

BOTH ARE HILARIOUS!  Especially when Zeus jumps in a boat and sits in the driver seat going down the highway and has both paws on the steering wheel the whole time.  Too Cute and funny.

You should purchase this one.  Love to watch it more than once.

10 stars from me.

Great family and animal movie...Glad they finally put it on DVD!",1169683200,,1110,4.381188118811881
44498,4,0783111509,What a refreshing family movie.  It is so hard to find real family movies without inappropriate adult moments.  This was truly a feel good movie that the whole family can watch together - with a great tropical setting.  We were cheering for the dog and the dolphin.,1155427200,,265,4.595744680851064
44499,5,0783111509,"The kids and I watch this movie over and over again.  It is a real feel good movie with a little bit of everything for everybody; romance, suspence, mystery, and of course, animals!",1152230400,,181,4.484848484848484
44500,5,0783111509,"Maybe because I love dogs and dophins and the beach and romance, this movie is a ""feel good"" always laugh and cry kind of thing for me. Yes it is corny, and yes it is formulaic, but I really enjoy watching it after a stressful day or when I need a complete detach from reality. Besides, the dog and the boy are too cute for words!",1010534400,5,330,4.015151515151516
