3915095,3,B002E01LVG,"This movie is beautifully made, visually stunning, thoughtful and inadvertently prescient -- its topic, a Canadian mass shooting from the '80s, presages our current epidemic.

I give it only 3 stars because the topic is depressing and the ending a little trite.",1483401600,,261,5.214285714285714

3915097,3,B002E01LVG,really interesting. smart move to film in BW so it didn't look like a gore horror film. very sad story that still hits home to this day as violence like this grows.,1441670400,,164,4.15625

3915099,4,B002E01LVG,"During the 2012 presidential election, the Left used tactics that I thought were beyond dirty pool:  the assertion of the Right's so-called ""War on Women.""  Naturally, this would be at least an implied and unfair ad hominem (not to mention severe overgeneralization), one that everyone should have rejected due to these logic issues alone.  But when it comes to love and war -- politics IS war, by the way, and don't forget it -- there are no rules, and so while the Right surely wasn't appreciative of the slam, I suppose that the Left wasn't completely stupid by using this tactic.  After all, it seemed to work.  The end does not justify the means, however, and it didn't in this case.

Of course, women's rights -- or lack, thereof -- have been discussed for far longer than just the last election, and I can see women's point, even if I am a man.  But I will assert that things have been carried too far; I'm all for women wanting equal rights, but with equal rights come equal responsibilities.  I have seen many women who seem to want it ""both ways,"" and many that want to have it better than men.  That's when I cry, ""Foul.""

And in this sense, I can also see the point of the antagonist portrayed in this film, but only to a point.  In a short segment early in the first act, he recites his manifesto (but only to the audience) which describes why he hates feminists and why they must die.  His position reminds me a bit of the one taken by Ted Kaczynski, in the sense that, while Mr. Kaczynski is beyond intelligent -- he is still alive in prison with an IQ over 170 -- he rationalized bad behavior that derived from that ""logic,"" which is always problematic.  It is ironic that Mr. Kaczynski used technology to counter the technology that he supposedly hated, which of course was a huge contradiction.  Here, the antagonist at least rationalizes bad behavior, but while using some valid reasoning behind it.  There are valid arguments, and there are sound arguments as well; but for an argument to have true merit, it must meet both.  It is the case that, if a valid argument arrives at an invalid conclusion, at least one premise must be faulty.  The antagonist surely failed somewhere along the line.

I didn't know much about this story before watching, and I have no idea how close it follows real events.  It is interesting though that this transpired almost exactly 10 years before Columbine.  If this is true, why was the ""Columbine Massacre"" so heavily covered, while this didn't seem to get even a blip in the US media?  Sure, it was in Canada, and sure, most US citizens don't seem to care much about news outside of their own borders.  But if this film is to be believed, I think that more people may have died in this incident than Columbine.

One reviewer on this site complained about this being filmed in black and white.  I disagree.  In particular, the outdoor scenes when it is snowing are quite beautiful.  Also, seeing blood only in black seems to be more powerful.  This film doesn't have an overabundance of dialog, and I liked that a lot; instead, the audience is required to feel how the actors feel mostly through movement and expression.  Furthermore, I actually really liked how some scenes were repeated at different points during the film, but seen through different actors' eyes, as then you are able to feel what's happening from different actors' perspectives.  I can't recall a film offhand that has used this technique before, and it was quite a brave and smart choice, since initially I will admit I was somewhat confused.  But not for long.

Well, even though the Left used the ""War on Women"" to their advantage during the last election, I think that they trivialized the subject in reality, making it difficult for those later that have a valid complaint.  If you want to see a true ""War on Women,"" watch ""Polytechnique"" instead.  You might gain a better perspective -- or better yet, perspectives -- on what really might be going on.",1426204800,2,3982,4.610795454545454
3915100,3,B002E01LVG,Black and white was unnecessary. Depressing movie.,1419811200,,50,6.285714285714286
3915101,5,B002E01LVG,"Viewers know this is based on a true story about a shooter in a college.  We've all read about these terrible events, but as the film begins we know we're going to be a spectator to it happening.

Perhaps we want to see, because we could very well be confronted with this terror in a shopping mall, restaurant or any public place and we want to imagine that we might survive, as some did in this movie, by doing the smallest of things that mean the difference between life and death.

Excellent cinematography, acting and directing.  Truly a ""must see"".",1406592000,2,553,4.5
3915102,5,B002E01LVG,"I remember all too well the tragedy in Canada; l was horrified that a fellow classmate would want to kill others in a hard science environment simply based on being female.

The movie captured the setup well by using flashbacks; the scenes with the killer were as creepy and believable as a standard ""major motion picture"" villain, which made the banality of evil in this mass murder even more terrifying. The small scene where one of the female characters is hit with an inappropriate (and actionable) gender-biased question on an interview for an internship, showing that sexism was still openly pervasive in the workplace in the 1980's - back-to-back with a scene where the killer describes all of the ""advantages"" women have over men - was especially ironic and disturbing.

Writing, acting, directing...all were fantastic, for a film covering such a difficult subject. One of the best films I've ever seen in this genre. Watch it - it is well worth the time, given how many school shootings now occur.",1402790400,10,1006,4.911764705882353
3915103,3,B002E01LVG,"Evelyne Brochu - While her role is subtle, and words few, it is her ability to use her eyes and expressions to convey the characters feelings. She is such a pro at this!

8366635,3,B002E01LVG,Can't endorse this work of fiction.  The personal life details are made up and the black and white doesn't work for me.,1526256000,,119,4.409090909090909
8366636,5,B002E01LVG,"This movie didn't use any cheap techniques to draw the viewer in, it relied on the simple horror of the story.

8366637,1,B002E01LVG,"I'd rate this zero stars, if possible, for lack of accessibility to those of us who are Hard of Hearing and d/Deaf. I'd been eager to see this and have a clue what dialogue occurred... but no.
That being said, rating any production poorly because you don't like the genre, or because the story being chronicled is depressing - ya think? - is nonsense. Gees.",1516838400,,357,4.507692307692308
8366638,3,B002E01LVG,"Suffers from a disjointed telling of the horror that happened.  Clearly the filmmakers are struggling to drag this story out to feature length, which they admit is fiction in the case of the personal details of the victims.  Tragically, there really isn't much to say here.  Its just the chronicle of the slaughter of other human beings by a madman.  Its hard to find anything redeeming in the retelling of this story.",1515974400,5,418,4.763888888888889
8366639,5,B002E01LVG,"I re-watch this movie every year on December 6th and it makes me cry every year. I am a female engineer, and when I was in university, we watched this to remember the women who were murdered. I will always remember them and this film helps remind us of what happened to them and what struggles women still face today. This film is very respectfully done and the emotional impact is powerful. 14 never forgotten.",1512518400,,411,4.493333333333333
8366640,4,B002E01LVG,"The filmmakers were very sensitive when they made this movie, the shooter was never named and they shot it in black and white to lessen the bloodlines of this film. My main concern with the movie is they tried to be too gentle. We did not see a character development of the shooter fair enough,  but I didn't see an character development with the victims either,  so I was left knowing nothing much about anyone. Really just knowing the time, place and what happened in what order.

Mass murderers have one thing in common, mental illness it is really that simple. Confiscating guns will not stop murderers and criminals from getting guns, if only one other person had been been armed that day they could have stopped the shooter's mudering mayhem.

Spoiler: I did some research to understand this story.
The shooter was the product of a Canadian nurse (once a catholic nun) and a muslim Algerian businessman . The father was abusive, to his wife and children. He also had affairs and despised women. The parents separated when the shooter was seven and they divorced five years later.  The shooter changed his name when he was fourteen because he passionately hated his father.

The shooter constantly was fired from jobs because of his bad attitude. He  suffered from low self esteem and chronic acne, he was a loner and anti social. He was also found unsuitable mentally by the Canadian forces when he applied. He would fly into rages when frustrated and his behavior was unpredictable.

He believed woman should stay at  home and take care of their families and complained that women were taking men's jobs. After the mass killings a Police psychiatrist noted from his writings; an extreme narcissistic personality disorder with the shooter having high levels of self criticism and difficulties dealing with rejection and failure. Feelings of powerlessness and incompetence were compensated by a violent and grandiose imaginary life.  Classic mass shooter profile.

These type of problems and personality traits are obvious in some of todays young college students, expect more of the sort of behavior, when they don't get their own way.  Basically if a kid isn't a go getter, good looking, super smart or athletic and the world doesn't notice their importance, they hate the world and everyone in it , and they want to punish those who they PERCEIVE are better or luckier than them, so sad but true. Everyone should live their lives to be the best they can be with what they have and most of the world is very ordinary.",1512518400,7,2524,4.830626450116009

8366642,5,B002E01LVG,"This film captures the essence of one man's sickness transforming the lives of innocents into tragedies, and should be required viewing for every member of any society tolerating over-abundant access to weapons. The demonstration is very real, and very fair.  Artistically, the acting, direction and cinematography cannot be praised enough. Created in memory of the 1989 event, this work becomes more relevant with every headline.",1508284800,,430,5.615384615384615
8366643,4,B002E01LVG,"My look into Villenueve's film centered upon the recognition of his science-fiction film ""Arrival"". So, I decided to see ""Polytechnique""  first. Then, I wanted to watch ""Sicario"", ""Incendies""  before ""Arrival"" If I wanted to connect this film to another, I would suggest ""Arrival."" Why?
Because ""Polytechnique"" is b-w. The most significant parts of ""Arrival"" are also b-w. Seeing how Villenueve dealt with these two inatances was a fascinating view of the filmmakers' art.  The star ratings are silly. Four stars means ""I like it.""  In this case, I would have to say ""I appreciate it.""

Shot in documentary style, the film looks at the famous school shootings in Canada.",1490572800,,670,5.110091743119266
