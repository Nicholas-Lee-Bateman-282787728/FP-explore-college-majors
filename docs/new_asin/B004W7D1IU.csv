8444727,5,B004W7D1IU,"This is a good intro to Funk guitar. It is however, more of an 'Essentials' than 'Ultimate' technique DVD. The examples given will build your repetoire and give you all the basic techniques. There are examples in the style of James Brown, Niles Rogers era Chic, Earth Wind and Fire and Chaka Khan. Stuart Bull, the instructor, also shows how these classic examples are built out of two and sometimes three separate rhythm parts, which is an important topic if you want to write your own Funk tunes. There is no tab but the examples are clearly demonstrated and explained. I was hoping for more examples but for the price it's still a good DVD. If you want to get into Funk, add to your Funk bag of tricks or just want to get more of the Funk percussive rhythm style in your playing this is a worthwhile investment.",1423785600,,814,4.469798657718121
