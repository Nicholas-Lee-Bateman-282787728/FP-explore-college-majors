In CRAZY CHICKS: SOAKING WET they've got about half a dozen girls, probably all in their late teens, with most of them at a swimming pool, and one of them beside a river. It's almost all posing, although I wish they had done more ""natural"" activities like swimming, pool games, and the like. The girls are nice-looking enough, though some are not great at posing. But what ruins it all is the camerawork, which is mostly inept. Usually, the camera operators seem uncertain what to do, and so they keep zooming in and out and moving the camera around, and are shaky in the process. Have they ever heard of a tripod??

Occasionally, the camerawork gets better. Still, thanks to the sexy girls, this DVD is pretty enjoyable to watch, but this should have been much better.
