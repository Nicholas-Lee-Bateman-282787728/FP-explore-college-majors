8550435,1,B00AEFGS3Y,"After returning the first defective video, I ordered another from a different distributor which was worse!  It was in English but contained annoying Korean subtitles throughout.  Also, the sound was so low that it was barely audible even with the volume on full.  Amazon was very generous and gave a full refund, but stay away from this if you don't want the hassle.",1401926400,3,366,4.777777777777778
8550436,4,B00AEFGS3Y,"This is my favorite play. It's deceptive because on a first viewing, you will miss the care and level of detail both Ibsen and the director have included. The film quality and lighting are excellent. The acting is superb. The only fault I've found is sometimes the volume is very low on some devices. I purchased this to show to my student in class after we read this play, and in some classrooms we could barely hear the dialogue at all. However, I assume that's due to the film's age.",1386115200,7,486,4.411111111111111
