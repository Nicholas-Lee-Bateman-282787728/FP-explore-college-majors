7843965,3,6303333060,"Over a photo still of Egan and Saul from the previous Stranger installment, The Terror Game, runs the following caption:  ""They are terrorists from another dimension.  They have completed their mission on Earth & now want to leave.  But they are trapped--& they are desperate.""  However, in the background, is the Stranger, who knows the dimensional portkeys through which they can escape.  The fact that Saul and Egan are still on Earth means that so is Solomon--the Stranger's real name--and they need to find him.
To that end, Saul and Egan pose as police investigators looking into the botched handling of an arrest conducted by Detective Chief Inspector Diana Sellars of the Nottingham Central Police Station.  Saul, ever the libertine and with an obnoxious smirk on his face, has been using his charms to get close to a policewoman, Saundra Hawkins, in charge of the files, to see if he can find Solomon.  Sellars is a dedicated but no-nonsense and as it turns out, reasonable police officer.  She is investigating the disappearance of two nightclub employees, Tamora Hennessy and Norman Turner (q.v. The Terror Game for their role and fates) but there's more to the nightclub revealed here.
Meanwhile, Solomon has finally found peace.  Weary of being a terrorist, he has settled in with Rose Neal, an ex-con who's made a fresh start by editing and publishing The Local, a magazine whose subscriptions have been going up and a BBC TV interview would really put her in the spotlight.  Solomon is contributing pieces to her magazine and the two seem very attached to each other, although both are reluctant to discuss their pasts.
Several things happen that cause the inevitable collision.  Egan and Saul run into Rose, with the latter harassing her.  She is very upset at this and files a complaint at Sellars' precinct.  She also takes photos of Egan and Saul, which Solomon later sees.  And then, the nightclub from The Terror Game, which is also a front for a porno video ring, is raided, with porn and security camera videos taken.  And guess who happens to be on one of the sec. camera videos?
Caroline John (Sellars) is the only Dr. Who alumnus other than Colin Baker (Solomon) to appear, as she played Liz Shaw during the 1970 season of the series.  Her tough no-nonsense character is quite able to confront the smirking Saul and brutish Egan and even put them in their place.  Holly King is appealing as Rose, and a wonderful counterpart for Baker's Solomon.  Nicholas Briggs, who wrote and starred in the Stranger episode In Memory Alone, plays Evans, Sellars' number two man.
This seems to tie up the chain of events begun in The Terror Game, and it's nice to see Solomon find some peace, even if for a while.  Nobody gets killed in this story unlike the previous one.  The series would end with Eye Of The Beholder.",1072915200,,2831,4.7860082304526745
7843966,3,6303333060,"This is another chapter in the direct-to-video chronicles of the Stranger, played by Colin Baker, the sixth actor to play the title character in the British television series ""Doctor Who"".  It features characters and situations introduced in a previous video, ""The Terror Game"", and leads directly into a sequel, ""Eye of the Beholder""...it does not stand on its own very well.
David Troughton and John Wadmore are featured in all three stories as terrorists from another dimension, Saul and Egan.  Here they have completed their mission on Earth and are ready to leave.  Only the Stranger can help them, but he is hiding from his violent past and his association with them.
This does not resemble Doctor Who very much, featuring profanity and even brief nudity, although nothing that would seem out of place on any BBC police drama you might run across on PBS.  Caroline John, another Doctor Who player, makes a fine police chief.  Although I have no complaints about this volume, there is little to recommend it unless you are interested in the entire saga.",1052006400,,1058,4.921348314606742
