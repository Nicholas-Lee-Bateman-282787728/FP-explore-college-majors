7597295,5,B01ABUYAKO,"Do the math, if desire NEW DVDs, buy the three seasons here and only pennies more than buying them individually at the present time, labeled as series units of Line of Duty, produced by Acorn in the US/Canada Reg 1 form. Saving money by using marketplace vendors could be iffy, as the UK has their own PAL version, Region 2, which will not play on regular DVD units in America. Regardless of how you watch, DVD or streaming, you will find it addicting and powerful. Each series has several episodes but one leads directly into the next. You will be glad you don't have to wait a week between episodes. Its hard NOT to binge watch on this show.

AC-12 (Anti-corruption unit) fights against dirty cops. As in reality, only a small part of the force is bent and bad. Keeley Hawes appears in sets 2-3, while boss DS Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), DC Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), and DS Arnott (Martin Compston Monarch of the Glen) comprise the AC-12 team primaries. High suspense, and extremely fine acting by a seasoned cast of regulars and guests. Complex plot, sub-plots, and characters maintain edge-of-the-seat scary for hours and keep you guessing.",1504656000,,1150,4.75
7597296,5,B01ABUYAKO,Well written and well acted.  Lots of twists and turns in the plots.,1503187200,,68,4.230769230769231
7597297,5,B01ABUYAKO,"This British series about an internal affairs department (they call it ""anti-corruption"" over there) is one of the best cop shows anywhere. While the squad members of unit AC-12 remain mostly the same, each season they address a new case of police corruption. The storylines are very smart and will keep you guessing *and* on the edge of your seat. British shows tend to have short seasons -- usually six episodes -- but Line of Duty packs so much into each six-episode arc that it actually feels longer. Season Four was shown on British TV in 2017, and more seasons are planned. I can't wait!",1501632000,,593,4.6571428571428575
7597298,4,B01ABUYAKO,"Only watched season 1 as of this review, but the characters were compelling and there were enough surprises to make it well worth watching.",1501372800,,139,4.833333333333333

7597301,5,B01ABUYAKO,"Great series. Dramatic series involving AC-12 (Anti-Corruption Unit 12) and their challenges of investigating their fellow British police officers.

Can't wait for the next seasons.

Excellent delivery service.",1494115200,,210,6.464285714285714

8746971,5,B01ABUYAKO,"This has become my favorite of the UK Police Dramas.  The series centers around a specialized group of anti-corruption police who, obviously, investigate suspicious police who may be corrupt.  The first series centers (and the guest star gets top billing) of a successful DCI with incredible close rates for his station.  However, despite those seemingly out of sorts records leads to another story of a much more complex crime and crimes in the city.

Excellent portrayal as the cop under suspicion by Lennie James as the DCI who winds up in the investigation.  The second has to do with an armed response team, and a shooting, excellently played by Daniel Mays.  My favorite is Keeley Hawes as Lindsay Denton (Season 3), who while helping, by request of a local police station, to move a protected witness then gets dragged into a horrific story line.  Her portrayal as the smart, sharp DI who has been overlooked by her superiors is impressive.  I believe she won an award, as did Lennie James (Season 1) and Daniel Mays (Season 2).  It is that good that the temporary star gets top billing.

Last, Martin Compston, Vicky McClure, Andrian Dunbar, and Craig Parkinson play the team investigators, with other supporting staff.  The support staff are also excellent, as are the upper police brass characters who work at odds with the team because nothing is ever simple or easy with people looking over your shoulder.

All three series have a continuity thread through them, though they are entirely separate stories, separate investigations with separate star/protagonists.  Excellently done to write separate stores with the most subtle of continuity for the viewer.

A final shout-out to Jed Mercurio to write these series and keep it all straight so that the viewer does not get lost.  But not so simple that a viewer will find the scripts to be simplistic.  These are not simple cases.  Highly, highly recommended.",1524614400,,1919,4.9655172413793105
8746972,5,B01ABUYAKO,Great show - very exciting!  Looking forward to Season Five.....,1522886400,,64,5.4
8746973,5,B01ABUYAKO,"this is a great british mystery series, if you love british tv be sure to check this out. the story line and characters are very believable and the action kept me on the edge of my seat. i must admit that series 3 was my favorite so far but i enjoyed each series over all. good show!!",1509408000,,284,4.0
8746974,5,B01ABUYAKO,"I was in an accident, requiring me to have several weeks off work, and unable to drive. My family is British, & my mum recommended this to me from her own TV viewing. It only cost $10 more for me to receive the third season than for the first two, so I went ahead and ordered. I have Prime, so the set arrived within a couple of days, packaging intact. I have watched the first 3 episodes ( basically the first disc) of the first season, and I can see why it was so highly recommended. I'm really enjoying it so far and, provided the quality of the other seasons matches the first, I will likely order the 4th season too.",1507852800,,621,4.140495867768595
8746975,5,B01ABUYAKO,Very intense.  Lots of twists and turns.,1506816000,,40,4.714285714285714
8746976,5,B01ABUYAKO,"Each series consists of a single six part story, but most of the characters carry into each story/series. So each series is equal in length to three feature films. Very intense with a fair amount of violence. Unlike most 'cop' shows, these stories are about corruption by police, and those assigned to ferret it out. Great stories, well written and acted. Just received the 4th series. I don't want to describe the individual series so a not to spoil.",1506384000,,451,4.7215189873417724
8746977,5,B01ABUYAKO,"This is on-the-edge of your seat TV. Every episode is jammed packed full of stuff and always a ""I did not see that coming!"" moment. Every season gets better and better. I can't stop watching thus show!  Best. TV. Show. Ever. Created!  I hope it goes on for years. It's a shame American TV is so pitiful in comparison. Watch one episode and you will be hooked.",1505779200,,359,4.343283582089552
8746978,5,B01ABUYAKO,"I really, really like this BBC show. I have watched all 4 seasons and each one is unique in its story line which is held together really well. The main characters are all equally strong. If you like police shows this is one for you.",1505433600,,232,4.177777777777778
