3850157,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"An opportunity to spend 80 minutes with 2 amazing dancers (now in their 70's) who are still active and creative.  It is a documentary about their love for each other and strong marriage just as much as it is about their professional successes.  Geoffrey Holder, in particular, is also the most incredible costume designer, and seeing his sketches and Broadway costumes is a treat.",1246233600,,380,4.921875
3850158,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"Two superb dancers at their peak. I can watch this DVD over and over again. when Geoffrey Holder died this past year, we lost a giant.",1433721600,,134,4.1923076923076925
3850159,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"To watch this documentary is to experience sheer pleasure.  Carmen Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder are beautiful, talented and as I knew they would be, really good people...generous of spirit and truly kind.

3850165,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"This is a wonderful film about Holder, his wife Carmen and a great deal about Alvin Alley's dance troupe as well.  I totally recommend this film for all who really love modern dance. What a loss to lose Mr. Holder, such a good long life though!",1423699200,,244,4.304347826086956
3850166,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"I didn't know much about Geoffrey Holder's life as a dancer (or painter), I just knew him as an actor and great voice.  When he passed away and I read his obituary I became interested in learning more about him.  He and his wife Carmen de Lavallade were wonderful dancers and their life together was a great partnership.  Although I wish this documentary mentioned the dates of old videos more often, I still found it excellent!",1415404800,,428,4.605263157894737

3850169,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"My wife and I had attended a viewing of this film at an art festival and when we found it on amazon we had to have it. The film brings out areas and facts of Carmen and Geoffery's careers that I had no knowledge of and would only be known to people directly involved with all areas of the dance, theater, and art industries. It is an illuminating documentary of two magnificent, talented and magnetic artists.",1370476800,,409,4.394736842105263
3850170,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"Wonderfully funny, warm, ultimately moving and inspiring story of the 50 year marriage
of dancers and choreographers Geoffrey Holder and Carmen De Lavallade.

It covers their personal lives and how that intertwined with their considerable impact on American
and world dance. Geoffrey has seemingly endless talents --painter, author, costume designer,
director, and Carmen has seemingly endless youth.  At 71 she still is a magnificent, flowing dancer.

A celebration of love, and creativity walking hand in hand.

My only very minor quibble is I wish some of the dancing clips were longer.  At just
82 minutes the film could have easily allowed us to enjoy their sublime work a few minutes more.",1308873600,5,695,5.225225225225225
3850171,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"Most people remember Geoffrey Holder as the 7UP Un-Cola man, or from Live and Let Die, Annie or Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, but he and Carmen DeLavallade have been trendsetters for more than 50 years in the worlds of dance, theatre and art. This docu has some sexy, romantic vintage clips of their amazing work, and is a great tribute to these living legends. Highly recommend for dance fans and for young dancers interested in learning about the masters (Carmen was the co-founder of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company with Alvin).",1302220800,,532,4.793478260869565
3850172,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"This DVD is very eye opening.  There was so much I didn't know.  This is a great resource for dancers, dance educators, and dance historians.  The dancing is great, but I wish there were more pieces I could use to show K-8 in class.  I am appreciative that this was made.",1270857600,,271,4.254901960784314
3850173,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"These two talented artistes make history on their own as well as in tandem.  Each is so gifted yet they succeed as a married couple. as parents of a talented son, and as multi-talents in many fields.  They constitute living history, especially for so many young people who think that ""Rap"" and FOX network dramas are what Afro-Americans are all about.  This should be required viewing for high school and college classes in the arts...drama, dramatics, fashion, dance,staging. set design and construction, costuming,writing....you name it, Carmen and Geoffrey have done and are still doing it !!  In addition, they are iving proof that aging is not synonymous with retiring to the easy chair and giving up the pursuit of artistic endeavors.  Where else and how else can you revel in memories of the past while indulging in current pursuits by this astonishing couple ?  If I wear out my DVD, I'll just have to order another one !",1269129600,,929,4.848101265822785

3850176,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"I didn't get a chance to see this docu when it played for a week in one of Denver's art house theatres, and I couldn't find it in any of my local video stores for rental.  I decided to ""bite the bullet"" as it were and order it.  I'm very happy to say I wasn't disappointed.  I've been familiar with their contributions to the arts (Geoffrey is truly a renaissance man!) as I grew up, but this film also made me aware of some things that I hadn't known about each.  I recommend it to fans of Carmen de Lavalade and Geoffrey Holder!!",1254787200,5,531,4.12621359223301
3850177,4,B0025Z4Q4O,"Carmen De Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder are a husband-and-wife dance team that became an instrumental force in the modern dance movement of the mid to late 20th Century.  Carmen made her name both as a choreographer and a dancer, while Geoffrey did the same, adding painter, set designer and costume designer to his list of accomplishments. In fact, he choreographed the original Broadway production of ""The Wiz"" - and one of the highlights of the documentary ""Carmen and Geoffrey"" is a clip of Geoffrey receiving the Tony Award as Best Director for that play from none other than the original scarecrow himself, Ray Bolger.  Now, well past their physical primes but still overflowing with vision and vigor, Carmen and Geoffrey impart their wisdom and talents to a whole new generation of dancers just arriving on the scene.

Directed by Linda Atkinson and Nick Dood, ""Carmen and Geoffrey"" is an informative and loving tribute to these icons of modern dance.  The movie begins when Carmen and Geoffrey were mere youths themselves, burning with an unquenchable desire to express themselves through dance.  It chronicles the early years before they met, he a dyslexic child growing up in Trinidad and she a student of ballet in 1940s Los Angeles.  When they did finally discover one another - in the production of Harold Arlen's ""House of Flowers"" - it was love at first sight.  And the rest, as they say, is history.

Luckily for us, Carmen and Geoffrey are still alive and well and as eloquent, open-hearted and gregarious as ever.  We get to hear the story of their careers and lives - and of their nearly half-century-long love affair - in their own words.  We also learn quite a bit about the history of modern interpretive dance - particularly as it relates to the African American influence - through the chronicling of their experiences.  Priceless clips from the past are combined with contemporary dance performances, making for a rich and satisfying experience for lovers of dance - and of the two individuals who did so much to define and refine it.",1249516800,12,2059,4.887931034482759
8351474,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"Absolutely brilliant.  I have watched this at least five times and shared it with my friends.  If you are at all interested in
the arts, particularly dance, give yourself a treat and watch the story of two individuals whose lifework is an inspiration to
all.  It happens they were also married partners in life and their personal relationship is heartwarming to experience.",1505692800,,373,4.983870967741935
8351475,4,B0025Z4Q4O,"I liked watching this video, informative. I guess that I was looking for a little more to his story that I didn't get, maybe because it was what it was.",1505088000,,152,4.1
8351476,5,B0025Z4Q4O,"This is a piece of dance history and should certainly be seen by every dancer. Carmen and Geoffrey are two dance icons that paved the way for so much that came after and they paved it with beauty, ultimate esthetics, talent and intelligence.
