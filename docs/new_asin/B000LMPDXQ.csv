2710364,2,B000LMPDXQ,"With the explosion of the superhero genre of recent years due to the various successes of the 'Spiderman' and 'X-Men' franchises and the recent additions of ""Superman Returns"" and ""Batman Begins"", movie studios around Hollywood are finding themselves trying to capitalize on the recent craze with either adaptations of existing comic book material or original content.  For the most part the studios have been successful with their adaptations of various existing comic book characters, sadly the original creations are not faring as well.  Disney learned this the hard way (in my opinion) with the lackluster, kid-friendly, tongue firmly planted in cheek, superhero comedy ""Sky High"" starring Kurt Russell a couple of years ago.  I thought the movie was a pathetic attempt by Disney to cash in on the superhero genre, appearing to disregard what made the previous comic book movies successes (ie. a respect for the core audience, blending reality with fantasy, and plenty of action and drama with some humor thrown in at times), what Disney made was a slapstick comedy filled with sight-gags and essentially just poking fun at the genre.  This choice would have been fine if it would have been properly executed.  Come forward a couple of years and Sony Pictures is attempting to correct Disney's mistakes and make a superhero movie work with an original team not based on any existing characters.  The movie was the Tim Allen action/comedy vehicle, ""Zoom:  Academy For Superheroes""; the result was a movie that was somewhat better than it's predecessor ""Sky High"", but still nothing to watch twice, and I'll talk more about that later on, for now, I'll move on to my story synopsis for the movie.

Bright colors and simple stories of classic, campy superhero comics are the template for ""Zoom: Academy For Superheroes"".  Gone is dramatic, realistic storytelling that comprises most recent superhero movies. The story begins with retired superhero Captain Zoom (Tim Allen) getting pulled out of his dead-end job where he's chosen to hide since disappearing from the media spotlight, when the government decides to assemble a new team of super-powered kids to thwart an impending disaster. The motley quartet includes a herculean little girl, an invisible slacker, a telekinetic hot chick, and a chunky lad whose body inflates to enormous size.  Now, Zoom, a has-been of a superhero, must rediscover the power within that he's long forgotten and lead an an all-new generation of superheroes to save the world.

This movie had potential, by choosing to not base the story on an existing comic book, Sony Pictures were provided with an opportunity to create their own universe and superhero mythology where anything was possible.  To accomplish this, all they would have had to do was take things more seriously, a little humor here and there would have been ok, but not every other scene.  Especially when the humor was one sight-gag after the other, and some of them repetitive.  I mean, throw in a joke that's actually funny and aimed a little higher than the level of a 5 year old, just do something to break up the monotony.  The special effects were a mixed bag of good and bad CGI.  There were times that they were impressive to see, and others where it was painful to watch, and made me wonder if I had switched from watching an actual theatrical release to wathcing a B-movie, made for the Sci-Fi channel.  This hodge-podge of CGI assisted in the hampering of some of the attempts at humor on the filmmaker's part because some of the gags relied on the kids learning their individual powers, therefore requiring CGI.  When the CGI is lacking in quality, the gag, no matter how good it might have been, will suffer.

The casting was alright, the choice to use Tim Allen as the has-been superhero was a pretty clear indication that Sony was not attempting to make a serious movie, but I still held out hope that there would be more drama which would make the movie feel more balanced and entertaining to adults as well as children, something like Tim Allen's previous sci-fi work in the action/comedy ""Galaxy Quest"".  The kid/teenage actors that comprised the rest of the superhero team were adequate in their respective roles, though their character arcs were predictable the moment they were introduced, no surprise there.  The rest of the supporting cast was comprised of good actors, who like Tim Allen, must have signed on to just collect a paycheck, because this movie will do nothing for their careers or self-respect.  Out of the entire cast, Chevy Chase offered the most laughs (and even they were few and far between), but his appearance felt like a last-ditch effort by an aging and out-of-touch comedian to find a new audience and be relevant again.  Sorry, Chevy no such luck of a career resurgence with this flop of a movie.

As I said earlier, ""Zoom: Academy For Superheroes"" was better than Disney's ""Sky High"", but still nowhere near the quality of comic book movie as ""X-Men"" or ""Superman Returns"", and if it was merely trying to be a spoof, there have been far better efforts at spoofing movies, the 'Scary Movie' franchise is a prime example of a spoofing success story.  Now, please understand if you have a young child in your family they probably will find this movie incredibly entertaining and will want to see it again and again, but otherwise no one else will find much joy from the experience.

""Zoom: Academy For Superheroes"" is rated PG for fantasy violence.",1171324800,4,5493,4.9049676025917925
2710365,4,B000LMPDXQ,I saw Zoom with my husband and 5-year-old daughter and we loved it.  Nothing offensive (except one child 'auditioning' his particular nasal-based superpower early on -- truly gross).  This movie was great fun - as we left the theater we all commented on how much we liked it and made references to it for several days afterward.  See this movie with the whole family!,1171238400,7,367,4.703125
2710366,1,B000LMPDXQ,"I've worked in he field of home video for over 20 years, and I thought that I had seen the worst when Bloodrayne came out.

I was wrong.

Zoom is far worse..........why does Hollywood continually put out movies that are cross-bastardizations of other more successful films? ""It's The Incredibles meets X-Men meets Sky High meets Galaxy Quest meets Fantastic Four meets The Santa Clause meets You Can't Do That On Television.""

All I can figure is that Tim, Rip, Courteney and Chevy needed the money, or that they signed on before the final script was drafted, and didn't want to back out and risk a lawsuit, a la Kim Basinger and Boxing Helena........

Just bad, that's about all I can say..........

Anyone else remember when Chevy Chase was funny? A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away?",1171065600,9,793,4.676258992805756
2710367,1,B000LMPDXQ,"I didn't expect much out of this movie going in but man, this movie was absolutely retarded.  I figured at best this would be a fun dumb comedy like Tim Allen's former ""Galaxy Quest"", wrong.  Allen has stooped to a new low, efficiently placing the long over due last nail in the coffin of his career.  He's just got this sleazy burnt out attitude through out the entire film.  Courtney Cox also gives a less than steller performance (Has she got so much ""Friends"" cash rolling in that she just doesn't even try any more?).  Chevy Chase was kinda funny, but it's a shame, this being his first major role in a while, that this is the best he can get.  Granted this is intended to be a family film, but I can't see this movie entertaining anyone over the age of 6(definately not fun for the whole family).  The problem is that this movie has been not only done before, but done much better with last years ""Sky High"".  The part of the movie that just made it mind gratingly intolerable was the horrible teeny bopper pop/punk soundtrack blaring throughout the film (Do even our kids wanna listen to ""Smash Mouth"" anymore?  Do people really listen to this crap?).  I really tried to enjoy this movie, but I just really, really, really really didn't.  You might be able to entertain your little, little kids for 90 minutes by popping this one on, but be forewarned you'll be ready to choke on a bullet after about 5 minutes.  This movie is just plain dumb, a complete waste of life.",1169769600,11,1476,4.446096654275093
2710368,5,B000LMPDXQ,"I saw this movie with my son & we both enjoyed it thoroughly. I am a Tim Allen fan & enjoy his charming, light-hearted humor.  I was not disappointed with this movie.  It's a wonderful family film & as soon as it becomes available on DVD, will be a wonderful addition to our collection.  Enjoy.",1157846400,19,294,4.3090909090909095
2710369,3,B000LMPDXQ,"Jack was doing alright in retirement, looking a little haggard in his menial job until a gorgeous woman wearing a frilly green dress gets him involved in a game that only Captain Zoom can accomplish.  Chevy Chase as Grant and Rip Torn as Larraby waylay ""Jack"" and force him to train a new team of super-heroes for a special mission.  They come in all sizes, ages and with the special super powers needed for this top secret task.

I predict that Michael Cassidy will be a big star soon with Kevin Zagers, who played Conner, will follow in his footsteps.  They were the shining stars in this adaptation of the comic book stories.  There will be no frivolity allowed with the two girls, six year old Cindy and the teen who knows things.  They are dubbed Princess and Wonder.  Michael is Houdini who falls for Wonder, and Mega Boy is the most wondrous of them all.  They were termed by their peers as misfits and weirdos.  Dylan (Houdini) is the typical rebellious teenager who is almost a genius -- and we all know that they don't fit into today's education system at all.

Jack's number one fan appears to have an inner ear problem, as she falls a lot.  Little Cindy loves to wear costumes like Cher, only hers are more juvenile.  She's a knockout in the Hawaiian outfit, the pink poodle, and ballerina (like Kaleena).  She soon learns the truth about her hero, that he has feet of clay and only cares about himself.  Jack tells the young crew he is training them to be a team, that he is so sorry, truly, for putting them in danger.  He has learned the reason for the mission -- to trap his brother Conner who had turned to the Dark Side.  Wow, his super powers were on a bigger scale than Zoom's.  Kevin Zeger was quite fantastic with the changeable color of eyes he has during his super powers.  He hadn't aged a bit, contrary to his brother Jack.

We all need someone to care, and this young group learned to feel as a family as they mastered their individual skills and melded into a real super-hero team.  You must see the flying saucer at the Wendy's drive-thru, used I suppose to get them over the slump of the finger in the chili.  There was a full moon as they landed in the desert where the lab was underground beneath large rocky cliffs.  I found the outdoor simulation disgusting, but I don't like bathroom humor.  As they reach their potential and work to right the wrong, they have learned to follow their instincts and trust each other and their leader, Jack,(Tim Allen) who fully realizes that he has not lost his powers either.  Is this our only option?  The dark side has more strength as Conner arrived in a whirlpool of evil from which they were able to extract him.  I hope you are not disappointed.  The song, ""It's Not Easy To Be Me,"" would have been alright except for the bad voice singing it.  After they rescued the 'good' Conner, Jack's brother and not the evil super-power, everyone was happy.  They were just having fun, but can I ever get over the insults.  Things got back to normal, and the foursome go their separate ways with their dreams realized.",1155340800,5,3083,4.463327370304114
2710370,4,B000LMPDXQ,"This is a SPOILERS-plagued review.

When the world is once again placed in imminent peril, General Larraby (Rip Torn), the head of a military secret ops, is forced to reactivate Project Zenith, a program meant to bring up to speed a new generation of superheroes. Tim Allen plays Jack Shepherd (aka Captain Zoom), an out of shape, cynical, ex-costumed crimefighter who hasn't fought crime in 30 years. You see, Zoom, as a youngster, was a member of the Zenith Team, along with his older brother Connor, aka Concussion. Larraby, whose military arm funded the supergroup, decided to boost the members' powers by exposing them to gamma radiation. I guess he wasn't taking Bruce Banner's phone calls that week, because these gamma ray things never, ever work. Zoom ended up losing his powers and Concussion turned evil and killed off the rest of the Zenith Team. Concussion, at last, was sent packing to another dimension, where he still waits to return to wreak more devastation.

The movie properly begins 30 years later, as Jack Shepherd is recalled to work and is given the task of teaching at a superhero academy/military facility (Area 52). There, he must mentor and develop a group of raw, hapless kids into a cohesive batch of heroes. The prospective team consists of Summer (Kate Mara), a very unpopular high school 16 year old, who has telekinetic powers; Cindy (Ryan Newman), a cute 6-year-old girl with super strength; Dylan, a a 17 year old (Michael Cassidy) who becomes invisible; and Tucker (Spencer Breslin), a 12-year-old chubby kid who can expand any part of his anatomy. Jack, at first, is very reluctant about training this band of misfits but, in due course, has a change of heart and begins to take his job seriously. Over time, Jack regains his superspeed ability and becomes the team's field commander. Together, with the help of geeky but lovely head researcher Marsha Halloway (Courtney Cox-Arquette), who has a secret of her own, this band of misfits must come together and thwart the worrisome return of Jack's evil brother, Concussion.

Based on the graphic novel ""Zoom's Academy for the Super Gifted"" from Jason Lethcoe, the film is adapted by Adam Rifkin (Mousehunt, Small Soldiers, and the upcoming Underdog and He-Man projects), re-written by Jordan Roberts (March of the Penguins, narration credits) and helmed by Pete Hewitt (Garfield and the very good Princess of Thieves, starring Kiera Knightley). Zoom was supposed to have been released earlier on May 12, two weeks before the theatre release of X-Men: The Last Stand. But 20th Century Fox and Marvel Comics filed suit against the Sony/Revolution Studios, accusing them of copycatting and piggy-backing the Marvel franchise.

How does the movie differ from the book? Well, Zoom has been tweaked a bit for cinema consumption, and I think for the worse. Gone is the main focal point of the book, which is main character Summer's feelings of isolation and alienation and how it turns around for her with her entry into Zoom's Academy, as she becomes empowered. Here, she is just one of the gang, without a chance to really wallow in teenage angst, as the focus shifts to Tim Allen's character. And gone, for now (dunno if there's gonna be a sequel), is the Academy's nemesis, the Grave's School for the Villainous Arts, as the film half-heartedly resorts to Concussion as the main heavy.

I'm not gonna kid ya, this isn't as good as the Incredibles; but very few films in this genre could be. Zoom isn't even as good as  Sky High or Spy Kids, who at least took the premise seriously. Zoom plays it for pre-teen laughs all the way, falling back on kid characters such as the Snot Kid or Jupiter, the Gas Giant (guess his super power) for high hilarity.

Having done Galaxy Quest, Santa Clause and Toy Story, kid-favorite Tim Allen is perfectly at home playing a family-friendly superhero. Once again, his quintessential average guy charm and smart-alecky humor serves him well. He is kid-friendly and easy-going and is very good at mining the beleaguered mentor/father-figure role for laughs and empathy. Tim Allen knows which films are suited for his not-too-deep talents. He doesn't seem to ""act"" as much as have fun and play his roles naturally (but maybe there's more to his ""acting"" than that). He overdoes it here with the belching, though.

On paper, you'd think this film would be enlivened by this pretty good cast. It isn't. I guess Chevy Chase really did stop making good movies after Foul Play. In this one, his irritating, incessant mugging just gets on my nerves. And the writer(s) does wrong with Courtney Cox-Arquette, as her Marsha Halloway becomes a fawning and over-the-top-klutzy scientist and Zoom's biggest fan. Again, her constant clumsiness and frequent crashes to the floor obviously play to the kids' brand of humor. The normally capable Rip Torn (Men In Black) once again digs into an officious, authoritarian role. But, this time, he doesn't fare as well. His Larraby is strident and one note; and his mustache, ever poised at full aggresive bristle, only seems to accentuate his phoned-in effort. I don't know too much about the kid actors but they look quite promising. Watch out for Ryan Newman as she steals all the scenes as the superstrong, willful little girl Cindy. Kate Mara as Summer is very watchable but doesn't get enough screen time to truly stand out.

There are obvious parallels drawn with the Harry Potter and The Bad News Bears series, but those parallels jarringly stop when it comes to quality and film smarts, of which this film shows a decided lack. This is another occassion where the duplicitous nature of trailers rears its ugly head. There's an abrupt, scattershot feel to the film, as the kids, for most of the time, are unruly and undisciplined; yet, within a too short span, they become this cohesive, highly efficient unit. The CGI is mostly effective, excepting the moments when Mega Kid (Tucker) is displaying his power (sorry, it looks too fake). The humor, as mentioned above, caters to the tots and pre-teens, and, I guess, the juvenile at heart. Zoom is a harmless, good natured effort, if more fluff than film. My prediction is that star Tim Allen, a supporting cast of some talent, and pretty good-looking production values ($60 million budget) are enough to elevate this film to modest summer hit status.

Even though the above is designated with a four star rating, this is actually a three star review. It could've been vastly better, but, as it is right now, and bearing in mind the film's target audience, it's not unpalatable.",1154822400,27,6580,4.903863432165319
2710385,4,B000LMPDXQ,This is a cute movie the kids enjoyed it. I rented it and I watched it like two or three times they liked it so well.,1498176000,,117,3.5384615384615383
2710386,4,B000LMPDXQ,"Tim Allen plays a cynical washed up superhero tasked with training super powered teens and tweens for an upcoming battle. Courtney Cox is the nerdy science girl who has idolized him forever. Chevy Chase mugs in doddering fool mode. Comedy ensues. Two moments stand out for their weirdness--

1. In the superhero selection scene, all of the white kids have good superhero powers and make it onto the team while all the kids of color have goofy superhero powers and are cut. No white kids are cut. No kids of color make it. For a movie from the mid-2000s, this is really strange. Some academic could do an interesting study on why the kids of color have visceral, organic powers like shooting spitballs, blowing gigantic orbs of mucus or farting.

2. One of the big moments in the film is not a fight scene but Tim Allen sitting reflecting while the camera swirls around him. You don't see many climactic, character arc-defining scenes with a guy pondering in a chair.

When this movie first came out, it was compared unfavorably to Sky High, another adolescent superhero flick which was released a year earlier. Sky High is indeed a far superior film with more wit, charm and stronger characters. Zoom is still cute though and gets the job done.  Look for: young Kate Mara.",1497139200,,1272,4.690582959641255

It is a good movie for kids who enjoy superheroes and light-hearted comedy. It has a few silly moments, but that's what my kids liked about the movie. It has some fighting, but I wouldn't call it violent. It was a very original and inventive story, and the kids also enjoyed the music in the movie.  Tim Allen was funny as a washed up super hero trying to (relunctantly) train a new generation of superheroes for a government program. The kids in the program are dealing with their super powers as well as their own issues.  It teaches good lessons everyone using their own unique skills while working together as a team. It also has Courtney Cox and Chevy Chase who are also very funny. This is an older movie, buy my kiddos still liked it. We took it to watch on one of our road trips and it kept them entertained and laughing. I think it would be a good, clean movie for younger kids and tweens (there are two younger kids, and two teenagers in the movie that the kiddos can relate to).

2710444,3,B000LMPDXQ,"Captain Zoom used to be a great superhero and leader of the government-sponsored superteam, Team Zenith. When the government tried to enhance his powers and those of his brother, Concussion, something went terribly wrong and Concussion turned evil and killed his teammates. Zoom stopped him and after the explosion, Concussion was presumed dead and Zoom lost his powers. Thirty years later, the government tries to resurrect Team Zenith using new kids with superpowers and recruits the retired Captain Zoom to train them. At the promise of a big paycheck, Zoom reluctantly agrees and when its revealed that the real reason behind the resurrection of the team is because the government discovered Concussion is still alive in another dimension and is plotting his return, Zoom takes it upon himself to make the team ready before his evil brother comes back and puts the planet in jeopardy.

This movie is based on the childrens book Amazing Adventures from Zooms Academy by Joe Lethcoe. Its a lighthearted superhero comedy, which is kind of like X-Men but with kids and tailored to that audience. Which is totally fine because kids need superhero movies, too, and with the majority of mainstream superhero stuff geared toward adults, Im glad flicks like this are made.

This flick is chock-full of big names and recognizable faces: Chevy Chase, Rip Torn, Courtney Cox, and, of course, Tim Allen in the lead. Speaking of whom, Tim Allen was pretty funny in this and if you liked him in Galaxy Quest, hes pretty much playing the same character of someone who once had glory but has fizzled out. The thing, too, is aside from the funny bits, when it came time to be serious and/or reflective and sad, he nailed it as well and you genuinely felt bad for the guy.

Courtney Cox was the biggest dork in this movie, which was perfect because that was her character. And she played it straight, too, that is, there was no tongue-in-cheek here, but a beautiful nerd that made you love her and roll your eyes at her at the same time.

Chevy Chasebig fan. As the head scientist for Team Zenith, hes just following orders, and with his trademark deadpan humor and wit, I can watch the guy all day.

The kids who made up Team Zenith: just fine. Cute. Funny with kid stuff. The little girl with the superstrength was adorable. The teenager stuff played by actors who were older in real life than their characterssuch a Hollywood thingI could do without, but I hate teenage angst garbage and wish we as a species could just skip those years as we go from kid to grownup. The superpowers displayed were definitely budget: superstrength, telekinetics, invisibility and clairvoyance, and a kid who can blow his body up like a balloon. Yet they worked those not-so-awe-inspiring abilities into the story and made them work for what they needed them to.

I will say that when Captain Zoom cranks up the superspeed later on, its pretty cool and makes me excited for a Flash movie if it ever happens.

Overall, Zoom is a decent flick, good for kids, and if you're a superhero fan its worth checking out for the sake of a fun time. However, if you're one of those people where everything has to be top notch, then youll be disappointed.",1436659200,,3212,4.735241502683363

2710467,2,B000LMPDXQ,"What can I say? This is one of those movies that are made for kids that think kids are easy to please with goofy comedy and sophomoric storytelling. It feels like so many movies that were done before it with hardly a new idea to present. This is sad considering the premise had some potential. In the end you get a superhero comedy that seems to only try to entertain with childish slapstick and special effects that may make your kid giggle at first, but will likely not be interested in watching again.

The actual premise isn't bad. Zoom (Tim Allen) is a down and out superhero that has been called back into action to train a new generation of gifted kids in hopes they can defeat the supervillain Concussion... who also happens to be Zoom's big brother. I know it sounds rather generic, but there was potential. Instead they went even MORE generic. Zoom doesn't like the kids. The kids do all sorts of pranks and act goofy. As you move later in the film Zoom gets his own montage to realize the new recruits are alright. Everybody starts working together and happy days. I'm sure I have seen this sort of plot get pulled off within a half hour on the Disney Channel.

When I say the script is bad I really mean it. It's oh... so bad. It gets to a point that when Concussion finally appears you have to wonder why these kids were recruited in the first place, as there seems to be no plan in utilizing them other than ""distract him while we shoot our secret weapon at him"". Really? There is one scene with Chevy Chase (who plays Dr. Grant) gets tormented by the kids for no reason whatsoever other than....oh I don't know... because the script thought it would be funny. When we get to the climax and conclusion of the film the whole challenge felt like an afterthought. In the end you have a lot of ridiculous fluff that would have been served with some more clever writing and jokes that weren't so predictable. The movie Sky High pretty much his a lot of the same points here with better execution years before this one came out. Makes me wonder if they were trying the same formula when coming up with this movie.

You have a good cast of actors in this film, which is a shame since they end up being really underutilized. Tim Allen plays the role with what gusto he can manage with writing involved. Courtney Cox is vibrant and seems to be one of the few who was able to pull some dimension off in her character. Chevy Chase is sorely underutilized as a goofy scientist type. Rip Torn is about as one dimensional as you can get (not his fault... it's in the script). So no complaints about any of the actors (including the kids), but man there is so little to work with here.

So there is some good in this movie aside from actors doing the best they can with what they got. You can start to feel some heart in the film once they got past the hackneyed adversarial roles that were written in. When the team starts working together with Zoom you start getting that feel good vibe. Also there is one, and only one, gag that was actually pretty funny when Zoom trips up over himself at high speed. So it's not like the movie is all bad. It's just got a lot less going for it.

The DVD comes with a couple extras to round out the experience. There is a making-of featurette called Bringing Superheroes to Life that gives you a rather bland presentation. It shows the cast and crew had a good time with the film, but it also hints at how the movie lacked some direction on where it wanted to go. The next extra is Academy of Superheroes Guide for Kids, which is a series of public service announcements that end up actually being funnier than the movie. That's about it. Not even the theatrical trailer is available.

Zoom: Academy for Superheroes is trite, weakly written, not really funny, and for me feels like an insult to their target audience. Which I know can enjoy more sophisticated comedies judging by the successes of Pixar, Dreamworks and the newer Disney productions. If you ask me I wouldn't even rent this aside from maybe a wayward Netflix stream if you really curious. In other words don't spend your money.",1420416000,,4128,4.417871222076215

My grandsons haven't seen this but I'm sure if they came across it, they would watch it over and over.  I looked it up... It was called one of the biggest flops of the year, if not the decade but, if you are looking for the kind of story, humor and special effects that lots of little boys love, this is it.  It's actually kid friendly, upbeat and full of action and kid level humor.  It's not dark or anti American... It's a superman story for the 21st century...

2710559,2,B000LMPDXQ,"Why must children films like this have to be so juvenile?  It's kids just fooling around, not doing anything important besides making a mess out of their surroundings.  This may be the type of material suited for its intended audience, but this is a superhero film, a genre that little kids would go crazy over.  A superhero film should leaps and bounds of action, fun, thrills, and adventure, but this movie doesn't bother to make the first step towards any of them, out of fear that it might be too dangerous for kids.  ""The Incredibles"" and even ""Sky High"" proved that they don't have to hold back on putting youths in serious peril, which makes them exciting and still be fun for kids.  ""Zoom"", on the other hand, is no more conflicting and energetic than an episode of ""Arthur"".  I don't mind if this is a ripoff of ""X-Men"", but have the characters do something that merits their own super attributes, not just wastes them.

There's not much of a story to be held.  About 60 minutes of an 80-minute movie (not counting the credits) is just a glorified training montage.  Tim Allen's character,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/who-s-named-after-a-spinal-surgeon-who-often-dealt-blows-with-a-bald-paraplegic/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">who's named after a spinal surgeon who often dealt blows with a bald paraplegic</a>, was picked up by the government to train kids with special powers to beat up a single badguy in a matter of days.  And for most of the training, he just lets the kids do their thing while he hits on Courtney Cox in a lab coat (fetish alert).  The kids are a mix of common stereotypes: the invisible man is the angst type, the one with telekinesis is the 'unattactive' outcast type (who's obviously attractive, and no doubt the angst and the outcast would hit it off), the inflatable kid is the tubby type, and the one with superhuman strength is a little girl whom I'm not certain if she has a British accent or a lisp; the little girl is the common ballerina likes-to-wear-frilly-clothes girl, and personally, she's an embarrassment to her kind.  All their little wacky antics add absolute nothing besides jokes that aren't even funny, like the scene where the kids trapped a lowly Chevy Chase into an experimental room and they pressed a bunch of buttons that activated environmental conditions that could've killed him; the part where it got way too silly is the skunk button, where a random skunk popped up and farted in Chase's face.  There's a lot of immaturity going on, from the part where the gov't auditioned kids and one of them blew a giant snotbubble (and obviously popped) while the other laid a giant gas to the annoying cartoon effects whenever a comedic pratfall occurs.  It's even more childish when the climatic battle occurred; there's no challenge or consequence when the Zoom team are fighting, they're just having a ball with the bad guy.  The childish camaraderie ruined the potential for a thrilling action sequence.

It's shameful that ""Zoom"" wanted to be safe, practically to a fault.  The only redeeming factor for such a wacky time-waste is an unintended suggestive innuendo when Courtney Cox's character said this line to a child:  'I know you don't have any control over this thing yet, but can you please try to expand?'  Thank goodness for the ability to take things out of context.",1280534400,,3395,5.0303571428571425

2710574,2,B000LMPDXQ,"Family-oriented comedy ""Zoom"" has the right cast. Tim Allen is a retired, washed-up ex-superhero who is given a mission to train a group of misfit kids with special ability. The trainees are played by Spencer Breslin, Kate Mara, Michael Cassidy and Ryan Newman. The film also has decent production designs, and is supported by the veterans like Rip Torn and Chevy Chase. So far, everything is great. Well, it might not be great exactly, but you can at least expect a decent family picture like ""Sky High.""

However, the film is helmed by a wrong director, Peter Hewitt, whose previous works include first ""Garfield"" movie and ""Thunderpants"" (just in case you haven't seen it, the latter is a one-joke film about a farting boy). For all the charms and the talent of the cast, and the characters' likable nature, those would-be superheroes/heroines becoming transparent or making the body and limbs bigger like rubber ball, have already been done in ""The Incredibles"" or other films of the same genre. With some wit or twists added, those characters would have been more interesting. As it is, they remain just OK with the lazy direction and very familiar sight gags.

The film's weak script, which does not explain convincingly why these kids must be brought together and trained like this, is already a problem. But the saddest thing is, for me, watching Chevy Chase covered with greenish sticky slime coming out of a boy's nose. It's a worse kind of gag than pie-throwing.

I like Tim Allen, but it makes me sad to see his recent films like this and ""The Shaggy Dog."" The film is not as bad as the very low user rating of IMDb suggests and the father-daughter-like relations between him and Ryan Newman is credible, but except that (and cute Ryan Newman) I cannot think of the reason why this film had to be made.",1186444800,3,1814,4.734177215189874

2710579,3,B000LMPDXQ,"We've all heard the saying, ""Shoulda, coulda, woulda.""  That's exactly what I thought as I viewed ""Zoom:  Academy for Superheroes.""  Had a little more time and care been taken with the script and if the director (Peter Hewitt) had cut back on the all-out hokiness of the picture, ""Zoom"" could have been a decent movie.  Instead, Tim Allen (Captain Zoom), Courteney Cox (Marsha Holloway) and an aging Chevy Chase (Dr. Grant) are forced to muddle their way through a seemingly slapped together family flick with a weakly held together plot and second-rate special effects.

**SPOILERS**

The premise of the story is this:  Zoom is a washed-up superhero who's called back into duty when his good-turned-evil brother, Concussion (Kevin Zegers), decides to return to Earth to wreak havoc.  Four kids aged six to seventeen and have special superpowers are collected for Zoom to turn into a team to fight Concussion.  The kids are played by Michael Cassidy (Houdini), Kate Mara (Wonder), Spencer Breslin (Mega Boy) and Ryan Newman (Princess).  As the film roles along we are given glimpses at the childrens' training in musical interludes and sometimes funny moments.  They pick at Dr. Grant, play throughout the training facility, and a romance even sparks between the two eldest kids.  Concussion's arrival is referred to throughout these little vignettes on a handy countdown screen that holds veteran Rip Torn's attention for the bulk of the film.  When Concussion finally gets around to exact his vengeance on mankind, everything turns out bland and unnecessarily ""nice.""

**End spoilers**

The film could use a little Gamma Thirteen radiation to kick it into gear.  It never gets moving and the plot is so weak and thin that the film comes across as nothing more than a showcase of weak special effects and music.  There is one nice cameo of Thomas F. Wilson (Biff from ""Back to the Future,"" and I also think I spotted Squiggy from ""Lavergne and Shirley"" as a Wendy's employee in an obvious marketing payoff during the film.

The DVD comes with some modest special features including the obligatory ""Making Of"" story and an ""Academy for Superheroes"" kid's guide.

Overall, this flick feels like a cheap knockoff of ""Sky High,"" which is a much better film.  If your child enjoys superhero flicks, ""Zoom"" may be up their alley.  There's only some very mild and brief language and the violence in non-bloody and really not that climactic.  In other words, this is an okay family film, but I'd still recommend ""Sky High"" instead.  Consider this one a rental.  If your kids like it enough, you might want to wait for it to hit the bargain bin before buying it.",1179100800,,2654,4.912359550561797

New heroes must quickly be trained to handle the coming threat.  Zoom is impressed into training the new young recruits (from 9 to 19).  But military security keeps Zoom from knowing what the training is for.  All in all, Zoom is not very motivated to help the program that robbed him of his childhood and family.  Eventually Zooms hardened heart is warmed up and he takes the training to heart, but not quite in the way the military would like.  Zoom does not want the kids to suffer in the way he did so he takes their side against the military.

As time quickly runs out, Zoom and his new team develop their powers and begin to learn how to work like a team.  Finally the dreaded moment arrives and Zoom's brother, Concussion, returns to our dimension.  Concussion is angry and looking for some payback.  Will the powerless Zoom and his new and untested team be able to stand against Zoom's greatest foe?  If they do, how will they handle their relationship with the military?  Watch and see.

While watching I had the feeling that the film makers either tried too hard or not hard enough.  This is obviously aimed at younger viewers but was cast to also appeal to parents.  The editing seems a bit sloppy with continuity of the time line and with reactions to special effects (reactions by Chevy Chase are slow like in a bad low-budget flick).  There is humor and a touch of romance but it just doesn't fit smoothly.  The wide range of ages was intended to appeal to a larger audience but it was mostly about Zoom and not the kids when it came to actual camera time.  Still, it is enjoyable and rather fun.  Just don't expect The Incredibles.",1176163200,,1776,4.507836990595611

2710586,4,B000LMPDXQ,"There has been a few negative reviews on this movie, but I'd have to disgree with them. The movie is about a washed up Superhero who is being pulled back into the mix by the government organization that originally sponsored his group. The original group having been wiped out by one of the leading members when he was turned evil by a Gamma-13 burst that was intended to make them mor epowerful. This is a classic comic book storyline that they've implemented into a movie setting. Jack Sheperd played by Tim Allen is a smart mouthed and cynical individual who is using his wit as a defense against people seeing the true situation. He was badly scarred emotionally by the loss of his brother and team mates. Then to add insult to injury he lost his powers as well.

This story is a tale about the personal quest of one person to try and overcome his demons while connecting with a new group and preventing something similar from happening to them. Its a very good family movie and I highly recommend it to people who are looking for a simple and entertaining movie.

I think the only point of growth that it could have used is a longer storyline developing out the characters a bit more. They did a very good job in making you connect with them in a short period, but I think the entire movie would have benefitted with having a little more content added to the storyline.",1173312000,3,1373,4.46613545816733
2710587,1,B000LMPDXQ,"One thing that bugged me was why were children chosen to fight Concussion?  Can acting get anymore uninspired?  Boring script and superheroes with redundant powers (telekinesis, strength, invisibility)...no originality.  Special effects were good in some areas and bad in others.  Plot was mediocre.  I would avoid this film, unless you want to add another to your list of bad movies. I bet Courtney loved Tim Allen's fast finger.",1173052800,7,430,5.264705882352941
2710588,4,B000LMPDXQ,"This seems to be a real love it or hate it movie. To everyone who hasn't weighed in, let me give you a few words of advice. If you're looking for a deep plot, a profound message, or award-winning characterization--don't bother because it's not here. However, if you're looking for a silly, shiny popcorn flick that you can spend a little time laughing at and you're willing to let go of any lurking high standards enough to enjoy it, then you're in the right place. Also, as I believe other reviewers have mentioned, this is a kid-targeted and kid-friendly film.",1172620800,28,562,4.63
2710589,4,B000LMPDXQ,"No, this won't win any academy awards.  Yes, the special effects like the 6-year-old lifting 2-ton weights are a bit cheesy and you can tell they are made out of plastic.  But this movie targets pre-teen kids and isn't supposed to be highly sophisticated.  Show it to some kids between the ages of 5 and 13 and see what they think - that's the demographic here. My guess?  They'll love it.  And if your kids are teens but haven't hit that ""everything is stupid"" stage, they'll probably like it too.

THE PLOT:
Tim Allen plays a grown-up and burned-out superhero named Zoom who can run real fast (think of ""Dash"" in the animated movie ""The Incredibles"").  As a child, Zoom was taken to a special academy (Area 52 in Nevada...more secret than Area 51) where he, his brother, and other kids with superhero powers are supposed to develop themselves.  While there, the government irradiates the kids to enhance their powers, something goes wrong, and Zoom's brother (Concussion) turns into an evil arch-nemesis where he is stuck in some kind of time warp.  Fast-forward 30 years.  Concussion is coming out of his time-warp to wreak havoc.  The army is preparing for his return and has recruited a batch of new superhero kids to battle him, and they've forcibly enlisted Allen (Zoom) to train the kids.  He's burned out and bitter about the same army that wrecked his life and his brother's life.  The movie charts his redemption as he slowly forms the new kids into a team that treats one another like a family, helping Zoom find his calling once again.

My pre-teen son picked this off the Blockbuster shelf because he'd seen a commercial for it.  I figured, what the heck, it's rated PG, let's take a chance on it.  So, we sat down that night with people from each of three generations: me (I'm 45), my son (he's 11), and his grandmother (she's 69).  We all enjoyed it.

THE GOOD:
1) Wholesome message - The kids feel like outcasts because of their powers and gradually learn to support one another.  There isn't the usual petty bickering like amongst siblings.  They get along and take care of one another.

2) Redemption - Zoom goes from a burned-out cynic to a genuinely caring father figure and role model by the end of the movie.  He redeems his long-lost brother (Concussion) as well.

3) Language - There's none of the usual potty mouth jokes and innuendoes.  This is a big deal for me.  I love many of the newer animated movies, like Shrek, but it as though the producers want to be certain that the adults watching the movie have humor directed at them, so they push the envelope with jokes they hope will go over the kids' heads but hit the adults.  Newsflash: if I want adult humor, I'll rent it.  The Incredibles was a great example of a movie that appealed to all ages without having to push the envelope.  Zoom was another great example.

4) Normal Kids - It didn't feature ""perfect"" kids as one had a speech impediment, one was overweight, and one was moody and picked on by the cool kids at school.  It was nice to see ""regular"" kids cast in this movie instead of just the popular, beautiful images of perfect hair, perfect teeth, and popularity that the Disney Channel usually gives us with kids like Jamie Lynn Spears and Hillary Duff.

THE BAD:
There really wasn't anything I didn't like about the movie, but we happened to watch it while we were eating pizza and there are a few places where it gets a bit gross: one involving flatulance and one involving mucous.  Consider yourself warned - it doesn't mix well with food.

THE UGLY:
Uh, none to speak of.  Tim Allen seems a bit obsessed with Courtney Cox's little green dress.  No ugliness there, I can assure you.

THE ACTORS:
In addition to Allen, there are some other actors that adults will enjoy here.  Courtney Cox (Friends) plays a dweeby and ultra-clumsy scientist who has a crush on Zoom.  Chevy Chase of Saturday Night Live fame plays the aging nobel-prize-winning director of Area 52.  His makeup is hysterical and he dresses in fashions from the 1970s.  Rip Torn plays the gruff army general who views the kids as collateral weapons to be used, not human beings of value.  Allen is like a one-man arsenal of funny one-liners and quips and is constantly peppering Torn's and Chase's characters with ascerbic wit.  He's a quintessential Smart Alec in this movie.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
But all in all, it was a truly fun movie.  Kids will like the special effects and the comic-book plot and won't see the cheesy-ness: they'll think it is cool - the top-secret installation, the superhero costumes, the training, and the unique superpowers each person has.  Adults will like the wholesomeness of the message and the absence of violence and language.

Buy it?  I dunno.  We rented it.  My suggestion: rent it first and if you like it, get it for your library.  It's the type of movie kids will want to watch several times, while adults will probably find that once is sufficient.",1172620800,10,4951,4.621559633027523
2710590,1,B000LMPDXQ,"Honestly, this movie was bad.  I usually don't write reviews, but this movie was just BAD.  That said, I bought it for my kids because at 8 and 10,they aren't really ""plot driven"", and they think it's funny.  I say it just has no real story...they just put a bunch of ""junk"" on tape and hoped it would fly.  No pun intended.",1171929600,9,324,4.17741935483871
2710591,1,B000LMPDXQ,"I don't know what possessed me to rent this DVD from my local Movie Gallery, but rest assured I will never listen to that voice again.  I was thinking that this would turn out to be just another benign version of ""Sky High"" (to which it pales in comparison) but boy, was I ever wrong.

This movie sucks.  Big time.  I did not get a single laugh out of it.  My 8- and 6-year old kids may have smiled over the costume changes of Cindy, the super-strong tyke, but for the most part they just stared blankly at the screen.  My older child prudently declared at the end: ""This was a stupid movie"".

The kid characters were good-looking enough, but they all lack some crucial aspect that would endear them to the audience. Dylan/Houdini seems lost, literally and figuratively for most of the movie, not knowing if he's a boy or man and lacking the leadership the team seems to be needing, and not having enough teen angst to carry the weight of the role.  Summer/Wonder seems to be the best of the bunch, with enough emotional range but not enough charisma, which is ironic since the graphic novel seems to be based on her character.  Tucker/Megaboy plods through his role, unsure whether he likes his newfound expandable waistline.  Cindy/Princess is ingratiatingly cute but comes across as bratty, throwing several temper tantrums throughout.  Courtney Cox displays lackluster performance - her acting prowess is about the same as when she was in ""Masters of the Universe,"" and that was two decades ago!  Rip Torn was disappointing as Larraby, as was Chevy Chase, who lost his comedic talent back in the nineties.

Don't even get me started on Tim Allen.  I understand he has to play the role of the reluctant hero who must come out of his shell to play mentor to these fledgling superheroes but he just comes across as a sleazy bum with overtones of sexual deprivation (notice how he keeps asking about Couteney's green dress) who should have been left alone with the losers, as Larraby suggests in one sequence.  I half-expected him to start pawing at Courteney like Gollum would at the One Ring.  He never really taught the kids anything, and comes up with this ""family"" concept at the end, which he had been avoiding all along because of his rift with his brother.  Puh-lease, gimme a break. I wish he would have just vibrated himself out of the movie altogether.

Plot? What plot?  Some subpar writers merely mixed together a hodge-podge of plot elements from Harry Potter, Spy Kids, Sky High, and other comic book story lines to create what they believe is a humorous, family-friendly action movie.  Sadly, it falls flat on its face, and actually goes a few feet under a couple of times.  Most of the action sequences involve lame training exercises, and there's really only the climactic scene with Concussion where you see them actually using their powers together.  IMHO, Concussion should have whupped them to a different dimension where they might have done better as a B movie cast.  I don't blame him one bit for returning to annihilate Area 52.

There are good movies and there are bad movies and there are movies that never should have been made.  Sadly, like ""Howard the Duck"" and ""Battlefield Earth"" before it, ""Zoom"" belongs to the latter.",1171670400,11,3253,4.715044247787611
