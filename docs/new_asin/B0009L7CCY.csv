8078601,1,B0009L7CCY,I am very disappointed with this video. The length of the practice provided in this DVD is less than 2 minutes. In the rest of the 48 minutes he explains how to do the easy movements. Who needs such lengthy explanation. I was expecting to have 50 minutes of practice and the explanations to be provided along the practice. I certainly do not recommend buying this product.,1188950400,4,372,4.567164179104478
