Karim presents information in a clear, well organized and articulate manner; he really has a gift for teaching.  Anyway, there is loads of great information on this DVD.  If you want to learn good, solid Arabic technique fundamentals, you can't go wrong here.

He covers articulations in all the basic playing styles from ""open"" style, as usually seen in a cabaret setting to the ""closed"" style, often seen in more of a classical setting to ""loud"" style, which includes rhythmical shaking and the like, for when the music gets really energetic.  Then he shows you how to switch back and forth from one playing style to another in mid-stream.  He goes over a variety of rhythms from both popular dance forms and more classical Arabic genera in depth using various modes and levels of embellishment within each playing style.  At the end, he brings the technical teaching together with proper musicianship, demonstrating the riqq player's primary role as a percussionist, i.e., to punctuate and provide a frame for the melody as well as drive the piece along through tempo, style and  improvisation.",1510531200,,1216,4.985148514851486
