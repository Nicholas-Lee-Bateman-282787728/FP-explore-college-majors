8102462,4,B000DN5W16,"""Mystic lands"" (1996 TV series documentary) [1996-1997] is a collection of documentaries where we visit different parts of the world and see how religions have evolved in those parts of the world from their origins to what they are today.

There is lots of color lots of sound general descriptions and the most important is when the lock on to a particular location as the time or Greece, they stay in the location long enough for you to get the feeling that you've been there. And also impressive is that this is not a one of those little sound bite modes we keep going back and forth from one person to the next the first of the next and back to the first. However we did hear from different experts.
