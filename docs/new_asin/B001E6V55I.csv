8297007,5,B001E6V55I,"In the 1980s I used to show this short 16mm film in my high school biology classes before introducing the topic of human genetics.  I think it is important for students to realize that people with genetic abnormalities are not ""defective"", but their condition is just part of who they are within the natural continuum of humanity.  Human genetics should not be taught as some kind of freak show.  One year I had a student with Turner's syndrome.  She was a brilliant mathematician but definitely had many problems associated with her condition.  Getting her peers to understand and accept her for who she was was a challenge.  This film is a good way to open the topic of human variation to discussion.",1349654400,,702,4.713114754098361
8297008,5,B001E6V55I,"I saw this many years ago as a teen and now, with 7 children of my own, I wanted them to experience it as well. As this short documentary played, you could have heard a pin drop as my children watched Leo's life story. I suspect they will remember the impact it had on them 30 years from now, just as I have. Every living soul should see this on their lifetime...",1334275200,2,363,4.055555555555555

8297010,5,B001E6V55I,"I first saw this short (<20 minute) movie in 1971.  It was shown as a 16mm movie for our Sunday School class.  We were a large group of fidgeting 9 - 10 year olds just wishing that class could be over.  After our teacher showed the movie, there was absolute dead silence in the entire room.  She asked us a couple of questions to try and start a class discussion, but it was to no avail.  We were all speechless.  She proceeded to rewind the film and showed it to us again and a few of us could finally talk.  It's been 40 years since I saw this film and have never forgotten it or the impact it made on my life.",1318204800,,612,3.9672131147540983
