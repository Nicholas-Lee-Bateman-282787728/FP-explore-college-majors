I loved the book and I loved the movie.  Yes, there were flaws, but overall this was a really good movie. The acting was pretty good.  Effects good for a lower budget movie.  My only big issue is that the pacing was too fast in the latter half of the movie, but I can forgive that.
  Second favorite YA adaptation after The Hunger Games.  If you have also read the book, please go see the movie.  You will not be disappointed.  I really hope this movie gets a sequel because if it doesn't I will be really upset.",1453507200,3,526,4.128712871287129
7614009,3,B01AYDOI1O,"""The 5th Wave"" (2016 release; 112 min.) brings the story of an Ohio teenage girl and her family. As the movie opens, we see the teenage girl (played by Chlo Grace Moretz) running, with assault weapon in hand, into a deserted convenience store. Someone cries out for help, and in the ensuing standoff, she accidentally shoots and kill the young man. We are perplexed: what is going on here? Then the movie shifts back, and we see the young woman Cassie and her family going about their regular lives: high school kids at a party, a football game, etc. Then one day, out of nowhere appears a gigantic UFO and eventually bad things start happening... To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the YA book of the same name. I haven't read the book so I can't comment how faithful the movie is to the book. The movie starts out great. The first 15-20 minutes we get to see the various 'waves' of bad things happening caused by the aliens, whom Cassie initially refers to as nothing but 'galactic party crashers'  but then are nicknamed The Others (1st wave: all power is lost, 2nd wave: global flooding, 3rd wave: airborne deadly virus), and I was thinking 'this could be one heck of a sci-fi film'. Alas, it was not to be. Once the 4th wave comes around (the aliens infiltrate the humans), the movie starts losing momentum. On top of that, the plot takes a number of completely implausible turns and twists that will leave you bewildered. On top of that a teenage romance develops between two of the main characters that simply doesn't help the movie. Comparisons with The Hunger Games franchise are obvious on a number of levels but let's be clear: this movie doesn't come close to The Hunger Games! Chlo Grace Moretz is just about the movie's lone saving grace, and she does the best with the (weak) material that she is given. It's really a darn shame that a movie that starts out so promisingly eventually falters so badly. This is supposed to be the first of a trilogy of films but I am going to sit out the rest (if they are even made). Last but not least, there are some great song placements in the movie, the best of them being Sia's ""Alive"", which plays over the movie's end titles.

The movie opened nationally this weekend, and the early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so, which surprised me, given this was the first day of release. This does not bode well for the financial well-being of the movie, and the lack of strong word of mouth won't help matters either. If you are a fan of The Hunger Games, you may want to give this a try, just to see but keep your expectations low.",1453507200,34,2739,4.474

7614025,3,B01AYDOI1O,"The 5th Wave is a rare of example of a film I enjoyed despite hating the novel it was based on. The book was extremely slow, as it was narrated by the lonely girl the film is focused on. She re-lived her experiences in flashbacks in the book, while the movie is more straightforward, therefore eliminating some of the monotony. Still the film isn't without it's flaws, as it is based on an idea that has been done to death. Aliens have invaded the Earth once again and this time they have done it in four crushing waves. Most of the planet is in ruins, millions are dead, and the few that are left have banded together to try and form some sort of resistance. A 5th wave is coming and the military has surmised that children will be the least affected by it, and have begun rounding them up and training them as soldiers. Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is one of these children, who is devastated to be separated from her family, but at the same time happy to be fighting along side her life long crush Ben Parish (Nick Robinson). For me, this film was less about the story and more about it's stars. As I said I didn't really care for the story, it's been done, and the whole Hunger Games love angel just seemed to be a lazy rip off. What I did enjoy was seeing two of Hollywood's biggest young stars together in the same film, Chloe Grace Moretz and Nick Robinson. Both of them have been getting bigger and better roles and to finally see them together in a major blockbuster film was a treat. Moretz's character was just another Katniss Everdeen/Tris clone, but she played in well. The true star of the film, was Nick Robinson, the popular kid in High School who transforms into Zombie, the fearless leader of the youthful army. Films like Kings of Summer and Being Charlie saw Robinson take the reigns and make those films his own, and in a way he did the very same thing here. He may not have been THE star, but he certainly was the one to watch, as he was involved in every great scene this movie had to offer. The 5th Wave is a mix of elements and characters simply stolen from other similar stories. The special effects were terrific, the young cast was out of this world, but as a whole, this film wasn't anything special.",1517788800,,2237,4.366906474820144

Just like the in the Iliad, we are introduced into the middle of the war that had been going on. We get a quick snippet of Achilles Oops I meant that cutie little actress Chlo Grace Moretz running around in her BDUs. Get a quick background of what a wave is and what the first four waves were. There is the standard shoot them up survivors and treachery from the bad guy aliens.

The movie ends as with the Iliad not when the war ends but when Hector I mean our half alien character is dispatched. We are left hanging and waiting for a sequel.

You might just is well wait for the sequel and bypass this time spending save my little brother sequence.

Every action that happened after the first ten minutes was predicted in advance by one of us watching. This film was a great example of the unimaginative garbage that is being turned out by filmmakers today. The writers of this tripe should be ashamed of themselves. That said, the actors did a sincere enough job considering the material. The action, what there was, seemed okay. The romance novel plot was ghastly. In my opinion, this was one bad movie.

7614050,3,B01AYDOI1O,"More of a young adult film than a serious sci-fi movie.  An alien space craft arrives and circles the globe. All of the power goes out and everything electric shuts down due to a powerful EMP pulse. That was the first wave. The attacks continue wiping out mankind all over the globe. Floods, plagues, nothing electrical works.  The attack continues and a young 17 year old girl is one of the survivors. Can she survive the 5th wave of the alien attack

This is not a good sci-fi film. The young survivor is trying hard to get back with her little brother. She has to travel over 80 miles on foot through alien infested territory. The aliens are like body snatchers and you can't tell who is human and who is not.

This film moves slowly and at times is boring. The acting is average at best and at some times just really bad. The storyline had potential but it just never fully developed into a serious sci-fi film. The script was slow moving at times and some of the young actors were just over the top bad. When the movie got slow it developed a young love attraction plot. It didn't help the film at all.

If you are a hard core sci-fi freak then is film is a 2 or 3. If you are young and like YA films then this film would be a 4 or 5. I honestly watched it but it wasn't great. I gave it a 3 only because of the twists and turns in the plot.",1498521600,,1346,4.102661596958175

It eventually got more interesting and exciting but it didn't last long because it was over. The ending didn't really make me feel satisfied or like the main characters accomplished that much.

They are just so obviously from an immature mind and mature ones just can't ignore that. I will first note that this movie really really skimped on the special effects. I am sure they thought we wouldn't notice but... we did.  The first four waves come quickly and perfunctorily because they didn't have the special effects budget to get into them in detail.  At this point we await the 5th. The main character Cassie is on the run looking to find her brother, ok, i can get behind that. But every part of the story past this point is something out of the mind of a 17 year old. Cassie meets an older and very good looking guy Ethan who takes care of her. But spoiler alert he is one of the aliens who rebelled against them because he is in love with Cassie? Oh please. Just looking at her made him ""rebel"" or flip his switch back on. That is 17 year old thinking.  The 5th wave is apparently humans taking out humans. The children are taken away and brainwashed into hunting down humans that they think are bad guys. The problem for me on this... what a complicated plan. Why don't the others just hunt them humans down? SO much easier.  Or even why bother... they are wiped out.",1485043200,,1329,4.304

I think it could have been a much better movie and that's why I'm giving it one star.  Anything interesting they could have done with this film, was not done.  The traitor alien was cool and nothing happened with that.  The main theme was a young lady finding her brother and giving him back his Teddy Bear.  Also did it have to be a bear?

7614150,2,B01AYDOI1O,"As alien invasion stories go, this is not a top notch example.  Perhaps beginning with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-War-of-The-Worlds/dp/1500952303/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The War of The Worlds</a>, alien invasion stories have been a staple of the science fiction genre.  In the 1950s the genre exploded as people couldn't get enough of the thought of meanie aliens coming to Earth & trying to evict us.

The trick with realistic alien invasion stories is coming up with an ""angle"" that we homo sapiens might have in fending off the aliens.  At best, it's going to be David vs. Goliath.  At worst, it is going to be a lamb vs. T-Rex.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day-Repackaged/dp/B00008G8M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day Repackaged</a>, for example, was successful in that it is plausible that aliens may not have the concept of a computer virus (just as WAR OF THE WORLDS took into account the fact that aliens might not anticipate hostile Earth-bound microbes).

While the present film has some decent eye candy FX which depict the aliens trying to take us out (as the title indicates, they do so via ""waves of attack"") the story just has too many holes in the plot for me to give it a positive review.  Also, the method by which the aliens ultimately want to do-us-in does not seem tenable, given the huge gap in technological superiority that they enjoy over we humans.

The bright spot of the movie is Chlo Grace Moretz who plays a high school athlete named Cassie.  She does a credible job of making us sympathetic to  a high school student whose life is turned upside down as she's forced to deal with the apocalypse.  It is mostly through her eyes that the story is unveiled.  While ultimately I did not find this storyline plausible, for people who are die hard fans of the alien invasion genre, this 1 might be worth a look.",1470528000,,1961,5.3311688311688314

Okay, I picked up this blu-ray cheap because it looked interesting and I'm not a  real picky movie watcher.  It has a decent amount of action and blow 'em up to make the guys happy.  It's a fast paced story that honestly, I think it would helped a bit if they slowed the pace down and gave the viewer a chance to get to know the characters and delved into their lives a bit more.  Goes from the main character having a crush on a boy in her school to the Earth being besieged by some kind of aliens - taking out everything electronic with an EMP, then a virus like the bird flu, tsunamis, etc...  One thing after another after another until they get to the 'Fifth Wave'.

You don't ever really 'see' the enemy.  There are/were sleeper cells of the enemy that had infiltrated the humans - of course our main protagonist runs into one that happens to see her and becomes more 'human' instead of alien.  Ehh.  This kind of reminds me of the movie The Host  - which really let me down as I was expecting a lot more from it.  This was okay, interesting and could have been made into either a longer movie, or into a couple movies so they could have expanded on the backstory somewhat.

It wasn't bad, it wasn't great.  it was an okay movie that has a lot of potential - maybe they're planning on continuing it from where they left off - we'll see.  If you like movies, try and get it cheap - if you're on the fence wait and see if you can watch it on Amazon Prime or Netflix or something else like that.  I may end up watching it again in the future - one of the reasons I like to buy blu-rays is to re-watch  movies whenever I want, along with any special features that might be on the disc that interests me.",1468368000,3,1752,4.133136094674557

You can see in the deleted scenes on the Blu-ray, which would have cleared up much confusion on how things happened.  Who really wants to watch Cassie running over and over through the woods, or all the nights they showed her in the woods.  So many great parts of the book left out of the movie, No explanation in the movie of why Ben is mentally tortured or Vosch's interest in him or what happens with Rezanik, his story is totally changed, Poundcake is a completely different character, and what about Tank, his scenes were completely removed. Flintstone lives and is Ben's friend, and no explanation of how Ben became squad leader.  All that effort to train these kids for the movie, but not enough expansion on what they were trained on.  I enjoyed what was on the Blu-ray that was not part of the movie, more than the movie itself.  But still worth watching, as Nick Robinson (Ben) and Alex Roe (Evan) are going to go far in their careers.

7614290,1,B01AYDOI1O,"The 5th Wave is yet another YA apocalyptic dystopian future film based on a novel series in which the teens must save The Universe and the future of all mankind in spite of stupid and ignorant adults. Its an Us against The Universe struggle in which failure will cause Certain Death and Human Extinction. As if Hunger Games, Divergent, and Maze Runner hadn't overcrowded the genre sufficiently, making it a worn-out trope, we now have this one. Chlo Grace Moretz has some good credits and strong performances as a very young actress, but this one should be buried in her resume to avoid being associated with it. It's not so much her as the plot, script and directing, the responsibility for which must be laid at the feet of the producers and director. The story is a disparate and disconnected collage of all the YA dystopian society movies that preceded it. The general concept had some promise as a sci-fi horror film, but the execution of it as a YA trope instead is a failure. The result is a wholly predictable plot laden with YA theme tropes worn so thin now you can read a newspaper through them. It's my hope that The 5th Wave is perceived by the studio as not performing well enough that the franchise is allowed to die a quiet death without a sequel, to be thrown onto the rubbish heap alongside ""The Host"" (2013; if you haven't heard of it, be glad, very glad). Save your time and money. Much better alien invasion films: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978; the 1956 is OK), ""Mars Attacks!"", ""War of the Worlds"" (2005), ""They Live"", ""The Faculty"", ""Attack the Block"", ""The World's End"", and ""The Blob"" (1958 and 1988).

'Cassie' and her younger brother 'Sammy' (Zachary Arthur) have to climb a tree quickly to avoid an on-coming wave.
The third act sees a plague spread by the birds , known as 'The Red Death' which see's many, many humans perish including
'Cassie's' mother.
'Cassie' and 'Sam's' father try's to find a safe haven for them, they come across a refugee camp where they hope they will
safe for the time being, however a U.S Army Unit turns up, the commander tell the refugee's that they are in danger and
make arrangements for the young to be ferried to safety at a military unit promising to return to reunite the parents with
the children.
'Cassie' has promised her father she'd tale care of young 'Sam' however they become separated......now 'Cassie's' sole aim
is to reach he brother at the unit.
On her journey she becomes injured at the hands of a sniper, waking up some days later she finds herself being cared for by
a stranger 'Evan' (Alex Roe) who 'Cassie' is immediately wary of.
'Evan' tells 'Cassie' of the may dangers out there and that 'The Others' (aliens) have taken over receptive humans and are combing
the forests to kill humans, 'Evan' offers to help her find her brother.
Meanwhile the Children that were taken to the camp have been trained-up as soldiers to kill ''The Others''
'Sam' is part of 'Ben Parish / Zombie's' (Nick Robinson) squad, 'Ben' an old school-friend of 'Cassie's'
Not everything is as it seems......will 'Cassie' be reunited with her young brother with the help of 'Evan' who perhaps has his own
agenda.
The World will come to rely upon the young to save mankind, they have become 'The Fifth Wave'
Fairly typical material in truth, a hint of young romance along the way,
There are a few good special-effect sequences in the film though i'd liked to have seen more.
The film does sadly labour a little at times, though i feel the film should be seen as the vehicle to introduce the main characters
going forward.
Though the film didn't do as well as hoped at the U.S Box-Office it did i suspect do well enough World-Wide to encourage the film
makers to set about filming the second in the series - 'The Infinite Sea' and perhaps the third - 'The Last Star' ...guess we'll see.
(Though many a series has been started in recent years and not continued)

Four waves of increasingly deadly attacks have left most of Earth in ruin. Against a backdrop of fear and distrust, Cassie is on the run, desperately trying to save her younger brother. As she prepares for the inevitable and lethal fifth wave, Cassie teams up with a young man who may become her final hope - if she can only trust him.

The 5th Wave is a really exciting sci-fi movie with great ideas, its a movie that don't need to show much in the way of aliens and high tech stuff like most sci-fi, instead we get a basic underline plan of what is happening and the movie is driven by a wonderfully strong young cast of great actors and actresses and an enjoyable story of family and saving those we care about, the movie of course has some top notch effects especially when we see the early waves destroy the earth, the movie has an invasion of the body snatchers feel to it mixed with other things, the movie is well paced and builds up really well over the run time and keeps you interested mainly due to a strong cast especially the lovely Chloe Grace Moretz who is a fantastic young actress who is probably at her best in this movie, the rest of the cast is good too, the soundtrack is great too, this is a top notch sci-fi that's really worth checking out if you want something that's original, easy on the brain and not too over the top, and has a bit more heart to the story.

I'll try not to reveal much, but if you don't want to know anything ahead of time then stop reading.  I'm okay with a movie having a couple of loose ends, and with some things not being explained, but this movie has too many of both.  There is a third criticism I'll touch on at the end.  Even if this is one movie of a potential series, it doesn't give you enough to satisfy you.  The movie barely mentions what the different waves are.  It doesn't say how the ""others"" brought about these waves.  Nothing is mentioned about the ""others"" except that they're from somewhere else, want our planet, and can take over a human body.  The third criticism is the predictability.  Just about every movie has some predictable parts, but with this one I saw everything coming well in advance and I never even saw a preview or knew anything about the movie ahead of time.  I just saw the movie picture on redbox and figured it might be a decent end of the world sci-fi flick.  Okay, so from my review you'd think I hated it.  Not necessarily.  It was mildly entertaining.  I would have preferred it to have gone in some other directions.  My wife enjoyed it okay.

7614299,2,B01AYDOI1O,"I had serious issues with the plot even after considering its written for teens (I assume that).  It has so many plot holes and such two dimensional acting I just could not find any way to enjoy the film.  SPOILER ALERTS!!!!!  It was so obvious in the first few minutes that the military was under the control of the aliens it took no effort at all to 'figure that out', it was the acting and the dialogue *and a plot point* that gave it away so ridiculously easy.  The 'over-acting' of the soldiers was a big tip-off, the soldiers taking the children but slaughtering all the adults was a HUGE plot give-away, the female soldier who was overseeing the 'induction' of the children played her part so horribly it made the rest obvious.  Then the double agent 'pretty boy' type that shows up rescuing her, no depth or dimension nor any build-up, he's just suddenly there and turns out he's an alien double agent turned 'good guy'.  He could use superhuman abilities against other aliens but she *a teen girl who had a few weeks of surviving* could give him a fight...meh.  Everything about this film screamed poor writing, by its content its for teenagers but honestly the level of the film is more at the 8 year old level; the plot has so many holes as to be an insult to even a mediocre teen intellect.  I cannot say whether the acting was 'bad' (except for that female soldier who just horrible horrible horrible) because the writing was so bad as to preclude anything else.

In the 1st 5 minutes I told myself wow, this dialogue is something a 14 year old would like, a lot. No spoiler here, the plot was predictable, VERY PREDICTABLE, but only for older watchers, younger people who have not experienced hundreds of SciFi movies will be excited and anxious for more.
Chloe Grace Moritz was excellent as were nearly every actor for what they were given to work with. Also, Liv Shrive was believeable, which had to be hard for him given his material.
I would recommend you buy it if you are 17 or younger, or if you are a parent with younger children you can sit through this with them without worrying about corrupting their morals.",1462924800,8,922,4.3604651162790695

7614315,1,B01AYDOI1O,"Bad on every variable/level/potential area for any type of criticism.
Acting: Mostly TV series resum supporting actors who were in the film for cheapness or candy eye appeal and to rip off the under 18 demographic. What's going on with Chlo Grace Moretz? Was ""Kick Ass"" the pinnacle of her career because nothing since is worth remembering? Does she need the money? I'll give her some if she'll put the hard work in and be more discerning. Oh well!

Storyline: What part of the miss-mash of this film has not been ripped off from countless other ""apocalyptic"", alien infestation, youth to the rescue past productions?  It's the current, cheap, faddish TV vibe. Then there's the ""let's-sit-around-the-campfire"" ending left stupidly vague enough to suggest a sequel. Creative? The buildup to Chlo to save love interest subplot was more laughable than believable.

Dialogue: Apart from the robotic recitation it was below sophomoric level intelligence - definitely middle school level standard. ""Others"", that's what we now call aliens. Haha. That must have really challenged the writer's extensive lexicon.

Graphics can always save a sci-fi flick: Not this time. The worst floating (How? Who knows and cares.) alien craft yet seen. Looked like made by a grade schooler with Legos when left unattended. The physics of the thing would not get past a middle schooler without them laughing. The stolen idea of an alien clinging thingy was bad, but the graphics were '70s level cheap. Again more laughable than scary. .

Props: I get into hysterics every time I see an apocalyptic film with cars on a roadway strewn in a variety of directions, usually with a few bodies or burning tires placed appropriately. If a viewer takes the time and looks at the pattern/spacing/directions and other attributes it doesn't make any sense. Even the panic evacuation of Fort McMurray recently, the cars were still orderly.

Directing & Editing: There must not have been a director on this film since it was totally (seriously) directionless. In consort was the editor who spliced & diced like a sushi chef who has never handled a knife before.",1462924800,5,2124,5.037037037037037

7614320,3,B01AYDOI1O,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

One thing can be said about Hollywood. When they discover a money making concept theyll milk it as dry as a bone. This doesnt mean those movies made about a topic are bad but after a while they all sort of get mixed in together and it becomes hard to differentiate one from another, especially when they're being released fast and furious (no, not that franchise here). Lately it seems that the only reason for adults in films is to give birth and then stand back and idly watch while teens do things like save the world. That premise is a big part of THE 5TH WAVE.

Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) is your typical teen girl (as far as movie makers are concerned). She goes to school, pines over the good looking boy Ben (Nick Robinson) and loves her parents. Her life gets turned upside down within short order here as the Earth is invaded by aliens in attacks termed waves. The first wave is an EMP that knocks out all electrical systems, the second a combination of earthquake/tsunami that wipes out the coasts, the third is a form of disease spread by birds and the fourth are termed silencers, invaders who look human.

As Cassie and her family deal with each successive wave until most of the world is ended, they make a last ditch effort with others to band together in a camp. When the army shows up commanded by Col. Vosch (Liev Schreiber) everyone is overjoyed. With buses only big enough to handle so many at a time they're filled with the youngest members of the camp first to take them to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Cassie is on board with her brother Sam who forgets his teddy bear. As she runs to get it, the buses leave her behind.

The joy is short lived as the adults in the group argue about letting their children go unaccompanied, a fight breaks out and in an attempt to regain order the troops open up on the parents. Cassie hides during this but returns to find her father now dead joining her mother who died in the disease wave. Determined to find her brother, she packs up the essentials and heads out on foot to be rejoined with him. Along the way shell face the dangers of alien drones that watch from the sky as well as silencers all around.

As all of this goes on the Army takes the young people left on the world and begins training them to be the next armed forces to protect the planet. Visors are developed to allow the wearer to see the aliens beneath the surface of the humans infested by them. Ben has made it to the base as well and Sam is a part of his group. While Cassie tries to find her way to them the youth groups train, preparing for a special mission. In the end a few twists and turns (that some will see early on) occur and people the characters may have trusted once are not what they seem. In the end will the Earth by saved or not?

The movie offers a decent science fiction tale here, another in a long line of alien invasion films that dates back to 1953s WAR OF THE WORLDS. This time around the concept of teen heroes has been added, a genre that has been around but seems to have found more traction lately as well as become a huge franchise generating machine for Hollywood with the success of both THE HUNGER GAMES and DIVERGENT. The odds are that the same was intended for this movie but the box office figures haven't done as well as expected so odds are this one ends here. I won't say thats a good or bad thing when it comes to the actual movies themselves but the non-stop offerings of teens saving everything, being smarter than adults or taking over every screen on multiplexes across the country has made for some truly lackluster movies.

Box office sales are up but only because the price of the tickets has risen as well. As corporations control the movies we see the more pre-packaged product and less real movies we get at the theater. Certainly there is a way to balance that but as long as the number crunchers are in control the odds aren't favorable in that happening. Once those numbers begin to drop perhaps but that may take a while.

So for the time being lets enjoy movies like this even if they have become predictable. The acting in this one is better than most and the production values are quite well done. While there are no standout performances and every teen looks fresh from the pages of a fashion magazine, all in all each does a solid job here. The effects are well done, a definite requirement for a movie like this, but at the same time don't offer a lot thats new.

While typing this I realized my final view on this film. Its not bad for a nights entertainment but it won't be one that you remember a year from now, a movie that will be talked about in 30 years or that will increase the star power of anyone involved. Its a vanilla movie, one that taste good but offers no substantial flavor. You can do worse with a movie to watch at home than this, but don't expect it to change the world either.",1462752000,,4962,4.338362068965517

7614322,5,B01AYDOI1O,"This is a pretty fun movie, it's based on the first (of three so far) books in a series written by Rick Yancey. Like most movies based on books whose target market is young teens, the main characters are teens and younger kids, and those young teens are played by actors a bit older than the character's ages. If you watched Red Dawn in the 80's or Tomorrow When the War Began if you're too young to have done that, that's pretty much the sort of plot this series of books (and hopefully it will be a series of movies) follows, only instead of Russia or North Korea as the enemy, it's aliens. Chlo Grace Moretz plays Cassie, the central character who also narrates to the watcher what has happened alien invasion wise, she recounts and we see footage of events of the first four waves of attacks. I liked this as it made the movie very easy to understand, you could watch this when tired and understand what is going on, which hasn't necessarily been the case with other big name young adult fiction based movies in recent times. The 5th attack wave hasn't occurred when children are bused off by the army and Chloe's journey to find her brother begins (after the annoying little kid threw a tantrum because he didn't have his bear with him and she runs off to get it). She's got to journey on foot through a Walking Dead style (without the zombies) ruins of society, where like that show there's predators out there for an attractive teen girl travelling by herself.

The storyline is pretty simple, and if you wanted something with heaps of surprises you'll be disappointed. I knew nothing about the story going in and found the camp ground events, the army base stuff and well most scenes to be obvious how they were going to play out, but that didn't mean I didn't enjoy watching them. Moretz and the other actors do a pretty good job, some of the other young actors though have a limited or cheesy script to act out though. But they do a great job with what they have. I imagine these characters we'll see more substance with in the aftermath of this movie's events if they turn the other books into movies too.

For an invasion film / war film this is very child viewer friendly which may put some potential viewers off. The only thing I think let this movie down though was the CGI. In I think it was the third or fourth attack, we have a tidal wave which you could clearly see the little squares making up the computer image as it supposedly flooded a tree Cassie and her brother had just climbed. But this only drops the film half a star in rating for me.",1462579200,,2564,4.395789473684211

7614335,3,B01AYDOI1O,"The 5th Wave is a disaster flick in which Earth is invaded by aliens who hover their enormous spacecraft over the planet and methodically begin to exterminate its human population. Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) has to avoid being killed while desperately searching for her missing brother, Sam (Zackary Arthur).

The cleverest aspect of the screenplay is the several stages of the invasion. Initially, an electromagnetic wave shuts down the power. Then earthquakes and tidal waves destroy cities, a deadly virus kills many of the survivors, snipers pick off others, and eventually   a la Invasion of the Body Snatchers  aliens inhabit human bodies to make themselves indistinguishable from normal humans.

The early scenes set the viewer up for quite an adventure to follow, with impressive special effects. Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesnt live up to its spectacular beginning. The 5th Wave becomes a Divergent series wannabe, with teen agers attempting to save the world. Director J. Blakeson resorts to many doomsday cliches and never allows the characters to emerge as more than types. Since we don't know a lot about them, we have little invested in their survival. A romantic-triangle subplot is completely unnecessary and merely gets in the way of the main plot.

Ms. Moretz does an effective job as a courageous young woman forced to deal with an extraordinary situation and the CGI effects deliver some neat visual moments, but these are not enough to shore up a derivative film that relies on elements of successful franchises.

The Blu-ray release contains deleted scenes, the featurettes The 5th Wave Survival Guide and Training Squad 53: Creating a New World, cast gag reel, commentary with director J. Blakeson and Chloe Grace Moretz, and a behind-the-scenes making-of documentary.",1462233600,18,1812,5.249134948096886
7614336,4,B01AYDOI1O,"Turns out what we thought was the end of the world wasn't. Cassie (Moretz) is an ordinary high schooler. Her and her family are living life peacefully until one day, out of nowhere, an alien spacecraft shows up above her house. Little by little they begin to attack the planet systematically destroying what they want. When the unthinkable happens Cassie and her brother are separated. She is now on a mission to get back to him, and when she meets Evan (Roe) he offers help, but she was told not to trust anyone. This is yet another young-adult-teen-save-the-world type movie along the lines of The Hunger Games and Divergent. It may have been the fact that I don't think we need anymore movies like that but I wasn't really looking forward to this. Unlike the other series like this this one grabbed me right away. It did slow down in some parts but really I thought this was exciting and was very much into this. I didn't know much about the book series and actually wasn't even sure if this was a single book or not. That aside I really enjoyed this and for the first time in a series like this I actually am looking forward to seeing the rest of the movies. Overall, exciting and tense.

I want a movie to engage me enough to transport me somewhere else.  This one did that,  well enough.
  I see some really negative comments here,  but,  generally,  I ignore those when they appear to be written by someone full of self absorption.
I don't expect every movie to be extraordinary,  just...entertaining.

This thing starts with all the impact and awe of a huge blockbuster, showing off flamboyant disaster effects to rival the biggest films ever made. But its all downhill from there as the characters have little to do in this uninspired story of alien invasion. The characters, twists and world are all so bland. All the mystery and suspense is gradually wrenched from the story. The rotten cherry on top is the film ending with one of the weakest sequences ever. By the time the story suddenly ends, the viewer realizes that they were being played the entire time, since this was but the first half-baked entry in an epic setup for a massive franchise.

I kept skipping to where there was action and there was a lot of skipping and not a lot of action.  It's OK at the beginning, sort of a rip off of other movies.  But the middle really drags.  It picks up a little after that but you can forget big money effects when battling aliens.  Really, there are TV shows with more action and big dollar effects than this thing.",1459123200,3,666,4.10077519379845
7614346,3,B01AYDOI1O,"If you're looking to waste time, this movie will do.

Like many who would watch ""The 5th Wave"", I'm a Sci-Fi fanatic. For the duration of a film or TV show, I can suspend reality and immerse myself into a something that defies reality -- and that's the point, escaping from our mundane realities. That said, I need at least SOME basis in plausible fact to latch on to. The paucity of those facts makes ""The 5th Wave"" a 2-3 star movie. It lacks a center.

The heroine, ""Chloe Grace Moretz"", does as much as any actor can to supply at least a little bit of gravitas to a premise that otherwise flails about in search of an answer to a malformed question. Going in, you know this is a movie where you will need to check your skepticism at the door. Whenever a group of teens are tasked with saving humanity you understand, up front, that a suspension of reality will be required to make it to the end. To her credit, Moretz is the only thing that makes this movie watchable -- not because she's cute as a button, but rather because she should be taken seriously as a talented actor with a bright future ahead of her, if she so chooses. She literally, all by herself, puts this movie on her back and carries it from a 1-star, home-brew production to a 2.5-star (I rounded up) ""just maybe in an alternate reality"" low-budget, Independence Day knock-off.

The science is absurd. The ""tactics"" are ridiculous. The premise is preposterous. That said, after a few beers, what we have here is a watchable production that will kill off a couple of hours of otherwise useless time. There were, admittedly, a few times where I just wanted to walk off an bid farewell, but Moretz gave just enough to make me want to see it to the end -- which is disappointing, to say the least. I presume the studio did this to leave the door open for a sequel, which I doubt will ever happen.",1459036800,10,1863,4.378612716763006

Second, below is my opinion.
The special effects are gripping i.e. the scene where the plane falls out of the sky.

There are a couple of interesting twists I do not expect i.e.  the scene related to the female lead character in the first 15 minutes.

The acting is engaging. There is some character development related to love.

I have never read the books but I loved the movie so much when we saw it in theaters I came home and bought the book right away. There are scenes that are very predictable but over all there was only one that was corny enough to make me roll my eyes.  I cant wait for it to come out on dvd.,1456272000,4,358,3.7733333333333334
7614353,1,B01AYDOI1O,"One star, which is generous. More plot holes than I can list. Why did they choose to make this movie?",1455667200,4,101,4.1
7614354,1,B01AYDOI1O,"I had high expectations for this movie, but boy did it disappoint.  In the very first scene, the lead character Cassie encounters a man sitting on the floor of a back room in a convenience store.  Both of them point guns at each other and demand that the other lower their weapon.  The man makes the mistake of putting his gun down.  Cassie sees that he has his other hand under his jacket and asks him to show her his other hand.  He very slowly starts to pull his hand out, but she sees something shiny that she thinks is a gun and opens fire.  The shiny object turns out to be a cross made of metal.  So basically, she killed someone unnecessarily because she is trigger happy.  To add insult to injury, she doesn't even seem bothered by what she did.  I'm sure this scene was placed at the beginning to establish that their lead character was a ""tough girl"".  Unfortunately, because of this scene she comes across as being cold and unlikable.

There is another female character that we meet later at a military base and she is given the same ""tough girl"" treatment by the producers of this movie.  She goes around being bossy and yelling at everyone, but she only succeeds at being highly annoying.  In addition to this, there is no emotion in this movie as the reaction of the characters to what is going on around them is way too subdued and unrealistic.

This movie is poorly written and poorly directed and I would not recommend that anybody waste their money on it.  I especially do not recommend this movie for men because it is so full of feminism gone awry.  I found the movie to be insulting and the worst flick I have seen in a long time.  I wish I could get my money back and erase my memory of seeing it!",1455580800,12,1720,4.325
7614355,3,B01AYDOI1O,"The Good:
The movie does a good job of showing the progressive transition of what a post-apocalyptic event would look like. Unlike other natural disaster movies like 2012 or Day After Tomorrow, this film doesn't waste a lot of time in depicting the level of urgency and danger. Chlo Grace Moretz does an excellent job of playing the main lead protagonist. She was able to maintain a sense of balance between strength and vulnerability; reminding us that she's still a teenager thrown into a really dangerous situation.

The Bad:
This may just be own personal bias, but I didn't care too much for the romantic element involved. At this point, given this genre of movies, it seems like the teenage love triangle is just run its course into the ground. The ""romances"" just don't see very organic or they come off as forced.

Unfortunately the trailer does give away a minor spoiler with one of the character's identity. It may have been slightly predictable but if you pay attention to the trailer it makes it robs the surprise even more. The movie tried to be mysterious with certain plot twists, but for the most part it was fairly predictable.

The Reason:
This ultimately ended up being a mix of both Divergent and War of the Worlds. The first half of the movie definitely shows a lot of promise, but then it quickly begins to go downhill. Maybe fans of the books would enjoy this, but I think this is a movie that you can either wait to watch at home or pass on entirely. If you liked movies like the Hunger Games or Divergent then this film falls right in the middle of them. There's just very little about it that will leave you with a lasting impression or even wanting to see more if a sequel were come out.

The Rating: 6.5/10

7614357,3,B01AYDOI1O,"""Survive the alien invasion"" is always a good one. It's been done lits of times, lots of ways, and still has plenty of room for growth. This one, coming in stages leaves plenty of room for great drama. And, that big old plot twist keeps things interesting.

A few things dragged it down for me. Like the horrible infestation magically cured by teenage love - it's been done, but never well. The teen/kid power fantasy thing was liveable, except that the leading lady kept putting her foot in plot holes (like that burning cigarette: it's a clue, numb-nut!) And finding love in the apocalypse - I suppose there's a demographic that drools for such things, but managed to keep my drool under control.

As a teen date movie, it might fly. Too bad there's no way to confine it to that market.

7614359,4,B01AYDOI1O,"This is an alien attack film combined with a kids save the world movie. It centers on Cassie and not Katniss (Chlo Grace Moretz) who keeps a journal for first person narration so we can get the heavy meaningful themes, recapped at the end of the feature in case you missed the point. 40 minutes into the film, we cover the first three waves of the attack and Cassie's high school crush. The fourth and fifth wave are a bit ambiguous and seem connected, but ""The 4B Wave"" wouldn't sell.

Cassie spends most of the film looking for her brother (Zackary Arthur). If you have seen a film before you quickly realize the twist as we painfully wait an additional 40 minutes for it to manifest itself to the characters. During this time we suffer through long painful dialogue. The ending leads us open for a sequel as this appears to just be a long introduction of characters for a series that could go on ad infinitum. David Vincent knows they're here.

The film is designed to appeal to teens and younger. There is no humor in the film as there was in ""Independence Day."" No colorful characters, except for maybe that one girl (Maika Monroe and not a hot Asian chick) and we didn't get enough of her to carry the film. There was nothing wrong with the performance of Chlo Grace Moretz, other than she had dry lines and couldn't do anything with them. They needed to cut 10-20 minutes out of the film.

We find out Cassie was poorly named for Cassiopeia the beautiful, vain, and boastful queen.  Where is JK Rowling when you need a meaningful name? Ben (Nick Robinson) is another story that would be funny, but they made sure it wasn't.

Kids will love this film more than adults. There is minimal swearing, my understanding is they removed a lot from the book in that regard. No sex or nudity. While there is killing, the graphic scenes are more off screen than on. No religious content during the end of the world. More like a PG-11 than 13.
