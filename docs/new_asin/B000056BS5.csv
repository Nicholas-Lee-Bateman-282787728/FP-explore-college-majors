7931839,5,B000056BS5,"Johnny To directing Sammi Cheung and Andy Lau.  The best romantic comedies in the world right now are coming out of Hong Kong.  Sammi Cheung is a star in Asia, yet most Americans have never heard of her.  Here she plays a girl who's taken advantage of by her boyfriend, her co-workers, her family.  When she gets upset she goes on a cleaning rampage.  The Chinese language seems to have a lot of ""wa"" sounds, and Sammi turns them all into one large whine.  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  It's too damn funny.  Andy Lau plays her no-nonsense boss.  He has no time for romance, just uses hookers.  And then Sammi accidentally starts a workplace rumor about him.  It's a sex farce, and yet also a vulnerable and sweet love story.  This is a brilliant peek into modern Hong Kong.  Romantic and funny.  Johnny To is a master.

This film succeeds, with appropriate casting for the material, good pacing, and laughs, because it's not trying too hard. Some Hong Kong romantic comedies try too hard to be funny and sweet. This one simply is.",1083196800,5,304,4.865384615384615
7931841,5,B000056BS5,"i couldn't believe when the case said it was directed by johnny to...the same director who brought me joy in ' The Mission'???
Andy Lau plays Wah-Siu, a player/top sales manager of an Electronics firm. Sammi Cheng is Cinki, his new assistant, and she finds her Bf cheating on her. She is very weird(emotionally) she's a pure-hearted girl( how many grls have we seen in HK cinema that are *pure hearted*??)Though at first, Wah-Siu finds Cinki a horrible assistant, he eventually recognizes her kindness and work ethic, and becomes friend with her starts to give her advices, to resolve the situation with her bf. Then Fiona arrives and senses that they are spending too much time together so she sets up a little somethin somethin...
Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng, seem to have great chemistry. She is probably the best Andy Lau grl in the business. Sure it's cheesy, weepy, and been made over and over and over, but MilkyWay did a very fine job of direction, so it is very enjoyable.
watch with your friends, gf/bf anyone....i stil think this was one of the best movies of 2000.",1031788800,3,1073,4.682539682539683
7931842,4,B000056BS5,"It could be argued that there has not been an original movie plot since the silent age. Where does that leave us? It leaves us with the realization that it's not the story you tell, but HOW you tell the story. Of course this movie is predictable, it's a romantic comedy. If a suspense or mystery film is predictable then it ceases to to be suspenseful or mysterious. But 99% of romantic comedies end the same way and everybody knows it. The pleasure is in the journey. Your traveling partners on this journey are the dependable Andy Lau and the mesmerizing Sammi Cheng. Ms. Cheng is a wonderful, quirky actress who commands your attention every time she's on the screen, even if she's just sipping a soda through a straw. The writing is crisp and funny. The direction is brought to you by that wonderful duo Johnny To & Wai Ka-fai, who are responsible for some of the best HK movies in recent years, including ""Beyond Hypothermia"" and the gender bending ""Wu Yen"" which also starred Sammi Cheng. If you like romantic comedies, then this is your film.",996624000,8,1049,4.585106382978723
7931843,4,B000056BS5,Although I wish my gf would start cleaning when stressed =) This lighthearted comedy is something worth watching. It is funny to see Andy Lau playing a character who can't ride a bike.,996019200,,184,4.606060606060606
7931844,5,B000056BS5,"This movie was nominated for best HK flick of 2000 along w/ 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' and 'In the mood for love'.  It's a light hearted and charming movie. Sammi Cheng is very cute in this movie and the plot is interesting enough to keep you in suspense until the end.  For those that liked 'C'est La Vie, Mon Cheri', you'll like this movie as well.",988761600,2,355,4.363636363636363
7931845,4,B000056BS5,"This movie involves two people who eventually end up working together.  The office anticts of the coworkers are funny.  Paradoies from Andy Lau's own movie,""Full Throttle"" are funny and hilarious.  Overall a cute and light movie.",985478400,,229,5.305555555555555
7931846,1,B000056BS5,"Firstly the story is sooo bad, it must be worn out after being used about a million times in hong kong films, talk about preictablity the ending is ridiculously blatant. Secondly the preformances, especially of sammi cheng, were so lame they may as well have stuck a piece of cardboard on the screen and had some half wit read out the lines. Finally, u hear about flms in hong kong bein filmed in about ten days, well this was one of those, the director must have just picked up  camera and started filming where he pleased because the backgrounds were so uninspiring and bland. i really urge u to put in a big effort not to watch this film, for example if someone has a gun to ur head and he says u either watch the film or die, well frankly the bullent in the head is more funny and will do much less harm. Here's a question, why can't u put less than one star because this film deserves nothing not even a piece of excrement. This is helpful information hint hint  who ever doen't agree with what i have written e-mail me",982022400,2,1024,4.27319587628866
7931847,5,B000056BS5,"I'm a fan of both Sammi Cheng and Hong Kong movies, so I had to see this movie.  I really liked the movie.  It has romance, comedy, and a great but silly story line.  Andy Lau is the other big name in the film.  He is the playboy office manager and Sammi is the beautiful, but at times amusingly unstable office worker.  Rumors fly around the work place as they are seen leaving a hotel together.  It's not what it seems, but things get out of hand when a co-worker spies on them not knowing the whole story.  Sammi's and Andy's characters seem not to get along at first, but as the movie progresses, they both fall for each other.  The story takes a wierd twist as Sammi is pressured into marrying a young billionaire stud from the states.  Sammi is 'shanghaied' to the states, and here comes Andy to the rescue, but it's too late...she's on the cruise line and it's headed for the open seas.  Will he ever get her back...watch the movie and find out...",980726400,,954,4.308988764044944
