752922,5,6303995780,"I Netflixed this movie simply because I really liked David O. Russell's other work (""I Heart Huckabees,"" ""Three Kings,"" ""Flirting with Disaster"") and it did not disappoint.

The simplest way to describe this movie would be, a descent into The Dysfunctional Family From Hell, or mostly, The Dysfunctional Parents From Hell And Their Unfortunate Son.  The film covers a relatively short span of maybe a week one summer when a college freshman finds himself unexpectedly trapped at home looking after his bedridden mother.  It is a deeply absurd and Kafkaesque world which provides plenty of black black comedy.

Two things really stand out in this movie: 1.  It is never predictable, which kept my attention riveted to the screen, and 2. It always looks and feels ""real.""  That is to say, it never resorts to the usual hooks and cop-outs that most movies rely on: using a more attractive/telegenic cast, prettifying what little nudity and sex there is, having a satisfying/redeeming/uplifting ending wherein the main character ""solves"" a problem or ""learns"" a lesson at film's end, etc.  The sheer level of interpersonal dysfunction is downright surreal, yet Russell captures it all with a chillingly journalistic approach.

Many of the scenes are not easy to watch, but due to their emotional and visual realism it is equally hard NOT to watch them.  Yes there is some mother-son incest but it's not really graphic, the stark emotional violence is what truly disturbs.  Overall a very original and courageous movie...certainly not multiplex fodder!",1137801600,26,1547,5.152
752923,5,6303995780,"Brilliant, powerful, and while there are moments of dark humor, they are few and far between. This is a powerful, compelling drama, and once you get into it, you'll sort of BECOME Ray Aebelli (Jeremy Davies) and you'll appreciate one of the greatest acting performances in history. This isn't just about ""masturabtion and incest."" As another reviewer said, it is about being trapped in a situation you don't want to be in, and being unable to find a way out. When you view the end (which will come with a jump, that's all I'm going to say on the matter so as not to spoil it), pay attention to the metaphor that is used when he falls and....you'll have to watch.",1081382400,12,662,4.479338842975206

752926,5,6303995780,"spanking the monkey has got to be in my top 5 movies of all time. first of all, I have discovered the wonderful alberta watson who plays this role like pierre rampal plays the flute. I totally got absorbed in the strange but touching plot which was by no means unrealistic or ""gross"" as some preferred to describe it. i'm not sure if david o. russell wrote the story as well as directed it. I have yet to find out WHO came up with this crazy yarn, for the majority of the credit should go to the writer. but, oh! alberta! since this movie I have grabbed up everything she has worked in. spanking the monkey was surprising, sexy, depressing,funny, thought-provoking, and I just can't come up with enough kudos for this award-winning work. I have only seen it on tv re-runs. I have yet to see the uncut video.oh, and jeremy ain't bad either.the foreplay between ray and ""mom"" is quirky, then suspicious, then anticipating, then bam! it cleverly and obligingly left the rest to the imagination to ponder... and boy, did I ponder! and i'm no lover of incest, but... it was great the way russell built the viewer ""into"" the film as if you were in the room with the characters, they were so good.very well acted, directed & produced. a must for any movie lover of any preference.",984096000,5,1273,4.491379310344827
752927,3,6303995780,"There's no denying that David O. Russell is one of Hollywoods most talented young writer/directors, a fact that's obvious by his first film.  Spanking the Monkey is a good movie, by no means his best (see Three Kings), one worth checking but stands less on it's own that it does as a measuring stick for Russell, showing his evolution into possibly one of the greats of the early twenty-first century.  Jeremy Davies stars as an aspiring doctor who ran off to college not so much to get an education as to get away from his domineering father whom we meet in the first five minutes.  He's lying out strict ground rules for him to follow while caring for his bed-ridden mother.  Expecting to spend the weekend, then fly off to fulfill an intership he quickly discovers differently.  So he ties to make the best of it, persuing a relationship with one of the neighborhood girls with whom he becomes graby and finds himself in an awkward discussion with his mother about.  The two (mother & son) become closely intimant in their time together and Davies finds himself infatuated with her.  It's a dark film, one that tries to blend in it's own kind of comedy but most of it's too offbeat to be widely recongized and even that is practicly non-existant in the second half which drasticly switches gears from comedy to drama.  I don't know if enjoyable is the right word in describing this movie but it will certainly keep you entertained.",971827200,3,1434,4.640316205533597

7858463,2,6303995780,"I first saw scenes from ""Spanking The Monkey"" on YouTube. Then, I heard that YouTube was removing this movie due to ""controversial content."" Well, nothing sells a movie like controversy. I decided to see the movie to  discover what  all the fuss was about. In the end, the praise for ""Monkey"" absolutely baffles me.
  It boggles my mind that anyone could see this movie as a comedy; even a ""dark comedy"" at that; much less an ""entertaining"" one. I'm stunned that anyone would praise writer-director David O. Russell as a ""comic genius."" The characters are much too deeply, disturbingly dysfunctional for their situations to be considered  even remotely funny. The only funny moment occurs when the unraveling protagonist Raymond (Jeremy Davies) tells his aunt to ""do me a favor and shut your big fat mouth for once!"" The only one who deserves praise in this pathetic mess of a movie is Jeremy Davies who,  in an especially brave performance,  at least, manages to make you totally understand Raymond's frustrations and angst.  Davies' achievement is even more remarkable considering that Russell's script is nothing but a bunch of dysfunctional muck.
  Raymond is forced to give up his summer internship at medical school  and, instead, care for his temporarily disabled mother (Alberta Watson). His summer quickly turns into a living nightmare. Raymond is an instantly sympathetic protagonist; possibly because everyone else around him is so horrible. His domineering dad (Benjamin Hendrickson) is a traveling salseman who engages in extra-marital affairs on the road. His mother is lonely, but also selfish and manipulative. Raymond makes fumbling attempts to connect with a neighborhood girl (Carla Gallo),  and his other ""friends"" are all drunk or stoned losers.  Raymond is filled with overwhelming sexual tensions and frustrations. The neighbor girl thinks Raymond is gay, and his friends doubt he gets any sex. This leads to incest, fueled by vodka, painkillers, and tons of hatred and hypocrisy, between Raymond and his mother. Raymond even hisses ""I hate you"" at his mother just prior to a violent mother-son ""encounter.""
  This is definitely not a ""coming of age"" comedy. Instead, it definitely is a coming of rage tragedy. And who can blame Raymond when his rage erupts? There are more scenes of suicide attempts and domestic assaults. Immediately after attempting suicide, Raymond kisses his mother passionately and then practically strangles her to death. Is anybody really laughing? No. You just hope Raymond will escape his toxic environment. Trouble is, any audience member with a brain will want to escape the movie long before Raymond does. ""Controversial content"" does not make this movie provocative or even, for that matter, especially interesting.

Raymond feels a bizarre feeling rising within his southern hedge

7858468,5,6303995780,"After being forced to give up a prestigious internship in order to ""babysit"" his mother, who has a broken leg, a teenager finds himself falling in love with his mother.

Much like ""Happiness"", a black comedy about a pedophile, ""Spanking the Monkey"" is the sort of film that will not appeal to everyone. This film is billed as a black comedy, and I suppose it is, in retrospect, but I didn't feel like I was watching a comedy when I was watching it. What this film is, is a truly amazing character study of a suburban family that contains some laughs but also realizes that a lot of what it's dealing with just shouldn't be laughed at. Writer/director David O. Russell (""Three Kings"", ""I Heart Huckabees"") takes a subject that most people wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole, that is, incest, and explains how it could happen and the consequences if it does happen. The result is a film that feels completely believable and that is also completely compelling.

This is an intelligent film that doesn't provide the audience with easy answers. In fact, a lot of questions that this film raises are left unanswered at the end, like, for example, who did initiate the relationship in the first place, Raymond or his mother? It is also a very restrained film, and all the better for it. Don't expect to see any sex scenes between a 19 year old and a 40 year old. Everything is left to the audience's imagination.

Not being a big David O. Russell fan (I didn't like ""Flirting With Disaster"" or ""I Heart Huckabees""), I almost didn't bother with this film (I only saw it because I bought it as party of a triple pack with two other films that I did want) but I am so glad that I did as this is one of the most incredible films that I have seen in my entire life.

7858469,2,6303995780,"Spanking the Monkey (David O. Russell, 1994)

Spanking the Monkey is a movie that wants to be deep. Russell, it seems, wants to offer some sort of incisive criticism on suburbia wrapped in a weird coming-of-age tale; the problem is that neither branch off this distended stump produces enough of substance to be taken seriously.

Our hero, Ray (Rescue Dawn's Jeremy Davies), is a medical student poised to begin a summer internship. Unfortunately, his plans are interrupted when his mother Susan (Alberta Watson, probably best-known these days for a stint on 24) breaks her leg, and Ray is conscripted into caretaking while his insufferable father (Benjamin Hendrickson of As the World Turns) is away on business. Ray comes home, hooks up with his old drug pals (one of whom is rising star Zak Orth in his first screen appearance), and finds himself smitten with Toni (Superbad's Carla Peck), a high school student from the neighborhood. All of which seems as if it wants to go somewhere. That's all well and good; the problem is that each thread's destination is entirely independent of the destination of the others. That works fine in real life, but this is the movies. There has to be some sort of structure, some defining factor that makes it all come together in some way. Ray isn't a strong enough character to be the linchpin for all this, but that is the role Russell thrusts upon him. Any one of these plots might have made a good movie; twisting two together would have worked well enough. But all combined required either a much stronger script, a much longer movie, or both; no one plot gets enough face time here to assert itself, so we end up with the last scene, which is both completely unbelievable and the only way things could have really worked out. If you've painted yourself into that kind of corner, you should probably consider reworking your script. * , because Russell at least attempted some serious transgression here (even if he ended up having his characters react in textbook manner to all of them).",1184025600,,2031,4.783475783475783
