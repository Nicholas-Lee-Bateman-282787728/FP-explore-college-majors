7741495,5,B01F19W4SA,"This is a wonderful collection of shorts made well over fifty- plus years ago. Most film buffs might consider these shorts are being too old-fashioned and dull, hopelessly uncinematic by today's hyped standards. Rest assured, however, they are important, vital representations how much of the world wanted to be depicted. Each of the 60 shorts are fascinating historical documents. Warner Archives should be commended for releasing these artifacts, instead of throwing them into the trash. I think they will all be recognized as worthy in the future. Not for all tastes, but a treasure trove for the true movie historian.",1463788800,15,621,5.22

7741497,5,B01F19W4SA,FINALLY - I've been catching these wonderful shorts on the TCM channel for years and always hoped some day they would be put into a DVD.

7741503,5,B01F19W4SA,"At long last, the long awaited release of 2 volumes of the great and nostalgic 'Fitzpatrick Traveltalks', and what a wonderful trip down memory lane they are. James A. Fitzpatrick's unique, almost shouting narrative style, somehow suits to a tee, and to see so many wonderful places from all over the world, and most couldn't be seen like this now, they'd have changed so much, so these little gems are quite important historically as well, and all in glorious Technicolor. So far I'm looking at volume one, and I can't wait to purchase volume two. A real treat for the armchair traveller.
Now, if only WB would give the same treatment to all those wonderful old 'Pete Smith Specialties' I'd be in nostalgia heaven! Top marks WB.",1473897600,2,729,4.748031496062992
7741504,4,B01F19W4SA,"Great chance to see the world as it was (or maybe should have been), before WWII engulfed it.  FitzPatrick makes a surprising number of observations about the value of peace...  I highly recommend this feast of color shorts for anyone wanting a trip back in time.  Very wide assortment of destinations, including many interesting and obscure places in the US.",1473811200,,359,4.95

Wow. I have been longing for a collection of Travel Talks for ages.",1469923200,2,140,4.035714285714286
7741507,5,B01F19W4SA,Excellent - Looking forward to vol. 2.,1469404800,2,38,4.571428571428571
7741508,5,B01F19W4SA,"The early 1933-1938 episodes are most interesting as many of the locations no longer under
colonial rule and the political & territorial boundaries have long since changed.
There is not content directly related to WW2. I'm hoping for a second Volume from Warner Archives.",1468627200,3,271,5.181818181818182
7741509,5,B01F19W4SA,"Great, expecting volume 2, 3 and 4.

7741510,5,B01F19W4SA,"In his 1972 book The Great Movie Shorts, Leonard Maltin dismissed the entirety of the Fitzpatrick TravelTalks series as ""boring."" At that time, of course, they had become so rare that there was no way to assess his opinion.
But as soon as these travelogues started showing up as filler on Turner Classic Movies, enough time had gone by - and the world had changed in so many ways - that it was apparent Fitzpatrick's shorts were actually Technicolor windows into the past like no others.
A lot of what you will see here is now gone - including lifestyles - but from time to time you will see city landmarks and structures that have not changed much over the decades.
Fitzpatrick's rather old-fashioned style of narration might not play well with some but for me it's part of the shorts' charm.
It's true that Fitzpatrick stays resolutely away (with minor exceptions) from the politics of the countries he visits. Perhaps one finds this an omission, but Fitzpatrick felt that if he hadn't remained polite with his hosts, he wouldn't have gotten the films. And we wouldn't have these treasures. Yes, treasures.
In my view, this package makes for great, fascinating entertainment.",1468454400,8,1177,4.8316831683168315
7741511,3,B01F19W4SA,"Several  of these  shorts  had already been released as  extras on  feature  films from  Warner's. They are still  only a minor  part of cinema history .You are only likely to watch them once. I remember  some audiences  used to  groan whenever these shorts were shown..Maybe it was Fitzpatrick's narration/voice that used to turn people off  at the time? Personally I preferred the British LOOK  AT  LIFE  series. They were far superior and had better narration .I am still waiting for  20th Century Fox to release on dvd, all those great cinemascope  shorts from the  fifties.",1467676800,2,578,4.894736842105263
7741512,5,B01F19W4SA,"I am one of those incessant TCM viewers who live for many of the wonderful shorts produced for theater consumption between the feature films from the 1930's to 1950's. The series include Crime Does Not Pay, the Pete Smith Shorts, and the Fitzpatrick Traveltalks. This set contains some of the Traveltalks, about sixty of them.
While they are unfortunately not a complete set, they are arranged in chronological order. They serve as interesting pieces of history reflecting not only the times in which they were made but also the culture and people they portray. Many people do not appreciate these gems at least on the surface. My husband scoffs at Robert Benchley's humor in some of the shorts and views actor  Dave O'Brien as sort of a buffoon. As far as the Traveltalks go, he used to make smarmy comments about them being amateurish until he caught one on St. Louis (not included in this set as I recall) and now admits they are fascinating because so many of these places have changed that we have visited. In the narratives a lot of emphasis is put on traditions and cultures as well as a way of life that probably no longer exist or are necessarily remembered.
I have only gotten into the first five hours of these shorts, but I find them informative and fun. It is easy to get caught up in whatever geographic area is visited. The general quality is pretty good given that I am certain these weren't considered keepers by the studio. What is nice is they are now available to new audiences 70-80+ years after they were first made. I hope another set will be released soon.",1465689600,2,1580,4.602836879432624
7741513,5,B01F19W4SA,"What a pleasant surprise to open this set -- ordered May 18, 2016 from Deep Discount via Amazon's Marketplace rather than Amazon directly -- and discover DUAL-LAYERED (gold) PRESSED DVDs rather than the standard DVD-Rs that Warner Archive often uses for its releases. Thankfully they've been increasing their use of proper DVDs, especially in collections and individual titles predicted to be big sellers, but finding this information online is often a Herculean task, especially when the Warner Archive rarely provides it even on their own site, let alone to secondary retailers, so purchasing sets like this or the Forbidden Hollywood collections is often something of a crapshoot unless you buy them early in the run (which then decreases you chances of saving a few bucks getting them on sale later on).

The TravelTalks -- particularly the Lush Technicolor versions that fill this set -- have their devoted fans, myself included, who've subsisted on the meager morsels doled out by Warner as bonus features on various DVDs of classic films over the years, so having a full SIXTY of them in one set is manna from heaven. Having them available on pressed DVDs ensures I'll be buying the next two volumes for sure. I can't assume, however, that pressed discs are available from all retailers as I've heard reports that Amazon itself, for example, burns their own ""on-demand"" Warner Archive discs when fulfilling orders (I welcome those who can correct me on this), and indeed the TravelTalks listing here does claim that the set comes on DVD-Rs. Just something to keep in mind in case you're the type who prefers discs that are likely to have a considerably longer shelf life.

One thing to keep in mind: the Warner Archive eventually STOPS producing pressed DVDs for sets like these and reverts to DVD-R media. I'm not sure how long it takes, but for reference, some of the more recent Forbidden Hollywood sets, for example, can still be purchased with pressed discs in the case, but eventually they'll run out. As I write this,mthe TravelTalks has barely been on the market a month, so buyers should still have plenty of time to source a good set. Just make sure to do your research and find out which online retailers are supplied direct from the Archive. My recommendation, obviously, is Deep Discount, which as of this writing sells this set via Amazon's Marketplace and is apparently supplied direct from Warner Archive thus having access to sets with pressed discs. Ordering from Amazon directly will most likely get you a set with burned DVD-Rs as per the disclaimer near the top of the product page.",1465344000,22,2610,4.916099773242631
7741514,5,B01F19W4SA,"For some people in todays day and age, they may say that these videos seem rather old and outdated,
but to older folks like me who grew up in the late 1930's and thru the 1940's and into the 1950's these
videos bring back memories of when we went to the movies and would see a movie and a short news reel
and a cartoon and a Fitzpatrick Travel Talks film.  I view Fitzpatrick's Travel Talks today as a kind of
living history book that shows us a way of life that is no more. Thank you for making these wonderful
films available once more.  I look forward to a volume 2 release in the future.",1464393600,9,591,4.086206896551724
7741515,5,B01F19W4SA,"I requested this release on their Facebook page nearly 4 years ago and they said they were working on it then.  This set is far from complete, but it does have 60 of those wonderful color travel shorts from the 1930s through the 1950s (volume 1 covers some but not all the releases from 1934-1945).  I wish they would have just given us everything in release date order, as I find the pre World War II shorts the most interesting from a historic standpoint (perhaps that's WA's thinking so they wanted to save some of these for future volumes).

8759930,5,B01F19W4SA,Love the classic stuff. When things were so different,1537833600,,53,5.0
8759931,5,B01F19W4SA,"A huge variety of travelogs in the old style, including bombastic narration almost worthy of W.C Fields, each presented in nine minutes of beautiful Technicolor. 186 short subjects total (inlcuding two somewhat longer pieces) in the three volumes, with three 2.5 hour discs per volume.

Because of squeezing 2.5 hours onto each disc, the video quality is definitely only standard def, but the subject matter will soon have you ignoring that; plus, the color is still gorgeous after all these years.

The attitudes from the 1930s and 40s are fascinating to view through modern eyes. Europeans and Americans are presented either as ""modern"" or in terms of traditional festivals and costumes, while other peoples are presented as exotics benefitting from colonial rule. Threats of totalitarianism prior to WWII are blissfully ignored.

Besides enjoying the visual experience of another era, it can be interesting to look up some of the locations on Google Earth to see how they have changed.",1532995200,,988,5.20125786163522

8759934,5,B01F19W4SA,"I've been watching these on TCM for years. They're great! They produced 226 of these shorts from 1930-1954. The best thing about them is that you get to see these countries at a time when the culture of each country was distinguishable and before they were spoiled by overdevelopment. When I saw that they were out on dvd, I bought all three volumes. Volumes 1 and 2 contain 60 shorts each and volume 3 has 66, for a total of 186. As anyone who's viewed these can tell you, the color is as amazing as when they were first released in theaters. I am curious to know why they stopped at volume 3. There are still 40 of these shorts left, buried somewhere in their vaults.",1515542400,,669,4.317460317460317

8759939,4,B01F19W4SA,"While the first few traveltalks here (made in 1934) are dull and uninteresting, the series soon improves its technique and becomes an enjoyable visit to many foreign places as they were before WWII. The technicolor improves after a dozen or so shorts as does the camerawork. I soon became hooked and bought all three volumes. You get almost 24 hours of nostalgic travelogs that were shown in movie theaters for decades. Don't expect National Geographic quality shorts; the simplicity and brevity of these are part of their charm. Seeing old Europe before the disastrous World War is a treat. May not interest the younger crowd, but I found these simple little shorts to be enjoyable. And I did learn a lot! Transfers are pretty good.",1489190400,2,733,4.872
