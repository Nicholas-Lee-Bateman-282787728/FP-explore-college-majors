8347836,3,B001XW7IG8,I did find this was a hard/good workout.  My trouble is the some of the step routine is hard to follow and pick up. Will keep using this DVD and I'm sure I will finally pick up the steps.,1487376000,,187,3.7948717948717947
8347837,1,B001XW7IG8,I didn't like it because she moves entirely too fast to teach the moves.  Its just down right inconsiderate.  That's my take on it,1391558400,,130,4.375
8347838,4,B001XW7IG8,"This is a fun step and weights workout, however, it has a flaw in middle (more about that later). The step portion with warmup and cool-down is around 42 minutes. It is medium complex. I found that I could follow most of it the first time through until I got to combo #3. Instead of teaching add-on style, she jumps right into the finished routine. The same happens with combo #4. This is clearly an editing error because the first two combos are tought slowly and are in contrast to this. She also makes references to previous moves that don't exist. If you do this DVD a few times you would get it down but it takes you by surprise the first time. There is also a lot of twisting and even though I have no problems with my knees, this workout makes them hurt. The music is ok, but not as good as in some of her other DVDs.
The strength portion is about 20 minutes long and includes a quick stretch. It is short and very fast paced. To make it effective, heavier weights are needed, but you better know what you need quickly, because there is no time to get them. The stretch was too short and rushed for my taste, but overall, I liked it and it gave me a complete workout in about 62 minutes. It also includes several premixes, one of them is cardio & weights intervals which is a great option.",1253836800,2,1296,4.229838709677419
