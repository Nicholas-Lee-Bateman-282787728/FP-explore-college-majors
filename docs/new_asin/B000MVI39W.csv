Like many Americans, Shakespeare was assassinated for me in high school. I have since learned to appreciate the Bard's work through experiences at our local theatre. Seeing this story put the back story of Shakespeare in place.

This is the story of the troupe of actors who traveled with Shakespeare as he wrote plays. It humanized them, and gave me a context for the period and his work. I would say this belongs in every high school curriculum that includes Shakespeare, but there is overt homosexual themes in it, which may be problematic in some settings.  Otherwise, incredible!",1331769600,5,728,4.9105691056910565
