8395999,5,B003FJ4PEK,This is absolutely one of my favorite books of all time. I even asked the author if I could use his book on my blog and he agreed that I could use it with limitations; I say this to let you know that I've spent quite a bit of time with this book. I also got the DVD that illustrates some of the chapters with Smith doing the dialogue. I also love the twin book to this one: Meeting God in Holy Places. Both are uplifting and a pleasure to contemplate. They make perfect devotional books.,1413849600,3,487,4.083333333333333

He is one of our very favorite Christian writers and the Cotswolds is one of our very favorite places in England to stay and visit.
