8434281,5,B004LGI76I,"Richard Sachs is an artisan who designs and produces some of the most beautiful and best handling bicycles in the World.  This is an outstanding documentary.  The majority of the video is shot from inside the actual workshop where Richard works.  The camera slowly pans the shop, his bench, tools around a vise, like a still-life in slow-motion. Though there is no dramatic action, you cannot look away even for a second.  Richard's is the only voice heard throughout the documentary.  He explains how he got started, his apprenticing with Witcomb Cycles, and what it is like to strive for perfection while brazing a joint.  He says brazing is a feeling, like a flavor in your mouth and all you can think of when you experience it is that you don't want it to stop. His narrative is like poetry. The cinematography is so breathtaking I became lost in the visuals.  I watched it twice so I could fully absorb Richard Sachs' explanation of what it was like to make bicycle frames for 30 years.",1347580800,,991,4.628571428571429
