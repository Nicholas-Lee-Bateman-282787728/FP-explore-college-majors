4473201,4,B004UXVDVS,"I watched this series in entirity off of my dvr, UNFORTUNATELY before I was able to see this episode (the season finale), my dvr broke which left me highly upset.

4473280,5,B004UXVDVS,This was one of my first thriller tv shows. I love it. I am so disappointed they cancelled this one. I really hope another network would bring it back. It kept you guessing the whole time. It is absolutely one of the best shows I have every seen.,1389139200,2,246,4.145833333333333
4473281,3,B004UXVDVS,"But unlike other ABC Family dramas, this one falls a little flat. Maybe it is the lead actress who is forced to play two wildly different roles, or the actors cast as the parents who don't quite live up to their believability, but this one isn't as good as the rest of ABC Family's roster.",1373068800,,289,4.2727272727272725
4473282,5,B004UXVDVS,"good book ty for the reading and will order again

4473285,5,B004UXVDVS,HMM what a suprise Abc family still didn't release the Lying Game season one dvd but it is a great show I watched the 1st couple of episodes but then my dvr broke and I missed the rest come on Abc family release it soon!!,1362960000,,221,3.933333333333333
4473316,5,B004UXVDVS,"I don't watch Pretty Little Liars, but I happened to see the pilot of this show and was immediately hooked.  The setting, the fashion, the mystery, and the wonderful cast keep me engaged in every thread of the storyline.  I don't normally watch much TV, but this is a cross between a soap opera, a teen drama, and a mystery that just works really well.  The show nicely intertwines the problems of the teens and the parents into a tangled web of deceipt. I love this show, I hope it comes out on DVD. I also want more episodes in season 2 if anyone is listening.",1360540800,,562,4.283018867924528
4473317,5,B004UXVDVS,I hope this show is put on DVD. I am disappointed that it isn't. I look the show and the books even though both are almost completely dissimilar. I hope more people stumble upon this hidden television gem. The mystery...the suspense...I love it all.,1358553600,,249,4.681818181818182
4473318,5,B004UXVDVS,"To be honest, I didn't even know about this show. The only program I watched on abc family was Pretty Little Liars. When I was scheduling my DVR to record PLL I accidentally scheduled The Lying Game as well. After watching the season 2 premier I decided to go back and watch season 1. I have to say, I LOVE THIS SHOW! Alexandra Chando, playing the dual roles of twin sisters Sutton & Emma is amazing. She makes you feel like these are two different people. You really love Emma and totally despise Sutton. Most of the supporting cast works here and the addition of Charisma Carpenter (she'll always be Cordelia to me)as the amazingly evil Rebecca Sewell completely works. No spoilers here. If you love Pretty Little Liars then give this show a chance. You'll love it.",1358467200,4,767,4.565217391304348
4473319,5,B004UXVDVS,"I started watching Pretty Little Liars and fell in love with the show. Then I heard someone talking about how The Lying Game was better, which I found hard to believe, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I have to say, it definitely surpasses Pretty Little Liars. I think fans of that show will love this one. The show is about two twin girls who were separated at birth and find one another. Sutton got adopted by the Mercer family who dotes on her and treats her really well (turning her into a spoiled brat) while her sister Emma has bounced between foster families, never knowing what it's like to be accepted and loved. Emma's character is extremely likable and easy to relate to. She and Sutton end up switching places so that Sutton can go on a search for there birth mother. Meanwhile, Emma is pretending to be her and really improving her grades, her relationship with her family, and her life in general. She eventually ends up falling for Sutton's boyfriend who falls for her in return. But then Sutton returns and wants her life back, making things very complicated. Watch one episode and you'll be hooked. Trust me!",1358380800,5,1126,4.551724137931035
4473320,5,B004UXVDVS,"This is a great show please release the First then the Second season out on DVD!
This show is just as good as Pretty Little Liers!!",1358208000,,131,4.076923076923077
4473321,5,B004UXVDVS,wish the whole series would come out on video bc this show is awesome n didn't get to see the first one so got it and i liked it,1354752000,,128,3.4482758620689653
4473322,4,B004UXVDVS,"There were two new series of TV shows last season about twins changing places, a common theme from long past. These shows were the Lying Game, for younger adults and teens, and ""Ringer"". Although both were entertaining, the Lying Game was the best in my opinion. In the Lying Game, the twins do not initially know each other exists because of adoption at birth. They both do not know each other or their birth parents, and begin to wonder when they become teenagers, because the parents do not tell them anything except that their birth mother is dead. Some plot twists in this show is that one twin was adopted by well-off parrents, twin Sutton, while the otheer ends up in the Los Vegas foster home system, Emma, and gos through 12 foster homes, prior to the series commencement.  Sutton starts to look for the twins real mother, but finds Emma first. The twins decide to switch places with Emma taking over Suttons's life, while Sutton continues to look for their birth mother. After the switch, the entertaining hyjinks begin.",1342483200,,1030,4.722222222222222
4473323,4,B004UXVDVS,"I heard that an actor who played twins in a soap opera actually got paid for each character.

OK, so my excuse is that I watch this show with my daughter =:)  Even the song: ""Gun for a Tongue"" by Butterfly Boucher draws you in.  Then there is the cast.  Pros like Helen Slater and Adrian Pasdar.  Less not forget my favorite bare mid-drifted hottie from ""Angel"", Charisma Carpenter!

Done in a serial format, this show keeps you wanting more!

While the shows are different, ""The Lying Game"" reminds me of another guilty pleasure, ""Hell Cats"".  Attractive cast, kicking soundtrack and enough of a plot to keep you tuning in.  The difference being that ""The Lying Game"" will get a season 2!",1337472000,,689,4.581967213114754
4473324,5,B004UXVDVS,"I love this show and I am waiting with bated breath for this DVD to finally become available for pre order!!
I love the books and I'm still waiting to see what happened to Sutton. But the show is so different from the books, yet it's still so fun to watch. It's a completely different story, so I can watch the show and read the books and nothing gets spoiled. Love the whole Emma, Ethan, Sutton, Thayer square that's formed and can't wait to see how things play out in Season 2!",1334880000,7,479,4.217391304347826
