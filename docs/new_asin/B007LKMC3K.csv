8519391,3,B007LKMC3K,These kind the videos have more value as reference if you need to study a ballet you need a good look at style and choreography. More than a video to enjoy dancing I will recommended for ballet teachers and stagers more than a casual ballet lover,1392422400,2,246,4.369565217391305
8519392,5,B007LKMC3K,"It would be pointless to overindulge in the description of this DVD - it's best said succinctly. All of these Soviet artists are absolutely stunning - Yuri Soloviev, Alla Sizova, Alla Osipenko, Galina Ulanova, Nikolai Fadeyechev, Raisa Struchkova, Mikhail Lavrovksy, Ekaterina Maximova, Maris Leipa, Nina Timofeyeva, Maya Plisetskaya, and Vladimir Vasiliev, along with the corps de ballet of both the Kirov and Bolshoi Ballets. The music is played and recorded wonderfully, and considering the time of recording, the black-and-white video is excellent. The Stone Flower excerpt (featuring the first act) is the best video I think I've ever seen of this ballet, and the other excerpts are exquisite in their own sense - Swan Lake for its delicacy and romance, Cinderella for its youth, Giselle for its beautiful tragedy, Gayaneh for its oriental-style excitement, and Don Quixote for its sheer bravura, power, and joy. It goes without saying that this is a must-have for balletomanes and collectors, and perhaps one of the first DVDs that should be seen when being introduced to ballet.",1340409600,14,1085,5.277456647398844
