8343274,5,6305680434,Great movie!! Look inside the pimps and hos lives.  Loved it.  Definite buy.,1010361600,,76,4.769230769230769
8343275,5,6305680434,"This film is the perfect compliment to American Pimp, the fine Hughes Brothers documentary. The pimps featured here are extremely compelling to listen to...and you can't take your eyes off of them.
Get this and American Pimp. Both will give you a balanced outlook on The Game. I'm sure your minds are full of negative images and opinions on Pimps. So watch it anyways. If you hate Pimps, you'll still hate them afterwards...but you just may understand afterwards. And that's what it's all about.",979948800,5,495,4.904761904761905
8343276,4,6305680434,"This movie has to be one of the oddest documentaries I have ever seen. The film focuses on the relationships between pimps and ho's, the lifestyles, the amazingly flamboyant outfits and jewelry the pimps wear, and of course  the annual pimp awards!  It was a strange reminder of the worlds that exist  in a seemingly normal city. There was also an interesting cameo by Ice T.  It was a blast to watch!",961977600,,401,4.527777777777778
8343277,3,6305680434,This little documentry here is sorta nice some females in it and the focus on the pimps can get boring at times but this is a good video to watch. Ice tea also makes his pimp appreance but if your looking for a tape full of  females try Luke Freakshow vol 3,961977600,,257,3.9423076923076925
8343278,3,6305680434,"I saw this one when it was on HBO.  I watched as pimps strutted like peacocks in tacky pimpadelic clothing, bragging about their high reputations.  I also watched as they treated their prostitutes as if they  were farm animals to be owned.  It was disgusting, but it informed me that  such people actually exist.  Just when I got into my womens' lib mode, they  pull out a female pimp who I just wanted to slap. Good documentary except  that I felt that it didn't go in depth into the lives of the  prostitutes.
By the way... since when did Ice T become a pimp?",947980800,10,561,4.3173076923076925
8343279,4,6305680434,"I rented this film the other day at my local video rental store because I liked the title, Pimps Up, Hos Down.  The box was an added bonus, showcasing a pimp flanked by two hos kneeling at his sides with a plain  white background. I couldn't resist the poetry of the title or the metaphor  of the box cover art...the pimp and hos operating in their own insular and  exclusionary world...the spiritual vacuum of their lives symbolized by an  empty white background, the emptiness of their lives expressed to all  would-be-renters as subtle as a pistol whipping. The picture's title  clearly articulated the theme of the documentary in simple, urban  vernacular and I had to see it.  If anything, it had to be better than  Night Shift, with Shelly Long, Henry Winkler, and Michael Keaton.  Pimps  Up, Hos Down, much of it filmed as recently as 1997, has a surprising  amount to say, although after one viewing I wasn't sure whether it was a  documentary or a comedy.  The box calls it a Pimpumentary, whatever that  means, but I think its all real. If you've ever seen I'm Gonna Git You  Sucka, this movie seems to suggest that some of that film's satirical jabs  at 70s blaxploitation flics actually happen. (Pimp of the Year?)Very, very  scary. Anyway, its a must see for anyone interested in African American  subculture, Women's Studies, or Economics. You can learn a lot from a pimp.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars, because even though Ice-T was in it, neither  Dolomite or The Mac was.",946512000,16,1486,4.6130268199233715
