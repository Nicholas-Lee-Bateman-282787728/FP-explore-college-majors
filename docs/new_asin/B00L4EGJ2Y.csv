6464699,5,B00L4EGJ2Y,A must-see for anyone who loves films and how they get made ...,1412985600,,63,3.923076923076923
6464700,5,B00L4EGJ2Y,"This is another great documentary from the folks at First Run Features on the movie industry. It ranks nearly as high the one titled Directors: Life Behind the Camera (which wins over this one only because the amazing amount of bonus interviews) and Tales from the Script (about screen writers. All this are MUST SEE DVDs for anyone interested in the movies.
This 89 minute film  made in 2013 could be subtitled The Marion Dougherty Story because  while her name isn't even on the front cover  she is the central character here. Both Dougherty  who was a Casting Director (youll learn more on the word  Director as you watch the film) for over 50 years until she was fired  and Lynn Stalmaster (he is a male, contrary to his first name) are the legends in the business, but even Stalmaster defers to Dougherty when it comes to longevity in the business.  There are five or six other CDs interviewed but they are all disciples of Dougherty and worked for here at one time or another .
The A-list of celebrities that Director Tom Donahue got for interviews is truly amazing. Name an actor (DiNiro, Pacino, Bette Midler, John Travolta and they are here. There are earlier interviews (from another source I guess) from Dustin Hoffman (Dougherty cast Hoffman for The Graduate and paired him with Jon Voight for Midnight Cowboy).  She started in TV and the clips with celebrities from the Kraft Theater and Naked City are wonderful to see.

I could go on and on about this film, but you get the idea. If you love movies this is for you. Sadly, unlike the Directors DVD, there are no special features here or outtakes. But whats included is prime stuff.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Artiste' Marion Dougherty & the difference great casting could make to a TV show or theatrical film.  All the difference in the world...  Can you imagine ""Midnight Cowboy"" w/out Dustin Hoffman & Jon Voight?  ""The Graduate"" minus Dustin Hoffman""?  How about ""Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid"" w/other actors playing the leads?  Maybe ""Welcome Back Kotter"" minus Travolta""?  She is given undying recognition by actors & directors alike (except Taylor Hackford-burninhellSOB)  as to her necessity in that world.  Personally, I would have been satisfied w/the extreme love & admiration of all those talented/skilled/productive people of the theater & movies had for me & my accomplishments than grovel for an Oscar or even a credit line.",1424563200,,977,5.591836734693878

In the interest of full disclosure, Marion was my wife's aunt, and we cherish Marion and her memory.  Personal thanks (again) to Tom Donahue, Kate Lacey, and everyone else who played any role in bringing ""Casting By"" to life.  Marion would have said, albeit in more salty language, ""What's the big deal?""  Anyone who knew and loved her knows the answer.  Now many more people will know it as well.",1416787200,2,549,4.860215053763441
