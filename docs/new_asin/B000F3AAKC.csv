8116721,4,B000F3AAKC,"Strawberry Marshmallow vol. 2 is a cute slice of life anime with the 4 girls and Nobue . To me the best episodes in this volume were the sleep over and the festival. In the sleepover you get to see another side of Miu which is very touching and in the festival Miu steals the show when she takes a stab at bartering and selling.
 The series isn't about fast paced burst out laughing wackiness. Its a relaxed paced humorous , cute show. Some people might not like it because of the pacing  , but for myself I liked it.",1287792000,,517,4.16
8116722,4,B000F3AAKC,"School is out for summer and that means Miu is over at Chika's trying to copy her vaction homework and making a general nuisance of herself. She gets even more annoying when she brings a video camera to shoot footage for a project and complains that Nobue and Chika's activities are too boring to film! Most of these episodes just deal with the day-to-day lives of the 4 girls and Nobue as they do things like go grocery shopping, visit the beach, and dress up for a festival, but the richness of the characterization, the great voice acting, and the cuteness factor make this an awesome show.",1162684800,7,593,4.5514018691588785
