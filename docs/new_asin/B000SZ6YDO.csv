8207101,5,B000SZ6YDO,"Speaking about BBJs educational DVD's in general, however reviewing this one because it's my favorite of the lot,

Short of one, I own all his DVDs. Went on a bit of a panic-buy shortly after he passed away with the fear that they might go out of print. So far they haven't (and with on-demand production being what it is today, they may never).

This particular breed of Travis/Atkins/Reed fingerstyle is very distinct. Once you learn the 'formula' of how they arrive at that particular sound, it opens up a whole lotta noise to be made. Busters DVDs help you learn the secrets of how its done.

While these are pretty accessible to anyone at any skill level, beginners, keep your expectations grounded. Buster and guys like him did/do what they did/do because of decades practice of the sort of stuff taught in this DVD. With that said, his DVDs are the best foundation you're ever going to find to eventually have your 'lightbulb moment' with fingerstyle.

Intermediate and even advanced fingerstyle players, there's stuff to be gleaned from most of BBJs DVDs as well.

Strongly recommended.",1394323200,2,1094,4.828877005347594
