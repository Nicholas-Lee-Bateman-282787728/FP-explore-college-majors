8328956,5,B001O2SHL2,"Henry May Long is a gorgeous work of art, impeccably produced and acted, with a script that for me called to mind some of the great dramas by authors such as Emile Zola and Theodore Dreiser, with all of the classic colors of fear and love and guilt and dread and treachery among people more vivid here than anything I've seen in a long time. I found the sadness of it beautiful, and the dishonesty that played into the friendship between the two men gave the story certain aspects of a thriller for me. I loved the feeling I had while watching it, which stayed with me for a long time after. There was something so true about it that it felt almost like being transported to that time in order to eavesdrop and spy on the characters.",1358899200,,733,4.318840579710145
8328957,2,B001O2SHL2,"I searched high and low for a DVD of this movie because the soundtrack was written by one of my favorite modern composers, Max Richter.  Along with his, I am a huge fan of Victorian period pieces, so I crushed to find this video was of substandard quality.  The picture is grainy and the sound of the video sometimes seems out of sync with persons' lips.  The only thing which keeps me from not rating this 1 Star is I still enjoyed the story very much.

I will never buy from this vender again.",1343606400,,495,4.23404255319149
