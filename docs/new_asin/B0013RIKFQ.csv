8390385,5,B0013RIKFQ,"Not an epic zombie film by any means. (Like the Romero pics are) But this has a charm all it's own. It has a great fall-time back drop. Does NOT skip on the gore... Body count is very high... Even for a zombie pic. All the actors are ugly. (One thing I miss in horror movies) Which makes the sex scenes as gross as carnage... If you have never seen this film, you have been missing out for far too long... It is worth just about any price tag you might see... (Well... $30 or less)

This film is also available on DVD and Blu Ray under the title ""FLESH EATER""... However! Please note: VHS version recommended... But I'm a VHS kind of guy... Be weary of the Shriek Show print of the DVD. I have owned that disc twice and the movie skipped in the same spot on both discs...
