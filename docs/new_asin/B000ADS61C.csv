2386104,3,B000ADS61C,"I viewed this film after reading the novel for the third time.  There are some good performances in this film, and it is fairly true to the story line.  However, it changes the story to a trial with flashbacks; there is no trial in the novel.  It captures the story line without capturing the beauty of the novel.
I can accept a film that is different from the novel; they are two different things.  I'm not sure how someone would assess this film without reading the book.  I imagine it would seem very dry.  I enjoyed it because of the performances and KNOWING the novel.",1396742400,,573,4.40952380952381

2386106,4,B000ADS61C,"I just finished the novel a few days ago, and I wanted to wait a little while before watching the film. Tonight, I finished the film too. I had the same reaction to the movie that I did to the book: great sadness. I found Wilder's syntax odd, at times, awkward and a bit obtuse as if he was trying too hard to write a profound and serious novel (it is, after all, a young man's book), but, nonetheless, I found the story compelling and the characters engaging.

The film, through its narration by Brother Juniper, provided the seam that stiched together the missing narrative of the book, but surprisingly, much of the character's dialog was lifted almost verbatim from the book (only the trial was fabricated by the writer/director). The film is beautiful to behold; the costumes, set, and the Spanish landscape (substituting for Peru) were quite beautiful. But what I missed was the Andes - their massiveness permeates the book and the Spanish hills make a poor substitute.

For me, the conclusion of the both the book and film just don't hang together. The charges of heresy and the need to invoke the Inquisition are not forcefully argued by Wilder. I am still hard-pressed to understand why Brother Juniper was charged and, later, destroyed for trying to make sense of a random or pre-ordained tragedy.

Why the film was not more successful eludes me. It is, as I said in the beginning, a mediation, an examination, of life and death, and role of God in directing both. Like ""The Mission"" (also with DeNiro), it's not a movie I'll revisit often. It, and the novel, lacked a necessary cadence to make the journey worth taking again. Recommended.",1380672000,,1649,4.71875
2386107,3,B000ADS61C,"I both loved and hated this movie...I have had to watch it more than once to try to immerse myself into the story line and the characters in the film.  Overall, I appreciated the cinematography, the costumes, etc, but found alot of the acting stale and boring.  I have never really been disappointed with Kathy Bates or the other top billed A listers, but most of the cast in this movie were absolutely dreadful. Some of the better acting came from the lesser known actors such as the girl who played la perichole, the girl who played pepita and the quiet twins, manuel and estabon.

Overall the story line gave alot to ponder and I did appreciate the movie when all was said and done, I am just not used to a sweeping epic that didn't leave me completely satisfied.",1363737600,,766,4.457142857142857
2386108,4,B000ADS61C,"The Bridge of San Luis Rey (2004) is a film that may ward off
many viewers for two reasons, the first being the long-running
time (over 2 hours of film) and the Spanish culture and
historical setting of the plot and narrative which is not
mainstream in USA. Conversely, the effort in the visuals and in
the acting are outstanding, and should attract many viewers.

The era that is depicted (1714 Peru) is extraordinarily well
done, from the  perfectionism  and consistency in the clothes
worm by the aristocracy and/ monarchy, the filming locations
(city sites), and palace interiors shown are fascinating to see
in between the dialog, ( that is logical and well organized.)

The roster of actors here, are world-class, notably Gabriel
Byrne, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Kathy Bates and Samuel
Le Bihan. Fine performances are also delivered by Bobby DeNiro
and Pilar Lpez de Ayala  (playing a theatre actress, a
Perichola.) The performances are excellent.

A strength of this movie, is its ability to transpose the
audience into another space and time, with different social,
religious and economic pressures than what is the case today. As
indicated, the visuals are impeccable and a pleasure to see, in
the traditional line of cinema, with varied emotions in the
acting, comprising a mix of sobriety, euphoria, anger, sadness,
and so on.

On the other hands, the music is discrete and appropriate. An
aspect that deserved more work, is the editing of the movie,
which is on the long-side at 120 mins.

Another aspect that is noticed, is the effort in the director
staying true to the historical record or novel, but for the
audience, some aspects are not entirely understood, such as the
twin brothers who were raised unschooled in Peru, yet are made
central to the plot, which may mystify many viewers.

In sum, this movie indeed has replay value, and may stoke
interest in that era, in Peru and in its history for viewers
wanting to go deeper behind the scenes. A keeper in anyone's
collection.",1359849600,,2004,4.887905604719764
2386109,3,B000ADS61C,The book is great--and the movie tried with great cast costumes and music and it might have been a four had I not read the book. YCNTABBIM  you can never tell a book by its movie.  Still enjoyable  but read the book!!!!,1355529600,,219,4.166666666666667
2386110,4,B000ADS61C,"If you're expecting the flamboyant romance between viceroy Amat and La Perricholi, this is not the one.
The film revolves around the dead of five people and father Juniper's thesis to the inquisition if they were or not worthy of this fate. Then, the movie flashes back and forth to tell you the story of those who perished and the ones who didn't, and that's when La Perricholi and Amat come into place; the real story between the two would never be shown here (and the book is quite the same).
Nevertheless, it's a good movie to watch. Great actors, beautiful photography! Filmed in Spain, not Peru (the buildingsare more magnificent and the mountains are much smaller). Honestly, I enjoyed it very much, maybe not for accuracy, but for the love of the fairytale.",1355443200,,765,4.7164179104477615
2386121,2,B000ADS61C,Beautifully photographed but they simply put the words of the novel's narrator into the various character's mouths. The reult being awkward and clunky dialogue which even good actors couldn't make sound real,1353715200,,207,5.5
2386122,5,B000ADS61C,"This movie is a retelling of Thorton Wilder's book, ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey."" It is a worthy watch, with one caveat.

First, an admission: This movie is not for everyone. Nor is it a good movie for viewing as a family or group -- far too layered! The reviewers who panned this movie were probably expecting something closer to normal movie fare. This is not that. This movie demands intellectual investment and the ability to entertain things not often discussed.

With that said, however, this IS a movie that is valuable for anyone willing to think deeply about often unspoken life issues. For anyone struggling with personal tragedy and/or disappointment, and willing to think critically about it, this is a superior movie. Yes, it has some pacing issues, and the way it envisions the novel is not always perfect, but overall it succeeds admirably. It presents very difficult subject matter in a visually appealing way. It tells the story of another time, transporting the viewer to a different place in order to gain a new perspective on the universal human condition -- the things we struggle with here and now, viewed in transcendent lens.

As the Book of Job says, ""Man is born for trouble as surely as sparks fly upward."" This movie deals with that human reality, tackling head on the question of evil: ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" And, ""How can I accept the good providence of God in the presence of tragedy?""

The big theme of the movie is our human struggle to understand and accept divine Providence: to accept that there is good at work even in our most fearsome or evil circumstance, and that at the end of the day Love will rule over all. English poet William Cowper once wrote, ""Behind a frowning providence, God hides a smiling face."" This movie is a journey to the smile, after encountering the frown. It is a call to endure in the pilgrimage of life, even when it doesn't seem possible or desirable to do so. It is a call to believe, even when the systems of belief turn against us.

The secondary theme of the movie is almost as big as the first: how does a person accept Providence whenever the appointed guardians of faith act in a manner incompatible with divine Love? Brother Juniper, in his impassioned attempt to reveal the Love of God even in the fatal accident at the bridge, runs afoul of church authorities. They do not appreciate his attempt to ""Think the thoughts of God after Him."" So, in his effort to show his parishioners Love in the midst of evil, he encounters more evil -- evil enacted in the name of God, no less!

So, as you can see, this isn't ""easy"" or lite movie-fare. But if you are ready to hear such questions asked, and see them dealt with in a hopeful and faithful manner, then this movie is for you: a visual, intellectual and spiritual treat. You may learn more about life and more about true love.

In the words of the movie, ""Many who have spent a lifetime in passion can tell us less of love than the child that lost a dog yesterday."" So true!

This movie explores the loss, and in the process, shows us something more of love.

Money quote for the movie: ""Either we live by accident and die by accident, or we live by plan and die by plan. Some say that we shall never know and that to the gods we are like the flies that the boys kill on a summer day, and some say, on the contrary, that the very sparrows do not lose a feather that has not been brushed away by the finger of God.""

This movie addresses that mystery not rationally, but existentially. And powerfully.

You'll be a better person for watching it, even if watching it is not completely easy, lol.

Happy viewing!",1350259200,4,3650,4.48868778280543
2386123,2,B000ADS61C,"This movie would have been unintelligible had I not read the book first. So if not understanding what's going on in this film leads you to read Thornton Wilder's 1927 novel, all the better. The book is a masterwork of literature. The film, on the other hand...

Hollywood has tried three times to turn _The Bridge of San Luis Rey_ into a movie. The only thing I can suggest at this point--if anyone wants to try again--is to strip out the period setting & the antiquated Catholicism altogether, and try something ""loosely based on"" or ""inspired by."" That might work... After all, at the core of the narrative are the BIG questions that endure and exist in any time period & locale--even an ultramodern one.

So we either need a total redux here, or...just leave the book alone, and let it stand as a story to be READ, not a movie to be watched. One of the reasons the novel is so highly regarded is the reserved & spare nature of Thornton Wilder's writing. So figure that the trouble comes in attempting to translate that minimalism onto the big screen.

It simply doesn't work.",1346544000,,1078,4.546391752577319
2386124,1,B000ADS61C,"DEFINITELY PUTS YOU TO SLEEP. If you are looking for a super boring plot, sloppy acting, an uninspired cast, horrible music, and a story that will literally put you to sleep this is the movie. I bought it thinking I would be entertained, instead I ended snoring and when I woke up I was mad at having wasted good money to purchase this literal piece of crap.... It's one of those movie that make you wonder why its producers could not find something better to do. What a terrible waste of film! Mediocrity and staleness at its worst. It just goes to show that sometimes you cannot rely on movie trailers to help you decide if a movie is worth watching. Is there a word to describe ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey""? Yes: BARF!",1314230400,,721,4.348148148148148
2386125,5,B000ADS61C,"(Well, she is the director of this wonderful film.)

I never thought to be able to see Thornton Wilder's novel realized adequately in my lifetime.  That it has been done -- and very beautifully -- is a tribute not only to the many gifted artists who contrived it, but to the producers who paid for the attempt.  Such men and women deserve medals.

The film is magnificent to look at, and the actors excellent.  Some may be disenchanted by listening to these tremendously celebrated people in American POP art, with their so-famous American voices; voices which seem intrinsically wrong in an historical context, but all that can be resolved by listening to the film in Spanish.

Like the character in the story, Uncle Pio, I too am strongly attracted to women's beauty -- why bother otherwise with film -- and find to my delight that Pilar Lopez de Ayala who plays La Perichola is as beautiful as legend might wish, and in the same style as the magnificent Eva Green, whom she closely resembles.

Outside of that what need one say?  The Bridge is magnificently costumed and was brilliantly mounted (in Spain) which evokes the vanished magnificence of old Lima.  Interiors are astonishing, exteriors are wondrous.  The story?

A man of sincere and orthodox faith attempts to use scientific methods to not only demonstrate the working of god's intent in a random, fatal accident involving many, but to justify his method.  (Relapsed Roman Catholics may struggle not to fall to their knees and tear their hair.  But...)  The story is not facile, and though it is profound, it is not difficult.  Rather, it is universal.  It is a sublime story, and all I can do here, is encourage people to plunge into the experience, and then get out of the way, quickly, before making a fool of myself.",1253750400,2,1784,4.7435064935064934
2386126,3,B000ADS61C,"Although I appreciate the great stars that were cast in this movie and the tremenous work done with tradional clothing and scenery several centuries ago it did not impress me as much as the book.  I read The Bridge of San Luis Rey in my freshman year in high school and I never forgot the power of it - so I just had to see the movie.  The ending of the movie is really well done, but the mid section was a bit boring.  I would recommend you read the book if you have already seen the movie.  It is much more full of moral values, faith and fate of mankind.",1227744000,2,557,3.990990990990991
2386127,5,B000ADS61C,Saw this Movie when it first came out. I was very young but have not forgotten it. Haven't been able to find it on T.V. so when I saw it here Had to buy it. Very interesting story & Liked the way it was put together. Don't usually like Flashbacks but this was so very well done. Of course most of the actors have become very well known thru the years. Some of my favorites. I highly recommend it. Is one of my very favorites. I've been trying to find some of the pictures I saw as a child. Have found some. Now have a different insight to them because of my age I guess.,1211155200,,570,3.965217391304348
2386128,1,B000ADS61C,"The first boring movie I have ever seen Robert de Niro act in.
This movie has a star cast, but it never gets off the ground. It plods along till is comes to a whimpering end.
Probably because the novella it is based on, is actually (in spite of all the hype surrounding it) forgettable.
It seems the tale is told in order to do a post modernist sort of ""unpacking"" of events in order to arrive at some insight into either evil or the nature of randomness.
In other words, why did the bridge break and did those particular people fell to death. Did they deserve it, and so.
I was left with the puzzle why is this question only asked when a bridge collapse? I mean, why did the chicken die crossing the road?
The whole dull attempt at unraveling, however, is invalidated by the fact that never is the question asked why did the bridge ACTUALLY collapse - was it well maintained? Did a rope snap? Was it a new rope, etc.
Hell, maybe the man in charge of checking the rope was drunk?
Maybe the Lima people never actually did any maintenance on the bridge! Then it is of course not all that metaphysical...
Don't watch this movie. Rather go to sleep. Or read Dostoevsky.",1183161600,3,1165,4.324200913242009
2386129,4,B000ADS61C,"Five people plummet to their graves crossing a suspension bridge in 18th century Peru. WHY did THESE PARTICULAR PEOPLE die is the question? Father Juniper(Gabriel Byrne) has been commissioned by the Spanish Inquisition to determine just that. One thing is certain and only one thing:the five victims all had association with the actress La Perichole.

Based from the Thornton Wilder novel of the same name,Mary McGuckian's screenplay minutely examines the facts in the lives of these five victims. This film IS an inquest, and McGuckian's thorough retelling of Wilder's book is accurately brought to the screen with an intelligent portrayal by an all-star International ensemble of the most well known A-list actors in the world. Special mention,though,has to go to Kathy Bates as the Marquesa. She is a wonder! It is also great to see F.Murray Abraham playing a Salieri-like role that grabbed him his Oscar in AMADEUS.

For SOUNDTRACK LOVERS,the score written and conducted by Lalo Schifrin and The Philharmonia Orchestra is among the best film scores---very LA MANCHA!

Beautifully filmed in Madrid with gorgeous period costumes to boot,THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY is a masterful adaptation of a brilliant Pulitzer Prize winning novel rendered faithfully and rivetingly.",1171152000,4,1271,5.345
2386130,5,B000ADS61C,"I read the book years and years ago, so I can't say if this was a faithful adaptation or not.  It was wonderfully filmed and acted.  Kathy Bates is at her absolute best.  For me, one of the saddest parts of the whole movie was the story of the twins who talked to no one except each other (though I don't think they say anything in the movie), and were so dependent on each other.  When one dies, the other tries to commit suicide.  The story tells the lives of the five people who died when the bridge collapses.",1158019200,,513,4.141414141414141
2386131,3,B000ADS61C,"I loved Thornton Wilder's delicate and moving novel and approached this movie accordingly. By the time I watched it through, I reached a point of exasperation, feeling that so much of it was good or even excellent, yet the pacing suffered and the editing failed to drive the watcher securely along the road to the end. Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel and F. Murray Abraham performed excellently, Byrne in particular. Byrne's ongoing narration does its best to bind the tale together, and his quality of voice enriches this movie, giving it a beauty that persists in my memory. I could only have wished that towards the end he had given us a little more hint of the gathering horror that Brother Juniper must feel at his situation. A horror that will never be allowed a voice.

However, Robert DeNiro was horribly miscast. I am a DeNiro admirer; I have particularly loved his roles in such movies as Awakenings and The Deer Hunter and The Mission. But not here. Whether it is due to the director's reading of the character or his own, he lacked the necessary gravitas to persuade me that he believed in his own identity. He came across as light voiced, dismayingly colloquial, and, perhaps due to the shape of his moustache, perilously close to comical. Even his asking for Brother Juniper's death gave him no depth. John Lynch and Geraldine Chapman fill out their characters amazingly for the shortness of their actual time on screen. Katherine Bates disappointed me a little -- I wanted more heart. Given the nature of the Marquesa, I wanted sloppiness, more piggishness and self-pity from her in the beginning. When Byrne in his overvoice speaks of the tyranny that informs her maternal love, we have only really seen the generosity of that love. Perhaps a little more time to watch her reactions, more time to see her ideas developing on her face, would have aided the realization of the character in full.

 Despite that last comment where I am asking for more rather than less, I wonder if more severe cutting might have helped this film. In visual terms it is beautiful and the details are extremely well realized. I must watch this movie again; I feel that it could have been a truly great film and I feel personally disappointed that it is not.",1147910400,26,2249,4.732142857142857
2386132,1,B000ADS61C,"this movie was silly, boring and poorly done.  The only saving graces were the excellent performance by Robert Deniro playing himself pretending to be Spanish and how admirably it performed as a cure for insomnia.  I managed to stay awake through out the entirety of my viewing but only barely.  My companions were not as unlucky as I was and dozed periodically only to rouse themselves intermittently to wonder if anything had happened.  That's rather a big problem trying to adapt this book; it's not especially action-packed.  Honestly, the book is so much better.  I'm not sure it's possible to capture its essence to display on screen.  It's probably futile to try.",1139875200,,670,4.928571428571429

The photography and costumes in this movie are exquisite and you often feel as if you are indeed looking at a series of the Master's paintings. There are Vermeer moments, and many scenes that would make astonishing still lifes if you freeze the DVD action. But it is all too dense, too thick with brocade and the lives of too many bewigged characters. For the first half of the film, I felt plunged into the alien world of 18th century Peru without enough focus to orient myself. By the second half of the film, I had grasped enough of some of the characters to begin to identify with them and to feel the poignancy of their lives and deaths. But by then, it was too late. I was suffering the tourist's complaint of too much packed into too short a time - if this is Monday, it must be Lima.

They gathered a truly star-studded cast for this film. Except for Kathy Bates and Geraldine Chaplain though, the actors seem a little stiff and out of their element. And in declaiming their lines, some of their words get garbled. That's fatal, because you do need to catch every word that's being said at the outset of this film in order to appreciate what is happening and how the characters are related to each other.

I had read The Bridge as an assignment in high school, but didn't remember it well. This movie presents a student with the opposite of the usual student recourse. Usually, when assigned a ""classic"" to read as homework, a student can fall back on Cliff's Notes, or better yet - go see the movie.

Murray Abraham who generally in such a genuis of an actor. Would the viceroy of Peru really break down into a fit of tears? Another actor I just could not understand in the movie was Robert Deneiro. I just couldn't Goodfellas and Analyze This out of my head to get used to him as a 18th Century Archbishop of Lima. They might as well cast Al Pacino.

This almost always leads me to another ""so what"" or ""that was nice"" movie.  I don't care much for foreign films and hope that sometimes I can still find something of a gem.  Well ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" is a rough gem, but it ends up being something good.  Not great, just good.  The importance of a movie is how you feel at the end, does it make you feel something and think anew without being just another feel-good formula movie.

Half-way through the movie I was becoming annoyed by being unable to sympathize.  Fortunately the movie turned a card and became much better, even though the character performances and ultimate lesson could still have been drawn out better.  This movie attempts to tackle the ultimate human drama, the relationship between God and man.  It does succeed in portraying the universal trials that confront men and women in every age.  It takes a lot of courage to even attempt this, so even when a movie doesn't quite achieve it's goal, I can still appreciate when a director has the courage to run the race.

Nevertheless, the parallels betwee this movie and another De Niro picture ""The Mission"" are too strong.  OK - in ""The Bridge..."" the heroic order resisting evil Catholic worldliness is the Franciscan Order, while in ""The Mission"" it is the Jesuits.  But in both cases, the same theme develops - sinister, worldly, heirarchical Rome vs. well-intentioned, truly-Christian (probably socialist) renegade Order.

Granted that in both movies, broader themes are superimposed on the superficial stories.  In that sense, both movies are about martyrdom.  But, a martyrdom for the Self, rather than for God.

But all this would have been forgivable in ""The Bridge..."" if the acting had been worthwhile.  Sadly, most of the performances were sub-par.  The dialog was far from believable (whatever Lima's idiomatic conversation may have been).  De Niro in particular was noticably off his game.

If this film seems a bit on the static side there is a reason: the tale is a testimony before court by Brother Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) about his investigation into the deaths of five people when the rope bridge of San Luis Rey outside Lima, Peru collapsed.  Brother Juniper stands before the Archbishop of Peru (Robert De Niro) and the Viceroy of Peru (F. Murray Abraham) and poses the question as to whether the incident was an act of God or just a simple accident.

In order to present his case he has researched the lives of the five who died (mentioning those five would ruin the suspense of the story).  We learn about The Marquesa (Kathy Bates) whose daughter has departed for Spain to marry well (the Marquesa is starving for the love of her estranged daughter); the kindhearted Abbess (Geraldine Chaplin) who gives refuge to the unwanted including identical twin men Manuel and Esteban (the mute Mark and Michael Polish) and Pepita (Adriana Dom&iacute;nguez).  We also meet Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel) who serves as a harlequin for the court and raises Camila Villegas AKA La Perichola (Pilar L&oacute;pez de Ayala) who loves the stage and the accoutrements more than she loves Uncle Pio.  Through the kindness of the Abbess,  Pepita is loaned to the Marquesa's household as a surrogate daughter, the twins share their devotion to the court until a tragedy separates them, La Perichola is impregnated by the Viceroy and banned from the city (she raises her little boy, hiding from the world because of her post-partum smallpox disfigurement), and Uncle Pio eventually assumes responsibility of the child out of fatherly love.  Five of these people who are true to love's power cross the fateful bridge.  Brother Juniper is condemned by the Inquisition for his treason and the meaning of the story is revealed.

The cast is heavy on big names and while they make the most out of the stiff script, they never really touch us the way Wilder's novel characters did.  But the trappings of the film are grand and accurately portrayed, the scenery is beautiful, and the costumes are some of the finest period costumes in many a film.  This is one of those films that requires careful concentration from the audience, a willingness to not be disturbed by the at times static proscenium stage feeling of the setting, but the rewards of understanding the message are great.  There are some fine performances here and the film is definitely worth seeing.  It is more demanding than most films - and that is just fine!

8078138,4,B000ADS61C,"RELEASED IN 2004 and directed by Mary McGuckian based on the novel by Thornton Wilder, The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a costume drama taking place in 1714 Peru, with a few scenes in Spain. Five people fall to their deaths in the Andes when an indestructible rope-bridge breaks and Franciscan monk Brother Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) becomes obsessed with the tragedy, collecting personal notes on all the victims and writing a book on his conclusions: Five people, all dying of the same cause at the same instant, cannot be mere coincidence in an understandable human universe. Hes put on trial by the Inquisition (which was running Spain and Peru at the time) for humanly trying to second-guess an Act of God. Robert De Niro plays the prosecuting Archbishop.

The movie flashes back and forth between Junipers trial and the lives of the five before their deaths. The victims are played by Kathy Bates, Harvey Keitel, Adriana Domnguez and Michael Polish. milie Dequenne appears as the daughter of Bates character while Pilar Lpez de Ayala is on hand as a theater actress. Geraldine Chaplin plays the mother nun and F. Murray Abraham appears as the Viceroy of Peru. Dominique Pinon in on hand as a fop while Mark Polish plays the twin brother of one of the victims.

Despite the stellar cast, this film is the furthest thing from a blockbuster. Anyone who wants a blockbuster should turn around and get the phukk out of here (as Ted Nugent would put it, lol). The Bridge of San Luis Rey demands intellectual investment and the willingness to entertain things not often discussed, like those in the book of Job. The movie is a call to endure the pilgrimage of this world even when it doesn't seem possible or desirable to do so. It is a call to persevere in faith even when the systems of belief turn against us and we don't understand.

The secondary theme is just as significant: How do we accept Providence when those in positions of spiritual authority act in a manner incompatible with divine Love? In Brother Junipers attempt to affirm the Love of God in the face of the fatal accident at the bridge, he runs afoul of staunchly legalistic officials. They do not appreciate his attempt to ""Think the thoughts of God after Him."" In attempting to show Love in the midst of evil, Juniper unexpectedly sees more evil, enacted in the name of God, no less!

Since this is a dialogue-driven movie I encourage you to use the subtitles to keep up with the archaic verbiage and keep track of whos who and whats happening. Beyond the heavy themes, the strength of the movie is its great cast, costumes, sets and acting. The film successfully transports you into another space and time with different social, religious and economic pressures than what we know today. The picture is top-of-the-line on these fronts.

Unfortunately, it was shot entirely in Spain and so the mountains are smaller than the Andes and the buildings more magnificent. The storytelling also seems to bog down in places, but that's because this is not a movie based on plot & pace but rather a genuine look at the characters and their loving relationships. It's a revelation about love in its myriad forms: From Kathy Bates' character seeking the love of her daughter to Harvey Keitel's parental love for the actress to the sibling love of the silent twins to the love of God portrayed by the nuns & Juniper to God's love for humanity. CONCLUSION: ""The Bridge at San Luis Rey"" is certainly worthwhile for those who appreciate layered, dialogue-driven dramas with weighty themes. Lastly, if you've ever wanted to suck the fingers of a bodacious babe, this movie's for you!

8078140,5,B000ADS61C,"I love this movie. When I saw it in the menu on a premium channel, I skipped over it many times. Sounded like a war movie title. Finally, I watched it when there wasn't much of anything interesting on. So glad I did. It's a very arduous look at 18th Century Peruvian Catholicism - please don't let that put you off - it's written by Thornton Wilder, and the priest(a central character)is acted beautifully and sensitively by Gabriel Byrne. There are many fine fine performances in this movie. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed. I hate it when people say too much about the plot, so I think I'm done.

8078141,3,B000ADS61C,"Visually stunning- interesting study in human nature.  I have a feeling the book- once required reading- was probably better.
The visuals are beautiful in the movie.  Unfortunately the movie drags and the dialog can be painful and dated.
The actors all seem to fit their parts but Robert Deniro- who I really like, seems to be the only one acting out of the era he is supposed to be living in.
It is like he broke character at certain points also.  Too bad- this movie had promise and some very good stars are in it.",1448928000,,516,4.410526315789474
8078142,3,B000ADS61C,"I once thought about reading the book but a short synposis of it led me to pass. I am not critical of the topic and thought it might be a good movie.

Like a lot of movies that are ""pet projects"" this one suffered from length. Take 20 mins. off and I would have enjoyed it thoroughly. But it was too long. Yes, the character development was good. However, I tire of endless scenes of just nothing happening. You just look at the players as they sit. Its a modern technique I knot but its overdone. This movie was no different.

Who died was not so much on my mind as how they were going to wind down the long windy narrative.

When doing an adaptation of a novel to the screen it is difficult, I must admit, but when its a pet project and the subject matter is not really one that is going to bring folks to the theaters I think you need to prune somewhere.

Stellar scenes:
1. The humiliation which turns into a reverse humiliation.
2. The end scene where the appearance of the actress is nullified by a lying lover.

Steinbeck type story. If you are looking for a happy ending look elsewhere. Its idealistic at best which is why I passed up on the novel.",1447804800,,1156,4.212669683257919
8078143,4,B000ADS61C,"This is, I believe, the third filmic attempt to capture Wilder's short, but intense novel of the same name.  It concerns the collapse of what was thought an indestructible rope bridge in 17th century Peru with five pedestrian victims, initially thought to have no real worldly relations with each other.  A Franciscan monk, Brother Juniper, however, decides five people, all dying of the same cause, at the same instant, simply cannot be mere coincidence in an understandable human universe, and begins collecting personal notes on all the victims, sometimes making social, emotional connections,, sometimes not.  Eventually, he is accused by the Inquisition (which was running Spain and hence Peru at the time) of heresy, basically
humanly trying to second-guess an Act of God, and is burned, standing on the gathered copies of his book, at the stake.
  You may or may not like this film translation by Mary McGuckian, but I was surprised to find the sum effect basically the same as the book""s.  Most of Wilder's written work is like this-we always seem to be headed for some mysterious apocalyptic destiny which in the end is simply, the endurance of love over death and...confusion?  Robert De Niro is good but unwillingly overbearing as the prosecuting archbishop.  Geraldine Chaplin isn't asked for a lot as the Mother Superior and accordingly plays the role down.  Harvey Keitel is believable as the Peruvian Viceroy. the man who couldn't keep the faith at the crux of the human/divine question.
  I once asked my mother, a life-long Protestant, how she could reconcile the faith with something as barbaric as the live burnings the Bible apparently records and even allows.  She replied, quickly but firmly, ""says God will'""
