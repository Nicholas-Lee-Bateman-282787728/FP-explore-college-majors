2618495,3,B000GTJSUS,"This is one of my favorite workouts because it is a challenging routine which moves quickly and can be done in a 35 minute section from the menu. Overall, it has too many rapid twists and turns for me, but most of the movements can be easily modified to do without them. Some of the movements in the cool down seem a bit awkward and I prefer the cooldowns on some other of Kari's videos over this one.",1216166400,,401,4.153846153846154
2618496,5,B000GTJSUS,"This DVD is great fun.  You won't get the routine down the first time, but don't worry, you'll get it after a few times and that's what keeps it from getting boring.  Kari has a great style, she doesn't make you feel like you're the ugly duckling in a pond of models, if you know what I mean.  Her cueing could be better in some spots, but overall all it's good.  Especially once you get used to the routine.  The music is generic upbeat music, so if you don't like exercising to stuff you hear on the radio, you don't have to worry about that.

The DVD is a 55 minute all step workout (55 minutes includes the warm up and cool down).  It has a menu at the front, so if you only want to do a 25 or 30 minute routine, just pick the menu option you want.  The only equipment necessary is an aerobic step.

I am very happy with this DVD, it has quickly become one of my favorites.",1185753600,21,877,4.023121387283237
8134613,5,B000GTJSUS,"I love the heck out of this video!  You have the option to split the workout into a 35 minute session (two to choose from), or a 25 minute session for a quick workout. Or you have the choice of doing the whole 55 minutes. I love the moves and how she breaks them down/transitions them. Which makes it easier to get to the finish line. So fun! Highly recommended!",1486684800,,362,4.171428571428572

8134616,4,B000GTJSUS,"Greetings...
I have done this workout 3 or 4 times now and although I don't have the routine perfect yet this is still a great workout. Get ready to SWEAT!!! If I had to warn you about anything: sometimes Kari doesn't cue well and none of the participants are performing the ""easier"" version (without all the extra turns). I like to learn the basic version 1st before going on to the more advanced turns. That being said this is my 1st Kari Anderson dvd and it will not be my last. Hope this helps you decide.",1331164800,2,509,4.3125
8134617,3,B000GTJSUS,"Kari's video is good, but you need more room than my living room will allow for all the fancy steps.  If you have space and no carpet, then this is the one for you.",1311724800,,164,3.823529411764706
8134618,5,B000GTJSUS,"I love Kari Anderson, and this DVD is great.  I just tried the routine for the first time today.  I loved it.  Did I get it all down?  Not at all.  But I did the whole 55 minutes and got a great workout.  Was a falling all over the step?  Not at all.  Did I get most of it?  Yup.  Was it a mental and physical challange?  Yup.  At the end, I thought, ""I can't wait to try that one again.""  Kari is always fun and positive.  I like the choice of music; it doesn't overpower the workout.

My background in stepping:  I started in 1992 (wow, am I that old?).  I took the last 5 years off from stepping (or any exercise) to have 3 babies, and I started back to exercising 5 weeks ago.  I am 15-20 pounds overweight.  I am not a dancer.  I've never done step classes in a gym - only vidoes at home.  I'd consider myself intermediate.  This DVD is not for beginners to step.  It has helped me that I have done Gin Miller, Kathy Smith, and Keli Roberts, as well as other Kari Anderson step videos, so I am familiar with different kinds of moves, counting, cueing, and terminology.

This work-out is intended to be like dancing on the step.  You spin up and down and face your back to the TV, etc.  If you don't like that style of step, don't get this DVD.

It has a 4 nice options:
doing all 55 minutes
doing a shortened version - parts 1 & 2 only
doign a shortened version - parts 3 & 4 only
doing the quickie - parts 1-4 without ""learning the routine first""
(all options include warm-up, cool down and strecth)

I had a blast!",1268006400,10,1521,4.047297297297297
8134619,2,B000GTJSUS,"I love Kari Anderson. Hot Steps as compared to her other videos should have been called HOT MESS. I actually gave two stars just because it's Kari and her cueing is the best. Too much twirling and dancing. (Yeah, I know that's why it's called HOT STEPS). I didn't consider this a step workout because of the dance moves. I felt like I spent more time not trying to fall on my butt than I did exercising.",1243641600,,403,4.246753246753247
8134620,4,B000GTJSUS,There's nothing wrong with the Kari's workout. Its just that it's super difficult and you have to really put aside some times to memorize the routine. She does some crazy moves and the only problem is that she doesn't use the steps as much as I like.,1243123200,,250,4.340425531914893
8134621,5,B000GTJSUS,"I got this video because I loved Kari Anderson's ""Go"" for beginners and wanted to move up.  It's taking me a while to get all the steps down, but it's coming, and she's really high energy and keeps you moving.  I would like if she had someone in the background doing a modified routine with slightly fewer twists and turns; otherwise I'm very happy with it.  It definitely gets your heart rate up, and even if you don't get it all right it's a great workout.",1238198400,,458,4.3023255813953485
8134622,2,B000GTJSUS,"Don't be fooled by the title. If you're looking for a classic step aerobics workout, keep looking. I'm a former aerobics instructor and a practiced stepper so I'm not easily discouraged by complex routines. It's not that this workout is difficult, but Kari's background is in dance, and this workout is evidence of that. Here it seems she's more concerned with displaying her dance ability than her step ability. It plays more like a dance routine and Kari uses the step as a prop. There's very little actual stepping going on, but there is a whole lot of ponying up and down, knee hopping turns around the step and just plain razzle-dazzle that tries to make up for substance. She's no Gin Miller.",1236211200,15,698,4.682926829268292
