647083,5,6303451551,"This was my first Karen Voight video, and I love it!  I am not a big fan of aerobics (I hate to sweat!), but I really enjoy this routine.  Mostly I like Karen.  She gets me motivated to work hard, even though I have to pull out the towel and turn on the fan. :)  I also love the bodyscultping section.  I can feel the burn, and it's a great all over workout.  I don't do both sections in one session, simply because after aerobics I can't concentrate on more focused moves like weights.  Karen is one of my favorite two instructors, and I would definitely recommend this video.",1019433600,,577,4.238532110091743
647084,1,6303451551,"Agree that this is an excellently  produced video, however, overweight/ beginners stay away from this video. You need the strength and energy of a well trained athlete to keep up with the moves here.",1018483200,3,199,4.852941176470588

7847233,2,6303451551,"I love working out at home and I do workout videos most days of the week. I consider myself reasonably accustomed to following the cues of the people leading the workout and can follow along with pretty much anyone... except Karen Voight. This is unfortunate to me, because I can tell that it would be a great workout if the cues were more specific and the moves easier to follow. The steps change too often and without adequate warning, it goes unnecessarily in too many directions, and it's so dark you can hardly see what they're doing. I really like the general feel of the video and the intensity is great. If you're patient enough, you could try doing this one a few times and learning the routine to where you don't have to rely on cues. If you did, I'm sure you'd get a very nice workout. I just personally get too frustrated when I try.",1300838400,,845,4.388535031847134
7847234,5,6303451551,"When you compare this 1995 video to Karen's newer yoga inspired videos, there is quite a contrast. Karen is still one of the most talented instructors. She adapts her workouts to the changing time and is a leader in the fitness community.

What I love most about Karen's workouts is her instruction style. Her voice is calm, the transitions between exercises are smooth, and when she tells you to push your limits, you know you are going to feel the burn. Once you have mastered the classic ""Karen Moves,"" her videos become easier to follow.

In this workout, you will notice a techno/gym feel. You will need 2-5lb. hand weights or her unique 12 lb. padded weighted bar. It is worth collecting all of Karen's fitness products as other instructors soon copy her and you won't need to buy extra equipment for those videos. The weighted bar is very sturdy and can be unscrewed in the center so it may be used as a 6-lb. bar. I have found myself using this bar in some of the Method videos.

This video is divided into two main sections. The more advanced first 25 minutes warms your muscles and prepares you for the second body sculpting section. On your first viewing, you might have to fast forward through about 5 minutes of various footwork segments or you can adapt your footwork until you learn all the steps. I find this workout would not be suitable for anyone with knee problems, unless they adapted the footwork.

If you can make it through the first half (I fake about 10 minutes of footwork - trust me!), then you will enjoy developing long lean muscles, targeting your butt, firming up your abs and working on your inner thighs in the second and best segment of this video. I love the creative use of the weighted bar. Karen has a good imagination and uses props to help you balance and the bar makes you feel like you are working out in a gym.

I rate this video advanced because of the fast paced beginning and the heavier weight bar. The floor workout is much slower in pace and concentrated to the upper body. If you focus your mind, clear out all distractions, and remind yourself why you are doing this video, it becomes a little easier.

7847235,3,6303451551,"I generally love working out with instructor Karen Voight, but I didn't enjoy this video. First of all, I found Karen's choreography to be very difficult to follow, particularly during the warm-up and aerobic segments. Although she does give excellent instructions on form (using very down-to-earth language), her cuing is less precise: she sometimes fails to indiciate whether to start on the right or left, and she is often late in cueing new movements. During the low-impact aerobic segment--which lasts about 25 minutes--I frequently found myself marching in place because I was unable to keep up with Karen's complex movements, and I eventually fast-forwarded through this section. Admittedly, I often have trouble with complex choreography, so those who regularly engage in these types of workouts might find Karen much easier to follow than I did.

Following the aerobic segment, Karen moves on to strength work. She uses a 12-lb. body bar, but several of her students show modifications using hand weights (plus a chair for support). The toning section begins with approximately 13 minutes of standing work for arms and legs. Karen demostrates traditional moves such as bicep curls and lunges (although she frequently adds a unique twist to the move), and she places a strong emphasis on form rather than repetitions. Karen transitions from the standing work by doing one exercise for the back before moving on to floor work. She starts with several abdominal crunches, still using the body bar, but then she mixes it up a bit by including some additional leg work inbetween exercises for the obliques. Finally, Karen concludes the toning section with several arms exercises performed while lying on the back, for a total of approximately 12 minutes of floor work. At the end of the workout, Karen leads a simple, 5-minute cool-down segment during which she briefly stretches each of the major muscle groups targeted in the workout.

The music for this workout is jazzy and pleasant without being distracting. The lighting is low, utilizing spotlights and colored lights to give an appearance more akin to a disco than to a gym. Although the strength training portion of this video was okay, I would recommend Karen's ""Streamline Fitness"" video instead of this one--it provides a similar toning workout, but instead of aerobics, she includes an excellent, Pilates-like abs workout combined with simple yoga stretches.",1123372800,,2425,5.1994884910485935
7847236,4,6303451551,"Close your eyes to the dated 90s set and workout clothes, deafen your ears a little to the dated music, and you've got yourself a pretty good workout.

The choreography is fairly complex - definitely not for anyone with two left feet - but I found that I picked it up after doing this workout four or five times. But Karen definitely gets my heartrate up during the cardio section - she often utilises large (but controlled) arm movements to increase the intensity.

The strength training section is effective and thorough - I struggle a bit with form during her ""skiing"" moves, but otherwise it's a good solid workout.

Not as inspiring or fun as some of her others, but definitely one I enjoy sweating to.",1112140800,,707,4.595238095238095
