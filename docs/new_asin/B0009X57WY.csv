It is a B movie at best, and Costner must have been 15 when he made it... the picture looks like it's a recent movie.

Also, the movie STINKS!!!

Don't go near this one if you are a Costner fan... it must be an embarrasment to him.  There is no redeeming factor in this movie... It just plain STINKS!",1195344000,,498,3.98989898989899
