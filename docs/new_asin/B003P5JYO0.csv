If Dumping Lisa gets some exposure with the college to the twenty-something crowd, we could be talking Cult Classic!  The cast members enthusiastic energy and witty interactions held my attention throughout the entire movie.  I hope to see more from this group again soon!",1282694400,2,384,4.96875
8461880,4,B003P5JYO0,"I just wanted a comedy to relax too. Nothing heavy. I was able to get my hands on a pre-release copy and was expecting an average/below average flick BUT surprisingly I found myself laughing through many of the scenes. Funny performances, looks great, and a story that keeps a smile on your face. This is why I love indie films - when you get a good one you want to find another.",1280880000,2,379,4.277777777777778
8461881,4,B003P5JYO0,"I saw the movie at the release party. Amazing videography, funny story and great small town appeal. I preordred this as soon as I saw it come out.  This movie should be in a full release nation wide.",1277942400,3,199,4.2368421052631575
