7965763,5,B000069I17,"The cover and plot description for this movie would lead you to think this is a titillating flick about and evening in an attractive woman's apartment which is low on plot and high on visuals.  The fact is that it is a very clever movie with very good acting and witty, insightful dialogue.  The characters are well developed and the viewer develops an empathy with each.  While surprizing, the ending of the movie compromises what happens before and seems out of character with the movie as a whole.  while I appreciate its references and outcome its a little too smoke and mirrors and too much of an abrupt change from the overall film.

Nonetheless, I like the film very much.  I wasn't expecting such a good movie.  I would highly recommend it to others.",1281484800,2,758,4.611940298507463
7965764,4,B000069I17,"Odd satire on voyeurism (?) that has film student Virginia (Maria Rojo) wrapping up her film studies class with a video project that will require another person. She gets former boyfriend Marcelo (Jose Alonso) to come over for a drink and to talk. She plans on using him as an ""experiment"" in the project. She tries to seduce him but he discovers the camera, gets angry and leaves but returns later and agrees to help her. They get naked and have sex for the video project. ""Homework"" takes place on one set and from the angle of Virginia's camera. It's a two-person character study that turns out in the end not to be what it appears at all. The sex is lengthy and explicit and designed to turn you on (it takes place in a hammock) setting up the viewer for the twist at the end. The first part of the film is a tease as to when the clothes come off (especially with Alonso) and when they finally do you feel you are peeping in someones' window. Virginia explains to the camera what her project is supposed to be about and why she's doing it. But the end leaves you feeling that this has been about something different altogether...role reversal? Exhibitionism? Voyeurism? or a woman determined to find herself over and over until she gets it right? I'm not sure but it's well acted by the two leads and one [good] sexy movie.",1046908800,7,1327,4.442622950819672
