8730408,4,B014DMSE1C,"The movies are good. But there are 2 reasons why I can't give this 5 stars.
1. As you might expect, 4 movies on one DVD does mean quality suffers some. But for the price ($5.19 when I bought it) it's still a good deal.
2. Maybe this is partly my fault, but I thought the bonus move in the 2015 version (no longer available) was also in the 2016 version. It is not. The 2015 version picture was the main picture for this item when it showed up in my search so I assumed both versions were the same. So just be aware you are getting 4 movies not 5.",1497484800,,546,3.9279279279279278
