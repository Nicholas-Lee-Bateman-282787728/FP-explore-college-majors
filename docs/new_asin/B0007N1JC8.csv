2220673,5,B0007N1JC8,"I saw this film last night at a special screening. It's mindboggling, but thoroughly enjoyable. It's probably best enjoyed if you have a background in science or engineering, but I think that's more a of a cultural background than a plot essential.

I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum. The story concerns the friendship of two young engineers (Abe and Aaron) living your average suburban life. In their spare time, they dream of creating the next big thing in Aaron's garage. They eventually stumble on to something of immense possibilities, but are unsure of what to do with it. As they begin to exploit the possibilities of their new invention, a rift begins to develop in their friendship.

This film will probably require multiple viewings to figure out exacly what's going on. Many people thought that they ending was bizarre, but it does follow logically if you pick up the clues. The strength of this film is in the two main characters. It's a character-driven plot that happens to be set in a science-fiction story. However, the science is an important part of the film as well. The sci-fi bit is one that's been covered in numerous films and books, but Primer covers it more carefully than any other story I've seen. The science in the film is vague enough to be plausible, which is how sci-fi should be. Too many movies go over the top in their explanations, leaving those in the audience with a technical background laughing out loud.",1097193600,5,1449,4.746031746031746
2220674,4,B0007N1JC8,"I saw this movie at the end of technology convention in Lake Tahoe, NV.  I found this movie to be completely hard to follow and understand.  I would highly recommend people going to see this movie at least 2 times.  The movie completely skips around a lot.  The movie is a science-fiction movie about two people who create a time machine and put it in a storage locker.  This movie boarder-lines on a ""Back To The Future"" wanna-be movie; in that you shouldn't interfere with yourself in the past.",1097020800,3,496,4.52808988764045

2220677,5,B0007N1JC8,"This is one of those thinking movies. Think Inception, but with a more complicated plot-line. I've seen it ~5 times and I kind-of know what happened.

2220680,3,B0007N1JC8,"This review is for the standard DVD of 'Primer' released by New Line Home Video in 2005.

This movie is about as polarizing as it gets. I suspect that most people will either love it or hate it. For that reason I'm averaging it out and giving it 3 stars.

For the record, I did not like it. It is way too confusing and requires way too much thought for not nearly enough pay off. Also, for the record I am a big science fiction fan.

This movie not only requires a lot of thinking, it requires you to do it fast. There is no time to think about what is going on. Therefore, unless you are a total genius, you must rewind parts, sometimes several times. Even then, I have to admit, I didn't really get it. I had to go and read up on it to truly understand what is going on.

RECOMMENDATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: If you are a hardcore science fiction fan who has a lot of knowledge of science, physics in particular, then you will probably love this movie. If you are not well versed in the sciences, then you will most likely hate this movie and probably not watch it till the finish. Once you get lost early on, you have to make the choice to rewind and watch again or just give up.

Kudos to the film makers who did this on such a tiny budget and were willing to take a chance on making a movie that falls well outside the norm.",1511654400,,1321,4.124513618677042

All of the interactions feel wholly naturally, and the environments and situations these men and women find themselves in are realistic and candid, without the forced grit or awkward nature of other movies. This is just a really excellent science fiction film super imposed upon a really excellent, relate-able drama.

It can be fun to try and follow along, watch it again, dream about the sequence of events, or whether or not the sequence is fixed, linear, or even relevant, and what the implications of that might be, but definitely don't forget to stop and appreciate that everyone there is just playing a role, and that they're doing it beautifully.",1502668800,3,768,4.818181818181818

2220689,4,B0007N1JC8,"My first thought in the opening scenes: ""Where did they find an actor with such true intelligence in the face?"". Only at the end I found out it was the script writer/director himself, who, by the way, used to be a software engineer - ha-ha, no wonder! Overall thoughts after seeing the entire film: 1) Interesting, atypical approach to time travel, 2) By look/feel, this is the most realistic sci-fi I've ever seen, which is achieved not through amateur camera work (camera work was actually pretty good) and not through high-tech special effects but through very natural acting, as well as very realistic technology used in the scenes and surroundings (very average looking houses, streets, roads, etc.). 3) The film holds your interest throughout the entire length even though it's very modest visually and relies a lot on the dialogue, 4) It gives you pleasure in a way similar to a puzzle, it teases your brain, provokes thoughts. Piece of advice - pay attention to the names of the people and the types of relationships between them - you will not see these relationships unfold on screen but will find out about them from dialogues of the main characters. This will give you the clues to what actually happened in detail. I am bad with remembering people's names and did not pay much attention to description of people's situations in the dialogues and came to regret it. I got what happened at a high-level (like, I am sure, most people) but need to watch a second time now to write down names and relationships to understand more detail.",1498003200,,1545,4.768656716417911

If you're into Sci Fi and looking to unwind with something exciting, with good pacing, clear character motives and developments that make immediate sense... Check out Project Almanac, Looper, or Edge of Tomorrow. All fantastic films with unique takes on Time Travel.

Save this movie for a time when you're rested, or at least ready to focus and invest some brain power into a dense and layered story. It's more of a old-fashioned foray into Sci Fi. More like something that a modern Jules Verne or H.G. Wells might write. Dense and nuanced with lots of explanation of rules and big words that you may or may not understand without a dictionary.

If you're ready, this is a great film worth more than one watch. It's sure to be a cult classic both for it's technical execution as well as the questions it raises about morality.",1496102400,3,882,4.641025641025641

When at the end of 40 minutes, no one agrees on that basic plot arc, that's a poorly created film that really botched what seems like it could have been a good concept.",1487980800,2,352,4.430769230769231
2220695,3,B0007N1JC8,"Hard to follow, I believe this is a film one gains a better understanding of after watching it more than one time.  The concept is brilliant, however the writer, director, editor were so close to the project that they misjudged how much information should be given to the audience. I hate the term dumping it down as I think this film draws an intelligent viewer and I don't want to insult myself or other viewers, but I had to watch it twice before getting a basic grip on the overlaying time travel storylines.",1485129600,4,512,4.505376344086022
2220696,3,B0007N1JC8,"Too much quasi-imaginary techno speak dominating the film, not enough basic exposition on the main themes. The low budget sound quality made trying to follow an often mumbled or muted (by background noise) story-line difficult, tiring, and annoying. I kept falling asleep, rewinding, and falling asleep again. It's worth a watch if you can overlook the budget restraints (uneven acting, uninventive location shooting, and film quality). That said, the reason to watch is the storyline: looping selves that question the strength of ones core morality with each iteration until the viewer is left with the idea that morality is a faux principle based only on one's current self interest.  I couldn't sit through it again due to the 1 star for the low-budget, school project feel of the production, stiff dialogue, and unnecessarily jumpy editing.

2220701,1,B0007N1JC8,"Frustrating to watch a film where the exposition was so absent that you unexpectedly get to the end of the film and have no clue what just happened. Add in flat acting, boring pacing and lackluster music (and a complete lack of any special effects whatsoever) and there you have it. I actually looked up some sites to help explain what the heck happened in this film, and even after reading those I still don't have any clue what was going on. This is a time-travel story without a cool Delorean but rather involving boring crates in a storage locker, with characters who you can't really associate with at all. I thought initially they might be heading towards a 'body horror' direction with multiple time-jumps but no, instead this film just meanders into a puzzling, dry conclusion that leaves you unsatisfied and mystified at the time wasted.

I suppose if you're into the cerebral side of analyzing time-travel paradoxes you might enjoy this, but budget plenty of time to try to work out the Gordian shoelace knot of this cinematic mess.",1478908800,,1042,4.7569060773480665

With one last effort, I tried again today ... and I only got through about half before I started skipping ahead to end my misery as quickly as possible. It's mainly the unlikable main characters always in their stereotypical white shirts and ties, with their token friend of color (who gets few lines or camera time) ... and their strained dialogue, always trying to sound overly conversational ... and especially all of the technological mumbo jumbo. It all makes for a really annoying experience. The filmmaking warts I can excuse from a low budget production like this, but the story, characters and dialogue have to make up for that. In this case, in my opinion, they do not. If you want to see what Shane Carruth is capable of as a writer/director, I suggest you pass on this ""student effort"" and go right to Upstream Color, which I really enjoyed.",1475884800,3,1027,4.526881720430108

It's a story of very moderate complexity that is deliberately made a hundred times more complicated by deliberately being opaque, hoping we'll confuse opacity for profundity. It doesn't respect me, and that's why I can't respect it. I think a good rule (though one that might not win accolades) is that when the subject matter is complicated, it is all the more imperative that communicators (e.g. movie directors) make it as clear as possible to make up for the inherent complexity of the subject matter. These people did the opposite, and it doubtless convinced many more people that they were looking at a work of genius.

That's all I will give away, but I disagree with the reviews that talk about the stiffness of the characters or the dialogue or what a waste of their time this experience was.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  If you aren't an advanced mathematics super genius, just remember:  The characters themselves understand the premise and machinations, and by trusting the narrative flow, all will be revealed.  I found the interactions between the two main characters to be intelligent and non-sexually intimate.  Their individual intellect(s) function as a unit, and the stages of discovery, then conflict find them retaining that intellectual consistency, while growing more suspicious of each other's motives.  You cannot derive the full meaning of this film with one viewing.  Multiple viewings only make me want to watch one more time.  On a personal note, I have had several friends and acquaintances around this level of intelligence, and the single-minded obsessiveness of the characters is pitch perfect.  Also, the way time travel is portrayed is low tech, but compelling in its own right.  IF time travel turns out to be a possibility, it'll probably look more like this than ""Looper,"" although that movie had its own charms.  Hope this helps.",1468713600,,1385,4.995633187772926

It is so thoroughly complex that even the characters become lost in the uncertainty of events.

Scenes were very discombobulated. It was consistently frustrating and by the end I really had little idea what was going on, how they managed to time travel, affect anything while hibernating in coffins, the significance of the party and who the guy in the hoodie near the end was, what he was doing or what significance his actions had at all.

The video quality was also lacking, but that's less of an issue, and is really to be expected in low budget movies like this.

The sad thing is that I kept hoping it would get better, or at least less confusing. But it didn't.

What's even worse is that having sat through this I thought I'd take a look on IMDB, and try and understand what had just happened. Looking at the plot synopsis, I think this could have a been a great movie - clearly an original idea, with the potential to be great ruined by budget constraints or, more likely, lack of experience...

2220734,3,B0007N1JC8,"Let me first say that I love good sci-fi movies.  I also like thought-provoking movies that make you think.  So this movie would normally be right up my alley.  Unfortunately, its downfall is that it's just too confusing.

The concept of this movie is great.  I also love the fact that it takes an approach that feels very realistic.  The fact that it's a low-budget film, doesn't hurt it at all, in my view.  But I don't think it's ever a good idea to confuse the audience.  There's a difference between a complex plot, and a story that is disjointed.  To me, this movie feels disjointed.

There's a reason many people say that you have to watch this movie multiple times.  This is because the story is told in such a way that you're bound to become confused.  Very few details are ever explained, and you're left with an understanding that contains many gaps and holes.  It's like trying to put together a puzzle without being given all of the pieces.

I don't want to say anything about the plot because the best thing about this movie is the way that it leads you on a curious journey.  ""Cube"" is also like that.  The less you know, the better.  But unlike ""Cube"", which is written in such a way that you can completely follow the story, but still have a sense of exploration as you watch it, this movie gives too little detail about certain aspects.  This may have been on purpose, but it doesn't work well for me.

If you get lost watching this movie, that doesn't necessarily mean that you weren't paying attention.  I think the story is simply told with too few details for you to ever follow it with complete clarity -- even if you watch it more than once.  To me, this is bad story telling.  It's not that the story isn't good, or that it doesn't have a solid plot.  The plot and concept are great.  I even love the approach this movie takes by choosing not to simply spell everything out for you.  But I think they went a little too far with that, and, in the end, it's a bit frustrating.

If you like movies like ""Cube"" and ""Memento"", then you may have some appreciation for this movie.  It does a great job at feeding your curiosity.  Unfortunately, the story isn't told well enough to be as good as the other movies that I've mentioned.  ""Primer"" isn't a movie that I would choose to own, but it also wasn't a complete waste of time.

I suggest that people who rave over this movie are experiencing a sort of Stockholm Syndrome.

 I think that no other time travel movie I have ever seen has the same compelling power of Primer.  This erudite, entertaining and baffling film resembles nothing that I have seen before, which  I like very much.  And now we know the name of Shane Carruth, the movie maker behind this arresting $7,000 movie.  Shane Carruth wrote, directed, produced and stars in this exceptional little film.  His friend David Sullivan co-stars.
 The two leads play a pair of long term friends, engineers, who with another couple of guys, are busy making things in their garage, doing good science and getting patents -all in support of a chance to make the big bucks.  Abe and Arron, the Sullivan and Carruth characters, in a side experiment, discover a way to send themselves backward in time-but only a few hours backward.  They quickly set up a secret time machine and begin to make serious money by using their fore knowledge of the stock market and other money generating events.
 What could possibly go wrong?
 We find out.  The plot has such opacity and murkneyness that I can not say I fully understand what went down, exactly.  But as a watcher I can say that I didn't turn away from the screen for a minute.  This may be best seen on DVD where the viewer can watch it several times to get the full effect.  In any case, this movie has a uniqueness and a vision that we have not seen in the genre before.
 Others like the film as well, not just me.  It garnered four awards from the Sundance Film Festival (2), the Nantucket Film Festival and the prestigious London International Festival of Science Fiction.  And producer Carruth got his and his friends money back to boot.  The box office rant to $425,000, a 60 to one return never mind the later DVD revenue.
 Primer runs a short one hour and 17 minutes and carries an ""PG-13 rating.

""Primer"" has a terrific concept for a movie buried in a film that has little to no narrative momentum, exposition that is so eliptical as to be virtually non-existant and makes more avant-garde films like ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" to actually be an action movie. ""Primer"" provides a perfect example of how not to make a movie compelling, interesting or challenging. Some movies require concentration but, when you have a movie that requires a garmin to find the plot, that's not a good thing.

SPOILERS:

Abe(David Sullivan)and his engineering partner Aaron (Shane Carruth who also wrote an directed the film)have been working with their two friends to create new products in hope of finding that million dollar discovery. Abe comes up with a device that they think alters gravity. Instead, it's a time machine. The two decide that they are going to use it make millions by going back in time with stock tips. Needless to say, things don't turn out that way.

END OF SPOILERS

Where to start? ""Primer"" won lots of awards. It's unconventional narrative wowed some critics so much that they didn't realize the writer and director couldn't tell a story to save his life. The film is a mess with a story that borders on incoherence and that's not because the story is complex or beyond folks--it's because the filmmaking is so disorganized. The first hour moves at a glacial pace.

2220764,5,B0007N1JC8,"The way I explain my appreciation of this movie is this:

You know how, when you are watching a movie and there this complex idea being explained by one very smart person to another very smart person, and although you have no trouble following it, the other very smart person always says, ""What do you mean?"" and the first very smart person then explains the same thing again but at an eighth grade level?  That drives me crazy sometimes.

I was watching this movie for the first time, and one person was explaining something to another in a way that was not easy to grasp.  As the scene went on, I realized, oh wait, they're not reexplaining it for me.  I had to rewind -- rewind, RIGHT!  Showing my age here -- I clicked back to the beginning of the chapter so that I could pay better attention to what they were saying, so that I could actually follow the conversation.

From that moment on, I was watching and listening to this movie with my full attention and with my brain turned ""on"".  Not many movies do that to me.

Additionally, there comes a point in the movie where one character, in the midst of just such a conversation, tells the other... ""Okay, you're going to see something now and you have to NOT FREAK OUT.  Okay?""  Okay, you have my attention again.  And then what happens has you, along with the other character, saying , ""WHAT THE HELL?""  And suddenly you are in the middle of a completely different story.  Now you REALLY  have my attention.  And this is not the only time during the movie when what you thought you understood turns out to be not what you thought at all.

Brilliantly written, and not written ""down"" to the lowest common denominator.  And aside from that, just a fun and fascinating story to watch.",1432944000,4,1738,4.44620253164557

I'm not going to speak much about the plot because the movie should be viewed without knowing much about it at all. See what you catch and what you miss, and then watch it again so that you can change your mind about everything you thought you'd figured out.

Primer is about Aaron and Abe. It starts out slowly as they mess around in a garage trying to build something while not building anything in particular. They stumble upon time travel, completely by accident, but they can only go back a few hours. From there things get sticky, convoluted, full of loops and tricky loopholes.

The film is written and directed by Carruth who also plays Aaron. It's low budget but somehow still unbelievably smart and engrossing. Now, there are a lot of smart films that have been made. Carruth goes a bit of a different route though because he does not hold the viewer's hand. At all. There are things that it would be very hard to figure out while watching the film. The film takes twists and turns and makes no attempt to keep you up to speed. That's up to you, the viewer. The only thing the film seems to work at in terms of the viewer is keeping your eyes glued to the screen because you know something big is happening and you want to know what the heck it is. The only films I've had to dig deeper into on the internet after watching them have been David Lynch films. Shane Carruth is like Lynch in a way, but Lynch if someone reined him in and kept him from being so in love with his own ideas.

This little film left me with some big questions about what I would do if I could rewind, what would I endure until I got things just right, and is that even possible. Theres something that feels creepy, malevolent, and just not right by the time you get to the end of the film. The characters have changed, their world has changed and not just for them.

There are some things I like about it: the little-known-but-good actors, the natural dialogue, the execution of the concept without resorting to special effects or futuristic-looking gadgetry. I didn't even mind that a lot of the engineering talk was over my head; it seems perfectly normal and natural considering the subject matter.

But it gradually lost me with the results of the actual time travel. I was completely confused by the end. But, as I read somewhere, that was Carruth's objective, as the characters themselves are confused, too. Still, they had a much better grasp of what was going on than I did! There were also a few odd plot points. Unless I missed something, the weird event with Thomas Granger was never resolved or even understood.

As their invention grows, they quickly discover that they have stumbled upon a powerful and world-changing technology.

This movie isn't for everybody (my wife wasn't thrilled with it), but I loved it. The dialog is crisp, the acting is good, and the plot will leave you thinking for weeks.  The gags are subtle but really, really funny, all without undercutting the story.

That being said, this movie isn't intended to watch once then move on. I think it was intentional to have the viewer watch repeatedly to discover more about the film than it lets on initially.
""Primer"" is very dialogue heavy and has maybe one special effect. The appeal isn't Guy Pearce fighting morlocks, it's two friends who bite off more than they can chew and find their perceptions and their loves unwinding as a result. For a cerebral and initially confusing cautionary tale on the effects of time travel, ""Primer"" is a must-have in the film repertoire of geeks who like to have their brain exercised.",1410912000,2,751,4.829457364341085

The idea behind it is certainly intriguing but the execution is borderline trash. I'm not going to go into too much detail (others already did),so here's quick run-down of the main things this movie does wrong:

- Visual quality is below average and the budget is no excuse for that. You'd get better quality with a 200$ used DSLR than this non-sense.

- Audio is even worse, horrible mixing (you barely understand the actors at times) and very bad dialogue execution where several people talk over each other. I've been in a lot of discussions about technical stuff (ideas, reviews etc.) in my life and if there's one thing that never happens, it's 4 people talking over each other.

- Writing is plain bad. It's complicated and confusing, taking great care to not explain anything and if some explaining is indeed happening, making sure it is so convoluted that you can't follow.
I know this is on purpose to convey the confusion of the main characters to the viewer but here's the thing - the concept isn't really that complex. The script is complicating things on purpose by leaving out vital information and compressing any attempt of an explanation into a few lines of obscure dialogue.
Not to mention the final ten minutes of a completely detached story-line involving a random birthday party and the two main characters trying to change something about it. We don't get to know what or why but honestly, at this point I didn't even care anymore.

The movie has some great ideas behind it, even some good scenes (well, attempts of good scenes) but the execution is so bad that in the end it's simply a waste of time.",1410652800,5,1822,4.628482972136223

Though its production values are terribly low - the film was made for just $7,000 - Primer's discount visuals actually work well within the context of the story itself. Narrow in scale but not in scope, it hones in on a small team of overworked engineers who discover functional time travel by accident, then set about (naturally) exploiting it to solve their money troubles. The air of intensity and excitement is palpable, with an almost nonstop track of dialog running from start to finish, and that really gives the scene a sense of authenticity. True savants, these guys possess excessively bright minds, and clearly their mouths are struggling to keep up with the volume produced by their brains. It would be easy to get lost in the minutiae of what they're saying and miss the forest for the trees, were the discourse not so insanely fast and heavily loaded. We're dealing with a seriously complicated subject matter, after all, and not even the twin geniuses at its epicenter seem to fully grasp the particulars of what they're living through. Let's put it this way: this isn't the first time I've seen the movie, and I still had to look up a summary afterwards to work out a few of the details. Distinct, intriguing and baffling complex, it's tough to watch without a furrowed brow and the nagging understanding that you're the dumbest person in the room.

The best way to describe it for someone like me would be, watch it if you tend to appreciate movies with a beginning and a middle but an ending that seems like another half hour is missing. The whole down is up and up is down thing gets tiring.

Even in a movie like Groundhog Day, Bill Murray knows what his goal is: to break the loop. If many people found the movie confusing, I'd say the main reason is that even the protagonists (if you can call them that) have no idea what their goals are. They spend the whole movie trying to figure out what they are doing and how it's affecting the people around them. So how can you fault the audience for not knowing what they're dong? You can't.

2220832,2,B0007N1JC8,"It's worth a watch. The film's concept is intriguing and Carruth's
mechanism of time travel is fresh and original. However, the execution
of this film is so sloppy and the plot so tangled, that it renders the
overall experience average at best.

Yes, the sound is a nuisance. There is no proper sound engineer for
this film (considering it was made on such an ultra-low budget), that
it's difficult to truly follow most of the conversations the first time
through. Particularly outside the storage facility when Abe first
introduces Aaron to the possibility of time travel. That was the
moment when the plot started to gain momentum, and it wasn't
impactful in the slightest.

It's not just the sound. It's the pacing. Which I understand is meant
to be a bit muddled in places. But there are many plot points and
questions brought up that aren't even answered adequately or even
remotely touched to be meaningful:

**SPOILER ALERT**

1) Why Rachel's dad would collapse / be comatose as a result of time
travel, when this effect doesn't happen to either Abe or Aaron. And
their reaction to his comatose state is quickly glossed over. It
doesn't even seem to be a motivating factor for the course of the plot,
even though it obviously changes their perception on the safety of what
they're doing. Since this character never talks, you don't even get a
reason for why he would have discovered the box (let alone get inside)
in the first place.

2) The degeneration of their handwriting. I mean, Abe even asks Aaron
at one point why they can't write. Specifically asks. And is given no
answer. Why would they even bring this up? Is this a visual to convey
the literal degeneration of their lives and wellbeing as a result of
time travel? Does this handwriting issue have anything to do with
Aaron's bleeding? It just doesn't go far enough to matter.

3) Attending the party in multiple permutations to ""save"" Rachel.
Firstly, Abe and Aaron don't go to the first party. They hear about it
from their two fellow entrepreneurs. What possesses them to
return to the past to ""correct"" the events of this party where no one
gets hurt? It didn't seem to have any meaningful impact before... and
yet, after the comatose state of Rachel's dad, this party comes to the
forefront again. I don't understand the connection. I've heard that
Aaron wanted to be a hero, but no where do we come to understand how
this fits in with what we've seen of his overall motivations. The
character development regarding Rachel, or even the relationship she
has with Abe, is so ignored and minuscule, that this relationship means
nothing to me.

So in general, I find the editing, pacing, and visual quality of this
film to be muddled and these issues dampen what could have been a
genre-defining moment for this otherwise fresh film.",1400716800,3,2803,4.73155737704918

I admit there is a great deal of dialogue that was either over my head, or i just couldn't hear well. My advice...don't sweat it.
From a sci-fi fan point of view this movie is a great exploration of the consequences of time travel.
Due to it being about time travel, once i realized this, I had to pay attention.

The premise of the time travel was different than I had been exposed to before, and i liked it.
I enjoyed that the movie was done in a way, that for me at least, left me thinking about where the loops started.
I took from the events that we were stepping into the plot at a point after the time experiments began, but that could be because I think linearly.
Overall, if yo can get past the production quality, and what seems like jumping about, but isn't or is depending on how you perceive time travel i think it was well done.

2220856,4,B0007N1JC8,"In a non-descript storage facility in the suburbs sit two mysterious machines, the culmination of a group of friends hard work, of their nights, of their weekends, of as much capital as they could muster. Then they discover something shocking, theyve created time machines.

The question of what do with these machines arises. At first it seems the machines may be commercially valuable, but this proves false. This is when the inventors turn towards using the machines to benefit themselves.

One inventor is conscientious from the beginning, while the other inventor is more adventurous. One inventor is wary of the potential dangers while the other inventor ignores them. They both profess their not wanting to alter the past, but each has a different level of commitment to the subject. They both try to keep the project quiet, under wraps from world, but things easily get out of control amongst themselves. Aghast at their errors, they try to set things right, but since time travel functions according unknown sets of laws different from those of linear time, the concocted logical solutions to their problem end up becoming just additional steps towards disaster.

Supposedly made for only $7000, this film is a marvel. Not only is it a fascinating story, the camera work and the production value are very good. With long scenes, and thoughtful performances by the cast, this quasi Sci-fi/Arthouse film is a visual pleasure to watch. It doesnt screen as a low budget thriller.

While Director/Writer Shane Carruths vision isn't exactly crystal clear, this mystery is part of the charm. For a film about a complex subject like time travel, the success is in Carruths ability to purvey the concept with very little flare. Everything seems to have aligned perfectly here. That is not to say it is the greatest film ever, but for a movie about such complicated subject matter, the bare-bones approach is very interesting. The script and characters talk about what they know. A narrator fills us in on a few more key details. Then the rest we are left to figure out on our own. As a sci-fi thriller this film works very well.

2220866,1,B0007N1JC8,"The movie is very confusing.  At first one might think that some highly intellectual things are going on that one should think about, but in reality the script is a total disaster and makes very little sense.

The writer/director/star's description of how a time machine works is rather unique, though, and the least ""magical"" sounding/least impossible sounding of any story in the time travel genre.  I guess that's cool, but that part is easy to figure out. (Spoiler: device makes loop forward and backward in time from a fixed point that you can ride around on).  Neat idea, and better than the sort of go anywhere, anytime free-flowing concept in most other stories.

The disorderly plot, writer's skimming over key details, etc. are not cool.  You think that this is meant to challenge your intellect.  In reality, you realize it's just bad writing.  Bad, bad, bad.

Case in point--the exposition of the ""critical"" event that the main characters are trying to influence.  They discuss it, but we have no idea what they are talking about until it happens.  It also completely tangential to the rest of the plot.  And and complete change in motivation for the characters.  What I believe happened is that the writer simply got bored with the story he was telling, or he realized that he had some extra time to spare, so he simply switched to a new story line in the last 15 minutes of the movie.  That is really, really poor work.

The time travelers do some ""stuff"" to play the stock market, but one of them talks about as if he is knowledgeable on the topic, but it's clear the writer has no idea how any of this works, and just has him BS his way through the scenes.  (Was there even a script at this point, or did he tell the actor to make up some smart, stock-markety-sounding stuff)?

Speaking of that, the techno-babble is nothing to marvel at.  It's just babble, like in any other sci-fi plot.

I realize this was a very low-budget film, but considering the writer/director/lead was essentially pricing his labor for free, there is no excuse for his not working on making the writing better.  Maybe rehearsing the scenes a bit more (or at all?) would have revealed the problems.  Or, I don't know, storyboarding?  Really basic stuff.  It was clearly thrown together hastily, which is not the fault of the budget at all.

If you talk about this long enough and make all sorts of assumptions that effectively rewrite or supplement the story, you can make perfect sense of it.  I guess that's a fun game for some, so I can understand the movie's appeal in that regard.",1379462400,6,2576,4.646017699115045

2220868,5,B0007N1JC8,"Primer is the most realistic science fiction movie I've ever seen, and hands down the best time travel movie of all time! Many time travel stories depend on invoking either nostalgia for long-passed days or dystopian fear of distant futures. Still others depend on far-fetched occurrences and/or special effects to achieve their goal. Primer, on the other hand, is in a class all its own. To begin with, the time travel destinations are only hours or days removed from the present. This is part of what gives the film its very puzzling quality, as people do not age noticeably nor do environments change drastically within a few days time span. As a result of this, the chronology of the film must be deduced primarily from the behavior, intentions, and dialogue of the characters; behavior which is unpredictable, intentions which evolve as the film moves along, and dialogue which is awesomely scientific. As other reviewers have pointed out, the writer/director/protagonist/composer makes no attempt to dumb down the conceptual framework and overall temporal complexity within which the film operates. Primer is difficult to understand. Whether you are a scientist or a science fiction fan, the first time you watch it you will probably only fully comprehend about half of it. But this, for me, is the film's best quality. The urge to rewatch it is immediate due to the fascination invoked by what was not comprehended. At this point I have watched it several times, and each time it makes more sense to me, however I still do not fully comprehend it.

Difficulties aside, Primer is a beautiful film with top-notch cinematography and an amazing score. It is very refreshing to see a science fiction film without the standard barrage of computer-generation and overly-dramatic music. Any ""special effects"" experienced are the result of very well-thought-out shots combined with skillful editing. The music is well-placed, optimistically melancholy, and at the same time invokes an undeniable sense of wonder and possibility. The acting is down-to-earth and believable. The characters portrayed are not superhuman and do not have unlimited resources. The feeling that you get from the film is that you have become a witness to actual extraordinary events. In my opinion there is no other science fiction film (time travel or otherwise) that accomplishes this feat as well as Primer.",1378425600,14,2383,5.1735751295336785

2220870,1,B0007N1JC8,"I am amazed by all the good reviews for this film! I am a huge science fiction fan and love time travel pieces. I also have some experience with independent films, go to several film festivals each year, and try to help support indie filmmakers as much as I can. Upon this film popping up in the amazon suggestions list when trying to find a film to watch with my father (another huge science fiction fan), reading the synopsis, and reading bunches of great reviews I decided to rent it and check this seemingly good indie film out. What I discovered was a crappy indie film that looks like it was made by high school students with no film experience, stoners, or both... an unoriginal storyline, mediocre acting, and a headache. My father fell asleep.

Supposedly the filmmakers had a $7K budget and I see a few reviewers praising the film for its beauty considering their low budget. What?! The film looks grainy, out of focus, and shaky all the way through! That has nothing to do with budget (I have seen much better looking films made for a lot less) and everything to do with someone not knowing what the heck they are doing with their camera. I guess you could argue that with their low budget they couldn't afford to hire a cameraman with experience but I say why couldn't they educate themselves for free by reading a few 101 how to use a camera guides via their local library. To make things worse, in editing they seem to have color corrected everything to look either yellow, orange, or green depending on the scene. I am guessing they were trying to be inventive and artsy trying to color code things depending on the emotions they wanted to convey in each part of the film but it just didn't work for me. It looked like bad florescent lighting through and through. Helped build up my headache beautifully though.

Sound is a whole other issue in this film. It is bad! Every characters sounds like they are mumbling through a 1920's radio. Add to this the fact that the characters are all talking over one another and the filmmakers made the music and sound effects tracks substantially louder then the dialog track and you got yourself a confusing film. Not because it is anything great or interesting, not that the plot is so grand in complexness that it is confusing... simply that the film is so badly shot and the sound is so screwed up that you can barley hear or see anything so you have to put on the closed captioning to try to follow along.

Storyline you ask? Unoriginal. ***SPOILERS***  Two guys stumble upon making a time machine, start using it and experimenting with changing the timeline, some crap goes wrong and they start shoving their other selves into nooks and crannies while continuing to mess with the timeline, one of them comes to the realization that maybe they shouldn't be doing this and tries to convince his friend to stop too, his friend claims to move on but in reality starts building a whole new time machine. THE END.

Simplified but accurate.

Yes there is some jumping around and trying to confuse the audience with who is who in the timeline and what is going on but all in all I found the story boring, characters unappealing,and quality appalling. For more interesting stories (films and movies in no particular order) concerning time travel and/or alternate timelines watch: The Twilight Zone, Doctor Who (old or new), Back to the Future, The Time Machine, Planet of the Apes, Quantum Leap, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Star Trek, Time Bandits, Groundhog Day, The Terminator, Army of Darkness, 12 Monkeys, Memento, Butterfly Effect, Austin Powers, Andromeda, Timeline, The Outer Limits, Stargate, The Kid, Fringe, Eureka, Hot Tub Time Machine, Looper, Continuum... the list goes on.

As for Primer in whole... I watched it all the way through, understood its unoriginal storyline even though I'm sure someone will argue with me I didn't, and the only thing confusing to me after finishing the film is why so many people seem to like it so much. Don't waste your time or money.",1377907200,10,4038,4.68688293370945
2220871,1,B0007N1JC8,"Normally, I'd preface this type of review with a bold ""SPOILER ALERT"", but I suspect those who've yet to see this film couldn't make sense of the spoilers anyway. I'm not sure one can really ""spoil"" such a convoluted plot even if they tried.

I'd like to give this film 5-stars for its originality and a very creative concept in the best tradition of Arthur C. Clarke (as noted is a few other reviews), but a lot of that creativity was lost on a plot that became too obtuse and burdensome for its own good -- which is why I have to give it a 1-star.  I like films that are intellectually challenging but prefer not to have my brain fried during the experience. And that's the quandary I had with ""Primer"", it was too smart and too film-school artsy for it's own good; it's one ripping science fiction yarn that kinda went off into the film festival weeds with way more abstraction than what was needed to tell a relatively simple, but good, story.

The main stumbling block for me:  the plot could've been greatly simplified without losing its appeal. The audience really deserves a few more clues and guideposts along the way to make the cinematic journey that much more enjoyable without sacrificing artistic creativity or the intended meaning of the film. As any good writer knows, stay out of the way of a good idea and let the words flow naturally -- don't embellish, don't add unnecessary artifices for the sake of appearing ""artistic""!

On the plus-side, I enjoyed the style and texture of the film from a geeky-person's point of view; the scripting was so natural I thought I was watching a historical documentary. No CGI, no special effects of any kind (although that levitation machine they build in their garage was kind of cool). You don't need a lot of zap-bang-boom-pow effects, battling mega-robots, mindless car chases with somersaulting SUV's, naked body-doubles performing simulated sex to keep people's attention when you have a GOOD STORY to tell!

On the minus side: the plot had WAY TOO MANY versions of Aaron, Abe, boxes and fail-safe boxes to keep track of without the aid of a spreadsheet. What the story lacked was just enough continuity to hold the plot together long enough for people to figure out what was going on. I eventually figured out most of it -- except for the the final scene in the ""warehouse"". Frankly, I think there were points in the film where the writer/director/actor wasn't entirely sure what was going on.

It seems clear to me (after multiple viewings) that the ""beginning"" of the film really wasn't the beginning at all given that the first rendition of Abe was, in fact, a time traveler who made the first trip in the machine and traveled back six hours to inform his partner, Aaron (sitting on the park bench) that the trip was successful. He proved it buy taking Aaron to the storage facility where we see the ""original"" Abe returning to the machine after leaving the hotel.  After that, things got real complicated to the point where we have not one but THREE Aarons running around -- ""hoodie"" Aaron, ""original"" Aaron locked up in an attic and rendition #2 Aaron.  Now add in another version of Abe to the mix along with two ""fail safe"" machines and you have a real mess.  Oh, and don't forget, these time machines are portable -- you can fold one up and take with you back to the past.  Enough, already!!!!!!

Which brings us to the brief final scene: one of the Aarons splits from one of the Abe's at the airport and ends up in this big warehouse directing some sort of activity, presumably building a larger version of the time machine. Many commentators & reviewers saw no special significance in this scene, but I thought it was a rather odd way to end the movie, especially given the low budget -- why shoot unnecessary footage?  And what was with the French-speaking dude directing that crowd of hard-hatted works in the warehouse?

I now believe the entire movie was intended to depict a corrupted time line from the get-go and the Aaron we saw in the warehouse was, in fact, the original Aaron (as opposed to the Aaron locked in the attic).  If you have a better idea, please let me know.",1377648000,12,4152,4.614654002713705

This movie is enjoyable and really thought provoking. So why did I give it only four stars?? Only because it seems to drag on at different times in the story that cause it tough to re-watch.

The story is of a group of individuals, which inevitably becomes two friends who design a machine which allows time travel. The difficulty that they face, is how to make themselves stop repeating the cycle.

The struggles of time travel have been recognized for years. They stem from beliefs that it is possible through worm holes, if someone can first survive in the volatile environment. The problem of course is coming into contact with your younger self or changing the tables of time like in back to the future. Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys space-time sci-fi type films!",1371081600,,1170,4.7073170731707314

2220889,4,B0007N1JC8,"This film seems droll at the beginning if you are not paying attention, but it is most likely the hardest plot you have ever tried to follow. The shell and ball game has been used as a comparison, but I think that is too oversimplified. You have to watch this film four or five times just to get a handle on its complexity, and even then you will still need to look up timelines that others have made to understand. A very intriguing and captivating film done on a shoe string budget. If you like to think until your brain bleeds during a film, this is for you!",1369612800,,561,4.203703703703703
2220890,5,B0007N1JC8,"I think I have found that the magic number of viewings for Primer is two. One is most certainly not enough, because, well, watch the movie and I am sure you will agree.

Three/four/five (up to five is where I stopped) is too many because then you get caught in your own loop of trying to ""figure things out"" and you end up losing sight of the beauty and simplicity of the story, the acting, directing, cinematography, etc.

It is quite possible that upon more than five viewings something changes again and you become one with the movie and move into a transcendental state or something but I am not sure I can chance it. It is also equally possible that I would end up a raving lunatic making infographics and timelines and posting them on Tumblr.

I could not watch this film to completion. The unbelievably obtuse dialogue that went *no where!* in the first 20 minutes took in one side and out the other. I simply did not care. The ""conversations"" these four have cut off trains of thought and leave you hanging. How they got anything done I don't know.  I've worked in labs with people who are certainly more intelligent than i am (my IQ is 153) and NEVER have I heard people interrupting each other and losing trains of thought like the morons in this movie. I honestly do not care where the film went after those 20 minutes, because I was already at a new movie about time travel that was far more satisfying and, actually, believable.

I started to notice things the third and fourth times. Then the FIFTH time, things started to come together. I have now seen the movie fifteen times and I really think I have a (near) perfect understanding of the movie.

I spent a long time mapping out all of the different timelines involved in this movie, and how everything fits together nicely. For those trying to grasp the plot, here you go (spoilers):

Timeline 1 (not shown in movie)

Monday:

Before 8:30am Abe0 sets a timer for fail-safe A and goes back home to sleep. It later turns on and no one exits. Aaron0 has cereal for breakfast and then goes to the park bench.

8:30am Abe0 sets a timer on box A and then leaves for the hotel.

8:45am Box A turns on and no one exits.

After ~9:00am Aaron0 leaves the park bench and most likely goes to work.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe0 drives to, stays in, and returns from a hotel in Russell Field. He calls his mutual fund company to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe0 enters box A and disappears. He will emerge in Timeline 2 as Abe1.

After 3:15pm Rachel calls Abe0 but he doesn't answer. No one ever sees Abe again.

Timeline 2 (not shown in movie)

Monday:

Before 8:30am Abe0 sets timer for fail-safe A and goes back home to sleep. It later turns on and no one exits.

Aaron0 has cereal for breakfast and then goes to the park bench.

8:30am Abe0 sets a 15 minute timer on box A and leaves for the hotel.

8:45am Box A turns on and Abe1 exits. At some point, he buys the stocks that he had heard from his mutual fund company would do well. He takes a taxi to the park, approaches Aaron0 at the park bench, and convinces him to not go to work.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe0 drives to, stays in, and returns from a hotel in Russell Field. He calls his mutual fund company to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

Aaron0 asks Will to invite his cousin, who is Rachel's ex-boyfriend, to the party.

Abe1 takes Aaron0 to various labs to try and explain why the fungus is growing on the weeble.

Before 3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron0 watch as Abe0 enters the storage unit.

3:15pm  Abe0 enters box A and disappears.

After 3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron0 park their car in a field and discuss time travel and theorize that Aaron0 probably went to work.

Rachel calls Abe1, he answers and invites her to the party.

Evening At the party, Rachel's ex-boyfriend shows up and pulls out a shotgun but he doesn't fire. Abe1 and Aaron0 are not there.

Aaron0 builds box B.

At some later point in time, Aaron0 finds out about what happened at the party and wishes he could have been there to take the shotgun from Rachel's ex-boyfriend and be the hero.

Tuesday:

8:30am Abe1 and Aaron0 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on and no one exits.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron0 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron0 enter the boxes and disappear. They will emerge in Timeline 3 as Abe2 and Aaron1.

After 3:15pm No one ever sees Abe or Aaron again.

Timeline 3 (not shown in movie)

Tuesday:

8:30am Abe1 and Aaron0 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on and Abe2 and Aaron1 exit. They go and buy the stocks that they know will do well.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron0 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

Before 3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron1 watch as Abe1 and Aaron0 enter the storage unit.

3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron0 enter the boxes and disappear.

Wednesday:

8:30am Abe2 and Aaron1 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on and no one exits.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron1 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron1 enter the boxes and disappear. They will emerge in Timeline 4 as Abe3 and Aaron2.

After 3:15pm No one ever sees Abe or Aaron again.

Timeline 4

Wednesday:

8:30am Abe2 and Aaron1 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on and Abe3 and Aaron2 exit. Abe3 tells Aaron2 about a dream he had at the beach. Aaron2 makes a mental note of this dream.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron1 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron1 enter the boxes and disappear.

After Wednesday, probably Thursday or Friday:*

 Aaron2 discovers on the storage manifest that Abe3 has 2 rooms rented under his name. He finds the room and discovers Abe3's secret fail-safe A. He goes and gets box A and box B, folds them up, gets inside fail-safe A with the boxes, and disappears. He will emerge in Timeline 5 as Aaron3. When Aaron2 disappears, Abe3 goes to his fail-safe and realizes that it has been turned off. He also finds that box A and box B are missing. Since there was only one fail-safe, there is no way for Abe3 to go back and catch Aaron2.

 *Since we don't know the exact day that Aaron0 finds the fail-safe, nor the time that Abe0 turns on the fail-safe, we are also unsure as to whether he finds fail-safe A before or after the catastrophe with Rachel which sends Granger back in time to save/see her. If anyone can verify the time that Aaron0 finds the fail-safe or the time that Abe0 turns it on, please email me at tylerfyoung@gmail.com.

Timeline 5

Monday:

Before 8:30am Abe0 sets timer for fail-safe A and goes back home to sleep. It later turns on and Aaron3 exits. He hides fail-safe A in another room for the reason that his double is coming back in it. He takes one of the boxes and makes his own fail-safe (we will call it fail-safe B) and sets a timer. The other box he puts where fail-safe A had been as to deceive Abe1 that it is fail-safe A (we will call this one fail-safe C). He also sets a timer for fail-safe C. Fail-safe B and fail-safe C turn on, and no one exits.

Aaron3 goes to his house in a hooded sweatshirt and puts a sedative in Aaron0's milk. Aaron0 has cereal for breakfast and goes unconscious from the sedative. Aaron3 hides Aaron0 in the attic and then goes to the park bench to wait for Abe1.

8:30am Abe0 sets 15 minute timer on box A and leaves for the hotel.

8:45am Box A turns on, Abe1 exits and takes a taxi to the park. At some point, he buys the stocks that he had heard from his mutual fund company would do well.

Aaron3 begins recording conversations with a hidden tape recorder. He leaves an earpiece in his ear so that people will ask what he is listening to, when in fact he may not be listening to anything.  This way, the next time through when he already has everything recorded and needs the earpiece to reproduce to his recorded conversations, people will have already asked about the earpiece and the conversations will be the same.

Aaron7 goes to the basketball court to have Will invite Rachel's ex-boyfriend to the party.

After 8:45am Abe1 approaches Aaron3 at the park bench and says he is listening to basketball. Abe1 thinks he convinces him to not go to work when Aaron3, in reality, wasn't planning on going to work.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe0 drives to, stays in, and returns from a hotel in Russell Field. He calls his mutual fund company to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

Aaron2 asks Will to invite his cousin, who is Rachel's ex-boyfriend, to the party. During the conversation, he shoots for a basket and makes it in. Abe1 takes Aaron3 to various labs to try and explain why the fungus is growing on the weeble.

Before 3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron3 watch as Abe0 enters the storage unit.

3:15pm Abe0 enters box A and disappears.

After 3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron3 park their car in a field and discuss time travel and theorize that Aaron0 probably went to work the first time through. Rachel calls Abe1; he answers and invites her to the party.

Evening Aaron3 goes to the party. There, Rachel's ex-boyfriend shows up and pulls out a shotgun. Aaron3 attacks him, takes the shotgun from him, and is considered a hero by everyone. Abe1 isn't there.

Aaron3 builds box B.

Tuesday:

8:30am Abe1 and Aaron3 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on and no one exits.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron3 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron3 enter boxes and disappear. They will emerge in Timeline 6 as Abe2 and Aaron4.

After 3:15pm A few days later, Aaron0 breaks out of the attic.

Timeline 6

Tuesday:

8:30am Abe1 and Aaron3 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on, Aaron4 exits first, and then Abe2. In Abe2's perspective it appears that he (Abe2) exited first. This is because time is going backwards when Aaron4 exits so it takes a minute or so for Abe2 to catch up to Aaron4's time.

They then both go and buy the stocks that they know will do well.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron3 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

Before 3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron4 watch as Abe1 and Aaron3 enter the storage unit.

3:15pm Abe1 and Aaron3 enter the boxes and disappear.

Evening Abe2 and Aaron4 talk with Aaron's wife Kara about what she would do with all of the money in the world. Aaron4 mentions how he wants to go punch his boss Platts in the face and then somehow go back and tell himself not to. He can then live with the satisfaction of punching his boss, but not the consequences. Kara is impressed and calls him a hero (alluding to his actions at the party which Aaron4 probably told her about earlier). Kara complains about rats in the attic, not knowing that the noises are actually coming from Aaron0.
Wednesday:

8:30am Abe2 and Aaron4 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on and no one exits.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron4 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron4 go back to the storage unit and enter box A and box B. They will emerge in Timeline 7 as Abe3 and Aaron5.

After 3:15pm A few days later, Aaron0 breaks out of the attic.

Timeline 7

Wednesday:

8:30am Abe2 and Aaron4 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on, Abe3 and Aaron5 exit. Aaron5 knows that Abe3 has just had a dream about the beach because he had told it to him in Timeline 4. For fun, Aaron5 describes Abe3's dream before Abe3 has a chance to tell him about it, as if it was his own. Abe3 reacts by merely adding a few details, but he is obviously a little confused.

After 8:45am Aaron5 has an ear bleed. This is most likely a side effect from so much time traveling. Aaron5 and Abe3 go and buy the stocks that will have the highest gain.

8:45am-3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron4 drive to, stay in, and return from a hotel in Russell Field. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe2 and Aaron4 go back to the storage unit and enter box A and box B. They disappear.

Afternoon/Evening Abe3 finds out about how Aaron5 (at the time, Aaron3) had gone to the party and risked his life to take the shotgun from Rachel's ex-boyfriend. Abe3 is angry because he doesn't think Rachel's life is more important than Kara and Lauren having a father. Aaron5 argues that things are better now, alluding to how his wife thinks more highly of him. (She had called him a hero the night before.)

Thursday:

8:30am Abe3 and Aaron5 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on and no one exits.

8:45am-3:15pm At the hotel, Aaron5 forgets about his cell phone being on and answers it. He tells Kara to save him some dinner because he won't be home in time. While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe3 and Aaron5 enter box A and box B. They will emerge in Timeline 8 as Abe4 and Aaron6.

After 3:15pm A few days later, Aaron0 breaks out of the attic.

Timeline 8

Thursday:

8:30am Abe3 and Aaron5 set 15 minute timers on box A and box B and leave for the hotel.

8:45am Box A and box B turn on, Abe4 and Aaron6 exit. They go to buy the stocks that will have the highest gain.

8:45am-3:15pm While walking down the street, Aaron6 once again forgets about his cell phone and it rings. He doesn't answer this time. Meanwhile at the hotel, Aaron5's cell phone doesn't ring this time around, and Kara never talks to either Aaron. Since Aaron5 doesn't answer the phone, this ""breaks symmetry"". Abe4 is worried and Aaron6 pretends to be worried, but since this affects nothing, they decide that causality isn't as dangerous as they thought.

While in Russell Field they go to the library to find out which stocks had the highest gain that day.

3:15pm Abe3 and Aaron5 enter box A and box B. They disappear.

Afternoon  Aaron6 sees Granger0 clean-shaven.

5:00pm Abe4 sets 15 minute timers on box A and box B.

5:15pm Box A and box B turn on, no one exits.

Friday (not shown in movie and very theoretical):

2:00am Some kids are hitting cars and setting off car alarms. This wakes up Abe4. He goes to Aaron6's house and tells him how they should now go punch Platts. This way they could go get in the boxes, become Abe5 and Aaron7, and go back and stop the kids from waking Abe4 up. Abe4 would then never have the idea to punch Platts, he would never tell Aaron6, and then they would get in the boxes as planned the next day.

After 2:00am Abe4 and Aaron6 go to Platts' house and Aaron6 punches him in the face.

Rachel's ex-boyfriend finds Rachel alone and kills her. Her father, Thomas Granger0 is terribly upset. Abe4 sympathizes with him, and decides to tell him about time travel so he can go back to see his daughter again and prevent the murder. Abe4 doesn't tell Aaron6 in fear that he would be mad at him for divulging time travel to an outside person.

Abe4 and Granger0 enter boxes. They will emerge in Timeline 9 as Abe5 and Granger1.

Timeline 9

Thursday:

Afternoon  Aaron6 sees Granger0 clean-shaven.

5:00pm  Abe4 sets 15 minute timers on box A and box B.

5:15pm Box A and box B turn on, Abe5 and Granger1 exit.

Friday:

2:00am The kids wake up Abe4. He goes to Aaron6's house and tells him how they should go punch Platts.

Abe5 and Granger1 are outside Aaron6's house in Granger1's car. If anyone has a valid theory as to what they are doing outside Aaron6's house, please email me at tylerfyoung@gmail.com I cannot figure this out.

After 2:00am Abe5 gets out of the car and begins running around Aaron6's house. On their way to go to Platts' house, Aaron6 notices Granger1 sitting in his car. He also notices that he now has a 2 or 3-day growth on his beard, while earlier he had seen Granger0 clean-shaven. Abe4 calls Rachel, gets Granger0's number, and calls and verifies that Granger0 is indeed at home. Aaron6 gets upset and starts to chase Granger1. Abe4 goes after them. Granger1 faints from being close to Abe4.

Aaron6 and Abe4 can't figure out how Granger0 found out about time travel.

Abe4 secretly goes to fail-safe C, thinking it is fail-safe A, and goes back in time to reset everything. After Abe4 goes back, Aaron6 follows him in fail-safe B. Abe4 and Aaron6 will emerge in Timeline 10 as Abe6 and Aaron7. Aaron0 and Abe5 remain in this timeline to take the places of Aaron6 and Abe4. While Aaron0 is still locked in the attic, Abe5 goes and saves Rachel.

A few days later, Aaron0 breaks out of the attic.

Timeline 10

Monday:

Before 8:30am Abe0 sets timer for fail-safe A and goes back home to sleep. It later turns on and Aaron3 exits. He hides fail-safe A in another room, takes one of the boxes and makes fail-safe B and sets a timer. The other box he puts where fail-safe A had been and sets a timer for it also. Fail-safe B turns on and Aaron7 exits. Fail-safe C turns on and Abe6 exits.

Aaron3 goes to his house in a hooded sweatshirt and puts a sedative in Aaron0's milk.

Aaron0 has cereal for breakfast and goes unconscious from the sedative.

Aaron3 hides Aaron0 in the attic and is about to go to the park bench to meet Abe1 when Aaron7 attacks him. They fight, but Aaron7 is overtaken. They talk, and Aaron7 convinces Aaron3 that he is unnecessary because he (Aaron7) has already recorded all of the conversations, as Aaron3 was planning on doing. Aaron3 decides to leave, and Aaron7 tells him what he (Aaron7) plans on doing.

Aaron3 leaves and goes into hiding. He records a cassette tape based on what Aaron7 explained to him. Aaron3 plans on giving the tape to Aaron0 when he wakes up in order to help him understand everything that happened while he was knocked out. (Aaron3 is the narrator in the movie.)

Aaron7 goes to the park to wait to meet Abe6.

Abe6 goes to Abe0's house, gases him, and locks him in a closet.

~8:45am Abe6 approaches Aaron7 at the park bench. Aaron7 listens to his recordings and tries to create the same conversation they had in Timeline 5. Abe6 faints from shock/fatigue from being in the machine.

After 8:45am Abe6 has an ear bleed.

Aaron7 explains about how he found the fail-safe and went back to record the conversations.

Aaron7 goes to the basketball court to have Will invite Rachel's ex-boyfriend to the party. He takes a shot, and misses it this time (possibly due to side effects of time traveling.) Missing the shot does not affect the outcome of the conversation.

After 3:15pm Abe6 and Aaron7 discuss whether or not they should invite Rachel to the party. They decide to do so to make sure that the ex-boyfriend can be caught in the act, and thus go to jail, making it impossible for him to threaten her life later when she's alone.

Rachel calls Abe6 and he invites her to the party.

Evening Abe6 and Aaron7 go to the party. They remove the bullets from Rachel's ex-boyfriend's shotgun. When he brings the gun in, Aaron7 takes it from him and the ex-boyfriend is arrested.

After Monday:

Daytime At the airport, Abe6 is angry with Aaron7 for messing with time travel too much. Aaron7 comments on how Abe6 wants his wife and kid. Abe6 gets angrier and they part ways.

Abe6 goes to secretly take pieces from the machine so that Abe0 and Aaron0 never discover time travel.

Aaron0 breaks out of the attic and Abe0 breaks out of the closet.

Aaron7 goes to France to build a room-sized time machine.",1362441600,4,19217,4.364199268224036
2220907,5,B0007N1JC8,"Why is it that as soon as a DVD goes temporarily out of print, those with copies to sell raise the price anywhere from 400-1000%? Previously, I bought two copies of this DVD from Amazon for about $10 each. After watching it several times, I gave them to friends as gifts. I logged onto Amazon today to buy another copy (for myself) only to find that the opportunistic profiteers are now asking anywhere from $40 to over $100 for it. As one might suspect, this leads to a lose-lose situation. I lose the ability (or at least the willingness) to buy and enjoy this DVD, and they lose the sale.
  With that said, Primer is a wonderful movie about the discovery of the technology to enable time travel. I have no doubt that if the ability to travel through time is ever discovered, that discovery will take place exactly as portrayed in this film. Written from a fly on the wall standpoint, anyone who has read Hackers by Stan Levy, or is familiar with the early days of Apple Computers (when Steve Jobs was still working out of his garage) will feel dj vu all over again ;) Everything is so believable it's scary. It's the reality that wasn't (or was it?).
  Admittedly, it's the type of movie that best appeals to fans of ""hard science"" fiction. There are no special effects, no wisecracking aliens, no supernatural forces... just a technology beyond our present level of understanding. There is little character development, but this is a film about concepts - not about characters. I didn't find this movie extremely difficult to follow or understand, but be prepared to pay attention. This is not the type of film to watch while eating dinner, or minding the kids.",1361491200,7,1665,4.614864864864865
2220908,3,B0007N1JC8,"I like a challenge, but this is one of the most confusing movies of all time. Despite its brevity, looping plot, and highfalutin physics dialogue, Primer (2004) still comes away a winner in my book.

I am not sure if this movie's circularity actually makes sense. Really. (Chuck Klosterman is said to have seen it seven or eight times and is still not sure what transpired.) The basic premise is that a group of four dudes accidentally invent a time machine in a garage while spending their spare time after their day jobs working on computer hardware. Aaron, the married guy with the garage, and Abe, his single friend, decide to keep the discovery a secret from the two other dudes.

If only they could keep the secret from their past selves (or is it future selves?).  Abe decides to fashion a desk-sized version of their first television-sized time travel box. And this is where the movie gets really interesting, raising all kinds of philosophical and existential issues along the way about time and space, morality, and reality.

I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that Abe and Aaron start to travel through time. Like any red-blooded American males that have moved beyond college and into the working world, the guys predictably use time travel schemes to boost their financial situations. They exploit the stock market. But, things become less than kosher and fancy free when trust breaks down between Abe and Aaron.

The final 15 minutes of this movie are a head-scratcher. There is so much looping and nefarious backstabbing going on between Abe, Aaron, and their ""time doubles"" that I could not follow it. Wikipedia has a nice diagram that explains the time travel device and how it works; I can't understand that, either. I walked away feeling that the creator of this movie is very intelligent, but not in a way that allows him to leave the average viewer (i.e., me) walking away feeling victorious for figuring out the M.C. Escher maze that was laid out. Good luck.

I am a fan of short movies, and at 78 minutes Primer is a miracle of efficiency. But, the pithiness of the film was a product of necessity and a small bankroll, so it is possible that my gripes about the last 15 minutes might have been lessened if the director/actor/writer/producer/cameraman in charge of this picture had more film stock to work with. Just another 10 minutes might have relaxed the breakneck pace and confusing looping in the last 15 minutes.

One of the most incredible aspects of this film is that it was produced on a $7,000 budget, most of it dedicated to film stock. In the first five to 10 minutes of action, you'll note that the cinematography and sound are not up to big studio snuff. The dialogue seems to overlap, and the acting is wooden. After the time machine is discovered and the plot really kicks into gear, the brilliant story takes over and you forget about the amateur, low-budget feel. You relate to the protagonists, placing yourself into their shoes and considering the implications of the ""fun"" that time travel could provide before the complications rear their ugly heads. The middle of this movie is the satisfying thought-provoker, the beginning the underwhelming physics lesson, and the ending a mystifying quagmire.

Primer works if you go in with a little knowledge of the plot, have already slogged through movies like Memento and Inception, and bring your patience ""A"" game. And don't do this one alone. The real fun with a movie like Primer is discussing it with your friends and family afterwards.",1361318400,4,3549,4.787581699346405

The head scratching is not due to any plot holes or lack of tight writing, however; it's merely the result of the mind blowing thought experiment that Carruth brings to life in the film.

They are doing this in one of the guy's garages.  Literally.  Two of the more invested guys actually get the thing to work but not like they envisioned.

The machine has the capability to move ahead in time.  Rather than enhance or announce their discovery, they decide to use it for financial gain in the stock market.  There is also a sequence to alter events effecting people they are involved with.  The dialog is filled with scientific mumbo jumbo that I'm sure few will understand.  This wasn't the first time travel movie obviously and certainly not the last either; but I don't know of another that did it for a few thousand bucks with the same effect.

Shane Carruth is the mastermind behind this production which appears to be shot on a handicam and edited on a home computer.  Don't get me wrong, the editing and composition are first rate.  Carruth does it all, including direction, photography, editing, screenwriting, scoring and acting.  I suspect he was in charge of the food truck as well.

Of course, the guys who made it are all engineers, so they were able to cluge together the things they needed for it. In fact, it comes off rather like a true story they way they did it.

A group of four engineers are working on something in the garage of one of their homes, and I must say it is not obvious what they were planning to create. What they got started out being some sort of super-efficient energy source, so that may be what was intended. But what they ended up with was a time machine. Not like the H.G. Wells type that takes you forward or backward to a specified time. It's more like the time turner that Hermione Granger used in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Of course, there are paradoxes to avoid, but that's no problem. They just look up what stock has increased in value the most, then go into the time reversal machine (stored in a storage bin they rented), and when they come out, go buy a bunch of that stock.

The real problem comes when they get word that a former boyfriend of one of their friends came into a party and started shooting. Of course they want to go back and change things so nobody gets hurt.

If you can follow the permutations of the action, and realize which ""edition"" of the two men who are moving through time you see at a given time, you're more clever than I am. I think I'd have to see it several more times to get it all straight.

It's a mind-blower, an amazingly clever plot, and my hats are off to these guys for a very good movie on what was allegedly about $7,000 budget.

WHY do they go through the whole movie wearing shirts and ties with slacks? They wear them when they're lounging at home or working on the machine, everywhere. They look like Mormon missionaries.

When the swindlers report that the suit is finished, they mime dressing him and the Emperor then marches in procession before his subjects, who play along with the pretense. Suddenly, a child in the crowd, too young to understand the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all......"".

""Primer"" might be the greatest inside joke on audiences since the 1938 radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"".  It was meant to be confusing and subject to multiple interpretations.  There is a relatively restricted voice over narration which breaks with film convention by being unreliable, adding yet another layer of vagueness to the story.  ""Primer""  requires engaged viewers to give free reign to their imaginations, and since the commercial films these viewers have been consuming are too structured for multiple interpretation, the novelty causes some of them to proclaim it a work of considerable genius.

Indeed its subject matter, the perils and paradoxes of time travel set in motion by an inexplicable amoral character (Aaron - versions one, two, and three) with futile fixes by an equally inexplicable moral character (Abe - versions one and two), present quite a cerebral challenge to a viewer seeking such a challenge.  Unfortunately all this is at the expense of concurrent suspense or on-screen entertainment value; there is plenty of fun to be had with this film, but the enjoyment comes retrospectively after the initial viewing.

In ""Primer"" time travel is only possible to the past where the traveler must mark time in real hours before a return to the present, the time machine cannot be used to leap forward into the future.  And one can only travel back to the point at which the time machine first existed (there must be a time machine in the past from which a person can emerge).  It presents time travel as a process where causality does not affect the time traveler.  Making it the flip side of ""Back to the Future"",  whose premise was the peril to Marty McFly's existence should he alter the events that led to his being born.  ""Primer's"" time travelers can alter past events and thereby change the future, but the corporeal form that time traveled to the past is immune from the consequences of their actions;  thus any number of the same person can exist simultaneously.

The film itself is a poorly told narrative whose assorted deficiencies (be they deliberate, necessary economies, or just general laziness) are disguised behind a smokescreen of non-unified, noncontiguous representations of space and time (literally and figuratively); with segments and timelines full of jump cuts and inserts that fracture the sequencing.  If you listen to the commentaries on the DVD you will find that pre-production was an afterthought and that those associated with the film were generally clueless during its ultra-cheap production phase.

Everything happened in post-production, where the motivation was not to assemble the best told version of the story with the material they had shot; but rather a desperate and inventive effort to create enough confusion and ambiguity that the staggering lameness of the actual production would be adequately obscured.  Watch for several occasions where a single segment is cut and the visual pieces re-assembled in a different order, while the audio track plays in its original order.

Thus you have a modern day ""Emperor's New Clothes"", a film that exploits the conceit of its most enthusiastic viewer segment.  Rather than appear to be rubes these viewers attribute the confusion to the genius of writer/director/star Shane Carruth.  Even taking it so far as to disparage those who do not enthusiastically embrace the film (note the negative votes for earlier reviews that do not 100% embrace the film - people hate to have it pointed out that they have been duped by a crowd mentality). To be fair, judging from the DVD commentaries no one associated with the film appears to have taken the thing very seriously, or to be terribly taken with themselves, or to be affecting (at least at the time they were taped) any Orsen Welles pretensions.

Patrick McGoohan had a similar experience with ""The Prisoner"", a television series that explored deeper subject matter than your standard secret agent show.  A cult developed around the series, attributing intentional symbolism, metaphor, allegory, and philosophical substance to every word, gesture, and production design element.  Although unlike ""Primer"", ""The Prisoner"" was a top quality production that had some profound things to say,  just not to the degree its cult following wants to believe.

I continue to enjoy repeat viewings of ""Primer"" and continued speculations about the ramifications of what it presents.  But for the actual exercise of reading a film with a scrambled timeline, I prefer something like ""The Life Before Her Eyes"" (2007);  where the timelines are also fractured and a fair about of expressionistic elements are inserted, but  all done by design in the service of inventively telling the story and better communicating the themes.

2220941,5,B0007N1JC8,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I am frustrated that it got relatively little attention.

There are several comments here about the budget, the dialogue, the confusing juxtaposition of the story-telling, etc.  I agree with many of the comments:  the dialogue & acting are quite good, but not stellar.  The dialogue is often so rampant that it's hard to follow much; this is true, but it is actually quite effective in showing how folks act when they think of & create something so cool that they cannot contain themselves.  Etc.

But the storyline and the manner in which it is told is so incredible, tight, and complex that it is mind-boggling.  For this alone, the movie deserves 5 stars, however, to reiterate above, the acting, etc. was better than decent.  It is true that you likely will not fully understand the movie after watching it just once.  If that irritates you, don't watch this.  However, if you enjoy having to think through a movie BECAUSE THAT IS PART OF THE MOVIE, there is nothing better.  I have read this movie is like Pi... perhaps, but it is so much better.  I can see the storytelling as resembling ""Momento"" (also one of my favorites), but again, it is so much better here in Primer.  I can also see it sharing a similar ""time-paradox"" aspect with 12 Monkeys, but here Primer also outshines it.

This movie uses ingenious storytelling and complex concepts to play upon a powerful theme:  would omnipotence make a person more kind, or more evil.  This movie plays with power & God complexes beyond those of being a spy, the president, or even a superhero.  Yet, somehow both the movie & the characters seem so much more simple, palpable, and touchable.  In my opinion, that just helps to bring more urgency to this matter of omnipotence, and how it corrupts.

To the budge point:  I am just so glad that absolutely awesome movies can still be made with a moderate budget.  This movie is proof that some of the best ideas will come from unexpected directions... and it's nice to know a movie can be made without knowing for certain whether it will make lots of money or not.",1312848000,6,2113,4.623655913978495
2220942,5,B0007N1JC8,"I seldom review movies, but felt compelled to review this one. This movie is a special gem.

I also seldom buy movies, but I bought this for myself and all my engineer/math/computer scientist friends. This movie is so subtle yet so insidious. And yes, I had to watch it at least 3 times before I began to fully realize how complex it was. Watching it is a recursive experience in itself. Each time something new is illuminated. I will not give away the content, but if you think there are only a couple timelines in here and only two people... you are missing most of the movie. There are many more levels, permutations, and acting parties, all embedded, so in effect you are watching the culmination of potentially an infinite number altered originals. In fact, the entire movie plot may just be one permutation among many alternates. The last minute of the movie made me rethink the entire premise once again and forced me to re-watch it again.... and just as before I walked away realizing that there was more to the story than before. (A sick part of me thinks this would be a great movie to give as a weird form of am IQ exam. To see which people can identify how many number of timelines in it after watching the movie only once... I would probably not fare too well)

The fact that the movie lacks almost all exposition (except for the brief phone message voice over) makes this a story you must watch with a clear head and an attention to detail. The details in the movie are everything. I would like to say that this rivals David Lynch, except that David Lynch has never made a coherent movie that was in fact logically flawless. There are no mistakes here, blatant contradictions, deus ex machina resolutions, or weird ambiguities for the sake of weirdness. This movie feels like it was written by either a mathematician or a logician. It is simply put, flawless in design and conception. A part of me is extremely jealous. I could go on about the low budget, the dedication of everyone involved in the production, but that would miss the entire point of this movie.

Regardless of the production or anything related to it, the movie, on its own stands for as a the benchmark against which all other time-travel, multiverse, etc. movies will have to be judged against. It is one of my top 3 movies of all time. Inception was fun, but only had 3 or so plausible alternative explanations. This here has... well enough to make Godel chuckle. I defy anyone to tell me of another time travel movie that is more consistent in its recursive M.C. Escher-esque beauty.

For those who gave this movie 1 star, you probably didn't quite get something. I recommend you do any of the following (1) watch it again and realize you are watching a movie about recursive time travel, (2) read up about the concept of recursion, and (3) if you're still lost look up the detailed chart available online that shows all the timelines and how they are intertwined.",1309910400,7,2950,4.570888468809073

This one was the most confusing and boring out of the three. I persevered and watched the entire thing even though I was tempted to turn it off. I thought the telephone booth in Bill and Ted's was a dumb vehicle for time travel but the boxes in this were a little less imaginative than that even. On the whole I think time travel movies are hard to follow with people coming in and out of the past future and seeing duplicates of themselves. This movie added a whole other level to that kind of confusion. It was recommended I watch it again but I think I may just move on.,1307059200,,720,4.262773722627737

It is like drinking a cup of black coffee that was brewed by a robot built by a computer. It's a bit of an aquired taste and probably more palatable for non-humans. The acting? Well, it didn't seem to be in the budget. Nevertheless, Michaelmatician proclaims that the film is relevant as well as aestetically and historically valid.

2220948,5,B0007N1JC8,"Others have explained here the basic plot of PRIMER: how two young engineers, while working on another project, accidentally create a time machine.  Their seemingly innocuous trips through time create dark consequences and rifts in their relationship, things neither of them had ever expected to happen.  The film is not at all linear to a ""normal"" person's perspective, and most people will have to watch the movie a few times (or search for an explanation online) before they will even begin to figure out what really happened.  It is a low-budget thriller with excellent scriptwriting and actors that portray very realistic reactions to the emotional chaos that they realize they are creating all around them.  I enjoyed the film very much--especially once I understood it.

I was one of those people who had to look online to see what had really happened.  I saw the movie, an anniversary present from last year that had been forgotten and unwatched for too long, this past week by myself while my husband was at work.  I found it suspenseful and intriguing, and knew immediately when I was 'missing' something, but of course I was too confused to even begin to understand what I had misunderstood.  When my husband came home that night, and I told him I finally watched it, he essentially whined, ""Will I love it or will I hate it?""  Not for this review to be about us, but my husband is one of the most logical and emotionally detached yet irritable individuals I've ever met (think a cynical Mr. Spock from STAR TREK).  So I essentially just arranged for last night, Friday, to be a date night where we watched it together...

Little surprise, my husband understood IT ALL in one go, but I was more curious if he liked it or not (he did).  We sat on the couch afterward and I fired question after question at him, and he explained everything to me, I really was kind of proud of him!  But it amazed me how differently people's minds work, and it made me realize how so many people just couldn't understand PRIMER in one viewing because their thought processes are too linear, the cut-up fashion of the movie's action leaves so much more unsaid than ever shown.  Either way, it is a thinking person's movie, and I wouldn't expect everyone to like it or have the patience to watch it x times over to understand it.  Yet even though I was personally one of those people who needed help to understand it, I found it to be a great sci-fi thriller even with my initial confusion.",1297468800,3,2480,4.617312072892939

That story illustrates the consequences of trying to go back in time and ""fix"" things.  Kinda like a snake eating it's own tail.

I guess the idea's been done already before Primer, but it's still a very imaginative movie to watch.  Saw it once and will definitely give it another spin.  Looks great for the budget.  It doesn't hit you over the head with time-travel, but instead shows you the consequences of trying to ""fix the past"".

Several reviews said that there was too much ""geeky mumbo jumbo."" While that may be true, the real smarts of this movie are not in the jargon or science in which the  characters are involved, but in the presentation of a deeply complex storyline that is intended to be confusing in order to create in the audience the same unknowing that the characters have. None of the elements of the movie felt stale or tired, and the sum felt very different from what you see from Hollywood, which I mean as a compliment.

2220956,3,B0007N1JC8,"YES YES YES. I understand they did this movie for only $7,000, but that doesn't mean it automatically rates 5 stars. For that money they could have enticed kids from the high school drama club to come do some acting for them.

There is an inventor's group of 4 guys who get together and bounce ideas off of each other. They are discussing Tesla coils and coming up with a new economic way to reduce temperatures. Two of the four create a small device in their garage. They place an object in the device and slightly weird things happen such as the object weighs less, and the machine can run by itself for short periods of time without power. The object suddenly has a fungus growth on it. They take it to a lab and find out that it is 30 days worth of growth. How could that be? They then place their watch in the device and discover they have a time machine. Yes, they accidentally created a time machine in their garage which violates all the laws of physics the movie was so careful not to cross.

They make a larger time machine, big enough for a person. They are at first careful not to come in contact with anything or anyone which might alter the future, most likely an idea the got from watching too many science fiction movies. As time goes by, they get bolder on their interactions and they also use the stock market to their advantage. Due to the low budget aspect of the movie, you never see them spend that wealth, or for that matter change their shirt and tie.

If you thought the acting was bad and stiff in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", wait until you take a gander at this movie. This movie appears to have been written by Omni magazine fans, who also decided to star and direct their own movie, having never done one before. The geek aspect of the movie is good, but the movie suffered from lack of drama, comedy, and ability to read a simple line. It was painful to watch as this ThinkFilm became a StinkFilm.

Shane Carruth, the director and one of the main actors, gets a lot right, particularly the atmospherics and dialogue. Unfortunately, the film almost seems too focused on these aspects, but leaves viewers confused about the plot. It's an odd film, but one definitely worth checking out if you like thoughtful, cerebral sci-fi.

Oddly enough, for a sci-fi movie about time travel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primer/dp/B0007N1JC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primer</a>'s treatment of science is easily one of the film's strengths. This is no H.G. Wells'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Time-Machine/dp/0790747324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Time Machine</a>, where time travel simply involves a machine with lots of lights and gadgets. Rather, the time machine in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primer/dp/B0007N1JC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primer</a>&nbsp;is a much more sophisticated affair. At least the first 20-30 minutes show Carruth and David Sullivan's characters discussing the science behind the machine and sharing the audience's surprise at the discovery of time travel. This stems from Carruth's astute understanding that many key scientific breakthroughs happen through serendipity, not dramatic eureka moments. Sure, much of it is techno-babble, but it's probably the most convincing depiction of a time machine and time travel ever in cinematic history.

Unfortunately, the techno-babble at the beginning can be intimidating for many viewers. I understand why Carruth spent so much time on this aspect. It's important to convince the audience to suspend its disbelief regarding time travel (always a tall order). It also sets the mood as the plot moves from science (the wonder of discovery) to ethics (the dilemma of using it). It's a nice transition, but that is perhaps overdone a bit at the beginning.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primer/dp/B0007N1JC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primer</a>&nbsp;also makes good use of its very limited budget. The camera angles were consistently interesting and innovative; sometimes up close, sometimes through a window. The video quality is grainy, but rather than looking like a bad transfer to DVD, it gives the film a ""home"" or real-life quality that Hollywood can't capture.

The biggest problem I had with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primer/dp/B0007N1JC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primer</a>&nbsp;is the plot. It's rather convoluted and I don't feel like the film did enough at the beginning to really make the ending resonate with audiences. I'd say during the first hour the plot is discernible, if not exactly easy to comprehend. However, it's during the crucial last 20 minutes when it's not entirely clear who is doing what, when, how, and why. I watched those last 20 minutes twice and got the gist of it, but couldn't help thinking that there were too many loose threads. There is one plot twists that seems quite important and mysterious, but is never explained.

Both characters go off in directions that don't seem to follow from what we know of them - or perhaps the movie doesn't tell us enough about them to understand their character arc. I think a bit more time developing the two main characters and their relationships beyond their time machine work would have helped. It's a shame because perhaps 10 more minutes of plot exposition (at 80 minutes, the film is actually pretty short) would have made this one of the top movies of the past decade",1282867200,,3856,6.32319391634981
2220959,4,B0007N1JC8,"I was as confused as anyone else starting with ""Act II"" of this film.  I have this film figured out and have solved the mystery, me thinks.  No, it had nothing to do with the assorted websites and diagrams devoted to the paradoxes of time travel and ""Weeble"" creation (duplicates) pertaining to this film's uncharacteristically intelligent take on time travel.  I figured it out when I learned of Primer's humble microbudget of a $7000.  With this budget, nearly every penney had to have gone to Super 16 film stock and lab fees.  I thought this film was shot on video (which is fine) - looked it, and assumed so given its budget, but was perplexed by selective focus and scenes containing ""bokeh"" (generally film-only).  Often, long-term ""labor of love"" indies are shot sequentially or near sequentially, unlike big budget pics, which ironically are shot way out of sequence around location availability, sets, and actor schedules.  So, here's my theory - it's simple.  The film was shot sequentially, with the quite credible and well-handled ""accidental invention of the time machine"" sequences happening first as it was in the script. There was only so much film stock available - and once that was gone, that was it.  Too much precious film stock was used up early on - perhaps the actors couldn't do the 1:1(?) OR 2:1 tight shooting ratio, leaving not enough film left to explore the paradoxes in the 2nd half of the script.  This resulted in (in my opinion) an unbalanced film that spends too much time on the creation of the time machine, and not nearly enough exposition time in the second half to explain the paradoxes and duplicates - or even get into the deterioration of the relationship between Aaron and Abe.  The first half sucks you in, and the second half plays out like you have your DVD running at 4X speed - with just ""snippets"" of scenes wizzing by giving you a sketch of what's happening but no where near enough data to process to approach anything other than partial coherence at best (and most likely utter cluelessness...)  Now, what I've proposed is admittedly pure speculation but that's my guess.  Somehow, through clever editing or a ""happy accident"" - whatever, it all manages to work, and the net-net is a pretty compelling and certainly unique little indy time travel flick.  - Excellent natural performances, excellent time-travel concept, very good natural dialog, compositions are often outstanding (though not the best Super 16 transfer I've ever seen), acceptable audio and minimal but unobtrusive and appropriate score all add. Primer does somehow manage ultimately to work as a riddle - so in my speculation/opinion, hours were spent editing to salvage it from an incomperhensal, unreleasable, and unwatachable mess.  And while perhaps not hitting a ""home run"" in the process, hit a safe by a nose triple.  I watched it twice, and went to the 'Net to get ""cheats"".  Any film that manages to get me to do this earns a solid four stars in my book.  Primer is a flawed but compelling sci-fi film - a little overrated perhaps, but certainly worth your time.  It's a good time at the movies via an unusual route (incomprehension!) not travelled since the ""starchild"" ending of Kubrick's 2001.",1279497600,,3227,4.86654478976234

I don't want to talk about the synopsis of ""Primer"" in this review, because that really would spoil things.
When I first watched this movie all I knew was that it explored time travel.

Every now and then a movie comes along that is best watched with absolutely no knowledge of what it is about - that way you can more easily be sucked into the movie, like being a fly on the wall - experiencing all the thoughts and feelings of the characters in real time, and having to think quickly in real time - which is something that will push your mind to the limit in ""Primer"".

After my first viewing I could literally feel the neurons on my brain re-arranging themselves and forming new connections. I couldn't stop thinking about the movie. I had to watch it again - IMMEDIATELY!

""Primer"" is a work of genious in my opinion. It is amazing that one man could have literally created all components of this film all by himself, with the help of family and friends.

The permutations of ""Primer"" are seemingly endless.

2220961,5,B0007N1JC8,"A time travel story confronts the paradox: how can a traveler to the past avoid affecting the future in uncontrollable ways? ""Primer"" tackles the conundrum with compelling force, cerebral gymnastics and the python grip of inexorable logic.
  The joke goes: What do they do with engineers who turn 40? They take them out and shoot them.
  A quartet of engineers who work for a Dallas semiconductor company have decided to pool their talents in their spare time to develop an original invention, a break-through process or a patentable idea that will have commercial applications and deliver them from the dreary tedium of their work-driven lives before the promise of their most productive years slips away and consigns them to permanent disappointment.
  They are not geniuses. ""Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated. Nothing extreme."" On their best days, they might be considered ""clever.""
  In their off duty hours they work in long-sleeved shirts and ties. They conduct experiments on the cheap in a garage with borrowed equipment. They buy electronic components from Walmart. They cannibalize a microwave oven, a car, a refrigerator. Brimming with notions, they speak in elliptical sentences and argue briskly in the language of physics and electrical engineering.
  ""They took from their surroundings what was needed and made of it something more.""
  Abe and Aaron are the first to see sparks fly from their flints. After months of fruitless tries, they produce a field in an enclosed box that creates more energy than it uses. ""There was value in the thing."" They knew that. What might be its practical application? ""They were out of their depth."" They realize that ""the easiest way to get exploited was to sell something they did not yet understand."" They decide to cut out their partners.
  More weeks of hit and miss experiments reveal a stunning fact: their box drew its energy from a continuous feedback loop that could return its contents to the past. They had built a time machine.
  The next step is inevitable: they must test their device on themselves. They build a pair of coffin-sized boxes to generate their field. Aaron asks, ""What is your opinion on how safe this thing is?""
  Abe shrugs, ""I can imagine no way in which this thing could be considered remotely close to safe.""
  The device has its limits. It does not propel its occupants into the future. It can only return them to the moment at which it was activated. Abe and Aaron warm up the boxes for five days, enter them, and return to the past.
  The practical application is obvious. The device grants them five days of prescience, enough certain knowledge of outcomes to reap fortunes from jackpot lottery numbers, sports wagers, and spectacularly performing market securities.
  There are also complications. The past is exactly as they have left it and it includes them as they were before they traveled backward in time. They have become their own doubles.
  They are alert to the peril of discovery by their doubles or by anybody who might detect them in two places at once, wives, relatives, friends, or their partners unaware of their invention. ""If we're playing with causality..."" Abe worries. They take themselves ""out of the equation"" by sequester in an out-of-town motel, disconnecting phones, television, radio - anything that might keep them connected electronically or emotionally to their personal world.
  Leaving their doubles to continue replaying the crucial five days, Abe and Aaron repeat their trips back to the original moment of their machine's activation, returning each time with an accumulation of knowledge they can transform into exponential growth of bankable cash.
  Their circuitous repetitions of time travel take a physical toll. Their ears bleed. Their hands lose the ability to fashion script. Their decision-making faculties lose focus. Aaron voices a fantasy of violent confrontation with an obnoxious superior, ""just to know what it feels like"", then explains that he would subsequently prevent himself from the act by intervening before it occurred. Abe reminds him that contact with their doubles must never happen. The consequences would be inconceivable. But ""The idea had been spoken. The words wouldn't go back after they had been uttered aloud.""
  ""I'm not going to pretend I know about paradoxes."" Aaron admits. ""About the worst thing in the world is to know that the moment you're experiencing has already been plotted.""
  In a moment of shocking clarity, as Aaron and Abe observe their doubles from afar, they realize that they have no way of knowing whether either of them, without the knowledge of the other, has already altered their past. Mistrust has introduced a variable into their equation. The permutations are terrifying.
  ""What's worse,"" Aaron wonders, ""thinking you're being paranoid or knowing that you should be?""
  Writer/director Shane Carruth, who also edited and stars in the film and composed its music and sound effects, is a one-man band, who produced ""Primer"" on an onion-skin budget, stocked the cast and crew with friends and family, and delivered a taut, intricate, visually arresting, intellectually stimulating gem. Crafting film virtue from raw necessity and quicksilver imagination, Carruth employs low-key realism in cost-conscious characters, tech-heavy dialog, taped-together props, and naturalistic lighting. With quickening pace, the narrative contours move from the familiar to the fantastic. It is a convincing fable of garage science yielding profound innovation with infinite implications.
  ""They took from their surroundings what was needed and made of it something more."" ""Primer"" is an alchemical miracle: base materials transmuted into cinematic gold.",1271289600,6,5725,5.241492864983535
2220962,5,B0007N1JC8,"I first saw this in 2004 or 2005, right after it won an award in Sundance.  The Blockbuster I frequented had this small section filled with Sundance, IFC, and indie films.  My girlfriend and I used to immediately go to that section every time we visited (and we rented a ton of movies back then).

Anyway... we watched it at home, and she sort of grew bored with it.  However I was enthralled.  From the very beginning this drew me in.  I loved the matter of fact style it had, when dealing with garage inventors/engineers.  I had no clue what it was about, because it was just so new back then.  I didn't even know it was a science fiction film.  If I remember, the box sort of sounded like a thriller.  I think I must have watched it three times during that first rental.

Since watching it that first time, I've probably watched this film 20 times.  I remember the first time I had the inclination to watch it again.  It must have been year or so after we first rented it.  I was looking for it online, but my girlfriend and I couldn't remember the name.  I searched and searched, but came up dry.  I went back to that same Blockbuster but they had since purged all their old VHS movies and replaced them with DVDs.  Unfortunately they didn't replace all of their films, so Primer was nowhere to be found.

I've purchased Primer for countless numbers of friends and family.  I actually just gave a copy to my brother for his birthday a few days ago (along with a slew of other strange films).  I would gift it to friends and family on iTunes as well, if the distributor had the sense to put it there.  I swear, if I had money, I'd invest in Shane Carruth's next film.  This guy is brilliant.  If anyone has seen this film, but hasn't read the story behind it --- do yourself a favor and research it.  primermovie.com is a good place to start.  I feel lucky that I stumbled into it, without knowing anything about it.  I'm the kind of person that doesn't want to be spoiled by revealing trailers or in-depth reviews before I watch a film.  Learning about Carruth's story after the fact made it much more interesting.

Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.  Shane Carruth deserves our support and respect for his wonderful creation.  Share it with a friend.  Give it as a gift.... and re-watch it over and over.  I swear it's fun!",1255392000,2,2333,4.3534883720930235
2220963,4,B0007N1JC8,"If you're into huge explosions, sex symbols, car chases, bullet-infested shootouts, and a very fast pace, then Primer is certainly NOT for you. However, if you're into slow-paced, complex, and philosophical films, then chances are you'll love this movie. I myself was a bit bothered by the slow and simplistic approach to a thriller about time travel, but as time past, I found it an enjoyable experience (but not too enjoyable). The only flaws I found was that the film's concept of time travel is so complicated that I doubt I'll ever understand it completely after repeated viewings. And plus, the film does tend to drag in certain places. But that aside, I think the extremely slow pace of the film really works. Unlike most fast-paced films, this film still manages to help us see what's going on (if you don't mind the numerous scientific explanations). And the very little use of music is very effective; I think it shows that time travel may not be as grand and powerful as it seems. In short, Shane Carruth has created a unique sci-fi film. The lack of bombast, quickness, and huge explosions is what makes this very special; it's a film that truly makes us think.

2220965,4,B0007N1JC8,"A small group of engineers spent their nights and weekends making this exciting and low key science fiction thriller about a small group of engineers who spend their nights and weekends trying to create something marketable, and create something far more exciting and dangerous than they could have anticipated.  With it, they open Pandora's box and a metaphysical can of worms.

What I like the most about the film is what will likely turn some viewers off: its elliptical and condensed style and dialogue.  It is that these engineers speak like engineers.  They talk to each other as if they each actually know something, and they'd be impatient and annoyed if they were expected to repeat or explain themselves.  You could say they out-mamet David Mamet, by acting like what they are supposed to be, highly intelligent inventors (rather than like Hollywood movie stars pretending to be academics).  You are either in it and know what's going on, or you don't and if you don't don't bother asking.  So when one of them slows down and starts explaining, leading his partner through the process of figuring out just what it is their device does, you really have to pay attention.

This is the kind of film that the Sundance film festival - where I saw this first and where Primer won the Grand Jury Prize - was made to celebrate.  It is inventive and unsettling, thoughtful and provocative, and makes maximum use of a very low budget.  I can't believe they made this for seven grand and favors!  The sound design suffers a bit, but they create a very intriguing minimalist aesthetic with a unique and edgy look.  A very impressive film and one of the best science fiction films I've seen in the last decade.  Not for everyone, since you have to watch very closely and pay attention -- a very different concept for those who have grown accustomed to associating science fiction with CGI effects, fast paced action, and explosives.",1249430400,6,1929,4.774096385542169

I thought this movie would get a lot more exciting. There was a build up to nothing. All of the exciting stuff was briefly put into a final montage, with some annoying voice speaking over mostly unexplained images. I just didn't get it, nor do I really care to take the time to figure it out.

  In my youth and through most of my adult life I have enjoyed what is referred to as hard science fiction.  There is a wealth of literature in this genre but very few films that have been made using this formula.  Primer is one attempt, and I praise the filmmaker for it, but as a film is just does not stand up to the requirements of what a good film is in my opinion.  You can analyze the plot construction and the paradoxes the film raises but that is just an exercise that any conversation with someone with the same interests accomplishes.  Most of this film seems to be exactly that.  A film needs to be much more than intellectual discourse, no matter how intriguing the idea.
  As many have pointed out the film is very hard to follow.  Even though it has a stylized look, (mainly due to its low budget), that look is very drab and boring.  I love films that are visually stunning and use symbolism and metaphors to tell their story.  Even if I didn't get it the first time I am compelled to watch the film again and again, each time gaining new insight into its secrets.  The process is exciting and interesting because of the look and style of the film and the emotions it provokes.  I guess I could watch this film over and over and start to unravel its story but I just have no desire to. I can watch a Bergman or Lynch film over and over and even if I come to no concrete conclusion I at least enjoy the experience.
  Here is a list of hard sci fi films that I feel have been successful. I'd be interested if others might add to the list.  Forbidden Planet, The Andromeda Strain, Silent Running, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Terminator, Alien, Alens.  I'm still waiting for film adaptations of many of Arthur C. Clarks stories, especially Childhood's End.",1246147200,9,1990,4.385245901639344

Probably the most fascinating debut film of the decade. It's amazing that a movie on a shoestring budget could work so well, particularly when you consider that it's a sci-fi flick. The depiction of believable characters working on a superconductor project in a garage is particularly well executed because it stays away from Jacob's Ladders and pulsing warp cores, instead focusing on seemingly mundane minutiae that begins to reveal interesting potential and then veers off into an ethical fencing match that carries the story into a complex third act that you may have to see graphed out to even begin to understand.

2220973,5,B0007N1JC8,"Challenging and hard to follow and that's a good thing. I love it when a film assumes its audience has some intelligence and imagination! This is the best time-travel Sci-Fi film I have ever seen. It addresses the complex physical and philosophic implications, and the writing is extremely tight. One picks up on new things with each viewing. On my short list of films worth owning.
PACE The movie is NOT slow, but IS dialogue-based. Some confuse action with pace. The dialogue is dense and moves quickly.
SUBTLETY Nothing in this film is spelled out in big neon letters and shoved down your throat. The acting is far from over the top: no big gestures, or gut wrenching scenes of emotional agony. Important moments pass by without close-ups, pauses, musical queues or other typical ""important moment markers"" found in most films. One must pay attention.
HOLES Some events are not explicitly shown or explained. These holes must be filled in by one's imagination. This requires complex puzzle solving type of thinking which can be painful for two reasons. First, this is almost never required by your typical movie. Second, not everybody thinks like this or enjoys puzzles. I love it when movies call for imagination.
PLOT The plot is NOT incomprehensible. Even the complexities of the time lines have been meticulously analyzed and are available on-line (do a search for ""Primer timeline""). It IS complex and challenging. Guess some don't like that.
ACTING I found their portrayal of young entrepreneurial engineering science geeks rather convincing. Also see SUBTLETY. No David Carusoian over acting here!
SCIENCE They make no effort to present the scientific aspects in layman's terms. But it doesn't matter. While some people may want to understand the physics, math and mechanics behind their invention, it is not relevant to the other aspects of the plot.

That ignorance didn't detract from The Big Sleep being one of the film noir classics. But the writer, director, Jack-of-all-trades, master of none who put out Primer obviously doesn't have any better of idea of what was happening in his movie than most of his audience did.

The infamously inexpensive production cost (US$6,000) in no way diminishes the suspenseful rendering of suburban mediocrity in which the two lead characters work together and later disown each others' company over the increasing complications and disturbing consequences of their discovery.

It's a glance at the what/how/whys of the discovery of time travel.  All the elements are there.  And it is truly intended to give you no answers (after all... it's not called ""Conclusions"").

My first viewing of Primer was on IFC, and I started watching it 15 minutes into it.  I ended that viewing angry above all else.  I decided there must have been something I missed in that first 15 minutes that ties it all together.

So I watched it again, in its entirety.  And then I began to understand.

Primer goes through the process of discovery... what can be considered a REAL scientific discovery.  Which is actually not convenient to a movie format.  But they do it, and leave it raw, with the crosstalk, tedious explanations, and egotistical posturing that goes along with any engineer who thinks they're right (believe me... it happens).

Then after discovery, it delves into the human condition.  Wanting to exploit it for profit, then considering the moral implications, then devolving into the selfishness of trying to play god.

And the way it is filmed, as things progress, there are intentional gaps as timelines become more blurred and disconnected.  This makes Primer incredibly original, and great fun to play with the possibilities.

It truly stimulates the mind, and gives you something to walk away with and think about for days after viewing.  THIS is a measure of a great film.  And when you think about the spirit of the film, its budget constraints, it makes Primer a must see.

Sometimes the dialogues seemed unecessarily deep (when discussing super conductors)  and sometimes too shallow ( when discussing the output of a 12 volt car battery - yeah we know its 12 volts).

2220985,5,B0007N1JC8,"Building components in your garage and not knowing what they do - it seems like a bad idea until you create something amazing. And amazing was what was created in the fallout seen in Primer. The explanation is easy enough to give: you have something go into Side A of something and come out Side B when you look at the rules we regularly follow. What if the rules did not apply, however, and what if the thing entering Side A also leaves Side A, pushing aside the constructs of time and crafting a reversal of sorts. It seems endless, like a beautiful thing filled with money and power and promise of the grandest type, until you really think of what could come from creating a truly remarkable breakthrough.
You never know who your friends are until you find something to test those waters. Sometimes the adage about you being your own worst enemy - that might possibly be true.

I'm not one for the costs of movies, not really impressed with the label ""independent"" slapped on a shaky project, because movies are movies in the end and many aren't given financial backin. Many genre-specific classics were made on shoestring budgets, and entries like cost sort of fall by the wayside when you look at the end product. While I would not call Primer a classic piece of work, I would call it a great movie and would add that I would have never guessed that it was premiered Independently. The camerawork is great, the acting is really good, and the jargon - despite the use of heavy terminology and dose after dose of wording in speeches that explain things - makes things make sense.
And make sense they do.
When I first watched Primer I found the movie intriguing as a whole because of the way it played through, and because it gave the viewer an idea and started running with it. It took the idea of time and explained how everything worked, allowing a person to pick up with a couple of friends and continue through a corridor of oddity until...well, until a climax is beautifully rendered. It really got my attention.

The reviews on the movie were mixed from the beginning, and the major complaint people had was the heavy use of dialog to substitute action. While I would disagree with that assessment I have to say that was a lot of wordplay here, and if that is a problem then you probably should avoid the movie. If you leave any preconceptions at the door, accepting what the movie tells you, you'll find yourself into a story that makes you want to pause and look over your shoulder because the you yesterday - he might just be a little more ambitious than even you realized.",1193961600,,2585,4.521367521367521
2220986,5,B0007N1JC8,"Perhaps my initial affinity for Primer arose because it's such an underdog.  With a budget of only $7000, the movie itself is virtually a garage invention (a garage invention about a garage invention).  Shane Carruth's direction and editing are as tight and spare as the movie's budget, to good effect. The plot flows smoothly --- when it's hard to follow, this reflects the course of events, which becomes increasingly nonlinear, and very weird.  Most people benefit from a second viewing, myself included.

The main characters, Aaron and Abe, are economically drawn, with just enough emphasis to distinguish their respective personalities and values.  They are what an ""everyman"" would be if everyone had some training in engineering.  The same can be said for the minor characters --- a few deft ""brush strokes"" tell us what we need to know about them, with a dash of humor as leavening.

The lack of big-budget special effects, or even standard digital tricks and enhancements, seems to actually help this movie.  The effects presented are spartan, artfully done, and far from cheesy despite their bargain-basement cost.  The brooding mysterious device at the center of the plot is utterly mundane in aspect: a few wires, gauges, disks, boxes, ominously humming, or revving into a grating screech of feedback --- just enough to present the convincing illusion of a jury-rigged garage invention.

If you don't mind a few spoilers, read on. Otherwise, go to the last paragraph.

Primer is hard SF, in that plausible (if speculative) scientific rules put up a palpable resistance to what can happen.  The machine, for all its wonder, is slow, grinding, and tedious to use, dangerous in subtle unknown ways.  There is no magic, at least not for the user, who can ""pop"" back to the past only at the expense of long hours of boredom or drugged somnolence in a ""coffin,"" exposed to God-knows-what forces. The machine takes ingenuity and work to construct, serendipity to discover its attributes, time and sweat to work out its potential.  The pair work out, a posteriori, a  plausible theory for the time travel effect --- plausible in that the laws of thermodynamics are not broken (maybe bent a bit), and plausible in that they can express it in a diagram, allowing the viewer to buy into the rules of play.  But the theory is clearly incomplete: it can't, for example, account for the small but increasingly corrosive changes inflicted on their physiology, and perhaps their sanity, with each use.  In every respect, the extent to which its dangers are unknowable is itself an unknown quantity.

The characters are flawed, average (if clever) human beings.  Stumbling upon a device of unfathomable potential, their budding ambitions are pathetically petty.  The wisest human on earth would be flummoxed at the logical and moral implications of their invention.  These guys' first impulses are to attempt to beat the stock market, or, later, to time-engineer a perfect heroic moment, for gratitude and praise.  Faced with a new world of fathomless potential, power, and complexity, they respond with personal greed and vainglory.  Very human.  Very familiar.

The world --- our world --- after discovery of the time device will be changed beyond all recognition, in ways that defy enumeration or categorization (""The permutations were endless""). We viewers only witness the tiniest fraction of the beginning of --- what?  What will causality be when the consequences of actions you have yet to perform double back to the present and bite you in the a__ (a la Grainger).  How many histories will the world go through?  Most of these histories would conceivably never leave any trace, since ""the last revision is the one that counts.""  Occasionally a character (like the narrator?) will find himself become a relic, sandwiched between timelines, who survives to tell his tale.  Will there be battles between ""forces of Aaron"" and ""forces of Abe?""  Will there be armies of human copies of copies?  How physically or mentally blurred and distorted will they become as errors propagate down these strings of copied real-life ""images""? Who else will find out the secret? And what in Tophet will the world look like when such machines become widely available?  Could a stable solution to the resulting worldwide iterative crazy-quilt process of timeline one-upmanship possibly evolve, or would history fractionate into a hopeless tangle of time loops and broken symmetries, expanding chaotically into the space-time continuum? An era of fractal history?  Or something there is not even a word for?

Primer has been compared to Stanley Kubrik's and Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odessey.  While the differences between these movies (budget being the most obvious one) are too numerous to count, I can put my finger on the similarity.  There is a feeling at the end of Primer that the author has opened a Pandora's box in our heads, with ramifications as awesome, limitless, and potentially terrifying, as those symbolized by the 2001 ""Star Child.""  The technology has taken humanity to a tipping point, and nothing will ever be the same.  Even ""ever"" will never be the same.  The feeling stays with us, long after we have fried our brains working out the movie's timeline convolutions and logical conundrums, teasing our reality at the edges of awareness and imagination.",1192406400,14,5365,5.079908675799087

I started to give this movie 4 stars only because the sound is so bad you have to keep hitting rewind to get all of the dialogue. But considering the reward for actually putting forth the effort, 5 is still appropriate. I will not give a synopsis of the plot because it's been done by other reviewers, and anyway there's no good way to describe this completely unique plot. The point is that this movie makes you think, on many levels. I will NEVER get the mathematical/parabolic conundrum figured out, but as fun as it is to try, it's the moral and social ideas that are the most intriguing.

I've heard the movie criticized for lack of character development. Personally, I see this as a stroke of genius. Since I don't know Abe's or Aaron's backgrounds, they become 2 sides of the same ""everyman"" coin. When I look at Aaron, I am at first comforted and then gradually spooked to realize that he could be anyone--my next-door neighbor, or even myself. As for Abe, it wasn't until I really started relating to him that I saw his flaws.

It won the annual Sundance award (over ""Garden State""), and is a 70-minute time travel movie that will blow your mind with the possibilities. It's written (and acted) by a methodical, analytical engineer type, so it's uncommonly smart: This is more ""Scientific American"" than ""Twilight Zone"". Best of all, the dialogue, film style, and feel of it has this realism to it that few tech films have ever captured. The engineer inventors never talk down to the audience; instead, the viewer is an eavesdropper and races to keep up with their techno-talk. The time travel ideas are so intricate that they have spawned web sites and forum discussions of their own (it takes repeated viewings to figure out what actually happened, but unlike ""Donnie Darko"", it does indeed make sense). But it's certainly more demanding (and slow) than standard time travel dramas. So, don't expect to really ""enjoy"" the movie until you watch it the second time.",1181001600,5,1058,4.916201117318436

The intricate plot and intelligent execution of it make this film work.  I generally dislike indie films, as they all fall into the same formula.  They are either quirky, silly, or done for shock value.  This is a real film done with a purpose other than being just a little bit different from Hollywood, but not too much.

I was trying to understand why this film wasn't huge in art theatres, and I think it's because a lot of people into art film really don't get technology or technologists.  The ""emotional"" moments I think are brilliantly done, speaking as a real geek.",1172620800,6,613,4.648148148148148
2220995,5,B0007N1JC8,"Primer, from first time writer/director Shane Carruth (who also produced, edited, scored, and stars in the film), is an intense, thought-provoking, and mesmerizing analysis of two young scientists, Abe and Aaron, and their creation of...something. I won't spoil it here, as a large portion of the intrigue is derived from attempting to understand what the characters are creating. This proves rather tricky at first, as the boys rabble back and forth in overly technical dialogue, and though some aspects are lost in translation, enough slips through to excite the audience as they come to the startling realization of what is actually transpiring.

The film opens with four young men dressed in suits working in a garage. We are greeted with a voice over of an unknown character demanding our attention. While this is a great way to bring us into the film, it may prove unnecessary, as our eyes, ears and minds will be firmly immersed in the world of Primer. This is a film where every frame unapologetically demands every ounce of attention within our bodies, especially if we hope to uncover the enigmatic puzzle playing out on screen. Each scene ratchets up the tension as the protagonists and the audience are drawn towards the stunning climax, figuring out pieces of the big picture in the process.

The style of the film is palpable, presenting an extremely sterile and almost alien world that the two boys work and thrive in. There is a noticeable inhumanity in the boys, both in their haphazard actions and general perspectives on existence. Through description, the washed out suburban houses and storage facilities sound extremely monotonous, yet there is such a sense of style and importance placed in every frame that the set pieces become fascinating rather than boring. It never even approaches looking like a film shot for $7,000, which is an amazing accomplishment on the part of the filmmakers.

The characters, all first time actors, do admirable enough jobs with the roles presented. Don't expect any standout performances or amazing characters, though, as this isn't a film about traditional human interaction. The dialogue, while extremely technical, is also incredibly intelligent and realistic. It does for technical dialogue what Quentin Tarantino did for witty dialogue (though I doubt we will see dozens of Primer knockoffs).

The musical accompaniment is another highlight of the film. Melancholy piano and toned down techno beats highlight the tracks, providing a decent job pacing the beats and at times ramping up the intensity of particular scenes. The most effective use of the score lays with the haunting piano, which plays out through the course of the film, a fantastic accompaniment to the scientific nature of the film.

Primer is a film that has people talking (at least those few people who actually did see it). It is a film that never spoon feeds the audience, though it does place the food within reach. The audience must be an active participant to take it and discover the true greatness of Primer. And for some, that will be a major turn-off. For those that do immerse themselves within the film, though, they will be rewarded with an extremely thought-provoking meditation on desire and time, on science and ethics, on reality and perception.

Primer won the Grand Jury Prize of the Sundance Film Festival of 2004, though it never received mainstream theatrical release because of the short run time (77 Minutes).

When all is said and done, what does Primer accomplish? Quite a bit, actually. It is an intelligent, thought-provoking, intense, and entertaining film. It proves that this truly is the age where anyone can make a great film if they have the talent. And, most importantly, it put the science back into science fiction.",1172188800,,3780,5.048076923076923
2220996,4,B0007N1JC8,"TRESCA-PRIME: Primer is a no-frills science fiction film that details a realistic portrayal of time travel.  Like Donnie Darko, it examines what happens when humans discover they can influence time...and then just how little control they really have over it.  Aaron (Shane Carruth) and Abe (David Sullivan) struggle to create a magnetic invention in their garage, only to stumble upon time travel.  And once Pandora's Box is opened, there's no going back.  In no time (pun intended), they're sending themselves into the past.  This leads to a perpetual struggle to avoid paradoxes that most time travel stories don't consider. When duplicate cell phones are in the same time stream, which one rings first? Can you really avoid changing the outcome of reality simply by avoiding your prime self? And who is really the ""first"" prime anyway?  The film explores all these possibilities, which makes it an interesting ""what-if"" scenario that exponentially spins more and more questions. That said, I have to admit that my first viewing of Primer wasn't all that favorable.  The dialogue sounds like it came out of Clerks, the film is often grainy and choppy, and there's almost no action whatsoever throughout the script.  Perhaps my future selves will have a different opinion.

TRESCA-2: On second viewing, the term ""Primer"" takes on new meaning.  Primer can mean an introductory textbook, and indeed we discover that Aaron was providing a guideline for future events to his Prime self--in other words, a textbook of sorts as to how to relive his life again without causing a paradox.  Primer can also mean white paint, used coat something for the first time.  As Aaron discovers he can go back in time, he begins to whitewash events, making himself look like a hero and giving himself the best possible outcomes.  But are these changes merely cosmetic, like paint?  Finally, there's the notion of Primer as an explosive, setting off a disastrous chain of events.  And the end of the film leaves us with the certainty that something very bad is about to happen.

TRESCA-4: Another alternative my former selves hadn't thought of was Primer as being first and primary.  Once Aaron discovers the ability to create multiple versions of himself, he becomes increasingly obsessed with controlling them.  And of course, each Aaron in the past feels exactly the same way. So how do you become the prime?  How do you become the person who is control of your own destiny?  How do you become your own God? Aaron and Abe (Abraham) are Biblical names and their inclusion is certainly not an accident.

TRESCA-8: Seeing the movie again really makes you appreciate exactly how much work went into crafting Primer.  Dialogue and scenes that seem odd and disjointed make perfect sense when you realize it's the time doubles tweaking the timeline. The more duplicates that get involved, the more the film becomes fuzzy and unfocused, a sometimes annoying but important visual cue.  And always there is the suspicion that something is off, from the ""rats in the attic"" to Abe waking up laying face down on the floor, to the fact that Aaron doesn't want to ""talk to those kids who hang out"" with Abe.  Why?  Multiple viewings tie it together.

TRESCA-16: Primer is probably one of the most realistic portrayals of time travel science in recent memory, but that doesn't necessarily make it an engaging film.  Primer strains our patience.  Most of the time, the characters stand around chatting with each other from innovative camera angles.  The climactic moment, a scene where an ex-boyfriend shows up with a shotgun at a party, is never even shown.  And the grainy footage, the monotone dialogue, the talking-over-each-other style of acting, all make the film seem more like a reality show than a movie.  It doesn't have the slick sensibilities of Donnie Darko or the neatly wrapped storyline of Groundhog Day.  And yet, the nihilistic outcome of the film is too powerful to ignore, sticking with you through multiple future viewings.

In short, Primer is both a fantastic piece of thoughtful science fiction and a challenging viewing experience.  By all means watch it.  You owe it to your future selves.",1171152000,28,4183,4.96978417266187

Imagine four Silicon Valley techno-geeks talking simultaneously into barely functioning mikes and you have Primer.  The plot, such as it is, has also traveled through time, revisit old episodes of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone to see for yourself.

On its face, the premise of time travel and the creation of alternate selves, manipulating or not manipulating events and thereby tinkering with the smooth continuum, would seem to be promising.  While it does prompt rather grandiose philosophical questions, (questions that exceed the grasp of Mr. Carruth who wrote, directed, starred, scored, edited, and painted the props), it defeats its purpose because there are simply too many possibilities.  Drama depends on well-defined situations and tension, in the silly-putty world of Primer, where anything can happen; there is no definition, tension, or suspense.

Normally, when I learn that plucky kids made a movie for $7,000 I cheer, because Hollywood needs to know that big money does not equal quality.  (Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle is a stellar example of film excellence on a shoestring budget.)  When I hear that a film is a Sundance winner, I'm immediately interested because this often points me towards movies that are small, overlooked, and wonderful.  But no system is foolproof, and Primer snuck through the cracks.

For a mature look at time manipulation that does provide meaningful structure, try Last Year At Marienbad, Memento, or even Lost Highway.  Marienbad and Memento are brilliant, and Highway, while it leans heavily on signature Lynch weirdness to make its point, at least provides the visceral impact thoroughly lacking in Primer.

2221004,5,B0007N1JC8,"PRIMER - Secrets to the Film's Success

By Keith Alan Morris

PRIMER is a perfect example of what you can do with a little bit of money, a good idea, and plenty of prep time. For those not in the know, PRIMER is the hot new indie that has already developed a significant buzz and loyal cult following akin to The Blair Witch Project, El Mariachi, Memento, Pi, et al. The difference is: this one's smarter than all of them combined. It is the brainchild of former engineer turned filmmaker Shane Carruth from Texas, and is about two engineers who accidentally create a time machine in their garage. Shane's story is already the stuff of legend in the indie world: unhappy engineer quits job, teaches himself filmmaking, and makes a $7000 film that wins Sundance, gets distribution and secures a 2 million budget for his next film. PRIMER has become, for Shane, a near perfect calling card for the cerebral, art house sci-fi director. Many a filmmaker is, at once, jealous and inspired by Carruth's savvy, as evidenced by a lengthy visit to the film's site (primermovie.com). There, film geeks are slugging it out-hotly debating whether the film is crap or genius, a testament to the film's ability to--God forbid--make you think. They all agree on one thing, however--it takes at least two viewings to begin to understand it.

Instead of another ""I loved it! I hated it"" review that you can find links to on your own via the film's lively ""forum"" section, I am going to focus on what makes the film such an incredible achievement for a first time filmmaker, what Shane does correctly behind the scenes and where this film historically fits into the indie equation. That is, what it means for the filmmaker in all of us.

After El Mariachi (1992), many expected to see copycats of the winning formula: (super) 16mm films significantly prepped and storyboarded to a ""T""-then shot in 1 or 2 takes, shipped to fests and distribs, and seen worldwide by an endearing public hungry for something different. But it never happened. Where were they--the geniuses that would save American filmmaking and start a new Renaissance? Enter Shane--a guy outside of filmmaking. An engineer.

But what did he do right? Attached are the secrets to his success, a sort of ""primer"" for the industry...

1. After he finished the film, he went to L.A. for a few weeks, just picked up the phone books and started calling. The difference: he kept calling. He contacted 100 people a day for a week-agents, managers, and reps in LA. Why? Because he was once told that ""it's important to have one of those."" His indomitable spirit proves that, once again, you make your own breaks when you believe in something.

2, That helped in meeting people at Sundance.

3. At Sundance, when the bidding war began and he wasn't happy with giving up so many rights, he walked away. Not out of arrogance, out of respect for the film and the actors and crew. This showed he meant business.

4. He held strong and secured a deal he was happy with, but it was a long month after the dream makers in Park City had packed their bags and headed back to their warmer climes. (That month must've felt like years.)

5. Technically and creatively, he practiced ""a hundred times"" before he photographed--mostly using just one or two takes.

6. He embraced techno babble in the film, which, arguably, gives the film an air of believability. He didn't dumb-down the dialogue for a broader market.

7. He scored his own film. The tone is reminiscent of THX-1138--using sounds as music.

8. He uses the jump cut effectively. And except for one nighttime interior car scene, his lighting works. El Mariachi, however, hardly used lights, which makes Primer quite the achievement.

9. He didn't dumb-down the editing. It's super tight. Scenes are missing purposefully. It's masterful editing for a rookie.

10. He uses real people effectively, not actors. In interviews, he says he saw 100 actors but that they were all ""acting."" Not ""being""-the crucial missing element in most acting.

11. He spent one full year writing the script.

PRIMER, admittedly, is not for everyone. Many raised on Hollywood fare from their local Cineplex will dismiss it as ""too difficult"" or ""choppy storytelling."" But Shane swears everything is in there and I believe it for this one reason: its ingenuity is that the film is told in the cut, not in the camera move--something missing from today's storytellers. It is economical in shot selection and pacing and keeps your riveted to the screen. It is also economical in budget. He says he would've loved to have had 3 grand more--how 3G would've made such a difference. You just gotta root for a guy who says that, and now has 2M to play with for his next one. Oh, how suddenly things change...

PRIMER is not without its faults. The eyelines were off sometimes. A few medium shots were slightly too tight. Some shots could've been more uninflected. Too many dolley shots for an already-heady movie. A big problem: it can leave you yearning for more on the morality of it all and less on the specifics. It sometimes feels like a film for engineers, by an engineer. But to pick apart such a solid film is petty. Remember, because he didn't have any money, each shot was only given 1 or 2 takes and this is a complex film here, with complex dialogue. This alone is a testament that the film works wonders. And it's all done by a first time filmmaker. Is it worth 154 minutes of your life? (77 minutes times 2 viewings.)

You better believe it.

It is definitely true that you will have to watch it at least twice to get it all, but I am not sure you will want to after the first viewing....I didn't. This is a movie that had great potential, but in my opinion it never reached it. You may disagree.

I don't mind depth and intricacy in a movie plot, or even a little misdirection in order to keep it exciting (e.g. Sixth Sense), but I do mind confusion. And it was not just confusing, in the end, despite a nice attempt and maybe a few moments of drama, to me it was just plain boring. Alot of my boredom may just be attributable to the minimalist approach to this whole movie, nevertheless, it bored me. It relied to heavily on the story and the acting, neither of which were bad, but not nearly good enough to make up for the lack of visual interest in this movie.",1154908800,10,923,4.127777777777778
2221016,1,B0007N1JC8,"What looks like a good movie to watch quickly turns into disappointment. Whilst you expect some plot to come together (at least on first viewing) - it is strung together to confuse - even to frustrate the viewer.

I was given no warning about the really really bad quality. Having a HD Large display does not help either. The sound is annonying as is irritating. In fact I got a refund on the movie hire!

I don't expect overboard special effect and CGI overlays. I expected the quality to be above a cheap CAM recorder however.

The plot is complicated and the noise in the background adds to the disorientation which is done on purpose.

On the other note: The cheap and nasty props do not add anything to crediblility either.

Stay clear - but if you have the time and want to view the movie - settle back and expect a ""student"" movie from some high School college.

This movie although good in concept fails. I would like some production house to take it on board - create the situation with some convinving special effects (to help the storyline), better sound, widescreen and convincing props.

While reading the reviews of the the many folk who said they had to watch it twice or more, a thought occured to me. I felt that one of the effects this film has is to purposely have you relive the film again just as the characters exprience the prior time again. You are almost like the characters in the film going back to an earlier time (the beginning of the film) and learning(a kind of changing) yourselves. Since I didn't see the film (or listen to the commentary) I really don't know if this was the directors intention, but that a film about time make you want to (go back) watch it again, is rather facinating.

The dialog is a little tech-heavy, but the concept of time travel as it is explained in the film is completely plausible, if not entirely believable.

I have always believed that true science fiction is not an end in itself; it is simply a means to an end, a method used by a writer or director to shine a light on human nature and compel us to take a closer look at ourselves. This movie definitely falls into that category.

Some may find this film a bit slow and may not like the fact that it demands more than one viewing to be fully appreciated, but I believe most true sci-fi fans will love it.",1153267200,8,777,4.426573426573427

I simply listened and pondered at the ""endless permutations"" that were possible.  I also knew that I would watch the film again immediately.

It's a richly rewarding film upon repeated viewings and I didn't find this arduous but instead quite a pleasurable fact of the film.

2221031,5,B0007N1JC8,"For the first 40-45 minutes of this film, my mouth was continuously agape at the things the two engineers discovered as they built their time machine.

For the rest of the film, I was completely bewildered.

Undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi films to come out so far in 2000.  And what made it good was that it wasn't a big-budget movie.  With almost zero special effects (I think the scene with the cellphone call toward the end is an effect), the director nonetheless conveys everything we need to know.  Had this film been produced by, say, Jerry Bruckheimer or someone of his ilk, there would've been countless CG shots of people moving through time, trails running behind them, and at the end, a big fight with explosions.

Also, the homebrewed soundtrack provides the right amount of tension at the right times.  As an audio person, I know how important sound is to a film.  The wrong music can completely ruin things.  For example:  in ""The Incredibles"", after the plane gets blown up and mom makes a boat to carry Violet while Dash propels it -- that music is light enough to say ""see, we can get out of anything"".  But had it been done in a darker tone, we would've been scared out of our wits that everyone was going to die, even in an animated Disney/Pixar film.  The same thing here:  a sweeping orchestrated soundtrack could not have conveyed the feelings that simple piano tracks evoked.

I still don't understand the ending.  But that's part of what makes it good.  I've seen it compared to ""Pi"", but at least in this one no one takes a power drill to anyone's head.",1145664000,5,1582,4.5371024734982335
2221032,4,B0007N1JC8,"'Primer' is a film about that most famed and classic sci-fi concept, time travel.  Many films about time travel simply use it as a plot device, a way to get their characters to a different age, but 'Primer' is one of those works that's interested in the concept of time travel in and of itself, and the complications and paradoxes inherent in such activities.  Needless to say, it doesn't explain or resolve these concerns, indeed they can't be resolved, but it does result in a very interesting, dense film.  Like many, probably most viewers of the film, I wasn't entirely sure what had happened as the film ended the first time around.  I got a better, much more certain grip on it after watching it a second time, and I actually think the movie became a bit less interesting when it's more fully understood, but it's still an intriguing web.

The film opens by introducing us to 4 young engineer types who work together on side projects in their spare time.  Frankly, we don't know too much of what they're actually doing, we just watch them work for a while as the group is pared down to two central figures, Abe and Aaron, who create a strange new invention, which they contain in a small steel box.  Even they're not entirely sure what it is or what it does, but their experimenting with it reveals that objects contained within the box are removed from the conventional timeline, and they eventually discover that this device can allow them to travel backwards in time.  The rest of the film shows us the difficulties that come from their experimenting with the machine.  These opening sections alone will doubtless scare some people off, as they're filled with techspeak. It's not as hard to understand as some would have you believe, but maybe I just let the words and concepts I'm unfamiliar with fly by with out concern because, in the end, this stuff doesn't much matter.  They are making.... something, somehow.  How they do it doesn't matter all that much, it's just a play to sell you on the reality of the film and draw you in, and it worked for me, anyway.

The time machines themselves are intriguingly different from what you'd usually see in a modern sci-fi film.  Again, they're just boxes, and you travel backwards in time simply by sitting in them after they've heated up.  Furthermore, you only move backwards in real time, i.e. you get in the box at 6 P.M. and stay there for 6 hours and it's now noon.  This sort of time travel is amusingly mundane, allowing for simple practical problems and benefits, and forcing the characters to continuously deal with potential timeline deviations as they're living through an immediate past where their past self currently exists.  Thus, it comes down to living the same day twice, the first time around planning it all out, the second time reaping the benefits.  Of course, the short timeline means that they aren't allowed to advance particularly ambitious goals, not much beyond making money on the stock market, but Writer/Director/Actor/Everything Shane Carruth does a good exploring the sort of complications related to such short distance time travel, and this is where the major intrigue of the film comes in.  For example, Aaron, at one point, brings his cell phone with him on one of their trips, and it rings.  This begs the question, is the time symmetry affected?  Is his other cell phone also ringing?  They don't know.  They also note small, amusing points, like how the storage unit security guard always sees them come in to gain access to the time machine, but never sees them come out, and how they must, the first time thru the day, bring in an extra car in the morning to the storage facility, as the car that they take there won't actually be there yet when they get out.  Obviously, the potential complications of time travel have been considered before, but you usually don't see this kinda contemplation in a film, and it felt relatively new and different to me, anyway.  And, again, it's interesting to see a film with simple, everyday concerns related to time travel rather than just the bigger overlying concepts.

The film can be quite difficult to follow, as it, for the most part, simply moves forward in the later timelines of the film, rather than just showing us the very first, original timeline and then the various permutations.  For example, we see that Abe has traveled back in time before we learn that they have the ability to do so--  After all, he traveled back in time to *before* he was actually was able to do so in order to discuss it with Aaron, so this is the scene that we actually watch.  This also allows for some unanswered questions which are legitimately left unanswered.  For example,  at one point they notice that one Mr. Granger has used the time machine and now has a double, but neither they nor us knows why. Again, they haven't told him about it *yet*, so why would they know?  Eventually things spiral out of control, as Aaron and Abe have ideas about manipulating the past beyond simply cheating at the stock market, and they grow paranoid and lose their trust for one another and so on, leading to problems relating to maintaining the timeline and dealing with doubles and so on.  I won't go in to too many specifics, and while the final third of the picture can be tough to follow it is, again, interesting.

This film was really shot on the cheap.  Reportedly a miniscule $7,000.  It's a fairly professional affair considering that, cleanly and competently shot, and with acceptable acting.  (Fortunately, the film is very staid, with the characters generally discussing things in a calm manner, thus requiring little real acting or emoting).  The picture is pretty damn grainy at times, and the sound isn't always too hot, but it's never painful to watch, and even has some nice cinematography at moments.

Yeah, this is a neat film.  I don't think it's quite the mind puzzle that most people make it out to be, though I certainly don't claim to be 100% sure of everything that happened, but it's definitely a lot more dense and intriguing than the vast majority of the films out there. (I must also note, however, that I don't really think that everything is supposed to tie itself together cleanly and clearly, no matter how carefully you look at it.  Indeed, the fact that it can't all be put together is the major point, and that the situation has become to complicated to be surely dissected.)  Definitely worth a look if this is your kinda thing.

Ignore these people.  Here's what you'll find in Primer:

The mother of all movie puzzles.  You'll have to watch this thing a couple of times.  If that bothers you for some egotistical reason, then don't watch it.  If you feel that all movies should spoon feed you every single idea and plot process, then don't watch it.  But, if you're determined to figure something out...watch and love!

Coolest dialogue in history.  These guys sound like they're actually talking, not giving us one lined zingers from a script.  Granted, the dialogue gets techy...but that didn't bother me at all.  There are some gems hidden in the script if you already have a good understanding of techy-speak...but it's not important for you to grasp the puzzle.

Best use of U-Haul in a movie.

The reason this movie was SO good, is because it was SO far from a typical sci-fi movie. The script was solid, enticing, intriguing, and the actors delivered all of their lines (it seems) almost flawlessly. There were periods of overlapping dialogue, yes, but it was very natural and still intense.

I don't know why people expect to have everything handed to them in a movie... I much prefer to have at least some unknown that requires some brainpower. A movie doesn't have to explain everything to you.

Art is supposed to be thought-provoking, and leave you with an inquisitive urge. That is EXACTLY what this movie does. It will take at least 2 or more viewings before you really get a grasp on what's happening, and why its happening.

Basically, this film inspired some slightly obsessive behavior-but in the best way possible.

There were a few loose ends that I would have liked to see tied up and I must admit that the movie ended very abruptly and without a conclusive explanation of what happens to Abe, but I can't complain about the concept.  I think that at the rate we are advancing in the technology field along-side the good old twenty to thirty year gap between when new advances in science, medicide, weapons, ect., are discorvered or created, verses the time in which we, the public, are introduced to the idea, leads me to believe that this concept is not far from a reality now or in the near future.  The reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 was becasue of the comments I mentioned above about loose ends.

Primer deals with a simple human experience that can only be expressed with some weird literary device, in this case it's time travel.  If you could have some slight omniprescience, what would it be like?

I want movies that let me see how these little thought experiments work out, at least one writer or director's vision of it.

2221064,1,B0007N1JC8,"Primer is one of those films that starts off by unloading a ton of what can only be called irrelevant information on you. And just when you think you might get a break, it keeps right along doing so. This is a movie that is cheaply made. Fine. The real problem is it is not made for even intelligent moviegoers. This is a film for engineers and very smart engineers at that. I think this movie should come with a warning at the top that says so. I am angered after watching just half of this movie.

I expect movies to do one of two things for me: entertain or enlighten (the great ones do both). Primer did neither. It was way too cheaply made to entertain -- although there are some small filming tricks like Aaron's wife's face being obscured in the first scene to add to the feeling that she is not important to our two lead characters at this time. The soundtrack isn't bad either -- and also the dialogue was way too fast and annoying to properly follow. While I know there are some movies you can't know every single thing that's going on without repeated viewings, this film was bloody ridiculous. I watch a lot of movies, everything from sci-fi (Aeon Flux) to Scottish Drama (Young Adam) (Dear Frankie) to Australian Drama/Action (Heaven's Burning) to French Drama (The Dreamlife of Angels) to the Harry Potter films.

2221065,3,B0007N1JC8,"Software engineer-turned-film director Shane Carruth shows one brilliant idea in `Primer': What if you can go back to yesterday, or any time in the past, using a time machine? Usually in the films based on time-traveling idea such as `Back to the Future' series, the time travelers (who go back to the past) do not meet themselves while staying in the past (themselves before time-traveling), and in this way the filmmakers avoid the confusing storytelling process that must follow the consequences of, say, Marty A meeting Marty B. What would happen if Marty in `BTTF' Part 1 looks up, and finds himself Marty in `BTTF' Part 2 looking down at him? Is it possible? If possible, how can you show it on screen, inevitable results affecting the entire series?

`Primer' does this brave thing. The low-budget is basically about two young engineers Aaron and Abe who invented a time machine in their small garage. Instead of selling the license of techniques to major company (which I would love to do in their place), Abe and Aaron decide to conceal their invention from the public, and use it to make money. The idea is simple: investment in stock market. Get the right information about the market today, travel back to yesterday, and buy the right ones in the market.

But this method inevitably produces (sort of) TWO Aarons and TWO Abes at the same time. It produces `doubles' or `alternatives' of Aaron and Abe. Now here is a question. What if one of the `doubles' starts to act on his own? What if the double gets another `double' using the machine while the original is unaware of his move?

The premise sounds incredible, but very intriguing. But for all its fantastic concept, Shane Carruth made one mistake in making the film, and that is the script. To follow what is going on, we need a detailed chart of Abe and Aaron written by someone who can explain all the moves of the two characters, including their `doubles.' One viewing of the film is not enough, perhaps merely allowing you understand the 30 per cent of the story, and that is what happened to me. Now I read the many comments on the net, and that finally became 70 per cent. You might say you have to see the film at least five times. Yes, you are right. But why not make it `three times' or less?

`The Primer' uses frequently high-tech jargons, which are slightly off-putting, but that is not a big problem. The film's production designs are frankly amateurish, and the time machine looks like a small box made of brown cardboard, but I can happily ignore those things. But I certainly didn't like sitting as a totally bemused audience in the dark, trying to think, `Is this my fault or not?'

I like the film's bleak outlook on the idea of time traveling, and its challenging attitudes to make us think. Shane Carruth has succeeded in doing the latter, I think, for many viewers, including me, still find the mind-bending puzzle very intriguing after watching it.

Thankfully free from an overt attempt to try to articulate the technical solution to time travel, the movie deals with the progressive temptations the friends face as they plunge deeper into a dizzying map of future-past interdependencies. They make the expected exploitation of the stock market but their dabblings with the relationship between future and past and present begin to be concerned with friends and family.  As they do this, the movie becomes increasingly confusing due to the complexities of the causalities and changes they are working in the lives of other people.

Script The script is pretty solid, especially considering the complexity of the story line.  The dialogue is natural, to the point where I wondered if most of it was improvised.

Acting and Character Development Surprisingly good.  The two primary characters play off each other well.  Their dialogue together is natural and real.  They have a best-friend chemistry together.

Cinematography and Editing The cinematography is remarkable for a low budget independent movie.  The color is great, the composition is creative and it helps tell the story.  It does this by creating uncertainty in the time frame during their iterations of time travel.  Toward the last third of the movie, the editing becomes very confusing: the protagonists are shuffling their time trips and this makes the storyline difficult to follow.  I say this is good because I think that was the intent.  They wanted to convey that there was complexity and uncertainty associated the implications of time travel.  The audience is confused because they are confused and uncertain.

The movie is compelling.  I kept thinking throughout the movie how remarkable it was that it was such a well made movie.  The acting, the concept, the script... it all comes together to create a compelling movie.  Yes, it is not clear and confusing.

Look, let me tell you a story.

About ten years ago, I was into John Steinbeck.  I read many of his novels: Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, To A God Unknown, Of Mice and Men, The Winter of Our Discontent, Tortilla Flat, Cannery Row, The Pearl, Acts of King Arthur.

So, have you ever read The Grapes of Wrath?  Man, it's not a pleasant read.  Ponderous is the world that comes to mind.  I finish the novel on Thanksgiving weekend.  I happen to be sick from food poisoning due to some lovely Wendy's food.  The incessant dry heaves only added to the monotony of The Grapes of Wrath.  When I finished the book, I tossed it down and said, ""Man, that was ponderous.""  And then I realized the brilliance of Steinbeck.  He wanted me to feel what the intinerant farmers felt.

<u>Primer</u> is confusing because that's what the two men felt.  It's confusing to you because it was confusing to them.",1131840000,101,2876,4.949790794979079

Ultimately, I still wish I could truly go back in time -- and NOT see this horrendous excuse for a movie.  But let me tell you why:

The audio was beyond horrible,... it was confoundingly bad. All the background noise, cars passing by outside the house, and other stuff totally unrelated to the movie, were always louder than the dialogue.  But that was the GOOD news, inasmuch as the dialoge was much much WORSE than I could have believed possible.  This was without a doubt the longest and most unenjoyable 77 minutes I have endured in a very long time.

(Sci-Fi lovers should watch ""Crimson Rivers"" a Jean Reno film I have reviewed on Amazon.  ""Event Horizon"" is another fine movie.  And if a 'time-travel' flick is the only thing that will satisfy you, save yourself and just pick any one other than this)

 ""Primer"" was not unlike sitting all day in a barbershop frequented entirely by very old retirees and listening to them rambling, ad nauseum, about nothing. At once having nothing to say, yet constantly and endlessly talking. Failing to hold to one banal theme from beginning to end of each boring and long-running sentence. Or in the rare instance of getting onto something seeming to be remotely of interest, forgetting halfway through the sentence what they'd been talking about in the first place and going on to something else.

I died a thousand times during this movie, but sadly the folks who made it kept traveling back in time and reviving me so as to force me to go on! This movie would justify the government in requiring a license for the ownership or possession of a camera. For it is proof that not everybody should be allowed to have one.

Someone should go back in time and track down the grandparents of everyone responsible for Primer and sterilize their ancestors at birth, so that this awful nightmare could be prevented in it's entirety.

Always a lover of science fiction, I have seen many a time-travel movie, most of them bad, some of them very bad. In choosing to see Primer, my thought was, ""It might be good. Besides, how bad could it be?"" Let me tell you, for seventy seven minutes time nearly stood still, so that when finally I had reached the end and awakened from this horrific and painful nightmare, I felt I had aged about seventy seven DAYS.

Forget the death penalty. Take the worst criminals and strap them into a comfortable chair with their eyes taped open. Run an IV with chemicals to keep them awake forever.

After the tenth time, let them loose and they will surely gouge out their own eyeballs, stab their eardrums with pencils, weep endlessly and beg for mercy.",1129766400,9,2834,4.575098814229249

2221082,2,B0007N1JC8,"Shane Carruth's entry into the world of filmmaking makes you want to cheer for him.  For $7,000 -- if I understand correctly -- he's got an independent release that garnered him Independent Spirit Award nominations for Best Director & Best First Screenplay.  You want to cheer for the film because both Carruth and David Sullivan are nice looking leads who look as good in button-down shirts with ties as they do in their boxers crawling out of the big blue box.  Independent Spirit nominated blond David Sullivan for best debut performance.  Casey Gooden, Anand Upadhyaya & Carrie Crawford who round out the cast all have first time film credits.

The dynamic between the two leads is interesting as they consider the ethical considerations of issues at the same time they try to defraud the stock market.  What makes the family man Aaron played by Shane Carruth get on a plane and abandon his family came out of the blue for me and left me with contempt for the main character at the end of the film.

The cinema verite style of improvised-sounding dialogue and low-key emotions does grate on the viewer after awhile.  My wife fell asleep three times in the five different sittings it took us to be able to get through the DVD.  I agree with one professional reviewer that one of the greatest lines is, ""Are you hungry?  I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.""  I can usually follow the most complex plots, but did begin to fuzz in the last quarter of the film trying to keep up with just what they were trying to accomplish to keep the gunman from shooting at the party or why their beards had different growths.  So while the film does show promise for the filmmakers, it ultimately did not engage.  Actually, the trailers were more interesting than ""Primer.""

Most of the dialog and acting is superior to what you'd find in the usual Hollywood nonsense coming out these days; but beyond that, the elements that go into this film--innovative direction and acting, ongoing conversation, an unexpected result of experimentation (shades of Mary Shelley) taking place in a ho-hum daily setting--combine to give the viewer a sense of an unstoppable unraveling as the very fabric of Time comes apart one ordinary-seeming incident at a time.

I just watched the Director's commentary, and Shane Carruth does an admirable job of narrating what went into this film:  where this person comes from, that device, how this scene was shot, the score (he did it himself on a computer)....an incredible and yet modest display of talented filmmaking that comes to no pat conclusions, no heroic endings, but an expansion of possibility (if you went back in time half an hour, but your friend got ahead of you by five minutes, but you anticipated him with a backup time box, etc.) so disturbing, and yet so underplayed, that you are left wondering just how the bonds that hold friends and families together ever survive the collision with Promethean technics let loose in an attitude of adolescent irresponsibility.",1127088000,9,1283,5.0424528301886795

2221087,3,B0007N1JC8,"Primer (Shane Carruth, 2004)

There are, in general, two kinds of movies. There's the kind that spells everything out, either loading you up with information throughout the narrative or giving you everything at the end, like one of Agatha Christie's detectives in the drawing room, pipe in hand, laying out the criminal's activities for interested guests of the recently departed. The other kind of movie gives you just enough, and makes you work for the rest. I vastly prefer the second type of film.

Primer attempts to be the kind of movie that gives you just enough and has you make the rest of the connections in your head, but it falls short in a few places. Shot for just $7,000 (the same budget Robert Rodriguez had for El Mariachi; I've no idea if that will end up meaning anything, but look where Rodriguez is now), it's probably possible to forgive Primer a few of its various shortcomings; after all, with seven grand, you're not going to have a lot of technical wizardry to play with. (One is tempted to draw parallels between the filmmaker shooting for seven grand and the character played by the filmmaker, an inventor who's constantly out of money. One will resist.) What's not forgivable for seven grand are the movie's two main failings. The first is that the script could have used another draft or two; the second is that, as I mentioned before, there are a few places in the movie where we could have been given more detail, enough for us to figure it all out. (I know I'm not alone in not being able to grasp it; I read reviews as well as write them.)

The movie revolves around four guys, Aaron, Abe, Robert, and Philip, who by day are drones in corporate America, and by night are fledgling inventors. They've been fledgling inventors forever; they develop a lot of products that are great for niche markets, but have yet to come up with anything that will allow them to quit their jobs and live in the lap of luxury, etc. Then Abe comes up with a machine capable of allowing time travel, and he and Aaron start experimenting.

""Ah,"" you say, ""but what happened to Robert and Philip?"" That's the rub. They are conveniently written out of the script during the middle third of the movie (Aaron and Abe bar their access to the garage where the four work by telling them that it's being sprayed for bugs and no one's allowed in), only popping back in at the end for a bit in order to remind the viewer that the director hasn't forgotten about them altogether. Also, Abe and Aaron's significant others appear only when a question needs asked or some seemingly-innocuous tidbit (read: foreshadowing) needs added to the mix. The convenience factor of minor characters is something that has always bugged me; your mileage may vary.

As for not quite getting enough, it seems as if the film goes in jags on how it delivers this. During the first part of the movie, when we have more than Aaron and Abe in almost every scene, we get a realistic, but very confusing, depiction of four geeks inventing something-- everyone's talking all at once, and the viewer will never be able to follow it. Even the subtitler, who did a patchy job at best anyway, just gives up most of the time in scenes with simultaneous speech; there are, simply, no subtitles to be had there. (This is one of those films that you need to watch in English with English subtitles, so you can marvel at how things get lost in translation even when it's the same language in two different media.) As the film progresses, we can actually hear the characters well enough, but things start to get more complex. Actually, ""start"" isn't really a good word to use there; things begin complex, and get more so. I know graduate students who can't make heads or tails of the movie's final quarter-hour. The rest of us... well, we just have to wing it.

The fact that Shane Carruth, who had no screenwriting, directing, or acting experience wrote, directed, starred, and SCORED this film and made the whole thing for $7000 is almost too much to believe. I would give it 5 stars, but the first time I saw it I missed the first 10-15 minutes, and when I bought the film I realized that the movie could have done without most of it.",1126137600,3,410,4.407894736842105

The best thing about this film is that its not obvious for the viewer to get what is going on, it is subtle and really works your mind in a good way. You really need to think about what is going on. I have watched this film probably at least 10 times.  And each time I started to get more of the subtle pieces of the story along with it's many nuances. I am not going to go into the whole storyline and plot of this film, because there are so many people who have arleady done that, and it would be redundant for me to do that. The film was made by an engineer who decided he wanted to make a film based on an interesting subject, but more subtle than anyone else that has attempted to make of this subject. So he decided to read a lot of books on film, pre-production, production and postproduction which really helped in the long run, eventually he made this film and ended up winning a award at sundance. It was really inspiring for me to learn about his past and successes, his determination.

The technical jargon and overlapping dialog didn't bother me (I'm an engineer myself), and the premise of accidentally inventing a time machine is promising. But the second half of the film becomes increasingly disjointed and incoherent as the paradoxes pile up, and by the end I was completely lost. Assuming the story DOES actually make sense, I suppose it might be untangled by repeated viewing, but I'm not inclined to bother ... I've read dozens of time paradox stories, and this one just isn't very interesting. (Try David Gerrold's THE MAN WHO FOLDED HIMSELF for an example of how to do it well.)

Much is being made of the fact that the film was made for just a few thousand dollars. Well, it doesn't look or sound cheap, and the actors are competent enough. But the key to a good movie is the script, and this one is unlikely to appeal to anyone but hardcore geeks. Indie filmmakers may want to study it, though.

Have you ever wondered while watching a Hollywood sci-fi, hi-tech thriller that if the film were actually as intelligent as it was pretending to be, it would actually present science that was coherent and interesting. Well, the actual result is almost as bad, but not entirely because of the writing.  The film fails because: 1) Non professional actors were used and the performances are pretty lifeless and 2)The writer/director hadn't really grasped the notion of dramatic action and how to portray that beyond the page. As a result, the film fails to draw the audience into its predicament.  Towards the end thing started to get somewhat interesting in terms of actual plot development, but to no avail.  It's as if the director sought to create a factual film while not caring about how he felt about the facts.  Films are a very emotional and sensoral medium which is why going to see them in a theatre is such a privelige, but seeing this one in a theatre would be just as entertaining as seeing it at home. While I applaud the effort of the team that made this film, I believe they failed in a large way and succeeded in a very small one.

2221113,4,B0007N1JC8,"The first time I watched it, the plot line was so complex, it was difficult to formulate a coherent opinion. I watched it second time with a fair minded friend, and it was a lot easier to understand after a lengthy discussion.

On the other hand, if you like brain teasers, puzzles, and likes to solve little nuances of a movie, this is exactly what you're looking for.

The plot line is simple: two engineers try to make a levitating machine (they call it ""diamagnetic"")in their garage, and actually succeed in doing it. The machine however has a special side-effect; any object that enters the machine can travel back in time. This is far different than a ""time machine"" because it only works one way, travel back in time, not forward. Carruth provides a very elegant and yet simple explanation of how the machine is able to achieve such a feat, but I won't go into that. The two engineers initially use this machine to make money off of the stock-market. But, as all time travel story goes, the frailties of humanity comes into the play that changes the lives of the two engineers. I won't give away the plot line, but it is definitely worth watching multiple times to fully understand the complex question that the film is proposing, such as cause and effect and time travel paradox.",1125187200,6,1415,4.592885375494071
2221114,1,B0007N1JC8,"I love Memento and time travel flicks in general...

I saw Ebert review this and thought it looked really neat.  So the story begins, with 4 science geeks babbling incoherent tech-speak.  Okay, no problem I thought, it's just like on ER when they ask for 300 CC's of hippopotacextradrine because a patient's inflabial corpusal is collapsing.

So I just tuned that out and waited for it to pass, and for the ""this is what all of that stuff earlier meant"" phase of the film.  But that moment never came.

They build a box, box sends things back in time, they build big boxes to send themselves back in time...that's the plot...

Then for some reason, there are doubles of themselves walking around and they have to hide from them in a hotel room for 6 hours every day.  This is NEVER EXPLAINED!!!

Then some other characters conveniently walk in and mumble something about a party and a guy with a shotgun...

That's the other thing about the movie...what isn't technical speak mumbo jumbo, is too mumbled and muffled to hear anyway!

So later in the film they're at a party trying to stop a murder or something I guess...I had completely forgotten about the party/shotgun comment from earlier.  Were they planning this out in the meantime?  I have no idea...either we were supposed to assume it or it was all muffled, who knows...

And then there was a drunk that jumped in their machine or something...

And they wear earpieces telling them recordings of what happened from their doppelganger doubles...or something...

And they repeat word-for-word these conversations...I guess...

And then one of them moves to France...or something...

I'm assuming there was a twist where they find out they are the doppelganger doubles...I honestly have no idea because it is never spelled out, never explained, and if it was explained, then the audio was so horrible that I couldn't make it out...

2221118,4,B0007N1JC8,"It is difficult to appreciate a book or movie if you can't identify with one of the characters. Primer has two main characters who, despite some minor differences, are pretty much the same. If you can't relate to this character, you don't stand a very good chance of enjoying the film.

Personally, I enjoyed this film without any handicaps allowed for budget. It wasn't, ""this is a good film for $7,000."" It was, ""this is a very good film."" If you don't have the budget, the script and the acting need to carry the film. I don't personally agree the acting was wooden, I thought the dialog and delivery was very realistic. It is one thing to have a cracking script, but writing a good script to be realized around the resources you have available is astonishing.

I watched Primer three times. It isn't long - only about 80 minutes. Each time I watched it, new details emerged. I did not catch everything the first time through and that is ok, although sometimes it was a problem with the mechanics of putting together a film. For example, when Abe and Aaron lift off the box cover after a problem occurred, the director cut to black and then cut to Abe lying on the floor. I thought something happened to Abe, which confused me for a while. This would have easily been rectified by a fade out to black at that point instead of a hard cut. I'm guessing there was not enough footage available for a proper fade.

After the weekend, I'm still thinking about the film and I love it when that happens. I don't have any bias towards Hollywood films, I like a good popcorn cruncher with explosions as much as the next guy, but sometimes I feel the weight of the budget and the decision-making committee that goes along with it. You end up with entertaining films that don't really take too many chances. This is a really good antidote for that. If I'm watching something that is the product of a singular vision, I'm out of the safety box of focus groups and test screenings and that means that anything is possible. I love that.

I hope Shane Carruth gets an opportunity to continue his film career. I wish him a bright future.

However, it should keep most people interested throughout the film.  The writer came up with a really novel story line, and then did a good job creating the film for a low budget.  There is good character development between the two leads.  The independent nature of the film tells you that this will not be a typical Hollywood ending, which means you have no idea where this film's going.  It's definitely a film for thinkers.

The drawback to the film is that a lot happens at the end and due to the complex concept of the film the plot becomes very difficult to follow.  I think that about 90% of viewers will experience some frustration over trying to determine what actually happened.  This is why I only gave the film 4 stars instead of 5.

Primer is an innovative approach to science fiction in film that sci/fi has been missing.  Instead of spending tons of money on special effects, the effects are cerebral.  When this film offers up the inexplicable or the amazing, the explanations are suggested at and tantalizingly held just beyond our grasp.  This results in a very creepy feeling permeating the work.  The viewer is also left to figure complicated plot turns on their own, instead of being 'hit over the head' with explanations.

Shane Carruth would appear to you as a veteran film-maker based upon this work; the fact that it is his first film is almost unbelievable.

I stayed up all night the evening I saw this movie for the first time.  Fortunately, I first saw it on DVD, so I was able to play it back several times to figure out what happened in the movie.

Most of the movie didn't bother with the event at all, it was just mentioned in passing.  Suddenly we're at the end of the movie and they've been going back over and over again to mess with this one event without our knowledge.  This is the climax of the movie.  There was no rising action, no concentration on this... just suddenly, ""Oh hey this is what we were doing this whole time.""  It's like the first 2/3rds of the movie didn't matter.

(Think: THX-1138, I Heart Huckabees, The Matrix, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Pi, A Boy And His Dog, etc.)

If you just want to sit and veg infront of a motion picture, you like ""feel good movies"", or like big noises, special effects, high drama & action for drama & action's sake (not that there's anything wrong with this at all - think: Hitch, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Out of Africa, or Star Trek - The Movie), then this movie will likely leave you wanting.  It is, relatively speaking, a geek movie.  And not in the sense of ""Real Genius"".

You can read as much as you like about the plot, etc. in other reviews.  I choose not to give away too much about specifics in my reviews.

The part that I really liked about this movie is its exploration into what happens in the human character and their relationships when they stumble onto a resource that provides great benefit and huge circumstance, and yet don't really fully understand or prepare themselves for how/why it works or the implications it brings with it.  The juxtaposition of being in a situation that is unfolding with unprecidented information allowing one to predictably alter said situation's outcome - and then dealing with the newly generated results, that one could not so easily predict - heady stuff.  Add to that some plausible sounding science (fiction) and recursive situational examination, and you have a formula for a great story that requires you to focus.

And THAT'S what this movie requires - your undivided focused attention.  Be ready to THINK, solve, and be mentally challenged.  I think that is why this movie won awards - it's challenging subject matter that revolves around complex situations, both technically and psychologically.  The questions it raises can be haunting indeed.

The fact that it is an incredibly low budget film is both astounding and supplies a vehicle for confusion.  The actors are first timers (as is the writer/director/editor/janitor/camera operator... you get the idea.)  This means that there is no room for verbose explanation.  YOU have to stay alert and figure stuff out.  There is no ""high emotion"" drama occuring as these are not trained method actors.  And at the same time, personlly (having been a technoid for a long time), I think they do a very good job of depicting how intellectual, engineering types would approach/react/respond to the situations presented in the story.

If you are a techie, scientist, metaphysician, psychologist, etc. or a fan of any of these, then you will probably dig this somewhat unsettling romp.

If not - if you don't like engineering/techno-babble stuff or movies that require you to THINK/SOLVE, don't bother wasting your $ or time.  Wait for it to hit network TV when it's free and there's no guilt in hitting the Channel +/- button.

Lastly, I have to say that it is a very clean-cut movie.  There's really no violence, no sexual themes, and little to no profanity (it got a PG-13 rating because the word 'fags' was spoken once).  I really appreciate that as well.

I give it 4 stars because I like intellectual teasers that pose introspective questions.

2221136,2,B0007N1JC8,"The actors in Primer seem inexperienced and unable to play much emotion. But that's not the problem with this movie.

The script is dense, and about 2/3 of the way through the film, it becomes almost impossible to understand exactly what is happening, and why. But that's not the problem with this movie.

If I did watch the requisite number of times needed to figure out the puzzle of what is actually happening in this film, it would not matter, because I do not care about what happens to any of these bland, directionless people. That is the problem with Primer.

After finishing the film, I started to go through it again, this time listening to the director's commentary. As he described the rehearsals, how much of the sound had to be redubbed, how the film's only special effects shot was done on his home computer, I thought to myself, 'Even if he eventually does explain the plot to me, I really could care less!' So, I gave up, and saved mysefl the time.

I like films that one can watch over and over again, catching new details and enjoying newly-noticed nuance. My Dinner With Andre would be an example of such a film. This movie is not worth watching once, except as a demonstration of what is technically possible on a low budget, filming with Super 16mm film, and editing with a computer. The technique is only worthwhile if you have characters who are worth knowing, and the characters in Primer are hardly more dimensional than the paper the script was printed on.

I found myself going backward two or three scenes at a time to get a better understanding of what happened in another scene, since it's so easy to miss important bits.

There are subtleties that are easily missed on the first viewing, which become much more clear the second time around.  I found this movie fun and intriguing at first, but it disintegrated into a confusing mess at the end.  It's a story of time manipulation, paradoxes, and scientific discovery.  Too bad they leave so much out that it leaves your head spinning.  The director's style seems to be ""show a little, explain less, and let the viewers figure it all out in their heads"".

What Aaron and Abe create in the movie is fascinating because it is capable of doing the impossible. The very same principle is what makes Primer such a remarkable piece of work.

Making a truly thought-provoking film with a budget of $7,000 and a running time of 78 minutes just does not happen in Hollywood.

And while Primer is ultimately a small step rather than a giant leap for independent filmmaking, it is encouraging to see even the most obscure of ideas find a home (or at least a garage) on the silver screen.

It did however look promising so the next day I rented it and gave it another whirl. All I can say is, Wow!

Even if you don't understand the technobabel that takes place in the begining then you can still enjoy the rest of the movie. Shane Carruth uses this to establish that these guys are professionals and know whats going on. The two main characters, Abe and Aaron, work on a project by themselves that end up having time travel capabilities. Once this power is introduced, their conventional friendship is corrupted by greed and ego.

The movie does get a bit confusing with multiple time machines and versions of the characters. But if you let yourself get lost in this then you won't realize the true theme of the movie that power can corrupt anyone and change them.

If the movie is too much for you, there are several resources on the net to help you unravel the plot. It is well worth the work.

This is why it got me excited into watching it in the first place (being a sci-fi fan). Even the trailer looked exciting.

However, after being glued to the screen for half the movie, trying to follow the geeky dialog and weird plot, this movie nose-dives into the ground, crashes and burns, leaving no trace of the good concept it originated from.

Supposedly the director tried to be ""very realistic"" when it came to time travel, and succeeded in creating a film with no heads or tails for cults to follow and drop their jaws at for generations to come.

I for once, decide to watch a movie (may it be a thriller, Sci-Fi, comedy, etc) to get away from all the mumbo-jumbo the world throws at you and just sit back, relax and enjoy something interesting, thought provoking or just a nice story telling.

However I got none of that from this movie.

Some other folks say ""You must watch it hundreds of times to understand it!"" Sorry. I am neither that geeky nor have that much time to waste.

To me it just shows that anyone can make a crappy movie in their garage with their 200 dollar camera and their 4 buddies and that there will always be cult followers who will love this.

It's certainly the worst, least entertaining movie I have watched this year. The 1 minute trailer was far superior than the 78 minute movie.

2221153,3,B0007N1JC8,"Aaron and Abe are two brainiac engineers trying to come up with a new concept that'll help them get published and, hopefully, make them some money. But nothing seems to be working in their favor ...until ...they accidentally stumble upon something of a time machine while working in Abe's garage. At first it just seems to be a machine that can decrease the size and weight of an object, something that could save companies like NASA billions of dollars in payload lifting. But they soon find that the machine ISN'T decreasing weight and size, it's moving the item back in time.

Initially Abe and Aaron use their newfound discovery to help them make money (they travel back one day in time to find out what the stock market was doing and put their money into stocks that blossom the next day). But the risks are greater than they could've imagined. You've got to stay away from anyplace that your double might be, and you can't interact with anyone on your trip back or you could screw up the time-line. What they don't know, couldn't know really, is that they've gone into a time loop (something that repeats itself over and over and over again), but the loop changes because of what each of them knows about the future and what they can get out of it.

***********************************************************************************

If this sounds confusing, it is. The concept is beyond the grasp of normal individuals (with the exception being time theorists and engineers), so that's partly why I only gave it three stars.

The incredible thing about the film that made it watchable is that the concept, although REALLY out there, was fresh. There was no time machine, per se, but a little box that resembled a coffin in which you stuck yourself into while your doppleganger wandered around and did your bidding. Again, don't get your brain into a twist over this; it's complicated science.

The filming was pretty amazing, too. Done on a shoestring budget of just $7,000, it looks and feels like a professionally shot movie. There's no wobbly camera movements, no out of focus shots, etc. There were a few times when the sound was less than optimal, but it wasn't anything that bothered me too much.

The parts of the film that bothered me most were the dialogue and the out-of-reach message that most movie viewers will never, ever get. The dialogue was both beyond me (I'm not an engineer or a time theorist) and difficult to hear due to overlapping conversations. Now I know that this might be how real engineers talk, but does that translate into good dialogue on film? I think not. The message of the film is in there, but it's buried so deeply in the engineer double-speak and concept of the movie that most viewers will never be able to find it.

This isn't the type of film you can watch once and think you have a grasp of what it's all about. Trust me, it'll take at least three viewings.

What surprises me most is that this film won the Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004. A science fiction movie? Winning an independent film award? Will the wonders never cease?",1118966400,41,3099,4.715341959334566

This movie is like an onion, the more layers you peal the closer you get to the core. The more times you watch it the more you will say, oh, so that's why, so and so. The more the two try and fix the mess they created the more of a mess they make and then attempt to stop themselves from doing what they did in the first place. So sit back watch the film, think about it for a few minutes, take a long walk and go back and watch it again, three times if you have to, it will come to you sooner or later. It is almost like staring at those weird 3D posters (big in the 90's, I think an Al Gore invention), that required you to look at them without really looking and before you knew it, ""bam!""

2221155,2,B0007N1JC8,"The positives.  It's got a lot of low tech engineero-babble in it that actually sounds pretty good (I am one of their kind, and can speak their language).  With the exception of the weeble-coating slime-mold clue, it comes across as ""believable"". Very original and ballsey for a first time indy project, so a lot of credit is due, BUT, this movie fails in the fundamentals.

Doesn't a movie owe it to a viewer to at least be understandable on some level during the first viewing? Isn't that a fundamental part of the movie art form, a reasonable expectation of a viewer? I don't mind a good head-fake ending, like Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects, or Fight Club. Even a thick plot like Heat, or Memento may take multiple viewings to fully appreciate all the connections, but all of those projects provide a payoff for the first time viewer.

Primer on the otherhand is just an excercize in manipulation. Too clever by half. Being intentionally indecipherable, it is inaccessable, and therefore not really art, and not really much of a movie. The techno babble, the lack of any warmth or arc or discernable motivations, the extraordinarally poor audio, all of it knee-caps this thing before it even starts to move.  The entire viewing experience is a let down.  I've seen it twice, but haven't gotten much in the way of genuine enjoyment out of it. And I also have to throw the flag on the Sundance award given to this movie.  I think it has to be an ""Emperor Has no Clothes"" type situation; a group of people who after a single viewing simply could not admit to each other that they couldn't understand an opaque storyline that ""appeared"" intellectually demanding.

Mabye Primer makes sense after multiple viewings.  Maybe.  I just know that it doesn't after two.  So, if you are looking to turn a 90 minute indy movie into a hobby requiring dozens of hours of time-line flow-charting that may or may not reveal anything, then this may be a great subject.  Unfortunately that's exactly what makes it a poor movie.

If you decide to watch it, turn your ""machine"" on before you start, you'll want to be able to get back out and stop yourself.",1118793600,11,2135,4.661333333333333

Each of the characters seems to know the other so well, that they break in to answer before the other finishes.  It is obvious that they know what was going to be said but the rest of us are left in the dark.

I understood about the time machine and all but shortly after their first manipulation of the stock market it just totally lost me.  I read here that there is suppose to be a third party who knows about the machine but I never did figure out who that was or that there even was a third party.  You could never figure out what each of the 2 main characters was trying to do.

There was something about a party with a guy and a shotgun but what about it??  It was mentioned earlier by the other 2 engineers that shared the garage with the main characters but they never even said what happened with the guy with the shotgun, so it was never clear why trying to do something about it was necessary.

I've watched plenty of confusing movies but this one takes the cake for total disregard of the audience.  People don't mind convoluted plot twist and turns but you've got to tie it up eventually for the audience and this film failed miserably to do that.

I'll watch it again but if this is the confused sort of thing that Sundance thinks is so good, I'd avoid anything like the plague that they put their stamp of approval on.  I gave it 2 stars because of the premise and the fact that you could believe that a previously unknown phenomena could be stumbled upon and made to work with a rather simple device.

2221158,3,B0007N1JC8,"""Primer"" is a very cool and somewhat creepy time travel film. In short, it's about two guys, Abe and Aaron, who (accidentally) build a device that allows them to travel back in time. They do the standard things a novice time traveler would to--play around with the stock market, test out some minor paradoxes, re-shape certain events in their favor, etc. Eventually, they discover that a third party knows about their device, and chaos ensues (sorry--I don't want to give away too much at this point).

The plot is extremely complex. Not only are there multiple timelines to consider, but there's a power play going on between Abe and Aaron in that whoever uses the device the most and whoever sets it earliest will have an advantage over the other in that they will have more knowledge of future events.

The film is also fairly realistic in that it doesn't rely on special effects and that it mixes just enough science fact in with the fiction in order to make it plausible. Plus, it's well-acted--you get the sense that this is how events would unfold if a time machine were really invented in someone's garage.

The reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the plot is a little *too* complex for such a short movie (only 76 minutes). Too much goes on behind the scenes, and the viewer is left to figure out too much for themselves. If it's too confusing, there are numerous timelines posted on the Internet that help put things in perspective.

It took quite a while until the premise was even set up-that the two lead characters had inadvertantly created a device that sends things back in time. I was only able to figure this out from their scheme to manipulate stocks or mutual funds to their advantage. That's also about the last thing in the film I could understand. The two talk about the time travel process creating doubles, but this didn't seem readily apparent to me nor was it explained. The film's plot doesn't work and aside from the plot it offers nothing else of merit. The actors are amateurs, the dialogue sounds like what might happen if William Burroughs' cut-up technique was applied to a technical manual and the film is visually uninteresting.

Every few years someone comes along with a film supposedly made on a shoestring budget and their triumph of entrepreneurship wows people. That seems to really be the story that people want to hear.

The more you watch and pay attention to it, the more you'll feel like you've got pop rocks on the brain.  It's exhilerating from a documentary-like objective standpoint and intellectual exploration.  But the acting is also very good with nice pacing within the scenes.  The ending at first seems a bit rushed, yet on further viewings I think it works.  It parallels the rapid spinning out of control that has occured with breaking causal symmetry.  And the last line of the film, a voice over, is pitch perfect.  That's film making.  Great beginnings and great endings with a proper development, connections, and set up between the two.  It's amazing this was done on such a budget.  Sure, it looks like 16mm that wasn't transfered correctly all the time, but it often works better than if it had a bigger budget.  I am eager to see what this writer/director does in the future.

Still, I'm a sucker for festival award winners, so I rented ""Primer,"" which won the Grand Jury Award at Sundance.  In addition, I heard this was made for $7000, on par with the classic ""El Mariachi,"" so that caught my interest.

I was surprised to find that ""Primer"" looked so much like a movie - something very difficult to do for so little money, especially when shooting on film.  The composition, the camera motion, and the lighting were on par with much more expensive movies.  Lighting can be one of the toughest things for a new filmmaker to master, but in virtually every shot the lighting works.  The camera work was excellent, and by and large the actors were surprisingly good.

The biggest problem with ""Primer"" is the fact that it has a lot of story to cram into a short running time, and that story is pretty confusing at best.  It's difficult to tell a time-travel story where multiple incarnations of the same person are in that story; there needs to be some way to tell them apart.  Some visual shorthand, some dialogue cues, something.  Yet, toward the end of this film, some events happen that are tremendously confusing, and we get no help from the movie or the commentary in figuring them out.  As a result, the ending loses some of the impact I think it was meant to have.  To me, this was the greatest failing of ""Primer,"" and why it gets 4 and not 5 stars.  Adding to the confusion factor is the fact that the actors intentionally talk over each other a lot in the first part of the movie, so that the audience doesn't get some pieces of what's happening.

Still, this movie is quite an accomplishment, especially for the money.  And while it can be confusing, it never fails to engage your interest.  ""Primer"" is at least worth a rent.",1117670400,,1857,4.498507462686567

Genre Grade: C+

Final Grade: A

This is probably the smartest and most innovative film I've seen since Memento. While it is extremely difficult to grasp the content of the story and figure out just what the hell is going on, it still proves itself as a great movie. Luckily I have always had an interest in time travel theories and so I somewhat understood some of the things they were talking about and the parts that did confuse me were not enough to take me away from realizing what the two main characters stumbled upon.

This is a very slow-paced film and you will find yourself stretching your mind to understand exactly what is going on, but as you watch this film unfold, I assure you that you will realize the genius of it. This film asks the question: ""What would you do if you could change the future by traveling back in time?"" And as a viewer, you will find yourself being tempted of the notion of it all. You could easily make millions, gain power, and everything else that is part of the worst of human desires.

This movie does more than answers that question. It shows you the consequences. And it offers a strong morality lesson on human nature. Don't miss this one - even if you expect to be completely confused (although I do not recommend this film for audiences who only enjoy mainstream films - thus its Genre Grade of C+).",1116979200,4,1378,4.47410358565737

Still, what this filmmaker managed to do on a miniscule budget is amazing. It IS a good story, and original story. And the commentary was for me as interesting as the movie itself.  Carruth not only wrote, produced, directed, and acted in the film, he did the over-dubbing and special effects--effects done with a camcorder and his home pc.  Weebles figure significantly in the movie--these he picked up on E-bay. Photographs used in the movie were Photoshopped and sent to an online developer for printing.

2221188,4,B0007N1JC8,"A strange, creative little film, this.  One that manages to make visual the chaos of quantum physics in the form of human permutations of the disorder and bizarre combination of marvel and fear that confront the mind upon a moment of discovery of a new fact/concept. This is a film that should be viewed by an  audience prepared to engage those parts of the brain not usually readily accessible, but available cellules of new thought chambers that need and should be challenged if we are to continue to cope with a universe increasingly less understandable the more we study it.

Beginning with the title, PRIMER, no insight is presented as to whether the meaning is 1) introductory text: a book that provides an introduction to a topic, or 2) as in  biochemistry: genetic material - a molecular substrate such as a DNA molecule needed in the polymerization reaction that produces another molecule structurally similar to the substrate.  That is the beginning hurdle.  But if the viewer stumbles on the easy bumps, then the remainder of the story will be impossible.  Instead it is recommended that this film be approached with a 'tabula rasa' and simply watch as four young men bent on inventing the next big 'thing' fall into discovery of what appears to be a device that involves time travel, both horizontal and vertical.  The characters (Shane Carruth, David Sullivan, Casey Gooden, and Anand Upadhyaya) resemble talking heads and it is the dissolution of this quartet into a duet that supplies the human-interest aspect of this science experiment.  First, discovery, then analytical permutations, and ultimately greed and the accompanying human foibles that are sparked by the new.

This is very obviously a low budget work of love by writer/director/actor/cinematographer/producer/musical scorer/editor Shane Carruth (yes, he does it all) with all of the other tasks being accomplished by the remaining members of the cast.  The idea of the film is good and the fellows pull it off well.  If the dialogue becomes annoyingly verbose and abstract and covered by a rather pompous voice-over commentator, just rest assured that much of it isn't decipherable because of the quality of the sound and the fact that everyone talks simultaneously.  And if at the end of the film you are left scratching your head as to what you have just seen, then try to quickly summarize quantum physics or the chaos theory or even something as simple as molecular biology!  It is not meant to be simple, it is meant to approximate the terror and joy of confrontation with the frontiers of science and examine how inventions dealing with the chaos theory are inexorably linked with human frailties.  At a budget of $7,000.  this film relies more of personal commitment on the part of the crew than on the need to create a blockbuster movie.  Exercise your mind - try it.

2221189,5,B0007N1JC8,"Hi,

I watched this DVD that I bought, it's an original, from Ebay. I really liked the movie, but about a fourth of they way into it, the DVD freezes, locks and stops. Anyone else had any trouble like this? I checked the DVD and it is clean, save for a little bump in the foil layer below the top disc layer.

Thanks!",1115424000,3,317,4.015873015873016
2221190,5,B0007N1JC8,"The question I'd ask viewers who've watched Primer is ""How far in did you make it before clarity began to break down?"" Perhaps this is what motivates so many to go back for repeated viewings, hoping to break their own comprehension threshold. So where am I at with ""Primer?"" I've watched it twice and I keep thinking of Jeffrey Goldblum's character, the ""Chaotician,"" in the Jurassic Park movies. A guy like that would have a field day with ""Primer,"" and I'm even willing to bet that Carruth may have had a thought or two about Jurassic Park, among other sources, while putting Primer together. Here's a key: really, isn't ""Primer"" about the introduction of entropy - chaos - into the time travel narrative? Or, put another way, just because you set up some rules doesn't mean your doppleganger will follow them. All confusion aside, Carruth has found a novel format to pose an age-old question: How well do we really know ourselves?",1115337600,5,933,4.765432098765432
2221211,5,B0007N1JC8,"This is one of the most remarkable pieces of cinema I've seen in years.  ""Primer"" is definitely not for all audiences, and, truth be told, it's pretty slow going stuff for a good portion of the film.  Nonetheless, my interest never flagged, but was rather piqued and curious more than being merely entertained.

Extremely difficult to fully understand, I watched, at times uncertain of what I was hearing and pretty sure that all of this was over my head.  Slowly though, one realizes there are several points in ""Primer"" where things begin to click and make sense.  There was, for me, one particular point which can only be described as a truly ""Aha!"" moment . . . as my jaw hit the floor!

""Primer"" is loaded with paradoxes and writer/director and star Shane Carruth clearly acknowledges these, yet even within these limitations - like time travel itself - we watch them expand and contract into permutations that, once understood, are horrifyingly unsettling.

This is a movie to watch repeatedly and I can see cults devoted to ""Primer.""  The movie was apparently made for almost nothing and its sets, costumes reflect that - beautifully:  Primer doesn't need them.  A suburban living room, garage, U-Haul storage bin, a borrowed lab, a parking lot and a motel room pretty much constitute every set for the film, yet by its end you'll feel as though having re-discovered the universe.

It takes an ax to antiquated beliefs about the concept of time and our place in it, particularly the concept of time ""paradoxes"" in favor of a more quantum-theory friendly, new-school take on time travel.  A refreshingly new tale revolving around two greedy young entrepreneurs with a dangerous new invention, brimming with potential.  Their caution with the device has driven a few moviegoers mad, however I felt it added to the realism of the film in favor of huge, massively disbelief-suspending blockbusters.  Original, powerful, chilling cryptic and refreshing.

The audio isn't pristine, the video isn't always in perfect focus, the story doesn't have a full explanation for it's conclusion.

I would like to focus on what this movie is:  Brilliant.  Being a free lance videographer I know the difficulties of producing something when you're giving two apples and a piece of lent as a budget.  You have to be quite a few things.  You have to be creative with a story, you have to learn to work with what you have, and you must be able to take a stereotyped culture and make them forget that you're doing both of the previous things.

People the actors are also the writers are also the camera men.  It was done for under 10,000 dollars.  Considering most movies run at a price of 10,000 dollars PER SECOND the feat is even more admirable.  I commend these people for showing the rest of us what you can do with using unique camera angles, a solid script, and a few tricks the old fashion way.  For anyone intrested in the indie route this film is a virtual guide to success.  I'll never say it's flawless but it's definately an unbelievable success story.

2221215,5,B0007N1JC8,"Primer is a metaphor for the value of a great premise over the buck.  The film was made on a shoestring . . . for far less than Closer or The Day After Tomorrow(sorry I couldn't resist the left hook to Hollywood's schlock conveyor belt).

Part of its appeal is the film does not show(or tell) what exactly is happening.  The story draws us in as we guess what is happening-and when!  But, how could the film explain how time travel works?  The time travelers themselves cannot fully explain what they discovered.  Their staccato dialogue about mathematics and physics serves the film well.  Myth, bubbling under the surface, involves quantum mechanics; an object's position in time and space can only be assigned a probability . . . not a certainty.

The excitement is not the wild ride of time travel and its effect on the world, but how a discovery rips apart a deep friendship.

2221216,4,B0007N1JC8,"My husband is a HUGE fan of time travel movies, and when he heard about a film called Primer winning the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, he wanted me to keep an eye out for it to add to our online rental queue.

There's a whole lot of talking in the first 15 minutes or so. It's kind of aggravating because you can't hear what they're saying because they're speaking over each other. (Found out later when listening to the director commentary that it was rehearsed many, many times...to give a feel of improvisation).

I had a feeling that if we hung in there, we'd be rewarded. Some movies...you just get that feeling.

Yes, the plot is convoluted. The director wanted to stay true to ""real science"", so the back-and-forth talking was, well, real science. I just wished that it was mentioned early on just *what* they were building in the garage! (You find out through the director commentary that they were building a superconductor. Don't remember even hearing that in the movie.) Rather, there's a lot of techno-speak about freon, freezing points, and so on.

I have to say that I knew nothing about this film when watching it. I was struck by some of the unusual camera angles...I felt like I was watching art. The acting was incredibly believable, and the sound ""effects"" were organic and analog. Found out through the commentary that this was the director's precise intent. You don't get the feeling that you're watching a slick Hollywood production; instead, you feel like you're literally a part of these guys' pet projects.

As time goes on, tension builds and a sense of foreboding enters the picture. There were quite a few scenes where I gripped my husband's hand and my stomach was in knots. I said to him ""Man, this is like a horror film!"" I don't like slashers, or even horror films, but my idea of ""horror"" was the implications of what those guys were doing in the garage...and then, later, in the U-Haul storage center.

Surprisingly, the director and writer was also the main star. He's a *wonderful* actor that looks a bit like Keanu Reeves. The guy playing Abe was just as good. And the shots...to *think* that this guy filmed in his proverbial backyard is amazing. There's some really great shots in this film. And you know what? I didn't even notice the music until the second play-through with the director's commentary. To me, that's good music editing...when you don't even know it's there. (And yeah, the director did the music, too...on his computer!)

The movie's ending is confusing, and I still am not sure about some of the elements. When you're dealing with time-travel scenarios and messing with the future, you'll have that, I guess.

If you're the type of person that wants/needs everything spelled out for you, you may not like this film. If you need ""the point"" on a proverbial billboard, or want mile-a-minute MTV-like action, you may not like this film. But if you're fascinated by the idea of time travel and other scientific ""what ifs?"", you'll likely enjoy this cerebral movie. If you enjoy subtlety as is seen in movies such as Office Space, Pieces of April, Napoleon Dynamite, etc.-- as well as flicks that are compellingly character-driven--you'll likely love this movie. Those who appreciate the art of filmmaking will no doubt enjoy this movie as well...especially after you hear the director's commentary (and what went into making this film.) And contrary to what another reviewer said, not ALL shots were done in one take. This movie wasn't done slipshod and then sent off to Sundance. A lot of care went into this movie...with Shane and his co-star rehearsing one scene (a dialogue) for two months.

I'm excited to see more from this filmmaker, writer, and actor. He is truly a talented guy...as is his main co-star and the other actors (one of which is also the cameraman).

Note: the DVD said it was R rated for brief language, but I can't remember one curse word being uttered! Go figure.",1114300800,13,3941,4.756954612005856
2221217,5,B0007N1JC8,"The ""whole package"" is what this movie is about. It would seem that the intangibles combined with the intentional-create a synergy that captivates the mind!

""The permutations are endless"" well sums up the movie. What would you do...if you could have perfect hindsight and foresight-how long would your altruism and your noble idealism last?

It's so dimensional you will watch it over and over. I read where some feel they have it figured out, but the sage advice comes from a fan that says ""stop reading and keep watching!""

The low-budget while evident at times, actually adds to the mystique. I found myself annoyed by the slightly muffled and sometimes garbled soundtrack-which incidentally improved towards the middle (probably as Shane developed his prowess with audio and the actors begin to project a bit more). The graininess of the film shows through at times, but once again- it sets the mood and actually looks very intentional. Yet, that very tension actually sets you up for the true impact-when you realize the ""permutations are endless.""

""Primer"" is one of those very rare movies that comes along to give Hollywood a real kick in the pants-to say ""THIS is how you create a thriller""-it's in the heart, not in the budget. It's amazing what $7k and a man with a vision can do!

2221219,5,B0007N1JC8,"There exists a very small genre of movies...12 Monkeys, Memento, The Thing, Basic, Donnie Darko....that DEMAND repeated viewings.  These are movies that with one viewing, you have not enjoyed or understood the majority of the material.  Watching one of these movies is like uncovering a gold mine....you find that there is a wealth, a journey of information and thoughts that you have been invited to and have only just begun.

Primer is one of these movies.  I have only seen it once, which nearly makes me unqualified to review it.  I cannot say how well it all fits together yet.  I will say that it makes Memento seem simple at times and promises to keep me thinking for months if not years.

Here's the real kicker: 1) Primer was made on a budget of $7000!  2) Every scene was filmed in one take!  3) All of the actors are complete unknown amateurs!

You would never guess that any of these three facts are true.  The acting is seamless, the cinematography is often noticeably (in an attention grabbing way) good, and while there aren't any special effects, nothing suggests that this is a low budget film.

Like most of the movies I listed at the top, Primer is a movie best viewed without knowing ANYTHING about it.  It has a playful tone of discovery that will be blunted if you have too much knowledge of the plot.

Some people have complained that the movie is largely emotionless.  For most of the movie, this is true.  However, the puzzle it creates is engrossing enough that I, for one, felt no lack of emotion.  In fact, the absence of swelling emotions made the film feel much more realistic at times, and I think that may have been the intent.

If you like any of the films I mentioned above, don't miss this one.  This isn't the type of movie that mainstream audiences like, so it will never get the recognition it deserves.

2221261,4,B0007N1JC8,"There's a moment in ""Back to the Future II"" when the story becomes so complicated that old Doc Brown actually has to sit Marty McFly down and use a blackboard to explain the plot to him.

Halfway through the super low-budget time travel thriller, ""Primer,"" I realized I needed Doc Brown's help myself. But I also realized he'd need a big damn blackboard, and possibly a PowerPoint presentation, to straighten me out.

It's about a group of young Texas engineers who build a device in their garage that, they soon learn, allows them to travel back in time for brief periods. It's a space-time loophole they exploit for stock tips and basketball scores but the movie takes a darker turn when the characters realize they actually exist in the past and their future selves have managed to screw things up big time.

Writer-director-producer-star Shane Carruth keeps the special effects to a bare, effective minimum and hurls all kinds of technical mumbo-jumbo at the viewer in order to suspend disbelief, and he actually goes well out of his way to confuse the audience.

The trick to enjoying ""Primer,"" however is to just sit back, allow yourself to be confused for a while and let the plot unfold.  This is a puzzle-movie, as coldly clinical as a Kubrick film and as challenging as ""Memento"" but with a more satisfying pay-off and with more questions answered on repeat viewings.",1113955200,7,1377,4.817796610169491

2221264,3,B0007N1JC8,"Winner of the 2004 Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize, PRIMER (New Line) is a minimalist, ultra low-budget (under $10,000) art film about time travel.

First-time filmmaker, Shane Carruth wrote, directed and stars in this 16mm film that quickly takes a garage experiment into the arena of ethics, philosophy and the paradoxes of quantum physics always testing the basic bonds of friendship between the four partners (and spouses).

Puzzling, exasperating, yet highly engaging, I was intellectually stimulated by the surprisingly complicated problems when two of the partners conduct personal, secret, experiments.

This obtuse, left brain story defies a simple, linear, rational summary.  Cool and almost always emotionless, the static compositions and dialogue heavy, longish master scenes are in keeping with the subject matter that is rooted in the apparent conundrums of real physics.

If you're a techno-geek engineer type, or if you liked ""Memento"" and ""Pi,"" you'll better appreciate this puzzler that demands multiple viewings to even begin to crack the ""Primer"" code. And don't miss the commentary by writer/director Carruth if you want to better understand the obtuse story and its production.",1112918400,9,1209,5.584699453551913

Don't get me wrong, I left the theatre as dazed and confused as most people did.  But, it was somewhere along the lines of complete awe.

This film is probably one of the best films I've seen dealing with time travel.  The grainy, washed out quality of the film gave it a realistic documentary style.  I didn't see the comparisons with Memento that most people refer to.  The feeling I got from the movie was closer to the intesity I felt when I watched The Insider.  I just felt tense and uneasy as the characters fiddled with their new ""toy"".  The soundtrack had a very good ambient touch that helped add emphasis to the seriousness of the film.

So, in short; if you like intellectual, intense, dramatic, sci-fi movies, then you'll like this film.  And, yes it may be a little to artsy for some.  If Timecop is your favorite movie then you probably won't like Primer (jab).",1111881600,86,1045,4.5

Topically, Primer is about a couple of guys who build a time machine. But the story is not just about engineers, it's told from and acted out through an engineer's perspective--the careful exploration and thoughtful design that the best engineers always exhibit with a new discovery. That is what separates it from every other story that has ever featured a time machine (as excellent as Back to the Future was), and that's the primary sense in which this is a perfect movie.

It's also a perfect movie in some other ways--the dark, grainy cinematography (evidence of the budget than of any preference for such shooting) grants the same ""this could really happen"" feeling as it does in ""Clerks."" The acting, too, done again by engineers, is an asset. The score is nerve-wracking piano keying, a great addition if a bit slow.

So here's the downside: I saw this movie once in NY on opening night with a friend who is, like I am, very oriented towards abstract thought. We both got most of what happened, and desired a second viewing to get the rest. But then I saw it with an MIT electrical engineering student in Cambridge, and she didn't get a bit of it. Straight over her head. So I give it five stars to anyone who is willing to do some abstract engineer thinking, but don't bother if you aren't.",1110844800,18,1496,4.492647058823529
2221267,4,B0007N1JC8,"Although much has been made of the film's dense science concepts and the technobabble that permeates the script, Primer is first and foremost an examination of ethics and morality: If you discovered a means to acquire extreme wealth, to what degree would you betray your notions of humanity to achieve that end?  Would you sacrifice friendships and business relationships?  Some would and do.  Would you betray your family?  Would you kill yourself a little piece at a time -- or even all at once -- to make a profit?  Could using the same power/technology to do a good deed redeem these profit motive transgressions?  Ultimately, this movie is a cautionary tale about the pitfalls that lie at the intersection of technology and ethics, which is a recurring theme in science fiction...

As for the comments about the confusing nature of the narrative, this is a movie about messing with the space-time continuum.

2221268,3,B0007N1JC8,"Engineer turned filmmaker Shane Carruth's debut film, ""Primer,"" examines the overwrought theme of time travel in an expressive, refreshing light.

Filmed with a budget of $7,000, which hardly covered the cost of its 16mm film stock and camera rental, ""Primer"" is by no means the next obtrusive sci-fi PG-13 Hollywood blockbuster.  Often compared to ""Memento"" and ""Pi,"" the film utilizes neither special effects nor flashy spectacle, yet creates an astounding world both scientifically complex yet personally grounded.

Writer/director/star Carruth's story revolves around four friends who, outside of their suit-and-tie jobs, spend hours of their free time in a garage working on an ambiguous science project.  There are moments of frustration and failure, but ultimately efforts result in a box-like machine that has various unmatchable capabilities; most intriguingly, it can ""degrade"" time.  Given the machine's potential, the men realize that they have created something too dangerous to market.  The question is then, how not let its technology go to waste.

Technically, as the story shifts to a focus on the two main characters, Aaron (Carruth) and Abe (up-and-coming actor David Sullivan), ""Primer"" turns to a path frighteningly close to the clich time travel story.  While exploiting the possibilities of time travel with newly built human-sized boxes, Abe and Aaron soon realize the inconceivable dangers they have brought upon themselves and those they love.  Haven't we seen this before?

However, the film's low budget and close knit cast and crew ultimately shine through brightly.  The Grand Jury Prize at Sundance is not awarded carelessly.  With an entire supporting cast consisting of friends and family of its unpaid stars, who also doubled as the crew, there is a sense of trust and unity emanated by the actors' performances and the film itself.  It becomes clear that the volatile relationship between Abe and Aaron is truly the centerpiece of the film's script.

Yet the film's greatest success sadly lies in its ability to confuse the viewer.  The time in which events take place, the characters involved, and the reasons for various actions become blurred.  And with a 78 minute running time, there is certainly a yearning for more.

While the scientific aspects of the film are neither sufficiently thorough nor simple, the core of the film lies in its emotion.  ""Primer,"" beautifully shot in an amateur yet sophisticated style, appeals to a mature audience able to delve into the profundity of the human spirit.  Underneath the stolid science and unavoidable confusion, there is a human sensitivity that we all can relate to.",1098576000,30,2652,5.301435406698564

2221270,3,B0007N1JC8,"Winner of two prestigious Sundance Film Festival awards, this short (78 minute) film contains enough subtle hints to make Memento a simple-to-follow piece of work.  That's a sarcastic jab, for those in the know.

This is very hard to follow and yes, does take several viewings to even begin to figure out what's going on, but as the reviewer for a highly reputable NY City newspaper said, even after several viewings the viewer may come away confused.

One of the problems, if I may say so, is that there is essentially no emotional resonance in the film.  This is purely a work of intellect.  The fact that I had read a lot about the film before I saw it helped to such an extent that if I had not read anything beforehand, I probably would not have been aware of what was going on.

Four engineers are looking for a way to make some serious cash.  They initially discuss what sounds like a software venture, but at the same time, two (Abe and Aaron) are tinkering around with a device in Aaron's garage.  These two are friends; another reviewer pointed out that this is a character-driven film, but one suspects that you have to be able to identify how engineers, and especially young engineers, relate to each other to sense their friendship.  There is no smiling, no laughter, no sense of camaraderie.

The ""friendship"" is based strictly on respect for each other's intellect.  Of course such friendships exist, but when what appears to be some pretty strange things start happening, the total lack of emotional response on the part of either one of these guys means that the audience has that much tougher a time to understand what is happening because there are no links--not even points of light--to identify when something odd is happening as opposed to something ordinary.

The thing that they are tinkering around with in the garage evolves into a machine/device/gizmo/whatever that allows them to see ahead in time.  In so doing, they generate temporary doubles of themselves.  When they refer to these doubles, it is so matter-of-fact that one would think not only that they knew in advance this would happen, but that this is just another typical event in the life of a bright engineer.

Key to understanding the tone of this dry work is a line spoken by an older engineer near the beginning of the film.  He says, ""What do they do with engineers when they reach the age of 40?""  The answer--""They take them out and shoot them.""  Abe and Aaron are both well below 40 and their tremendously intense stares, rapid fire speech, and markedly oblique language labels them as those who live in nothing but their own world.

Thus what is really needed to understand this film is the ability to identify with--to get inside the head of--someone with this kind of thinking.  That is, the viewer really has to be able to shift his/her style of perceiving/thinking/knowing to one that emphasizes rapid grasp of concepts including leaps of cognition that most of us do not make in our day-to-day lives.  The fact that the film won awards means, I think, that the awards committee was highly impressed with how comprehensively the filmmaker, Shane Carruth, was able to convey the completely intense mindset of engineers not even 30 years old, more than anything else.

As well as lacking in emotional resonance, this is not primarily a visual film either.  It is a film that emphasizes ideas over everything else, that focuses like a white-hot poker on the mind and how it jumps like a flea on methedrine trying to survive a hot plate--from concept to concept--with such speed and with so many sudden turns that to even try to delineate them all is essentially futile.

The real question is, is it worth it?  It's hard to say.  For those who enjoy puzzles, sure it is.  This is obviously not a Hollywood film; the filmmaker, in fact, has done everything he could to make an ANTI-Hollywood film and in that he has succeeded.  But it is a film with ferocious intelligence and if nothing else, should be lauded for that.

I am still uncertain of how to rate this, and so I have given it three stars.",1097625600,45,4096,4.673640167364017

Would've given it 3 stars but ending was highly disappointing.  Don't get sucked into this one unless its free & you really don't have anything better to do!",1524960000,,398,4.351351351351352
8049154,2,B0007N1JC8,"Bad camera, bad storyline, bad acting. This looks more like a school project movie than something you would pay to see.

It is also the only movie out of more than 1000 movies I have watched that I'm confused what's going on until the last minute. To add some credentials, I have watched 190 movies out of top 250 IMDB movies.

I'll stick with big budget Hollywood movies from now on.

Do yourself a favor and don't waste your hard earned money on this.",1524787200,,453,4.369047619047619
8049155,2,B0007N1JC8,"While, yes, I know that this super-low-budget independent science-fantasy has acquired something of a cult following over the years, the movie's extended technobabble and philosophical conundrums are highly overrated.

In a nutshell, a couple of engineers, tinkering in the garage with an antigravity experiment, make an astounding technological discovery: A time-loop capable of allowing them to travel a few hours into the past and affect changes to the linear timeline.  Seeing an opportunity for tremendous profit, they exploit the discovery to engage in a little day-trading in the stock market.

They realize too late that their project has far-reaching consequences, creating multiple divergent timelines and multiple anomalies that they must attempt to correct through more time travel, which results in even more timeline anomalies.  Add to this the problem of physical and mental deterioration that is amplified by each passage through the time-loop.

Wracked with regret, one engineer finally concludes that he must travel back in time to prevent the entire time-travel project from ever beginning.  The other engineer greedily transports a copy of the time machine back in time, determined to continue exploiting the technology for profit.

There's no denying that the naturalistic acting is quite good and the production quality is remarkable for a $7000 budget; however, ""Primer"" falls into the same trap that most time-travel yarns encounter...the subject matter becomes exponentially unmanageable as the time-travellers repeatedly fracture the space-time continuum.

I mean, even the film's lead characters don't understand what is transpiring when a girlfriend's father suddenly appears as a doppelganger and collapses into a coma.  How he became involved in the project is unknown and is never explained.

Writer/producer/director/actor Shane Carruth, when asked about the film's numerous plotholes and loose ends, claims that he INTENDED for the story to lack continuity because the divergent-timeline anomalies were snowballing beyond predictability.

More than likely, Carruth himself realized that resolving all of the story's paradoxes to satisfaction would have snowballed the film's budget beyond the confidence level of its few investors.

So, Carruth left a messy storyline and a bucket of unanswered questions and relied upon his audience's gullibility to accept it as a work of art.",1523059200,,2411,5.70391061452514
8049156,5,B0007N1JC8,"I get why people call it incomprehensible, because it gets that way toward the end of the flick, but it really only made me want to A) look up analysis of the movie and B) watch it again. It's a fantastic film that doesn't hand-feed the audience; people talk the way they do in real life, not to give exposition to the audience. It's a very different experience to be an audience member who has to figure everything out instead of being told. I love Primer.",1522108800,,457,4.325581395348837
8049157,5,B0007N1JC8,Low budget time travel! It's a wonderful journey through the idea of paradox and the inevitable failing of humans toying with time.,1521072000,,131,5.0
8049158,3,B0007N1JC8,"I am the person who is always complaining of the ""lack of realistic plot""or ""remotely plausible"" movies. Well now I see why I don't see more of those, by my definition. This movie definitely has a plot and is more like a personal documentary than a for entertainment only endeavor. So why 3 stars? I watched it twice and enjoyed it. If you asked me what it was about in detail i'd say the characters invented a machine that warped time. I don't know what that means and I am not sure exactly how it affected the characters, with the exception that I know it was a negative effect. How or why I don't know and as good a movie as it was I'm not going to watch it a third time to try to figure it out.",1518912000,,698,4.065217391304348
8049159,5,B0007N1JC8,"This is a low budget movie but not low quality.  Proof for me is that it's stood up to repeat viewings over years.

A review of Primer probably deserves more words but I think others have said it as well as I could.  If you like story and atmosphere, watch this.",1518825600,,262,4.098039215686274
8049160,5,B0007N1JC8,"No, lower budget than that.  No, still lower: 5 guys and gals shot this movie on consumer video equipment and busted the limits on all their credit cards to make this happen, Because They Had An Awesome Script.  At least, that is what it looks like to me.  I am probably wrong.

Anyone who says they fully understand this movie is over-qualifying themself.  (I have some experience with time travel, having written my own time travel novel.)  But the movie asks all the right questions about Time Travel.

My take on this trip, and I use ""trip"" in the hallucinogenic sense, is that 2 practical/theoretical scientists, while working on one side project to make money, stumble on a completely unexpected physical effect to one of their experiments.  Using Scotch-tape, bailing-wire, Radio-Shack tech, and duct tape, they build a time machine that allows them to go back in time approximately one day, and ""relive"" that day.

Enjoy!",1518220800,,929,4.903846153846154

Do you want to put that much work into a movie? If you do, this is for you.  If not, it's still a cool movie.",1518048000,,285,3.639344262295082
