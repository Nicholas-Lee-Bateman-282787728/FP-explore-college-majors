8758495,2,B01EG1R9H0,"Matt (Joe Frese) goes missing in Akron, Ohio while cycling across country to visit his family in Boston. When he falls off the grid, his family comes to look for him, only to discover he has fallen prey to a bunch of bad actors. They opt to investigate and you could write a better script at this point.

The acting was bad with a special shout out to Octavious Maximus (seriously?) who played Terrance and I hope has luck with his other profession. The film also had bad hollow sound as well as bad puns concerning ""dark meat"" and ""having for dinner"" used with every comedy cannibal film out there.

If you like this type of film, I would recommend ""Microwave Massacre"" (1983) instead.

8758497,3,B01EG1R9H0,"Urban gore is a market I feel that is so wide open now. In the last decade, you had Terrence Williams putting out films like  Horno and  The Hood Has Eyez. This had me excited that we would get something unique and different. The sad thing to that is, we did not get barely any. Unless you know the film festival circuit and the films they play, there was not too many to talk about.  Urban Cannibal Massacre is something that I feel may be the inspiration that other young up and coming directors need to go for it. The film centers on two doctors named Sybil and Ruben Jones. They are perceived by the community to be running a soup kitchen to help homeless people. Like most cannibals they start to encounter some problems. The first in that their own daughter has become a vegan. You would think that could crash your world instantly. The second problem in the form of a young woman and her boyfriend looking for her lost brother Matt, who was last known to be at the Joness soup kitchen. This film has such a dark odd tone to its comedy that I found myself laughing more than I expected to. The gore and killing in this film shows that this film has some very big balls to go in that route. The acting in this film is low budget camp, but it added to the fun of this film.

The film is very low budget, and does have some issues with pacing and at times it felt like the characters were lost during a back and forth conversation. This film also seems to be wanting controversy and getting the audience to react. There is a scene when Matts sister who is white and her boyfriend who is black, go inside the soup kitchen. Matts sister is the bitch, when she leaves to go to the bathroom, you have the boyfriend who is eyeing the Joness daughter and making a comment that he is vegan as well. During this exchange Ms Jones makes a comment that she is shocked that he likes the  dark meat women. It is moments like that, that showed me this film was gearing not only to be a horror film but also one that can get people talking. I hate the name change to this film.  Urban Cannibal Massacre sort of sounds very low rent, that unless you are urban or a fan of urban you will not get this film. I would have liked a more universal title like the original,  Meat the Jones. I am a fan of any time a genre can change itself. I feel the experience of new blood coming in and wanting to give us sparks is always welcome. The film has a ton of promise, has some very good gore and most of all has a very odd sense of humor that works. Maurice Thomas is going to have a very loud voice in this genre in the upcoming years. This is a fun little film that while problematic, is at least entertaining enough.",1469664000,,2698,4.166986564299425
