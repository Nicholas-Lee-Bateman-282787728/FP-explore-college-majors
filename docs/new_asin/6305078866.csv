7883151,3,6305078866,I have been searching for a documentary that goes through this information and analyzes it. I saw it once and then wanted to show it to someone. This one is very bare-bones. It simply gives the information.,1388361600,,206,4.594594594594595
7883152,1,6305078866,"There is a minimun of production on this 31 minutes tape. It does not reveal anything interesting to the topic. This was so far the worst documentary I have ever seen. It was boring to watch this, and it does not prove anything. It only shows again some poor footage that the goverment provided. Quite expensive for such poor production",1092268800,5,336,4.616666666666666
7883153,5,6305078866,"The government did not make a big deal about Roswell. UFO ""researchers"" [and I use the word loosely]brought forward unsubstantiated stories from witnesses 40 years after the fact. Witnesses  can't accurately recall what happened 15 minutes ago but we're expected to  believe people 40 and 50 years later! Because of the speculation, the Air  Force did a thorough research job [unlike Randle and those others] and  found that the actual ""crash"" was debris from a downed weather  balloon from a top secret project at nearby White Sands. This caused the  initial controversy as the Air Force couldn't then reveal this. Then the  witnesses confused other events and instances under encouragement from the  UFO cult. This tape explains this.",942969600,9,736,5.177966101694915
