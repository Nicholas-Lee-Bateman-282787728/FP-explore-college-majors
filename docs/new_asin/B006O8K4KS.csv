8501657,5,B006O8K4KS,"This DVD is the perfect companion to the West Berlin 1985 Concert and the Peterson bio ""Life of a Legend."" My wife and I have watched the West Berlin 1985 DVD perhaps a few dozen times so the bonus section on this one with Peterson, Pedersen and Drew speaking and doing brief demos added that human dimension that we craved.

Also, the short theme song of the BBC show (a Rick Wakeman-like rock rendition of) the Paganini 24th Caprice is immediately followed by the OP Trio's own take on those 16 bars -- like the perfect ""audio dessert.""",1436486400,,538,4.489795918367347

8501660,5,B006O8K4KS,"Oscar Peterson is justly celebrated as one of jazz's greatest pianists, but he's less well known for his compositional achievements. Happily, we now have this DVD of the premiere recording of one of his signature works, the Easter Suite. The nine-movement composition was commissioned by the BBC's South Bank Show and broadcast throughout Britain on Good Friday in 1984. Accompanied by his longtime drummer Martin Drew and the great Danish bassist Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, Peterson delivers his interpretation of the Easter story through the basic language of jazz, embellished with blues, classical and gospel elements. Although the music is inspired by the passion and resurrection of Jesus, one can set aside the spiritual connotations and focus solely on the music itself, which is straight-ahead, swinging, soulful Oscar Peterson jazz. Filmed in the intimate confines of a BBC television studio, it's like having a front-row seat at one of the pianist's gigs. Icing on the cake is a fascinating interview with South Bank Show host Melvyn Bragg, in which Peterson breaks down his approach to writing the suite as well as his musical interaction with Drew and Pedersen. It's a fascinating discussion, and a perfect complement to an enthralling and inspiring performance.",1330819200,3,1279,5.3681592039801
