8410476,3,B003ZJ951I,"Surprisingly poignant tale of a young woman who's life is destroyed by various factors. Young Linda is from a small French village and runs away from home at a young age seeking excitement in the big city. Immediately off the bus she is stalked and raped (at a carnival no less). This sets her life on a downward spiral that ends in drugs and suicide. Was expecting, and to be honest hoping for a sleaze-fest, but this movie was actually a rather gripping tale. It's very down beat but does feature plenty of full frontal female nudity. Most of the sex scenes are lesbian and the occasional heterosexual sex scenes are usually jump cut from plopping on the bed to the couple laying around after the deed has been done. No male nudity that I could recall if that's your thing. Not a great ""date"" movie, but still a very well-done, gritty and somewhat shocking film.",1436745600,,864,4.544871794871795
8410477,4,B003ZJ951I,"I'm buying up these Mondo Macabro Jess Franco releases, and they really are rare, prime, juicy pieces of personal movie pleasure. Sinner: The Secret Diary Of A Nymphomaniac is a total replacement of my GO Video UK VHS dub, and I'm mostly thrilled with the product. The movie runs close to 87 minutes in length and has an unusual almost 1.66:1 (16:9) aspect ratio that places small black bars on each side of the screen. English or French dialogue options are offered with newly created optional English subtitles. The picture quality is mostly decent DVD-standard quality, though I noticed some ugly dark pixel noise in the shadows during the opening scene. This was very evident as the scene is lit with red light. Other than this mess, the picture is nothing to complain about and of course is a nice upgrade from my old, dying VHS.

The movie, from 1973, features Montserrat Prous as a runaway, who sets up her suicide to appear as murder; and the wife of the supposed killer is set up by police to investigate. It's an odd premise for a story, but it's told via her underworld friends, lovers, acquaintances and via her secret diary during the course of this woman's personal investigation. You watch her go from naive schoolgirl being sexually assaulted by dirty old men, to seductress, prostitute and pornographic model; but what you really see is how lost this girl was. Was she leading herself or was she led? What happened in her life that would cause such horrible outcomes? Jacqueline Laurent, Anne Libert, Howard Vernon and Kali Hansa also have notable roles.

Special Features include text-based ""About The Film"" and ""Cast & Crew"" profiles, a 10 minute analysis of the movie by critic Stephen Thrower and two other features. ""Fear & Desire: Stephen Thrower on the Cinematic Currents of Jess Franco"" -18 min, and ""Girard Kikoine: De Nesle, Jess & Me"" -15 min. Both of these two features can also be found on Mondo Macabro's Lorna The Exorcist DVD, but are worth re-viewing anyway; especially the Stephen Thrower feature. He's got a very keen understanding of the appeal of Jess Franco's movies and a great way of explaining it. If you have an appreciation for Jess Franco, this is pretty engaging stuff.",1425081600,,2215,4.811023622047244

8410481,5,B003ZJ951I,Thank goodness someone is reaching back and giving these Hammer films a new life.  Jess Franco succeeds in making a very erotic film with beautiful women and good story.  I enjoyed this.,1356998400,,186,4.78125
8410482,3,B003ZJ951I,"In Jesus Franco's ""Le journal intime d'une nymphomane"" AKA ""Sinner: Diary of a Nymphomaniac"" from 1973, lovely 'Linda Vargas' (Monserrat Prous) was a young lady who had an insatiable appetite for sex (with women mostly), and whose life was on an unfortunate downward spiral. It also featured: sexy Jaqueline Laurent 'Rosa Ortiz', the beautiful Anne Libert 'Countess Anna de Monterey', Kali Hansa 'Maria Toledano', Howard Vernon 'Doctor', etc. I'll be honest, although I'm not a fan of Franco's work, I have to say this offering was not as bad as some of his other films from the same period. And the reason I liked this one is plainly obvious! Not only did we get to enjoy the lovely female-figure of Monserrat Prous, but there was also Anne Libert, Jaqueline Laurent, and Kali Hansa too (however, I'm actually in doubt as to Kali Hansa's original gender, she looked like a transsexual?). Doris Thomas 'Mrs. Schwartz - the photographer' definitely was, did you see the size of her hands, and how she picked-up and carried 'Linda' in her arms during the photo-shoot! I do know that Kali Hansa's real name was Marisol Hernandez, but she had the tell-tell signs of a transsexual (Franco has used a lot of them in his films too). If anyone can clear this up, I'd be very interested to know the verdict! I'm definitely not in doubt as to the real gender of Monserrat Prous, Anne Libert, and especially the simply delectable Jaqueline Laurent's 'chatte poilue'! In any event, this film will best be appreciated by fans of the 'euro-cult/exploitation-films' but we already knew that! The DVD picture and sound quality by Mondo Macabro is excellent. NTSC, French (English subtitles), English (dubbed), extras, NR 86 mins.

Love and Peace,

8410483,5,B003ZJ951I,"This eagerly anticipated and welcomed new release from Mondo Macabro is a breath of fresh air in the pantheon of sleazemeister Jess Franco's oeuvre, and took a lot less time to get to us than 'Lorna the Exorcist', which was announced as a new release last summer, but still hasn't seen daylight at the time of this review. Hopefully soon. It's fairly typical early 70's Franco fare with boatloads of time-honored retro nudity and fetching Euro sexkittens sporting see-through miniskirts and tops, thigh-high boots, 5"" platforms, fringed tops and skirts, dancing and writhing around like sensual slow-motion snakes on acid laced with Demerol - I ask you, what's not to love?

It opens exactly like 'Succubus' starring Janine Reynaud and a slew of other Franco flicks from the late 60's/ early 70's (but I'm not inferring this is necessarily a bad thing) as well as Lucio Fulchi's 'Perversion Story' (with the ever-enticing Marissa Mell) from '69, where two attractive women perform Sapphic sexual scenarios before a live, paying audience in some seedy Spanish nightclub where voyeurs find heaven here on earth. This flick was made shortly after the tragic death of Franco muse actress Soledad Miranda and prior to his 'discovery' of Lina Romay the following year and stars the comely Montserrat Prous in the lead role, Anne Libert, Jacqueline Laurent and Kali Hansa as the other delectable Eurovixens. The entire film devotes itself to the exposure of the underbelly of the beast that is the miasma of strippers, prostitutes, drug parties, alcoholic abuse, lesbos, nymphs, swingers parties and porno sets - again, what's not to love? It's a Garden of Eden for sleaze enthusiasts everywhere, so suck it up and rejoice my brethren; it's exploitation at its finest and filthiest. And it benefits immensely from an incredible late 60's European psychedelic acid rock soundtrack that keeps things cranked up to a healthy Spinal Tap volume level of eleven.

Franco possesses a unique disinterest in plot structure or its function, esthetic criteria is similarly abandoned, and narrative, as in Jean Rollin's work, is almost nonexistent, yet he somehow manages to apply a structural uniform to various scenes that are mesmerizing. The same cannot be said of his films as a cohesive whole, as they never quite reach that finishing line, but I don't think most fans are expecting that from Jess. He rarely changes the artistic temperature in the room, preferring the abstraction of timelessness - we watch a scene for 5 to 6 minutes where little happens or changes, yet we're still watching. It's like staring at Loch Ness waiting for a glimpse of Nessie that never appears, but still we watch with intent. It's difficult to comprehend, let alone explain to someone else who doesn't grasp this grey area of cinematic navel-gazing.

There's rarely major text statements made, content is never a condition he appears concerned with, surface and appearance is paramount, lack of complexity is always an issue, absence of plot or character development belies most if not all of his work and yet his hypnotic and deviate if not downright degenerate eye behind the camera cannot be denied. Such is the power of a good Jess Franco film, of which this is one of his preeminent examples. Even a horrid Franco flick has its moments of spellbinding lucidity, and this is why he has endured after over five decades as a filmmaker, though I may be using this term somewhat loosely as some of his films over the last two decades are little more than painful, pointless home or vacation videos that appear to have been shot by someone's senile grandparents. But even then, the copious amount of decadent nudity and lechery will enable most of his fanbase to feel vindicated when it's over. Though I may not be one of them, most of his offerings from the 60's and 70's are perpetual favorites I will always have a weakness for. Viva Franco! (BTW, Jess won a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010's prestigious Spanish Goya Awards).

Many thanks to Mondo Macabro for enriching our lives and erotic enlightenment with this release which is jammed with bonus goodies, and kudos to Pete Tombs for uncovering this tasty little morsel of transgressive cinema - we are continually indebted to your devotion to your loyal audience, of which I am one.",1296000000,11,4313,4.969529085872576
8410484,5,B003ZJ951I,"suprisingly well made jess franco pic, with beautiful female lead. A downbeat and challenging story of young innocent womens descent into drink, drugs and the sex industry. If your expecting you're typical franco sleazefest you may be disapointed, having said that there is still quite a lot of eurobabe flesh on display here, notably the beautiful anne libert as a mysterious countess. This has a great soundtrack and overall is a very good film. This disc offers a nice transfer and some good extras. A must for all franco fans.",1293235200,15,530,4.9
8410485,4,B003ZJ951I,"I never appreciated the films of Jesus Franco till I read the excellent article by Tim Lucas in his 'VIDEO WATCHDOG' magazine on how to approach and experience a Franco film. He said ""once you have seen at least one, you will want to see them all"".  At that time, his films were not available except for extremely censored and bleached colored prints in dupey or discounted VHS tapes.  Now in the digital age , companies such as Severin Films, Blue Underground , Image Entertainment and Mondo Macabro have discovered pristine negatives of his repertoire.  Watching his films in year order, you begin to construct an incredible jigsaw puzzle of Franco's love for film, jazz and the appreciation of eroticism.  This film, 'SINNER', comes after his series of films where he bridged his love for classic monsters such as Dracula and Frankenstein and started to blend soft and hard core sex into the mix. Here we have the story of a call girl, Linda, who sets up her john and pins her own murder suicide on him. The john's wife proceeds to investigate the murder as she seeks out Linda's acquaintances and loves and inevitably gets sucked up into the same world which drove Linda to her self destruction.  All through the proceedings, Franco directs with incredible style never tipping the iceberg into sleaze territory. He also pays hommage to his earlier Vampire films 'VAMPYROS LESBOS ' and 'FEMALE VAMPIRE' with a strange Countess played by Anne Libert (the mind boggling bird woman from Franco's 'EROTIC RITES OF FRANKENSTEIN') taking over Linda's life. Franco stalwart and friend Howard Vernon also cameos as a svengali-like doctor. With crisp photography by Gerard Brissaud and a mixture of progressive jazz and rock by Jean Bernard Raiteux and Vladimer Cosma, Franco weaves his tapestry expertly showing the tragic life of a woman who wanted to please both men and women but was ultimately destroyed by the people that used her.  Mondo Macabro releases this important film in its original state, without the French producers inserting X-rated sequences not shot by Franco in order to sell it as a porn film which it is not. He would proceed to direct 'LORNA THE EXCORCIST' an upcoming Mondo release and 'THE PERVERSE COUNTESS', Franco's first erotic variation on 'THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME' .  Highly recommended to lovers of erotic film , I have really grown to appreciate the complex and driven works of the underrated Jess Franco and can't wait to discover more.",1291075200,30,2466,4.913461538461538
