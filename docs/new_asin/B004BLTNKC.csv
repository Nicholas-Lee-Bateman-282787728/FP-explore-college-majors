8422029,2,B004BLTNKC,"It made no sense. Was supposed to be like shutter island with out the explanation. The actress (Marie) starts out with a heavy French accent and about 5 minutes into the movie has no accent. I grew up with a European and never saw her lose her accent in 43 years. The other actors were ok. Well, kinda over acting but alright. I really wouldn't recommend this even to rent at redbox for $1 much less buy.",1434672000,,404,4.259740259740259
8422030,3,B004BLTNKC,"Margot Kidder was very good as well as the rest of the leading cast.  The movie, however, doesn't quite work. I think it is because of a less than stellar script and supporting actors that where not nearly as strong as the leading players.",1383436800,3,239,4.431818181818182

8422032,3,B004BLTNKC,"Filmed in 2007 and originally titled THE BOX COLLECTOR, this noirish thriller has echoes of PSYCHO and other loony mother movies, though inferior in quality.
margot Kidder employs the overwrought style of Davis or Crawford--without panache.  She's more like Rod Steiger, gleefully chomping up the scenery.
The story is incoherent with superfluous subplots and a twist ending that does little to explain all you've witnessed beforehand,
It managed to hold my interest in spite of this incoherency, so it's not a total failure.
More a rental than a keeper.",1299542400,5,554,5.224719101123595
8422033,3,B004BLTNKC,"A over protective mother (Kidder) think that the girl her son (Segan) is seeing is ruining the lives of everyone in the town.  This movie shows Margot Kidder as you've never seen her before.  After a new young woman moves next door and Harry (Segan) begins a relationship with her, Beth (Kidder) becomes convinced that everything bad that is happening in the town is her fault.  This was originally a TV movie, and it shows.  The story is good, but the acting outside of Kidder and Lyne Renee, who plays the neighbor, is terrible.  It is a very interesting movie though, and the fact that Lois Lane plays a borderline psycho makes it more interesting to watch.  This movie has a twist ending that comes out of nowhere and really changes the entire movie.  It's not a bad movie, but nothing ""Super"" either (get it?). I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - No",1297987200,4,858,4.455128205128205
