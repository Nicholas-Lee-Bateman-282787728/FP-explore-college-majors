This video will answer a lot of questions that you may have.
I borrowed a copy of this video from the public library, just to get a better understanding of ADD in adults. This video did a very good job of describing what the symptoms of ADD are in adults. It answered a lot of my questions, and much more.
The main part of the video consists of Dr. Phelan staging an informal discussion panel with four adults who have ADD, and two of their spouses, for a panel of six, plus the doctor. They each discuss what they went through as children, adults, and as parents of children with ADD.
This video also is valuable for getting a snapshot of your own situation, assuming you have been wondering if you have ADD. I recommend this vid to anyone who may have the questions, but doesn't want to come out and ask a doctor about it just yet. It is a good first step to getting help; and advice is given in that regard near the end of the video.
Whereas most things ADD related are concerned with children, the focus here is adults.
You won't be disappointed.
