These are ""traditional"" tapes we take camping (or if there is nothing on TV and we feel like watching something as a family) to watch and like the the Scooby Doo cartoons you can watch them again and again and not get tired of them.  We have watched these movies probably more than 50 times each and still love them.  I just wish they would make a Scooby Doo 3, but I guess it's not going to happen.

2599414,4,B000G1R4RK,"In the late 1960's, Hanna-Barbera cartoons such as Space Ghost and Jonny Quest were considered ""violent"" by censors and ""concerned parents"". Hanna-Barbera and Ruby/Spears created cartoons such as Scooby-Doo Where Are You! to make them happy. Scooby-Doo is an homage to 1940's radio mystery serials. It also borrows ideas from Marmaduke and The Archies. In 2002, Warner Brothers released a live action Scooby Doo movie. It was directed by Raja Gosnell(Home Alone 3) and written by James Gunn(Tromeo and Juliet) and Craig Titley. Scooby-Doo stars Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini and Rowan Atkinson. The CGI Scooby-Doo is charming and funny. The live action Scooby-Doo does justice to the Hanna Barbera cartoon and it has a lot of ""hip"", self-aware gags. There's some bodily functions humor with Scooby and Shaggy!
A young Isla Fisher played Shaggy's love interest. It's amazing that a ""family film"" such as Scooby-Doo is packed with sex appeal and cleavage! Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby are sent to a theme park to solve a mystery and stumble upon a shocking secret from the past. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar are fine as Fred and Daphne. Matthew Lillard not only wears a green and brown Shaggy costume, but he sounds like the Casey Kasem version of Shaggy. Linda Cardellini is a good actress and she seems convincing as the smart, witty, intellectual Velma. Cardellini is sexy, too. Cardellini would be great as Ann Marie in a That Girl movie. The band Sugar Ray makes a cameo in the film. Shaggy and MxPx contribute covers of the Scooby-Doo theme. Scooby-Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed(2004) is a good sequel. It has most of the same cast and crew.  Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy, and Scooby investigate a series of robberies at a museum. Seth Green, Peter Boyle, and Alicia Silverstone join the cast. David Newman composed music for both films. Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo 2 are fun movies.",1345075200,,1953,5.046439628482972
2599415,5,B000G1R4RK,Super quick shipper.  I received the DVD in 3 days.  No problems noticed with the disc.  We've played it several times already.,1342915200,,127,4.681818181818182
2599416,4,B000G1R4RK,"I was seriously dreading the first Scooby-Doo movie. What was conceivably a very, very bad idea turned out to be a surprisingly good film with a fair amount of comedy. Originally a Mike Myers vehicle (thank God THAT didn't work out), but then recast with I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream actors, the realization of Scooby-Doo as a CGI character interacting with live action actually works. I'd say it was a one in a million chance but Raja Gosnell managed to pull it off.

The most impressive transformation tho is not cartoon Scooby to CGI Scooby but Matthew Lillard's performance as Shaggy. No way would I have believed he could possibly take on the role of one of my most fave characters ever but he just seems to completely disappear and the spirit of Shaggy takes him over. He brings some real integrity to what is widely regarded as an artless family movie. Even Freddy Prinze Jr. seems to nail the voice and narcissism of Fred, and Sarah Michelle Gellar is quite good as Daphne. Though I was always more attracted to Velma as I really dig nerdy chicks. Linda Cardellini brings some true sex appeal to the role. I wish the never-seen lesbian kiss between her and Daphne never got cut out.

Of course the plot is the usual baloney but there is constant action and invention to keep even the most impatient viewer stuck on till the end. The gang go to a theme park resort called Spooky Island (actually an Australian resort) to solve the mystery of why the wild spring break kids are turning into well-mannered nerds. But not only are there guys in masks but there are some REAL spooks too. I would have liked Rowan Atkinson to have a bigger role as Emile Mondavarious but considering the twist (which comes as an amusing surprise) at the end, the plot doesn't really have room for it. It's good to have him in there though instead of a cast full of 20-somethings. But 99% of the comic genius comes Matthew Lillard.

The CGI has dated somewhat since its release. Scooby and the various demons don't look very photo-realistic anymore and it's a little bit distracting. I doubt the target audience will care.

An unfairly trashed and fun movie, but the sequel is better.

As a Scooby fan I may be a bit biased but how anybody can deny that Scooby-Doo 2 is just great entertainment is beyond my understanding. It ain't high are but it's loads of fun, and there are plenty of in-jokes for the wiser viewers. The movie is fairly mindless, otherwise it would lose its kid audience. but that doesn't mean there's no good humor or plot to it.

Granted, the plot is dumb (the gang go up against all the monsters from the first season of the TV show, only this time they're real). The manic set-pieces just bombard us, one after the other. Once again, there's not a moment of boredom, but there are enough quieter scenes with the Mystery Inc. gang. The main stars are, as usual, Shaggy and Scooby. Matthew Lillard is dead-on as Shaggy, so much so that he actually replaced Casey Kasem as his animated voice.

One moment that requires major suspension of disbelief is not any scene featuring sludge monsters or a cotton candy ghosts but a scene in which Velma utters 'I'm not hot'.

NOT HOT!!!???? WHAT??? She's a total babe, more so than Daphne. Every frame of her is a work of art as far as I am concerned.

The CGI effects this time round are thankfully superior to the trashy effects of the first film. It's a much better movie all round and will not fail to amuse anyone of any age.

The Blu Rays in this 2-disc set present each movie in 1.78:1 1080p with non-HD Dolby 5.1 sound and a decent amount of extras. The first film looks good, but the sequel looks much better. Both have bright, colorful cinematography though the low-res CGI of the first let it down overall.",1342224000,3,3777,4.516837481698389
2599417,5,B000G1R4RK,"I don't know if I'd like it as a kid, but I know my son can watch this over and over. I can say that Matthew Lillard has the voice, walk and overall demeanor PERFECT for Shaggy. I don't think they could've cast someone better. Again, a great way to get two movies in one!",1338768000,,271,3.9454545454545453
2599418,5,B000G1R4RK,"This incarnation of ""Scooby Doo"" is great-- the writing, the acting, the way everyone LOOKED; perfect. I can't praise the actors enough for these two movies! They got the characters right, and actually looked and sounded like they'd been pulled off of the screen. Loved it, adorable, and written right. Not to mention the in-jokes from fans that they threw in for us. And, the chemistry between real-life couple Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect. And Linda Cardellini was awesome as Velma as she looked and sounded like her, but still gave her a hotness that was never there before. And Matthew Lillard... oh, he WAS Shaggy. Just... if you're a Scooby Doo fan, get these two. (Not the made for ""Cartoon Network"" ones.)",1336262400,,741,4.84251968503937

2599424,4,B000G1R4RK,"I ordered the Double Feature Scooby-Doo movies for my son for Christmas. He tells me that there is only one movie (the first one). I thought that must be a mistake. So I tried everything. Checked to see if there were two discs; there was only one. Checked the disc menu; it was for only one movie. Skipped through the scenes to see if the second one would start only after the first had finished (I was trying everything). Finally, I tried the other side, and there it was. Need to indicate that both sides of DVD work.",1324857600,,519,4.3061224489795915

2599426,4,B000G1R4RK,"I thought these were a good big-screen adaptation of the cartoon series.  They did a good job selecting the cast as well, in my opinion.  The atmospherics in the film were very reminiscent of the cartoons themselves, and the sets were done well too.  I'm not sure I would advise that kids under the age of 12 view the first movie due to the supernatural premise behind the plot, which may frighten little ones some.  Other than that, on the whole, these were entertaining.  I would add in closing that the movies run a little shorter than the typical film (less than 90 minutes), but they manage to deliver pretty solid entertainment in that timeframe.",1321142400,,652,4.6347826086956525

This made a great birthday gift for them that their older sister could afford to purchase on her limited funds.",1316822400,2,268,4.583333333333333
2599429,3,B000G1R4RK,"Each movie comes in one disc, but both come in the same case, which is sad. Each Scooby movie deserves its own case to be displayed on the shelve. The case is very poor, with big holes behind the disc, which makes it fragile.
The picture quality of the 1st movie is great, but the 2nd isn't so good. I think it's an upgrade from the DVD, but it's far from what high definition could bring.

And my final request: Warner Bros, PLEASE, start including brazilian portuguese audio and subtitles in all your movies! I'm brazilian and it's sad that I can't watch the movie in my main language, since this title isn't avaiable in my country (and I bet it will take YEARS for it to become avaiable).",1314057600,2,691,4.3565891472868215

Furthermore, the DVD is a 2-sider, so you have to flip it over to watch each film.  There are inexpensive copies of the INDIVIDUAL, WIDESCREEN films available from Amazon resellers and I encourage you to avail yourselves of their excellent services.

Do not, in any event, buy this mutilated cheat.

2599435,5,B000G1R4RK,"This is a review of the Scooby Doo 1&2 Collection on Blu-ray. They are both widescreen movies and look great. I was in middle school when Scooby Doo was first released in theaters, so I'm heavily biased when I say that the 1st movie is awesome. If you like these two movies even a little and own a blu-ray player, you definitely MUST buy this collection. The picture quality is great and this movie is shot very well with colors that pop. It looks really great on my flat screen. Sound is also great. I think this is a well done blu-ray of these two classic movies. And CGI Scooby looks very nice in HD. Yes, its all in high definition.

The only con I can think of is that the bonus features of the 1st movie was obviously shot in full screen but stretched to widescreen for the blu-ray, and I have yet to figure out how to squeeze it back to the normal aspect ratio.

Overall, I highly recommend this product. These movies are very well made (well at least the 1st one was) and a joy to watch. The 1st movie also comes with cast and filmmaker commentaries, which are delightful to listen to as well.",1292544000,11,1101,4.2631578947368425

2599443,2,B000G1R4RK,"Just a warning to consumers:

This set is full screen, not the 1.85:1 widescreen that is listed. This is exactly the same as the previously released double feature, just with a different cover.

And I don't get it--the majority of folks who watch DVDs have wide screen TVs these days--""standard"" tvs are getting hard to even find in stores! It's almost 2010 for crying out loud--why, do manufacturers even produce ""standard"" versions of films that were originally wide? Now THAT's a mystery!

ps--I should point out that EVERY online store, including the online Warner DVD store itself, lists the incorrect aspect ratio info on this item. I tried to get this corrected on Amazon, but since I couldn't find a url to attach, they wouldn't change their listing. (Even though I have a copy of the actual dvd in my hand right now and it says very clearly ""Full Screen Version""). That's progress for you).",1249948800,30,899,4.787096774193548
