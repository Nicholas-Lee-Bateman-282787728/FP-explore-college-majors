8298981,3,B001EN89M8,"Hey, anything that gets me off the couch and moving is a good thing. Wife and I seldom listen to Leslie, preferring, instead, to just watch for her missteps during changes of pace and her occasional cheating! All in all, however, her exercises gives this 75 year old a jump start---almost each and every morning.",1517184000,,312,4.6909090909090905
8298982,4,B001EN89M8,A fun workout for the whole family. Not too difficult to keep up with.,1516320000,,70,4.071428571428571
8298983,5,B001EN89M8,"This is a very good workout from Leslie Sansone because the pace is fast, giving you a good cardio workout in a short time, which is what I'm looking for.  As usual, Leslie uses her basic steps so it's easy for anyone to follow.  The music and atmosphere is upbeat.  It is filmed in her ""black curtain"" studio (which I like) with lots of yellow accents to brighten it up.  Very cheerful.",1372032000,,387,4.333333333333333
8298984,4,B001EN89M8,"This workout dvd motivates my children to move when we can't go outside - weather reasons.  Leslie Sansone introduces each movement before she goes into it.  The movements are easy for them to follow.  My kids can move faster or slower if they want to and it doesn't matter.  They are just trying and having fun at the same time.  We laugh, because she can be silly and talks the whole time.  She makes us feel at home with her extended family in this video.  I have purchased a number of workout videos for my kids and I to do together and this seems to be a favorite.  It does have moments that are choppy but it is still enjoyable.",1358553600,,634,4.225
8298985,1,B001EN89M8,"Lots of familiar faces, and the usual steps brought to you by Leslie, however, it is a failed attempt at an actual marketable ""family workout.""  Hey look!  Kids running all around the studio like uncontrolled critters!  Leslie cooing at them like mother hen is really goofy.  The warm up is negligible, the pace of mile 1 and 2 are ridiculously choppy, fast, and poorly put together.  There is no cool down or stretch, just Leslie introducing the walkers and their kids.  It kind of reminded me of a ""just for fun in the studio"" home video, not something to be mass marketed to the general public for every day exercise.

Stick to her other DVDs!  Much better!",1320019200,6,660,4.581196581196581
