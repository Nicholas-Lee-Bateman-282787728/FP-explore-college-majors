4993581,5,B006JN87MK,"I saw this documentary on PBS and immediately googled it and purchased it on Amazon the following day!  It is fascinating, and as an art teacher, I am always on the lookout for interesting movies for my students to watch when we have an occasional sub!  So many art movies for youngsters are boring... and while this movie is not marketed to children/teens, I am positive it will hold their attention and they will be just as intrigued as adults are!  I plan on showing this to my 6-8th grade students and would recommend it to other art educators or enthusiasts as well.  I think 5th grade through college level students would enjoy this documentary.  As a small side note to anyone showing this to young students, some of Da Vinci's art works are shown which include some nudity, such as his famous Vitruvian Man sketch, so you might want to preview the movie yourself to see what you feel is appropriate for the environment/age you are teaching!",1404950400,,948,4.619047619047619
4993582,5,B006JN87MK,"In my opinion, the one of the best single DVDs on art history.  The Interviews with people in the related fields to fine art were very interesting, plus the amazing research that went into the production.",1395619200,,204,4.666666666666667
4993583,5,B006JN87MK,I teach Advanced Placement Art History and this is a fascinating detective story. I remember in the last few years when this was found and thought to possibly be a Leonardo drawing.,1395446400,,181,4.6875
4993584,5,B006JN87MK,"I am an avid fan of PBS and specifically Nova.  I find that their documentaries and reports are well researched, well written and edited in a format that is both educational and intriguing.

The Nova: Mystery of a Masterpiece did not disappoint.  I had read the original article in National Geographic regarding the mystery of La Bella Principessa (The Beautiful Princess), which is a portrait done in colored chalk and ink on vellum.  Many of the details have lead several experts, including Martin Kemp to believe that this was an artwork of Leonardo da Vinci.  I looked forward to seeing the Nova presentation.

The documentary gives both sides of the story with several experts testifying as to why they believe and why they do not believe that the piece could be done by da Vinci.  It shows the forensic work which was done in order to look at the individual layers of the drawing, the damage done when removing it from a larger tome of material, the left handed brush strokes and several other interesting details.

After watching the video, I persuaded my wife (an art teacher for 5th grade students) to watch the video as well.  After watching it, we immediately purchased the video so that she could show it to her classes.  Her classes have been enthralled with the mystery of the picture and how they go about attempting to prove that it is a da Vinci portrait.  They are often disappointed to find out that there is no definitive answer to the question ""Is this truly a da Vinci work"" but she incorporates that into her lesson and allows them to debate whether or not they think it is.

I would recommend this video to anyone interesting in Nova, da Vanci, art history or art forensics.  Also, I would recommend it to any teachers looking for a video which shows some of the scientific method or an art teacher looking to share some art history and information with their students.",1353974400,6,1893,4.648648648648648
4993585,5,B006JN87MK,"This DVD presents an incredibly compelling and convincing forensic argument and explanation, that a previously unknown and unrecognized ""painting"" of Leonardo da Vinci has recently been discovered - by the discerning ""eye"" and mind of an art dealer that confounded even the supposed art experts at a prestigious international auction house.

Presumably, the art experts at the international auction house have put their liability insurers on notice.

The claim presented in this DVD is so staggering and, psychologically, incomprehensible, that the art world has yet to assimilate or accept its import.  Yet this claim is so utterly convincing that the owner of this portrait has allegedly already received an unsolicited, eighty million dollar (U.S. $ 80 million) offer for the purchase of this seemingly ""priceless"" painting, an offer which the owner declined.

The bidding has started - with an unsolicited bid!

This intriguing world-class art ""find"" contains other compelling attributes, e.g., if this portrait is in fact by Da Vinci, this is Da Vinci's only recognized work executed on vellum.  The work is also executed in pastel.  Da Vinci is known in the art world for his experimental and varied methods and mediums in executing his artwork - indeed, one of Da Vinci's most famous of his incredibly famous works, the ""Last Supper,"" has deteriorated to near-total destruction due to Da Vinci's experimental medium in executing this work.

The COUP DE GRACE: Another interesting facet of the forensic search depicted in this DVD is the effective use of the Internet to access and attract international scholarly input from varied experts from around the world, one of which experts may have disclosed an arcane and obscure fact that became decisive in the Da Vinci attribution - trumping, and convincing even to a previously ""non-believing"" art expert.

Even if this Da Vinci portrait isn't acknowledged as a work by Da Vinci, I actually like this Da Vicni portrait better than Da Vinci's other acknowledged artworks - MONA LISA, move over.",1344816000,10,2048,5.219512195121951
4993586,5,B006JN87MK,"A very well done documentary, and I find the evidence supporting the notion the drawing is a Leonardo convincing, and the counterarguments well refuted. Granted, this is a video being watched on a TV, but I've seen enough da Vinci originals in person up close to ""know.""",1343520000,2,270,4.76595744680851
4993587,5,B006JN87MK,Very interesting --  revealing the exhaustive and detailed process that can be embraced to determine the authenticity of a painting. The high-tech tools used in the analysis are interesting in themselves.,1334361600,6,204,5.580645161290323
4993588,3,B006JN87MK,"Important note: this review contains a SPOILER - So I'm alerting you NOW. Do not continue to read this review if you want to be kept in suspense.

This 55-minute episode of the PBS series NOVA was co-produced by National Geographic and shows how the art world and scientists and inventors can work together to solve the mystery of whether an art work POSSIBLY painted in the late 15th Century - and purchased in 2007 by an art collector/speculator - is a an original by Leonardo da Vinci or a fake (or painted by one of his students).

As the film progresses you are drawn into the story as pieces are revealed. We watch as the painting - worth either $20,000 or $20 million - travels to Paris where experts on both art and art materials (what the portrait of a young woman is painted on) spend many hours trying to find the answer. I was really looking forward to the answer. Alas, the film turns out to be a ""shaggy dog story"" which really has no definitive ending. You will not learn the painting's value. Granted, the director of this film, didn't know where his story would lead or end when he started this project. This is standard for real time documentaries. But, unless new events occur - and the research is resumed - neither the director, the owner of the painting or we, the viewer, will know.

I can only recommend this to those interest in either the life and art of da Vinci or those with a fascination for forensic research, who won't mind not knowing ""how does the story end?"".

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8499508,5,B006JN87MK,"This episode is a joint National Geographic-Nova effort that explores the process of tracking down the provenance, the origins, of a piece of art that was originally listed as an early 19th Century drawing by an unknown German artist.  It didn't look like one to one expert, who bought it with the idea of showing that it was something much more.
  He pegged the style as Italian and the subject, a young woman, certainly wasn't dressed in 19th Century garb.  But could it really be an undiscovered work by Leonardo da Vinci?
  We follow the experts, who include an expert on Leonardo, another who's an expert forger, experts on the time when Leonardo lived, and several whose skills include the scientific testing of art, a forensic approach to tracing an art object.
  Along the way we find people who are convinced of the possibility that it is indeed a work of da Vinci, and others who are skeptical, some very skeptical.  One by one, the various tests fail to prove that it cannot be a da Vinci.
  Is it really a da Vinci?  Perhaps.  Nothing proved it otherwise, but there is always that doubt.  If you like a good whodunit and would like something different from the usual fictitious search for the blunt instrument that ""done in the victim""; if you like art and really understand it (or not -- I'm no artist, and my tastes are the usual run-of-the-mill ""Hey, I like that one!) you may very well enjoy this exploration into the world of art.  I have done that several times now.",1410912000,,1484,4.568181818181818
