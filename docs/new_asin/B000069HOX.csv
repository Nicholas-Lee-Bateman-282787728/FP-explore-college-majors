1732582,1,B000069HOX,"Hitch-hike is one of those small movies you watch becouse you hope that becouse of it's budget they would spend some real quality time on the script and try to make up for it by giving us a good move ie- Night Of The Living Dead, Holloween, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mad Max, and Blair Witch.
  So it sould come as no surprise that this film is as bad as those movies are good. David Hess plays a hitch hiker picked up by a husband and wife couple. After getting into thier car he reeks havok with thier lives. I don't know if the movie The Hicher with Rutger Hauer came before or after this but either way it is a much better film. THat movie was suspensefull where as this movie is just tiersome. By the end you don't really care who wins just that the movie ends.",1083888000,,766,4.1
1732583,3,B000069HOX,"Ah, the wonderful warped world of David Hess. How I love it.
Ever since the first time I saw ""Last House On The Left"" - I've been infatuated with this man's ability to be a monster. He's tremendous at it, and that's what compelled me to buy this movie sight unseen. What do I think? Well,...
""Last House On The Left"" and ""House On The Edge Of The Park"" are a couple of my favorite movies of all time. This coupled with the knowledge I've read on the internet claiming the character Hess plays in this movie is very similar to the aforementioned 2, I had to check it out. David Hess is outstanding in the movie as his usual typecast character. But the movie, umm well, it's ok.
The film is about a husband and wife that pick up a hitch-hiker (David Hess) and trouble obviously ensues. The plot is a little weak, (ok, very weak) - and the audio is a little out of sync. But the movie moves along at a surprisingly quick pace, being that there isn't THAT much killing and/or violence. There are some quality dialogue from Hess and Franco and some quality shots of the wife (I forget her name) nude. Small amounts of violence scattered throughout. (Though not nearly as much as I was hoping for)
In comparing this movie to Last House and House On the Edge, I would have to say it is a failure. However, looking as a stand alone movie without comparing it to the aforementioned films, I would say it is an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half, even if it's just for Hess's faces and dialogue and the wife's body.
The dvd looked good for the year the film was made and the budget I'm sure it was made on. Pretty clear, not too much grain or dirt. The audio is acceptable and there are a couple extras on the disc, a trailer and a few interviews with the cast.

1732587,5,B000069HOX,"An excellent film, sadly never released in North America until recently.  David Hess (Krug from LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) plays a hitch-hiker who just robbed a bank and double-crossed his partners to keep the money for himself.  Along the way, he meets up with a ""problematic"" couple and hitches a ride.  From there, we're treated to fist fights, double crossing, cops being killed, more double crossing, rape, and yes even more double crossing.  This one truly is a 5 out of 5.  To start off, the cinematography is amazing.  And even though this only played overseas (25 years ago!), the image on the DVD is stunning.  Every single shot is crisp and picture perfect.  We can all hope that the upcoming LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is this good.  You also get the european trailer, and a 17 minute documentary with the director and the 3 stars (including HESS).

1732647,5,B000069HOX,"Just when I thought I have seen all the best Italian films from the 70's...along comes the Hitch-Hike (1977) with Franco Nero, Corrine Clery, and David Hess. I found this film while researching Nero's filmography.  I have seen a lot of his earlier films, but not that many after 1975.

The film follows a young couple getting back from their camping trip, who on their way to Los Angeles stop to pick up a hitchhiker.  The hitchhiker turns out to be an escapee from a mental institution/prison.  It is crucial to know that the couple is going through some bad-times in their marriage. The characters and the movie plays out beautifully, and the ending is really surprising to say the least.  I would qualify this film into a strong psychological-thriller-drama.  This film is nowhere comparable to the American ""The Hitcher"" franchise.  The only similar movie to Hitch-Hike would be Kidnapped (aka Rabid Dogs) from 1974 directed by the famous Mario Bava, both of which are of Italian production.

Some interesting facts about the Hitch-Hike production:

1. Hitch-Hike was filmed completely in Italy's region of Abruzzo (province of L'Aquila) which geographically resembles the terrain of Northern California.  Highway signs were posted in English to further resemble California, and even a special American version of a gas station was built, not to mention highway  However, it does not take a genius to realize that the road(s) the actors are driving on look very much European as compared to the wide and vast highways of California.

2. Franco Nero who was playing the main male character Walter Mancini (an alcoholic news reporter married to a wife with wealthy parents) had a broken hand during the filming. He originally broke his hand while on the set of Sahara Cross (1977).

3. Supposedly, Nero got the role of Adam Konitz (the psychotic hitchhiker) for David Hess because the two actors knew each other from shooting a movie together a year earlier.",1413504000,6,1960,4.975460122699387

I have only recently began viewing foreign movies.  Initially I started out with only Japanese movies because I have such an interest in that culture albeit I am not Japanese.

These movies were so satisfying for the most part that I decided to see what other cultures had produced.  I heard about this movie many years ago in that it was a good movie.  I think if I would have known the full story I probably would not have purchased this film.  Having said that I must say the production of the film is very good.  The acting is spot on, especially the wife who is a very lovely woman for sure.

1732678,4,B000069HOX,"I bought this DVD on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The movie was filmed in Italy and had the feel of a spaghetti western, though it wasn't a western at all.  What really surprised me was the quality of the DVD picture.  It was crystal clear even though the movie was initially released in 1978.  Corinne Clery played the part of Eve, a sexy wife that constantly bickered with her husband.  The music was awesome.  It went back and forth between a type of hillbilly banjo music and gypsy music more reminiscent of Romania.  The music made the movie in my opinion.",1312588800,,567,4.446601941747573
1732679,4,B000069HOX,"I got this film for two reasons: Corinne Clery and Franco Nero. I've always liked Nero, but can't really say why. He always has such an imposing on-screen presence. My earliest memories of him were in the above average war movie ""Force 10 From Navarone'. As for Clery, she first came to my attention as a 'Bond girl' in 'Moonraker'. Both do a pretty good job of portraying a very unhappily married couple that is taken hostage by evil David Hess. I recognized him from the horror classic, 'Last House on the Left'. Doing a little research, I found that Hess was formally a songwriter, and it was none other than Hess who composed 'Speedy Gonzalez', one of singer Pat Boone's biggest hits! What an interesting career this guy has had.

Nero does a fine job as a drunken jerk, an alcoholic writer on holiday with his wife, Clery, when they pick up a hitch-hiker, Hess, an insane crook who is on the run. Not only from the law, but his two partners, who he doubled crossed to the tune of $2 million. There's a deadly encounter with the police, and a gentle warning, it's brief but graphic, then a reckoning with the two jaded partners, who the couple thought, at least for a moment, might be their salvation. Konitz (Hess) then directs the terrified, exhausted couple to a remote location, where he proceeds to brutalize not only Nero but his wife, including a memorable rape scene in which Nero is tied up and forced to watch. While David Hess succeeds nicely as a brain damaged maniac, he really does overplay his role at times, coming across as a bit over-the-top. As for the ending, I won't give it away, but can honestly say I didn't see it coming.

All in all, this is a really unique Italian thriller. There's a certain feel to Italian movies that is somewhere between cheesy and edgy....a combination of disturbing realism and a strange taste for bombast and buffoonery. I've noticed it in nearly every Italian-made film I've ever watched. The DVD quality is excellent, and it shows best to highlight the scenic Gran Sasso mountain area of Italy where the movie was filmed. One of the few obvious flaws in the film....the director took great pains to make it look like the American West/Southwest, but with the gas stations, forgot to change the prices! Watch carefully, and it looks like the signs say $5-something a gallon. A tad high for 1977. It was actually the Italian pricing of $5 Lira per liter. Last but not least is some very minimal but impressive music by Ennio Morricone.

Nero, Clery and Hess all give memorable performances. Some of Nero's more highly praised films have been my least favorites...'Keoma' for example. Far from being 'the last great Spaghetti Western made', as is often claimed, it was a seriously flawed film. Clery was (and still is) gorgeous, with several nude scenes and looking absolutely stunning. David Hess, despite being a camera ham at times, is totally believable as a criminal psychopath. The DVD has some spartan extras, including 'The Devil Thumbs A Ride', featuring interviews with the stars. Among the more amusing recollections, how Franco injured his hand while filming 'Keoma' (he punched a horse!), which resulted in Corinne doing most of the vehicle driving for 'Hitch Hike'. The bandage you see Nero wearing on his hand in the movie is real. There's also an funny story about one of the fight scenes involving Nero and David Hess, in which Nero supposedly broke David's nose.

All in all, a bizarre and eerie film well worth the Amazon price.",1270771200,12,3501,4.725040916530278

1732682,5,B000069HOX,"'Hitch-Hike' is a tough, slobbering road movie starring David Hess - perhaps the most hyper-brazen villain in modern cinema (Andrew Robinson in 'Dirty Harry' gives him a run) - and Franco (""what's in the coffin?"") Nero.
Hess is a bank-robber/mass-murderer on the lam, Nero is a boozy journo on a hunting trip. They collide; there's sparks, much unpleasantness and a graphic finale. Straightforward hitch-hiker from hell stuff, right?

Wrong. There's a complication... in the torso-trembling shape of Nero's wife, played by bountiful Corinne Clery.
A ridiculously good-looking woman who could smelt steel; her infernal hotness is a grind-that-playback-button; cold-shower-insufficient; missus-hiding-in-the-wardrobe distraction. As if just seeing her walking or sitting in a truck wasn't enough -- in 'Hitch-Hike' she strips....and strips and strips!
Funny how there's some clich's you never tire of...

Anyway, she becomes the filling in a Hess/Clery/Nero sandwich; a situation so provocative to the male protagonists, they try to do for each other in increasingly violent and desperate ways.
Ultimately, they night-fight in front of her (she's naked of course), an event which fills her with so much worth and self-esteem, she submits to a rape by the winner, Hess, just to wind her husband up! They don't have a normal relationship to begin with, but you feel cutting up his suits, hiding his grog or perhaps plain old divorce would be a more rational reaction to her anger than sating a drunken, bloodied, sweating Hess -- but hey, she's a woman.

'Hitch-Hike' is always interesting, one gripping event or confrontation follows another: people appear, disappear, fire guns, thrust knives, aim trucks, bleed, die...but the bulk of the movie is taken up by the Hess/Nero conflict. Both as ruthless and nasty as each other, and neither remotely deserving the delicious Clery - an exceptional prize who frequently resembles a piece of prime sirloin thrown between two slavering dogs.
The thrilling cinematic image of Clery, stark naked, sporting an enormous hunting rifle is one that stays strong in the memory many moons after 'Hitch-Hike's end-credits.",1251504000,2,2153,5.401785714285714
1732683,3,B000069HOX,"Autostop rosso sangue  (Hitch Hike - 1977), is a ""B"" movie,
obviously, that will easily be overlooked and too quickly
discounted.

In reality, it stands tall for the niche story that it tells,
comprising a wide spectrum of fascinating aspects, turning the
movie into a kind of magic, along the 90 minutes.

The wide-screen cinematography is visually appealing, the
soundtrack appropriate (albeit low tech, not great).

Above all, the acting talent is phenomenal, as Franco Nero
carries the picture on his shoulders from start to finish as no
other actor could with sheer intensity, focus and hard work.

Corinne Clery is equally, if not more valuable as an actress,
with a rare combination of youthful yet classy, ravishing beauty
and sensuality that is rarely seen on screen anymore, these days.

David Hess, one of the bandits, has his moments too, convincingly
playing a bad guy escaped from a mental institution, authoring a
stick up with several others.

The number of surprises along the way never ceases, the tension
constantly building, the suspense heavy. There is a non-stop
theme of mental instability, whether it's played by the bickering
couple or the bandits, etc.

The mental state of the bad-guys is ascertained by exterior
expressions of obscene and/or tasteless humor / jokes made worse
with a non-stop patent alcoholism.

Unusual circumstances are added to the sequences, such as the
various pistols and rifles, and a number of more dead-serious
moments, namely, the  point blank shootings resulting in blood
packs going off, cars driven over a cliffs, explodions,  hostage
situations, nudity combined with brutality.

An effort is made for the work to be as realistic as possible,
with rival bandits trying to get the upper hand and seizing the 2
million in cash, for example.

An effort in realism is  shown,  demonstrated by the
vulnerability of the woman character, played by Corinne Clery,
and also the vulnerability of both Clery and Nero's characters in
face of anarchy, and unstable psychological makeups.

For example, juvenile delinquents with a criminal streak in them,
empty oil cans on a road to have the couple skid off, crash and
get robbed.

There are a number of controversial elements, nudity,  the
yelling, drinking, demented conduct, as Murphy's Law is proven
time and again, as things turn for the worse as time passes, and
as cruelty becomes a token.",1240531200,5,2391,5.087179487179487

7965638,4,B000069HOX,"Warning SPOILERS!!! I decided to revisit this Italian thriller after listening to David Hess on the extra on the Code Red's Blu-Ray of HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK (1979), where he says his character in this film is not similar to his role of ""Krug Stillo"" in LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972). I hate to argue with a dead man (Hess passed away in 2011), but I think he was wrong. I would go as far as to say that Hess wouldn't even have been considered for this role if the makers didn't want a ""Krug-like"" character.
  The film opens up with alcoholic reporter Walter Mancini (Franco Nero; THE VISITOR - 1978) on a hunting trip in Mexico with his wife Eve (Corinne Clery; THE HUMANOID - 1979). Their marriage is on the rocks as we watch Walter putting Eve in the scope of his rifle before he pulls the trigger and kills a stag. Walter is so soused that, at their campsite, where they meet Harry Stetson (Robert Sommer) and his wife Lucy (Ann Ferguson), he can't even remember his last name! (One camp-goer remarks ""I've never met an Italian yet that can hold his booze!""). The sad fact is that Walter can't even touch his beautiful wife unless he is blind stinking drunk and when he does, it is just a short leap to rape. So much so, that when Eve and Walter see two young campers making-out in the woods, Eve says, ""They're making love. We just screw!"". Walter and Eve's lives are about to change dramatically.
  While they are driving home to Los Angeles (towing their camper trailer), they hear on the radio that the police are looking for three deadly bank robbers who stole $2 million in cash, leaving a wake of death in their path. Just as soon as they hear the radio broadcast, Eve almost hits a bunch of boulders in the middle of the road (Walter is too drunk to drive), forcing her to pull over to the side of the road. They spot a man getting out of a disabled car and it is Adam Konitz (David Hess). He asks the couple for a ride, but Walter doesn't want to give him one. Eve, on the other hand, welcomes another person in the car, if only not to hear her husband's incessant drunken ramblings. We all know that Adam is one of the bank robbers (we see a dead man inside the disabled car, a bullet wound in his head) and, very soon, Walter and Eve will know it, too. They introduce themselves to each other (Adam makes an ""Adam & Eve"" remark as a sexual overture) and Adam proceeds to play head games with the couple, much of it sexual, as he begins to touch Eve in ways that Walter never dreamed of. The problem is, this couple have already been playing head games with each other, so Adam will have to work very hard to get the couple to fear for their lives, especially when he shows them a suitcase containing the $2 million in cash. We must figure out: Who is playing who?
  Driving down the road, they have a close encounter with two motorcycle cops who set up a roadblock looking for the robbers. With Adam in the back seat holding a gun on the couple, Walter talks to one of the policemen, flashing the inside of a matchbook where he has written ""SOS"". Adam knows something is wrong by the looks on the officer's face, so he shoots the two officers dead (The second officer is shot through his motorcycle helmet, as we watch his brains explode out of the back of his helmet). Instead of Adam being mad, he admires Walter's moxey. Their next stop is a gas station, where Adam stuffs a fifty dollar bill into Eve's cleavage (""I wish I was that fifty!"" says Adam) and tells her to buy two cartons of Camel cigarettes (everyone here smokes like a chimney) and two bottles of scotch. While Eve is trying to tell the Mexican clerk (Ignazio Spalla; ADIOS SABATA - 1970; billed here as ""Pedro Sanchez"") that she and her husband are being held prisoner, Adam makes a deal with Walter to write a book about his life (Walter has a reel-to-reel tape recorder in the car, which Adam talks into.). Eve can't get the clerk to understand her (He doesn't understand or speak English!) and Adam knew that because he has been to this gas station many time before. That night, while pulled over to someplace secluded, Adam ties-up Walter and makes him watch Eve being sexually assaulted (and she likes it). Then two shots ring out and Adam falls into a lake. He was shot by his two partners-in-crime, Hawk (Carlo Puri) and Oaks (""John Loffredo""; real name: Joshua Sinclair; THE LAST SHARK - 1981), who take Walter and Eve hostage and make them drive to Mexico while they hide out in the trailer with the money.
  They are then run off the road by a red tow truck, which then blocks the road. It's no surprise that Adam is behind the wheel, as he shoots Hawk in the chest and wings Oaks in the arm. Adam deceives his two partners and Walter by saying that he is driving his two friends to a doctor and letting Walter and Eve go free, but when he gets Hawk and Oaks in the tow truck, he drives the truck over an embankment, jumping out just before the truck bursts into flames and explodes as it barrels down a mountainside (It's quite a sight and Adam says to his partners, ""Bye, fa**ots!""). Adam continues on his trip with the captive couple, but just who is playing who?
  Filled with eye-opening full-frontal nudity by Corrine Clery (who says in an extra on the disc that it was her favorite role of her career), such as the scene of Adam running his hands up and down Eve's naked body as she lies next to a campfire, while a tied-up Walter is forced to watch her reach a climax, something Walter was never able to let her achieve. As I said in the beginning of this review, David Hess basically reprises his Krug role in LHOTL, demeaning Eve sexually (but the more he does, the more she likes it!) and laughing maniacally like some out-of-control mental patient, which we then discover (with a conversation with Walter as he tells his life story) that is really what he is. When he was younger, he escaped from a mental institution. But the biggest surprise this film offers is the unexpected finale, where a totally naked Eve kills Adam with the same hunting rifle Walter pointed at her on the hunting trip. She ends up saving Walter's life because Adam was about to kill him. Walter begins to look at Eve differently, the way she always hoped he would, but the temptation of $2 million in cash just becomes too tempting, bringing this film to a totally unexpected, nihilistic ending (which I won't spoil for you here).
  Directed by Pasquale Festa Campanile (who was nominated for an Academy Award in 1964 for co-writing the screenplay of THE FOUR DAYS OF NAPLES - 1962), who usually made Italian sex comedies with fantasy elements like WHEN WOMEN HAD TAILS (1970) and THE SEX MACHINE (1975), which makes this film all the more shocking. While it does have plenty of nudity, the violence (which is sparse) comes quickly, without warning and is bloody. Screenwriters Campanile, Aldo Crudo (SUPER STOOGES VS. THE WONDER WOMEN - 1974) & Ottavio Jemma (who did an uncredited rewrite of Lucio Fulci's A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN - 1971) fill this film with insults and put-downs, as Adam demeans the couple, just as much verbally as he does physically. Franco Nero is very good in his role (he said he had a ""blast"" making this film); his icy blue eyes do just as much talking as his voice and, for once, he is not dubbed by someone else (his voice is just as distinctive as his eyes). Also above average is Ennio Morricone's effective score, which consists of a plucking banjo, acoustic guitar and other spare instruments, evocative of the beautiful Mexican scenery. But oh!, that ending. It must have had the same visceral gut-punch as DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY (1974) did back in the day.
  Barely released theatrically in the United States (as THE NAKED PREY, distributed by Hallmark Releasing), this film was shot under the title AUTOSTOP ROSSO SANGUE (""Blood Red Hitchhiking"") and, as far as I can discern, this never had a legitimate VHS release in the States (The first time I viewed this film was via a copy of a Greek VHS tape that I bought at a table of a Chiller convention back in the mid-90s). This film is available on Blu-Ray from Raro Video and on DVD from Blue Underground, both uncut and in widescreen. This review is based on the DVD (released in 2010), which is basically a port of the older Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD which was released in 2002. Both contain the same spare extras, which are a theatrical trailer and a 17-minute documentary titled ""The Devil Thumbs A Ride"", where Franco Nero, Corrine Clery and David Hess reminisce about making this film. All in all, HITCH-HIKE is a tense thriller that could have only could have originated from the minds of those demented Italians.

The beginning interaction between the stars was a perfect set up for what happens. The nud scenes show her as someone no one could resist and the reaction of Franco Nero to the rape, showers a lot of regret for his lack of appreciation he has for his wife. Franco Nero brings realism to his part. Also he brought realism to the first Django, invincible, then broken, and the avenger.
