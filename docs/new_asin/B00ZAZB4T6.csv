7275327,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Can't wait to get the Bluray. It's an awesome movie but maybe not for everyone. Reading reviews and comments of other people I'm finding out that not many people really understands this movie. Some people miss completely what the movie is about. No, the real story is not about a girl that had an asthma and went to the countryside. It's about abandonment, anger, forgiveness and trust. I don't want to spoil the movie giving away details but there is a deep story within that makes the story so great. By a chance I've got to know children like Anna and I have to say the movies picks up on intricacies of Anna character that only person that was a child like Anna or personally knows one could only pick on it and express it. It's like a great artist or a cartoonist who can see the intricacies of a persons face to make the drawing stand out and look alike.
Let's put it this way - there was a reason why Priscilla Ahn released her song ""Fine on the outside"" for this movie and not before.",1440115200,2,992,4.310160427807487
7275328,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"""When Marnie Was There"" is a solid film from Studio Ghibli that explores several themes of isolation, family, and forgiveness.

Anna, the main character, is an orphaned foster child from Sapporo.  After an incident at school, she's sent to stay the summer with her foster-mother's family in a small coastal town.  She discovers a compelling emotional connection to an old house by the shore, and a mysterious blond girl named Marnie begins to appear there.  Anna's friendship and growing love for her new friend bring her to see parallels between their pasts and the pain of absent parents.

The film is multi-layered, with very believable characters and a few tear-jerker moments.  I highly recommend it.

Things I liked:
-Bits of pieces of Hokkaido culture can be seen throughout the film; for instance, her uncle appears to be ethnic Ainu (at least in part).
-The film explores some of the isolation of being perceived as ethnically foreign by your peers, even if you self-identify as Japanese.
-While never explicitly shown, Anna can be seen as a positive (rather than exploitive) example of preteen homosexual identity.

Disclaimer: I recently saw this film stateside in a movie theatre, with subtitles.  This review should not be considered representative of any particular disc release, or of the English dub.",1439164800,13,1316,5.11214953271028
7275329,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Very good movie with an interesting and unique story, however, it may not be the best for young children because they may find it confusing",1438473600,10,139,4.6
7275330,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"A beautiful, heartwarming plot about friendship and love. You might think it's cliche but it's not. This movie will touch your soul. Not in a shallow way, but in a ""bring-you-back-to-your-childhood"" kind of way. I felt odd after watching this movie..... it made me less cynical about life, and movies typically don't do that for me.

The visuals are 5 Stars. Stunning, detailed, and better than the studio's previous works. Even better than Disney's recent computer graphics, I would say (no offense to Disney fans ;) ). Something about this anime's watercolor scheme added to the beauty of the storyline itself.

BTW, the main character looks like an anime version of Shailene Woodley from ""Divergent"" and ""The Fault in Our Stars"" movies. Just an observation.",1435449600,8,760,5.072

7275332,3,B00ZAZB4T6,"I have been looking for a film from Studio Ghibli that's as good as Spirited Away, without success. Marnie is beautifully colored and animated, and it's a tender human story, but I found it just so-so. The idyllic tideland where it takes place is relaxing to ""be"" in while watching the film, and I like the film's subtle premise that nature can cure many of our urban ills. But this seems like a rather YA story with an American/western setting that was clunkily adapted in a Japanese setting. It's a nice story to watch that reminds one of basic human goodness, but it's also kinda forgettable to me, and is almost soap operatic and melodramatic. My search for something as good as Spirited Away continues....",1434758400,10,710,4.688
7275333,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"""When Marnie Was There"" is rumored to be the last film work by the famed japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli after animator Hayao Miyazaki announced his retirement. This studio is world renowned for their beautiful hand drawn animations and attention to detail not to mention killer plot lines that act as both heartwarming and ideological. I had been previously blown away by ""The Tale of Princess Kaguya"" and though that it might have been Studio Ghibli's greatest work, but then came this movie. ""When Marnie Was There"" instantly blew me away with its premise and will continue the legacy of Ghibli movies that are masterpieces.

The story centers around a young girl who had a pretty rough upbringing  and has a hard time identifying with people who spends her summer with some friends of her family. One day she stumbles upon this large house and instantly becomes attracted to it to then find out that a girl named Marnie is living there. The story kicks of from there and without spoilers, let me just say that it is magnificent. The story unravels so well throughout the film with an aura of mysticism and some deep emotional themes that are just heart wrenching. Though it is a kids movie, the film does well to explore dark themes that go through ones life without being too adult but at the same time being both significant to young and adult audiences alike.

It is not like the typical kids movies with lots of funny animations but at the same time this movie can be very meaningful to young children. If you are a fan of wonderful animation and appreciate wonderful story telling, I recommend that you watch this movie. It is wonderful in every aspect of film making and you will not be disappointed in this. I truly loved this movie and it deserves all the awards out there.

7275334,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"An excellent movie by any standards, not just that of Studio Ghibli.  I really enjoyed it, enough to see it twice in theaters, both in Japanese with subtitles.  Beautiful colors and imagery, a wonderful score (including Priscilla Ahn's ""Fine on the Outside"", and of course the strong female protagonists that are a Hallmark of the beloved Studio.  I'm really looking forward to adding the movie to my personal collection of Ghibli movies for my home library.",1434326400,44,458,5.0
7275335,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Studio Ghibli has done it again: created a gorgeous world filled with credible characters, the kind you really care about. Ana, for example, the painfully shy twelve year old girl. Well, who, boy or girl, wasn't painfully shy at that age, at least some times? And there's the visual art. Ghibli has always met the highest standards in animation, and does that again. In 'Marnie,' pay special attention to the backgrounds - to the moss between the bricks, to the flowing grass, to the lichened stones. It's gorgeous.

I won't say much about the plot because unintended spoilers would be so easy. I will say that this carries an unusual mood: eerie, but not threatening or ominous, and blends the supernatural with the here-and-now seamlessly. That brings up one small criticism of this movie, and only a small one.

It pushes the drama up a notch, it adds an edge and depth that make a movie memorable. Even so, the gentler spirit of Marie will suit many viewers. And, despite that one little thing, this one's easy to love.

7275343,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere, which makes this all the more sad upon knowing that this movie could possibly be one of Studio Ghibli's last films. Although Miyazaki wasn't in the director's chair this time around, I still had high hopes, since Hiromasa Yonebayashi also directed ""The Secret World of Arrietty""--another favorite of mine. And much like said film, this story is less action and more emotional drama as one girl discovers her family's past in the most magical and unlikely of ways.

Anna is an extremely introverted 12-year-old girl living in Sapporo, Japan with her foster parents. One day at school, she collapses from an asthma attack, upon which her foster parents decide to send her to live with their relatives for the summer; hoping that the clear air of the seaside town will help her ailment, and that the change in scenery will help lift her spirits (as she's becoming exponentially withdrawn and shutting out everyone as of late). Upon arrival, Anna soon discovers a seemingly abandoned mansion across a salt marsh--one that she, strangely enough, feels drawn to. But over a period of days, she constantly spots a young, blonde girl in the house. Finally, one fateful night, the two girls manage to meet each other, and the mysterious girl introduces herself as Marnie. And as the two quickly befriend each other and learn more about one another, Anna will slowly solve the mystery of Marnie's sporadic appearances....and just what exactly happened to her family.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Miyazaki film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and it makes scenes come alive in such a way that the lines between fantasy and reality become more and more blurred. Even something as mundane as an abandoned house is made interesting because of the lovely artwork.

And the plot is just as awe-inspiring, as this film features two of the most real and relatable characters I've ever come across, even more so if you've ever been in a less-than-perfect family situation. Both girls instantly connect over their similar situations, from having parents that are either dead or never around, to feeling inadequate, unlovable, and a burden to the people charged with taking care of them. But over the course of one eventful summer, these two will come to realize their own self worth, and that the bonds of family can transcend generations.

With a plot that has a great suspenseful mystery with constant twists and turns, this is the perfect film to watch if you, at any time in your life, have ever felt ""not good enough"", or have felt some kind of disconnect with your family. Sometimes, only by confronting our past can we ever move on, and sometimes, your past is actually much closer than you think.",1525651200,,3061,4.880769230769231

7275379,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"I absolutely loved this movie.  The main character, Anna, is a young girl who suffers from social anxiety disorder, something that I have personally never seen depicted well at all in American movies or TV shows, unless perhaps you count characters with the condition being portrayed as 'weird', 'crazy', or used for comic effect.  When Marnie Was There is different, as it portrays an extremely introverted character with depth and compassion.

Many people emphasize the sad side of this movie, but this is actually a story of isolation that ultimately shifts to one of emotional and spiritual healing.  It is beautiful, yet a more low-key movie compared to many of the other Studio Ghibli productions.  There are no talking animals, large-scale action sequences or other such things here, nor any big orchestral scores, but it has its own magic that is very profound.  Having dealt with social anxiety disorder in the past as a child/teen/young adult, I was able to identify with Anna, and inwardly rejoiced for her as she finds the friendship and understanding, and the beginnings of inner confidence she has always longed for.  I will not give away any more details or plot for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but ultimately it is not a story of sadness and despair, but one of love, hope and optimism.

I prefer this in Japanese language with English subs, as IMO the Japanese voice actors capture the characters' personalities and emotions far better than the English dub.",1501977600,6,1477,4.92741935483871

7275406,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Oh, how tragic it would be if this is the final film from Studio Ghibli. When Marnie Was There was released back in 2014 and the only release theyve had since was a co-production on The Red Turtle. They have officially announced that they are temporarily halting production following the retirement of Hayao Miyazaki. I didn't love most of the recent non Miyazaki directed films like Arrietty and From Up on Poppy Hill but they still remain superior products to most other production studios.

When Marnie Was There is my new favorite non-Miyazaki directed Ghibli film.  The Tale of Princess Kaguya had a fantastic story but I didn't love the choice of animation. The animation in Marnie is positively spectacular. I compare it to The Boy and The Beast, another popular recent Japanese animated film and there simply is no comparison. This may well be the most gorgeous hand drawn film I have ever seen and Im an animation fan going back well over four decades. Its so sad that hand drawn films are entirely dead in the United States.

When I started watching Marnie I as pining for the older Miyazaki films like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro which are filled with fantasy elements. The more recent Studio Ghibli films have moved away from the fantasy elements and that includes Miyazakis own The Wind Rises. When Marnie Was There is nothing like Miyazakis greatest films but it does turn out to be a ghost story. This is a very emotional tale and my whole family including wife and two daughters aged three and five really enjoyed it. My one issue is with the ending. It was not the ending I expected and I think the ending I imagined was better. The ending wraps up everything in a perfect little bow but it just feels too perfect and convenient. The ending certainly didn't spoil the movie for me but it hurt the overall experience.

When Marnie Was There doesnt have the magic of films like Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky or Ponyo but it carves its own notch in the Studio Ghibli library and the breathtaking animation proves that the studio still has a lot more talent even with the retirement of Miyazaki. There are certainly some moments in the film that are hard to forget.",1487894400,,2194,4.646907216494846

7275411,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"I almost want to slap anyone who gives this less than 5 stars. If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli, just watch it... there isn't anything to think about.

When Marnie Was There is a sweet, magical, and heartfelt story that might have you wondering exactly what it's about until the end. Given the tomboyish/androgynous nature of the protagonist, Anna, I thought it might be about a gender identity thing, and being so American I sort of got a confusing romantic vibe at moments that I realized at the end might have been misinterpreted. I really hope I'm not the only one who jumped to that conclusion. If I were to take any points off, that might be the only reason - I guess I felt like her very conspicuously boyish appearance was a red herring. Anyway, you probably won't guess the ending, but it's fun to try... because when it hits you, it's really special no matter what you expected. And definitely ............ keep the tissues handy ;) This one ranks high on my Ghibli favorites because it hits the tearjerk factor without being depressing (y'know.... Grave of the Fireflies....) and it doesn't have any political or moral message, it's just a really unique story of serendipity.",1486425600,,1187,4.679425837320574

On the other hand, there are certain aspects of the Marnie character that are confusing and appear inappropriate for a section of the movie. Her actions give you a creepy feeling and make you hope you are wrong about her. She appears manipulative and secretive and seems to undermine the positive messages. This may be a function of a cultural difference, but I am not sure if perhaps the confusion is intended. I don't want to spoil it, but be aware that you may be uncomfortable.

Definitely not a film directed towards children (in fact, I suspect children under 10 won't really ""get it"").  (Not that it's inappropriate for younger children - they simply won't really ""get it."")
With over 245 other reviews before mine, I'll try to add a new dimension.  To whit, this emotional tale is on the same level as the 1939 film version of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and is similarly best appreciated after multiple viewings.  My first viewing of this film was using the English language feature (just so I could become familiar with the storyline).  My second viewing was using the Japanese-language dialog, with English subtitles.  (This let me appreciate the nuances of the original work via voice inflections and the like.)  My third viewing was to focus on, and appreciate, the masterful animation.  After that, it was viewing again (and once again) just to immerse myself in the wonder of it all, and to become immersed in the storytelling, and the presentation.

I'm a huge fan of Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, The Secret World of Arrietty, and Howl's Moving Castle. This movie definitely does not disappoint and follows along the same path as the movies before it.

While being animated, I wouldn't really recommend getting this for a very young child to watch. The story line is just too advanced with more adult related concepts than children related. However, my 10 year old nephew had no problem following the story and being engrossed in the tale it told.

The movie is about a young girl (Anna) who suffers from perpetual shy-ness and a general displeasure of being close to other people. A lot of which has to do with her past. During the movie you follow the life of Anna, who leaves to spend the summer in the country to get fresh air and hopefully help deal with/get over her aversion to being around other people. While there she discovers a beautiful mansion at the edge of a marsh with an air of mystery and magic around it. Some times when Anna visits the mansion it's grand and vivacious and other times it's dilapidated and abandoned and Anna can't seem to figure out what's happening.  It's there that Anna meets Marnie, a mysterious young girl with a big secret. The film takes you through the summer of Anna and Marnie and all the wonderful things they learn, discover and get through together.

7275477,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Before Studio Ghibli went on a short break to reconfigure their production company, they completed this fine film clearly carrying on the style and tradition of their former head, Hayao Miyazaki. Based on the novel by Joan Robinson, When Marnie Was There repositions the original story from England to Japan, which also carries on the tradition of a youngster finding something otherworldly after moving to a more rural area.

Anna is a pre-teen girl with some hidden anxieties and a lack of self-esteem. After suffering from what seems to be an asthma attack, her adopted mother sends Anna to some relatives of hers in the country to recover. While there, Anna discovers a seemingly abandoned mansion near the beach, and meets a mysterious blonde girl named Marnie who she immediately bonds with. While their friendship continues, Anna learns more about Marnie's sophisticated family, although Marnie seems to miss her parents when they are away, and says she is tormented by the maids and housekeepers. Anna begins to come more out of her shell as a person during this, but Marnie and everyone at the mansion move away overnight, with a new younger girl named Sayaka moving in with her family. Sayaka and Anna become friends, but mostly at first because Sayaka mistakes Anna for being Marnie, the girl she read about in a diary left in new room. One more meeting with Marnie has Anna questioning her existence more as Marnie keeps confusing her with someone else. Marnie disappears again, but a little digging from Sayaka finding the rest of Marnie's diary and a talk with an elderly artist reveals the rest of Marnie's existence to Anna.

I won't spoil how the movie ends, suffice to say it ends the possibility of any of the obvious shipping bait that the story seemed to be setting. The hand-drawn animation really takes you back to Ghibli's glory days, and makes the film as compelling as their previous production of The Tale Of Princess Kaguya. As per usual, it was nominated for an Oscar, mostly due to the great direction of Hiromasa Yonebayashi. The film oddly enough wasn't released through Disney, but GKids who handle a lot of other all-ages foreign releases. Definitely give this heartwarming tale a look, and the kids should love it too!",1468886400,,2253,4.879895561357702

7275483,1,B00ZAZB4T6,"I'm a huge Ghibli fan. I've seen all the movies and I've watched them ever since I was a little girl. 'When Marnie Was There' started out well enough. As usual the art was wonderful, breathtaking. But the story was what really bothered me. I don't want to spoil anything but as one got deeper and deeper into the plot of this story it began to be more and more convoluted. It wasn't exactly complex as it was just rushed. The ending sounded more like a soap opera than detailed Ghibli story telling. If you're expecting attention to detail and well balanced characters, you won't find it here.",1466985600,3,593,4.5

Robinson's novel of the same name, although it transposes the setting from Norfolk, England from the original novel to Sapporo, don't expect a light hearted Studio Ghibli film!

The story itself was emotional and heartwarming and actually left me in tears while the ending credits played. The animation is stunning especially the backrounds.

If I had any complaints at all it is a few moments between Anna and Marnie almost had me rooting for a more romantic relationship which I've seen others comment on. I would have been fine with it but once later on you'll find out just why it is dissapointing some scenes came off that way.

And now the studio is all but defunct. People are asking for the wrong thing from Ghibli these days. It can't be Miyazaki forever. We had something as good or better in Yonebayashi and instead everyone gave up on him. Arietty was also amazing. I like the subtler brush this director paints with vs. Miyazaki, who's skills had begun to fade since Ponyo.

And now they're making anime series? What will become of the one of the most treasured anime productions studios in the world? Marnie hit me harder than Miyazaki has in a long time. Wonderful main character who communicated with me deeply. Only Totoro had this same depth of emotion.

Yet this character was much more grown up than Miyazaki's 'children' or charcters who seem to be stuck in a perpetual arc of heterosexual romantic awakenings. This character was much more modern, serious, and going through very true, serious issues that were wholly complicated. This film was GHIBLI growing up, and it FLINCHED.

So pathetic and sad. One of my all time favorites from them. And NOW they're defunct. Great timing, yeesh.",1462752000,,1258,4.864485981308412

7275526,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Studio Ghibli never disappoints and in WHEN MARNIE WAS THERE, the studio proves once again why it is such an esteemed producer of quality animation. Directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, this gentle and poignant coming-of-age tale is full of wonders, with elements of the supernatural.

Based on the book of the same title by Joan G. Robinson, this gentle tale tells the story of young Anna, who is immensely talented in art but who is painfully shy and reserved, to the extent that she has no friends. Concerned about her health, Annas foster mother sends her away from their home in Sapporo to stay with relatives, kind and humble farm folk in a beautiful, small, coastal town. Here, Anna quickly becomes enamored with a rather run down marsh house that seems mysterious. Anna begins to dream of a beautiful, blonde-haired girl who lives there, and when she encounters the girl in the flesh, a friendship blossoms between the two. Marnie, the girl of Annas dreams begins to exert a strong pull on Anna, and as their friendship becomes deeper, Anna begins to realize that there is some elemental, deeper connection between the two.

There are plenty of twists and turns in this beautiful film to keep viewers engaged. My eleven-year-old daughter, a budding artist was not only mesmerized by the gorgeous visuals, but also by the storyline. We both enjoyed it so much, we have watched it four times already. This is a keeper and I intend to add it to our Studio Ghibli library. I also hope that at some future time, the studio will release this in the form of a picture book as has been done with other Ghibli productions.

7275555,4,B00ZAZB4T6,"Nine Things About the Film ""When Marnie Was There""

1. Studio Ghibli is a Japanese anime production company and a force in the animation industry. Several of my favorite animated movies come from them: Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke. This is their newest (and maybe their last) movie, and it shows that they are still masters of storytelling and animation.

2. It's about a 12-year-old foster child named Anna. In the first scene, she tells us she hates herself.

3. Anna also has asthma. Her medical problems, combined with her emotional detachment, prompt her parents to send her to a beachfront community to hopefully find some health. But she doesn't know anybody in the town, so she keeps to herself. Her only ""friend"" is a grizzled old fisherman who refuses to talk.

4. There's an abandoned house by the lake, and while exploring it, Anna meets a strange young girl named Marnie. Marnie instantly proclaims Anna to be her best and secret friend, and Anna is not allowed to talk about Marnie to anyone.

5. The character of Marnie is really interesting. The movie lets you know right away that something is strange and sad about her. But you also know she's not going to turn into a demon or killer. It's not that kind of movie.

6. The two girls spend a lot of time together, as long as they follow Marnie's rules. Marnie digs Anna's secrets out of her, and starts to reveal her own, too.

7. The animation, while done mostly in the traditional style, is gorgeous. So much attention is paid to detail that the characters are basically moving through paintings.

8. The movie is about kids, and there is nothing in it that could be considered inappropriate for kids. But it's not for kids. You have to be an adult in order to feel the full effect of the movie.

9. This is not anime the way many Americans think of it: there are no robots, or weird monsters, or fountains of blood, or samurai. This movie is a quiet, elegant exploration of serious childhood issues such as neglect, abandonment, abuse, sickness, and loss. By not making things obvious, it avoids becoming emotionally manipulative. It's an honest film that draws out honest emotions.",1455062400,4,2184,4.696335078534031

7275563,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"First, about the Blu-Ray: some of those commenting here have complained about not being able to skip the promotions at the beginning of the disk to go to the movie directly instead. If they are using Cyberlink 13, 14 -- or 15 on a PC, as I do: right click on the screen; that will open a menu with an item for going to  where one can open yet another menu that offers the choice of starting at the root menu.
Now, the film:
This is the last full-feature ever to be produced by the illustrious Study Ghibli, at least while operating in the same manner that has earned it the heartfelt admiration of so many, for so many years.
It is also the Japanese version of an English ghost story, and the material cannot be stronger, originating from one of two cultures that excel in them and coming now to us through the filter of the other.
One of the two main characters is a shy pre-pubescent girl that is at war with her own emotions, but mostly keeps a grip on them and remains respectful, if distant, towards others. Except in a few occasions when she cannot help herself and lashes out. But then realizes that she was wrong and comes around to apologizing sincerely.
The second main character is the ghost of another girl of similar age, existing in a very different situation, but connected to the first one in ways that come to light at the end.
In this story, time itself bends: past and present briefly and imperfectly seem to overlap for a few minutes or a few hours, now and then, letting each girl move from her reality to the other's and back. So, in a way, each might be a ghost to the other (and there is a hint that this is the case in a rediscovered diary Marnie had kept many years before).
Magic and mystery rule; above all, this is a tale about the mystery and magic of love. It is also a very humane and moving story.
The animation is of the quality one expects in a Ghibli film. This is not about high drama and dare-devil action, as in Mononoke, or action plus deeply poetic story-telling as in Kaguya; it does not play as hard with ones emotions as The grave of the fireflies, is not as boisterously fantastic as Pom Poko, or as amusing as Porco Rosso or My neighbors the Tanakas, or as heart-warming as Kiki, to mention some of the studio's great achievements, but it is a great small piece of art all the same, as well as a feather in the cap of Hiromasa Yonebayashi that directed it (his second movie after Arrietty, also adapted from an English story).
Comparisons have been made, nonetheless, to some of those former movies by some professional critics and, in conclusion, Marnie has been declared by them to be a minor Ghibli. I disagree: those are comparisons between apples and butterflies. This movie, as those other ones of that wonderfully creative enterprise, is in a kind all its own, and should be seen that way.
As of this writing, Marnie is in the list of candidates for an Oscar in the Best Animated Film category. Given the tremendous amount of wind in the sails of Inside Out, I fully expect the latter to win the prize. Inside Out is, in my opinion, an inferior product, if brilliantly executed, since it, after all, comes from Pixar. It is about a girl of about same age as in Marnie that is also in the grip of her emotions, but the message here is that it is no big deal to act up, to the distress of others, even when ones own family is struggling with unexpected and serious problems: after all, we are ruled by our emotions and that gives us a permanent get out of jail pass. A great message to all kids out there already old enough to understand?
I think not.
So, in my heart of hearts, I am rooting for Marnie.",1454112000,6,3654,4.342105263157895

7275570,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"When the say 'All good things must come to an end' it really is something you never want to hear. In this case knowing that the studio that gave the world some of the most beautiful films of the last 30 years is closing it's doors is heartbreaking. Studio Ghibli finally made a name for its self in the western world and the whole library of its films are unlike anything you will ever experience. The final film in this collection, 'When Marnie Was There' could not have been a more perfect conclusion to Ghibli's legacy.

Based on a heart warming tale we see a coming of age story with a heart warming supernatural twist. The characters are so charming and the English voice cast chosen in Haliee Steinfeld, John C. Reille and Kathy Bates is wonderful. As always the animation is stunning and watching a story taking place in the peaceful countryside made me feel like all my stress had gone away for just a little while. However, the story is a beautiful blend of joy and sorrow as the two main characters Anna and Marnie develop a one of a kind friend ship as they peel away the layers of the pasts and share their inner most secrets with one another. It is a story filled with hope, love and loss and the ending will definitely produce a tear or more.

For me, tears were definitely shed just knowing that the pioneering team of Miyazaki and Takahata have 'officially' concluded their epic adventure into the world of animation. They proved that animation is a genre that can be developed for all kinds of audiences and that traditional cell animation is an art form that is far from dead. Each time they exposed new wonders and dived ever deeper into its beauty and their product as well as their awards, have shown that time and time again.

Complete your Studio Ghibli journey with this heartwarming conclusion and I am sure you will happy that you did.

7275593,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"When Marnie Was There is an excellent film, and it has one of the best portrayals of anxiety and depression I've ever seen in a movie. The only problem with this is that early in the movie, Anna's actions had me disliking her after she insulted a character out of the blue that was seeking her friendship (in a slightly annoying way). However, I have friends and family with depression/anxiety, and I've seen them say and do horrible things with no regards for the feelings of others, even if they would never do that on a normal day. Like all Ghibli films, the animation is superb, but there are parts of it that are slightly different in this film, especially the colors and some of the extra details. The story is interesting, in that like other films from the studio, if it had been made in America it might have been a horror movie, but since their culture has a different view on spirits it's instead a beautiful story of love and friendship. I don't want to say too much to avoid spoilers, but the climax and ending to the film is perfect, it  was so amazing that I couldn't help crying uncontrollably, something I hardly ever do. To put it simply, I loved this movie, and I'd highly recommend this to everyone of all ages and inclinations. With this being the first Studio Ghibli film without its creators (Miyazaki especially) but the amazing quality and originality of When Marnie Was There gives me hope that there might be more excellent films from them in the future.",1451779200,4,1480,4.543071161048689

The voice cast in both English and Japanese was fantastic and the setting was so well established that I felt like I was there. ... HOWEVER... If you're watching this film in the hopes that Miyazaki's organic storytelling and pacing has lived on in his crew you will be disappointed. While I was able to follow the story it was very structured. It lacked cohesion and there were long periods of film time where the characters felt vaguely incomplete. The relationships between characters were either rushed, neglected or simply assumed if that makes sense. There are subtle emotional bonds that were meant to drive the main characters forward and while some were left completely unexplained, others were shoehorned into the flow of the dialogue rather uncomfortably.

Basically it's a beautiful movie with a great over-all story but it's clumsily written, so much so that it almost ruins the film.

Though it is based off of a book it is still well told and keeps you interested on what is going on from beginning to end. You have various feelings for the main character and by the end you're blinking from the twist that comes about. A well told story with subtle changes in the art to really add to the feelings.

The art is just as lovely as you come to expect from Studio Ghibli such detail and care it taken not only to bring the characters to life, but the world around them. It is not easy to make a girl with little to no emotion come to life and show emotion, and yet they did it.

Another movie I am glad I have in my collection. I will admit there are points were it is quite sad but there are happy moments too bringing everything to a close as they answer all the questions and giving you a proper and satisfying ending. I will admit this movie is probably not for everyone as it does dill around some death and adoption and how the main character deals with such things.

I've ordered the book, but it hasn't arrived yet (Studio Ghibli has introduced me to several authors I haven't read before), but the book had better be pretty damned good to outshine the anime.  It isn't a Miyazaki or ""Paku"" Takahata production, but it's really great.  The background scenery is pure Ghibli animation magic (as usual), the characters are great and ""3D,"" and the story is compelling and beautifully told.  One thing I noticed (only one other review I read even alluded to it) is the social commentary embedded in the story, which would be completely obvious to any Japanese viewer.  The mansion was a vacation home for ""foreigners.""  Marnie is blond-haired, blue-eyed, and has very fair skin.  Anna has blue eyes.  One of the main reasons Anna is an outsider and has huge feelings of self-loathing is that she is obviously not 100% ethnic Japanese.  That is why she blows up on the class president girl (whose name I can't remember).  Studio Ghibli is making a very powerful statement against racism in this movie, which may be lost, or at least of small impact on, western audiences.  I'm American and caucasian, but I've always been something of a Japanophile, and prejudice against foreigners and ""mixed-race"" people is something that Japan has had to deal with (as has any society, America certainly being no exception).  Japan has a history, in literature, music, and art, of protest against racism, and Studio Ghibli handles this beautifully and with great subtlety.  Kudos to a fantastic director who has brought us a lovely film that really touches our emotions and beliefs that will stand the test of time (like all Ghibli films will).",1447718400,,1673,4.890070921985815
7275628,4,B00ZAZB4T6,"""When Marnie Was There"" continues the long Studio Ghibli tradition of female leads that truly drive the story, rather than being caricatures or damsels in need of rescue.  If I have any criticism, it is that the story seems a bit compressed in the second half.  That may or may not be the fault of the screenwriters.  I've never read the novel, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of the translation to film.  What I can state is that this film showcases the artistry and attention to detail that Studio Ghibli is justifiably famous for.  It is an interesting story, combined with a nice soundtrack, and great visuals.  One of the most beautifully animated films you will ever see.",1447718400,2,684,4.658333333333333

I hesitated at first partially because it's not a Hayao Miyazaki film but I decided to give it a try since its from Studio Ghibli.

A young girl, Ann is sent to the seashore to help her with her health and anxiety and meets an odd girl named Marnie together Anna starts to become more social and make friends. Its a great story and not what you expect. There are also really cute nods to other works such a a tanuki stature, a mini totoro on the desk, carving of the cat from kiki's delivery service and much more. The Charters are wonderfully designed from both the visual perspective and their completeness which I felt lacked in Tales of Earthsea, and Secret of Arriettie. It reminds me of Howls Moving Castle with the independence and will of the characters. Too bad Disney passed on this one.",1445385600,,822,4.598639455782313
7275652,4,B00ZAZB4T6,"I have recently been trying to gather up all my Studio Ghibli favorites on blu-ray and this gem popped up on my radar. I remember seeing a short trailer for it a while back but I quickly forgot about it. I purchased this film on a whim when it showed up on my recommended items and I was not disappointed.

I thought I might lose interest in the beginning but I ended up really caring about Ana and her quest to find herself. The overall theme can be a bit dark and serious for a kids movie but I think that helps it appeal to an older audience as well. The mystery behind Marnie kept me hooked until the very end. A very family friendly film that children and parents can enjoy together.

The animation was top notch as always. Just what you would expect from Studio Ghibli. The voice acting was great too. I will go back and watch the film in Japanese just because I like that experience but the English adaptation was very enjoyable.

I wouldn't put this in my top 3 Ghibli films but it is one I'm glad to have added to my collection.",1445299200,2,1037,4.201005025125628
7275653,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"I had been curious about this movie for a while as I knew nothing about it or the book it was based on. I must admit it beat my expectations which I set rather high for any Studio Ghibli film. There is so much subtle human emotion that you get lost in the characters.
This isn't a film where magic is a cure all to force a happy ending. Without spoilers, this film gave me mixed feelings as the story unfolded but through out it all, I was left very satisfied. This is a great story and beautiful film to add to your collection.",1445299200,2,528,4.086538461538462

7275655,4,B00ZAZB4T6,"Studio Ghibli continues it's storytelling prowess. Definitely one should pay attention as time, characters and relations are not as simple as what first appears. Animation is good but not great in that in their past endeavors even the backgrounds had that unique individuality and not just still background mattes e.g. clouds, trees, plants moving.

7275659,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"Just finished, along with Jeff H., watching ""When Marnie Was There"" released by Studio Ghibli.
Based on the children's novel written by Joan G. Robinson, ""When Marnie Was There"" is the lushly lyrical story of Anna, a young orphan who lives with her adoptive parents, who feel isolated and alone because she can not form emotional connections with those around her due to the fact that she doesn't feel like a normal person due to her asthma.  She is also a very gifted artist.
When an asthma attack forces her into bed; her adoptive mother and her doctor decide that it would be better for her to spend a few months in the country where the clean air would do her a world of good.
So Anna's ""auntie"" - what she calls her adoptive mother - makes arrangements with her relatives who live in the country, and soon Anna is on a train to meet her cousins.
Once there, Anna is enchanted by the sight of the old abandoned Marsh house. As she draws it, she notices a light in a second story window.  Intrigued, Anna bravely decides to cross the marsh when the tide is low and  investigates.  What she finds is a deserted house, with decades of dust.  She falls asleep and would be stranded at the Marsh house if it wasn't for being rescued by a silent boatman who befriends her.
A few days pass and she returns to the shore to find a rowboat waiting for her.  Hesitant, because she really doesn't know how to row, Anna begins to row for the old Marsh house, where she finds Marnie waiting for her.
Here's where the mystery deepens.  Who is Marnie?  Why is she only around at certain times of the evening and rarely ever, in the day time?  She loves Anna and calls her ""her most perfect friend and secret.""  Marnie also tells Anna that nobody can ever know about their friendship.  [No, it's not a pre-teen LBGT that is unfolding here.]
As Anna seeks to unravel the mystery of who Marnie is; Anna becomes a better individual and is willing to be more open and make friends.  She also accepts that she is loved by her adoptive parents and calls them Mom and Dad.
When Anna does learn who Marnie really is, is perhaps one of the most stunning moments in movie history, because Marnie then becomes Anna's most precious secret and one that she is willing to share.
Studio Ghibli has created a lush and masterful movie that will live on in the hearts and minds of all who see it.  No American studio would have dared to film this movie because they would not have trusted the story to resonate with its audience.  Nor would this movie have worked as a 3-D computer animated movie.
SIMPLY BREATHTAKING!
STUNNING ANIMATION!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

7275669,4,B00ZAZB4T6,"When Marnie Was There does follow some basic patterns that weve grown used to with Ghibli films: A misfit lead must learn to like themselves with the help of friends in a somewhat fantastic setting. But one clear difference from the start is the level and clarity of the main characters unhappiness. While past Ghibli films have featured heroines with low self-esteem, I believe When Marnie Was There goes the furthest in this respect, as with raw emotion Anna cries, I hate myself! Add to this a backdrop more recent and recognizable than many of Ghiblis previous films, which often took place in historical or fantasy settings, and the story hits fairly close to home. Because of this, it packs an emotional punch that Ghiblis beautiful but still somewhat distant fantasy films cant approach.

Almost all of the Ghibli films amble along admirably at their own pace, taking the time to show everyday details in ordinary lives, but Marnie does so in somewhat clumsy mimicry of its predecessors. The film certainly moves slowly, but it doesnt utilize the benefits of its pacing. Sometimes it seems to move slowly simply for the sake of doing so. I was never bored, but the time could have been much better spent on some character and setting development. The fantasy element of the mysterious mansion and Marnie breaks into the movie rather suddenly. I never got a feel for the place or society that Anna lived in throughout the film, nor did I ever get to know any of the characters besides Anna and Marnie. This is something that Ghibli has done before in some of their other more realistic films: The movies can be so focused on the two or three leads, who are usually very well developed, that all the other characters are reduced to comic relief or dull clichs who exist only to fulfill their small (and usually predictable) roles.

The animation seems similar to that of The Wind Rises, but it is even more gorgeous. The music is lovely and well suited to the film, but there isn't anything especially memorable about it except for the credits song, Fine On the Outside by Priscilla Ahn, which is breathtaking.

All in all, while When Marnie Was There has its flaws, it is well worth seeing and certainly deserves its place beside other memorable titles of Studio Ghibli.",1444435200,2,2276,4.742424242424242

There are three trailers before the main menu, one for The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, Song of the Sea and The Box Trolls. Oddly, these cant be skipped with the menu button, but can be skipped with the skip forward/advance button.

The main menu is fairly simple, showcasing stills from the movie using a ""Ken Burns"" type effect with ambient audio from the film. There is a somewhat annoying ""beep"" turned on by default while navigating the menus, but it can be shut off in the ""Setup"" menu.

7275673,5,B00ZAZB4T6,"""When Marnie Was There"" is a bittersweet watch, seeing as how it is rumored to be the last film produced by the acclaimed and legendary Studio Ghibli. This film, however, sets it apart from it's more fantasy-driven films like Spirited Away and even Arriety. The mix of reality and fantasy are well done as it tells the story of Anna, a somewhat reclusive and withdrawn preteen who doesn't feel like she belongs inside the ""magic circle"" that the rest of the world she feels is in. A trip from her home city of Sapporo to the seaside town of Kushiro follows an asthma attack and soon comes across a manor house on the other side of a cove. She meets a mysterious girl named Marnie and the two embark on a close friendship that, through the course of the film, reveals a tragic past.

This film is rich with lush animation and scenery that Ghibli films are known for. The score compliments the film with it's tranquility and beauty. While this film might benefit older viewers and be lost on the younger ones, all in all, this is a film that is a must watch and a must own.  Marnie and Anna's close friendship might be a little odd to some, but it slowly starts making sense eventually as the movie progresses. Seeing as how this may or may not be Ghibli's final swansong, this film could have been a rushed and uninspired film. But it is a beautifully done movie and worthy of praise and a watch!",1444348800,9,1395,4.403100775193798

The animation is exceptional, the voice actor pairings exceptional, and the storyline. Who cannot feel the wonder, but also a look into a past that needs to be done before you can face a life ahead?

The stories of Marnie and Ana are tragic, yet there's a lot of hope and positivity in living your life, and not quitting. I had so many things go through my mind in the story as it played out, and I am rarely shaken emotionally by what I see on screen.

Not sure I can watch it again, no matter how brilliant this film is. But it stays with me, and is one of those timeless films that will teach you a lot about human nature, and your own self.",1535241600,,809,4.2064516129032254

Upon arrival, I immediately noticed that it didn't come with any O card/sleeve (it had been re-shrink wrapped) As I continued to open I had seen the top corner was chipped and excessive scrapes along the entire frame of the case. It became even worse when I discovered smudges all over the DVD disc. I cannot believe that this happened, as I have never had problems with ordering movies from amazon before. Definitely not even worth a one star review. I have filed a replacement and will edit accordingly.
EDIT:  Just opened the package and it has the same issues. Scraped case, no sleeve, beaten up disc. The only thing different was no chipped corner. I am thoroughly disappointed and do not reccomend anyone buy this from amazon. Try Gkids website",1532822400,,844,4.702702702702703
