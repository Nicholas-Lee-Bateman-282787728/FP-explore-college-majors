5026318,5,B006WY0VD4,"This 2 part History/Military Channel documentary on D-Day could easily be overlooked as just another show--but its how its done that makes it so rave worthy to me. In typical History Channel fashion you get a combination of footage from D-Day, combined with interviews from Vets who were there, historians being interviewed adding knowledge and perspective, and reenactments of the scenes using actors. This 'blend' that the History/Military Channels do is a very entertaining but not a process that everyone will enjoy particularly purists who know WWII details better than I. But for me, I find this style of show these channels produce a great way to present history. The scenes with the actors are redundant at times like how they tell you everything you just saw after they come back from each commercial break but that's understandable. Overall, I give this show a '10' and that's from someone with a huge collection of WWII films/docs.",1379980800,5,942,5.044871794871795
5026319,5,B006WY0VD4,"This video tells the often missed story of how a navy destroyer, USS Frankford, moving in to only 800 yards off Omaha Beach, saved the invasion on D-Day. On the brink of accepting defeat and withdrawing, this action turned defeat into victory. You can see the gratitude in the faces of the Army soliders who were on the beach as it happened during their interviews.

Also there is rare Navy color film (the Army used black and white film, the Navy used color) of the Frankford shelling Omaha Beach. You can also see my cousin's LST-533 dropping anchor on Omaha Beach later that day. His sister found out where he had been, when it and the other LSTs showed up in a famous photo of Omaha Beach on the front page of the New York Times. With wartime censorship, she had no idea what he had been doing!

This is an important historical document of the larges invasion in human history.",1346716800,7,881,4.46583850931677
