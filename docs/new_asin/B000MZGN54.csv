2752325,4,B000MZGN54,"This video is very informative, and I would recommend it to those who are interested in the history of one of the landmark discoveries of the last three generations.  I did not know anything about x-ray crystallography, and this inspired me to read up on it.  In view of James Watson's recent comments, maybe Rosalind Franklin does need some post-mortem defenders...but this video comes off in the vein of ""those mean men!  They were too stupid to develop their own theory, so they had to climb over a woman to come up with anything meaningful!"".  Power to Rosalind...may she receive the credit she deserves, but don't make her a victim!",1194998400,12,637,4.763636363636364
2752326,5,B000MZGN54,"Male scientists steal a female scientist's DNA work.  They call her diminutives behind her back.  They portray her as a shrew in their biographical book.  They act as if she were a trivial part of their publications.  Still, they win Nobel Prizes and she dies before the age of 40.  In the same way that my pro-feminist sensibilities made it difficult to watch the film ""North Country,"" it was very painful to watch the oppression described in this documentary.

This is very important for all female scientists to see.  Like the Curies, R. Franklin's research may have played a role in her death.  Though non-religious, R. Franklin was a Jewish woman and there is a Hebrew phrase written on her gravesite.  Perhaps, she can be deemed an important figure in Jewish women's history texts and lists.  I really hope that feminists, in Britain and across the globe, can organize to get Dr. Franklin a posthumous Nobel.

The work has female and male interviewees.  The work conspicuously states that Sigourney Weaver narrates.  Though her voice is recognizable, I didn't feel that Lt. Ellen Ripley was speaking to me as the actress told the facts.

Scientists often imply that they are beyond oppression and interpersonal matters.  However, the history of science is marked with much sexism, racism, and other prejudices.  This is one glaring example of that, but the word sexism is never used, surprisingly.",1181606400,10,1403,4.957081545064377

2752328,4,B000MZGN54,"This is a very interesting portrayal of the DNA discovery saga.

Having read the Double Helix many years ago it was most informative to see another side to the story.

2752329,5,B000MZGN54,"I liked to show Race for the Double Helix in my bio classes but since my copy is not any good any more, I decided on this movie.  I really enjoyed the background.  It is more a biography of Rosalind Franklin and I don't think you find too many documentaries of women's contributions.  This was refreshing.",1394928000,3,305,4.410714285714286

2752331,4,B000MZGN54,"I knew about Rosalind Franklin's work on DNA from an old BBC/Horizon drama program (""The Race for the Double Helix"" -- which I wish they would issue on DVD).  This NOVA program gives a straight up report about her work in parallel with that of Crick and Watson as well as the gender bias prevalent at the time. But this is not a feministic polemic.  Franklin died young, and mostly unknown because she died before her colleagues were awarded the Nobel - and at the time there were no posthumous award recipients.  For those interested in scientific history, this is a nice addition to a library.",1392422400,2,595,4.59433962264151

2752333,2,B000MZGN54,"Photo 51 is the name given an X-ray image of DNA taken by Raymond Gosling in the 1952 lab of Rosalind Franklin while her PhD student. The photo was key to identifying the structure of DNA. Later James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins (the individual who showed the photo to Watson) received the 1962 Nobel prize in Medicine. While there's obviously something fishy/underhanded about the whole process, whether Franklin would have determined DNA's structure on her own from this photo is speculative.

Bottom-Line: The topic of this DVD is not educational, nor is it interesting.",1375747200,2,588,5.125
2752334,5,B000MZGN54,"This NOVA documentary about the ""real"" story of how the structure of DNA was deduced is great! It's interesting how many biology textbooks portrayed Rosalind Franklin as a willingly advisor to James Watson and Francis Crick in their quest to uncover the molecular structure of DNA. I would definitely show this documentary to biology students so that way they can acquire the nonfictional story of Rosalind Franklin's contribution to the discovery of DNA.",1362268800,6,455,5.2465753424657535
2752335,5,B000MZGN54,"I had been looking for a copy of the PBS documentary series 'Race for the Double Helix', which apparently is fairly rare and very pricey, albeit the series is a story-line type of production. This NOVA production is pure documentary, about an hour long, and very well constructed. It not only tells the essential story of the discovery of the DNA structure, but deals with the history of Rosalind Franklin, her relationships and perception by other scientists and collaborators, and ultimately with the controversy around her contributions to the DNA-structure discovery. At the end, I found the story had passed quickly, it was never boring. Highly recommended for anyone interested not only in the science involved, but the history of scientific discovery and the contributions of a lesser-known but significant scientist.",1361491200,4,824,5.297709923664122

2752339,5,B000MZGN54,Rosalind Franklin was not only a remarkable woman but an outstanding scientist as well.  It was this photo that sealed the deal as far as the discovery of DNA.

2752340,5,B000MZGN54,"Dr. Rosalind Franklin, a determined researcher specializing in the x-ray analysis of chrystaline structures. Her work on DNA took place in the early 1950s when there were few women scientists. Franklin found herself in an uncomfortable work environment with other scientists in the ""old boy network."" James Watson and Francis Crick, gaining access to a key piece of her research (Photo 51), managed to solve the puzzle of the shape and nature of DNA's structure.

This DVD discusses the poor treatement of Franklin in Watson's later memoir and the fact that she was not mentioned when Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins (Franklin's coworker) accepted the Nobel prize for their work on DNA. This documentary tries to do justice to a great scientist who never realized how much she had contributed to the quest to learn the secrets of life itself.",1325203200,,844,5.0285714285714285
2752341,5,B000MZGN54,"This is a very good presentation and a good revision of the presentation of Rosalind Franklin's importance and character; it is particularly important given the way she is presented in James Watson's Double Helix.

That said, I don't know if we need to portray Watson as a ""villain"", which almost seems to be the objective of this video at times. Watson and Crick had access to Ms. Franklin's data without her knowing but that is not the same as saying Watson and Crick were plagarists (which almost seems to be the take-home message some Amazon reviewers have been left with).

Had Ms. Franklin published Photo 51 in a journal, perhaps some other chemist (such as Mr. Pauling in the states) might have figured out the chemical structure first. In that sense, all the ""naughty"" behaviour might be partly seen as an attempt to be sure that a british lab got the credit not an american one. It is certainly very unjust that Ms. Franklin did not get proper credit or that she was portrayed as she was by Watson in his book the Double Helix.

It is not the first or last time that everyone who made a key contribution to a discovery did not receive proper credit. It is also fair to suggest that Watson's book is shown to be in even worse taste than one might have thought. The desire to portray Mr. Watson as a villain seems out of place and may stem from the same desire for a simplistic narrative which may have motivated Mr Watson to write the story as he did in the first place.",1319500800,3,1479,4.450184501845018
2752342,5,B000MZGN54,"As my moniker suggests I am a scientist and specifically work with DNA and pharmacology. This is a story that puts me in a tailspin - Rosalind Franklin discovered the structure of life. Three scientists, unbeknownst to her, used her data and discoveries, published their work, gave her no credit - and then used this (her) work to go on and win the Nobel prize! If there ever is a time when the world needs to ask the Nobel committee to rescind the prize it is now. Bottom line, Photo 51 was the basis of everything - all the modeling, the antiparallel strands, the base pairing predictions, the 10 base pairs per turn. Without Roaslind's work there was no data/ modeling/ predictions of structure and no Nobel prize for Watson, Crick & Maurice

Shame on you Watson & Crick!

2752343,5,B000MZGN54,"I'm a biology professor, and I love showing this DVD to my classes, to let them know that all the glory does NOT go to Watson and Crick for 'discovering' DNA, and that they actually stole a vital piece of data from a fellow scientist!  It's also great for showing the importance of womens' contributions to the field of science, and how these early female scientists helped pave the way for women in science today.",1259020800,22,414,4.52

2752345,4,B000MZGN54,"A good contribution to Franklin's role in this important discovery, a discovery that unleashed molecular genetics. It's too bad that Watson did not respond to Nova's request for an interview (as claimed in the piece). Watson's ""The Structure of DNA"" was never presented as a history -- it was a personal memoir, filled with impolitic observations that stunned Crick and others involved in the ""race."" In some ways, Watson has done a service to Franklin, portraying her in such an unflattering and ungenerous way that legions have been motivated to provide a corrective view. Some good objective histories, such as Olby's, provide a bit more balanced assessment. I did not see reference to Sayre's biography of Franklin, which is a good read.",1237766400,17,741,5.081967213114754
2752346,5,B000MZGN54,"This is a very revealing story into the discovery of DNA's structure, and the immensely important role that Rosalind Franklin had.  I wouldn't say the movie necessarily victimized her as much as Watson villainized her in his book, ""The Double Helix.""
I'd highly recommend this for anyone interested in biology.

8173647,4,B000MZGN54,"I have long admired Rosalind Franklin.  This Nova episode gives an overview of her brilliant and much too short life as well as a rather evenhanded look at the controversy that forms the title.  The ""old boys club"" was at work, yet Franklin pursued her research with single-minded diligence.  That watching this doesn't leave the viewer looking to post the head of James Watson on a pike shows just how evenhandedly it deals with his malevolence and deceit.  Rosalind Franklin belongs on short-list of great scientists of the 20th century.  That most people have never heard of her is a big reason why this DVD is so important.",1514937600,,627,4.768518518518518
8173648,5,B000MZGN54,"Great scientific discoveries are never made by people thinking about reality in a room. That practice is called Philosophy  a study which has not contributed to mankinds understanding of the universe for the last 3,000 years (e.g. see, Physics, by Aristotle [objects fall at a rate proportional to their weight]). Scientific inquiry requires data, observation, and experimentation. Even Einstein was only able to develop Relativity Theory after the speed of light was accurately measured and it became known that the movement of atomic particles do not obey Newtons laws of motion.

For this reason, when we read James Watsons account of the discovery of the DNA helix we should immediately become suspicious. What experiments had he performed in order to understand DNAs structure? What data had he gathered? Where were his calculations?

Indeed, Watson and Cricks discovery is one of the great hoaxes of history. Their role in unraveling the DNA helix was extremely small. It was akin to providing a copy of King Lear to an illustrator, and when the illustrator had finished his drawings, proclaiming them a brilliant, original work of literature.

Lets face it, Watson and Cricks first model, which they had developed by thinking about the DNA molecule, was incorrect. So was the three strand model developed by the great Linus Pauling, who published before Watson and Crick. Pauling too, had only thought about the molecule. It was Rosalind Franklin, Watson and Cricks colleague at Kings College, who told them that it was, and why it was, WRONG! Franklin knew because she had already accumulated the necessary experimental data to determine DNAs true structure. However, being the meticulous researcher that she was, Franklin continued gathering ever clearer x-ray photos and performing more precise calculations, by hand, of her data. Franklins lab notebooks clearly demonstrate that she had already worked out the helical arrangement of the atoms and the proper placement of the nucleic acids and phosphate molecules (see, NOVA, The Secret of Photo 51, Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA) before Watson and Crick developed their model.

So, you may say, Watson and Crick beat Franklin to the publisher. Theres the rub, they hadnt at all. As I said earlier, it should raise questions that Watson and Crick had not conducted a single experiment. Their claim to fame rests solely upon that fateful day when they, with the assistance of a bitter and resentful Maurice Wilkins, stole Rosalind Franklins data. Earlier, John Randell, the director of the Kings College lab, had placed Franklin in charge of Wilkins igniting a sharp feud between the two individuals. Later, without her knowledge or consent, Wilkins gave Franklins findings to Watson and Crick. Only then, armed with Franklins data, and in particular photo 51, were Watson and Crick able to assemble the correct model. Worse still, is that neither man had the integrity to credit Franklins work as the source upon which their model was derived. They made it appear as if they had constructed it out of thin air.

The proper order of history, then, is that Rosalind Franklin discovered the structure and nature of the DNA molecule and, later, Watson and Crick, using her data, had developed a model of the molecule. You can decide for yourself whose achievement was greater. If you're wondering why Franklin did not receive the Nobel Prize, she died in 1958 and the Nobel rules prohibit posthumous awards.

Watsons attempt to influence history in his book is shameful. It is important to note that every person who was present in Cambridge at that time, including Francis Crick, objected to Watsons account. When Harvard University Press demanded changes, Watson refused and sought another publisher.
In the book, Watson takes every opportunity to belittle Franklin. He refers to her by a derisive nickname rather than by her proper name. He portrays Franklin as a shrewish woman while failing to mention the distinctly anti-feminine atmosphere prevailing at Kings College (woman had to congregate in separate rooms from men). He describes Franklin as hording her data and why wouldnt she protect it from parasites like Watson and Crick. Watson even mocks Franklins appearance and clothing. Of course he does! Because James Watson needed to hide the shameful fact that he had discovered nothing. His model was completely dependent upon Franklins work.

Rosalind Franklin was by far the greater scientist. She was brilliant, articulate, witty, and cultured. In her brief 16 year career, she made many contributions to science. She participated in humanitarian work and was also an avid outdoors enthusiast hiking throughout the Alps with her family and friends. Had she lived longer, Franklin may have brought the World closer to an understanding of cancer and may have even become a staunch environmentalist. Franklin was named by the BBC as one of the top 100 female scientists of the 20th century.

As for her appearance, Google her name and see for yourself. Franklin was stunningly beautiful. Imagine that: beauty and brains all in one individual. Meanwhile, Watson was a homely dude and it is well known that he was an avowed skirt chaser. This is understandable since most homely men seek reaffirmation through recognition by attractive women. It would not be surprising to learn that Watson had made some crude or vulgar advances towards Franklin which were quickly rebuffed by her extremely sharp tongue.

History has been kinder to Francis Crick. He was the more humble individual. Nevertheless, he was complicit in hiding how dependent his work was upon Franklins. For that reason he shares the blame.
Watson went on to proclaim racist views. He openly stated that people of African descent had biologically inferior intellects (and just you wait, were going to find a gene to prove it . . . someday . . . soon . . . really soon). ""All our social policies, he wrote, are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours  whereas all the testing says not really."" He went on to write that African Americans should not be treated as equals because ""People who have to deal with black employees find this not true.""

Apparently, Watson never met Katherine Johnson, the brilliant African American female who was solving quadratic equations in sixth grade and later graduated summa cum laude in mathematics and physics. When the hit movie ($241 million in box office sales) made her achievements known, Americans were left wondering how many other brilliant African Americans had toiled away in obscurity while whites were given the credit.

Later, Watson was thrown off the Boards of every corporation on which he sat and was forced to resign as director of Cold Spring Labs. He tried to auction off his Noble Medal to raise money for his living expenses but by then, nobody cared (he also wanted to use the money to buy an expensive painting  poor fellow). Watsons statements show just how shallow his intellect really was.

Nova has done a commendable job of bringing to light Franklin's crucial role in the discovery of the DNA double helix. This documentary combined with ""Rosalind Franklin"": The Dark Lady of DNA"" correct the long-held view that Watson and Crick had developed the DNA model. One can only hope that over time, Franklin's role will overshadow that of her colleagues and that she will be awarded her proper place as one of the greatest minds in science.",1500508800,,7459,5.057770545158665
