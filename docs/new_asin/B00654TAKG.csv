8493282,3,B00654TAKG,"This was a ""good"" attempt at telling the story of a Sniper Competition, but good only goes so far.  I would have really liked to see more time devoted to the teams.  Instead the viewer is treated to a jumble of rapid shifts from team to team apparently to add ""drama"" to the competition.  Do I know how to make a good film about this type of competition?  No.  I do know what I like to see, and there was just not enough of it in this video.",1403222400,,441,3.965909090909091
8493283,5,B00654TAKG,"This is a good documentary DVD, On how sniper competition is done. Very interesting to see what kind of things they do in competition.",1397520000,,134,4.625
8493284,4,B00654TAKG,"Several years ago, I bought the 4 episodes of ""Top Sniper"" made available on iTunes. That series was produced by the Military Channel and contained just under 3 hours of content. This is the International Sniper Competition from 2009 (the iTunes series was from 2008) and although some would think it outdated, it's more contemporary than you might think. They also change the competition every year, adding and subtracting events, as well as bringing in new competitors. My greatest disappointment with this DVD is that it is marketed as containing 173 minutes of footage when in fact it really doesn't. The feature of the DVD is approximately two hours, NOT three. About one hour of the quoted feature time is the ""International"" version of the documentary which is just an abbreviated version of the feature, NOT new content. The feature has a female narrator who sounds British and contains a lot of the same Audio Network music used in the Magpul Dynamics productions (Art of the Dynamic...). Overall, it's a good purchase for $10.",1379548800,,1036,4.959770114942529
8493285,5,B00654TAKG,"My boyfriend loves military documentaries and shows about guns and shooting so I got him Sniper Comp for his birthday.  We watched it that week and surprisingly I was very entertained and could not stop watching it.  I don't shoot guns or anything, but this video is really exciting.  It features the top snipers from all over the world to compete in combat-like situations.  It's almost like an action movie, but very real.  Of course he loved the video and watched it at least 4 times already, always pausing and taking notes because he likes recreational shooting.  The price also worked out very well for the amount of content and quality.  It's not some hokey shooting show with cheesey graphics and some actors trying to be tough.  This is the real deal.",1335571200,2,760,4.704545454545454
8493286,3,B00654TAKG,"This production is very well made and does give us a behinds the scene look at the Sniper Comp. I was, however, left wanting more. I am, like many who will be interested in this documentary, a shooting nerd and was left wanting in regards to information relating to the equipment being used and the sniper's thoughts on their particular weapon system. Perhaps this is asking too much as I'm not sure how free the producers were with access to this kind of detail or the snipers to talk about such things. Never the less I happily watched it all and enjoyed every minute.",1334880000,2,570,4.490384615384615
8493287,5,B00654TAKG,"Sniper Comp is a very good value. The DVD production is clean and filmed professionally, video and sound are excellent. The content is factual and accurate with no nonsense. As a varmint hunter and armchair sniper I am impressed to see that the aspects of varmint hunting that I struggle with are the very same aspects that professional Snipers struggle with. And that is accurate ranging and reading the wind over long distances. Now granted the gophers (Richardson Ground Squirrel) that I shoot usually stand around and discuss what that buzzing sound of my first misplaced shot was. So unlike Snipers I do get the luxury of a ""do over"". Sniper Comp is an excellent video for anyone involved in the shooting sports. Or for anyone curious as to what Snipers really do and what their world is like. Highly recommended.",1334016000,,818,4.808510638297872
8493288,5,B00654TAKG,"Nice shot video, great shooting excercises are shown, lot of different rifles used by the participant, no longer only Rem 700 type of rifles that compete, but types like AI and Ashbury finnaly come more in to play in this competition. Quality is excelent.",1333152000,,255,4.818181818181818
8493289,5,B00654TAKG,"I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend and he LOVED it! Kind of feels like you're riding shotgun in the tank with snipers or right over their shoulder as they're pulling the trigger--really great coverage and excellent documentary overall! He loved Eye of the Sniper and watches the Military Channel like it's his job, so this was a must-own for his DVD collection.

Water cooler points:
-9th Annual International Sniper Competition
-32 teams
-Covers 18 events over 7 days (my favorite was the night vision part, if you watch you'll know why!)
-Military and Law Enforcement teams compete, as well as international teams (England, Ireland, Spain)
-There are two versions within the DVD--one regular, one international (shorter)
-Profits go to fallen warrior funds (Army/Marines)

Hope this helps if you're on the fence!",1329436800,,819,5.104477611940299
8493290,5,B00654TAKG,"I loved the Military Channel series Top Sniper and was really bummed when it ended.  It looks like the producers of the series have decided to continue to make the show and I couldn't be more thrilled.  This DVD picks up where the series left off and really takes you behind the scope with the snipers as they compete in this amazing competition.  With teams from all over the world, there are a vast assortment of incredibly cool weapons, and you really get an inside look at what sniping is like today in modern warfare.  There are also some really cool shots of bullets in flight that allow you to follow the action like watching a football game and see the bullets fly into the targets like a pass into a receiver's chest.

Overall this is an excellent DVD and I really hope they do another one.  I can't get enough of this stuff.  If you love guns, sniping, or just hard core competition, I highly recommend this DVD.",1327276800,5,922,4.420118343195266
