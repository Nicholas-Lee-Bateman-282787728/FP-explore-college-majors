8059780,3,B0009ETD28,"I'd like to say right away - this edition is solely for the fans. If Synapse films wanted to make one for a wider audience they'd include ""The Ring"", ""Grudge"", ""One Missed Call"" and ""Dark Water"" in the box. So if you've seen any of these movies and now want to get to know japanise horror better, look for some other films. This edition is for connoisseurs, for those who've seen many and who want these not so well known flicks for their collection. I'm not one of them but I still bought it because there were no one to warn me :)
So what we have here are four movies:

ORGAN - a surrealistic and crazy picture, reminding flicks like ""Tetsuo"", about a criminal syndicate which takes organs of living persons for a further selling for transplantation. A real cult film in Japan and among aficionados, but I was disappointed - it's very hard to understand anything of the plot at the first time, and I'm not sure I'll have a desire to watch it for the second time.

ENTRAILS OF A VIRGIN and ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN - two flicks of a cult director Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu who's making exploitative trash mainly. And these two are very much alike. Together they last about two and a half hours and I'm pretty sure two hours of this time is given away for explicit sex scenes, which are rather funny though. The rest of the time is dedicated to grisly murders and monsters with huge penises. I doubt watching these films will add something to your life experience but if you like this kind of cinema, you'll get a lot of pleasure.

EVIL DEAD TRAP - the only worthy film in this collection to my opinion. The difference is it's not pure trash like other three, it's a real japanise horror of good quality. Not of any resemblance with recent japanise flicks but it definately has its own style and apparently made under the influence of italian filmmakers like Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. Talking about the story line I can only say it reminded me of a movie ""Fear dot com"" but obviously better, don't make up you mind on it!

I didn't quite get the Synapse films' strategy - all films are not like each other except ""Entrails..."" dilogy, but if you are completing a set of movies with four different flicks, why don't take some other instead of one of the ""Entrails""? Again there are three schlock-films here with one which is rather good. Why don't include some forth trash piece instead of ""Evil Dead Trap""? Therefore it seemed to me the box is a bit clueless and confused.
So if you want some decent japanise horror flicks, just buy ""Evil Dead Trap"" separately. And if you wanted all of these four films anyway, buy the box - it will cost you about $20 less than buying them all separately. By the way I bought it at Amazon when they had their prices reduction and the box costed me $38. Maybe you'll want to wait till their next special deal on this set.
P.S. All four films are exactly the same editions that are sold separately.",1132531200,32,2936,4.431481481481481
