3722750,5,B001NQ4UL0,"This movie's first 2 dvds (14 episodes) goes a little bit off tangent from its original, I might say it is quiet boring because they are trying to picture the relationship between Yang Kang with his father. However, starting episode 15 up to 50, this version is THE BEST OF THE BEST!!! The way they depict every character is very very superb although they can throw away some of the 'drama' scenes (I think there are too many unnecessary drama scenes). Nonetheless, this version is excellent and I would recommend to every Condor Hero's fans to watch it.",1290988800,7,554,4.663265306122449

3722752,5,B001NQ4UL0,"Those unfamiliar with the now classic Wuxia story of the ""Hawk Shooting Heroes,"" should understand that this is part of a trilogy by the renowned Wuxia author Louis Cha, known better by the pen name Jin Yong.  This series is the first part of the trilogy and is a prequel to the second part ""Return of the Condor Heroes,"" with the third installment, ""Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber,"" being more independent from the first two parts.  Because of the popularity of this story, it has been made many times in both film and television, this being the most recent adaptation of the novel.  But as with most translations into the screen, there will almost always be changes in story, in both additions and cuts from the original plot.

For those new to Wuxia should understand that it is usually a well balanced mix of several genres; fantasy, romance, comedy, action and drama, all packaged together with a strong martial arts base, supporting into the story.  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" being the most widely known example of Wuxia to western audiences.  The stories usually carry many plotlines and characters connected through this world.  Due to the scale of development in the characters, my opinion is that you cannot fully grasp the stories in a film due to time restraints.  In effect, television is by far the best visual media to capture the essence of these stories and the television shows produced are more faithful to the original storylines of the books, as this version does as well.

While I feel that ""The Legend of the Condor Heroes"" is somewhat the epitome of Wuxia, having many well developed characters and storylines, within those many, I think the very heart of this series is the focused relationship between the characters Guo Jing and Huang Rong.  In this aspect, this version of the series is the best in my opinion.  Re-teaming from a previous series, ""The Little Fairy"" (2006), Hu Ge and Ariel Lin's onscreen chemistry anchors the whole series and I believe is the best actors to have tackled these much played roles.  While there will always be debate on which series is the best, some thinking that the 2003 version of ""Legend of the Condor Heroes"" is better than this installment (or even the much older versions), I feel that the lead roles in this version are without a doubt superior.  Ariel Lin pulls a very remarkable representation of Rong, intelligent and mischievously cute; while Hu Ge fully embodies the nave innocence and humble growth to maturity that is the heart of Jing's personality.  Their efforts alone as actors would be greatly respected, but the main reason for my opinion is the connection between the two characters that is so vital to the storyline.  This is pulled off with superb grace by both Hu Ge and Ariel Lin.  Here, we see that opposites do attract and it is the bond they show so naturally and whole-heartily to prove this, as they balance each other and work off their strengths to cover the other's weaknesses.  And while personally, I'm not an individual that believes in ""true love,"" watching these two characters makes me want to believe there is.

With that being said, even without the lead roles, I feel that the acting in this version is the strength of this series.  As the dreams and demons of the characters play such an important part of the story, this elevates this series among it's counterparts in terms of the emotional aspect within the story.  The characters are shaped and understood, rather than having to speculate their origins in their motives, also adding to the authenticity of their actions.

Among the negative aspects in this series is the usage of CG.  Although the effects within the martial arts fights does add to the scenes most of the time, I felt that the CG usage for the animals was pretty bad.  Most of the animals that appear in the story are all computerized and very outdated-looking.  Condors, snakes, and sparrows all looked better fitted for cartoons rather than a live action show.  As I watched the series however, it did not bother me so much.  If you don't take it too seriously, it even gives you a chuckle now and then.  But I do wish they would have just opted to not use CG's for the animals and just used the real thing.  Also CG backgrounds were very poorly executed and is extremely unnatural in appearance.  As you watch more Chinese or Hong Kong produced Wuxia however, it isn't something out of the ordinary.  Still, it seems out of place,  sometimes distracting, and something I wish they would have avoided.  As far as the CG in the fights themselves though, I enjoyed these.  Many of the stances contained CG and all added to the visual presentation.  In moderation, it is very effective, like the wine used in one of the beginning fights scenes between Qiu Chuji and the Seven Freaks.

I think that the theme of love defines this series.  Above all the themes of loyalty, revenge, redemption, and morality, it is love that leaves the biggest impression to the viewers.  Whether you have seen Wuxia before or are new to the genre.  Or are well familiar with this trilogy and the many characters that represent it.  The common themes will still relate to just about any viewer.  And while many of the fantasy elements are things that do not exist in the real world, the lessons and messages are all things that we can learn from and enjoy.",1248998400,18,5367,4.710610932475884

8327778,5,B001NQ4UL0,"This is one of the first series I watched on the net.  It's well cast and well acted.  It has flaws in the makeup department that can be distracting for those who dwell on those things.  In addition, the subs have a few spelling and grammar errors.

I also was happy to see one of my most favorite actors in this movie which is ""LEUNG KAR YAN"", a very exceptional actor. It was just a more adequate version then the other one i have. It's also nice to see two different sides to one thought. I have both versions and this one is by far the best.(TWO THUMBS UP)",1347753600,,414,4.1234567901234565
8327782,4,B001NQ4UL0,"There have been a few TV and movie adaptations of this Luis Cha Jin Yong classic set in the Song Dynasty, a turbulent period dat sees the further decline of China, and the rise of Genghis Khan.

My favorite Tv adaptation is by Shaw Bro TV Station TVB in the mid 1980s which I feel sticks closer to the classic novel series.

China Television did a pretty good adaptation in early 2000 but this joint China Taiwan production does rather well and tries to flesh out the characters more of the major protagonists namely, Guo Jin, Huang Rong and Yang Kang , the heroes and villain of this Jing Yong historical fiction masterpiece.

Also the choice of actors was great and the cast gave it their best. It was wonderful to see my favorite old skool kungfu action star Beardy Leung Kar Yen (the bridgadier) as the Beggar Clan chief Hung Chi Gung, who imparts his special kungfu - 18 Dragon Palm to our young hero Guo Jin played by China Tv star Hu Ge.

Ariel Lin was born to play the part of the heroine Huang Rong and I enjoyed the action choreography even though I would have preferred it if the director had toned down on the CGI effects which was pretty poor, at best, for such a glitzy production.

I thought the drama scenes were mostly great but not at the expense of what I felt were important parts of the classic story dat was glossed over or heavily summarised dat may make the background story regarding our hero and villain's parents alittle confusing (or not as interesting) at the beginning for a viewer who has never read or watched previous adaptations of this classic.

Also, I didn't quite like the way some of the major events were altered especially towards the end dat would put this adaptation out of sinc with existing TV adapations of the sequel.

If the production managers had followed the classic novel more closely but including those extra drama scenes dat flesh out the characters more, I would have considered this adaptation the best of the best and given it 5 stars instead of 4.

I do hope Tai Seng Video would also release the China 2000 adaptation, wif Cantonese dubbing and English subtitles.

A gripe regarding this dvd release is Tai Seng squeezing over 50 episodes into 7 dvds which must surely affect picture quality. I prefer the TS dvd Singapore release
which has all the episodes covered in 16 dvds. The latter has better picture and sound quality and gives the viewer a choice of mandarin or cantonese audio with surprisingly good english subtitles.

For those who would like to see what I consider to be the best adaptation of this classic on dvd, 'The Condor Hero' by TVB is on limited release (remastered and fully restored with good english subtitles) and maybe ordered either through the Amazon market place or YesAsia Global.",1339977600,,2770,4.600405679513185
8327783,5,B001NQ4UL0,"This version is without a doubt a better movie than """"Legend Of The Condor Heroes"". The actors, fight choreography, story line and visual effects is superb. Some of the actors were in ""The Young Warriors"" which was an excellent movie as well. Hu Ge played a very good role as ""Jing"" compared to the Jing in Legend Of The Condor Heroes which I thought was too much of a wimp.",1323388800,,374,4.357142857142857
