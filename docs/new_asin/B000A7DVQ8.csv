8075458,5,B000A7DVQ8,"This show is really good.  I'm glad I got it, because in Australia, we don't get good shows like this, so I'd already read about it and seen clips of it while in the States and just from those few glimpses, I took a risk and got it.  I like it a lot.  It's focusing more on the doctors who perform the various procedures and the impact it has on their family life in everyway - whether it be their family time suffering, or the riches they can afford.  It also shows the patients who give a little bit of background into their decisions for surgery, but not in the corny narrated way that Extreme Makeover does.  As well as all of this, there are gorgeous shots of Beverly Hills and it's not hard to see why people there are so bent on perfection.  I recommend this to people who like this type of show (plastic surgery) but are sick of the repitition that Extreme Makeover suffers from.",1131753600,12,887,4.25
8075459,5,B000A7DVQ8,Dr. 90210 is a great show. I like it a lot. Can't wait for Gastineau Girls on DVD.,1128556800,3,82,3.611111111111111
8075460,4,B000A7DVQ8,"Dr. Rey is a really cool guy. He cares so much about his patients and seeing him change their lives is incredible. He puts his best efforts into everything he does, which is what has made him the most in-demand plastic surgeon in the world today. He truly is a great doctor, because he even refuses people whom don't need surgery, but are just to vain. He loves to help people and hes a great person.

Who cares if the footage is edited. I'm sure a lot of his customers would prefer not having their nude bodies exposed for the entire nation to see. The special features are cool. The ""gag-real"" with the season's lighter moments are cool and the bonus features really give you an insight into who Dr. Rey really is. The E! Network truly is the leading force in reality tv today and this DVD collection is a great example of it.",1128556800,7,828,4.341935483870968
8075461,1,B000A7DVQ8,"Dont be suprised if this dvd is familiar.  its the same show you saw on E!.  Dont expect ANYTHING extra.  The dvd is edited just like the show, you don't see anything.  Dont expect to see the real footage of the show.  LAME LAME LAME

  * Never-before-seen Footage  --  BIG DEAL

  * Lighter moments and outtakes  --  WHO CARES",1128556800,37,327,4.305084745762712
