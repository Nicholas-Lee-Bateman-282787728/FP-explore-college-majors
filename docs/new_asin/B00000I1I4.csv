1218622,5,B00000I1I4,"I have never before seen a film like this.  You see what war photographer James Nachtwey sees as he holds his camera to his eye thanks to a tiny movie camera mounted on his Canon SLR.  And he really gets into the action of the wars he covers.  Yet he stays calm because he has an important message to deliver to people in world more focused on celebrities than the huge of amount of suffering he sees.
You also see Nachtwey described by others including Christiane Amanpour of CNN.  Amanpour is a seasoned journalist who finds Nachtwey's cool demeanor in the face of war an enigma. He is also described by German photo editors and his best friend.  You also see Nachtwey collaborate with his printer.
Nachtwey challenges us to face these horrors and do something about them.  He asks ""if we don't who will?""  A good question.
This DVD really made me think and I learned a lot about how one of the world's great photographers works.  There is also a seperate interview with Nachtwey which is interesting.
Finally, Nachtwey's book Inferno is back in print and available on Amazon.com.  When it was out of print it sold at a big premium to what it costs now.  It is a stunningly marvelous and poignant collection of photos.  I suggest you get it while you can.  They are hard to view but great for promoting the cause of humanity.",1071273600,9,1327,4.506276150627615
1218623,5,B00000I1I4,"James Nachtwey is a great human being. Committed to war photography for over 20 years, he proves in this film that the power of empathy is stronger than the power of cynicism. Still able to photograph with compassion and unobtrusiveness, after all those years witnessing misery and evil close up, demands respect.
When I first saw Mr. Nachtwey in flesh and blood, at a slide presentation at UC Berkeley in 2000, the thing that struck me immediately was his soft tone and his sparse comments about his photographs. I guess this was not your typical stereotype of a hardened, irritable and egoistic war photographer. It became obvious to me that Mr. Nachtwey is a man of extraordinary principle, courage and sheer force of will. His photographs speaks a thousand times louder than any political declaration.
Photography is potentially a universal language that trancends cultural barriers. Mr. Nachtwey's photographs of a mob killing a man right in front of his eyes in, despite pleading them desperatly to stop, communicates an universal message. It says: ""The world is watching"" and ""I will not allow myself to be intimidated by murderers"". Only an immense moral conviction can create such images, and James Nachtwey has got it.
This kind of photography is difficult. James Nachtwey is one of the few photographers who are able to grab people by instinct rather by intellect. In the film, Nachtwey talks about ""the discipline of the frame"". In order to make good photographs one always have to take into account their compositions. What makes James Nachtwey stand out is his continually well composed war photographs. Remember, this is not fashion shots, where you have endless time to arrange and compose your frame. Mr. Nachtwey's photographs are taken with pinpoint accuracy and calmness in extreme hostile circumstances. For me, this is where the humanity of Mr. Nachtwey reveals itself. Despite chaos around him, he is committed, no matter what, to document with critical distance. People who view these photographs can immediately see what the photographer is trying to tell. In Nachtwey's case he often tells a story of indescribable suffering and destruction. His war photographs, whose esthetic beauty is meant to strengthen the impact of the image, strongly communicates defiance in face of evil and a willingness to record this evil for others to see.
For aspiring documentary photographers as myself, James Nachtwey is a beacon of hope on behalf of the ""concerned photography tradition"". But as Mr. Nachtwey himself mentioned in the film, fewer avenues are open today for documentary photographers. Time pressure from magazines and picture editors make it more difficult to take pictures that demands research and thorough preparation. The committed documentary photographers best bet in the future, possibly, is to become member of a small group of freelance photographers. Recently James Nachtwey quit from the prestigious Magnum Agency and became instead a member of VII, an agency run by photographers for photographers (originally 7 members).
Finally, I want to share some information of where people can get hold of more James Nachtwey material. Of websites, I recommend [...] for its extensive galleries, [...] for whom Mr. Nachtwey is a contract photographer, and [...] with audio interviews of Mr. Nachtwey and photographs from the World Trade Center attacks, 9/11. Of books, I recommend ""Inferno"", for black and white photographs, and ""Magnum Degrees"", for color, both readily availible at www.amazon.com.",1066435200,88,3527,5.266429840142096

Generally his work avoids the bloody violence and carnage war inevitably creates, and pulls the viewers focus instead to the grief and violence that exists with the real people living lives along side the horrific violence of war.  He captures the pathos and grief with uncommon Grace. Part of this documentary introduces the viewer to the real ""Wellcome to Sarajevo"", which I found particularly interesting.  If you are a person who is interested in what can be created or exists in the environment of war, this is your movie.

James Nachtwey is not a sensationalist. His warm embracing of the people he is photographing is exceptional. His willingness to let his camera be the eyes of the people is profound.

I struggled quite a bit trying to get this movie, it was sold out in my country. I don't think that is a coincidence. It's one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.",1325548800,,634,4.610619469026549

Here he mounts mini movie cameras on Hachtwey's photo cameras and shows us the world's tragedies as Jim himself saw them. From war theaters in Bosnia, Kosovo, Palestine, Somalia (hence the title) to poverty and gruesome mines in Indonesia, Jim has seen it all. His goal: to make people around the world aware of the horrors of war so as to build up forces to prevent this tragedy from happening again. A bit idealistic perhaps, but he puts immensely powerful images behind this goal.

Jim took all black and white pictures, and some scenes of this documentary are shot back home in NY and show Jim working with his assistants in the darkroom (this is predigital) to make perfect prints of his negatives.",1324425600,,768,4.688888888888889

I have showed clips of this to people, as at this time it is completely on Youtube...and they don't know much of photography, but were blown away by what they saw.

1218660,1,B00000I1I4,"Though they sure don't see it that way.

Asking if your work exploits others is much like the question, ""Should I turn my headlights on?"" Well, asking it answers it. Yes, James Nachtwey and Christiane Amanpour are fabulously self-absorbed people who believe they are not cynical but honest. I disagree. They would not have jobs if not for human suffering, a suffering they jet to in lovely, comfy airplanes wearing crisp jeans (I'm betting he doesn't crease those himself) and perfectly coiffed hair.

And then, after I sat through this weary tale of people talking about how brave and important they were, I had to listen to Mr. Nachtway tell me that if people could just see the suffering bullets and sulfur cause, they would certainly stop. And what image is behind him while his voice-over bleats these pious platitudes? Teenager boys in Ramallah tossing rocks, and wishing they had better weapons. Come on bud. You watched a man get beaten to death. Those people saw the suffering they directly caused, and they reveled in it! While it easy to fantasize that war is caused by old men far away, that is just not the truth. The wars he has photographed, in Kosovo, South Africa, and Rwanda, and elsewhere, were all caused by those closest to the action, the hackers and shooters and starvers and murderers who joyously slaughtered their fellows.

How James Nachtway is going to stop war by having his carefully developed and framed and displayed images enjoyed by wealthy New Yorkers sipping wine at pricey museums is beyond me. Lay off the self-congratulations; he has clearly made lots of money taking photos of people in their most desperate moments, convincing them that these pictures would alleviate their suffering. I wonder how it worked. There is a way to help people. Taking their picture isn't it.

If you've read this far and don't give me an unhelpful vote, I congratulate you. This is indeed a tale of brutality and misery, but the inhumanity of man is visible in many venues.",1254528000,28,1993,4.818713450292398

It may not have inspired me to go out and photograph wars, but it has inspired me to find a purpose with my photography and to send a message. The movie captivated me throughout, and I found myself impressed with Nachtwey's character and ability to handle himself in such deadly locations.

A must-see for any photographer, amateur or otherwise, as well as for anyone who just wants to know where all those pictures come from. Jim Nachtwey is one of my newest heroes.",1226188800,,638,4.696428571428571

1218664,5,B00000I1I4,"XXXXX

Near the end of this powerful film, James Nachtwey, the photojournalist profiled in it states what might happen if people could see what he has:

""What you see [in war or conflict] is unmitigated pain, injustice, and misery.  It has occurred to me that if everybody could be there just once to see for themselves what white phosphorus [used in bombs, artillary shells, and mortar shells] does to the face of a child or what unspeakable pain is caused by the impact of a single bullet or how a ragged piece of shrapnel can rip someone's leg off--if everybody could be there to see for themselves the fear and grief just one time, then they would understand that nothing is worth letting things get to the point where that happens to even one person, let alone thousands.""

He continues by stating why the war photographer's work is so important:

""But everyone cannot be there and that is why photographers go there, to show them, to reach out and grab them and make them stop what they're doing and pay attention to what is going on--to create pictures powerful enough to...shake people out of their indifference.""

This is what this documentary does.  It reaches out and grabs you through Nachtwey's photographs enabling you the viewer to see what he sees.  Besides seeing pictures and moving images of pain, injustice, and misery, the viewer also gets to see poverty, suffering, violence, brutality, and famine.  You also get a glimpse of the danger Nachtwey is exposed to on each assignment.

Besides brief comments by Nachtwey, there are also comments made by others throughout the film.  Specifically, there are comments given by Chief International Correspondent for CNN Christiane Amanpour, two foreign editors, a Reuters cameraman, and a screenwriter.  Make sure the subtitles are turned on as all comments are not in English.

Locations we follow Nachtwey to include The Balkans, Kosovo; Jakarta, Indonesia;  Ramallah, Pallestine;  New York City; Hamburg, Germany; and Kawah Ijen, Indonesia.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has some extras that I found to be very interesting.

In conclusion, this is a powerful film.  Near the beginning of this Academy Award nominated documentary Nachtwey says,

""In a war, the normal codes of civilized behavior are suspended.""

After viewing this film, you'll actually see that this is definitely true!!

1218685,5,B00000I1I4,"This documentary was by far the most moving, piercing, inspirational piece of film or any media I have ever seen.  Not only is the subject, James Nachtwey, deeply inspirational in his devoted, quiet, compassionate commitment to documenting the lives of the countless millions suffering today, but the film itself is extraordinary.  Seeing the full context of the photographer's subject before the photo is taken (through a videocamera attached to the camera) makes the effect of Nachtwey's work, his life, and the lives of those he photographs that much more powerful.

In other parts he has another video guy following him around, showing an area, and James deducing what is the most important piece of the scene to shoot. Cristiane Amanpore chimes in several times as do other experts in the field and they talk about his dedication to his job etc... in a few shots they show post processing on a some photographs....

1218689,5,B00000I1I4,"By many accounts James Nachtwey is the premier war photographer of our time. This powerful documentary of his life and work runs along three tracks. First, we learn from Nachtwey and his friends who are interviewed about his personal story, how and why he became a war photo-journalist, and what he is trying to accomplish in his work. We learn, for example, that this most famous of artists who makes a living by taking the ""express elevator to hell"" is, in fact, an introverted, retiring and even mysterious man. He reflects on to what extent he has benefitted from other people's misfortune. Second, the film makes a powerful statement on the horrific atrocities that he records in Kosovo, Rwanda, Jakarta, and the West Bank, whether war, urban poverty, or famine. One cannot watch this film without lamenting the stupefying dehumanization and depravity that takes place in so much of the world. Third, one is forced to consider the extraordinary, evocative power of images to capture and define reality in ways that text never can. In much of the film we see exactly what Nachtwey sees when he does his work, since he has a mini-camera attached to his own camera. It is not pleasant. For Nachtwey, twenty-five years in photojournalism has provided an extraordinary moral-aesthetic vocation. I count this as one of the best films I have ever watched.",1169596800,2,1353,4.9126637554585155

I was very interested in the small camera attachment that was mounted on his lens, but its a gadget, and its not considered as a journalistic item-and its not tell the story, its the photographer-his stories, his views.  Otherwise the documentary should of been ALL VIDEO.  The photographer was cool, and knew what he was doing, knows is craft very well, under pressure.

1218693,5,B00000I1I4,"I had never heard of Richard Nachtwey prior to this movie, but I'm pretty sure I had seen his work. His metier: stark, bleak, black-and-white images of suffering people from war-torn lands. This film is partly a self-documentary of his work, from the Balkans to Rwanda to Ramallah. Outfitted with miniature video cameras, Nachtwey allows us to see him (his right index finger at least) in the act of composing his famous photos. The effect of this self-photography is jarring at first, and one wonders whether Nachtwey is being self-indulgent in covering himself in this manner. But what soon becomes apparent is that he is so devoted to his work and to his subjects that he seems hardly to notice that he is being recorded. The film also records Nachtwey's relationship with his editors at the German magazine Stern, with other news people (including CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour) and his friends.

It is both fascinating and disquieting to watch Nachtwey at work. Seeing him confront a broken painting on the ground in Kosovo, one sees him trying different angles and compositions in an effort to tell his story. Then, he is literally in the faces of people enduring the most appalling grief. From the hysterical women awaiting a loved one's disinterment to a man grieving over a mass grave, Nachtwey comes within a few feet of his subjects. It is made clear that this is done with their consent, but the seeming sense of violation is palpable. Yet by capturing them at their moments of greatest anguish, Nachtwey's subjects allow him to portray the real the cost of war.

If there is a weakness to the film, it is that it fails to pierce the enigma that is Richard Nachtwey. Even his close friends don't seem to know what drives him to the most dangerous places on the planet. The closest we come is Nachtwey's own comment that by depicting war at its ugliest, he may dilute its appeal. Richard Nachtwey, soft-spoken man of very few words, speaks loudest through the silence of his photos, many of which scream with the agony of war and its dislocations. A fascinating film that can be watched several times.

He is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger. It needs guts and commitment to do a job which has constant fear of getting killed.

1218710,5,B00000I1I4,"I'm basically repeating some of what other people have stated, but I have to add to this as well: This is an amazing film that I am extremely grateful to have found.  It provides such a close, intimate, detailed view of one person's life, and it shows exactly how courageous one person needs to be in life.  It shows the smallest details about being a photographer - the patience required, the willingness to put yourself out there for a better cause, the caring heart you need to have to help the people you capture in film, and the professional detachment you need to walk away from them.  But not only does the film provide a view into a war photographer's life, which it does supremely well, it also shows us the life of the many people he works with and photographs.  The lives these people lead are sometimes incredibly difficult, and both Nachtwey and Frei manage to capture them without any pretense.  Just like someone else mentions in the reviews - this film was definitely one of the most profound movie watching experiences of my life.  It has definitely affected me in very many ways.  It's simply an amazing film - please watch it if you can.",1099612800,13,1156,4.555555555555555
1218711,4,B00000I1I4,"This 2001 film is a documentary about James Nachtwey, a war photographer whose camera has documented much of the horror in the world during his 20 year career.  He was in Nicaragua, Rwanda and Bosnia during some of the most profound episodes of violence and his photos have won acclaim worldwide.

He's a slim, quiet and determined man and he is totally devoted to his craft.  He risks his life and brings the agony right onto our television screens and magazines.  Christiane Amanpour narrates some of the film and we see video clips of her as well as our photographer, covering the story of a huge mass grave that has been dug up in Bosnia.  Because is through their eyes that the rest of the world will learn these stories, she talks about the tremendous responsibilities that they, as journalists, face.

I sat there, transfixed by one terrible image after another.  There's death, destruction, crippling poverty and crippled people.  And the there are the grieving relatives.  It was awful.  So awful, in fact, that I actually fell asleep.  Perhaps that was because all this horror was too much to handle in one sitting.

I'm glad this film was made.  It's a testament to one man's dedication to his profession.  It's just that it's really hard to watch.  And so my recommendation is limited to only those hearty souls who are willing to catch a glimpse of the world's misery.",1088726400,20,1381,4.7196652719665275
1218712,5,B00000I1I4,"I watched the war photographer by chance whilst travelling through the Netherlands.  It captured me from the first second and 2 years later it still remains one of the most profound experiences i have ever had through watching any sort of media.  James Nachtwey's struggle to be ethical and powerful as a voice for the voiceless, astounded me and brought me to tears.  I rarely shed a tear in any sort of film, but this hit me like i was there.  May all people who see this film begin to understand more, the preciousness of life and the tragic waste of it that comes through war.",1081296000,7,580,4.443396226415095
1218713,5,B00000I1I4,"A fellow photographer describes how close to the action JN gets and you are amazed to the see pictures that have been the result. A couple of months ago, JN was a passenger in a vehicle in Iraq, when a grenade was throw in beside him. The passenger next to him grabbed the grenade and threw it out, losing a hand when it exploded. JN is always close to the action. Watch and see.",1078876800,4,379,4.135135135135135

7909285,1,B00000I1I4,"Another product of the typical Media Mastermind. They want you to do things THEIR way.
Christiane Amanpour is very biased, and she confesses it with pride. Of course, she wants you to think she's always right.
Many who are paying attention know better.
James Nachtwey does the bidding and stands for those that the Left prefer.
The are sloppy and ignorant of the results of their mentality and bias.
Israel will be bombed to ashes or made into slaves if these people get their way. Think it through. They stand with rock throwers.
They ""want to stop war"". Sounds great!
Hitler would have won the day with this mentality; DON'T KID YOURSELF!
There are always thieves and mental defectives, and wars will be fought.
Those African and Asian countries that are LIKE HELL?
They weren't hell when England was running the show. France, well, maybe.
Get a grip! Stop following the Liberal Agenda Mastermind!",1475625600,,899,4.8441558441558445

7909287,4,B00000I1I4,"Definitely a very ""first person"" on-scene(s) look at the life of a combat photographer. What makes this production so unique is that you not only see the still pics Nachtwey took, but he had an attachment on his camera frame that took good quality video of the same thing he was seeing through his still camera lens. In fact, you can see the top of his camera body and the tip of its lens in every video.

Really gives appreciation for the environment/setting - and most importantly physical dangers he faced getting his photos.

His quiet narration of events gives you the emotional impact and the thoughts running through his head as he gathered his pictures.",1452729600,,661,4.689655172413793
7909288,5,B00000I1I4,"Impressive! The film is a bit slow, but overall adds to the tension and seriousness of the topic. One gets a good understanding of the neture of Nachtwey as well as the situations in which he works.",1428710400,,198,4.378378378378378
