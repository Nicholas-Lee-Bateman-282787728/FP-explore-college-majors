It would be well worth some studio cleaning up the print, redoing the subtitles (big and yellow), and adding some special features that supply historical background non-Chinese/East Asian would not know. The cinematography would be top-notch, but the DVD quality is poor - though not intolerably so.

The Chinese title is actually ""The Hegemon of Western Chu"" (Xi Chu Bawang), referring to Xiang Yu, rather than anything translating as ""The Great Conqureror's Concubine,"" referring presumably to Miao Ge, clearly an attempt to hook in a non-Chinese audience more likely to know (of) Chen Kaige's ""Farewell, My Concubine"" (which film title in fact refers to a key episode in ""Xi Chu Bawang""). If the film has been entitled, originally or in translation, ""The King of Han's Wife,"" then the title would have been right on target.

Essentially, the film can be understood as the interaction (vague word to avoid giving away any spoilers) among four characters, Xiang Yu, a member of an aristocratic family that has given generals to the Chu kingdom for generations, Miao Ge, his similarly aristocratic concubine, Liu Bang, of commoner origin, a petty official under the Qin government that has unified China, and L Ji, his wife, also a commoner. As Qin rule collapses, Xiang Yu raises an army and goes into revolt. Liu Bang does the same and soon attaches his weaker force to th illustrious young general.

Although all four main characters are fully fleshed out, the one who seems to have the greatest initiative, since the most manipulative of the other characters, it is L Ji, hence my opinion on what would have been the most accurate title.

This film has it all: sweeping battle scenes, riveting hand-to-hand combat, complex webs of intrigue, heart-breaking romance, fascinating psychological portraits, creative reimagining and expansion of the fragmentary historical record, an evocative soundtrack. The film is the equal of the best films on the Qin-Han period, the age of the unification of China and the establishment of its bureaucratic empire, Chen Kaige's ""Emperor and the Assassin"" and Zhou Xiaowen's ""Emperor's Shadow."" Buy it, since it's hard to find in video stores (I just bought it online on the strength of learning what it was about - a gamble that has paid off impressively).",1379203200,,2401,5.055555555555555

If an american studio were to buy this film and refine it, it would be definately rereleased.  It is better than jet li's Hero and Crouching tiger hidden dragon.  It is more realistic as it focuses more on drama then action although the fight sequences were very well done for its time.",1195171200,4,386,4.550724637681159

And since the transfer to DVD was not anamorphic, the image that you get is probably only 1/4 of the screen which makes the subtitles even more difficult to read. It may have been a great movie but I'll never know because I had a hard time following the dialogues or plot from such tiny subtitles.",986256000,16,433,4.3580246913580245
