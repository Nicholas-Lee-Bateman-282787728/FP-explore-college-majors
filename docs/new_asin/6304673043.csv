906175,4,6304673043,"I loved this film. It's not typical Elvis in the sense that for once he doesn't play the irreverent gigolo with a woman waiting for him in every bar; his one big dream is to do music in his own nightclub. He's quite likable and ends up even being noble when he turns the plot (of a soldier engulfed in an bet with his army  buddies to 'defrost' a gorgeous nightclub dancer) on its side when he falls in love with the stunning Juliet Prowse. This one is similar in tone to VIVA LAS VEGAS because female lead Prowse is an independent woman, and not a typical Elvis groupie- forcing a real courtship to occur between them. That's why I like it all the more. Once again, the Hollywood stereotype of the aloof woman comes in (see my other review for YOU WERE NEVER LOVELIER). Juliet Prowse is never, in my opinion, 'cold' or 'refrigerated;' even when she turns down an early pass from Elvis she's not so much rude as she is firm in her convictions. But what a dancer- with a pair of gams that stretch into next week!! Her introduction in the film (which shows a spinning cardboard cutout in a marquee window turn into the actual Prowse- in a near-strapless white, shredded dress) is breathtaking!!",1029801600,,1192,4.442922374429224
906176,5,6304673043,"I'm only 16, but I LOVE Elvis movies.  My mom got me started watching them.  Out of the Elvis movies I've seen, ""G. I. Blues"" is my favorite.  I would recommend that anyone who hasn't seen an Elvis movie, make ""G. I. Blues"" your first.",1028073600,,235,4.177777777777778
906177,4,6304673043,"In his first musical comedy, Elvis Presley stars as lady-killer Tulsa Maclean, an Army Sergeant stationed in West Germany. Tulsa and his buddies hope to make enogh money to open a small nightclub upon their return...
G.I. Blues marks the debut of the new Elvis Presley. Fresh out of the army, gone were the sideburns the press had found so offensive, and gone was the flashy, hip attire. The look was more convervative.
The changes in terms of image and film genre do not mean that G.I. Blues was an inferior film, which many Presley biographers have implied. It remains a well-crafted musical comedy with a number of solid songs and a strong female co-star. The only negative result is that Elvis would be discouraged from making other types of movies. This film is considered the prototype for future Presley films, which, unfortunately, declined in quality as the decade progressed.
Produced for Paramount Pictures by Hal B. Wallis. Released November 23, 1960. Color.",1027987200,2,970,4.957055214723926
906178,2,6304673043,"It is notable that Elvis made a movie reflective of his patriotic service. On the other hand, in light of the fact that he actually decided AGAINST performing in ""Special Services"" while in the Army, it must be  assumed that he was uncomfortable in unintentionally ""exploiting""  his military experience. So despite the amazing financial success of the  movie and soundtrack album, it must also be assumed that Presley wanted to  get the whole thing behind him and pursue serious movies, picking up the  pace from the 1958 black and white classic, ""King Creole"".  (Ofcourse he made two consecutive impressive dramas following this mild  musical). But whatever misgivings he might have had with the tired and  predictable plotline (his character reluctantly gets involved with a bet  that he can't win a date with a dancer) he certainly seemed to enjoy  performing the songs - his vocals are terrific on all the tunes, especially  on the classically-based ""Tonight Is So Right For Love"", and the  bouyant rocker ""Shoppin' Around"". The production numbers are  particularly colorful and well presented. Juliet Prowse's dancing sequences  are effective, though more ""adult"" oriented than one might  expect. So if you can stand watching Elvis in a 1950 movie made in 1960, go  for it - enjoy the music.",963619200,2,1296,5.071090047393365

907201,4,6304673043,"I always enjoyed this movie because it kinda' reminds me of my own army days.  It reflects Elvis' stint in the Army, for which he put his career on hold for the entire two years he served -- then he went back to Germany as a civilian to film his story with the blessing of the Army.  I always respected him for accepting his draft notice and serving his time; unlike some celebrities who refused to go when they were drafted -- which I feel is despicable.

There are great scenes of the German countryside, and small insights into army life of the day.  If you like army tanks, there are scenes in the motor pool and on the gunnery range you will fine interesting -- especially the views of the tank interior.",1407369600,,709,4.30827067669173

907639,3,6304673043,"Movie looks and sounds great on DVD. For those fans who got tired of Elvis ""Light Hollywood Musicals"" and just waited for something to happen...and happen it did on December 3rd, 1968..can look back at even the weakest of these vehicles and say, it's really not bad and there are 3-4 good songs and Elvis....is Elvis!

This 1960 effort had to be a ""down"" experience for Elvis, whose previous movie was the exceptionally strong King Creole, filmed on location and featuring a dynamite cast, nice black and white cinematography, mostly terrific songs (albeit 3 too many); here, too, we have ""location"" shots..but Elvis was not there.

He was probably happy about that, as he had expressed around 1958 that he would not accept a post in Entertainment Services but a post any soldier would be assigned to.

This reviewer assumes that the furthest thing from Elvis' mind in '58 would be making a tired, obvious ""Service Comedy"" upon his return.

This movie has alot going for it, production numbers professional (though curiously rsique on the Prowse numbers) - plus the songs actually fit the flow of the picture > but the script is almost devoid of humour, and any chance to challenge the 25 year old star goes right out the window. Problem: the writers, powers-that-be, had to make ""Tulsa"" so likeable that the romantic interest, juliet Prowse, was never REALLY mad at him for using their date as leverage in a bet. No dramatic tension...just, shucks, isn't he the most!

Along these lines, and as in many of Presley's flicks, the viewer does not need a Degree in Cinema to see that certain scenes that should have been done over. Elvis is great in one scene...almost amateurish in the next. All that matters is that Elvis is handsome and has a good beat.

But since it all comes down to Elvis, he looks great, is engaged, and sings his brains out. On one beat ballad, an operatic rewrite, ""Tonight is So Right For Love"", his range is astonishing. This one, and several others, would have souned just fine on the King Creole soundtrack!

Overall, recommended for Elvis across the board - that new ""family"" demographic for the superstar; for those '50s only fans, note that Sun Records associate Scotty Moore is heard throughout on the soundtrack.

Finally, the military theme works well and has traveled nicely through the many decades.",1334620800,,2334,4.802992518703242

907642,4,6304673043,"Elvis Presley's first film after a stint in the army, G.I. Blues (1960) was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed, among his early films.  The formula of mixing light drama with music, helped set the mold for most of Presley's films in the years that followed.

Presley plays Tulsa McLean, a tank crewman in the US Army, stationed in Germany.  Tulsa also sings in a band, and has dreams of opening a night club.  The men place bets that Dynamite, a member of the outfit, will be able to spend a night alone with a night club dancer named Lili (Juliet Prowse).  When Dynamite is transferred out, Tulsa reluctantly agrees to take his place, and starts a relationship with the sexy dancer.  Tulsa's buddy Cookie (Robert Ivers) also begins a romance with Lili's gorgeous roommate Tina (Leticia Roman).  When a fellow soldier has to leave to get married, Tulsa is pressed into caring for a little baby, and calls Lili for some assistance.  Things get shaky when Lili learns about the bet, but with Tulsa's charm and a baby in the picture, it's a situation that is short lived.

What works well here is that Presley's character attempts to build a serious relationship with one woman, and isn't floating playing the field, between several females.  An superbly talented performer in her own right, Juliet Prowse is more than a pretty face, and has the maturity and stature to match up to Elvis, and they seem to have very good chemistry together.  The military factor adds interest to the story, and still allows for the various musical numbers, that includes Pocketfull Of Rainbows, Frankfort Special, Shoppin' Around, and the title track G.I. Blues.

Elvis may not have been pleased with the formulaic films that followed G.I. Blues, but when his movies with a more serious tone failed to do as well commercially, the studios and Presley's manager Colonel Tom Parker firmly channeled his career for better or worse, in the musical/comedy direction.",1319068800,,1958,4.846846846846847

907784,3,6304673043,"To say that a movie is an ""Elvis Movie"" suggests that he actually had a movie genre all to himself (Kind of like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers).  In fact, a post Army Elvis movie is usually simply a musical romantic comedy, and that's what this film is too.  It also happens to fit into the category of ""Service Comedy"", humor based on military situations.

GI Blues was his first post-Army film, and one of his best films.  His next movie, Blue Hawaii, is the one that basically fixed the formula for the rest of of his films, and of course 1964's Viva Las Vegas would be the quintessential post-Army Elvis movie.

GI Blues is a little different from what would come later.  Instead of shouldering the entire movie himself, he has a strong supporting cast in this one, with his two army buddies having a lot of screen time, and each with a love interest of his own.

The plot of the film is kind of risque for 1960 - he is blatantly trying to sleep with a night club dancer to win a bet (and one of his buddies has fathered a child out of wedlock).  Being a decent guy, his conscience won't let him go through with it, but he still gets engaged to the girl by the end of the flick.  The sexuality of this film is actually more frank than in most of his later movies.

The movie functions as a good time capsule of its era - what life was like for American soldiers stationed in Germany during the middle years of the Cold War. Reminds me of some of the stories my father tells, who was staioned there about the same time. And there is some beautiful color footage of Germany in the movie, too.

Juliet Prowse, the leading lady, is an exotically attractive woman, who very closely resembles Leslie Caron in the face.  She looks very ""European"", which kind of adds to the allure of both her and the film.

Elvis' acting, never exactly Oscar material at its best, is even below par for him in this film, perhaps because he was out of practice after 2 years of military duty.  But his new post-Army persona is likable - he is now and basically forever after cast as the All-American young man, hipper, cooler and more musically talented than most, but still the kind of guy who likes kids and babies, and calls women ""Ma'am"", but still backs up his buddies in a bar room brawls and is the just the kind of guy you'd like to have working next to you at your job, or in your platoon.

GI Blues is simple entertainment, so when you watch it, just sit back and enjoy being entertained - by one of the best singers (and worst actors!) in the history of entertainment.",1237075200,,2560,4.315240083507307

BLUES"", while he was still in the ARMY, the truth was, someone else was a stand-in for Elvis, for the filming in GERMANY. The movie is basically about 3 Fellas, who are trying to raise the money to start a Night Club in Oklahoma, once they get out of THE ARMY. So to raise the money, they go to their Sargeant, but he would only loan them half of the money, even though he signed the lease on place. So when a bet came up that a certain Soldier could spend the night in the apartment of ""Lili"", JULIE PROWSE"", ""Tulsa"" played by ELVIS, bets all of the money they already had on the Soldier, along with other Soldiers betting too. Then the Soldier, known as ""Dynamite"", ""EDSON STROLL"", gets transfered to ""ALASKA"" because of complaints that were coming from some rather irate fathers. That placed the opening of The Night Club in jeopardy. They had to come up with a  replacement for ""Dynamite"" fast. ""Cookie"", ""ROBERT IVERS"" tricked ""Tulsa"" into taking ""Dynamite's place. Though it all started out as a bet, ""Tulsa"" started falling for ""Lili"", which complicated matters for him and jeopardized all the bets for the other Soldiers, because he called it off. ""Tulsa"" winds up winning the bet anyway when he gets ""Lili"" to help him after breaking the Milk Bottle of Rick's Infant Son's. ""Tulsa"" takes the Baby over to ""Lili's Place"". He winds up spending the night, with some of the Soldiers parked across the street in an all night Coffeehouse, making sure of when he leaves. Of course when ""Tulsa"" rolls out of Lili's Place in the morning, all of the Soldiers get paid and ""Tulsa"" lands in trouble. When the ""Captain Hobart"", ""JOHN HUDSON"", was told that there was a bet that ""Tulsa"" could spend the night in ""Lili's Apartment"", ""Tulsa"" tells him that he was Babysitting for his Buddy ""Rick"", ""JAMES DOUGLAS"", so that he could Marry his Fiancee, ""Marla"", ""SIGRID MAIER"". That gets ""Tulsa"" off the hook and makes everybody happy. The Movie ends happily after ""Tulsa"" does one more Song: ""DIDJA' EVER"".

Ive been a big fan of his music since I was old enough to walk but never really gave his movies a second thought (shame on me).

I cannot yet vouch for his other films but hearsay is that they are mediocre and carry pretty much the same plot line for the majority of them. However so, this film is amazing. The quality and clarity of this digital copy is crisp and clarified in comparison to the TV version I stumbled upon.

The bet: a soldier has to spend the night in the apartment of a German nightclub singer known for her habitual rejection of suitors. As anticipated, Tulsa ends up having to do the job...but there are a number of complications, namely his fellow soldiers having their own romantic problems.

The movie shows West Germany as a pretty soldier's outpost, and the movie makes no reference to World War Two. Elvis Presley sings a number of songs, including one based on an old German folk song in a cute scene at an outdoor puppet stand. Perhaps surprisingly for its era, the story mentions a boy born out of wedlock with the parents marrying afterward.

This is an average movie, not as strong as Elvis's earlier ones but better than his later ones. Entertaining, but little better than fluff.",1512864000,,1042,4.657608695652174
