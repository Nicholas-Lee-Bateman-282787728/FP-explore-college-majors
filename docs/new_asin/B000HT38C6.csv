2640425,5,B000HT38C6,"The previously available DVDs of early John Wayne westerns out of the public domain are a strain to watch. Most come from deteriorated copies where picture detail and clarity and sound quality are bad at their best.

I bought this expecting the same. But to my surpise, this release by a major studio like Warner blows all the other early to mid 30's John Wayne westerns to bits.

The picture quality is superb. Clarity of detail is exceptional. Warner Bros should be commended for having well preserved copies in their vaults. I plan to get the other John Wayne installment from Warner Bors too. And three features in one DVD is outstanding.

Paramount did an earlier relaese of a Tim McCoy feature with John Wayne. Like the Warner release, the picture and sound quality was very very good. But it consisted of only one feature and cost more than this Warner triple feature. I hope Universal would also release their Buck Jones westerns soon, even if many of these are already in the public domain. A good quality B western would sell anytime",1180224000,17,1043,4.688524590163935

2640427,5,B000HT38C6,"People bash the 50-60 minute ""oaters"" of the 30's...and now that I've watched these three and the three on the other Wayne set that just came  out..i say forget them!  These are fun movies, kind of like longer westerns with the boring stuff cut out!  The critics say these  were all filmed in just a day or two...well the stories usually are about a day or two....and there is great riding, shooting,  action and backstabbing in these action  packed hours...and JOHN WAYNE and...the DUKE!  That's right...his HORSE was named DUKE and  second billed!!  I never knew this...

what a  deal for around  ten bucks...EVERY fan of  Duke...or John Wayne should pick up both sets...

2640441,5,B000HT38C6,Three very good old movies that were transferred well and are entertaining.,1410912000,,75,5.333333333333333
2640442,4,B000HT38C6,"Nice picture quality for 1930s westerns.  Where you see the scenes that are less clear and perhaps more grainy, those are the scenes that were inserted from the Ken Maynard movies that were made only a few years earlier.  Warner Brothers dressed John Wayne in clothing similar to Ken Maynard, and gave him a white horse like Maynard's Tarzan, so they could use some of the action scenes all over again.  Saving time and money in filming the new version.

These are three entertaining movies from early in John Wayne's career.  Most of the reviewers seem to write favorably of them and this is no exception. These are produced by Leon Schlesinger who was later the producer for many of the great Warner Brothers cartoons.

The female lead in ""Ride Him, Cowboy"" is Ruth Hall, who in 1931, the year before  this film was the second female lead in ""Monkey Business"" with the Marx Brothers.  A few months after ""Ride Him, Cowboy"", she was co-star with Tom Mix in ""Flaming Guns"".  Ruth  lived to age 92, dying in 2003.  What a shame that apparently no one ever interviewed her about her early career with Mix and Wayne.

""Haunted Gold"" draws on every old stereotype for spooky, or ""old house"" movies of the 1930s.  The supporting characters are the somber and spooky characters you would see in a Laurel and Hardy or an Abbott and Costello haunted house movie.  John Wayne's sidekick is a dignified black man named Blue Washington, and it is embarrassing to see a man nearly the same size as Wayne have to act in the worst stereotype sort of role for a black person in that era.",1409443200,,1572,4.567857142857143
2640443,5,B000HT38C6,"Early movies, but can be entertaining just the same. A must for a Wayne fan.",1409443200,,76,4.133333333333334
2640444,5,B000HT38C6,John Wayne in his late 20's remaking some of Tom Mix's best westerns in sound with Leon Schlesinger  (of Looney Tune fame) heading the proceedings.  Duke the Wonder Horse can do everything except tie John's shoes.  Some of the greatest fun westerns ever produced.,1408752000,,263,4.931818181818182
2640445,5,B000HT38C6,Great movie.,1407801600,,12,5.5
2640446,4,B000HT38C6,"Before Stagecoach catapulted John Wayne to ""overnight"" stardom in 1939, dude had been toiling away in Poverty Row's back lots for a dang decade, making cheap quickie horse operas. But, somewhen between 1932 and 1933, Warner Brothers hired our guy, who was then 25 years old, for six oaters (at $825 per picture) that were either remakes of movies by silent-screen cowboy star Ken Maynard or featured footage of Maynard's stunt sequences. As you and I know, Maynard was a superb horseman who performed his own riding stunts. And John Wayne's horse, Duke, is a good stand-in for Maynard's steed, Tarzan.

In Ride Him Cowboy (1932), harmonica-playing Texas drifter John Drury (Wayne) arrives at Maricopa County and promptly rescues a temperamental white stallion named Duke from execution. Duke had been accused of assaulting a now comatose rancher. John Drury gets to the bottom of this and also finds time to track down the notorious outlaw, the Hawk (Frank Hagney), who is masquerading as a respected citizen.

Ride Him Cowboy benefits from a strong supporting cast and solid storytelling. It remakes Maynard's The Unknown Cavalier (1926). The note I take from this is that John Wayne's character is heroic but not superheroic. John Drury, thru the course of the film, isn't the best marksman, is framed and nearly hung two times, and gets beat in a one-on-one scrap. Also, it's never good to be the accused standing in front of someone called Judge ""Necktie"" Jones from Desolation. Spirited horse Duke hijacks several scenes with its neat show of resourcefulness. In one scene, potential love interest Ruth Hall topsy-turvies the damsel-in-distress trope by riding to Wayne's rescue.

Like Ride Him Cowboy, The Big Stampede (1932) is an above average shoot-em-'up. Deputy Sheriff John Steele (Wayne) is summoned to the executive mansion and tasked by the governor with establishing law and order in lawless Santa Fe, New Mexico. The New Mexico territory is being terrorized by ""rustlers, renegades, and bad men,"" this jeopardizing the push for colonization and for statehood. Steele gets on the job just in time as drought-stricken settlers are making their way to New Mexico on a massive cattle drive. Them rustlers, headed up by a stentorian Noah Beery, are champing at the bit.

The Big Stampede, which remakes Maynard's The Land Beyond the Law (1927), is my favorite of this bunch. It strays from the typical hour-long B-western in several ways. For one, John Wayne has more to do in this one. I like that the craftiness of his character; I like his style and showmanship. We observe this early on when Steele insinuates himself in Santa Fe as a drunken drifter so he can scope out the situation on the sly. I like that he has a calling card  la the Scarlet Pimpernel (although this does bite him in the bum). I like his unpredictable moves, case in point, how he handles the bandit Sonora Joe (Luis Alberni). You know this lawman's got swag when one thug is heard to lament: ""That maverick of a deputy has fooled us again!"" Too, Noah Beery, who shares his more famous bro-bro Wallace's booming voice and commanding presence, makes for a good big bad. And another item on Duke the trick horse's rsum: rounding up stampeding cattle by its lonesome.

Haunted Gold (1932) is a fun re-do of one of Maynard's most beloved movies, The Phantom City (1928). It's a peculiar tale in which John Mason (Wayne) comes to claim his half share of the abandoned Sally Ann mine. But there's a rub: Mason must find the hidden gold, fend off an outlaw gang, and unmask the spooky ghost that haunts the mine shafts. And, yay, that miracle horse, Duke, is here, too.

And yes, the DVD's audiovisual quality is commendable. Definitely worth a buy.",1398556800,2,3730,4.873817034700315
2640447,5,B000HT38C6,this 3 movie set of john wayne is well worth the money it has 3 of his early b movies that are very good made in the early 30 tys the picture is very clear and the sound is good also.,1398556800,,183,3.4878048780487805
2640448,3,B000HT38C6,"These are some of ""the Duke's"" early movies.  Who can resist John Wayne?  He is an icon.  We have quite a collection of his dvds and they are watched over and over.",1396742400,,164,4.0625

2640454,5,B000HT38C6,John Wayne is the number one top cowboy in the movies. I already had The Big Stampede but needed Ride Him Cowboy & Haunted Gold to help my John Wayne Collection. He is outstanding in his later movies but without his earlier movies you can't follow his career.,1291852800,2,259,4.416666666666667
2640455,3,B000HT38C6,"Welllll, it is John Wayne. And they are Westerns. And they do remind me of the stuff I used to watch Saturday mornings a long time ago. But Wayne really isn't very good just yet. And these really aren't very good movies, either.
Although it's interesting to see Wayne while he was learning his trade, you'll only watch these once. If you're a collector, you'll want these for your collection. Personally, I doubt that I'll ever watch them again. And I really like many of Wayne's movies, like The Searchers, Liberty Valance and The Quiet Man.
Anyhow, 10 years later Wayne's stuff was much better - try 1944's ""Tall in the Saddle."" It's a lot better and a lot more like the future Wayne. And if you like the movies from that era, you should take a look at some of Randolph Scott's stuff, too.",1290211200,,791,4.462068965517242
2640456,5,B000HT38C6,"All three movies are really good & interesting.  I never did idolize John Wayne, but in these movies, he really did some good acting - I don't care what anybody says.  Duke the horse was hilarious - better than Roy's Trigger. The black & white is clear and crisp, and the sound is good.  I'd say don't pass up the chance to buy this dvd.",1274918400,3,337,4.153846153846154
2640457,3,B000HT38C6,"The video quality of this DVD was much better than I expected. It helps strengthen the point I made in a recent review I gave for ""Hurricane Express"" that it behooves the distributors of these old films to do a better job in restoring the picture and sound. In the case of this DVD a favorable effort was achieved.

I certainly would not rank any of these three films among John Wayne's top twenty, or even top fifty films. They are competently made ""oat burners,"" in the style of a Hopalong Cassidy, Buck Jones, Gene Autrey, and other beloved western stars of the era. The films are entertaining, yet uncomlicated. The distinctions between good and evil are clear.

It is amusing to see that John Wayne's beautiful white horse is named, ""Duke."" One may only speculate how many jokes were tossed around about that off-camera.

Again, if one if attempting to attain a complete John Wayne film collection, they should add this DVD to their library. It certainly is not ""Rio Bravo,"" or ""The Searchers,"" but it beats the heck out of a lot of morally ambiguous garbage on TV today.",1189987200,9,1076,4.62303664921466
