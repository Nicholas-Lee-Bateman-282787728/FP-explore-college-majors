8038298,2,B000641YZ0,"This is not the kind of DVD that you work out along with and when it's done, your exercising is done as well.  Instead there are simply demonstrations of techniques.  There are three sections:  Swedish massage, facial exercises, and facial accupressure.  The massage section demonstrates various ways to use your hands (tapping, cupping, slapping, pounding, chopping) followed by quick demonstrations.  Each of the ten facial exercises is shown only once, followed by a recommendation of how many times you should do it (usually 5).  That section of the DVD lasted ten minutes which would seen to mean if you did each exercise the required number of times, you are looking at 50 minutes for a facial workout.  The facial accupressure section was extremely rushed, and at the end the demonstrator said it should be done for at least 30 minutes per day.  This DVD has a 1998 copyright date, and I do not believe that then, or now, anyone could devote a total of 80 minutes per day to facial exercises.  I have only watched this disc once so I cannot attest to whether these exercises work.  The demonstrator does say that once you learn the exercises, you could do them while doing other things, but unless you were willing to let people see you making goofy faces, you'd have to do then when alone.",1219190400,2,1297,4.724444444444444
