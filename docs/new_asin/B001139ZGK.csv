8239989,4,B001139ZGK,"MOUNT NEMRUD: THE THRONE OF THE GODS divides itself neatly into two
parts. The first tells of its discovery, first by a German
archaeologist in the 1880s, and subsequently by the American architect
Theresa Goell and German archaeologist Friedrich-Karl Dormer working in
collaboration during the Fifties and the Sixties. Since then there have
been further expeditions led by Turkish as well as non-Turkish
specialists, most notably Sencer Sahin of Ankara University.

The second half takes us back to the creation of the massive tombs,
reliefs and tumuli on the Mount, the work of the Kommageneian ruler
Antiochus, who not only managed to unify his people but determined that
there should be some permanent structure erected in his memory. He had
every right to assume that he deserved it; he had won a great victory
against the Romans, led by Mark Antony, although horribly outnumbered
in terms of troop-numbers. This achievement forced the Romans to
abandon their colonialist aspirations and leave Antiochus and his
people in peace. His reputation soared; to such an extent that he
likened himself to a god; hence his desire to build the structure.

Although successive expeditions have yielded much information about his
life, there is much that remains to be discovered. Ornek's documentary
doubts whether this task will ever be accomplished: the site is in a
state now that further excavations might destroy it permanently.
Perhaps Antiochus's kingdom will remain intact forever, resistant to
foreign colonizers, just at it did when Mark Antony tried to invade.

In light of Ornek's previous work on ATATURK, it is clear that MOUNT
NEMRUT is inspired by the same nationalistic beliefs. Antiochus is a
forerunner of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who inherited a divided nation and
unified it, while resisting any invading forces. Like Antiochus against
the Romans, Ataturk also won a great victory against the Allies at
Gallipoli, and thereafter cemented his place at the helm of a new
nation. While Ataturk did not consider himself a God, he also has a
monument constructed in his honor in Ankara: the Ataturk Mausoleum, or
Anitkabir, which went up fifteen years after his death.

This celebration of Antiochus's work on behalf of his nation also sets
the archaeologists' work into sharper focus. While they might be
inspired by the noblest motives (to reveal the past to present- day
scholars), their efforts are still neo-colonialist, especially when the
majority of archaeologists come from outside the Republic of Turkey.
MOUNT NEMRUT suggests that there are certain aspects of local cultures
that they never will discover, despite the use of increasingly
sophisticated scientific equipment.",1456617600,,2692,5.268065268065268

The old history is extremely interesting and this video we bought from Amazon was a ""must have"" for us after recently climbing to the site in Turkey on an Overseas Adventure Travel tour.",1322956800,,331,4.610169491525424
8239992,4,B001139ZGK,"This is a fascinating, straightforward documentary about the remarkable burial site of King Antiochus I, a contemporary of Julius Caesar who ruled in Commagene on the Euphrates (in what is now eastern Turkey). I'd seen some of these colossal sculptures before, but never understood their context. Thanks to excellent photography and interviews, I feel like I've been to Mount Nemrud. I only wish this doc was twice as long and went into deeper detail about theoretical reconstructions of the site, but as it is, it serves as an excellent introduction.",1227052800,2,551,5.133333333333334
