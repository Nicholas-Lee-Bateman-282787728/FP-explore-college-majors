3478234,5,B001B1876Q,I can't wait till the next one come. Movie made for the fans and up and coming fans.,1221436800,,84,3.7222222222222223
3478235,4,B001B1876Q,"When I saw the previews for ""Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow"" one thought instantly coalesced in my mind.  Worst idea ever.  I mean with all the decades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/classic-storylines/dp/0785118624/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">classic storylines</a>&nbsp;being nearly untouched outside of the comic medium and only two underwhelming short-length straight to DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/animated/dp/B000CEVC9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">animated</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/features/dp/B000FP2YYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">features</a>&nbsp;released so far -not to mention hype for the future live-action crossover film- why on Earth would Marvel choose to do a Baby Avengers film right now?  Still, I am a superhero/animation fanatic and a man's gotta watch what a man's gotta watch, so I gave this a chance.  This movie kicks the hell out of the previous two entries.  It's the perfect example of a horrible idea executed (almost) flawlessly.

This is Marvel on a sci-fi bender reminiscent of classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-series/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>.  In it, sentient AI being Ultron has shattered The Avengers and is rapidly progressing in conquering the world in order to replace every imperfect living being with flawless machines.  13 years after Earth's Mightiest Heroes fell, we catch up with their offspring, taken by Tony Stark and hidden in a remote hideaway undetectable to Ultron's mechanical army.  The line-up includes James Rodgers son of Captain America and Black Widow (!?!?), Pym is obviously Hank and Jan's kid (annoying as hell, too),  Azari whose parents were Black Panther and presumably Storm, and Torunn daughter of Thor, who left our realm to take the throne of Asgard after his father's death. When curiosity kills their cover, the super-powered tweens are forced to flee the only home they've known with only The Vision's head to guide them.  After a sound thrashing attempting to rescue Iron Man, who was captured buying them time to escape, the kids meet Lil' Hawkeye, who was assumed lost with his father but carved out an existence for himself right under Ultron's nose along with his band of renegades.  Finding Betty Brant among them the team finds that there is only one way to defeat the invincible Ultron: find the strongest one there is and unleash the beast.

The science fiction setting does wonders for this concept.  Bringing Marvel fans into an unfamiliar setting (for a comic movie, that is) is a great way to offset the initial resistance to the changes made to the source material.  A short list of WTF's: Widow and Hawkeye were the item, Hank Pym built Ultron, Ultron built Vision and Jocasta, Cap's shield is vibranium and therefore unbreakable, etc, etc, whiny fanboy nitpicking and all that.  Fact is, this is obviously non-canon material and that makes a lot of the changes -unnecessary as some of them are- less annoying.  Most of the characters are handled very well.  The pacing of the story is outstanding for being only a little over an hour and has a lot of goodness crammed in without ever feeling rushed.  Some of the action scenes are killer, with Iron Man's duel with Ultron being particularly kicka$z.  The substory with Torunn's longing for her father seemed to telegraph an obnoxiously obvious deus-ex-machina finale similar to the comic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimates-2-Grand-Theft-America/dp/0785117903/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimates 2: Grand Theft America</a>&nbsp;that thankfully didn't materialize and turned out rather sweet all around.

Now just because the pacing was spot-on doesn't mean there shouldn't have been more.  Hank and Jan Pym -aka Giant/Ant Man and The Wasp- are scarcely mentioned while the other kids all get moments to reflect on their parents deeds and fates.  Their kid gets on my nerves, too.  A little more T'Challa wouldn't have hurt either.  They didn't even bother naming Storm as Azari's mother, you just have to be nerdy enough to figure it out yourself.  Considering this is aimed squarely at a casual audience, that is hardly a smart move.  And why, oh why would Anthony Stark -one of the smartest human beings alive- attempt to combat an AI that subsists by controlling machines by building fraking battle-bot representations of the old Avengers?  Turns out THAT was the worst idea ever.  And boy is the Black Widow-bot ugly.

I had written a scathing review for this cartoon in my head before I even watched the thing.  That's how much I thought I was going to hate this.  Junior Avengers, my a$z!  But I really can't dislike this film.  To think that there have been so many crummy adaptations of brilliant concepts (I see you over there,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-3/dp/B000UR9T8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 3</a>, you can not hide!) and this dumb idea turns out a winner.  It's a crazy world we live in, people.  This disc comes with a making-of doc and two previews for the upcoming animated features ""Hulk vs Wolverine"" (yay if it's brutal!) and ""Hulk vs Thor"" (meh).  Also in the works is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Hulk/dp/0785120122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Hulk</a>&nbsp;film which should be sweet.  Anybody else detecting a theme, here, or is it me?  I expect a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-War-Hulk/dp/0785125965/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World War Hulk</a>&nbsp;adaptation after that. Go Big Green!  If you're into seeing a futuristic post-apocalyptic version of Earth's Mightiest Heroes come to animated life than this will certainly float your boat.  Color me shocked, but this is loads better than anything I could have come up with for that concept.  Have a look.",1221264000,5,6277,6.167816091954023
3478236,5,B001B1876Q,"This is a great, really well done Marvel story and the kids in no way take away from its appeal - they rather add to it. I was shocked to find that I enjoyed this much more than the previous Ultimate Avengers DVDs (which I felt suffered from unavoidable comparisons to the graphic novels they were based on). As another reviewer mentioned, Next Avengers has a lot of heart, and far more depth and action than you would expect from something for the kids. This would be a great series if they can maintain the level of the writing. Highly recommended.",1221264000,8,550,4.455445544554456
3478237,4,B001B1876Q,"I am often very skeptical of ""young"" or ""kid"" versions of these types of stories; take Anakin in the Phantom Menace or many anime cartoons i simply have trouble getting my arms around.  But this cartoon treated the kids more like teenagers and there was little or no ""fart"" humor and with the addition of Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, etc. it took on a serious tone without being overwhelming for kids.  Put this team in charge of any product aimed at appealing to kids and their parents - great stuff!  Only minor complaint was it seemed to end quickly with some battles left to do and you are left feeling maybe they are thinking tv series - which i wouldn't mind but it seemed to end quickly... my son has watch it twice in two days.  If your kid (and you) likes comics, Ben 10, etc. this is your speed.",1220659200,,802,4.326666666666667
3478238,4,B001B1876Q,"Three and a half stars, and some minor SPOILERS.

It's not great, but it's pretty good. NEXT AVENGERS: HEROES OF TOMORROW is the latest from the Marvel line of animated direct-to-video dvds, this time introducing a new and very young generation of superheroes. Sometime in the near future, the Avengers have a fateful last encounter with the invincible robot Ultron, and the Avengers fall. This gives Ultron free rein to begin his world conquest. Tony Stark survives and manages to whisk away the sons and daughter of the Avengers to the Arctic Circle. There, the offsprings while away the years in hiding, trained and mentored by an aging Stark and raised on stories of their legendary parents. And, then, one day, another Avenger appears, this event resulting in Ultron finally tracking down Iron Man and finding out about the children.

There are four kids, initially. Torunn, the daughter of Thor. Pym, son of Giant Man and the Wasp. Azari, son of the Black Panther (and X-Men's Storm?). And James, the red-headed son of Captain America and Black Widow. And, later on, Hawkeye's kid enters the picture as the leader of a fugitive band barely surviving in Ultra City. These kids have huge footsteps to follow, and, because they're kids, they flaunt unblemished confidence and don't really think that far ahead. Some good character development unfolds as these kids are soon easily humbled by Ultron and his Iron Avengers (which used to be Stark's Iron Avengers, until Ultron corrupted their programming). The vigorous Torunn, in particular, who before was unshakeable in her self-belief, sinks the furthest. How she regains her faith, not only in herself but in her father, the Thunder God, is one of my favorite moments in the film. It falls to James, being the son of Captain America, to inspire and lead this team. But, ultimately, the last desperate hope for beating Ultron may rest on unearthing a certain giant green grump...

Yes, most of the adult Avengers are dead and Ultron has just about taken over half the planet. With the stakes so raised, an undercurrent of gravity permeates the film, this tone also tremendously aided by the film score, which bears faint echoes of THE MATRIX theme. Yet NEXT AVENGERS: HEROES OF TOMORROW caters to a younger audience than did Marvel's  first four flicks in its animated direct-to-video line. The kids will eat this up. Originally under the working titles of Teen Avengers and then Avengers Reborn, NEXT AVENGERS can't help but give off faint vibes reminiscent of the Teen Titans cartoon, only with not so much anime. This similarity is marked mostly in the kids' behavior and dialogue, which often strays towards the lighthearted. The animation isn't shabby, but certainly doesn't hold a candle to what I glimpsed in the First Look segments included here, which showcase the two upcoming movies: Hulk Vs. Wolverine and Hulk Vs. Thor.

This brings us to the dvd's special features. There are two blah documentaries: the self-explanatory ""Legacy: The Making of Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow"" and ""Kid Power: Next-Gen Marvel,"" which focuses on Marvel comic books featuring teen superheroes (New X-Men, Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius, Power Pack, etc.). What's definitely worth checking out are the First Looks for Hulk Vs. Wolverine (with Deadpool) and Hulk Vs. Thor (the Hulk comes to Asgard). The animation previewed for these two films is eye-catching, to say the least.

By no means is this the first dystopian future ever presented onscreen, and there's nothing new or groundbreaking coming from that angle. The grim backdrop, however, does lend more weight to the kids' adventures and firmly elevates the film above a regular Saturday morning cartoon experience. The kids themselves, specifically created for this film, are stock characters (yet with enough flair to keep your kids' eyeballs glued to the screen). It's interesting to note how similar and how different the kids' abilities are from their parents. Hawkeye's ability is exactly the same as his dad; same for Captain America's kid, except that James's shield manifests when his wrist mechanism is activated. Pym boasts both of his parents' powers (including the Wasp's stings), while Azari has his dad's agility and also something extra, an ability to generate electrical surges (again, Storm?). Meanwhile, Torunn is strong, durable and can fly, but wields a bulky blade, instead of a hammer. By the way, for me, Torunn and Hawkeye turn out to be the most interesting characters. I particularly enjoyed Torunn's attempts to speak like an Asgardian, only to then hopelessly fall back to contemporary colloquialism.

As far as I know, this film follows its own internal continuity, separate from that of the Marvel Comics mainstream and Ultimate titles. For one thing, this film has Tony Stark as Ultron's creator, rather than Hank Pym. Of these five Marvel animated direct-to-video films so far, I'd probably rank this behind the two ULTIMATE AVENGERS films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Avengers-The-Movie/dp/B000CEVC9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Avengers - The Movie</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-Avengers-2-Rise-of-the-Panther/dp/B000FP2YYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate Avengers 2 (Rise of the Panther)</a>) and maybe tied with that odd duck,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Strange-The-Sorcerer-Supreme/dp/B000R5OFOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme</a>. It's certainly better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invincible-Iron-Man/dp/B000K7UBTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invincible Iron Man</a>. NEXT AVENGERS: HEROES OF TOMORROW is only an hour and 18 minutes long, but that's time enough to pepper in several great action-packed sequences, culminating with the kids facing huge odds as they go against the Iron Avengers and Ultron. Two observations which made me enjoy the film even more: the Vision's noggin being lugged about like poor Yorick's skull and how the Hulk doesn't lose that aura of menace even when reduced to a receding hairline. Wispy white hair and scraggly goatee be damned, the Hulk is still the strongest one there is.",1220572800,10,6332,5.637985309548793
3478239,4,B001B1876Q,"When I first read the promotional blurp of the idea behind this direct-to-dvd movie, I thought ""No Way!""  I'm so tired of seeing dumbed-down kiddie versions of my favorite comic book and cartoon characters, I was ready to give this one a automatic pass.  Seeing the pre-release art above really didn't inspire me to want to see it either.

Well, I was wrong!  This was a pretty darned good little cartoon.  Yes, it's aimed at kids, and doesn't have the mature themes present in the first two ""Avengers"" animated films, and yes, it has giant robot Avengers, but there's a logical reason for their existence and the idea is actually part of Marvel continuity, first used in ""Universe X,"" I think.

The Avengers have made the ultimate sacrifice in their final fight with the indestructible robot, Ultron. But all was not lost for Tony Stark (Iron Man) has kept the children of the Avengers safe and raised them to become the teenage heroes of tomorrow. Now James Rogers (Son of Captain America and Black Widow), Torunn (Daughter of Thor), Azari (Son of the Black Panther), and Pym (Son of Wasp and Giant Man) must finish the fight their parents started. Soon the arrow-slinging son of Hawkeye join their ranks, but it will take more than five teens to destroy the machine that defeated their parents. For the young heroes to have any hope of winning they must find the missing Hulk.

Iron Man (Tony Stark) has a major role as the childrens' guardian and mentor, and an elderly Betty Ross and Bruce Banner appear.  Needless to say, if old Banner is on hand, a geriatric Hulk can't be far behind...And once he appears, it's really funny.  Let's just say the Hulk is even more...cantankerous than ever.  One of my favorite Avengers, the Vision, is also in the movie.  There's one more guest appearance at the end, but i won't give it away.

When I saw the trailer below the idea of an old Hulk just seem full of humorous potential: Images of Hulk with a walker and a pair of glasses hanging around his neck come to mind, or how about Banner getting really mad at the drug store cause his arthritis medicine went up 2 dollars, and hulking out on the vitamin isle?  ""Hulk is on fixed income! AAARRGGHH!""

The mothers of some of the tiny Avengers is left to speculation.  I'm willing to postulate with reasonable confidence that Torunn's (Daughter of Thor) mother is either the Enchantress, or more likely, Valkyrie.  No explanation is given for Torunn's enchanted sword, but it has many of the same properties of Thor's hammer.  Valkyrie carried an unbreakable enchanted sword.

It is implied that Azari's  (Son of the Black Panther) mother is Storm.  In a brief flashback, Black Panther is shown from behind holding hands with a stately-looking white-haired woman, in current continuity Panther and Storm are an ""item,"" and it would explain Azari's spark and lightning powers.

The only real mystery is who is little Hawkeye's mother?  He has white hair, so I was thinking maybe Scarlet Witch, since both her brother Quicksilver and father Magneto had white hair, apparently from birth, but he displayed no mutant powers, so it puts my theory in doubt...

Pym, the youngest of the kids, is the son of Wasp and Giant Man, Janet and Hank Pym.  he's a cute kid, but his character is very young and talks a lot and would probably annoy some people, just like real kids.

Ultron is the main villain in this movie, and he's done right this time.  In the ""Avengers"" Saturday morning cartoon from a few years ago, he was so poorly designed and animated it was laughable.  In this version, he's big, dark, mean, and scary!  For some reason, Tony Stark says he created Ultron, although in Marvel continuity it was Hank Pym, but, hey, anything is possible in an alternate future.",1220313600,4,3761,4.692073170731708
3478240,5,B001B1876Q,"Another movie from the animation department at Marvel Studios. It seems like every 6-9 months the studio is pumping out a new feature length animation.

Next Avengers is no exception. Like the first two Avengers animated features, Next Avengers features clean lines and  bold colors. The animation is smooth and very well done; just slightly below traditional Disney animation but still way above normal, daily televised animation. It looks very nice and very rarely lets down on the action. It's very well animated (this is the standard definition; I don't know about Blu-Ray).

The story is well done, though slightly predictable. In short, Tony Stark entertains the children of his Avengers with a story every night in preperation for the day when Ultron would return and force Stark / the rest of humanity into a final showdown against elimination. He brings together the children, helps outfit them to fight, and sets them off to locate the long lost Hulk in order to give the team some real power. The movie ends well, with the possibility of sequel hinted at, though not so blatenently as it could have been.

The voice acting is, normally, quite well done. With only a few exceptions the youths manage to avoid sounding overly whiney or angst-ridden. Some of the dialogue from Stark is a little...over the top, but it's nothing that is not livable.

All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that fits right in with the rest of the Marvel animated universe.",1220313600,2,1462,4.855421686746988
3478241,5,B001B1876Q,"Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow takes place in the very distant future when our heroes, The Avengers, have died after a battle with Ultron(one of the groups long-running foes).  James (son of Captain America and the Black Widow), Torrun (daughter of Thor), Azari (son of the Black Panther and the X-Men's Storm), and Pym (son of Ant Man and the Wasp) live under the protection and tutelage of Tony Stark (Iron Man).Their only link to the past is a bed time story Tony tells them about how their parents fell. One night the Vision(whom the kids recognize as 'The Ghost' from their bedtime story) returns and he warns Tony that Ultron has taken over almost every major city on the planet & that something has to be done. That's is where things start and shows how the Next Avengers are born. The story is, as how another reviewer online mentioned, Marvel's equivalent to DC's Teen Titans with decent amounts of youth, action and humor mixed in. I, personally, was expecting something a little more serious for Marvel Animation's next project. DC has been consistantly putting out serious depictions of their properties animation-wise for quite some time now. Nevertheless, Next Avengers is still a good time to be had. I liked it alot.

Extras include:Legacy: The Making of Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow -- A nearly eleven minute featurette.  The creative team (Christopher Yost, Craig Kyle, Gary Hartle) behind the film discuss its creation, Kid Power: Next-Gen Marvel -- Nine and a half minutes with Craig Kyle, Chris Yost, Marc Sumerak and Chris Eliopoulos as they discuss the presence of youth in the Marvel Comics Universe, First Look: Hulk vs. Wolverine -- A four minute yarn with creatives Chris Yost, Frank D. Paur, and Craig Kyle as well as still, segments from the eventual release and a glimpse at the voice talent in action.  We learn that Deadpool makes an appearance, First Look: Hulk vs. Thor --Same as above but with a blonde Norse God, Trailers:The Invincible Iron Man, Speed Racer: The Next Generation, The Forbidden Kingdom, Hulk vs. Thor, Hulk vs. Wolverine, Spectacular Spider-Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (old school cartoon), Doctor Strange, Ultimate Avengers: The Movie, and Ultimate Avengers 2.

While the animated feature will probably appeal to the younger set alot more, I did enjoy it for what it was. It's definitely worth adding to your collection if you've got all Marvel's animated features up til now like I have. After seeing it, I think Marvel should make it into an animated series on TV.

By the way, I think Lions Gate just doesn't care, as the closed captioning spells the ""Pym"" character as PIM, and ODEN is a type of Japanese stewed foods, not ""Odin"" Leader off the Norse Pantheon of gods.

3478769,5,B001B1876Q,I think this was a very well done movie. It good for the adult and younger viewers. Being a huge marvel fan I can't get enough. However some animated movies are a little too violent for the youngest kids. My whole family likes this one. It's dark enough for the adult fan. Ultron is really menacing in this one. And now it's free on prime. Definitely a must watch for the avenger fans.,1447027200,2,385,4.287671232876712

3478870,3,B001B1876Q,"The frustrating part for me is more of a general concern there seem to be alot of direct to DVD releases staring people from the Marvel Universe but very little effort put towards coming up with a universal continuity.  This is fine it reminds me more of the imaginary tales comics where you take the characters from the established universe and place them in a setting where it is understood from the beginning that there will be no impact on the real storyline.  How much more fun would it be if someone just decided Ok all Marvel DVD releases are going to be in the same universe it would have been a chance for all of these characters particularly Francis Barton Hawkeye's son who I really liked.

Overall-This story about an older Tony Stark's efforts to safeguard the next generation of Avenger children is fine for what it is and overall is a good place to start for younger audiences.",1366156800,,892,4.5625

3478872,5,B001B1876Q,This movie is fantastic.  I love everything about it.  I love that they give a general history of the Avengers.  I love that the kids are SO like their parents.  I love that womanizing Tony Stark is not the father of any of the kids but got stuck rasing all of them!  Think it is hysterical they gave the Hulk gray hair.  I do not have one negative thing to say about this movie and I love that my little hero loves to watch this over and over.,1364428800,,444,3.9886363636363638

place a few years after the Avengers battled the monstrous Ultron and lost,
leading to the Earth's population decimated.  The children of the Avenger are
secretly cared for by Tony Stark and from there... I'd give away the rest of
the movie.  It's as much Avengers as one could think of, with an inside joke

Although I find the premise of Ultron being able to destroy the original Avengers quite unbelievable, this story line is very well done for such a possibility . The story has a slow start, but only for a few minutes, immediately taking off in fantastic story telling this animation feature leaves nothing to the imagination, bringing to life a futuristic tale of what seems to be an unbelievable scenario, acted out as if it were the storyline, it is superbly done , and Highly recommended ! 4 out of 5 stars on this one, it's awesome!",1318204800,2,641,4.440677966101695
3478883,5,B001B1876Q,"My 4 year old loves this movie and so do I. It was cute and endearing, funny and entertaining. My son loves superheroes,but pretty much all shows and films are way too mature for him to watch. This movie was perfect!  I don't understand why Marvel and DC gear their products to grownups who really are too old for comics and cartoons. It would be wise to target the younger audiences so that they can flourish and grow with their beloved superheroes thus strengthening the franchise. My husband grew up watching the overly graphic, overly sexual and graphically violent superhero shows and movies that were popular in the 90s. I would never let my son watch any of those shows and movies and as a parent its nice to finally have a choice...a good PG cartoon vs the other stuff he shouldnt be watching but wants to watch cause its all there is. As a parent I am responsible for censoring my child's entertainment and often times have to be the bad guy who says No I'm sorry but you cant watch that. My husband is always wanting to share the things he loved as a child with our son, but in the case of superheroes cannot as we realize that we cannot allow him to watch most of what is out there. This film was a great way for them to share the Marvel Universe together. It was a safe PG cartoon that we can all watch together and love. As a mom I really loved this film, it tugged at my heart strings and even made me cry a little...Its about the orphaned children of all of the Avengers. I loved finding out which Avengers ended up with each other and seeing an old Tony Stark and old Incredible Hulk was kinda cool.  It was a great film and I really hope that they continue the Next Avengers and build it up into its own huge slice of marvel universe, for the next generation of little Marvel fans .",1315267200,,1799,4.2727272727272725
3478884,5,B001B1876Q,"Its strange to write reviews, but I do this for the fun of it! Next Avengers, are the kids of the Avengers down the time line. It doesn't really follow any comic stories, Just something that puts together. I was really impressed about the simple art works and colors in the movie. Its strange to see the kids being raised by Iron Man. Who would of thought of that lol. Just simple good good action show, to introduce to the young adults to the comic world.",1313971200,,456,4.313953488372093
3478885,4,B001B1876Q,"This is a rather fun movie, depicting a new generation of Avengers.

First off unlike other direct-to-DVD Marvel movies this is PG. So Kids can watch it. the battles are mainly people fighint and defeating robots, so no one gets hurt, and there is no blood shed of any kind. unlike movies like Ultimate Avengers, Hulk Vs, etc.  So this is good for a family movie. good for young fans to watch and enjoy, and good for older fans to help fill in some blanks. the movie is well written for a kid audiance and should be fun for them to watch, and it has enough for adults to watch as well.

now it really doesnt matter wich version of the Avengers you are familur with, weather its comics, Ultimate Avengers movies, or even the other cartoon depictions of the Avengers. This movie can really fit in with any continuty or verson. for the most part.

The story revolves around the children of the Avangers, with a few core meambers making a return. The orignal Avengers have defeated evil and have taken a much needed rest. some of them marry and have kids. Captain America marrys Black Widdow, Giant Man (Ant Man) and Wasp marry, so do Black Panther and Storm, and Thor and Hawkeye also have children. These children are James son of Cap, Pym son of Antman, Azari son of Panther, Torunn daughter of Thor. However great evil has returned. Ultron (here created by Iron man instead of Antman) has arisen again and defeated the orignal Avengers. Thus Iron man takes the kids into safety.

years later the four children (James, Pym,Torunn, and Azari) are kept safe by Iron Man, they are trained by him and live safe in their homes. The Vison acts as a spy for Iron man. However the safety of the children is compromised and they must face their destiny as the next Avengers. they along with the son of Hawkeye must face off against Ultron along with the help of Hulk. Here Hulk is much older but still just as savage. Thor also makes a cameo apperance. the children face many hardships but win out in the end. leading to a new generation of heros.

again this is a fun movie and viewers of all ages can enjoy it.",1307318400,,2102,4.432642487046632

3478887,3,B001B1876Q,"It's a little ironic that the best Avengers movie is the one clearly made for kids.

Next Avengers is thoroughly a kids movie, much moreso than any other Superhero animated film, but it's also pretty fun.  I enjoyed some of the childish jokes and fun action.  They did remarkably well with developing each kid as the descendant of the superpowered Avengers we know and love.  The storyline has a nostalgic ""what-if"" Saturday-morning-cartoon feel.  It develops, in a mild way, a darker world where only Tony Stark survives and takes responsibility over raising the Avengers kids.  Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow is just good old kid fun with some wisecracks about the Avengers, which just happens to make it more entertaining than the actual Ultimate Avengers releases.",1278720000,,771,5.079365079365079

My daughter is 4, she's a Disney/Princess girl (thanks mom...) of course being a comic dad I am introducing her to superheroes and this fit the bill perfectly.  I picked up the 2009 Animated Wonder Woman Blu-Ray as well and that is much more geared towards a tween compared to this movie which seems more like a 5-8 year old (she's a smart one too).  She quotes the lines and ALWAYS wants to watch this above any other movie in our stable (right up here with the Dark Crystal, go figure).

There are a few surprise appearances from other Marvel characters. I was also skeptical of how Hulk was going to interact with kids but they played that off really well.

It isn't as violent as Hulk VS but there is a lot of action and the story line was very good.  For those adults who are a fan of the Xmen cartoons and such, I would recommend giving this movie a shot.",1238544000,4,608,4.0

Tony Stark, Bruce Banner and Thor are present, tying this new storyline into the great Marvel Universe History.

I thought it was a cheezy attempt to create a marvel teen titans.  I was so horrified with the Ultimate Avengers, its failure to tell a story, and the sub-par animation that I never watched the second Ultimate Avengers.  I certainly wasn't going to pick this dvd up.

After being blown away by Hulk Vs. I decided to pick up a copy of Next Avengers.  I got a copy on clearance at a closing Circuit City, so I figured if it stank then I wouldn't lose out on much money.

Much to my surprise, this movie was PHENOMENAL!!!!!!  I was grinning from ear to ear the entire movie.  If you're a skeptic but a big fan of marvel, give this movie a try!!!!  I can't tell you how glad I am that I did.  It is my favorite piece of marvel animation so far.",1234656000,,908,4.251461988304094
3478903,4,B001B1876Q,Very entertaining video that takes the history of the Avengers and creates bold new characters which are way more believable than the Young Avengers in comics.  I hope they make a sequel to this or turn it into a series.  I especially like the concept of the Iron Avengers.  The fights are not as brutal as recent Marvel Animation films so children (of the right age group) will  be able to enjoy it.  Good film definitely worth buying.,1234051200,2,436,4.538461538461538

3478906,4,B001B1876Q,"I really enjoyed this movie. And the blu-ray video and sound quality were great.  The other reviews go into the story more.

However, as a viewer you are forced to watch a number of previews at the beginning (you can fast forward, but cannot skip or get to the top menu). I thought this practice was long gone. Looks like the blu-ray programmers need to learn this lesson all over again.

Also, this movie does not allow for ""resume playback."" I had to shut down my system in the middle of the movie and come back to it. Since resume playback doesn't work on this disc (it does work on my Sony S350), I had to wait for everything to load, then fast forward my way through the previews and through the movie to find where I left off. I would have bookmarked it if I had known that there are actually movies that don't support the blu-ray standards like this one.

Not to mention the pop-up menu graphics were just bad. And annoying at that with the ""wheel"" interactivity of them.

Knowing this I probably would have gotten the regular DVD instead of blu-ray.",1230595200,,1057,4.4

3478911,4,B001B1876Q,"As a long time Marvel Comics fans, I'm almost a little scared. After years of substandard movies, Marvel has finally put together a series of films (not including X-3--that sucked) that make every Marvel comic fan happy. Things have gone so well in the live action arena, people have forgotten about the high quality animation that Marvel is putting out. Iron Man was pitch perfect in the live action outing this summer. Before that however, it was a great animated movie. The Liongates partnership with Marvel has produced great stuff and the Next Avenger is no different. Crafting new characters for younger audience, this movie promises that the animated film line can grow the Marvel audience in a way that movies and comics are not. The story is great, a well known bad guy, new kid friendly characters base on classic heroes, and great visual style all work together to make this a story that will be easy for non comic fans to enjoy.  This is a crucial part of the marketing machine that Marvel should not neglect. Where is the next generation of comic readers coming from? If they are smart they will put these characters into print, create a video game, put together some easy to access digital comics (their current subscription service is not a great model) and get eyeballs on new characters and old.",1225584000,15,1312,4.754385964912281

This one is good but they need to step it up a bit if they want to catch up with dc animation. This one is very predictable and simple. If your going to be simple give me alot of action. I hope they do more avengers, but build up the originals first. They really need to take notes from the Justice League (awesome). I remember reading books when Thor would go off and start yelling,screaming and thunder pops off and it was like ... yeah! I haven't seen any of that in the cartoons. Bring the old Marvel back. Marvel should be breathing life into there characters. Anyway, Hulk vs Thor looks like I may get my wish. This one is like an appetizer.",1225152000,,797,4.215686274509804

The characters are great, the story is innovative and inventive, and there are some very funny moments and interesting character developments. It is heavy on the Sci-Fi. There are some rather stiff voice-acting moments, and the pace seems to rush rather rapidly to the end after a great opening and slow introduction of characters, which is my favorite part.

3478921,5,B001B1876Q,The Next Avenger's: Heroes for tomorrow is a video I would recommend for any cartoon or comic book collector. The story line was really good and the characters were believable.

When i first put it in, i was in awe by how good it all looked, and how well the characters moved across the screen.  It all seemed pretty natural which is a good thing in animtion.  Visually, this is a great movie.

Story-wise, this was kind of lacking.  I am a huge Captain America and Ironman fan, and as i was watching it, i realized that they were not part of the story and it kind of upset me.  While they are mentioned, this is more of an emotional ride than any, and it doesn't do very good in that department.  Yes...bad guys are after the kids of the Avengers, but when they do fight it is lackluster...until the very end that is!  That FINAL battle was the saving grace for the whole movie.

Without giving too much away, old school Comic Book fans are like...uh huh...uh huh...okay i guess i can believe that.  Then the end like 20-30 minutes reel the comic book fans back in.  There are a few funny scenes too which were kind of qwerky, but fit.

Seeing Ironman and The Hulk in action was also a favorite of mine.

Overall...Fans of The Avengers will enjoy the end of the movie, while Kids should enjoy the whole movie.",1222992000,2,1329,4.30241935483871

Even though it is more aimed at children than the Ultimate Avengers flicks, The Next Avengers provides some rousing action and surprises that will satisfy Marvel fans young and old alike.  The story picks up with the Avengers biting the big one in battle with the murderous Ultron, and surviving member Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark watching over their children.  Among them are James; the son of Captain America and Black Widow, Torunn; the daughter of Thor, Pym; the son of Giant Man and Wasp, Azari; the son of the Black Panther, and the son of Hawkeye.  Things are peaceful until Ultron makes a comeback, seeking to extinguish the legacy of the Avengers.  Soon enough, The Next Avengers are seeking out the only force strong enough to take down Ultron and his minions: the Hulk.  With crisp animation and solid voice acting, The Next Avengers is an entertaining piece, and with previews of the even more promising looking Hulk VS Thor and Hulk VS Wolverine, this DVD is a worthy pick up.",1222905600,,1113,4.711340206185567
3478926,5,B001B1876Q,"I can't believe I'm saying this but this is the best animated movie Marvel has done so far! And believe me, when I first saw the trailer and read the premise I did not like it.  I think what scared me about this one is that after several offerings from Marvel animated movies (some ok, some decent, and some great), suddenly we're getting what seemed like a ""kid-friendly"" movie which to me completely went against the point of doing these direct-to-DVD movies.  Kid friendly Marvel stuff should be left for regular T.V.  Well I'm happy to say I was wrong about this one.  I think the fact that it's an original story is where its strength lies.  First off, the setup for the story is well executed.  Ultron defeats all the original Avengers and Tony Stark escapes with their offspring.  Another strength is the characters.  James Rodgers, the son of Captain America and Black Widow, is first portrayed as a slacker so it's cool to see his father come out in him as things progress.  Torunn is the daughter of Thor and I think she may be my favorite character.  Plus she has my favorite scene in the movie where she prays to her dad and the way he `answers' her is awesome!  Azari is the son of Black Panther and Storm (not a spoiler, they're now married in the comics).  He's kind of the level headed one and it's cool to see the powers of his parents combined in him. Pym, the son of Wasp and Giant Man, was the only one I really didn't like because he's basically the annoying one of the bunch.  And Francis Barton is the son of Hawkeye and he's pretty much identical to his dad.  They really portray Ultron as a real threat here and they make me believe that he could actually defeat all the Avengers.  We also get some action from an aged Hulk and it's great to see him let loose.  I wouldn't be surprised if Marvel includes these characters into their comic continuity somehow because they've got some really great material here.  Highly recommend checking this out.",1221868800,,1972,4.4636871508379885
