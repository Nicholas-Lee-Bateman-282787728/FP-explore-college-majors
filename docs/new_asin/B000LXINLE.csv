8165099,5,B000LXINLE,A wonderful video of the modern sport of tandem surfing. I love it.,1449532800,,67,4.230769230769231
8165100,4,B000LXINLE,"Bob Torrez has done a fine job on this production, it's a polished and concise offering with little waste. The world of Tandem Surfing is indeed quite small, however it's roots are firmly planted in the Waterman tradition. The inclusion of Steve & Barrie Boehne is perfect. They bring a unique aura to the world of Tandem. It would not be an understatement to say they have had the most significant input to Tandem Surfing over the last 40 years. (I would suggest their DVD released a few years back as the ideal 'learners DVD'). If you are keen to understand the 'inclusiveness' of Tandem I cannot think of a better offering in which to experience it on the LCD screen.

Cheers, Simon & Nicole (Freshwater Beach, NSW, Australia).",1173830400,,730,4.658914728682171
