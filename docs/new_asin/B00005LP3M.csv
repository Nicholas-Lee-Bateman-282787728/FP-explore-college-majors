1622891,3,B00005LP3M,"Made on a rather small budget, CHOKE is one of those films that has some good things going for it, but in spite of that, it still remains a misfire.  The movie has an original plot, but sometimes originality doesn't always make a film great.  It's what one does with that inventiveness that elevates a mediocre film to greatness.  Dennis Hopper plays a businessman who has been doing some shady deals with a man named Ron Sloan.  But he finally decides to shake this loser, but Sloan has other plans.  The movie opens with a teenage girl getting loaded with her boyfriend, but then she suspects he is still in love with his ex-girl friend who has just shown up at his house.  She leaves in a fit of anger, and on the way home, she hits and kills a young law student with her Mazda.  She tells Daddy, and his sleazy ex-partner overhears the conversation and decides to blackmail Hopper with this knowledge.  They get in a fight in the restroom of Hopper's company building, and Hopper strangles Sloan, but stops before he kills him.  Or does he?  Enter the irrepressible Michael Madsen as a man who has witnessed Hopper's deed and decides to help him.  Come to find out Masden is himself a serial killer, and the movie focuses on the warped personality of Masden and the questionable sanity of Hopper.  The movie's deliberate pace and talkiness ultimately sabotages the film, but the surprise twist ending does have an impact.  Hopper gives a restrained performance most of the time, and Masden is effectively morose and witty.  The supporting cast as a whole is pretty terrible and if they had stronger people in those roles, it could have helped the movie's overall effect. However, CHOKE gets choked by its own indulgences and we're left with a quasi-interesting film.",1114387200,4,1770,4.686084142394822
1622892,5,B00005LP3M,"Finally, a movie to rise above the Hollywood dross. This is the role which Denis Hopper will be remembered for. Thank you Mr Sjogren for justifying the price of our expensive home entertainment system with this fine film. Two thumbs up!",1054080000,3,236,4.780487804878049
7944193,5,B00005LP3M,"Choke is not a big budget movie but it sure is a hell of a lot better than most of the garbage the make now. At least this one is fun and has
a Madsen and Hopper who are great in their roles and Madsen is driving a bad azz 70's classic muscle car! Favorite part is when he's
being chased by police says 'I feel like I'm on Starsky and Hutch' !!! The plot is like a Tarentino movie going in different directions and
a twist at the end which makes it worth watching. Madsen should have made more movies like this! Those who say this movie is a waste
of time a bad movie obviously like movies with dull plots and CGI and sex and gore to keep them awake. This is a good classic movie.",1516406400,,680,3.9347826086956523
7944194,3,B00005LP3M,"not a total waste of time, but mostly unreal story with way too many holes. some of the holes were amusing: the guy who comes out and pumps gas at a quik-mart. when did that EVER happen? dropping a dead body out a window in broad daylight in the middle of 2 dozen windows in an office complex - and not a soul notices. a classic car doing a full smashup and not suffering a single ding while the police totally stop looking for the car. an enormous hole in the lady's dressing room and not one woman notices chester the molester ogling the T&A. the undiluted absurdity of the film is what kept me hanging on; something not unexpected from cheese actor madsen. hopper clearly needed a mortgage payment. and that finale------gad!",1509494400,,727,4.473684210526316
7944195,2,B00005LP3M,"This movie seems ""early"" Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen. Surely, they became movie stars because they ""developed"", they improved, worked with better directors etc. Made for DVD release sixteen years ago, so there you are.",1509321600,,223,5.4
