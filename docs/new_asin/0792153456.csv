122064,5,0792153456,"i was very afraid to buy this dvd because all the description said was that it was ""widescreen"",the producers would not specify what the exact ratio was,i took a chance and it payed off,the ratio is not the annoying 2:35 to 1,(where you lose 2 inches of veiw at the top and bottom of your tv screen),the dvd plays with a very slight black border of 1/2 inch at top and bottom of screen,(probably the very enjoyable ratio of 1:85 to 1), someday the studios are going to wake up and give the public the choice of seeing classic movies such as this the way they want,(such as they did with the release of ""thats the way it is"",one side of the dvd full screen,one side 2:35 to one),other than this comment,i agree with all the other reviews, king creole was the classic elvis movie for me personally!",986601600,3,796,4.385135135135135
122065,4,0792153456,"To a lot of critics and non-fans of the Master of Song or King of Rock 'n' Roll, to give him his correct title, Elvis Presley was merely a wooden celluloid freak who just sang to children, animals, and everybody's Grandmother on a movie set. That might have been the case during the mid-'60's when Elvis didn't know how to perform on a movie set any other way than to follow the less than mediocre script which was getting more tedious and morose as the previous one. This trend was set by the formula that started with ""G.I. Blues"" and finally reaffirmed with the classic, ""Blue Hawaii"", from then on in with the exception of ""Flaming Star"", it was a pretty poor rag-bag bunch. However, ""King Creole"" was Elvis' jewel in the crown. The film is a testimony to a time when rebellion amongst teenage life was coming to the fore and the struggle for a young person's  individuality in society was a constant threat to many parents of the 1950's genre. If Elvis was to be a big movie star this is the one that certainly went a step further than ""Jailhouse Rock"" to ascertain that position. Elvis' acting improved over the three film period of 1956-57, and in ""King Creole"" you can see the transition. He brings to the screen all the grittiness, excitement, tension that his character, Danny Fisher, is all about. This great quality DVD really pays justice to a classic piece of film making by Director Michael Curtiz and a great supporting cast that Elvis gained so much from performing with in this story. Another transition also happens in this DVD and that is one of the music. Apparently, Elvis never really liked Jazz music, but he certainly forgot all about that when he cut the soundtrack to this movie. I'm sure that Jazz music featured slightly higher on his list after he realised what he could do in the studio with this kind of music and blending it with his own rock rythmns and blues orientations. To me, this is one of the greatest films ever made, by one of the most underrated actors of our time. To the critics and non-fans alike: Watch it and Weep!",969753600,11,2063,4.53083109919571
122066,3,0792153456,"""King Creole"" from 1958,(the same year Elvis Presley was  inducted into the U.S.Army),is a good drama with a few good musical numbers  thrown in. Shot in glorious black&white and produced by Hal Wallis,who  produced some of Mr. Presley's biggest hits(""Loving You"" from  1957,""Blue Hawaii"" from 1961,""Girls! Girls! Girls!"" from  1962) and directed by Michael Curtiz(the classic  ""Casablanca""),the story takes place in New Orleans and Elvis  stars as Danny Fisher,a disillusioned high school drop out with designs on  being a singer. Danny gets a job at the night club ""King Creole"".  The picture features a fine supporting cast including the late,great Walter  Matthau,very effective as a sleazy gangster,Carolyn Jones as the gangster's  kept woman,Dean Jagger as Danny's father,Vic Morrow as a hoodlum and one of  the gangster's henchman and Dolores Hart as Danny's girlfriend,(Ms. Hart  after making several movies left acting and decided to become a nun in the  mid '60's).Elvis's top ten hit single from this movie was ""Hard Headed  Woman"".Also, ""Trouble"" was a well known number. Elvis Presley  had said in interviews that of all the 30 odd pictures he had made Danny  Fisher in ""King Creole"" was his personal favorite film  role. And,Mr. Presley added that he hated most of the rest of the pictures  he had made.",966470400,19,1317,5.185714285714286
122067,5,0792153456,"""King Creole"" was only one of a handful of movies that Elvis did that really showed his acting ability. A great supporting cast and songs that actually fit the scenes, showed that Elvis had what it took to be a  great dramatic actor. This movie is a must see. You won't regret watching  it!",949363200,4,290,4.351851851851852
122068,4,0792153456,"Even the stuffy New York Times praised Elvis Presley's performance in ""King Creole,"" and why not?  Everything clicks in this adaptation  of Harold Robbins' novel, ""A Stone for Danny Fisher."" For once,  Elvis has a good script, a terrific supporting cast, a first class  director, and a role worthy of an actor which he shows himself to be while  also singing an album's worth of outstanding songs.  He's not the surly  creep of ""Jailhouse Rock,"" nor is he the bloated beach boy of  most of his 60's movies.  He's a good kid whose boredom with school and  disappointment with his homelife leads him to explore life on the wrong  side of the tracks where he encounters a switchblade flinging Vic Morrow, a  sleazy Walter Matthau, and a beautiful but been around Carolyn Jones.  Along the way, he also performs brilliant, knockout musical numbers like  ""New Orleans,"" ""Trouble,"" ""Dixieland Rock,""  and the amusing ""Lover Doll"" (no ""Old MacDonald's Farm""  in this movie).  It all adds up to the King's best film, one of the few in  which he wore his crown with honor.",928281600,17,1063,4.747252747252747
122069,5,0792153456,"As an avid Elvis fan I have to rate King Creole as the finest of all the Elvis movies. Elvis plays a juvenile delinquent on the verge between good and bad. When his father is hurt he chooses the bad in what he thinks will  benefit his dad. Wrong.
Here Elvis showed he had the makings of a real  actor. With a great back up cast this movie is a real must see.",923097600,,358,3.8904109589041096

122073,5,0792153456,"Elvis' last film before being drafted into the Army and before his mother died shows him as a natural actor with Brando qualities.

122092,3,0792153456,"I was unexpectedly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It is one of Elvis's early films, and you can tell he was really trying to be a serious actor, not phoning it in as a caricature of his real world persona like in some of his later films. It was a good balance of drama that you want to care about and excellent musical performances. Many films fail on this count and the music intrudes on the real life aspects of the plot. Not in this film. I would recommend this even if you are not a fan of ""The King's"" acting skills.",1472428800,,533,4.085714285714285

122273,4,0792153456,"Elvis Presley's fourth film, and last before entering the army, King Creole (1958) features the singer in a serious dramatic role, rather than the light romantic comedies he would soon become known for in the early 60's.  Set in New Orleans, and based on a story by noted author Harold Robbins (The Carpetbaggers), while amply showcasing Presley's singing talents, the film also provides the opportunity for Elvis to really display some acting skills, starring as a troubled young man sucked into a sleazy world of deception, crime, and violence.  For this tragic tale of troubled youth, it's not hard to see why James Dean (Rebel Without A Cause) was originally stated to play the role, before his untimely death.  While the plot might now seem clichd and predictable, this was pretty heady stuff back then.

High schooler Danny Fisher (Presley) works as a busboy at Maxie Fields' night club ""The Blue Shade"", to help support his father (Dean Jagger), and sister Mimi (Jan Shepard).  One morning while cleaning up, Danny helps a woman named Ronnie (Carolyn Jones) who he later discovers is the girlfriend of Maxie Fields (Walter Matthau).  Fields forces Danny to demonstrate his singing ability, which leads to his being hired by Charlie LeGrand (Paul Stewart), the owner of the King Creole night club.

Danny gets involved with a gang of hoodlums led by Shark (Vic Morrow).  During a robbery at a store, he meets Nellie (Delores Hart), and begins a friendship with her.  Danny's father gets a job at a pharmacy so that his son can finish high school, but winds up in the hospital when Shark whacks him on the head during a robbery.  Using Ronnie to persuade Danny to work for him fails, but with Shark's help, Field manages to get Danny to leave LeGrande's club.

The screenplay does a good job of involving a lot of characters, pumping up the drama, and bending Paul Fisher into a guilt ridden emotional pretzel torn between two completely different types of women.  The melodrama is laid on thick and heavy, but still plays pretty well mostly due to some strong performances.  Presley, along with Carolyn Jones, Walter Matthau, and Vic Morrow, are very good.

The weakest part of the film is the bittersweet ending, which considering the number of injured and dead, winds up very conveniently, with many questions unanswered.  It's nice to see Elvis Presley in a dramatic role with some substance.  The black and white presentation works well with the dark storyline, and dimly lighted streets and nightlife of New Orleans.",1319846400,,2527,4.896713615023474

Michael Curtiz directed this - one of the great noir filmmakers ie.,Mildred Pierce w/ Joan Crawford. I love his directing. He also directed John Wayne's 'The Commancheros'; and King Creole was his last film. Highly recommend this for your collection of early Elvis. A must have. Good for teens too.

If all of Elvis' material had been written this well, and if he'd been directed this well through out his career...well, it's already been said that Elvis could have been as good as James Dean.  Seeing this film makes you believe that.  You can find  that same potential in ""Jailhouse Rock"", ""Flaming Star"" (except for that scene where he sings, how out of place and stupid was that?) and ""Wild in the Country"" and a snippet or two in ""Change of Habit"" and, surprisingly, ""Viva Las Vegas"".  This was the one film of his where the director seemed to actually take him seriously and the music is high caliber all the way through without the dopey juice jazz that made up the last 20 of his films.  I rewind and rewind ""Trouble"" to see the way he lets his music take him and us to that fun place called WOW!!! Even people who aren't Elvis fans will like this movie.  My sister, who could never understand my enthusiasm for Elvis, finally agreed to watch King Creole with me and there after became a fan of his as well.  Between this movie and the ""68 Special"", you will have the Elvis that was worth watching and the Elvis that captures hearts still today.",1233187200,,1253,4.441048034934497
122295,5,0792153456,"That gorgeous smile shows up in the first scene. The black and white movie opens with fabulous footage of New Orleans' French Quarter in the '50s, with vendors singing of their produce--an historical practice. A woman on a mule-drawn cart sings ""Crawfish,"" and Elvis leans out a balcony window and joins in her song. As he sings, he ducks back inside and is viewed only through the sheer curtains, tantalizing his fans until the viewer is allowed into the apartment.

Elvis's favorite movie of his is mine, too. Good jazzy songs, good story, and yes, good acting by the young, trim Elvis. His lines were delivered without rushing them the way he did in other movies, and with an appropriate amount of emotion.

A few of the lines from the two needy women who loved him were a little melodramatic, but that can be overlooked, it's all so camp, cute and nostalgic, with a sweet song in a happy ending that brings tears to my eyes.

Written by Harold Robbins who also wrote _The Carpetbaggers_, ""King Creole"" is heavy drama with some PG violence and adult themes but '50s clean.

Interesting note: Dolores Hart, who plays good girl Nellie, also appeared in ""Loving You"" and the first ""Where the Boys Are."" She left Hollywood and became a nun. Now a Mother Superior, she retains her membership in the Academy and votes each year for the Academy Awards, so I have read.

The supporting cast all give great performances, especially bad girl Carolyn Jones, her ""boyfriend,"" Walter Matthau as the villain, plus Dean Jagger as Elvis's father.

Elvis loved this movie and wanted to do more drama, such as Peter O'Toole's ""The Lion in Winter."" He hated the trite movies the Colonel pushed on him, hated that his wildly successful movies provided financing for good movies of less-received depth and drama he was not allowed to do.

""King Creole"" shows he could have done them well. And the singing, of course, is wonderful!",1220659200,2,1912,4.740963855421687

In this particular movie, Elvis Presley is grounded by two very fine accomplished actors, Walter Mathau and Caroline Jones. Their great presence in the film helps support Presley's character and gives him strength and a naturalness that doesn't always shine through in later films. Filmed at a time when Mr. Presley was young and appeared in very good health both physically and mentally, one can only just sit back, relax and be entertained to the fullest and not be encumbered by what followed Elvis Presley's life after this movie when the rumors of drug use and obvious ill health became all too noticeable.",1185321600,,834,4.8321678321678325

It is no secret that Elvis was most unhappy with the simple roles he was given only to use his voice and good looks...which made lots of money, but which left him disillusioned, dissatisied and unhappy throughout his motion picture career.

And here he is playing the rebel James Dean just like everybody was in real life. And that was what everybody wanted to see, the real Elvis, our Elvis. Only he was better than James Dean ""just because"" he could sing like nobody else. And if everybody wanted to act like James Dean also everybody wanted to sing and look like Elvis.

And since the story is set in New Orleans the music is Dixie, but since this is Elvis it turned out to be ""dixie-rock"" and it sounds great. All the songs are complete (unlike ""the girl can't help it"") and Elvis really rocks.  Sadly to me this was the last time I saw the real ELVIS.

Anyway, as a lover of EP's music, and at the time only his music, I was so so so very hesitant to ever give a film of his the smallest chance, because of all the negative things I had heard.  I didn't want a bad film to ruin the image that the music had created in my mind.  So it was 35 years of just music, nothing else.
Then this past April 2004 I was able to make a ""pilgrimage"" to Memphis, specifically Graceland.  While talking with an employee in one of the giftshops, she convinced me to give certain films a try, and King Creole was the one she recommended I start with.  She was kind enough to also recommend a few that I must avoid at all costs, namely Girls, Girls, Girls.
If I could meet this Graceland employee again, I would thank her several times over. King Creole is a quality film that has an actual, and quasi-believable, plot.  It has Elvis at his most handsome, and in black and white, that comes through even more.  He gives a commendable performance, and his costars carry their weight in the film well also, esp the beautiful Carolyn Jones.
I would classify King Creole as a good overall film, and in the Elvis realm, I would consider it a great film.  I think it is his best.",1084492800,,1238,4.238297872340426
122393,5,0792153456,"Finally Elvis really acts in this film,and you can tell he enjoys it. Great cast of actors and classic music. To bad he was given such bad scripts and songs later on.",1074643200,,166,4.21875
122394,5,0792153456,"The BEST Elvis movie which allows Elvis to show his true ability to act. The hospital scene is an example as Elvis is moving. Great lines from all the actors thru out the movie. Well written and directed. Film in New Orleans some of the background is still easy to find today.
 Classic songs, timeless love, great story and it is good for the whole family. They sure don't make em' like this anymore.",1043971200,2,400,4.405405405405405
122395,5,0792153456,"""King Creole"" is right up there with ""Jailhouse Rock"" and ""Loving You"". The director, Michael Curtiz, was reluctant at first to do this picture. He thought Elvis wasn't going to obey him and be rebellious. He, of course, was wrong, and Elvis was there at Curtiz' every command. Curtiz later thought that Elvis really was going to make it in Hollywood. Neatly crafted story originally intended for James Dean. This picture was saved even though James Dean died. The story was based on the novel ""A Stone for Danny Fisher"". If you're an Elvis fan, I highly recommend ""King Creole."" You'll love it!",1036108800,2,595,4.786407766990291
122396,4,0792153456,"Yeah, it's a little hokey - it's an Elvis flik!  BUT, this one is really a joy to watch.  It features Elvis at his best - his acting is strong, he looks fantastic, and the songs are great!!
I was surprised how much I enjoyed this - I watched it to hear the music, and be mildly amused, but I ended up quite engrossed and impressed!  If you want to see some quality Elvis films, this is one of them, along with Jailhouse Rock, Loving You, GI Blues, and Viva Las Vegas.  Definitely worth seeing for good music and Elvis in his prime.",1018742400,2,531,4.12621359223301
122397,1,0792153456,"This must have been Elvis Presley's worst movie. And when Mr. Presley was starting or doing this film, the army decided to draft him and Elvis Presley requested a 60 day brek to finish this movie, or it would have cost the studio a lot of money, if he had to leave the movie to go to the army. And Elvis Presley is cast as a high school student.
As the movie opens, Danny Fisher (Elvis Presley) is getting ready for what he thinks is his last day of school. And manges to sing his high school song for a gangster and recures his boss's (Walter Matthau) girl from the gangster. Her name is Ronnie (the late Carolyn Jones). And at school, he gets into a fight that sends to him to the princple's office, where his teacher (Helene Hatch in an uncredited role) decides that Mr. Fisher will not graute the following day. And so Danny, decides to not return to school for another school year. But when his father (Dean Jagger) finds out, he tells Danny to leave work to him, and Danny go to school. I giving it 1 star because of problems that I'm having with the film. Could somebody in real life decide to have a student, not to gruade? I must confess, I don't know.",1011225600,,1161,4.257918552036199
