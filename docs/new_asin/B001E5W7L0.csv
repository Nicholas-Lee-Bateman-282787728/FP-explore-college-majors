3545996,5,B001E5W7L0,A GREAT EVENT IN HONOR OF THE ETERNAL KING OF ROCK AND ROLL. PRODUCT SUPER RECOMMENDED. FANTASTIC IMAGE AND SOND.,1353888000,3,113,4.7
3545997,3,B001E5W7L0,"All in all it's a good 'tribute' but focuses way too much on country artists.  I mainly got it because I thought there'd be interviews included with Jon Bon Jovi and although there was an 'outtake music video' of Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora singing ""Always On My Mind"" with Willie Nelson in the bonus features, that is the extent of Bon Jovi's appearance on this show.  I was disappointed that that performance wasn't included in the actual tribute show, where as there was not one but two songs performed by Chris Isak.  I honestly feel that it had Priscilla's hands behind the production as from my personal observations, she has a preference for country artists rather than Rock and Roll.  Personally I would have preferred to watch Bon Jovi than half of the artists on the disk, but as a tribute to Elvis I suppose it's okay.  Certainly worth a look.

What would have made this tribute better would have been focusing on rock and roll entertainers instead.  Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Elton John, U2 are far bigger entertainers and yet we get people that no-one outside of the country audience has really heard of.  It could have been a lot better.

Of course there was a little Britney Spears, Rob Thomas, and 50 Cent and ""The Rock..."" aside from that it's all country.

Elvis is the KING OF ROCK AND ROLL!  When will we get a tribute to him by the Rock Greats?  Most of them are fans or appreciate his influence and music as it is.  Most big rock stars have admitted his influence on them or to being fans of the King.  Let's get some applicable tributes to the King!",1309996800,6,1579,4.494736842105263
3545998,3,B001E5W7L0,"I will unabashedly proclaim that I'm a big Elvis fan...I don't care if I'm considered ""cool"" or not by the ignoramuses that think of Elvis as little more than a fat clown in a jumpsuit. Any rock and roll music fan should know their stuff when it comes to the legacy of rock and roll and how it came about. To do that, recognizing the musical genius and pioneering spirit of the one and only Elvis Presley HAS to be acknowledged and appreciated. That is why I applaud the release of this documentary/performance DVD as an effort to wake people up to this realization about the King.

There are pros and cons to this video: the documentary segments and interviews with Elvis' associates (plus Priscilla) were both interesting and informative, but I thought most of the performances by various artists were kind of mediocre, although a few were good. I thought it was cool to see Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora performing with Willie Nelson on ""Always On My Mind."" I've always loved Willie's version of that song, but in this performance, as I expected, he rushed the words like crazy so that he wouldn't have to hold any notes. Maybe it's not his fault--maybe he just can't sing that well these days, as ol' Willie is, after all, getting up there! :-) A legend in his own right, for sure!

I was hoping to see some participation (both in the interview and performance contexts) from more legendary figures like Paul McCartney, who does make an appearance here performing a solo vocal/stand up bass version of Heartbreak Hotel, albeit a short version. Too bad they couldn't get some involvement with Mick Jagger, Robert Plant, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, or B.B. King, all of whom had more direct contact with and/or influence from Elvis. I don't see much of a connection with Elvis and the young female country singers featured here--maybe I'm wrong, but their interview segments sounded a little contrived. Are they REALLY Elvis aficionados, I wonder?

For those who really want a complete experience of Elvis at the peak of his Las Vegas heyday, I strongly recommend the ""Elvis: That's The Way It Is"" DVD, which is the concert/documentary video from which this DVD borrowed several clips. Get the REAL DEAL! Long Live The King!",1285718400,5,2230,4.742268041237113
3545999,2,B001E5W7L0,"This is a modern documentary about Elvis featuring performers who mostly weren't born yet when Elvis died.  It's actually pretty good but I thought I was buying Viva Las Vegas, the movie.",1244332800,3,187,4.84375
3546000,4,B001E5W7L0,"I purchased the disk believing it to be a Tribute to Elvis concert but it was just more of the typical praising interviews. Some nice performances included, I really liked Patti Scialfa and the ""Always on Mind"" by Jon Bon Jovi/Richie Sambora/Willie Nelson. Great picture quality on music sequences...",1240531200,8,300,5.142857142857143

8296580,5,B001E5W7L0,"If you are a music lover at all, you MUST buy. Can't call yourself an Elvis fan without this in your collection. Lot's of recent stars to entertain the younger crowd as well. Wish there was a soundtrack for it!",1490572800,,210,4.275

8296582,3,B001E5W7L0,"This MIGHT be good, but it's impossible to know since the DVD did not play in any of the four different units I tried it on from DVD players to computers. Possibly this format is not playable in the USA, though that would be most weird and should be stated by the seller. Even though this was not a great expense, it feels like getting ripped off, and I am returning it for refund.",1471737600,,381,4.162162162162162
