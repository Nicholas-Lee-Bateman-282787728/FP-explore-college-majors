5092693,5,B007K7IC5Q,"My son loves Hard Hat Harry b/c he is so silly. These are older films and the acting is very obvious from the kids. However, each as a good introduction into the subject covered by each film.",1353369600,,191,4.1891891891891895
5092694,2,B007K7IC5Q,"I bought this for my grandson.  Maybe when he is older I will take it out for him.  I think there is too much talking for little ones and not enough ""hands on"", visual stimulation.",1347321600,,180,4.114285714285714

8518856,3,B007K7IC5Q,"There were occasional things that were interesting to watch (once) such as the rodeo or the logging events.  But you'd have to fast forward through the many, many parts that are just talk or 'how-to' instructions, such as how to saddle a horse or look for fossils or plant trees.  Our 3 yr old was thrilled with the brief bit on dinosaurs but was quickly disappointed with the lengthy time spent on fossils - what they are, what they aren't and watching people walk around looking for them. Every section has a briefly interesting part then becomes just talk.",1460332800,,559,4.636363636363637
