2391432,4,B000ASDFHM,"I can't wait until the release of this DVD.  I am sure it will be totally awesome.  I have really liked the other two movies, and I was totally excited to hear about the third movie.  I think a TV series would be a great idea, like some other viewers suggested.  I also agree that it should be closed-captioned for the deaf.  The deaf should be able to watch this movie too.  Hopefully, they will either edit this movie or will make close-captioning for the fourth movie.  Anyway, I am sure this will be an action-packed Christian adventure for ages 8+.  Hollywood should really take a notice to these great Christian movies that are sure to be a huge hit.",1129507200,3,656,4.408333333333333
2391433,5,B000ASDFHM,"I was afraid they stopped making the movies.  I'm glad I was wrong!

By the way, the subtitles work the same way that closed captioning does.  They show the words that are spoken in the language of your choice.  You can chose to see them either from the main dvd menu or with the subtitle button on your dvd remote.",1129334400,4,315,4.2
2391434,5,B000ASDFHM,Yeah I also definitely agree with the last person who was upset..Wheres the closed captioned ?..Christian movies need to have that on all there dvds!--Its not a question of when! it question of now!(Closed Captioned is a must!)-Also this movie should be a wakeup call to Hollywood Christian movies are on the rise!--Now make a Left Behind Tv series! Remember Highway To Heaven?....,1128902400,,381,5.063492063492063
2391435,1,B000ASDFHM,"For those who are blessed with the power to hear, don't bother with this review.  If you are not so blessed, this DVD is yet another diappointment from Columbia Tristar Hom.  Yet again, Closed Captioning has been overlooked on this DVD, as it has been on all the ""Left Behind"" DVD's.  It is very upsetting to someone who has read the entire ""Left Behind"" series, started the prequel series, and even read ""Soon"" by LeHaye to know that with all the money that was made from the best selling Christian fiction series ever they are too cheap to add closed captioning for the deaf.  I rated this with one star, but how can you truely rate a movie you cannot ""hear"".",1128470400,11,661,4.43801652892562

I am prone to think that those who give it a stinky review just don't like the religious aspects.  I liked all three and have watched them several times. THey have action, suspense, good characters and good character interaction.
I mean, for goodness' sake: people still like THEM and GODZILLA and that requires a bit of suspension of belief.  You can watch these as believers or as someone looking for a compelling series. WOrks either way.",1441497600,,556,4.653061224489796

2391575,4,B000ASDFHM,"This is third and last of the Left Behind made-for-video movies.  It is about those that were left behind after the Rapture and all the horrors they had to face. This third tape is about the president of the USA finally getting it and realizing that the worst war of all times had just begun. It was a rough future reality. It was not for the faint at heart. I'm not sure I would allow very young children to view this movie, but I do recommend it for teens and adults. It is a well done depiction of the future based on the Bible.",1426809600,,531,4.105769230769231
2391586,5,B000ASDFHM,"This movie was well done and biblically correct.  I enjoyed it and it stirred me up to share my faith with unbelievers.  I no longer look at the rapture as a get up and go . . . . out of here moment.  Now I see it as a reminder that many people will be left behind.  The people who either refused Christ or I didn't bother witnessing to.  It's very convicting.  I've watched it many times and am not tired of it yet.  Oh, for the hotheads out there who are agnostic, atheistic, or simply easily annoyed by anything that doesn't go exactly with your own beliefs, hold your arguments. You can't make me feel inferior or in any way, wrong.  I'll simply take time to pray for you.",1425168000,,676,4.1461538461538465

2391595,3,B000ASDFHM,"Left Behind: World at War is a Christian apocalyptic/thriller and the third film that was based on the Left Behind book series particularly the novel entitled Tribulation Force.

In it,the countdown to Armageddon continues as the world leader Nicolae Carpathia brings peace to the world. U.S. President Gerald Fitzhugh ensures his country will not stand in the way of the historical peace pact. But when the President almost got assassinated,he realizes that Carpathia have other things in mind. With the future of world uncertain,President Fitzhugh decided to seek the help of investigative reporter Buck Williams' Tribulation Force to dethrone Carpathia before the what is written in the of the Book of Revelation becomes a reality.

The film was definitely filled with nothing but cheese and silliness particularly the story involving the President of the United States being able to stop Satan's plans for the world and being able to stop Rapture and the predictions of the Book Of Revelations to finally come into fruition. It is more of a action/science fiction thriller rather than a Christian film. But nevertheless,it had did have some moments in it.",1421971200,,1159,5.225806451612903

2391677,2,B000ASDFHM,"I was drawn to this movie mainly by the title and the actor Louis
Gossett jr.  To clear the air I was not familiar with the book of the
same name nor the authors other writings let alone the other
movies based on those writings.

The movie begins at a time after the story actually begins with a
narrative by the president of the United States while he video
tapes himself as the capitol is raised.  In the following scenes
there are obvious religious overtones that are common in many
films of this type that really don't fit well.  As the movie
progresses so do the religious overtones and the age old belief
that God will lead them and protect them is thrown at you.  The
story moves along at a nice pace and the inevitable happens, the
God fearing people are attacked and they retaliate.  What
hypocrisy!  I for one am fed-up with people trying to justify their
beliefs through the media under the guise of entertainment.  And
the worst of it is that whether it is Christian or radical Muslim
they justify killing others for the sake of a non-existent God.  The
fact is people kill people every day for the slightest reason.

For most viewers this movie is a waste of time and your hard
earned cash.  For the others, if you want to find a crutch to lean
on go to the nearest church.",1396224000,,1286,4.361344537815126

Left Behind:World at War in my opinion is a depiction of what our country is going through now being that God is being taken out of everything, such as natural disasters, incurable diseases, famine,etc. For those who don't believe in God's power,love and grace I highly recommend this series.

First issue had to do with the idea of poisoning the Bibles, while that was not in in the books, it is conceivable and a good plot device, but still that should not have been in the movie. The second issue has to do with that the movie starts in the end of Tribulation Force. If the Tribulation Force story is not finished, then this movie should Left Behind: Tribulation Force 2 or another title. But despite that it is a watchable movie, the special effects are better than the other movies and have improved, etc. That is my review, but don't just read and take it because of what I have said.

2391802,2,B000ASDFHM,"I wonder how the man behind the books and the movies could claim to be a Christian and produce this work. For the sake of full disclosure, I have not read the books but have seen all three movies. If this were just a movie, it would be the best one. The problem is none of these movies are just movies. And I am sure the man responsible for them has made a lot of money. The most stand out problem of this work revolves around one of the main plot points, a pestilence unleashed by the ""Anti-Christ"" character who is fully in power during this the third and last movie. Kirk Cameron and his crew decide to stockpile a vaccine because they supposedly in their Bible that pestilences will occur in the last days. It is true that pestilences are mentioned in the Bible as being around in the last days as a chastisement from God. Not as a bio-weapon unleashed by the Anti-Christ as depicted

The Book of Revelation while being prophetic is in large part about the punishments that will be handed down from God. Bottom line is that this and the other movies also deviate from what is written in the Biblical accounts a lot. Secondly the actors who portray the Christians lack any gravity in their roles. At best they must be either very naive in real life or follow what their pastor or minister says is truth rather than sitting down and taking time to read and understand the Bible.",1350259200,,1380,4.390625
2391803,5,B000ASDFHM,You must start with part 1 to understand what part3 is about. It's a Christian movie that deals with the Rapture and the evil that is here today. If you believe in Christ then you must see this movie............,1349654400,,211,4.435897435897436

2391806,4,B000ASDFHM,"I find reading the reviews for Christian materials (notably on Amazon, but elsewhere as well) to be exercises in frustration at times.  There are those who post ""reviews"" who never saw the flick or read the book or whatever, and are purely posting what is, by definition, ""hate speech"" directed against Christians.  Then there are the folks who actually did watch/read/etc the item and who didn't care for it on some legitimate basis (few and far between, but the only critical ones really worth reading, in my judgment).  Then there are the ""fanboy"" reviews which go unreasonably over-the-top in praising something which may be good but may still have some flaws...  but you'd never guess it from those reviews.  And then there are the ""flowers and rosiness"" reviews from people who hate to have to THINK about matters of faith, and only want ""happy-happy-fun-time"" religion, and who are often negative towards materials which involve actual intellectual challenging of their staid, settled, comfortable ""belief traditions.""

In my case, I'm a believing, practicing Christian who recognizes that all materials, including Christian materials, are subject to flaws and defects and HONEST, FAIR critiques are entirely appropriate, but childish taunting or mindless ""fluffy thinking"" are not.  I find all of the above equally annoying, as a result.

About this movie...  it's a pretty decently done flick.  The special effects aren't anywhere near the level of a Hollywood blockbuster, but it's clear that this is where they were trying to go with this film.

The film takes a small section of time, spanning the end of the one book and the first section of the next book, and ""fills in the blanks"" in ways which are entirely consistent with the books..  with one minor exception and one major one, both revolving around the deaths of characters.  One minor character died (of suicide) in the first book but didn't die in the movies, so that character dies early in this movie.  The second character I'm discussing (attempting to be spoiler-free) dies of a disease in both cases, but in one case this character dies in a hospital, and no one knows exactly how he died, though poisoning is suspected, while in the flick this character dies of a similar situation which becomes much more widespread and is a major plot point in the film.

Excepting those two deviations, the rest of the film is entirely consistent with the books, and ""could have happened"" in the book universe as well as in the movie universe.

Of course, the movies and the books are not consistent in many other areas...  which is just fine.  This movie is actually a bit more ""conformant"" to the books than the prior too, as far as I'm concerned...  as, at the end of this film, both universes have essentially converged into one common scenario.

This movie stands quite well on its own.  It's a bit more ""action/adventure"" than the prior two, but this is entirely consistent with the novels, which do have quite a bit of that sort of thing in them.  It would be hard NOT to put that sort of thing into stories intended to be consistent with Christian eschatology (""end times beliefs"").  While I personally believe that the authors of the book series got a number of things significantly wrong, they never claimed to be writing historical documents...  they were writing NOVELS, after all.  I doubt very much that there will be some blonde, blue-eyed European ""Nicolae"" nor will the Antichristian world region be what they promoted in such an almost ""funny"" way.  I think that the real Antichrist, and the real Antichristian faith, will be something many of us are already familiar with (hint - watch for the restoration of the Caliphate once Assad's Syria falls).

SO...  for anyone who thinks that they're watching ""what's really going to happen,"" as if this were prophecy...  put that out of your mind right now.  This is FICTION, but fiction with a message, and fiction that is intended to provide some basic instruction to believers (and potential believers) about how to deal with whatever really DOES happen, even if it's not quite what's seen in the books or in the films.

Resistance, both on an internal (including but not limited to spiritual) basis, and on a physical basis (which may, if things get bad enough, require the sort of paramilitary activities seen in this film...  and if you believe in Christian eschatology, you have to know that at some point things will get that bad, and will continue to get steadily worse) is entirely acceptable.  Giving in to evil, ""going along to get along"" and the like...  that's what this movie is intended to strengthen your resolve against.  The character of President Fitzhue (Louis Gossett Jr, in an EXCELLENT performance, frankly) is the one who starts off ""going along to get along"" and who learned, apparently too late, what this really means...  but who learns the truth, and takes a strong stand, at the end.

Yes, the ending of the film doesn't result in the ""good guys beating the bad guys"" entirely...  it's a minor victory in a war which is destined, at least for the moment, for the ""bad guys"" to win...  but we know that the ""bad guy's victory"" is going to be very short-lived.

Many of us believe that this is all coming to a real head shortly...  that a global government is being established now, that freedom (including freedom to practice our faith as we choose to, or choose not to, without governmental interference, but also including many, many other elements not directly related to faith or to religion - which are, by the way, not the same thing!) is being taken away, and that for the first time in human history, every element of prophecy is coming together.  There's no longer any need to ""stretch"" or to ""read in""...  you can take things very literally and see all the signs right now.

These movies, and the books upon which they are loosely based, are to be taken, at most, as allegorical...  as ""fables"" intended to teach certain lessons.  The lessons are directly applicable to what many of us will likely have to live through for real in the not too distant future.  But it would be a mistake to treat them, and this movie in particular (since we're reviewing this movie in particular) as anything beyond that.

It's a thriller/drama with allegorical, rather than prophetic, overtones.  Watched on that level, it's a good, decent quality movie, rating a good solid ""4 out of five"" stars.",1334966400,,6444,4.819836214740674

This DVD is very specific drama alone the lines of the Left Behind book, and a what happens next i.e. the days after. Good acting and interesting good to watch with some popcorn on a Sunday night.

Another idea is Final Events, which is more encompassing, its not a drama, but a docudrama with a wider range of compelling facts and news reports of the Antichrist and the false god.

Both are great DVD's, Bless both of them, and each of us!

2391870,5,B000ASDFHM,"Left Behind: World At War is the third movie adaptation to the hit book series Left Behind. Instead of making a movie based around book 3 in the series (Nicolae), this movie is based on the last 40 pages of Book 2 Tribulation Force. It is mostly about the uprising and military action against Carpathia from the nations of U.S.A, Great Britian, and Egypt, let by President Fitzhugh. Its a great movie with plenty of action but also, for the Left Behind addicts there is the meetings of the Tribulation Force. Great movie for those who enjoy the Left Behind Series!!

As best I can make out, a reader of the original book or viewer of the other films in the series. I have done neither and found the film, oh, let us say, rather pointless, overblown and ludicrously pious.
Of course, my hypothesis as to those who would enjoy this, may be entirely erroneous and my judgment simply poor taste. I put it down simply to indicate to some innocent potential viewer that not everyone was enamored of the film",1241913600,3,604,4.353982300884955

2391879,4,B000ASDFHM,"Bottom line .. I found watching this a second time cured my aches from the first attempt. Just so you know, I grew up in church and have a strong faith which will never die. I really like and support Cameron for his faith journey and getting Lou Gosset Jr. involved was a coup. Besides, I""m a fan of the books so I'm certainly a reasonable source for constructive criticism.

The first time watching the movie it seemed this was more of a sermon and testimony then an action/drama/thriller with an underlying testimony the books were meant to be. I found myself distracted with so much emphasis on testimony since I already have a strong faith.

So, I watched it again after walking away for a little bit. The second time I really liked the movie. I enjoyed seeing the original actors returned. The action and drama was very well done. Besides the action and intrigue, one thing I enjoy is watching the transformation in the characters as their faith journey changes and strenghtens. But I like the subtle change and not a preachy approach. I look foward to Hattie's change in the future and I liked the unselfish heart of Amanda.

So, I would recommend this movie. In fact when I get done finishing this review I only did because Amazon sent an email asking for it, I'm going to go watch it again. : )

I have several reasons for saying so, and none have to do with the similarity, or lack thereof, with the books.

I've never read the books.

This film is an out, and out, Action film with a mission.

It is bringing home, in a very strong fashion, that whatever comes next in the series ain't gonna be a walk in the park.

While Buck, and the other Christian characters, are strong characters portrayed nicely by strong B-Level Actors the nature of the story, and of the growing power, and menace, of the character powerfully played by Gordon Currie, demanded an A-List Star with the Gravitas to sell the violent nature of the tale.

You have to remember that this is Low Budget Filmmaking ( Though they obviously spent much more money on the ""Boom!"" this time, as well as on Gossett.  ), and that plot choices are made with the number of actors the budget would allow.

This film belonged to Lou Gossett Jr.....

Gossett does a steller job of making us believe in all his character does as he learns an awful truth, and makes various decisive choices along the way.

To say more would spoil the enjoyment of a very interesting film.",1165622400,2,1280,4.5021645021645025

Heavy-handed, nauseating peddling of the idea ofthe rapture and self serving evangelical Christian messages flood this move so much that it limps along from one scene of hackneyed dialogue to another.

We ended playing a game of guessing the next line by stopping the DVD and making a guess, most of which were predicted. This will be the only way you will be intellectually challenged in this film.

One can only assume that Louis Gossett Jnr was offered large amounts of cash to appear in this film or was participating as part of some kind of punishment.

Even when the plot doesn`t match the books, the whole thing was interesting.

I'm afraid the movie separates from original idea for the sake of made film more attractive, adding awsome Lou Gosset Jr. who plays a role that in the book doesn't transcend.

However, this 3rd Movie in the series moves right off the storyline in what would appear to be a blatant effort to give a famous movie actor the starring role.  A role that was never to the fore in the books.  Even the title is off from the series.

This is a good movie, as movies go.  It may well be the best film of the 3 for entertainment value and also made me question some of my own Christian attitudes.  But I feel that if I were not a Christian, the message may have gone over my head.  People need to act now and accept God into their lives as they may not get a last chance.  If your life were to end today, are you sure of where you would spend eternity.  If not, it's time to accept the Lord Jesus into your heart and accept his love and forgiveness.

2391906,5,B000ASDFHM,"You ask if this (Tribulation) is true, than why bother being a Christian , you can live how you want and then get your 2nd chance in the Tribulation after the Rapture. Well, I assure you, a 'pre-trib' rapture is by FAR the most believed of the three (incl. mid-trib rapture or no rapture...just the Second Coming) The most blatant,obvious proof in scripture of a pre-trib rapture is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves. Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.(NLT)

 There is a very good reason to accept Christ NOW before this happens . God promises tomorrow to NO ONE. If anyone that hasn't accepted Christ should die tonight, there IS no second chance, they'll spend eternity in hell and then the lake of fire(unbelievers judged at the Great White Throne Judgement will be cast with Satan into the lake of fire..Revelation 20:11-15) after Christ's 1000 year reign on earth. Even if you choose to deny Christ until after the Rapture and intend on turning to Him during the 7 year Tribulation, it won't be a picnic. Christians will be persecuted and hunted down day and night and be killed, most likely beheaded for their beliefs. The worst of the years will be the final 3 1/2 years which will culminate with Armagedden. As God said in 2 Corinthians 6:2 TODAY is the day of salvation"" I'm looking SO forward to that  day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation.
 As far as this movie or the first 2 Left Behind movies not being anywhere near the books, WHO CARES?  The POINT is getting the Word out there and save as many people as possible while there's time , whether through the books OR movies, it's the MESSAGE that counts!  Praise God!",1150934400,4,2050,4.557065217391305
2391907,2,B000ASDFHM,"I have read all twelve books in the ""Left Behind"" series and this movie has very little in common with those books. As others have mentioned, the movie uses the same names and many of the same characters as the other two movies, but it is far from the story line. For example, the books NEVER that I remember had even a small section written from the perspective of the president, yet in this movie, the president is the main character. Also, what is with the vice-president being killed next to the car while the president was on the other side of the car and still survives? Or, on a wider basis, what is with the attack on the president, and especially the phantom motorcylists? That whole section is completely ridiculous.

In my opinion, the worst part of the movie is the parts with the virus. The book had nothing about the GC producing biological weapons and especially nothing about Carpathia contaminating Bibles with a virus. Anyway, before the cause of the virus is determined, Bruce (who happens to be played by a different character which makes it a little confusing) and Chloe catch the virus. Before Bruce dies, he askes to be served Communion. Before he can drink the wine, he dies. The rest continue on after a few moments, starting with Chloe. When Chloe drinks the wine, she is miraculously healed. Being a Christian movie, you would think that this would mean that God miraculously healed her, but soon after, Chloe calls Buck and tells him that the cure for the virus is red wine! That is ridiculous!

Another fault I have with this movie is the fact that the first time you are introduced to Amanda White is during the double wedding between her and Ray and Buck and Chloe. In the book, there was a short ""introductory"" period with some explanation of how she met Ray.

Overall, I do not recommend this movie. Even if you want to see all of the movies in the series once they come out, be warnd that this movie doesn't even pick up where ""Tribulation Force"" left off, and is rather confusing for a while.

In my opinion, you need to read the books to make any sense out of the movie, yet when you read the books, you find very little similarity between the books and this movie. So, once again, I do not recommend this movie.",1150243200,3,2248,4.502450980392157

I mean, the ending was indeed funny, i still cant figure out why the president becomes invincible at the end of the movie, and ends up being the main character.

2391909,2,B000ASDFHM,"I give this third installment at least 2 stars because of Louis Gossett Jr's acting. I mean how he pulled off some of the bad dialogue is beyond me but he looked good doing it. The rest of the cast doesn't even compare. And what is the deal with Charles Martin Smith appearing for 5 minutes in the beginning and getting killed? Like Louis, that guy can act. They should have kept him alive somehow because he would have helped this sorry film immensely. Fact is, I would have cast Charles Martin Smith as the anti-christ instead of the walking Russian stereotype they have now.

Overall I agree with the reviewer who said these films are the highest form of camp. But yet as laughable as the bible smuggling, bible poisoning and the antidote by red wine communion are (how come it was the blood of Christ and not his flesh, is one more potent than the other?) this film was still kind of dull.

The production values were much better. I'm sure Christians were thrilled by the SFX. But hey, if it's making money I can't blame them for following the evangelical formula as a business model. As a nonChristian this movie didn't convince me of anything except that they need a better script.",1144972800,5,1187,4.5162790697674415
2391910,4,B000ASDFHM,"I began reading the Left Behind Series a year after it first came out and devoured each book that came after it. The same now applies to the movies!

  Whereas, the first two flics (after the novel series by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye) followed closely with the book, in the interest of cinematic economy, situations has escalated seriously with the third movie. World at War begins in war-torn U.S. with defrocked president Fitzhugh {Louis Gossett Jr.} sitting in the ruins of his Oval Office, dictating a memo.

  ""....I can only hope that this is only a nightmare. That I'm not already dead, spending an eternity in hell.""

  Fitzhugh is a man in search of peace and is dragged, kicking and screaming, to the reality that the very person who preached this peace the loudest; Nicolae Carpathia {Gordon Currie} is the cause of the war that is currently plaguing the world.

  As for the believers, Bruce,Buck, Chloe and Ray ( Arnold Pinnock,Kirk Cameron, Janaya Stevens and Brad Johnson) are all but forced into hiding. ""If we confess to loving Christ, we're sent for re-education. If we lift a hand to spread His word, we're sentenced as TERRORISTS.""

  The two worlds meet when Fitzhugh's vice president is killed and the President is desperate to find out if the anti-Carpathia malitia are making Mr. Nice guy out to be a villian or is he, in-fact, the evil they are trying to defeat. Once the truth IS discovered, Fitzhugh realizes Carpathia must be stopped! But HOW????

  Without giving away the ending, watching Carpathia emerge, unscathed, from the wretchage of a bombed building is enough to make me practically drool over what's going to happen next! The Beast of Revelation has shown himself and I cannot wait to see what the producers have in store for his defeat! I already know what God has planned.",1143936000,2,1819,4.7756410256410255

Every one of these movies that I have seen, I have gone into with the same expectation: the acting is going to be hammy, the writing didactic, and the character motivation and plot is going to make no rational sense whatsoever (Communal wine cures the virus on the Bibles...OK whatever); at the same time I find myself smiling by the end.  That's because these movies are so bad, they're good.  If you like the kind of movies they show on MST3K and can stomach Kirk Cameron pontificating for an hour and a half to two hours (depending how many features you watch), this is a fun time for you.  Also high on the religious camp-meter: NBC's miniseries version of Noah's Ark.  Lord, I cannot believe how bad and yet how good that is.",1143590400,3,924,4.411764705882353

We care about them, and enjoy seeing what we've read and imagined 'come to life.'  As such, LB3 is enjoyable--though like many others, I'd say #2 was the best, thus far.

Viewers who have not read the books, or who have not seen the previous movies will be at a loss.  LB3 will seem disjointed and incomplete.  The acting will seem uneven, and at times down-right odd.  The most glaring example is when seductress Hattie suddenly becomes timid and resigned in the face of Captain Ray's wife telling her she understands, forgives and loves her.  Such a response was possible, but not plausible--and not on track with what had happened previously. The book series fills in the gaps, but the movie, of necessity, presents the change as just happening.

Bottom-line:  This is a pleasing film for Left Behind fans, but without the context of the previous films or the books, it will not flow easily or enjoyably for new viewers.",1139443200,4,1086,4.759358288770054
2391921,3,B000ASDFHM,"o.k..., first off, let me explain my title...yes, cloud ten has produced many fine Christian films(with 'Apocalypse',

'Revelation', 'Tribulation', and 'Judgement' being the finest among them), and, of course, the two 'Left Behind' movies, the best of which was the second one, 'Tribulation Force'...

but...when they take the most popular Christian book series and skew the storyline to fit a political agenda, then they have crossed the line...

Sure, this was probably written during the time when the country had that misplaced 'gung-ho' attitude towards the bush administration, which explains the horrible title, as well as the inclusion of such 'key' phrases, like 'weapons of mass destruction', 'biological warfare', and 'terrorists' (just to name a few)...

but now that the rest of the country knows what a few of us 'sainer' individuals knew all along (that the war was a complete scam, and that this administration is as crooked as a 'w'...), i have to ask myself, how they had the nerve to release this now...

but despite the obvious glorification of a now-distrusted nation, the big problem i have is that it doesn't follow the book...with a series like this, you don't mess around with the book, plain and simple...and simple explains the minds behind this particular travesty...

so why 3 stars?...simple...even though this is not 'of God', it still is 'about God', and for that, i can go no lower...it just would have been nice if the writers felt the same way, and didn't sink so much lower when re-writing this...",1139270400,3,1533,5.0395256916996045

I have watched the movies with my mother and she enjoyed them very much and she has passed the movie around her job and all the girls are just wondering if this is really going to happen just like the showed on the films. it makes them realize how close it all is and how short there time is. and if they want to live forever they need to except God into their lives.

Right from the start you'll notice much better and interesting dialogs, camera shots, action scenes, and a very intriguing story.

Though the movie's cliff hanger ending kind of left me unsatisfied, the story and the actings in the whole movie are so great that I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie to any person who'd like to watch a professionally done film with  creative insight on one of the most difficult books in the Bible to comprehend and interpret: The book of Revelation.

The acting has gone down hill from the first two movies, and the story is just not very compelling.  If you have not read the books or seen the first two movies, you will have no clue what is happeing in this movie.

2391929,1,B000ASDFHM,"Unfortunately, I don't share the enthusiasm for neither the books nor the movies many wish related more to each other.

However I do agree with one reviewer that the subtle Christian film, or the universal message is more appealing than the subjective interpretations of an explicit thought conveyed by the main characters more involved in group think rather than truth. Because to inquire about the truth leads one to the pillar, and that bulwark is the Church, the visible Church. Thankfully for 2000 years we have stood on that rock of authority versus our own fallible interpretations of an end which has led us to skip our beginnings and stunted our growth.

One does wonder however, how some can deny transubstantiation and then validate what occurs in this movie. Namely, that the Sacred Host was used to cure and all the while remained a 'symbol' of Christ's Body and Blood. Somehow, it must have been faith, and yet if faith was the only thing required, and the vessel of our Lord did not truly transform from a wafer, than the mere symbolic gesture is empty.

Hopefully this film will be another reason for Protestants to come home to 2000 years of authority and abandon nonsensical, subjective and recent 'theologies' about the end times.",1132876800,7,1249,4.854460093896714

I was real impressed and I feel that the actors were made for there role. The second was just as entertaining. Both movies followed the book true.

 BUT THIS...This movie was so bad I almost puked. Nothing followed the book at all. It seemed to jump forward on a couple of plot lines. AND (Spolier alert) THAT IS NOT HOW BRUCE DIED!

I did not see the true authors names nor was Clarence Gilard in the movie...and I can see why!!!

 Also the presedent was a part of the book but that was not the main story. To focas on that (which, I believe, was because of luis Gosset Jr.) was not right to the true book to movie line. If one is going to do the ""Left Behind"" series into movies DO IT RIGHT!! (See ""Harry Potter"", ""Lord of the Rings"",""Godfather"" etc.) There is still hope for this series as movies as long as the next movie (if there is one) is true to the book.

Kirk Cameron is no longer the child actor from ""Growing Pains."" Unshaven, and a little haggard, he sets the stage for World War III. This movie series is a great testimony to his belief in the storyline.

The movie also does a good job of setting the stage for a sequel. I recommend it as a witness tool as well. It's great for stimulating conversation with your unsaved friends and family.",1131494400,7,594,4.342342342342342

Well, I am serious when i say, this is one sorry excuse for taking my hard earned money, and at church no less. I went to my local Church premier and saw this poorly excecuted adaptation of a book that i rather enjoyed. Even, by book to movie standards, this latest attempt to bring the page-turning Left Behind books to the big screen left me feeling a little embarrassed to be there. I laughed outloud at certain points. I am hoping that someday there will be great values-based entertainment out there for intelligent adults, but this most certainly is not it. So far the best Christian movies have been ones with Christian stories, but not aimed exclusively at us such as Mel Gibson's unwaivering and lovingly crafted film. The only good thing that came from the widely publicized church premiers of this movie was the fact that they showed Angel Wars on a big screen concurrently for our children. They loved it, and i wish i had gone to see that instead. So it is not hopeless i guess. Original kids shows such as Veggie Tales and Angel Wars has proven you can make values-concious entertainment for Christians without watering it down, as it was most recently, in Left Behind - World at War.",1131494400,17,1460,4.640926640926641
2391933,1,B000ASDFHM,"I was really disappointed by this movie. The only thing in common with the novels are the characters which leads me to the conclusion that the producers were simply trying to cash in on the ""Left Behind"" name as much as possible. I think this shows a great deal of disrespect for the original authors. Nicholae comes across more like Darth Vader than the character developed in the books and all the characters seem very flat and 1 dimensional. The story begins with the double wedding of Buck and Chloe and Rayford and Amanda. If you hadn't read the novels, you would have been completely baffled by Amanda since this is the first time she's introduced in the film series. The movie moves from one event to the next without any real continuity and building to the climax. Unfortunately the story line from the movie series has moved so far from the novels that there is no way it can get back on track.
There is a very good presentation of the Gospel in a scene with Buck Williams and the President. Unfortunately, some of the other aspects of the film such as Nicholae (aka Darth) throwing the President out the window are so fanciful that I fear they could render the scene were the Gospel is shared as just another fictional idea to many people.",1130803200,10,1249,4.530973451327434

This is a story of what the world will be like at the time of the Rapture.  The story involves two men one a journalist the other a pilot and realizing that they were left behind and now they face the truth and must fight against the Devil or antichrist.  Super great book really pulled me in.  The movie take great liberties with the book and I found it to be very disappointing.  I would not recommend the movie but the Books YES! YES!!

2391935,4,B000ASDFHM,"In this 3rd installment of the ""Left Behind"" movie series, the earth teeters on the brink of World War III as a terrible virus is spreading throughout the world.  Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron), Chloe Steele (Janaya Stephens), and Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson) must figure out who or what is causing the plague and stop it before its too late.

Louis Gossett Jr. stars as President Gerald Fitzhugh, who has been in a close working relationship with Global Community leader Nicolae Carpathia, played excellently one again by Gordon Currie.  An undergound faction lend by the president himself, with assistance from Carolyn Miller (Jessica Stern) has been watching Carpathia's activities.  They soon learn that the virus is being transmitted by infected Bibles.  Many infected people have been flocking to churches seeking assistance from the plague.  Fitzhugh has also found out that Carpathia plans to attack the countries of the world with the weapons that they surrendered to him as a gesture of peace.

Amidst all of these activities, Rayford has married Amanda White (Laura Catalano), and Buck has finally married Chloe.  Unfortunately, one of the infected is Bruce Barnes, the pastor of the Steele's local church.

Racing against time, President Fitzhugh confronts Nicolae about his plans.  Using some unseen force, Nicolae lifts the president up and throws him out of a window several stories high.  Miraculously, he survives.  Soon, he is visited by Buck, who witnesses to him and prays with him.  With his new-found salvation and with the help of a small transmitter, Fitzhugh returns to Nicolae's office.  What will happen between Nicolae and President Fitzhugh?  Will the world survive?

I found this movie to be slightly different than the first two.  While the earlier movies followed the books very closely, this film deviated somewhat from the storyline.  I can't remember some of the instances, but some, such as Chloe being healed by the wine after accepting communion and Hattie Durham's (Chelsea Noble) attempted pass at Rayford did mesh with the books.

Overall, I did enjoy this film very much.  Although there is some deviation, the story is still good and the acting, led once again by Gordon Currie, is outstanding.  I highly recommend this movie.

The war just started, but they didn't go very far into it.  They could have continued with the war.  With twelve books in the series, they can't be doing one movie on only 40 pages of one book.

Nicholae and Buck never meet in this one. Nicholae has none of his staff from Tribulation force. Bruce Barnes death scene loses its value due to having to get a different actor than the guy from the first 2 movies. What happened to IVEY? no explanation! Where is Heim? Where is Ben Judah? Where is Bob Carlisle and his influence on the music? They are all gone. Slow dead mumbled movie with a few great special effects. I didn't wait all this time for Left Behind 3 to see special effects. This movie could have been so good. Best way to sum it up, It feels like a Lou Gossett Jr. movie with Buck and the cast as guest stars instead of the other way around.

So Terribly Sad as Nicholae would say.",1130371200,6,874,4.233532934131737
2391938,5,B000ASDFHM,"Based on the last fifty pages of ""Tribulation Force,"" ""Left Behind: World at War"" is the best film yet to come from a Christian film company. The new film looks and feels spectacular, and features inspired performances by an all-star cast! Lou Gossett, Jr. gives, without a doubt, his best performance to date as President Fitzhugh. Kirk Cameron's performance as Cameron ""Buck"" Williams is his strongest yet. The supporting cast does a fantastic job, especially Arnold Pinnock, who takes over the role of Pastor Bruce Barnes, and just nails it.

The writing is top-notch, and the visual effects, while not the greatest, are spectacular. And, most important of all, the message of Jesus Christ is presented clear, and precise. Those who hear the message of this film with an open heart will truly be amazed by what they see and hear.

The DVD for the film features great sound-and-picture quality, and the extras are fantastic. Any fan of ""Left Behind,"" or of strong supernatural thrillers, will want to add this one to their collection today!

Movie/DVD Grade: A+",1130284800,5,1063,4.96067415730337
2391939,5,B000ASDFHM,"The film opens with the President of the United States (Louis Gossett, Jr.) struggling with the events of the previous 7 days; 7 days that changed his life forever.  As the world embraces ecumenical religion and ecumenical government, the President fights to keep America a separate nation (indeed the heart of the Declaration of Independence).  Charles Martin Smith (""Roswell"", ""Starman"", ""American Graffiti"") makes a cameo appearance as the Vice President.  Many others have reprised their roles, except Clarence Gilyard (""Top Gun"") has not returned as Bruce Barnes, here played by another actor who also does a decent job.  Once again they tried to present the Gospel in the film in a clear way.

I recommend viewers new to the series be certain to watch ""Left Behind"" and ""Left Behind 2: Tribulation Force"" first to give the proper background to the characters and events portrayed in this film.  And it should be stated, the most significant Sign of the Times is not weather, but the reborn Nation of Israel.  Israel is the key focus in all End Times events of Daniel 8, 9, 11 and 12, Ezekiel 34, 36, 37, 38 and 39, Zechariah 12, 13 and 14, Revelation 11, 13 and 19, Isaiah 66, Matthew 24, Luke 21, Mark 13, 1st and 2nd Thessalonians 2 and many other Bible prophecies.  Jerusalem will be the Burdensome Stone, indeed the problem no nation can solve in the Last Days (Zechariah 12:1-3).

And the cinematography is excellent on the film, giving it a crisp feeling.  Kirk Cameron has taken on a new look which adds to his character's credibility.  The DVD offers the usual repertoire including subtitles of English, French and Spanish.  Although I generally agree with the End Times outline as presented in the books, I believe the End Times religious Babylon is not in Iraq, as presented in the film (see 1 Peter 5:13).  This is why the city is called ""Mystery"" Babylon in Revelation 17:18.  Tim LaHaye was involved in an excellent documentary called ""End Times in the Words of Jesus"" which is available on Amazon. Com in both DVD and VHS formats and is an absolute ""must have"" for anyone who has viewed the ""Left Behind"" movies.  Don't wait to add this movie to your collection as it very clearly lays out End Times events.  Also recommended are ""Israel, Islam and Armageddon"" released the month before September 11, 2001 and ""25 Messianic Signs in Israel Today"".  Both of these are available at Amazon. Com though the former not in the DVD version which TheBereanCall. Org offers (this writer has no affiliation with either).  These products will help put events into the proper perspective.

Anyone who doubts the ability to have a world-wide economic system need only look at biometric implants and scanners, grocery stores that have pay-by-scan of fingerprints, speedy pay systems by encoded devices and cards, RFID tags that tell distributors when shipments are misdirected or lost, vending machines and parking meters that accept credit and debit cards, etc. to comprehend that a system, as described in Revelation 13, is easily and technologically within reach in our lifetime.  Towards this end, the ""Left Behind"" films and books, while not perfect, are aimed at raising awareness to these things.  Read the statement of the week of October 26, 2005, by the Iranian president declaring ""Israel should be wiped off the face of the Earth"" and then read Ezekiel 38:5; an event that occurs after Israel is reborn as a nation (Ezekiel 34:13, 36:24, 37).  And Russia is actively providing nuclear technology to Iran.  This is not some fiction-based writing, these are real headlines in your daily newspaper and on TV.  And the land of Israel is divided in the Last Days (Daniel 11:38-39), by someone honoring a ""strange god"" and this dividing of Israel brings about Armageddon (Joel 3:2).  Seem preposterous?

2391941,3,B000ASDFHM,"I admit it's been a while since i've read Tribulation Force, and this movie is supposed to be based on the last 50 pages of the book, but after watching the movie you will see the only thing they took from the book is the names of the characters and the fact that a war happens. SPOILERS for those who have not read the book or seen the movie yet.

Bruce and many other Christians, including Chloe, get a deadly disease from planted Bibles that Nicolae has had sprayed with a poisonus mist. That is not in the book at all, i remember that much. Chloe almost dies and would have if she hadn't taken comunion. In the book, Bruce picks up the disease in some foreign country and Chloe's car flips, I don't see what would've been so hard about conveying that on screen. To screw up the story even more, President Fitsguh shoots Nicolae at point blank range and in return Nicolae picks him up with a force like power and throws Fitsguh out the window, 30 stories down. The president miracously survives and ends up returning later on, launching a missle directly into his office, destroying the whole GC office. I'm sorry but nothing like that happens in the book. What is this based on really? Nothing. I can understand why they did what they did, to make it more dramatic and emotional (ie. to have Chloe, Ray, and Amanda be with Bruce while he dies in the church) but it's not anything like the original story which would could have easily been conveyed on screen. The movies are not as dark as I remember the books being, the whole movie series thus far has had the agenda of getting the gospel message in there, and there's nothing wrong with that, but the movies seem less realistic and bogged down by it. the books presented the gospel well and with a good realistic story. Now my mom loved this movie, it's a lot different then the first two and i will admit, is a good story on it's own but they should not say it's related to Left behind. the only thing that connected me to the first two movies were the characters and the cheesy effects.",1130198400,37,2044,4.378947368421053

Kirk Cameron is an excellent actor, I really thought he brought Buck alive in this one. Everyone's acting was movie star quality.

The movie reminds me of the Terminator and has the same feel. Like Stephen King's ""Storm of the Centery"" same director. Excellent directing.

I have already purchased the DVD. I will purchase more of these to use as an evangelist tool in South America. I must have sent LEFT BEHIND the Movie 4-5 times already to PERU. I was glad to purchase them and support Cloud Ten.

Well, the best part is JESUS is mentioned as the the one true God-man who can save your soul if you repent. Finally, a film that is well made and put's forth the gospel unadulterated.

Thank God. Buy this film, see the clips on their website, then buy it. It leaves the pervious two films far behind.

The moment of the camera really makes you feel like your in the film. The Acting/Directing/Film Quality and the Gospel up front make this a truly great film.

God Bless guys -Excellent job!",1130198400,3,1169,4.511848341232228
2391943,1,B000ASDFHM,"Just wanted to let everyone know before purchasing this movie that the story of this movie series is completely different than the story of the actual book series.  The writers of this movie are only using the Left Behind book series as an inspiration, inputing their own ideas into the story, and changing major facts.  It's not just a little off, it's very far off from the original story line set in the books.  Check out the actual story of Left Behind by reading the books [...] .",1129852800,14,485,4.488636363636363
2391944,5,B000ASDFHM,"I just saw this movie at my church.  I thought it was a very good movie and gets the point across.  My only complaint about the movie is the way it ended.  All I can say is there BETTER be a Left Behind 4.  Kirk and everyone else did an excellent job in the movie.  I definitely recommend it to everyone.  HOLLYWOOD, WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS!!  I'm tired of all the garbage that's out there.",1129852800,6,396,4.064935064935065
2391945,5,B000ASDFHM,"For those of you that have been living under a rock the last few years, this movie is based upon the Left Behind novels and is the third installment.  Please read the entire series because no film can relay everything that the books have to offer.  Basically, the novels and the movies that they're based on tell a modern tale of the end times which can be found in the New Testament of the bible.  It's a fascinating way to retell the King James version of these events.  It puts things into perspective for us folks who live in the modern age.  Case in point;  The Rapture:  (for you folks that don't know the bible, it describes Christ's return to earth to collect the church) In the bible all of the Christians are removed from the earth and taken to heaven in an instant.  The bible says it happens in the twinkle of an eye.  Reading that in the bible doesn't necessarily bring to mind what would take place when that event occurs.  But in the original novel it is plain to see.  Drivers vanish while cars are in motion, airplane pilots disappear in mid flight, all over the world people vanish right before everyone else's eyes.  Planes fall from the sky, cars crash and everywhere you look you see piles of clothes where people once stood.

Get the point?  The movie brings these things to life so to speak thereby making the bible story much more understandable for many folks.  As a Christian this is a must see.  If you're not a Christian it's still a must see.  I just wish that there were a bigger budget for these films for higher visability.  I challenge George Lucas or Steven Spielberg to remake them.  Either of these guys could do wonders with them.  They probably wouldn't want to tackle the subject matter though given their own religious views.

Once you pick up the first book of the Left Behind series it's very difficult to put down.  Others have tried to novelize the endtime events but to date none have ever been as successful.  The series begins with the second coming of Christ to the appearance of the anti-christ, to his gaining power, to world domination, all the way to his ultimate defeat.  This series is a little difficult to describe because even though some might think so, it isn't fiction in the truest sense of the word.  It isn't fantasy (although some unbelievers think the bible is such).  It's futuristic only in the sense that it hasn't happened yet.

Even though this film is not a big budget item it is still well acted because the actors are dedicated to telling the story that others may never know about because they are not church goers or bible readers.  I urge you strongly to watch these films and explain them to your kids.  Your lives may just depend on it.",1129766400,12,2714,4.492842535787321

8079485,3,B000ASDFHM,"This movie makes a good faith attempt to be a faith based action thriller, and it does at best a fair job. Production values are radically better than most older faith based films, and the age of this movie is showing now. But even with its flaws, if you enjoy the other Left Behind Movies, you'll like this one as it completes the trilogy nicely.

I am somewhat annoyed at the price tag on this movie from Amazon especially considering it is only SD, and the other 2 movies are better, and free with Prime.",1508284800,,507,4.336842105263158
