8744802,5,B019D3J3E8,"An excellent documentary.  It contains crucial material needed for a well-rounded understanding of the UFO/ET phenomenon.  If you're a serious investigator interested in facts, this doc's for you.  If you want glitzy modern-Hollywood special effects, you might want to watch ""Independence Day.""",1466812800,,294,5.9523809523809526
