8187227,3,B000OY9VD4,"Wacky World of Tex Avery.

back in the day when this series was in sindicated TV, i thought the character Tex was annoying and wanted to see the other character more.

granted it is no classic Tex Avery but, for it time was doing the best it could for what it had.

just wish they would put it in a complete set.",1323561600,2,312,4.0
8187228,1,B000OY9VD4,"The cartoons on this DVD are ""in Tex Avery's style."" That is, they've used many of the tropes Avery did -- fast action, sexy women, (allegedly) goofy characters -- but managed to avoid anything resembling humor. The cartoons are annoying at best but more like painful to watch.

There are plenty of collections of Avery's ACTUAL work on this site and elsewhere. Don't waste time or money with this.",1287273600,,398,4.768115942028985
8187229,1,B000OY9VD4,"The old Tex Avery cartoons are wonderful.....this is not them!  I didn't read this carefully enough and thought it was the actual Avery cartoons. (purchased a bunch of cartoons that day, rushed it, my fault)  This is just some modern cartoon of the usual low end production, nothing like the original theatrical shorts of Tex Avery.  Very disappointed.",1269820800,5,352,5.0344827586206895
8187230,1,B000OY9VD4,"This is NOT the Tex Avery of the classic MGM, Warner Brothers, & Walter Lantz Cartoon fame.  This is a cheap TV show, released by DIC, ripping off the classic cartoon director's name and shamelessly using it for its main character & series name.
