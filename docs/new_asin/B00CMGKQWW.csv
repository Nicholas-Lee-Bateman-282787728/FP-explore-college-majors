8583434,5,B00CMGKQWW,"Saw this series on Netflix and went back to watch it again and it was gone. The Subtitles are ok you can tell that who ever translated did originally speak English, but I remembered what they were saying from Netflix. The packaging came in beautifully, unopened, unscratched. Love it!!",1461801600,,285,4.836734693877551
8583435,3,B00CMGKQWW,"I love this series, and I even loved it on Netflix, however the subtitles on the DVD leave much to be desired. Sometimes it is very hard to understand the meanings of dialogue because the subtitles make no sense and it is very detracting from the show. Other than that, I love the show and packaging was good. If you know mandarin then you should be fine. It is truly a great show.",1461369600,,381,4.232876712328767

8583439,5,B00CMGKQWW,"LOVE NOW is a seventy-two episode romantic drama that deals with the twists and turns of lovers who continuously misread the intentions of their partners. Connecting these lovers is a background of the interlocking complexities of the hierarchies of the Taiwanese family. Communal eating is the central metaphor that allows the lovers to play out their various angsts. Hardly a scene goes by that does not include the literal sharing of bread.

The primary pair of lovers is Lan Shi De (George Hu) and Yang Yi Ru (Annie Chen) who meet in the Philippines as she is tricked into taking an unwelcome vacation believing that she is dying of cancer. Her family and co-workers falsified a medical report attesting to her illness. They meet, fall in love, and marry. She soon learns of the false report and leaves her new husband immediately for Taiwan. The major plot impetus revolves his anger toward her for what he sees as deception followed by his regret and subsequent pursuit of her. There are many touching scenes of their courtship, many of which are played out at a dining table. Further, many of such scenes are tragic dealing with loss of a loved one.

Other paired lovers include He Cai Rong (Mandy Wei) and Sun Qiming (Bobby Dou) who take turns playing hard to get. A third pair is Zheng Yu-Xiang (Harry Chang) and Lan Shi Yun (Vivi Lee) who slowly fall in love despite Zheng Yu-Xiang's early hatred and revenge seeking toward her.  There are other paired lovers of course, all of whom operate in a cinematic universe that is totally distinct from any other. A surprising amount of dialogue does not seem related to advancing the plot. It took me nearly a dozen episodes to realize that what seems trivial scripting was really the director's attempt to do on the screen what Trollope does his in Victorian novels--to artfully slow down the pace of a frenetic lifestorm to the speed of ordinary life. In reality, much table conversation is trivial and I think it was the director's intention to force the viewer to look past the banality of quotidian life to unveil what each character wishes to reveal (or to conceal) but cannot. Many such table chit chat is truly covering a vast welter of emotions many of which foreshadow heartbreak. By the time you get to the grand finale, you have traveled along with the paired lovers to a point where not even nonstop banal conversation can be cavalierly dismissed. LOVE NOW is a magnificently paced film that astonishes even as it entertains.",1402185600,4,2491,4.761574074074074
