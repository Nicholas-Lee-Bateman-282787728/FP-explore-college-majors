All of the questions are British based and hard as heck, for example ""What year did Def Leppard's Pyromania album go to #3 in the UK charts""...Number 3?  Why?  Also, there are several typos and it is multiple choice and often times the same answer was listed twice on the same question.  There is an American Rock segment but it is so easy that a 4 year old could answer them.  I purchased this for my boyfriend's birthday party.  We were all thirty-something music buffs.  I was seriously disappointed.  So was everyone else.",1257120000,,590,4.490566037735849
