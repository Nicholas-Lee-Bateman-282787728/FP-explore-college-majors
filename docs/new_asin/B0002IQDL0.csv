8028143,3,B0002IQDL0,"same as the other movie

defiantly old style 3D conversion.
story is ok might be good for some kids but not all.
the 3D in this requires an active 3D tv, passive 3D will not do you much good (although some of this might look some what ok on a passive 3D tv).
also some might not be able to play the 3D in this cause not all 3D tv's have a wide compatibility of older style 3D. if you tv supports field sequential 3D it will work.
(as long as your bluray player supports 3D dvd's...might have to convert to sbs to get it to work)

y is this labeled 2 when the kid actors are younger in this than the 1st one?",1326585600,,607,3.8870967741935485
8028144,2,B0002IQDL0,Don't buy this movie even if you have kids.  The main reason is that this movie should have been the first one and the first one should have been the second one.  It also was pretty poorly acted.,1215475200,,195,4.105263157894737
