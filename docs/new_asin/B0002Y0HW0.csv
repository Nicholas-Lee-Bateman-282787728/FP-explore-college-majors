8489623,1,B0002Y0HW0,"I just opened the DVD, Hispanic Culture & People, to watch before taking to show students at school. It DOESN'T WORK at all. I paid $22.93 for just that one!!  I ordered three other DVD's's: The History Channel-Where the past comes alive -Hispanics in America and Travel to Peru DID NOT WORK. When I say ""doesn't work"", I mean just that. No sound, and just a still picture that is blurred.  Only one works-Hispanic Hollywood,Then - and - now. I am VERY disappointed.",1325548800,,466,4.602409638554217
