8589885,1,B00D6GAJEM,This is NOT a performance of the Mass as stated in the advertisement - the DVD is a live rehearsal and therefore a very different kettle of fish. You are thus selling material under false pretences.,1384819200,2,198,4.527777777777778
8589886,3,B00D6GAJEM,"An interesting documentary that shows the personality and unique rehearsal technique of Celibidache as he prepares his musicians for a performance of Bruckner's Great Mass No. 3 in the Basilika of St Florian, in Austria.  Alas that the producers did not (or could not?) offer the complete Mass performance on this DVD!  That is a disappointment, for certain.",1383264000,3,358,5.155172413793103
