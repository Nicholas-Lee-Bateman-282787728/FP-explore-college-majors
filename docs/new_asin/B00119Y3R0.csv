This video is mostly animated drawings that play along with a really bad audio. (and a lot of ""mysterious"" music)  None of the real pictures of the supposed UFOs are clear at all.  I have a UFO dvd library, but this dvd is getting thrown away.  I don't think any serious ufologist will find this video worth keeping.  Also, this video is so overpriced for the quality and content.  If you feel like throwing $20.00 away, then give it a try.  But, I honestly think you will be disappointed.  I don't like to give anything a bad review, but this video earns it.",1373932800,,699,4.195488721804511
