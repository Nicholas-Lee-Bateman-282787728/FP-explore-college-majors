6429509,5,B00KHSUAJG,"An absolutely outstanding spy film that surpasses anything I have seen in the espionage/suspense genre, including The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, The Ipcress File, and in my opinion the jewel of the James Bond series, From Russia with Love.  For suspense, it is far beyond anything produced by the venerable Alfred Hitchcock -- while long at nearly 3 hours, it is riveting, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting suspense that gains momentum as it rolls long, and you will hardly notice how long you have sat spellbound by this masterpiece.  This film showcases Hayley Atwell's considerable talent and in my view made her an unqualified and formidable star.  It is frankly outrageous that this gem of a spy film is still unavailable in the United States a full three years after its release.  I stumbled upon it quite by accident the one and only time it aired on A & E, to my incredible good fortune.  What is the hold-up in making this DVD available in the Western Hemisphere???",1426118400,84,975,4.779761904761905

6429511,5,B00KHSUAJG,"RESTLESS, the television adaptation of William Boyd's novel of the same name, was shown on UK BBC One and US Sundance Channel television in two parts in December 2012. The teleplay was nominated for two Primetime Emmy awards the following spring. Part one, the story of Eva's early life as a spy in the days leading to World War II, is beautifully filmed on spectacular locations in Europe. The cars used in the production are European vintage in beautiful condition. The costumes are interesting and appear authentic. The cast is superlative:
Sally Gilmartin...Charlotte Rampling (""Swimming Pool"")
Eva Delectorskaya...Hayley Atwell (""Any Human Heart"")
Ruth Gilmartin....Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey"")
Lucas Romer....Rufus Sewell (""Zen"")(Part 1)....Michael Gambon (""Dancing at Lughnasa"")(Part 2)

The story begins in 1976 in a remote part of England when Ruth (a long red-haired hippie working on her doctorate) and her son visit her mother Sally Gilmartin. Ruth finds her mother in great fear thinking someone is in the woods behind the house trying to kill her. Sally has purchased a rifle, binoculars, and a telescope. She tells her daughter she was a Russian girl named Eva that was a spy for the British in a clandestine group that offered refuge for German informants and recruited Roosevelt's help for British causes in WW II. Sally implores Ruth to find and visit Lucas Romer, the only one she trusts in the group, to stop the present-day killers; she gives her daughter her journal of her days as a spy.

Eva's journal begins in 1939 German-occupied France when she is recruited by spymaster Lucas Romer after her brother is killed by Nazis. She is trained at a safe house in a remote part of England. The film emphasizes that Eva receives no weapons training, so it is clearer that she is training to be a seductress. (At least, clearer to me in the teleplay than in the novel.)

The restaurant scene, one of Eva's first capers, takes place in Amsterdam when she and Romer, but primarily Eva, are to rescue a Dutch informant. The man gives Eva the wrong ""double password"" and Eva escapes through a bathroom window and witnesses the informant's death by several Nazi diners. The scene is vivid and well done...and shows Romer's early dominance over Eva's activities. (He's across the street in a hotel with a pair of binoculars!)

Romer, played by a handsome Rufus Sewell with a thin moustache, is not nicer than in the book...still an arrogant, rude man! He stays in the shadows at Eva's brother's funeral and during her spy training. The several times they meet, he is discourteous and does not treat her as a lady (although one of her fake passports is for a Baroness). Both Eva and Romer smoke continuously. Other men light her cigarettes...just not Romer. There is a strange scene where one of the group, an older man, calls Eva to witness a murder posed as a suicide at a crime scene before the police are summoned. Eva recognizes the victim as one of the directors of the group.

One can still wonder in the film, as in the book, why Eva and Romer became lovers. It happens suddenly with a kiss and then a seduction in a hotel room. If I recall, it's right after the restaurant caper. (As someone mentioned in my book club discussion...love happens fast in tense times.) Although RESTLESS is an adult drama, there is no profanity nor any bodily function or display in bad taste. Romer's sexual practice (coitus interruptus) is hinted at in the hotel room scene...but you would miss it if you have not read the novel.

The first part ends when Eva is assigned to go to Washington, D. C. to persuade America to come to Britain's aid in its war with Germany. Her specific assignment is to seduce the aide of Roosevelt's personal assistant Harry Hopkins. Previews of the conclusion show her as a blowsy blonde.....

Stay tuned...",1405382400,53,3845,4.834346504559271

6429514,5,B00KHSUAJG,A quality movie. I was attracted to it because of Michelle Dockery and Charlotte Rampling who are both excellent. I am not crazy about movies that shift back and forth in time (the 40s and the 70s) but it worked in this one.,1516060800,,224,4.232558139534884

Charlotte Rampling has never been one of my favorite actors but this part was WRITTEN for a personality such as her screen persona usually is (dull, lifeless, IMO) but as a retired spy who escaped everybody on both sides by the quick thinking wit only a BRILLIANT mind could manage, she was SPOT ON. What a great drama, and with so many twists and turns (some of them foreseen, some not) it made for a marvelous afternoon of spellbound movie watching.

6429528,3,B00KHSUAJG,"Very enjoyable until the conclusion. The explanation of events at the end is too ridiculous to be believed, and will only appeal to people who like  convoluted British mysteries like Midsomer Murders or whatever. Plus, the ending looks like it was cut short, as the role of the ex-boyfriend seemed to be going somewhere and then this character just disappeared. (I thought he was going to kidnap the grandson at the end.) That being said, the 1940s and 1970s settings are very authentic, Hayley Atwell is beautiful, and all of the roles are well acted so it almost makes up for the letdown at the end.",1497830400,,601,4.669811320754717

6429543,5,B00KHSUAJG,"It is amazing how well Hayley Attwell fits into 1940s-era storylines. She was outstanding in Agent Carter and again here in Restless. That is not to say she cannot portray present day women, she definitely cansee Conviction. In Restless she portrays Eva Delectorskaya a Russian turned British citizen spy working with Lucas Romer (Rufus Sewell (Pillars of the Earth, Man in the High Castle). In her later life, where she is known by her English name Sally Gilmartin (Charlotte Rampling, ""Swimming Pool, The Duchess), she must confess her espionage life to her daughter Ruth (Michelle Dockery, ""Downton Abbey). The four-part three-hour series has many twists and turns along with way, including Ruth having to forge a meeting with the now older Lucas Romer (Michael Gambon, Harry Potter films). This is definitely one of those show where you need to pay attention as if you look away for a few seconds you may miss something that becomes important later on. This review is from a digital version of the BBC drama. All in all an excellent spy caper with an outstanding cast.",1479600000,,1072,4.928176795580111

6429546,5,B00KHSUAJG,"I am surprised several people seem to have hated this miniseries.  We think it was excellent.  If I were to fault it, it would be for casting Charlotte Rampling as the elderly Eva --- the young Eva (Atwell) was warm, emotional, and also had brown eyes, while Rampling played a fairly cold, distant blue eyed woman.  They just did not fit.

But the plot was good, the acting was excellent as well as the time period reenactment.  Highly recommended.",1475366400,,448,4.620253164556962
6429547,1,B00KHSUAJG,"This was such a disappointment.  Story that made almost no sense with plot jumps that were absurd, terrible dialog and most of all a pace that was just very slow and boring. There were mistakes all over the place - obvious British train and train station supposed to be in Wash DC., Manhattan street scenes that looked nothing like NYC, people mispronouncing names like ""Allegheny,"" etc,  drove us crazy.  Big waste of Rufus Sewell after thrilling us in ""Zen.""  Hayley Atwell wasn't bad, tho uneven, but the actress from Downton Abbey was as one-note and annoying as she is on that show.  Don't waste time on this one.",1474156800,2,618,4.685185185185185

6429549,1,B00KHSUAJG,"Because of its outstanding cast and WW II spy genre, I really wanted to like this mini-series. It was disappointing mostly due to an unimaginative and predictable script, and equally uninspired directing. As a result, he mother-daughter relationship was only partially realized, and the motivations and reactions - she is more acted upon that being given much initiative - of the main character were either improbable, unstated, or opaque. I can't recall such a good cast being so poorly supported.",1472774400,,498,5.2375
6429550,4,B00KHSUAJG,"Enjoyed watching this, since we're WW 2 fans.  However, it was a little distracting at times as they flipped from the 1940's to the present.  Good adventure, interesting theme.",1471219200,,176,5.0344827586206895
6429551,5,B00KHSUAJG,My teens picked it out at the library because they love the main actress who is also in Agent Carter.

6429556,4,B00KHSUAJG,"This 'film' for TV, deserves all the credit  heaped upon it by the appreciative viewer's here, so there isn't any more positives to add. BUT--I do have a negative, which unfortunately--is becoming more frequent in such story lines these days. I'm referring to productions that include many time changes, or flash-backs. I find it very irritating when --whoever's job it is' ---to hire actors, to represent a younger or older version of a character, who bears no resemblance what-so-ever, to the 'present' version. I appreciate that perfection is almost impossible, BUT--in many cases, there doesn't appear to have been ANY attempt to find a reasonable likeness between character ageing--AT ALL. Sadly, this otherwise excellent 'film' , is noticeably marred in this way, by a poor and shoddy attitude. I have to add other gripes, because such a great story deserved better. There are many errors and faults in the production. There are two cars that were not even made during the war years. Most obvious for me, as a Brit, is the Triumph Roadster ( Red) in the desert scenes.produced between 1946--1950. The pale Blue US convertible was also post war. A Motorbike showed 1970's number plates, US flag with wrong number of Stars. The crossing of the border tween Canada and US shows a Mountain range in the background; there is none there,This is an otherwise first rate story.  P G Croft  UK",1465344000,2,1390,4.931623931623932
6429557,5,B00KHSUAJG,"Great story ! I viewed it on the big screen and was able to find a DVD copy through amazon. A haunting tale of intrigue as the retrospective life of a British spy is examined as the result of a perceived plot against her. Acting is superb and the authenticity of the circumstances seems to be recreated as they might have occurred. It was a very entertaining movie, I admit that I did have to watch it a second time to understand the intricate details of the story, but it was enjoyable on both occasions.",1465257600,6,505,4.326315789473684

6429559,5,B00KHSUAJG,excellent,1462924800,,9,9.0
6429560,4,B00KHSUAJG,"I liked it, but it's an odd one, and the more I've thought about it since seeing it, the odder it seems.  I've come to the conclusion that it's ""about"" PTSD, but you'll have to see it through (three hours, but not at all boring, and originally a 2-part BBC mini-series) to judge for yourself whether my view of it makes any sense.  It's very cleverly structured, for it's telling two stories about 30 years apart (as was also the case in the William Boyd novel on which it was based) and to the credit of the director Edward Hall, the lines of plot are kept very clear.  The movie, set in the 1970's, begins with Ruth Gilmartin (Michelle Dockery), a single mother working on a Ph. D. in History, visiting her own mother, Sally (Charlotte Rampling), who amazes her by telling her that she expects an attempt to be made on her (Sally's) life.  By way of explanation, she gives Ruth a manuscript  that tells a narrative of her life during the Second World War.  Her real name is Eva Delectorskaya, and she worked for British Intelligence, having been approached to do so by the agent Lucas Romer (Rufus Sewell), after the murder of her brother, who had himself been an agent unknown to her. The younger version of Sally/Eva is played very creditably by Hayley Atwell.

The ""early"" story, we're to understand, is what Ruth learns from the manuscript about her mother and is intended to make Ruth understand why Sally's life is in danger and how Ruth can help her in this difficult situation.  The ""later"" story -- and we get it intercut with the early one -- is the story of Ruth's efforts to help her mother track down a man who knows the truth about some traumatic events in the past.  Both Sally/Eva and the man she seeks have, since the war, hidden their earlier identities, but Sally's photograph had been shown in a small local newspaper at the time of her husband's funeral, and she believes that her cover has been blown.  Both narratives are tense in different ways. We obviously know that Sally/Eva will survive the war, but we don't know all the complications, twists, double-crosses, and narrow escapes that marked that earlier experience.  In the later narrative, the question is, at least partly, whether Ruth and her mother will find the man they seek in time.  We're also made uncomfortable by the fact that Ruth's young son seems an obvious target for anyone trying to get at Sally through her daughter.

The ending is a genuine surprise -- in fact, it's a kind of double-ending, one of which is fairly predictable and the other understatedly shocking.  I can say no more without giving to much away.  As far as the look of the film is concerned, attention has been paid to both periods (the 1940's and the 1970's, which is the ""present"" of the movie).  The pacing is efficient, and the suspense well directed.  I just have to say that I felt a bit odd about the end, though.",1462838400,,2888,4.555125725338491

6429575,3,B00KHSUAJG,"I wanted to like this dvd, but at the end of the day, it didn't live up to my expectations. I like Downton Abbey and Agent Carter, so I was excited to see Hayley Attwell and Michelle Dockery.  Hayley Attwell plays a WWII agent, and amazingly her performance is NOT a carbon copy of Agent Carter.  Michelle Dockery, on the other hand feels here like she's Lady Mary's only slightly hipper grandchild.

It's not a bad mini-series, but it's super dark and feels incomplete.  Essentially, there's two plots - a early WWII spy plot and then a modern plot about how the same (now older woman) suspects she's still being hunted.  The problem is that the WWII plot is based on the principle of trust no one, nothing is what it seems, but the second sort of follows the same guidelines but not really. There are several sequences where the daughter panics that her older mother has been killed, repeatedly. And it's never true.

There are several plot points that aren't well explained, especially in the more modern sequences, making me wonder if there wasn't supposed to be an extra episode or two or five. The pacing is dark, darker, and OMG, everyone is going to die.

6429600,5,B00KHSUAJG,"RESTLESS is an irresistible mystery.  What a delight to see the dignified Charlotte Rampling in a central role once again.  Rampling plays Sally Gilmartin (or does she?) a former spy working for the Allies in World War II.  Much of her story is seen in flashback where her younger incarnation is played by Haylee Atwell.  Sally is recruited as a spy by the mysterious Lucas Romer, played by the ever-brooding Rufus Sewell.  She is sympathetic (though initially resistant to the idea) because her brother is killed while in the service of the Allies.

What unfolds is a marvelously rich cloak and dagger thriller that is only resolved (or is it?) in the 1970s with the help of Sally's daughter, Ruth, played by Michelle Dockery.

There are enough twists and turns in the plot to satisfy most armchair sleuths and both periods are faithfully reproduced.  Seen side by side, the 1970s come in a dismal second to 1940s fashion sense.  For the women, hats, dresses with padded shoulders, high heels and ruby red lipstick trump sandals, bell-bottoms and halter tops any day, while for the men, pin-striped suits and fedoras rule!

A few of the plot twists might strain credibility and why oh why do we need the contemporary sounding profanities in a period piece?  Just a matter of preference, I know, but worth pointing out if one is sensitive to such things.

All in all though, RESTLESS is a satisfying thriller with enough nail-biting bits to leave you booking an appointment with your manicurist!  And yes, the title will make perfect sense in the final moments of this two-part adventure.",1450915200,,1588,4.837037037037037

6429617,2,B00KHSUAJG,"I have no idea where all the rave reviews on Amazon came from, but potential viewers have to be warned that this two-part series is truly dreadful.  The writing is terrible, the directing is mediocre, and the film is far too long (chase scenes are filler).  Only the fine acting saves Restless from complete disaster.  Indeed, film studies classes could show this as an example of how not to do a detective story, and how not to film two beautiful actresses--constantly, and from their bottoms up.  Now that Foyle, Lewis, Frost, and Vera--and perhaps even George Gently--have ended, we can no doubt look forward to little more than this sort of inept imitation of a great art form.

6429618,4,B00KHSUAJG,"Ruth Gilmartin and her young son, Jochan, visit Ruth's mom, Sally, in her English country home. It's the 1970's. You can tell as you watch the show, because there's blue eyeshadow, high-waisted jeans, Bader-Meinhof and, above all, an avocado green phone.

Something is wrong this visit. Sally asks Ruth, ""Did anybody follow you?""
Ruth: ""No. What are you talking about?""
Later, Sally pulls out binoculars and gazes out the window to the trees beyond the fence: ""There are people in the woods.... People who are watching me.""
Ruth, dismayed: ""You need to see a doctor."" Sally gives her a grim face, so Ruth backtracks: ""All right. All right. I'm sorry  but you must admit I have good cause.""
Sally: ""I'll give you good cause.""

Sally brings out a file for Ruth to read. It is an extraordinary tale that starts in Paris, summer of 1939. Back then, Sally was Eva Delectorskaya, recruited by the British secret service. This is all news to Ruth. The reason Sally is finally telling her daughter now, after 30 years, is that danger has come back from the dead. Sally is afraid for her life.

I thought ""Restless"" was enjoyable viewing. It moves between 1939 and 1970, the young Eva and the mature Sally. The show has a thinking pace. Eva has to be smart and decisive as well as brave. It isn't boring, but it isn't thriller speed. Have you seen Alec Guinness in the incredible 1979 mini-series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B005DXCO94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</a>&nbsp;?
""Restless"" has the same feel as that classic, though not as good.

""Restless"" is a British TV series that originally aired in 2 parts in December 2012. The 2 parts total about 185 minutes. The BluRay/DVD presents them in 16:9 widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital. English SDH subtitles are available.

The BluRay/DVD has one Bonus Extra, a ""Behind-the-Scenes Photo Gallery.""  It's a slide show that lasts 3 minutes.

That's the key to treachery.

6429619,5,B00KHSUAJG,"As seen on the BBC in the United Kingdom, and on the Sundance channel in 2012 in the United States, this television treatment is based on the bestselling spy novel by William Boyd, who adapted it himself.  The Emmy-nominated historical spy drama is a tale of passion, duplicity, and betrayal that shifts back and forth in time from pre-World War II to the 1970s, boasts a star-studded British cast. Young mom Ruth Gilmartin (Michelle Dockery, DOWNTON ABBEY) is taken aback to learn that her mother, Sally (Charlotte Rampling, BROADCHURCH), who seemingly cant escape the secrets of her past, has been living a double life. Her mothers real name is Eva Delectorskaya (the younger woman played by rising star Hayley Atwell, CAPTAIN AMERICA, THE FIRST AVENGER). As the younger woman, Eva had been recruited by the suave, handsome and persuasive Lucas Romer (Rufus Sewell, THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH); worked for the British Secret Service, trained in espionage for crucial missions.  But one big job ended in deadly betrayal: Eva is forced into hiding. Now, three decades later, her cover blown; she is being stalked by someone.  She recruits her unsuspecting daughter to help her track and face her former spymaster / lover, now Lord Romer (Michael Gambon, HARRY POTTER).

Rampling, trailing a long career of powerful performances behind her, is utterly believable, ""armed and dangerous and bewitching, according to Salon, and carries the gripping thriller manfully.  And Im willing to bet that there are now some movies/television treatments being made simply because Rampling is available, and so good; am mindful that many another movie has been made, is being made for other actors of outstanding ability.  Atwell holds her own, playing with what most likely was a terrifying-to-her constellation of British stars.  Sewell is fine, and as ever, easy on the eyes. Dockery doesnt get to do much in a lightweight part, looks uncomfortable in unflattering 1970s styles, blue eye shadow. Gambon gives us his usual superb nuanced performance. Unusually enough, this costume drama required interiors, transportation, clothing, hairstyles of two different decades, the 1940s and the 1970s; the set/costume designers have done well. Dont know how they did it, but I was particularly impressed with the productions 1940s American South West scenes of Arizona and New Mexico; they look not long removed from the Wild West, and we get a two lane Route 66.

This excellent thriller is tightly written and directed; the acting is remarkably good.  It gives us strong action scenes, keeps up the suspense to the very end, when it delivers a sharp surprise, in what, to me, felt like a fresh plot development for those endlessly produced, endlessly fascinating spy dramas. The box set contains a single DVD with two feature-length episodes totally approximately 185 minutes.  Also, thank goodness, subtitles, for the subtly-delivered dialog. I received it as a review copy. Above all, the productions female cast is particularly outstanding.  It is definitely not a chick flick. And I, who always prefer  surprisefemale headed works, was thrilled to finally discover a spy thriller that, for once, cast women as something other than unusually beautiful secretaries/typists/nurses/librarians or telegraph operators.",1446249600,4,3297,5.282982791586998
6429620,5,B00KHSUAJG,"I LOVE a good historical war suspense. RUTHLESS delivers with believable storyline, outstanding sets, and super-star acting. All good, all the way through.
Hayley Atwell as a young spy with handler Romer (Rufus Sewell Middlemarch) lead the cast in the WW2 years of this story. Much takes place as backstory so the largest percentage is 1940s drama and this duo shines in their performance individually and as a duo onscreen. The same pair of characters but in the year 1978 is performed by mega stars Charlotte Rampling (Broadchurch) and Michael Gambon (Emma Cranford Wives & Daughters). Again this duo delivers in magnificent performances. Bridging the gap is the spy Eva/Sallys daughter Ruth who is played by Michelle Dockery and making the role as believable as what she has done for 6 seasons as Mary in Downton Abbey. I also was impressed with two lesser roles, another spy played by Adrian Scarborough (Upstairs Downstairs Cranford) and the spy training director by Anthony Calf (New Tricks)

SDH SUBTITLES for both halves of this 3+ hour Brit spy story that must be watch from beginning to end in one sitting.
Part 1 opens in 1978 with Ruth visiting her mom, Sally, who is a good bit paranoid believing she is being watched and destined to be harmed if not killed. Shes prepared with spy glass and shotgun and a full written confession of her past which she hands to Ruth. She wants Ruths help in locating a man named Romer, the only possible help to save her life. Ruth is skeptical until she begins to read the manuscript and learns of her mothers many past secrets and duel life. The film jumps from 1978 to the 1940s telling and showing the story that Ruth reads. Part one is primarily the development of Eva and Romers relationship both professionally and romantically; plus the prep to get Eva ready for a mission to Washington DC. And there is the plan to find Romer after over 30 years.

Part 2 places Eva on her USA mission and not all goes well. Killers close in on Evasending her into hidinga threat that links the WW2 and 1978 story eras. It travels through Albuquerque, Ottawa, finding Evas eventual husband and father of Ruth, and back to London with more intense intrigue once there. By the end of the three hours of intense viewing, and multiple escapes from peril, the story is wrapped up with one down side. So much emotion is spent watching, viewers will not want the end to come. The sign of a good story is wanting more. It feels so real. It is fictional drama. I think. Or is it? I just know Ill dream about this story.",1445731200,3,2548,4.622516556291391
6429621,5,B00KHSUAJG,"41/2 stars for this one, I loved it! Saw it on Acorn TV. First rate cast, excellent suspense, wonderful clothes, cars and ambience of the times (both 1940's and 1978.)  It takes us behind the scenes of British intelligence before the US entered WWII, introducing the audience to a whole arena of espionage  I've never seen portrayed before.  1/2 star off is only because of a couple of rather confusing spots, no doubt an inevitable result of not being able to contain everything in the book.  Seriously, this is the best thing I've seen in quite awhile, better by far than the majority of movies coming out of Hollywood. And I am awed by the incredible skills it took to do what these spies did, and the toll it took on their lives.  The ending is poignant, too.
