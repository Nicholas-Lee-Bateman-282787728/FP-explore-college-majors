4883641,3,B005SGSNQY,"senseless killing,a lot of gore,awful acting.i have seen worse.not much story,the victims were talking with gags in their mouths,kinda funny and nerve wracking.",1371686400,,160,6.0
4883642,1,B005SGSNQY,"Unnecessary sex scene to begin the movie.
Then some references to other murders.  Police office had a telephone that was always ringing in the background.
Why don't they have call waiting?? Or, at least a secretary to shut the phone up.
The husband gets drugged; the wife gets knocked out. Why?
Bloody torture begins and continues, and continues, and continues.
Screaming! that was not sincere. Just go to a nursing home to hear real screams of people in pain... and they are on meds.
I fast-forwarded to see why the killer was doing it all. Not really explained.
Oh well, at least there was a minimum of foul language. The blood was phony and the wounds were obviously artificial.
Not worth the effort.",1369872000,7,703,4.715447154471545
4883643,2,B005SGSNQY,"Terrible acting. Boring through as much as i watched, which was 3/4s of it. Decided to stop waiting for it to improve. If you like torture scenes , go for it. Otherwise don't bother. It is just basically one long torture scene.",1361491200,,227,4.428571428571429
4883644,5,B005SGSNQY,This was a really terrific film. Better than the average slasher. Done on a low budget but with such good production quality it showed the crew knew how to make a good film. Great cast as well!,1358640000,,193,4.243243243243243
4883645,4,B005SGSNQY,Not bad for low budget indie slasher flick. Production value was pretty high considering the budget. Read some okay reviews about this film on various horror websites.,1350000000,,167,5.222222222222222
4883646,4,B005SGSNQY,When I got this movie I thought it has to be bad but i was surprised.  I had heard that it was made for less then 1000.  but wow what a well done film for the price.  The Cole Brothers are so resourceful in this film.  There are some very scary shots.  and the lead actor (Stephen Twardokus) is very interesting to watch.  for the budget this movie is good.  It's worth to rent or even buy for 8 dollars.,1329955200,2,404,3.975
4883657,1,B005SGSNQY,UGH !!!!!!!!,1462492800,,12,5.5
4883658,1,B005SGSNQY,Again another movie I should have been paid to watch,1462492800,,52,4.3
4883659,1,B005SGSNQY,So many low budget movies on amazon,1462147200,,35,4.142857142857143
4883660,5,B005SGSNQY,Sick flick!,1461715200,,11,5.0
4883661,3,B005SGSNQY,"Really solid effort from the Cole brothers. It looks like this was one of their first features and runs a quick paced 82 minutes. Lots of on camera gore that adds to the story and isn't over the top. The victims heal as quick as the maniac killer does with the clich 9 lives but that's just a minor complaint. Decent acting and script and exceptional execution in the Mutilation Man makes me interested in their next film.

There was a movie already a called Mutilation Man that is pretty trippy too so why call it the same title? You added ""The"" but still been used. How about Homevasion or Face Wrecker. How about Friday the 13th...In the Suburbs. Anything other than a title that has already been used. Unfortunately the ending is blown because the entire movie is a set up for a sequel. If they can scrape together another $5,000 maybe we will get to see it. I know I would watch it for sure.",1430352000,,896,4.365269461077844
4883662,5,B005SGSNQY,excellent,1427760000,,9,9.0
4883663,5,B005SGSNQY,Great indie film... Must see. Stephen Twardokus and Sabrina Carmichael were great. Derek Cole is the best indie director I've seen in a long time. Very creative.,1392854400,,161,5.0
4883664,1,B005SGSNQY,"...So, did the production run out of money?  The movie was not over but yet it still ended.  Many good horror movies leave a bit to the imagination.  The exception is ""The Mutilation Man"". It left nothing to the imagination but rather left the viewer to write a conclusion or produce a Part II.  Oh, please...no Part II.  The ""gore"" was absolutely in the ""Horror"" genre, but other than that, I am waiting for a conclusion.  But, why?  I wasted an hour watching trite violence and am glad the ""end' of the movie arrived.  gave it one star (because I could not find the option for half a star.",1388275200,,591,4.3577981651376145
4883665,1,B005SGSNQY,"Not much else to say.  It was well shot for a low budget movie though.  Although dead low budget hacks out there in movieland, if you're going to include a sex scene for NO REASON in your movie, at least have nudity.  See, that gives your pointless sex scene a point.  Otherwise it's REALLY pointless.",1388188800,,301,4.418181818181818
4883666,2,B005SGSNQY,What little plot they had was not good. Didn't make any sense and they never explained how a dead man could be doing this.,1372636800,,122,4.125

8484893,2,B005SGSNQY,"This was like Jason (Halloween) , same mask only painted Black with red highlights, the murders were too gruesome and I  lost interest in the pace & tone of this film1 2EdArt9~~~",1466208000,,178,4.5625
8484894,1,B005SGSNQY,Stupid storyline,1465257600,,16,7.5
8484895,1,B005SGSNQY,This was a terrible movie!  The ending SUCKED!!!,1464912000,,48,5.0
8484896,1,B005SGSNQY,Zero stars if I could.,1464825600,,22,3.6
8484897,4,B005SGSNQY,I'll admit a few parts of this movie kinda are pointless and although I wasn't happy with those like 3 parts/scenes the rest of the movie kept me intrigued & entertained. There wasn't much predictably here which is awesome. There's actually a good story/plot which comes to light more towards the end. My favorite part was how creative/resourceful the killer was. He thinks 'outside of the box' quite a few times. Truthfully I can see a really good sequel to this movie. I hope it'll happen! I'll be purchasing this movie to watch whenever I want!,1463961600,,547,4.708333333333333
8484898,1,B005SGSNQY,Continuation errors through out. I got confused when the head detective told another detective to meet him on the third floor of the parking garage. Unless I am wrong the building seemed to have only one floor. Maybe I saw wrong. I thought they were going to make something of one of the detectives having a bald head like the masked man but that went nowhere.,1463616000,,360,4.46969696969697
8484899,1,B005SGSNQY,The godawful acting pretty much ruined any chance of suspense it might otherwise have had. Not recommended at all.,1463270400,,114,5.052631578947368
8484900,1,B005SGSNQY,Filmed like a 80s style porno. Overall got a few minutes in and hated it.,1462579200,,73,3.933333333333333
8484901,4,B005SGSNQY,"I really enjoyed this film, the suspense kept me at the edge of my seat. Actors were great & believable. I love that the killer didn't talk & was very mysterious. Good job on this film. I will be looking for more  films by you.",1462492800,2,227,4.044444444444444
