862573,5,6304406169,"Picked this film up after watching a old vhs movie called ""Kung-Fu Mania"", which is itself a feature film of nothing but old kung-fu movie trailers. Pretty entertaining, but after a while I wanted to see some of the movies it highlighted, and I chose this one. Simply spectacular. The movie picture is great (way better than vhs!) and the sound is exceptable. The incredible thing about this movie though, is the way Ogami tears through his opponents. To actually see someone who is obvoiously MASTERED in the art of iaito, (drawing, striking, killing, and resheathing the blade in one fluid movement) is absolutely a wonder to behold. I mean this guy is FAST..... in the opening scene he does some kind of sword twirl over his head and resheathes so fast it's stupid. Incredible skill with a blade demonstrated by the main character Ogami,in fact I've never seen any film with actual iaito and sword skills like this demonstrated. You will not see action like this in Kill Bill (even though those movies are great too). Story is not bad, price not bad( you will not find this movie at blockbuster), overall happy with purchase. Any and all who have an interest in fuedal Japan, Japanese swords, watching cool old-school style samurai movies, or just want to see how iaito works should definitely pick this up. I'm not kidding, buy it now! Note- Do not attempt to imitate Ogami after watching this film; I have no doubt that the man has trained FOR YEARS at doing what he does, and he is SCARY fast!",1265932800,2,1499,4.660377358490566
862574,1,6304406169,"5 stars for the show
-4 stars for the package/ publisher
Total 1 star.
I live in Japan and love this classic old tv show. Here it is held in much higher esteem than the movie of the same name (long available in the US). I was very happy when I found out about the recently released US edition, as my Old Japanese comprehension is not that great.  I ordered Vols 1-3.

However when my order arrived several (half?) of the discs were loose in their box and horribly scratched, unreadable by my player. I have ordered plenty of dvds off amazon to Japan w/no previous problems so it is probably a Tokyo Shock problem.  The episodes I was able to see were excellent as expected, and it was great being able to understand the complex plots better w/subtitles.  I really want to order the rest of the series, however will not do so until I firgure out how to get a refund/ exchange my scratched copies for good ones and get assurance that the boxes have been improved.

The stories are great, the actor is apparently a classically trained Kabuki actor famous in Japan, and he brings a great prasence to the part (unlike the movie actor, apparently).  I highly recommend this TV show. 5 stars for all episodes. However Tokyo Shock and the dvd boxes they used rate -4 stars for a total of 1 star.

PS the price is less than 1/4 of the Japanese domestic dvd of the tv series (someone was complaining about the price).",1231286400,,1407,4.388461538461539
862575,5,6304406169,"This is an excellent TV series, not as bloody as the films but it is more faithful to the original Manga books.
My biggest criticism is that Media Blasters are only putting two episodes per disc. Apart from the cost, that's an AWFUL lot of DVD's taking up shelf space.
The good news is that there will be a box set, the bad news is it could be some time coming.

862638,5,6304406169,Classic feudal japan and samurai flick blended with modern weapons of the time.  Well made.,1178409600,3,91,5.066666666666666
862639,5,6304406169,"Ogami Itto is an expert swordsman, a ronin, an outcast mercenary who once served as the official executioner of the shogunate.  Then something happened - I believe his wife was murdered, although the movie doesn't give details - and Itto, the Lone Wolf, now travels the countryside with son Daigoro, the Cub, in a niftily tricked out baby cart, selling his services to the highest bidder.

 LONE WOLF AND CUB: BABY CART TO HADES is the second Lone Wolf & Cub movies I've seen and I've enjoyed both of them tremendously.  Even the confusing stuff doesn't really get in the way of appreciating this great action movie.  Not only aren't we told why Ogami (Tomisaburo Wakayama) is an outcast, the film also throws a lot of feudal Japanese history at you, not a whole lot of which sticks.  Japan, as I gather from the story, is a political hodge-podge, with a distant shogun and a number of local feudal lords, one of whom Lone Wolf is engaged to assassinate - for his standard fee of 500 pieces of gold.  There are other bad guys who carry repeating pistols, so I guess this takes places sometime during the mid-19th century.  Ogami is a samurai, though, and the Code as developed through him in this movie disdains guns.  The True Warrior doesn't use them.  My favorite mystery, though, concerns the different techniques used by samurai.  Ogami uses the Suiouryu Style, or the Horse-Slaying Technique.  The identification of it is used by his enemies to tell when he was the one who made one of the numerous corpses that populate this film.

  The plot is functionally unexceptional.  Ogami travels with Daigoro.  While at an inn Ogami defends a young woman who murdered a man who was going to sell her into prostitution.  To save her, Ogami undergoes a ritual torture in her stead.  His torturers want a local governor murdered.  This blade for hire.  The governor has resources of his own to call to his defense - sleek and silent ninjas, samurai, gunners, archers, and hordes of sword wielding foot soldiers.  Can our baby-toting hero match an army sent to stop him?

 LONE WOLF AND CUB: BABY CART TO HADES is pretty nonstop, exotic and engaging, with a charismatic star and son.  In many ways it's similar to the proficient gunslinger coming into and cleaning up Dodge City, with the advantage of the expanded cinematic possibilities offered by sword fights.  I can't wait to watch the rest of this series.  Highest recommendation.",1150588800,5,2432,4.742243436754177
862640,5,6304406169,"In many ways, this is my favorite of the Lone Wolf & Cub movies. It was the first I ever saw, wherein I was trying to figure out the whole premise as it went along.

This one starts on a river trip, scenic, but I had no idea where it was going. I could not BELIEVE it when the hero cut down the first 3 assassins in the first 5 minutes... in an otherwise quiet forest, where he and his son were taking a ""bathroom break"". I replayed the scene twice, including slow-mo on the flourish with which he clears the blood from his sword and sheaths it.

I LOVE these movies and have watched them again and again. The photography is bright and lush when our heroes are traveling in the country. The spoken Japanese is abrupt and guttural (men) and pitched and inflected (women), and subtitles are placed well for non-distracting readability. I find myself grunting monosyllables (ooshh! yyoot!) in empathy. The costumes and side characters are bright, colorful, and medieval-Japanese folkloric (i.e., like watching ""authentic"" costume in a Shakespeare play).

It's an exotic, lush, exaggerated world of Japanese and Samurai absolutes that never really existed was but whose principles still appeal to some part of us. Lone Wolf & Cub are unique among Samurai movies for their exaggeration AND their not taking themselves TOO seriously.

I particularly like two things in this movie. The first is the touching interactions between father and son in simple settings like eating or washing. The second is the woman leader of the entertainment band which recruits the hero's help. She has got the best accent and attitude I have ever seen in a Japanese woman character! For that matter, NONE of the women leads in Lone Wolf & Cub movies are exactly shy, retiring types.

Be warned all the Lone Wolf & Cub movies have graphic gore (spraying blood, death throes, severed heads) and sex (rape scenes, bare bosoms).

I agree that internal and night scenes are darkly lit, but I found only a few hard to follow.",1120521600,11,1994,4.731988472622478
862641,2,6304406169,Though I like the stories in this series I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD.  The picture was dark and hard to view.,1107734400,,126,4.04
862642,5,6304406169,"I have to wonder what it is like for those who have not read the manga epic ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima  when they watch these movie adaptations from the 1970s.  Those of us who read all 142 episodes have the advantage of recognizing the various stories along the Assassin's Road that Koike works into each script.  Consequently we are perfectly content to enjoy the episodic nature of these films, whereas the uninitiated might be bothered by the lack of a plot, especially if they have seen the first two films in the series and are expecting the Yagyu to be more of a presence.

""Kozure kami: Shinikazeni mukau ubaguruma"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades"") is the third of the six films starring Tomisaburo Wakayama as the assassin for hire and Akihiro Tomikawa as his cub.  Father and son continue along the Assassin's Road and there are three episodes from the manga that constitute major sections of the film, along with brief moments culled from other stories (e.g., the river crossing from #53 ""Drifting Shadows"" and using Daigoro drowning in a river to set up a kill from #2 ""A Father Knows His Child's Heart as Only a Child Can Know His Father's"").  In fact, when you spot something that does not seem familiar from the manga, it will send you scurrying to your Dark Horse Comics collection to see if you have simply forgotten it.

The first major section is from ""Wandering Samurai"" (#46), where a mother and daughter are brutally raped by a group of ""Watari-kashi,"" who murder their escort.  When Magomura Kanbei (Go Kato) shows up and see what has happened he kills the women and then makes the assailants draw lots so that he can kill one of them, who will then be blamed for the atrocity.  However, Ogami Itto has seen what has happened and the best moment in this film comes AFTER the inevitable duel between our hero and Kanbei, which involves a philosophical discussion on the true way of the warrior.

We move directly to the second major section, which adapted ""The Virgin and the Whore"" (#18).  A young peasant woman who has been sold into prostitution kills her pimp when he tries to take advantage of her.  Lone Wolf and Cub are staying at the same inn and when she tries to hide in their room, she comes under Ogami Itto's protection.  The ""Boohachimono"" that run the brothel want to punish her, but our hero refuses to allow it and agrees to take her place instead when their leader, Torizo (Yuko Hamada), demands satisfaction.  He is then subjected to the punishment of being repeatedly dunked upside down in a tub of water and then being beaten black and blue by bamboo sticks.  As a result the young girl is given her freedom.

This becomes a set up for the big fight at the end, as Torizo sets up Ogami Itto with an Elder who wants to hire the assassin Lone Wolf.  Unfortunately our hero has a prior commitment, which requires the assembling of dozens of samurai and other warriors to try and take down Lone Wolf and Cub.  The set up is slightly different, but the battle is essentially what we have in ""The Yagyu Letter"" (#50).  This has to be the climax for the film because you can count the number of people still alive in the film on the fingers of one hand.

By this point Wakayama has the part down well past the point of cold.  His face makes Buster Keaton look like Jim Carey.  Add to this how the choreography for the sword fights is well above average for this genre and you can see its appeal to fans.  True to the manga, there are several instances of nudity and blood spurting (but much more of the latter).  What is missing is the sense of Ogami Itto's mission, which was set up in the first film in the series.  This time around Lone Wolf is killing a lot more people to stay alive and to right wrongs than he is to make another 500 ryo.  But then we had no clue at that point what those accumulated fees were for.  Keep in mind that these first four movies were made in 1972, which was only two years after the first story of ""Kozure kami"" was published.

I know these movies were edited and dubbed into ""Shogun Assassin"" in 1980, but just take the high road and avoid that butchery in favor of the original sextet of films: (1) ""Kozure kami: Kowokashi udekashi tsukamatsuru"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance,"" 1972); (2) ""Kozure kami: Sanzu no kawa no ubaguruma"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart at the River Styx,"" 1972); (3) ""Kozure kami: Shinikazeni mukau ubaguruma"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades,"" 1972); (4) ""Kozure kami: Oya no kokoro ko no kokoro"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: In Peril,"" 1972); (5) ""Kozure kami: Meifumando"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart in Land of Demons,"" 1973); and (6) ""Kozure kami: Jigoku e ikuzo! Daigoro"" (""Lone Wolf and Cub: White Heaven in Hell,"" 1974).  The above does not include literal translations of each Japanese title but rather the name given their most recent U.S. releases (I believe the original U.S. releases in the 1970s just numbered these as ""Swords of Vengeance"" I-VI).  The literal translation of this third film in the series would be ""Lone Wolf and Cub: Perambulator Against the Winds of Death,"" so you can see why that would not be the way to go.",1099958400,37,5187,4.510683760683761
862643,4,6304406169,"Although I heard 1 & 2 were the cream of the crop (cooked down further into ""Shogun Assassin"") -- it really pays to see all of the director Misumi Kenji's work on this series.  #3 is quite good as it spirals out ever wider and wider telling the story of a series of job Ogami must perform to repay a debt.  The way the director handles action and gore is simply stunning -- poetic but fun.  Sadly, Misumi does not work on the next, 4th installment.
One story (the farmer girl) is adapted from Vol. 3 of the manga, story ""The Virgin and the Whore"".  As with the comic, the movie provides information and insight into the Tokugawa Period and its customs.  Those who enjoy this movie series should pick up Dark Horse Comic's manga series (28 volumes, each at $9.95, 300 pages each) -- the manga is beautiful and exciting reading.",1089417600,5,826,4.407894736842105
862644,5,6304406169,"This 3rd entry in the Series is one of the best.  There are several plots involved, more or less revolving around the Bushido code and what are the correct actions and responsibilities of the true Warrior, the true Samurai.
Ogami states that he and his young son, Daigoro, ""live the life of Demons, without rules"" but in truth, Ogami Itto is a true warrior and, although an implacable and remorseless assassin, he strictly follows the Warrior's code of behavior.
This is demonstrated in this film when he, at the outset, declines to duel with another honorable, though disgraced, Samurai; and later, when Itto saves a farm girl from servitude as a prostitute and indures the Water & Buri Buri torture (don't ask) in her place.
Very stylized and as bloody and violent as the rest, I found the six-gun packing villain a bit incongruous (six guns in the  17th Century?), and the series steps far into the fantastic with Itto literally slaying an army of opponents with a trickier than we supposed Baby Cart and a two-sword frenzy of slashing and stabbing, chopping and skewering dozens of enemies (with the by now familiar gushes and sprays of blood).
But, what the hell, James Bond can kill em by the dozen,  so why not our Master of the Suiouryu Horse-Slaying Technique, Ogami Itto?  And in the end, there is an elegant duel with the disgraced Samurai and we learn the true Way of the Warrior is to ""live to die"".  Great liner notes, and good subtitles help to explain what you need to know as background to the story.",1019433600,14,1517,4.645522388059701
862645,5,6304406169,"This entry into the Lone Wolf and Cub series, was quite simply, excellent. From baby Daigoro, who is truly a son that any father could not help but be proud of for his uncommon coolness and spiritual strength, to the Samurai of great personal skill who was unjustly banished from his clan. After showing superior skill and loyalty, he's cast out of his respectful samurai position and ultimately gets caught up against Ogami Itto after being forced to work a less than dignified job to survive. Through his trials, he still seeks to know the true Way of the Samurai, since he's confused as to what that means. As fate would have it, the actions he thought epitomized a Warrior were the very actions that got him banished in the first place. I thought that this conflict and his ""High-Noon"" Showdown with Ogami near the end where Ogami finally answers his questions about what being a SAmurai is all about and Daigoro's continued coming of age made this film most memorable, along with the skills displayed by Ogami Itto. The man doesn't miss any tricks. If a great action/Martial Arts flick with lessons in honor are for you, You won't want to miss this one.",1012521600,6,1158,4.6536585365853655

7870091,4,6304406169,"A wandering ronin and his young son continue their journey through feudal Japan, taking contracts when afforded the opportunity and facing assassination with each step. This chapter seems dedicated to clarifying our disgraced samurai's complicated code of honor. Though he'll gladly slice through an almost unlimited number of strangers in battle, Itt's vision isn't clouded by a perennial bloodlust. We see restraint in several dangerous situations, respect for principled opponents, loyalty to his word and, in the film's most memorable scene, a willingness to take vicious punishment in lieu of the innocently accused. The story feels more episodic than ever, with various scenes playing out like a classic movie serial and an unresolved conflict lingering at the credits. Given the rate at which they were churning these things out in the early '70s, maybe there's something to that. The action is reliably good, still fresh and creative after three feature-lengths, though the gigantic slaughter instigated at the climax (ambushed, Itt single-handedly takes out fifty men and a trio of mounted officers) does stretch things a bit. Wise, then, that the film went back to basics almost immediately after, closing the action with an eerily quiet, respectful duel amidst the dust of that epic battlefield.",1490054400,,1306,5.4068627450980395

Movie Review: This is the 3rd in a series 6 of Lone Wolf And Cub. The reason why I love this one is because the final moments of the movie when Lone Wolf And Cub battle a s*** load of people with his machine gun cart, blowing people into pieces with his grenades, chopping up a lot of people, and the seppuku scene. Though it's not as great as the first two films, it's still a wonderful movie for it's action, Lone Wolf And Cub character and the story was neat.
