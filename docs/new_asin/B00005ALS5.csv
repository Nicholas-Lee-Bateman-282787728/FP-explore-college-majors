1413769,5,B00005ALS5,"...being that it is ABOUT LIFE IN CUBA and the CUBAN STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM from a tiranical government.. who on EARTH forgot to add a spanish language track, and at the very least- a spanish subtitle feature- to the DVD?!?! Subtitled VHS? Boo..Hiss on HBO. Come now, do they honestly think there are no cuban-americans who might wish to view this great film in their native language? For example, our 70'yr old grandmother who experienced first hand, what viewers of this film only begin to understand. She is unable to enjoy this film about her home, because the spanish language track and subtitles were left off? Sad..
Otherwise, this movie is fantastic. Although, I am told on solid authority that Sandoval had life (while in Cuba) a whole lot better than a majority of Cuban's.. however, his struggle and fame helped to bring press and attention to the serious issues facing the Cuban People.",1018828800,8,896,4.824675324675325
1413770,5,B00005ALS5,"I must admit I bought this movie ONLY because Andy Garcia played a role. I didn't expect anything of the film, it sure didn't sound very interesting. But how wrong I was! Through the film I learned to like the music of the trumpet. Arturo Sandoval is giving the trumpet a life of its own, with fantastic expressions of feelings. I have after seeing the film listned to more trumpets and it is fantastic! It isn't all films I have gotten so much out of.",1017878400,4,452,4.329411764705882
1413771,5,B00005ALS5,"For everyone who is interested in jazz in general and in Arthuro Sandoval in particular, this DVD is a must. In addition, it gives a depressive picture of life in communist Cuba. When Sandoval has to suppress his musicality (i.e. his desire to express himself through jazz) life in Cuba becames intolerable. Andy Garcia is great as Mr. Sandoval and Ma Maestro as his life-time love, Marianela, is just gorgeous. I would have wanted more soundtracks with Sandoval, but I can always listen to his great recodings (especially the beautiful ""I remember Clifford""). Go get it!",1007856000,7,571,4.958333333333333
1413772,5,B00005ALS5,Very well done HBO movie about the great Cuban-American jazz trumpeteer. Very emotional and touching performance from Andy. Also a great performance from the unbelievably gorgeous Mia Maestro. Great screenplay that really focused on the characters and the impact the situations had on the family. A DVD worth owning even though its made for cable.,1003536000,2,347,5.327272727272727
1413773,5,B00005ALS5,"You wanna play the horn, right?  You gotta play the game!  -For Love or Country
If a character in the movie The Player were pitching For Love or Country, he would describe it thus :  it's the Sound of Music, but set in Cuba.  Indeed, this gross oversimplification manages to capture some  important aspects of the film.  Arturo Sandoval, like the von Trapps, is a real life musician--a  renowned jazz trumpeter--who fled a repressive regime and whose flight was complicated by concerns  for family.  But the differences are also important, and they serve to give this picture a depth and  resonance that make it wholly worthwhile in its own right.
First, where the Nazis are so notorious as to immediately invoke our sympathy for the von Trapps,  there has been a disturbing tendency in America to glamorize Fidel Castro and to minimize the crimes  of his regime, right from the very beginning of the Revolution and the absurdly favorable profiles that  the New York Times published in the late 50s.  In a grotesque irony, this film was actually made  during the whole Elian Gonzalez mess, when a significant portion of the American public, and a  majority of the intellectual class, argued that a young boy, whose mother died trying to get him to  freedom, should be returned to live in Castro's dictatorship.  One of the fascinations of For Love or  Country is that it gives us a rare glimpse into the lives of regular Cuban citizens and shows the spirit  crushing effects of Communism on their lives.  And it powerfully demonstrates the illegitimacy of a  political system which is so bent on controlling the minds of its citizenry that even certain rebellious  forms of music are outlawed.  In one of the best scenes, Sandoval's wife, Marianela, asks an official for  permission for her husband to play straightforward jazz, rather than just the distinctively latin jazz that  he has helped pioneer in the band Irakere.  The Party leader ominously warns her not to say something  she'll regret and admonishes her that the Revolution needs everyone's' support to survive.  In turn, she  asks :
  If the Revolution can't withstand...a Cuban man playing the music he loves, why bother trying to  save it ?
What lends this scene its particular power is that, where Arturo has always harbored doubts about the  Revolution and has refused to join the Party, Marianela has been a firm defender and has acted as a  brake on his desire to rebel and even to flee.  This dynamic, of Arturo being forced to choose between  his love for his wife and his yearning to be free to play his own music, gives the story its great drama.  In general, the scenes showing how difficult a choice it is for people to defect, to love family, friends,  and homeland behind, are genuinely affecting, and should serve as a tonic for anyone who questions  the motivations and commitment of refugees who seek our shores.
Added to the strong political themes are a hopefully career reviving performance by Andy Garcia, once  one of Hollywood's hottest young stars; a dynamic star turn by Charles S. Dutton as Dizzy Gillespie;  and, of course, a terrific soundtrack.  Unfortunately, this movie, though it won several awards, was  only shown on cable, but now that it is available on a budget priced DVD, perhaps it will find the  wider audience it so richly deserves.  I hope so, though I tend to doubt it.  But there is a consolation; at  the end of the movie you somehow feel a little bit prouder to be an American, just knowing what the  Sandovals went through to become Americans themselves.

1413774,4,B00005ALS5,"Entertaining, enlightening drama!  This artistic production (originally an HBO tele-film) presents a touching love story shown against a colorful visual backdrop set to vibrant music.  Great acting!  I was an admirer of Andy Garcia's talents prior to viewing this piece, which has only increased my appreciation of his abilities (he is also executive producer).  Mr. Garcia's love for Cuba and passion for music (jazz) are present throughout as the story, which is predictable (and told in flashbacks) unfolds.  The viewer senses the rising frustration of musician Arturo Sandoval (Garcia) at the conflict presented by his human need to freely express his love (music),which is increasingly blocked by the repressive political regime in power, without losing his lover (who becomes his wife) and son.  As political developments occur (which are depicted through newsclips viewed by characters), he sadly concludes that he must leave his native Cuba.  Mia Maestro as Mrs. Sandoval, a Cuban supporter of the Castro regime at the beginning (a government employee, in fact) similarly experiences an emotional journey which eventually leads her to realize she must follow her husband (and her heart) by agreeing to defect with him.  The complications of carrying out this effort provide the essence of the story.  Charles Dutton, as Dizzy Gillespie, plays a colorful character who has a pivotal part as the plot unfolds; Gloria Estefan also appears.  The story is more poignant because we know that it is a biography, and that Mr. and Mrs. Sandoval provided technical advice. Thank you to Mr. Garcia and to Mr. Sandoval for giving us this story!  The sharp technical quality of the DVD format enhances the colorful recreation of 1970's Havanna (the production was actually shot in Puerto Rico and Miami); the edition also includes interviews with cast members.",987984000,,1855,5.275510204081633
1413775,4,B00005ALS5,"As an made for TV movie I had not heard ""For Love Or Country - Arturo Sandovol"". It would be a shame if this movie does not get a wider viewing for it is a story that should be seen by all.
Based on a contempary, true story, it combines elements of romance, wonderful music, with the harsh reality of life under Castro, even for heros of the ""revolution"".  As one supressed & ""persecuted"" by the state, Arturo Sandoval presents an unvarnished, but honest, political message that we all can learn from.
Basically the story is about a great musician who faces the choice of submitting himself to the state God (Fidel's revolution in this case) in order to be fully develop and practice his God given ability or defecting. However as the movie reveals in an effective series of flashbacks, it is not only the exceptional person who is stifled, but a wide swath of society that never has a chance to realize its potential.
A secondary theme is the sweet, tender love story between Arturo and his wife; and the confict that arise between different political perspectives.  Gradually, Arturo's beautiful, but politically naive wife also realizes how the Castro's revolution that captivated her as a youth, has betrayed its own ideals for the benefit of its icon and image.
Even though it is a made for TV film, the move has first rate acting, script, and production. While the film location (Puerto Rico) had a Cuban feel, the production & location failed to accurately portray the true degree of poverty & deprivation that Cubans face daily. As a companion to this movie, I urge you to view ""The Bueno Vista Social Club"" for more great Cuban vibes; plus the genuine Cuban film location which reveals depreciating effect of Castro's socialism on a country's people and infrastructure.
Finally, this film is an excellent example of a great, entertaining, dramatic movie without unneccesary graphic sex or violence.  Despite its PG-13 rating for a subdued scene of premarital sex and a brief, justifiable display of anger and frustration, I would not hesitate to let family members over ten view this film. In fact I would recommend it for preteens and teenagers for its realistic portrayal of the tension and dangers of placing the state above its citizens.",987897600,3,2250,4.823834196891192

Events in Cuba prevent him from playing American lyrics. The movie depicts his very personal struggle to get past the walls that hold he, his wife, his children and his family.  He made several attempts to defect to no avail. There were heartaches and disappointments, but he persevered.  There were cultural differences between Cuba and the United States.  Arturo continues the struggle to get his family to the United States throughout the movie and the excitement  and adventure builds.  This movie is based on a True Story and it's wonderful!

It made me appreciate my freedoms as an American all the more.

Politics aside, this film is the perfect marriage of jazz, Afro-Cuban rhythms, and passion.  I cannot understand how it is possible for anyone to play the way Sandoval does!  The things he does with a trumpet are transcendent.

Watch for an excellent performance by Charles S. Dutton as Dizzy Gillespie.  Garcia and Maestro are combustible---their passion nearly ignites the screen.  If you are a jazz lover, a lover of Cuba or Cubans, or both, watch this film!",1245628800,,843,4.648648648648648

His wife is a government employee who at first believes in the revolution until her eyes are opened to the reality behind the facade.  The final straw is when Castro kills a hero of the revolution because he feels his monolithic power is threatened.

  In 1990 Sandoval defects at the US embassy in Greece, but is stopped by bureaucracy until his friend Dizzy Gillespie calls the Vice President....yes, that's right, Dan Quayle the dunce.  Well the only good thing Quayle ever does is speeding Sandoval through the bureaucracy.  The irony here is that any Cuban who can get to the US by raft is granted US citizenship, but Sandoval is thoroughly grilled.
