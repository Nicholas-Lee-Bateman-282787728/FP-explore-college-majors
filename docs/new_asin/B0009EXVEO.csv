2285390,5,B0009EXVEO,"Like a shooting star illuminating a dark night, Micael sheds light on the truth behind Jesus. He also comments on the current state of religion in the world.

2285391,5,B0009EXVEO,"""The mindset of the Hamburger Universe, (which is the mindset of religion, also known as the flat earth mentality), where the earth is in the middle, above we have the arc of the heavens in which everybody worthwhile is corralled, underneath we have the underworld where the devil is and his mignons are housed, and where everybody who has been bad goes when they die, after one single lifetime"".

Dr Miceal Ledwith has wittingly created the interesting analogy of the Hamburger Universe, to best describe the misleading deceptive illusions that religions have used to keep us buried in the depths of ignorance for so many years.

Dr Ledwith uses this analogy to illustrate how this way of thinking has severely limited the development and evolution of humanity, and that it has corrupted the whole way we think about God and human destiny. Its exciting to see someone of such learned background, who was ordained a Catholic Priest in 1967, and has been a professor of theology and college president for over 25 years, arrive at such a place where he is openly and objectively challenging religions and the deceptions they have laid upon us for thousands of years. I applaud Dr Ledwith's courage to step forth with such truths!

Dr Ledwith poignantly suggests that there is far more to this physical world than the Hamburger Universe has ever given us a glimpse of, and that with the immensity of the universe, ""How can we be so arrogant, so blind, so retarded as to believe we are the center of everything, and its only 400 years since Galileo was in danger of death for suggesting that the earth orbited the sun""!

""Its high time we took a huge step forward! Its time to leave the narrow and bigoted views behind us and change our mindset from the flat earth mentality and the Hamburger Universe"".

This presentation is loaded with big questions, similar to those that I have asked myself many times, yet never getting any kind of satisfactory answer from religion. As Dr Ledwith says, people are looking for direction and answers and meaning in human life, and you have to know where to look to find the answers. This information may very well scramble some underlying beliefs, (and for our own sake lets hope that it does) because most of us have never had the opportunity to observe them so clearly and rationally, and to sincerely question their validity as Dr Ledwith does so objectively. I found that I got much more from this DVD viewing it the second time around. There is so much to absorb and contemplate, that it is well worth watching over and over.

""Why have we drifted so far away? Its because we do not know who we are. The mindset of the flat earth is still alive and well in all of us today, even though we don't suspect it. We've jettisoned the obvious aspects of it, but the really dangerous aspects of it, the really deceptive deceiving aspects of it are still alive in the culture and the tradition, especially of the western world. And if we want to make any evolution spiritually possible, there are issues which we must address"".

Overall, I found this entire DVD to contain information and perspectives that are freeing and filled with hope, giving us direction and opportunity for clarity, change and liberation. Dr Ledwith's amusingly dry, Irish sense of humor adds wit to otherwise very serious subject matter. He gives welcomed encouragement, and a way out of the misleading deceptive illusions created by religion that have kept us buried in the depths of ignorance.

I immediately noticed that the art direction of this presentation could be greatly improved upon, (being an art director from way back) in regards to holding the visual attention of the viewer upon the subject, also interjecting interest and life into the long dissertation for a more overall professional look, which I feel this profound information is entirely worthy of. However, the DVD itself is nicely packaged with an accompanying full color brochure. This is definitely a DVD that I am proud to include in my library, where the information will continue to richly add to my own contemplations and personal evolution.

I look forward to the next DVD in the series, and to Dr Miceal Ledwith's forthcoming book ""Forbidden Truth"". Other related material to view and read must include the movie ""What The Bleep Do We Know"", and the volumes of Ramtha's teachings titled ""Ramtha"" (The White Book) and ""A Master's Reflection on the History of Humanity"" Volumes 1 and 2, for much revealing historical information relating to Dr Ledwith's information. Other volumes that also relate to this information include The Nine Faces of Christ, and The Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East.",1128038400,66,4694,4.813895781637717
2285392,5,B0009EXVEO,"So often people are so terrified to leave or even examine the basic precepts from which they live from. I've read some of the reviews and I could not help but notice how incredibly Hamburger Universe-ish their comments were. Someone mentioned that the cost was high, others complained how this simply did not fit? FIT IN TO WHAT? One of the reviewers almost wrote an essay - why so desperate? The fact remains that people have a desperate need for answers, even if they continue to give it to themselves, because no one else can possibly have a valid point of view, sort of intellectual in-breeding. A friend of mine Brock Smith once said to me ""Free your mind and your ass will follow!"" Remember, truths are ALWAYS simple, that is why they are unmistakable.",1126051200,23,758,4.622222222222222

You know this fellow even sounds like a character from a sci-fi flik, you know esteemed Jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the Sith; or even Tolkien's Saruman,  hey folks get Christopher Lee's opinion of the DVD before you fork over your hard earned bucks, and uh...do a search on this Ramtha spirit, er channeled, er thingy!!!

2285395,2,B0009EXVEO,"""The human race today is in a really bad state, mainly because most people do not want to wake up. They want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power."" -- Miceal Ledwith in The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions

I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD ""What the BLEEP Do We Know!?"" mostly for the engaging snippets of dialogue from scientists, theologians, and mystics. I also enjoyed Ramtha's DVD ""Create Your Day"", even though it wasn't quite as good as the BLEEP cameos.

It was with great expectations that I viewed The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions by Miceal Ledwith. Unfortunately, the plodding pace of the 57 minute DVD--as well as the ramblings of Ledwith--was very disappointing.

Ledwith brings up some great points in this DVD, but never goes beyond the surface. He asserts that thinking people have discarded most of the infantile tenants of the ""hamburger universe"" (i.e. the ""vault of the heavens"" overhead with the vault of hell underneath). Yet, instead of treating his audience as intelligent folk, he makes nebulous comments without explaining the ""what and why"".

He mentions string theory (quantum physics) and the ""true"" nature of the big bang, going on to say that levitation isn't a ""miracle"" but only a matter of superseding gravity with the ""Torsion Field"". The problem is that he's tossing about these terms in support of Jesus' words that ""ye are all gods"" and ""greater works than these shall you do"" without actually explaining the meaning or *science* of a Torsion Field and just how consciousness supersedes natural laws. (FYI: The Torsion Field is quantum spin waves of empty space. Einstein and Elie Cartan did some preliminary work on this theory in the 1920's. The Einstein-Cartan theory could possibly be used to explain ESP, among other things.)

Ledwith spends a good portion of the DVD highlighting the silliness of traditional Christianity, including the clouds and harps of heaven. He goes on and on about how a cloud is, in reality, damp and would be uncomfortable to sit on (duh) and that if one were to play the harp for eternity, they'd wear down the fingers to the third knuckle. I understand highlighting the damage that traditional Christian thought has caused humanity, especially in terms of evolution. In fact, as a former minister trained in theology myself, I probably ""get it"" more than most.

But while poking fun at Christian thought is popular these days, you had *better* have some theological and scientific claims to back up your assertions--especially if you want to be a part of the ""thinking"". Christian apologists know their Bible inside and out, so if Ledwith wants to undermine their fear-based, illogical ideas he needs to do so with his supposed area of expertise...THEOLOGY. Heck, even at a simplified level, all one has to do is consider that if an individual set a paddle on fire and repeatedly hit a baby with it over and over and over, this act would be considered a barbaric tragedy condemned by Christians (and others, of course).

Yet, God the Father would do much worse by condemning humanity to eternal torment forever and ever? Apologists would say ""Well, humans CHOOSE to go to hell."" The interesting thing is that the Bible says ""no man can come to the Father except the Holy Spirit draws him"" because his understanding is ""darkened"".

This is just one of the many points that Ledwith could bring up, but instead, he preaches to the New Age choir by ridiculing monotheistic religions (primarily Christianity) via nebulous assertions. In fairness, Ledwith makes excellent points, but nothing that you couldn't get (much more eloquently) from Marianne Williamson, Gary Zukav, Eckhart Tolle, Neale Donald Walsch, and others. Some of these points are:

""We are pawns tossed about by those people we perceive as more capable and enlightened than us.""

""If Jesus were on Earth today, he wouldn't recognize his own teachings.""

""Anyone who looks back at our history can only be appalled at the small-mindedness, the hostility, the barbarism that has characterized our whole traverse as a race.""

""We don't realize how following another's image of God is spiritually and evolutionarily limiting. We don't even think of it.""

""The flat earth mentality still corrupts and completely distorts our fundamental beliefs at the basic level still today.""

""We've never gotten rid of the Inquistatorial mind to this day.""

""The answers we've been given by religion are bizarre, emotionally charged, and childish.""

""Heaven varies according to the broker (Christian denomination), but the basis is pretty much the same: earning credits for good behavior so you can immigrate to heaven.""

""God is just a human magnified (in monotheism). We take these categories from the lowest plains of existence and impose them upon the Divine. As a result, we're left with something so sentimental, mawkish, and inaccurate that it bears no relationship to reality.""

""Whatever God is has no gender. These childish images are holding us back.""

Ledwith makes other interesting comments, but they beg for elaboration. One such comment is:

""(That) Jesus' death was to appease the vengeance of a savage God...this had NOTHING to do with what Jesus Christ did.""

I'd love to hear his explanation of the crucifixion! Spiritual teachers such as Williamson have brilliantly explained the metaphysical aspects of the crucifixion of Christ. Does Ledwith have a clue as to why Jesus died? If he did, why didn't he share it?

He quotes Jesus by saying ""greater works (than I) shall you do"", attempting to make the case that humans are living far below their potential--mostly due to a flat earth mentality. What he fails to mention, however, is that polemicists and theologians debate the meaning of ""greater works"" (meizona toutn in the Greek) in terms of whether ""greater"" refers to quantity versus quality. (My Greek professor made a case for the former, saying that converts would multiply miracles by sheer numbers.)

Ledwith also perpetuates the biggest misquote circulated in New Age circles, attributing ""It's not our weakness that frightens us, it's our power"" to Nelson Mandela. The actual quote is ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure..."", which was uttered by Marianne Williamson in her book ""A Return to Love"".

One of Ledwith's comments that I found particularly insightful is ""As human knowledge grows, the territory of God shrinks. God becomes a refugee."" The ""God of the gaps"", as he called it, are areas that we try to fill with human knowledge in the attempt to explain what we don't yet understand. An example would be ancient paganism attributing lightning to the actions of Zeus. Despite this interesting observation, it's not enough to enliven the rest of the DVD.

What separates the tight, insightful segements in ""What the BLEEP Do We Know!?"" from this DVD is that the conversations captured in BLEEP were the result of directors Chasse, Arntz and Vincente ASKING probing questions of the experts...questions borne out of the directors' own curiosity and personal paths. On The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions, however, Ledwith is left to ramble at the camera rather aimlessly, which doesn't make for good viewing and does not offer lucid alternatives to the flat earth mentality of the hamburger universe. Perhaps this is more the fault of ""director"" JZ Knight.

In the end, I couldn't help but feel like this DVD was thrown together in order to capitalize on BLEEP's popularity. Let's hope the subsequent installments of this series are tighter, deeper, and smarter.",1121040000,160,7724,5.043171114599686
2285396,5,B0009EXVEO,"Finally here is a scholar that provides a focused look at how our flat earth mentality trips us up and keeps us hidebound in outdated modes of thinking - with a fine humor I might add!  As a scientist, I know the earth is round, but regardless of education we still carry the baggage of our culture which Dr Ledwith so clearly exposes for us to see in all its glory.  Very thought provoking!  I'm certainly looking forward to the rest of the volumes in the series....I hear the next one is about the real life of Jesus.",1118534400,26,519,4.275510204081633

But the DVD is like being at his great lectures. Dr. Ledwith is an extensively studied scholar of the beginning of Christianity/Judaism/Islam and of the life of Jesus. He bases his lectures on scientific and archaeological fact. I found Dr. Ledwith to be articulate, self-enlightened, powerful yet humble. Committed to truth. This first DVD is excellent.

8059837,4,B0009EXVEO,"Strangely, even though I loved ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" (DVD) and Mr. Ledwith's contribution therein, I was hesitant to purchase this DVD.  However, after watching the DVD I am thoroughly elated I did!  Admittedly, the presentation is in a lecture format, and not as colorful, clever or entertainingly presented as ""What the Bleep"", but the information, and perspective was right on target!

Amazingly, I come from a very staunch Fundamentalist Christian background (where I freely identified myself with the ""Born-Again"" perspective on Christ, the Bible and the afterlife).  During the 20+ years of promoting that perspective I found my inner voice questioning a lot of what ""The Church"" was teaching that didn't seem to match what I understood Christ's message to truly be.  Mr. Ledwith's perspective matches my own spiritual journey and insightful truths!  After resolving the stark contrast between this DVD & ""What the Bleep""'s format, I quickly found myself wanting to shout ""Amen! Preach it, Brother!""

I believe MORE Christians (Fundamentalists, Evangelicals and Catholics, especially), really, REALLY need to sit down and listen to what this man is saying!  It's true, but surely a ""closed mind"" will only find fault in it, because it would be admitting to one's self that maybe, just maybe, we've never truly questioned exactly WHAT IT IS THAT WE BELIEVE about God, Heaven, Hell, Death, Life, Purpose and the Universe.  Most of us willingly subject ourselves to robotic programming by ""the Church"" and never question our belief out of fear... Fear that is TAUGHT to us in the guise of spiritual ""obedient thinking & action"", and all we can do to answer life's questions is seek someone ELSE's viewpoint (those we deem within our Church structure to be ""more knowledgable"", relying on their interpretation to guide us, or quoting scripture (like a good little robot), making sure we ignore the scriptures that we don't want to hear ourselves, or don't quite fit in with the pat little answers we want our listeners to hear (promoting and ignoring scriptures at will).  Most Christians either don't KNOW what the Bible says, or they are just walking automatons spouting verbal rhetoric rather than speaking from our Heart (since that is so much easier than taking responsibility ourselves and finding the answers within... Looking within is too scarey for most, and the Church teaches us NOT to rely on our own understanding, because we are evil without the Church's dogma).  Free your mind and THINK FOR YOURSELF!  Expand your understanding of Scripture beyond the Hamburger Universe! I'm positive even Jesus, the Christ would approve! JOHN 10:34 (Hey, don't stone me! Jesus said it! Isn't everything he said truth, or are only some of the things he said true while other things should be suppressed?).

I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  If nothing else, it will at least provide a different perspective on things... and maybe, just maybe open your mind to consider what it is you do believe and why!

Fundamentalists, Evangelicals and Catholics, are probably the most likey mindsets to ridicule and berate my review and the DVD - no problem though... everyone should seek their OWN inner truth.  Hopefully the truth they do find IS their own, and not one that places them into a neatly package box in which they are snug and secure in the illusion that they never have to truly think for themself again. ;-)
