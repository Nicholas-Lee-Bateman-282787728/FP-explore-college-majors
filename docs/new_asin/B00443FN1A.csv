4259572,5,B00443FN1A,"I don't know about anyone else, but I shrieked with mad, geeky laughter when I found out that there would be a fourth season of ""The I.T. Crowd.""

And once the Britcom geekfest gets going again, it's almost like it was never gone (the familiar cluttered office, the rampant technonerdery, the idiotic plans of the crazy boss). The first episode is a little bland at times, but the five that follow are absolute, sheer brilliance -- plenty of surreal situations, great acting, and general weirdness.

Hoping to get new job opportunities, Jen applies to be the new Entertainment Manager... only to discover that it means being Douglas' ""Fredo"" (ie getting hooker and strippers for his business buddies). Her best bet is to unload the visiting guys on Moss and Roy, but can a RPG game possibly save the day? This episode was a little on the limp side, especially since so much of it focused on Roy deteriorating after a bad breakup.

But things go back to normal in ""Final Countdown,"" in which Moss becomes the new champion of a TV quiz show and is admitted into an exclusive club, while Roy desperately tries to convince an ex-classmate that he's not a window-washer. And in ""Something Happened,"" Douglas tries to convert all his employees to ""Spaceology,"" while Jen dates a staggeringly boring rock musician and Roy suffers a horrifying personal violation (""My trouser hams are not for sale sir!"").

Jen ends up with ""Italian For Beginners"" when she convinces Douglas she can speak Italian, and ends up as his new translator; Roy becomes unhealthily obsessed with his girlfriend's tragic past, and Moss ends up stuck in a vending machine. Roy and Moss decide to be ""Bad Boys"" at a local mall, while Jen frantically tries to fix her virus-riddled laptop. And finally, it's ""Reynholm Vs. Reynholm"" when Douglas' blink-and-you'll-miss-it marriage blows up and he finds himself relying on the IT crowd.

Butt-kissing, brain-dead rockers, D&D, shoplifting DVDs, incoherent Italian, an obscene trophy and Moss giving birth to an iPhone. ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Fourth Season"" piles the increasingly bizarre sitcom problems on our already overburdened, underappreciated IT personnel, and (except for the bland first episode) is a thoroughly satisfying fourth helping.

It still has plenty of brilliant writing, riddled with surreal situations (Moss asks if he can keep a robot he encounters on the street) and weird dialogue (""Fredo, in the film, he was essentially a pimp."" ""No, he took the ring to Mordor!""). And while the IT department's social awkwardness is still the main theme, their problems have become even stranger with time (Moss becomes very jealous when Douglass gets a robot arm).

The three main actors are still utterly brilliant -- Katherine Parkinson's Jen keeps falling afoul of her own technological ignorance and workplace lies, Richard Ayoade's twitchy Moss gets to play the part of a cool guy and/or a delinquent, and Chris O'Dowd's Roy gets hilariously obsessed with a burning sea park, freezes in fear, and comes up with countless euphemisms for his backside in court.

It starts a little shakily, but ""The IT Crowd: The Complete Fourth Season"" doesn't take long to launch itself up into the comic stratosphere. Hilarious, delirious and lots of fun.",1285459200,53,3271,5.044444444444444

Our beloved fools in the basement are still there.  Moss, with his 9:00pm hairdo - how else can one explain that part? - Roy wid his Airsh accent and Jen, who by now knows that the internet is fragile and can be contained in a black box.

The IT Crowd is for the inner dork in all of us.  If you can't laugh at this, you probably need to turn yourself off and on again.",1422316800,3,537,4.115384615384615

You will get so many laughs from the antics of Moss, Roy and Jen - and will probably admit that you've also told someone to ""turn it off and on again"" !!!  As we all know - a reboot will fix about anything !  But I digress....  BUY THE IT CROWD  - because you will love it.  I have all of the seasons on DVD even though they are also showing on Netflix.

The characters were well-drawn and exquisitely portrayed, and while the plot lines sometimes were twisted a bit to squeeze every possible punchline out of them, they were fun, satiric and often admirably clever. I suppose my favorite episode of this season, perhaps of the whole series, is the one revolving around the game show ""Countdown,"" which spoofs everything from The Matrix to Fight Club. Although nominally about IT people in the corporate world, the show's usually ventured far beyond that particular corner and did so with a wonderful twinkle in its eye.

The situations that these characters get pulled into resemble scenes from Seinfeld and The Office, but are original enough that they don't track on old ground.

4259738,5,B00443FN1A,This show is awesome!  Like a cross between Seinfeld and Monty Python's.  Moss is hilarious and the star of the show!  Jen is sexy and great.  Can't get enough.  Sometimes the British do it right!  Watch it. Love it!  I do.,1307232000,3,223,4.2926829268292686
4259739,5,B00443FN1A,"When The I.T Crowd hit its fourth year I wondered how it would fair. After all, four years is a relatively long time for a modern T.V series to keep up steam.  Well, The I.T Crowd is stronger than ever in season four, with none of the self-consciousness or smugness that can set in as a series gains popularity.  The plots are fresh and the characters are in fine form.  I actually think that season four is stronger than season three.  The characters have really matured into their roles, unlike in some series where one or two characters can sometimes sort of grow into the heros and dominate the show.  There is none of that here, fortunately, though Douglas is now involved a bit more than he was previously.

What I loved about the I.T Crowd is the various subplots that crop up in each episode.  Rather than having one basic premise for each show, the writers cleverly intertwine several different off-shoots of the main idea, sometimes branching out into quite unexpected territory.  As someone who lives in North America, this is a huge contrast to most American sitcoms, which tend to have one basic idea per show, which they often bring back in later shows as a running gag.  Not that there's anything wrong with running gags, but when that forms the basis of your laughs for that episode it gets pretty lame.

Anyways, if you've seent he previous series, you will know what to expect.  If not, start with series one and enjoy the introduction of some excellent characters who are both likeable and at times wince-inducing--especially the two Reynholms--but always funny.",1306454400,2,1581,4.733576642335766
4259740,2,B00443FN1A,"Do you like hackneyed, lame writing, over-the-top cheesy comedic acting and embarrassingly bad dialogue? Then this is the show for you.  If you've ever seen Extras, Ricky Gervais spoofs corny British sitcoms and skewers them for being non-threatening and just God awful.  I'm convinced this was the show he was talking about.  The acting is terrible and the laugh track/studio audience gives it a dated 80's sitcom feel, and NOT in a good way.  I honestly tried to give this show a shot many times because of all the glowing reviews but i'm convinced that shows like this appeal to a certain crowd.  Fans of garbage such as two and a half men, how i met your mother and big bang theory will enjoy this drivel.  However, if you like intelligent, well written and hilarious shows such as... curb your enthusiasm, extras, the office, louie, summer heights high, party down, etc then stay away from this.

There were a few chuckles here and there but again the corniness of it really killed it for me.  Not edgy, and trust me i gave it a fair shot, i watched the first 2 seasons because my friend convinced me it was brilliant.  I might have laughed 5 times.  Very disappointing",1305849600,,1174,4.600961538461538

4259755,5,B00443FN1A,"I think this show is hysterically funny. I know taste in comedy varies greatly so if you haven't seen the show you might want to watch some of it first before you purchase. This is my favorite British comedy. To me it is reminiscent of Seinfeld, only updated. It is not a carbon copy, but there is the same twisted sort of humor. If you have other seasons of this and are wondering if you should buy this one, you should! It is the best by far. If you want to see a really good clip just google ""fire at a sea parks.""",1297209600,2,517,4.029126213592233

We have successfully gotten family members young and old hooked on the adventures of Moss and Roy too.  Season 4 is not the place where new viewers to The IT Crown should start, as there are many callbacks to previous seasons that you will not catch (or understand).  Definitely start with season 1.  Graham Lineham caters to the geeks and nerds, and to those who worked on IT help desks.  While some of our favorite episodes are in past seasons, these will certainly be watched over and over again to catch all the nerdy goodness.",1294099200,7,628,4.473684210526316

The tone and pacing of the comedy is spot on, and the characters are interesting, even when they aren't in the spotlight. This series is
truly lightning in a bottle.

If you have not yet seen this show, you owe it to yourself to check it out. Don't feel overwhelmed by the fact that there are 4 seasons, each season is short, and you
could knock out the ENTIRE series in a weekend! MASSIVE FUN!

An absolute treat, 5 huge stars, and my absolute highest recommendation.
