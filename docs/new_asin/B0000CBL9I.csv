1917882,2,B0000CBL9I,"arghhh. this film is incredibly frustrating to watch. not because of the performances; overall the actors were excellent. the cinematography was at times beautiful, sometimes downright odd, but at least it was mostly interesting. it is in the screenplay where this movie fails. one of the most important elements in creating the necessary drama in a tragic love story is to fully engage the viewer in the depicted life and character of its leads. martin is a poolboy who is not so much irrepressible as just plain irritating. lucas is the rather angry and befuddled object of his affection who, after a painfully unbelievable courtship, eventually and inexplicably falls in love with martin. and throughout the rest of the film we watch as martin treats...well, basically everyone who cares about him...REALLY poorly. i find it difficult enough to believe that the initially straight lucas would ever want to spend more than a few minutes with martin, let alone totally turn his life around to begin a romantic relationship with him. not because lucas is mostly straight, but because martin is so miserable. i'm not wrecking any of the plot when i mention that martin is dying of aids. we learn within the first ten minutes that this is so. but since this is an essential element of the plot, shouldn't it serve some sort of purpose? martin does not give the viewer any revelation about life or death. we see no character growth. martin's relationships are actually quite dysfunctional and more than a little abusive. so what are we left with? a love story that doesn't give a whole-lotta-love.
the handsome jean-michel portal gives a genuine and intense performance as lucas. mathilde seigner is wonderful as well. marcial di fonzo bo is actually very believable as a bitter and irritating guy who totally stalks the object of his affection into submission. is this love? is this a deep and moving drama? it certainly didn't feel like it. and it's not the fault of the actors.",1083110400,16,1977,4.904477611940298

Finally, I broke down and rented it and I'm so glad I did!  It's beautifully acted, scripted and it totally moved me.  Of all the gay movies I've seen, this is without a doubt, one of my favorites.  Yes one of the characters has AIDS, but that is so not like the typical American gay flick, where one of the guys has HIV.  This film is done so majestically, I guess, like only the french can do.  Definitely worth seeing,  this it truely a great movie about two men who fall in love with each other.",1082246400,4,635,4.198347107438017

CHAPTER I----Wherein we are introduced to a wondrous and heart-lifting love, a love being given us........

....by the French, who have long been renowned as masters of old-fashioned, romantic film-making, usually involving man and woman. But 'usually' is not the case here, because what they instead bestow upon us is a tale of a 'different kind of love'----one that is showcased in a marvelous, but largely unheralded, 1997 film entitled: ""The Man I Love."" Surprisingly made for French TV, this is an Aids-related story of gay love being found while at the same time being lost. It literally ""vibrates"" with a style that's been pretty much unique to the French. Unique, that is, until the more recent arrival of such gay-themed, American-produced titles as ""All Over the Guy"" and, newer still, ""Latter Days"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" In these productions, US filmmakers at last approach the French in 'realistically' depicting gay love.....and by 'love' I mean a couple's not only making a total commitment to one another but doing so openly (except for ""Brokeback""). Embarrassingly, up until around the year, 2000, American-based directors and their lead male couples never quite appeared to be completely and truly comfortable and at ease in the gay love they were attempting to put across on the screen. But it is just such a high level of comfort and ease which was earlier captured in ""The Man I Love,"" a motion picture in which you can actually visualize love emerging and growing.....something that would seem impossible to capture on film.

Meet now the two male leads with whom we have been gifted:

--MARCIAL DI FONZO BO, as 'Martin'---an Aids victim not yet giving up on life or finding love, who instantly recognizes that love the moment he sees a blond-god of a man appear, in of all places, on the front edge of a high-dive board. 'Martin' until then had nothing to continue living for, but with this new love in his life, the impending loss he faces becomes emotionally catastrophic......for us as well. How this story prepares him for that coming loss, and how we are allowed to watch his setting up a legacy which will buoy his new lover when the loss does occur, is a touching and heart stirring tale.

--Most notably, though, we are presented the beautiful JEAN-MICHEL PORTAL, as blond 'Lucas' (that man on the board), in an uncanny characterization of one who, till now, has known only heterosexual love. Yet in this story he finds himself being faced with emotions of an entirely different nature.....emotions which he invites us in to watch as they ""take him over."" It is Portal's striking performance which allows the audience to actually see the growth and realization of this new, this different kind of love. Through his eyes, his facial expressions, and his body language, he does, indeed, present a love emerging (even though initially resisted) and growing. He begins his journey by almost reluctantly ""giving up"" his female lover/companion, as he commences ""relating"" more and more to 'Martin'. The movie viewer can virtually see his internal feelings for M. developing and ""happening""......it's an experience akin to watching the ""speeded-up-on-film"" opening of a bud to blossom. Another way of saying this is, if you've heard the old expression about a person's ""being bought out of their shell,"" then, here, with Portal's performance you can actually see someone undergoing such a transformation.

CHAPTER II----Wherein we are delightedly introduced to a Michelin Guide's Mother of all Mothers........

....and the French do even this best. Actress, Vittoria Scognamiglio's 'Rose' is a 3-Star wonder to behold. She is every gay boy's ""dream-delight"" of a parent; a someone who even rid herself of a homophobic husband so that 'Martin' could grow to be who he should be.......happily and without fear. There's no one 'Me're Rose' would not take on who might stand in the way of her beloved son's full enjoyment of his time left.

EPILOG / EPILOGUE----Wherein we bid a fond farewell to........

....our two terrific leading men: ""Salut, Martin! // Salut, Lucas!  Thank you for sharing your wonderful journey.""

PS--This is, without doubt, an unusual film experience, and as one earlier reviewer said: ""Repeated viewings only seem to make the story more meaningful."" Now, please let me add: do not hesitate in obtaining it for your personal collection.

1917885,1,B0000CBL9I,"I found this movie to be incredibly simplistic in its ultimate message and its failure to fully develop the characters leave the viewer feeling unfulfilled, and in my case, extremely confused.  The Man I Love immediately introduces that the main character has feelings for Lucas, the straight guy (I'm talking like in the first 5 minutes he is like I love you).  Because of this hurried approach to ignite the love between the two characters, the powerful message in the end becomes undersupported.  For Christ's sake the main guy has AIDS and chases after Lucas, who is struggling with his own sexuality.  So, there are two conflicts occurring simultaneously.  The amount of internal conflict paired with lack of character development (like the viewer doesn't get to know the characters at all, period, the end) causes the movie to ultimately fail in its purpose.  Don't rent this movie, 'cause youll get a huge disappointment.  Rent Burnt Money.  It's awesome!",1076976000,5,962,5.044303797468355
1917886,4,B0000CBL9I,"The depiction on the cover of this dvd/video is somewhat misleading as it tends to lead one to believe that this a superficial ""softporn and eye candy"" type movie. The very opposite is true. While the actors in this film are definitely easy on the eyes they have have a depth of character and emotion that few american gay film characters achieve. I found myself feeling sorrow, attraction, and admiration, all at the same time for the lead character of Martin throughout the movie. The plot is sad and beautiful at the same time with just the right amount of emotion and not too much preachiness given the fact that it is about AIDS and the impending death of one of the characters.
This is a must see if you get the chance.",1075420800,16,725,4.458646616541353
1917887,4,B0000CBL9I,"Perhaps the French do indeed have the market on love stories. THE MAN I LOVE is the improbable tale of a young gay man (Martin) living with AIDS who falls in love with an apparently straight diver and swim coach (Lucas) who comes to work at the Centre Nautique where Martin is the pool boy/janitor. Martin is so comfortable and carefree with his sexuality that he immediately pledges his attraction to the somewhat confused Lucas. Martin follows Lucas home where he lives with an especially lovely young Lise who immediately is infatuated with Martin's ability to use sign language (Lise teaches in a school for the hearing impaired) and encourages the mortified Lucas to include Martin in their social life. Things progress, Martin realizes he is coming to the end of his struggle with AIDS, invites his mother to meet Lucas, and gradually Lucas embraces his bisexuality and falls in love with Martin. All of this story is played (by an exceptional cast) as a simple tale of love and it is because of this honesty that the film succeeds. There is a tendency to push the Act Up movement - Martin's extended family engage in a laying in strike against the hospital for the French government's lack of AIDS research and treatment venues - but even this bit of grandstanding shows passion and compassion in a very real manner. The ending of the film, while edging a bit towards the saccharine, manages to quickly fall back in step and leaves the viewer with a sense of the power of love....as only the French can do! The setting in Marseilles is beautiful, the score is charming, and the mood is warm for a tough subject.",1070582400,71,1618,4.680701754385965
1917888,4,B0000CBL9I,"Few gay themed love stories are as touching and moving as this one between Martin, a gay man, and Lucas, a seemingly straight man whom he has fallen in love with.
Maybe it is the fact that Martin is living with AIDS and realizes that time is precious, or just that he goes after what he wants, but he wastes no filling Lucas in on the way he feels, a feeling which at first Lucas doesn't seem to share.
But the two become friends, and as they do we begin to realize, as does Lucas, that something more is developing, something he never thought possible...or did he? Although he has a girlfriend, Lucas wonders, as does the viewer, if there isn't something missing.
Much of the pleasure of this film is in the small touches as the story unfolds, as we see Lucas come to the realization that this new friendship is developing into something more meaningful. From here the movie unfolds to it's very moving and satisfying conclusion.
You may find yourself wanting to watch this movie more than once, especially when you see how it ends. Repeated viewings only seem to make the story more meaningful.
This movie is a story of coming out, of being true to yourself, and the tremendous power of love.",1069372800,63,1194,4.506912442396313
1917889,5,B0000CBL9I,"A genuinely moving story, The Man I Love (original title: L'Homme que J'aime) centers on the unlikely but potent romance between a straight diver and a gay pool attendant.
The film, in typical French fashion, invites the viewer to look outside convention and towards the deepest potency of true compassion by focusing on more familiar themes like coming out and AIDS. The film quickly draws you into the secret world created by the two lovers as they confront mainstream social expectations as well as grief, doubt, pain, and their personal demons.  In the best possible way, the characters establish themselves as men courageous enough to love unselfishly and care for each other.  Truly a subtle and striking film!",1068681600,35,716,5.059322033898305

The way it is narrated, which inserts into the French way of telling stories, brings a fresh air to movies, particularly the ""gay"" theme movies we are used to see.

What happens after is what this movie is about. How many guys dream they could do that? Well, in this movie you can see what could happen if you did... The French are quite good in producing artsy romance/comedy/dramas with a touch of je-ne-sais-quis that make them so unique. Definitely worth having in your DVD collection.",1124496000,5,478,4.771084337349397
1917893,4,B0000CBL9I,"I was ""forced"" to watch this movie against my will, as it looked like nothing that would appeal to me.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I got caught up with these characters and have difficulty understanding the negative reviews.  The negative rant from ""Atlanta Native"" purports the unbelievability factor. . . and he's gay!  It's a movie, everything and anything is within the realm of the possible. I had no difficulty in Lucas's journey as he slowly falls in love with Martin.  When we meet Lucas he is icy, bitter and removed.  He's accustomed to luxury, having his own way, and used to rules and laws being bent or broken to accommodate him.  His introduction to Martin is a bracing, instantaneous jolt of reality, an indication that the real world is not so perfect.  Martin may (and does) annoy and repulse him, but Lucas has now been shocked out of an existence of an almost catatonic complacency.  Martin annoys and repulses him.

The small ensemble cast are each absolutely perfect and watching their individual journeys is a nice insight into another world.  The cinematography and locations in and around Marseilles are absolutely breathtaking.

This is far more than a gay love story, it's a story about hope, perceptions of reality, taking risks and believing in the magic and glory of the human spirit.  This movie could never have been made in Hollywood.  Thank God for the French, their sensibilities, their language and their movies!",1123027200,15,1449,4.909465020576132
1917894,5,B0000CBL9I,"This is an epic tale of two forbiden lovers caught in a society of bigitry and chaos. The story entales a young Martin whose passion for life is as eminent as his passion for his new love. The incredible Lucas, fit for the part, finds himself in a new state of conscience. Questioning every move he makes. The two meet where they are both employed at a local pool/fitness center. It was attraction from the first for Martin. Lucas however was not as eager. The persistant Martin follows him home where he meets Lucas' live in girlfriend Lise. The three make for the best of friends until the spark between Lucas and Lise dwindles as the kindle between Martin and Lucas is set ablaze. Through hardships and tears, the two find themselves menat to be. Of course, what good is a love story with out the drama. We discover young Martin to have fully evolved AIDS with very little time to spare. To put that twist of irony on the spin, his physician just so happens to be Lucas' father. All seems lost until a lady in pink arrives, Martins mother. Sporting a shabby chic appearance with pink mercedes to match, she bonds the two even closer together until she acualy finds a way to unite the two in marriage. For all the tears and heartfelt emotion, the end draws near as we prepare say good bye to Martin. Lucas and Lise find that although thier love for one another has lost hope, they still have a friendship worth saving. We come to a close. Martin is gone and we all share in Lucas' tremendous loss and grief. Even so, at such a sad time, when we should feel the distraught and mixed emotions, confusion and disaray, we find a simplistic relief as we watch Lucas ride away upon Martins bike with just a hint of Martin still there, riding the handle bars and singing the nation anthem...together at heart - Forever.",1120262400,6,1814,4.466867469879518
1917895,2,B0000CBL9I,"After reading many of the previous reviews for this film, I am struck dumb, wondering if the reviewers had seen the same film I had.

The acting is quite fine, but the storyline has a terribly unbelievable ""fantasy"" premise that has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.

Homosexual swimming pool manager, Martin, falls hard for hot heterosexual diver and lifeguard, Lucas, immediately upon seeing him. He confesses his love to him after knowing him for all of ten minutes.

How old is this guy?

12?

I don't care if he DOES have AIDS. It's stupid. No mature man, ill or not, runs around putting himself at emotional risk in such a short period of time - and this doesn't apply to just gay men. In fact, the very idea that a gay man would approach a straight man after knowing him so briefly and confess his love to the straight man, is patently offensive to me as a gay man. It only furthers the straight Nazi mentality in their belief that we are sick and amoral and out to recruit members.

This stupendously juvenile storyline adds insult to injury when Lucas quite quickly, and without any acknowledgement of prior self doubt or curiosity, up and leaves his live-in girlfriend to begin sleeping with AIDS-stricken Martin.

Think about it peopele - think about when you have ever divulged your homosexuality to a straight man. What was his reaction? What was his reaction when you told him you loved him? If it was positive, can you imagine that it would have been positive had you also told him that you had AIDS? Get real!

We are provided with no information to make us believe that Lucas is any more evolved than most other straight men with regard to homosexuality or AIDS. The only sliver along that thought line is that his father is a doctor who treats men with AIDS. HOWEVER, he and his father haven't spoken in quite a long time.

Lucas, for all intents and purposes, is straight and much like any other straight man (evolved or otherwise) is not inclined to venture into homosexuality unless it is due to alcohol or drugs (my thoughts, not the films). So why is it that it only takes Martin (whom I found to be more than a little annoying) only a few attempts before he's gotten not only Lucas in bed with him, but supporting him at AIDS protests, AIDS functions, gay bars...all without once even batting his eyes at the fact that he is sleeping with someone who is not just sick, but very much dying of the disease.

The transition is far too relaxed and unbelievable. Men, gay or straight, just don't nonchalantly hop into someone's bed once they know their HIV status is positive. It just doesn't happen, unless the person is completely naive (and we know Lucas to be anything but).

Then there's Martin's mother... What an evolved woman! And what good casting! She looks just like Martin (and that's not a good thing). When I saw the character at first - I thought it was a drag queen. This is one seriously homely woman. She has an enormous schnoz and a big ol' head. She's a good actress and I found her dialogue to be very much believable to the situation in which she is.

Now, my best friend is French, so I know them to be the drama queens that Martin is (not an insult, just an observation). So that much is real.

Lucas is just too darned accepting of every problem that comes down the pike. He's not the least bit surprised that he's discovered that he's gay or that his father has discovered it or that his girlfriend has discovered it. (Where's the French emotion here?).

No, I think the reviewers who have really liked this film are hopeless romantics who want their love stories syrupy and maudlin with no hints of reality. I prefer the latter.

Other than the acting and the interesting scenery, The Man I Love was all fairy tale (in more ways than one).

1917896,1,B0000CBL9I,"After declaring his love for the straight Lucas, Martin not only gains his love, he breaks up the heterosexual relationship Lucas was in at the time. (Oops!) Martin then proceeds to spend the duration of the film driving Lucas away. Since he's dying of AIDS, Martin is far too busy playing the martyr to acknowledge the pain his lover and mother are going through. He shows a completely selfish and callous disregard for anyone's feelings but his own. Martin is an insensitive, self-righteous jerk who deserves to die alone.

Martin loves Lukas almost from the first moment they meet and pushes his way, through a series of chance and unlikely events, into Lukas's life and more.

Unfortunately (for me at least) the story is eventually revealed to be yet another dying-with-AIDS gay love story.  It's been done.  Here it is done fairly well, but it isn't very fresh or interesting.  I grew tired of Martin's constant demands of Lukas (do this, do that, get away from me, etc.) and had trouble sympathizing with his occasionally nasty demeanor once the connection with Lukas was made.

That said, there are some touching expressions of love between the boys, including a wonderful wedding and ""Mom,"" who steals the show.  ""Don't hurt my son or I'll put a bullet between your eyes.""  I believed her.

Having said that, it really is about Lucas learning to finally love, and he chose Martin, even though, at times Martin was a bit much and mean towards him. Again, in French culture, it all makes sense.

So all I have to say is that this is a very romantic film, if you understand the culture, if you don't, then yes, it could seem like crap because they didn't have a big Hollywood ending, like you were looking for.",1092009600,14,767,4.34965034965035

The main character starts out quirky and endearing, as he pursues the object of his affection, but eventually he becomes rather irritating.

The movie veers into preachiness as it progresses, which is always a bad sign.  The usual gay equals good, straight equals bad lines are drawn in the sand.  A case in point is the girlfriend of the straight man.  Exactly why we should think badly of a woman who reacts with anger and resentment when her boyfriend leaves her for another man is beyond me.  Does that make her homophobic or intolerant?  I don't think so.  Such a reaction strikes me as the natural one.  Most women, and men for that matter, are not saints, and will feel betrayed when their significant other leaves them for someone else, whether that someone else is a man or a woman.

Both Jean Michel Portal and Marcial Di Fonzo Bo, as well as the rest of the cast, deliver outstanding performances.
The director, without unnecessary drama, dealt with problem of AIDS and its impact on people's lives.
There are, however, some plots and scenes, which are bit unclear. The first I have in mind, is the one where Martin gets fired.
Another one is the scene in the pool, kind of dreamy one, with flowers and young boy swimming by Lucas. What does it stand for?
These few missteps won't change my opinion about this film. It's worth to see. I am still waiting for european release :(

P.S. The cover of the dvd...Only Americans could create such kitchy thing. Don't let you misslead with this little graphic disaster. It has really nothing to do with the content inside.",1305072000,,959,4.674556213017752

The swimming pool scenes are lush as are some of the shots in the French countryside. Although the film is uneven, it certainly has its moments including a demonstration by the French Act-Up organization and a gay wedding orchestrated by Martin's mother, a French Auntie Mame who drives a lavender Mercedes. The film deals with the difficult subject of two lovers, one who is living and the other who is dying.

7998614,3,B0000CBL9I,"The Man I Love is an OK movie...it has some positive elements to it. The story follows Martin, who is HIV+. He meets Lucas, a lifeguard and diver at the pool where he works. Lucas is straight, or so the story goes, and living with Lise. Martin begins a quest, of sorts, to get Lucas into bed, and Lucas eventually realizes that he loves Martin and it goes on from there (don't want to spoil the ending). I think there are a lot of people, including myself, who can identify with the idea of loving someone who seems completely unavailable; Martin at least has the guts to go after him.

What I didn't like was the gigantic leap of feelings, from Martin to Lucas to Lucas to Martin. In the span of the first few minutes, we learn that Martin likes Lucas, a lot, but the movie gives the impression that it's a first meeting (love at first sight?). Lucas seems to struggle with his feelings for Martin but turns around and makes one gigantic leap into love. Another issue was the lack of clarity as to why Lucas loves Martin so much, besides the illness. I think the movie could have benefited from being longer so as not to obliterate a sense of realness for falling in love, especially with a character who is questioning as much as Lucas does.

What I did like is that Martin is not a completely sympathetic character. So many movies portray the dying as heroes. Martin doesn't take care of himself and he uses his illness to manipulate, something that many people with terminal illnesses do (been there, done that). I also loved the cinematography; it's absolutely gorgeous. Can't give this movie 4 stars but I like it well enough to recommend that you see it.",1171065600,,1661,4.478547854785479
