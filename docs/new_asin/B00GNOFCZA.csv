6094320,5,B00GNOFCZA,"This was the kettlebell workout I'd been waiting for!  Amy Dixon puts her unique spin on traditional kettlebell exercises, and does it all in her trademark positive and upbeat style.  I'm an avid home exerciser and have had some experience with kettlebells (Sara Lurie, Jillian Michaels), so I do think it helps to have some training on correct form, although there is a brief tutorial included in this dvd.  I'm a huge fan of Amy's Breathless Body series and was excited to hear she was coming out with a kettlebell workout.  This does not dissapoint.  I used a 15lb bell and was sweating the whole time!  She has two modifiers (beginner and advanced), and gradually introduces the exercises but does it in a way where there is no wasted instructional time.  Will definitely be doing this workout once a week and I will be the first in line to buy her next version!",1387152000,16,866,4.620915032679738
6094321,4,B00GNOFCZA,"I received this KB workout a few days ago. When I did it I used a 8LB KB and I didn't sweat all that much and I wasn't out of breath all that much. I consider myself a advanced exerciser. I workout 5 to 6 days a week for about an hour a day,so I thought I needed a heavier KB and I thought I don't won't to have to go buy another one,so I have 10LB and 12LB dumbbells and I thought huuummmmm I'm gonna try one of the 10LB dumbbells that I have and see how that works out AND you can do this workout with a dumbbell. If someone don't have a KB but you do have dumbbells try it and see how it works for you,it worked fine for me. I think I actually liked using a dumbbell instead of the KB.With the dumbbell I sweated more and my heart rate was up more but of course it was a heavier dumbbell. It lasts right around 40 minutes including warm up and cool down and the time for me flew by. I do like it but will probably use on  lighter days. Cause I'm use to Cathe and HIIT workouts and  more intense workouts. It does have a KB core workout that is separate from the workout it self,the core workout I believe is around 7 minutes. It was ok but I don't plan on using the core work though,I have another core workout that I do that I like alot better,that's just MY opinion. Other people might like the core work better than I did. She does have a modifier on this workout. I do like Amy and I have some of her other workouts she is a good instructor.",1386806400,8,1448,3.905084745762712
6094322,4,B00GNOFCZA,wore me out!,1406592000,,12,3.3333333333333335
6094323,4,B00GNOFCZA,"Loved the workout but had to stop because I have a bad neck and kettle bell made it worse. My friend bought my kettle bell stuff though and loves it. At first I bought a 15 lb bell since I am an avid exerciser. It was much too hard so I got a 7 lb and that felt good until my neck started to worsen. My chiropractor and physical therapist said ""no kettle bells!"" I was sad because the workout is great. So if you have a strong spine... You will love this. Raise Some Bell was the best DVD I bought for kettle bells.",1404432000,,515,3.914285714285714
6094324,5,B00GNOFCZA,"This is a great work out.  I am a big fan of Amy Dixon and the kettlebell workout is challenging but great for abs.  Highly recommend. Plus, two workout options (bonus add on of abs).",1399680000,2,183,4.2
6094325,4,B00GNOFCZA,I have used Jillian Michaels KettleBell workout and others and this one was different.  I thought it would be easy since I had mastered all levels of Jillian Michaels but I was definitely feeling it the next day.  I like Amy's cuing and her moving quickly through the exercises without a lot of chatter.  I would definitely recommend this.  Kettle Bells are the new 'best exercise secret' these days and you feel the cardio burn without a lot strain with lifting.,1396569600,,463,4.679012345679013
6094326,5,B00GNOFCZA,Just long and difficult enough before getting bored or dreaded.  Amy is direct with her instructions and does not continue to gab; exercises are effective and targets specific muscles.,1395964800,,184,5.344827586206897
6094327,5,B00GNOFCZA,Awesome kettlebell workout. Amy keeps you motivated and moving.  I really worked up a good sweat doing this workout.  Really liked how happy and positive Amy is.,1395014400,,161,4.925925925925926
6094328,5,B00GNOFCZA,"I have several of Amy's DVDs. This is one of my new favorites.
I also got another kettlebell DVD for Christmas (by someone else, and my first kettlebell DVD) then I ordered this and this is a hundred times better. Great job Amy!",1393977600,2,228,4.325581395348837
6094329,4,B00GNOFCZA,"This workout is definitely fast paced and you need to be in reasonable shape to do it.  Amy blasts through the routines so if you are switching out weights, you'd better work fast to keep up.  I bought this to add some variety to my weekly workouts and so far I like it.",1392422400,,270,4.0754716981132075
6094330,3,B00GNOFCZA,"I had expected something more fast paced, challenging. The repetition count is low, and you don't get the exhaustion feeling as with other KB workout (Jillian Michaels is my fave). I tried to get heavier with the KB, but not all the exercises admit a heavier KB, so you end up feeling just a little tired, not covered in sweat as Amy (which, on the other hand, I found pretty awkward). It the DVD were $10, I this wouldn't be a major issue, just leave it for the recovery days. But it's $20 and I believe it doesn't live up to expectations.

Sorry Amy, I really like your work... but this one is not your best.",1391731200,4,610,4.258620689655173
6094331,4,B00GNOFCZA,I love Amy and own most of her videos. She's encouraging w/o being obnoxious and gets you moving w/o feeling bored with repeating movements.,1391472000,,140,4.875
6094332,4,B00GNOFCZA,"This is a hard kettlebell workout. Definitely not for the beginner. If you are still learning how to maneuver the bell properly without injuring yourself, this video is not for you. I just modify the parts that seem to risky for myself, and still get a great workout, but I could see how some people would hurt their wrists or other areas trying to keep up with Amy.",1391472000,,366,4.397058823529412
6094333,5,B00GNOFCZA,"I had spent some time looking for a kettlebell workout and finally bought this one as I have enjoyed her HIIT workouts quite a lot. I did this workout for the first time tonight with a 10 lb kettlebell. There were portions that I could not do at the tempo they did it, but Amy always said during the workout to do it at your tempo if you couldn't keep up. I have read so many good things about kettlebell workouts so I'm excited that I finally have one to put in my workout rotation. The time went by very quickly and there weren't any exercise repeats (unlike with the Jillian Michaels workouts that I also do, and that can sometimes induce the dread factor for me.)

I'm also very pleased that I have a lot of room to grow with this workout. I can aspire to a 15 lb kettlbell, and also to increasing the amount of times I do the advanced moves and keeping up with the pace during all of the moves.

As another note, I have never been a fan of working out my arms. They have always been weaker than my legs and I don't like most traditional free weight arm strengthening moves. Because these moves were different from what I'm used to, and because they combined with leg movement much of the time, I didn't notice the arm workout aspect nearly as much, despite my arms currently telling me that they will be hurting tomorrow.

I'm so happy that I have found Amy Dixon. I also like Jillian Michaels, and I've done some Insanity workouts and Bob Harber, but the more I do Amy's workouts, the more she is growing on me. She doesn't put down the other people doing the workouts with her, and her positive attitude is not annoying, but helps instead to raise my effort and energy level.",1391126400,2,1682,4.299684542586751
6094334,5,B00GNOFCZA,"I have a lot of workout DVDs and own and love all of the Breathless Body DVDs from Amy Dixon. I am less inclined to do strength training, especially for upper body, so I really needed something that I like enough to stick with that challenges me and works upper body well. Since I love Amy's other workouts, I decided to give this one a try. I've done kettlebell in workouts in the gym before but never a full kettlebell workout. Since I'm intermediate to advanced, I got a 12-lb bell. Here are my thoughts on this:

1. Whoa. It's a challenge if you're like me and don't typically do much upper body strength. For once in a workout of hers, I was sticking with the modifier for a good bit of it, not comfortable jumping into lunges while trying to swing a 12-lb weight overhead with one arm!
2. Like her other workouts, this flows very well and goes by fast. I attribute that to the fact that she has you do a drill for several minutes and then moves on to something completely different. No going back to a standard KB swing for endless minutes to transition.
3. BURPEES! They suck, and I hate them. I didn't expect there to be burpees, and I'm tempted to remove a star for that! LOL. That drill was tough, but I did it. Actually, had to take a sec.
4. Some of her moves are a little complicated, but I think they'll be easy to do once I'm used to them. Again, I think her workouts go by quickly because they're not the same old, same old that we've all been doing in every other dvd.
5. I LOVE that she doesn't have smiley, happy Barbie dolls working out with her. Of all my dvds, only Amy Dixon and Bob Harper seem to get that it's not normal to have a fake smile plastered on one's face while being worked to the max. I love Turbo Fire, but I can't stand the fake smiles. Amy is real, and so are the people working out with her. She enjoys it, but there's no fake here.
6. I was glad this was only 40 minutes. I do 55-65 min cardio workouts, but I really didn't want to do this any longer, especially since it's so much shoulder work. I think it was just long enough.
7. It's as much cardio as you want it to be. I wanted to focus on getting the strength moves down and feel that I do enough cardio in my other workouts, so I opted out of most of the jumps. But if you want some cardio moves, she gives you that option.

Great job, Amy!",1391126400,3,2340,4.106986899563319
6094335,1,B00GNOFCZA,"I was so excited to receive this dvd,as I have been using kettlebells for years,but many dvds are just plain boring. This dvd was just way too crazy-fast side lunges while swinging a kettlebell  is just way too risky. I felt that throughout the entire dvd I had to modify,as Amy moved way too fast and her movements seemed so jerky at times-I did finish the entire dvd but felt more frazzled then worked. It seemed that all I could think about while doing the workout is""How do I not slam a 20 pound kettlebell into my knee?"".I am an experienced kettlebell user and honestly hated this one",1390608000,36,589,4.453703703703703
6094336,5,B00GNOFCZA,"This was my first time doing an Amy Dixon workout and I was impressed.  I must say it was challenging for me, but not impossible (meaning, I did not turn it off after 10 mins feeling discouraged). Since I have not worked out in a while and I am over weight, I switched between a 5 pound and a 10 pound kettlebell and did the modified version.  I still worked up a sweat and felt my legs and core really working.  Here are the things I liked.
1.  No cheesy background music or constant talking.
2.  There are two people in the back that can show you the modified version and the advance.
3.  Amy doesn't go around talking or screaming at them to do better.
4.  There is a kettlebell 101 so you can get familiar first and know the proper forms.
5.  The fact that I am starting out at a very basic pace this gives me the room to try the advanced moves and a heavier weight.
6.  Time time it took. she has a great warm up and cool down, the actual lifting is about 35 mins.  So you can do this when  pressed for time.

I hope my review helped.",1390262400,13,1039,4.014634146341463
6094337,4,B00GNOFCZA,"My only complaint is that is that it's quite quick.  I prefer to workout for a whole hour and this is more like 40 minutes from start to finish.  That said, it really does get your heart pumping and her instruction is spot on.  I like to workout HARD and this is challenging to me.  I found it a better kettle bell routine than the Jillian Michaels Shed and Shred.  As always Amy gives you very precise directions and a great workout - I just wish it were longer.",1390176000,2,463,4.157303370786517
6094338,5,B00GNOFCZA,"This is a great workout: It's challenging, gets your heart rate up, and has some interesting moves to hold your interest. I think you need to be familiar with kettlebells and have some experience doing workouts with them to be happy with this video. It is not something I would classify as a beginner workout. Some of the moves are complex, there are a lot of repetitions in some sets, and the reps move quickly. As a point of reference, this video is definitely a step up from Paul Katami's Beginner Kettlebell DVD (A great DVD, by the way, and a good place to start. It has a nice tutorial, too.) I would also place this workout as more advanced than Jillian Michael's Shred it with Weights kettlebell workout. Another note: you may need to use a lighter weight than what you are accustomed to. I have been using a 7lb kettlebell, and I am pretty much ready to move up to something heavier. The high reps in this video were pushing me to my limits with the 7lb bell. In summary: This is a great workout for someone familiar with kettlebells and ready to be challenged. Get the bell you would use for high reps and enjoy.",1389916800,6,1122,4.399038461538462
6094339,5,B00GNOFCZA,"I am at an intermediate to advanced level and this workout was just right for me.  I used my 15 pound bell for most of the workout.  At times (for the swings) I could have gone heavier...  and probably will the next time I try it.  For certain moves, like the jerks and chops, I went lighter with my 8 pound bell.  I liked how there was not much rest between moves...  she just went from one move to the next to keep the heart rate up.  I liked the variety of moves, as well.  Just lots and lots of different and interesting moves.  And all body parts were worked.  I really liked the back-up people, too.  They genuinely seemed to be enjoying the workout and they weren't the stock fitness models that a lot of backup people seem to be.  They seemed to be regular people who were working hard right along with us.  Amy is motivating and enthusiastic and she is good about making form pointers along the way.  I would not do this as my first kettlebell workout.  I would certainly try to learn the proper form from other videos (dvd's or you tube) before attempting a workout like this.  I was experienced with kettlebells before attempting it, myself.  the only thing I didn't like was a certain move called the rainbow.  I didn't feel as though it was a very safe move...  I guess if  your bell was light enough and you were careful and experienced...  but especially going through this the first time with a relatively heavy bell, I didn't like that move.  in the future, I plan to just do regular swings when they are doing the rainbow.  Also, the snatch is quite a difficult move.  I know how to do it because I have practiced it over and over by watching dvd's and you tube videos.  So I am fine with that move, and it is one of my favorites.  but it could be tricky for someone unfamiliar with kettlebells.",1389312000,12,1813,4.3056379821958455
6094340,3,B00GNOFCZA,"The DVD is adequate, not great or totally interesting, but gets the job done.  Some of the work is not doable no matter what shape you are in. I am not sorry I bought it, just wish it was a little more fun.",1388880000,,206,3.7906976744186047
6094341,5,B00GNOFCZA,I have been wanting a good kettlebell workout since I tried them on Amy's Give Me Ten. I've tried a few that were just too much. This is perfect! Thank you Amy for another great workout!,1388102400,2,186,4.194444444444445
8625153,1,B00GNOFCZA,"I did 5 minutes of this and knew it wasn't for me.  I have several DVD's and this one perhaps is just too advanced but even aside from that it just seems over the top.  I mean even the warm up is ridiculous.  She's just not my style at all.  All my DVD's say don't do two armed swings that go higher than your head and she is just way too ""spastic"" for lack of a better word.  If you're in great shape then you may really like this but even if you are I think she'd take some getting used to.  Not my cup of tea.",1507852800,,512,3.7383177570093458
8625154,5,B00GNOFCZA,The best kettlebell DVD I own Amy Dixon never disappoints,1507248000,,57,4.8
8625155,1,B00GNOFCZA,Not a fan of this DVD. It moves really fast and I felt I was 6 moves behind the whole time. Made for a frustrating work out.,1498608000,,124,3.6296296296296298
8625156,5,B00GNOFCZA,Great workout!,1487548800,,14,6.5
8625157,5,B00GNOFCZA,"Intense and fun!  I love this DVD because it incorporate a lot of new moves for me, and I have been using kettlebells for almost 5 years.  The time flies by and I love how I was doing moves ranging from push up variations, to overhead swings, to burpees with the kettlebells. I highly recommend this kettlebell workout!",1482969600,,319,4.482758620689655
8625158,5,B00GNOFCZA,Love it. Never boring. Gives results. I love Amy Dixon as a kettlebell trainer from FitnessGlo as well.,1455062400,,103,4.777777777777778
8625159,5,B00GNOFCZA,Love Amy Dixon.  Love an exercise DVD that takes you straight to the workout instead of forcing you to listen to a five-minute intro.  You'll get results with this workout!,1454112000,,172,4.7
8625160,5,B00GNOFCZA,I Loved this workout!!! It does go a little fast at times but the more I do it the better and stronger I get.  I am very happy with this workout.,1445644800,,145,3.6774193548387095
8625161,5,B00GNOFCZA,This is a really great kettlebell video - it has a lot of moves I have never even seen before and that's great! It's a little short - I prefer longer videos BUT it packs a big punch into the short amount of time. I love that the core segment keeps my heart rate up. Definite must have if you are into kettlebells!,1423180800,,313,3.984126984126984
8625162,2,B00GNOFCZA,"I love Amy Dixon's Breathless Body DVD's and since we started doing kettlebells this seemed like the natural progression.  Nope.  Not a fan.  It's got some awkward choreography and she's trying so hard to come off extreme on some things, one of the moves actually injured me and I'm in good shape.  We gave it another try and I just did another move when that particular move came up but we both said we didn't like it and took it out of rotation.  It'll get donated.  Bummer.",1414540800,3,476,4.413793103448276
