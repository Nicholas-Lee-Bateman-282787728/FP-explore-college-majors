8378389,5,B002R6BJ4Q,"Daphne Zuniga (SPACEBALLS), Duncan Regehr (THE MONSTER SQUAD) and Lisa Ryder (JASON X) star in this brilliant thriller about a wife searching for the truth about her dead husband. I mainly purchased this movie because ever since I first saw THE MONSTER SQUAD, I have been trying to collect the movies of Duncan Regehr. This movie is good but I haven't seen all of it. It is good so far. I will try to update in the near future. 5 out of 5 star rating.",1267315200,,451,4.317647058823529
