8207718,5,B000T47J56,"Had this on Laser Disc format and was considering paying to have transferred to DVD. Much cheaper and easier route.  Thankfully this was available in an import edition.  If you like Queen, you will most likely love this disc.  Mixture of studio and live performances as well as a couple of early music videos.  Seller was quick with shipping and product was exactly as described.",1486944000,,379,4.7846153846153845
