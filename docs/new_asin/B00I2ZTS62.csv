8638526,4,B00I2ZTS62,"That admirable sentence comes from a very old film from Truffaut's masterful film ""The woman next door"" (starred by Depardieu)  and fits adequately to this picture. The long journey between two friends which leads them from the early stage of childhood to the years of maturity. Both are from Argentina, she is Jewish and him descends from a Nazi officer. Nevertheless both struggle in order to make their dreams come true but each one to its own.

Watchable and introspective. A nice treat!",1474502400,,491,4.903614457831325
8638527,4,B00I2ZTS62,"A well-made period piece involving friendship, love and political activism in Argentina and Germany. I was interested because it contains references to some of the very troubling history of unprosecuted Nazis living comfortably and publicly in post-WWII Argentina.",1456876800,,264,5.973684210526316
