7020217,1,B00TQE9SHC,"I never thought that the Pesaro Rossini Festival would ever fall in the gutters of Eurothrash opera. They almost did it with Sigismondo, but this Guillaume Tell is too much. I never thought that Guillaume Tell is one of Rossinis best operas but it does have some good music. It is best to play the disc without video. The staging, the costumes, the settings, the outrageous Pas de Six choreogaphed by Dr. Jekyll, the
shoeless scene are horrendous. One feels no pity for the oppressed people. It is an abuse of the talent of good singers who still unexplainably participate in such monstruosities for money. One star for the singers.",1434067200,6,632,4.754545454545455
7020218,3,B00TQE9SHC,"The production isn't bad if you buy opera to ""see"" opera, but the singing is hardly up to par, and that starts with Florez, who is wearing out his voice and who tires uncomfortably by the last act when he's needed most.  The Tell is barely adequate, but Matilda is quite strong.  It's interesting that I've had a mostly hate/little it of love thing with the Gedda/Bacquier/Caballe recording, and have found that the mechanics of listening to it make a great difference.  Gedda's stab at the role is painful in some settings but works, just, in others, so i'm more favorably inclined to that for the music now.  The Chailly is pretty wonderful all around.  Pavarotti, in the studio, does not tire, to say the least, and add Mirella Freni and Sherrill Milnes and there's some singing going on.
Finally, for a video and good music, Muti gets my slightly begrudging respect.  There's still something a little ""gray"" about the approach and the sound that put me off, but here again there is an Arnoldo who can sing the damn thing.  I don't know who complains about Merritt's ""production"" (sounds like British crap to me, they resent the fact he doesn't have choirboy training that makes him sound like he's got something stuffed up his sinuses), but Merritt can sing the thing, beautifully, with strength and subtlety.  Likewise Studer, and I love Zancanaro, great figure on stage and a real, natural, full Italian baritone.
So I was hoping for great things from this new recording, but will return to Muti.",1433721600,4,1502,4.75
7020219,4,B00TQE9SHC,"Loved the voices; loved the chorus; didn't care for the presentation at all. The horses and the movie cameras were -- I can't think of a word that describes them. The choreography was almost silly. But the music, the cast and the orchestra make the DVD worth the purchase. Juan Diego Florez is at the top of his form.",1432252800,11,317,4.389830508474576
7020220,2,B00TQE9SHC,"As I ""worship at the altar"" of Juan Diego Florez, I was anticipating the arrival of this performance.  What a major disappointment!  First of all the singing was from good to excellent.  JDF was excellent as usual.  However, even though opera is about singing, this production was so bad, that it distracted from the fine singing happening on stage.  The singers are miked, so there is no sense of dimension, depth or movement.  The chorus is not miked and at times they are inaudible.  The orchestra sounds as if it were in another building.  I can't imagine why Decca would commit this performance to DVD unless it was to make money on JDF's presence.
The production is beyond description, it is almost funny.  In the second act, stuffed horses are used for the hunting scene.  They are later placed on their sides and are used as chairs for the cast.  In the third act, Arnold laments over the death of his father, while sitting on the corpse of a decapitated horse!  It is one silly thing after another.
And my last outrageous comment is that this is really not a great opera.  There is of course, Arnold's famous aria and cabeletta in Act 4 and a few other duets that are memorable but otherwise it is boring.  The ballets (two of them) are excellent for bathroom and smoke breaks.  Don't buy this, hopefully something better will come along.",1432252800,28,1347,4.600840336134453
7020221,4,B00TQE9SHC,"I received this disc (purchased in Europe, where releases a frequently earlier than here in the US) and watched the first two acts of this nearly five hour production. Musically, vocally, visually and sonically it is close to perfection. Staging nearly ruins it, since stage director Graham Vick uses Tell to make a political statement, much as he did with the ROF's Mose in Egitto, released a couple of years ago. When the curtain shows a clenched fist against a red backdrop, one does not need a doctorate in history to sense what Vick is up to this time.

But, gentle reader, the music trumps, as it does in Mose in Egitto. Conductor Michele Mariotti wrings more from the old warhorse overture than I have heard before, and his reading of the score maintains a very high level of excellence.

Nicola Alaimo is a very satisfying Tell, both musically and dramatically, even though he casts a large shadow. Marina Rebeka (Matilde) does about the best ""Sombre foret"" as these old ears have heard, and continues to sing and act brilliantly. JDF ""hits it out of the park"" as Arnold; I have never heard him perform as well, and I have listened to him a LOT!  Amanda Forsythe in the en travesti role of Tells son Jemmy has a lovely lyric soprano with ample power to sing over ensembles when required to do so.

Tell is blessed with some of the most memorable choruses in opera and the choral work here shows them off superbly.

The Act I ""ballet"" is performed, but horribly. The ""dancing"" seems to mimic severely neurologically compromised folks having seizures, rather than young couples getting married.

I have gotten past the nearly sacriligeous treatment of the Moses story by director Vick, because, as with Tell, the musical performance is of a uniformly high quality. Tell is too good to languish unplayed on a shelf, and another version is unlikely. Rossini's last opera is a joy to hear, even as a Graham Vick tribute to Communism.",1429574400,27,1936,4.71301775147929

7020223,4,B00TQE9SHC,"Since everyone else seems to concentrate on the production, Ill start with it. Surprisingly, I had less issues with it than I expected. Being born in USSR, Im allergic to clenched fists and red flags, but come to think about it, a concept of moving a story about peoples revolt against oppressive power to the beginning of 20th century does make sense. Vick brought some interesting ideas to the table and several scenes are resolved rather well, like Geslers party (yes, offensive and gruesome but with great attention to details and characterizations); or a storm; or a use of a projector in Asile hrditaire; or a grand finale. Set itself I thought is very good, minimalistic but multifunctional; costumes are attractive. Dances, cameras and some business about mass wiping of the soil from white metallic floor in the 1st act were plainly bad. But what really bothered me though, that it seems that the only thing Vick was interested in was resolving mass scenes, as for me, opera lives or dies on individual performances of the leads. It looked like the trio of main protagonists  Tell, Arnold and Mathilde  was left completely to their own devices while working on their characters. All three of them are gifted actors and did well, but I cant help but think that if a good director just when thru roles with them, just you know - This was great, keep it; that doesnt work, stop doing it, the end result mightve been infinitely better.
Now, to the music making, and here things are undoubtedly great. Starting with overture, that under baton of Michele Mariotti is simply breathtaking. You can hear each instrument singing in its own voice and yet all of them together create a harmony that is out of this world. Orchestra and chorus sound wonderful thru the whole evening. Florez sings beautifully and passionately for hours, arriving in top shape to the key moment of the evening - Asile hrditaire. Aria and cabaletta sound flawless - his legato line is exquisite, tone is gorgeous, high notes are huge and the depth and the range of the feelings he is able to express is amazing. I loved Marina Rebeka too. Her voice is crystalline pure and powerful, her phrasing is very intelligent and tasteful. Tender affection between Arnold and Mathilde felt very real. Nicola Alaimo is an imposing Tell. He has enough power, energy and charisma for the role, but for me, his voice lacks refinement that we expect from ROF top performers. All supporting roles are cast very strongly, Amanda Forsythe does a wonderful Jamie, Veronica Simeoni is fine as Hedwige, Luca Tittoto gives very detailed and properly demonic performance as Gesler. The only disappointment for me was Celso Albelo, just awful on all levels.
Overall, I feel like its an important production, the one that a lot of future ones will be compared with. I sincerely hope that the same conductor will be able to repeat it with for the most part the same cast but with a different director, the one that will put emphasis on the feelings of the characters, not only on class and nations struggles. That was in a heart of romanticism after all, wasn't it?",1446076800,2,3115,4.777365491651206

7020226,3,B00TQE9SHC,"I ordered this in advance from overseas and was looking forward to the first new William Tell on video in over 20 years since the La Scala with Studer, Merritt, Zancanaro and Muti.

I watched this video with interest twice and came away unsatisfied, so I put it aside and watched it again after two months, with greater understanding. In that time I had also received the new video from the Wildbad Festival on Bongiovanni, which really put things in perspective.
Decca's blu-ray sound picks up the orchestra well (for a thrilling overture), but the situation changes once the voices begin and the perspective shifts.

The stereo soundtrack is at a higher level and favors the voices, but the voices are mostly picked up by body microphones which robs them of resonance and gives no sense of the space. The effect is of singers singing separately in a spread-out studio, but this opera is about a small, poor community in the mountains.
I was instead sometimes reminded of those ""duet albums"" where the singers are recorded at different times.

The only sense of the space is when a chorus is singing, as opposed to the Wildbad set where the stage is smaller and more in tune with the actual time, and you get a real sense of the characters singing and interacting together. I found it much more satisfying, and the drama much more immediate.

The Wildbad crew were much better actors as well, and despite their production being lower budget, sang at a very high level. The orchestral detail was not as deep, but there was an integrity to the whole production. I was very surprised and once again reminded that in the face of a gripping performance, technical issues are secondary. In this casse there are so many distractions as to be crippling.

One of the artistic issues here is that the role of Arnold Melchtal is too heavy for Florez, and while the body mic brings up his volume, his voice is very lean compared to the others in the cast.
His voice has been perfect for romantic earlier bel canto roles, but this role shows his limitations, and some wear.
I suspect that this production has been skewed to accomodate Florez' small voice, with unfortunate consequences.
Michael Spyres in Wildbad has  a right-sized voice for the role and sings and acts convincingly.

I have a real problem with the ballet sections. The choreography is immature and insulting. In Act 1, writhing around on the floor, in Act 3, simulated degradation and rape going on for ten minutes. So, make your point maturely in 30 seconds and move on to fill in background atmosphere and story. Rossini's score here is not about ten minutes of rape, after all. Wildbad uses schuhplattler, and other Swiss folk dances which adds to the production, and fits the music.

A recurring theme in this production is stuffed horses, as in taxidermy. Standing up, on their side, being sat on, being walked around. It's creepy.

For me, there's an annoyance factor, and too much in this production annoyed me and left me cold. There are some good performances and staging, but not enough.

We've had a veteran La Scala video available since 1991 with its own staging shortcomings, but solid performances that let me fill in the gaps with my imagination, without the distractions of extended rape scenes and stuffed horses.

Rossini wrote this as a Grand Opera for Paris. One day I hope to see a fittingly grand production, but given the subject matter it might best be a movie filmed on site - an unlikely prospect given the commercial potential.

Meanwhile, the La Scala plus the new Bongiovanni DVD from Wildbad (with better sound than this production) will do just fine.
Not the result I expected.",1438560000,2,3665,4.745283018867925
7020227,5,B00TQE9SHC,"The best performance of Rossini's best opera (live, no less)! A must for all lovers of extraordinary musical theater! The only name I was very familiar with was Juan Diego Flrez (and the Bologna forces). Though the Peruvian tenor proved - quite easily - that he can sing one of the most demanding tenor roles (and do it all over again after having a sip of water!), I won't forget the names of his colleagues!",1437868800,,409,4.466666666666667
7020228,5,B00TQE9SHC,"""William (Guillaume) Tell was the 39th and last opera written by Giochino Rossini (in French).  Rossini, then 37 was the most famous person  of the world of music. He was known all over Europe in it's royal courts and wealthy palaces. He was now to receive a royal pension (from Charles X of France) he lived very well in Paris, directed an important theater, and was happily married. He decided to do one last great opera for the greatest opera house in the world, the Opera Paris. This meant it was to be long, have a ballet and a complex plot. Guillaume Tell is all that. In it he displays his very best talents of lyric line, dramatic story telling and descriptive orchestration. He was truly at the pinnacle of his world.
The opera is a long one; some four hours of a very varied mix of a people's struggle for freedom from the oppressive German Empire of the Hapsburg in the 15th century and some sub plots. It is not often done uncut but this recording purports to be (sans ballet). This effort is absolutely beautifully sung by an excellent cast and the orchestra is in top form and excellently led by maestro Michele Marioti,  The production directed by Graham Vick is wretched! It is so extreme as to be unrecognizable as  being about 15th century Switzerland and the emancipation of it's people. It starts with curtain rising up with the  red clenched fist ( an early symbol of Communist Russia used by Shostakocich in his 1930 ballet ""Bolt"").
If it weren't for the tremendous efforts done by the cast and orchestra, I'd have chucked the whole thing.
But the cast is great! As Arnold, the son of a Swiss hero in love with a Hapsburg princess we have Juan Diego Florez. He has made a career of singing beautifully and artfully, especially music of Rossini. We now see him matured into a believable dramatic  actor and singer who can take on a wide range of dramatic roles. Excellent! As the hero of the drama Nicola Alaimo plays  William Tell himself. His Tell is robust, blunt, heroic and totally believable. He has the heft of voice and body to be a bold leader of men. The nasty that the Swiss have come to hate is the Governor Gesler played wonderfully by Luca Tittoto. That leer on his face is unforgettable. Gesler is murdered  off stage in this production; in the 1991 production (in Italian) of Ricardo Muti he is shot by arrow in a boat. The present production is correct according to the score.
Mathilde the Hapsburg princess has much of the most beautiful music. Her Romance in Act 2 ""Sombe foret"" is glorious, and it was very well done by Marina Rebeka  in her Theda Bara outfit.( I did like her array of costumes). (In the 1991 Muti recording an even more glorious Mathilde was Cheryl Studer.) Last but not least is little Jemmy, William Tell's son. Played by Amanda Forsythe, she has much to do and much to  sing  and do it boyishly. As mentioned before, the orchestra was topnotch. Some of the affects on stage were effective, but much was just plain silly.",1436227200,6,2982,4.534450651769087
7020229,5,B00TQE9SHC,excellent performances by all; Juan Diego Flores is as close to perfect as you will ever see.  Orchestra is especially fine; loved the english horn solos.,1435708800,,154,4.923076923076923
7020230,5,B00TQE9SHC,4.5 hours is gone without realising it... the music of the opera is way too beautiful that it keeps you wanting to hear it again and again. Marina and Diego at their peak!!,1434672000,,172,4.242424242424242
7020231,4,B00TQE9SHC,"This performance of Rossini's final opera was released on the heels of the recent Naxos Guillaume Tell that is available in both audio and video versions.  It's other main competition among virtually complete French versions is the Classic EMI audio only set from the 1970's.  While there are complete versions of this piece in Italian translation, the music is so typically French that the Italian language tends to distort its contours.  As such a robust Italianate approach should ideally be avoided.

If this were an audio only recording it would have received a higher rating.  However, the visual aspects of the production are so off base that I doubt one would want to view it repeatedly after the initial viewing.  Personally, I will most likely be listening only to the audio in the future.

The title role is effectively portrayed by a rather rotund Nicola Alaimo.  Tell is a larger than life character and the sheer size of the man only serves to reinforce that aspect of his persona. As such, Alaimo is forceful and commanding when required, yet he is able to modulate his voice when he must depict the tormented loving father and spouse.  He is almost as good in the role as is Bacquier on EMI and a bit better than Foster-Williams on Naxos.

Juan Diego Flrez sounds glorious as Arnold with his trademark bright, if overly monochromatic, sweet tone.  It is consistently like a laser beam of passionate sound.  In a sense it is too much of a good thing.  The voice is so distinctive that he cuts through the opening ensembles and threatens to overpower Alaimo in their first act duet and so much so that by this point one gets the feeling that the piece should have been billed as Arnold!  He really sounds too Italian for this piece where I hear a softer francophone type voice and especially at the phrase ""Ah, Matilde..."" in that aforementioned duet.  Compared to both Gedda (EMI) and Spryes (Naxos), while they both take the high notes in full voice, their sound is softer, rounder, and more in tune with the French language. They also phrase with more nuance.  In the subsequent scenes where the warrior comes out in him as opposed to the lover, JDF's approach seems more apt as he morphs into the militant rebel.  Furthermore, he phrases the call to arms in his final cabaletta in a quite convincing manner.  In summary, JDF certainly does not disappoint.  His heroic tone proves to be effective even if it is not in the French manner.  While he is more Italianate than ideally should be the case, his ardent approach still works in the final analysis.  My only other criticism concerns the fact that his acting seems wooden compared with previous outings, but that may be the fault of the stage director.

Initially soprano Marina Rebeka sounds slightly more robust than Caball (EMI) or Howarth (Naxos) who both sing with softer tones in ""Sombre foret"".  However, elsewhere she is quite effective and especially in the opening pages of her third act aria.  Fortunately she modulates her tone splendidly for the sublime cabaletta that crowns that aria.  She embellishes the repeat interestingly.  However, her decorations don't really improve on Rossini's original thoughts.

The secondary roles are all done quite well with a special mention to the Jemmy of Amanda Forsythe who gets to sing her often cut third act aria and the Hedwige of Veronica Simeoni.  The Gessler of Lucca Tittoto, while fine vocally, is unfortunately portrayed as a total buffoon in this production and that is the fault of the stage director. Only Celso Albelo as the fisherman Roudi slightly disappoints.

This brings us to the staging of Graham Vick, which is typically controversial to say the least.  However, it is not thought provoking as some of his previous productions have been.  We are in the early Twentieth Century with a unit set that is sparse and frankly ugly.  The staging of the second act is indeed hideous with stuffed carousel horses positioned all over the stage. That of the third act is even worse as it takes place in a room with plush furniture, with the ballet a total disaster in an overly and overtly symbolic sort of way.  Gessler's hat is a formal top hat and the Swiss are made to crawl under the furniture so as to grovel before it.  Even the infamous apple is a green colored Granny Smith!  Nothing makes sense!  Furthermore Gessler's appearance in the fourth act is frankly risible as if we are suddenly in a Rossini opera buffa and specifically Il Barbiere di Siviglia where Gessler makes a ""Don Basilio like"" final appearance for one more ""Buona sera"" only with more fatal results.  At the end of each act the curtain rises as opposed to falling.  It is again symbolic, but silly.  It is unfortunate that the production is so problematic. However, the music carries the day. In fact seeing the ugly set makes its lushness all the more apparent, such is the disconnect.  Fortunately Rossini is able to withstand all this abuse and in spite of the ridiculous staging the musical performance that it inspires is still able to move and provoke strong feelings in the listener.  That it entrusted to conductor Michele Mariotti who has a fine orchestra and chorus at his disposal certainly helps.

I have always thought of Verdi's Don Carlos as being the most effective French Grand Opera ever composed. Now, after listening to two different uncut performances of Tell in the space of a few short weeks I'm not so sure if Tell is not its virtual equivalent. Only the chorus that introduces the apple scene is a letdown. But then again that might have been intentional as it sets the superficial Austrians apart from their sincerely patriotic Swiss counterparts.  It is interesting that the foremost exponents of the style such as Auber and Meyerbeer somehow fall a bit short when compared to their Italian competition.

So unfortunately this is an uneven production.  Still, as seen in it's BluRay version the picture quality is outstanding as is the quality of the sound. The aforementioned Naxos is available in both audio and video versions.  While I have not seen the video release, clips of the performance don't make me want to view it.  It is unfortunate that the current release is not available in an audio only version.",1434240000,10,6254,4.7856477166822

8702773,5,B00TQE9SHC,"I felt that the modern production worked well.  The opera is just over four hours long, and many of the creative touches added by the director increased the drama, kept things moving.  The whole thing takes place in the 1920's, and the Austrians are dressed in beautiful period outfits.  They smoke, drink and make fun of the poor Swiss, who are in working class clothes.  The Swiss have a great connection to the land, in fact they often are holding handfuls of dirt, delighting in this connection.  Of course things are stylized, there are stuffed horses on stage, but as the director says in the making of, it would be silly to try to put the Swiss alps on an opera stage.  I've seen many modern productions that have no connection to the music, but this one fit the music perfectly, and was well thought out and designed.  I also found the dances to be fascinating and original, and they garnered much applause from the audience.

Other reviewers have praised the singing, and I completely agree, Juan Diego Flrez, Marina Rebeka and Luca Tittoto (as Gesler) are wonderful, their singing is clear and rich, with ample dramatic involvement.  I agree with another reviewer who said it was a pity that the leads also used body mikes.  The downside to this is that they overpower the orchestra and chorus, and the ensemble sound is a bit unnatural, along one does get used to it.  The upside is that you can clearly hear every word of the duets, trios, etc., which is rarely the case.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed the blu-ray.  I recently saw this opera at the Met, and I liked their new production a bit more than this one, but I still found this production satisfying, for reasons pointed out above.
