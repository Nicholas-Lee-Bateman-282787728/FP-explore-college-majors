7787258,4,B01HHGAKEU,"My review of Set 17 has 1 star.
I have been a Midsomer fan for so long that I could not resist at least giving it one last chance and am happy to say, I liked it.
Neil Dudgeon has won me over.  The entire Set 18 does have more complex and modern stories but what is remarkable to me is that Dudgeon's performance no longer includes the sarcastic tics that made me unable to like or respect him as a character. Certainly John Nettles made some odd choices, in my opinion, that I found silly.  His preposterous, at times, accent and or manner of speaking, was ridiculous but there was always something terribly likable about him and I forgave the theatrical speech pattern.
Now there's a new boss in town with more authority due to a mature behavior.  No one likes the top guy to be mocking us and speaking down to us.
Most importantly, I became involved in the story rather than the superficial mannerisms.  I like this Barnaby.  I found it nice to see the bits of home life, too.
Congratulations to Mr. Dudgeon for giving us a more subtle performance and with it, gaining the respect we need to have to go along on the journey.",1468540800,41,1127,4.347619047619047
7787259,5,B01HHGAKEU,"I have been with this series all the way through and have loved it in every incarnation. Although our detective and forensic people have changed over the years, the series is built on great writing and the development of great eccentric UK characters set in English villages. They are a surprisingly bloodthirsty bunch of folks. The mysteries this time out satisfy as they always do. They always involve a scenario set in one of the surrounding villages. For example, one episode is set entirely in the world of bike racing. The victims are murderer are all there for that purpose. Their motive has something to do with the race.

Equally as enjoyable is a case involving a UFO sighting with villagers coming to believe they may be surrounded by aliens after all. There is especially one central crackpot who has been living off UFO stories for decades, making it the essence of his life.

Barnaby has become a father but his dog remains the highlight to viewers of his home life. The dog does Yoga, escapes from the vet's and every other imaginable dog feat. He too is a great character.

Very enjoyable, first rate BBC Mystery viewing.",1468540800,54,1137,4.732323232323233

7787302,5,B01HHGAKEU,"Midsomer Murders is going on 19 years, and Acorn TV has provided this new 19 th series. There are four episodes, and episode one will keep your attention, the episode named, The Village that Rose From The Dead, episode two is Crime and Punishment, Episode three is Last Man Out, episode four is Red in Tooth and Claw.

This series has everything you might want, murders, competition and a new DS. DCI Barnaby, played by Neil Dudgeon has another DS try out. DS Jamie Winter, played by Nick Hendrix, a young man bent on doing a good job. Baraby is a man who makes life a little difficult until the DS can prove himself. In the first episode, they are called to the sites of a murder, a young man has been partially run over by a tank. Yes, a tank. The little town of Auburn, has an old site that contained the miIitary during WWII. The pathologist, Kam, played by Manjinder Virk, a young woman with good experience, is called and she gives her thoughts. She also has a history with the new DS Hendrix.

From here on in, more murders, more characters, and more mayhem occur. The scripts follow the usual episodic trail, murder, detective work, and the culprit is found. Little green communities in the English countryside are featured. Midsomer continues to entertain.

7787373,3,B01HHGAKEU,"I am saddened by the fact that this series is now a relatively pale reflection of what it once was.  I continue to purchase the new installments for two reasons: I want a complete set and even in its present incarnation it is superior to most of the material that appears on American television.

Nevertheless, the quality of the series has seriously deteriorated.  The plots are wildly implausible.  In this series we have grave robbings and UFO sightings.  The murderer is, characteristically, the lead guest star for that episode.  There are also deus ex machina solutions.  We find, to give a fictional example, that Colonel Mustard was actually a plumber before he began his military career.  Hence, his familiarity with lead pipes.  This hiding of crucial information until the storys conclusion violates the first rule of mystery writingshow the audience the same evidence that the detective possesses.

The sets are still lovely and the English countryside is a joy.  Some money was invested in this series, in, e.g., A Dying Art, which features a murder in an elaborate sculpture garden.  Unfortunately, the acting (or the script writing) remains wooden.  There is little chemistry between Dudgeon and Lee; for that matter there is very little chemistry between Dudgeon and the actress who plays his wife.  Their dog Sykes remains the most interesting individual in the household.  Either Dudgeon is a wooden actor or he is being directed to be a wooden actor.  He does not exude any individual warmth or even much personality.  There is more (mandated) diversity in Midsomer these days, but it often seems forced and inessential to the stories.  It also violates the dictates of realism; the insularity and little England aspects of country life were among the shows hallmarks.  Indeed, they are one of the hallmarks of English mysteriesbubble worlds that function like locked rooms in another subgenre.

The first rule of fiction writing, in my humble opinion, is that one care about the characters.  Consider Robbie Lewis contemplating the death of Morse.  Consider Lewis interchanges with James Hathaway.  Consider the interactions of Brian Lane and Gerry Standing or of Dalziel and Pascoe.  The list is a very long one.  There is tension there, and humor, and love.  Here . . . the characters seem to be going through the motions, with little energy, little passion and little affection for one another or for their audience.",1477353600,9,2439,5.050125313283208

There is the core cast, the detectives and the medical examiners who have changed personnel over time, but the writers always deliver that ""family"" feeling.  These people who work together care about what they do and they care about each other.  Add a baby, and a dog, and the family core is set.  Into their lives come a host of weird, troubled, dangerous individuals, who are all suspects for some mostly grisly and usually strange murder.  You may have your suspect chosen as the killer, only to find that the twists of the story reveal someone else.  It is not obvious and the viewer follows the clues with the detectives.  In this series we have a disappearing corpse, a UFO hotspot, cyclist champions, a weird sculpture park, and a Harvest Fayre.  No Spoilers, you get the fun of watching and seeing if you can solve the case before Barnaby and Nelson.",1475193600,,961,4.6117647058823525
7787400,3,B01HHGAKEU,"With this long-running series' (since 1997) 105 - 111th episodes, it's happened, and it had to happen sometime--malaise has set in to Midsomer.

The series has never really recovered from the departure of John Nettles (in 2011), but even before that, in Nettles' final couple of seasons, a changing of the guard in the writers' room and producers' suite brought about a decided change in the signature tone of this series.  MM has carved out its unique niche in an overcrowded genre on the basis of a few signature factors:  1.  the lush, verdant and seemingly endless confines of the fictional Midsomer County, the blood-soaked murder capital of the world, consisting of hundreds of picturesque, homicidal hamlets with off-kilter names, and with its own unique seasonal calendar, weather and sense of geography.  Series creator Anthony Horowitz was correct in identifying Midsomer as the true star of this show.  2.  the prolific rate of murders, so many of which carried out by insanely creative, byzantine methods.  Only in Midsomer are wine bottles, rounds of cheese and even a bowl of eggs and live eels used as instruments of homicide.  And UFOs.  3.  the bantering, by turns witty, sarcastic and master/disciple relationship between DCI Barnaby and his sergeant.  John Nettles as Barnaby had three sergeants and each man in his turn brought droll moments to the sidekick role.  The scripts used to purposely put in opportunities for Barnaby to faux-abuse his sergeant and plenty of physical comedy business or snappy comebacks, as embodied by Mssrs. Daniel Casey, John Hopkins & Jason Hughes.

The first two are still in place, but the third, more indefinable and for me, more missed one, is definitely missing and has been since Day One of Neil Dudgeon's tenure as Barnaby.  Dudgeon is a master comic actor who could deliver this if asked to, but the scripts do not really allow for it anymore.  As a result, the 'new' Midsomer is a pale imitation of its former self.  Still an inventive crime procedural, but the deft blend of homicide investigaton with lighter elements is now a whole lot heavier in feel.  Even in the midst of grim murder, there used to be an overall effervescent feeling to the proceedings.  Midsomer was a magical sort of place, where the grisly murders seemed to have no lasting effect on the mood or the population.  The current production has been dragged closer to the real world via its more ponderous tone and rigorously color-blind casting aesthetic.

John Barnaby is so dull as a character in his own right, they have to goose him up with an insanely cute dog AND an insanely cute baby.  Both Sykes and Betty (a little Mini-Me version of Neil Dudgeon) perform their tasks admirably . . .but the scripts are getting more bland and interchangeable as they go.  The set preceding this one had 3 out of 4 quite excellent plots.  This one consists of 6 mysteries--two more than normal--and I was completely bored by them all.  The zing is gone.  On the upside, the show has never *looked* better--the cottages are more charming, the stately homes more stately, the grass greener and the flowers brighter.  In this regard they have improved upon the past . . but the trade-off has been pretty steep--increasingly prosaic storytelling, forgettable plots and the primary relationship between our two lead coppers flattened to nothing.  The finished product *looks* as good as ever--better--but like a glass of champagne that's lost its fizz, first appearances are deceiving.  Sadly.

P.S. to add that it has been announced that Gwilim Lee as DS Charlie Nelson is departing Midsomer after just 3 seasons, the shortest sergeant run since John Hopkins (who still had two more episodes in his 2-year run since a season used to consist of 8 mysteries each.)  Even the second-billed star of the show is finding himself bored.",1475193600,6,3849,4.911764705882353

7787405,4,B01HHGAKEU,"Another good series.  I am still adjusting even after several years to the 'new/different' Inspector Barnaby, but the actors who play the Detective Sergeants: Troy, Jones, Nelson, are always well suited/well cast to their role.  Since the new producer took over along with Neil Dudgeon, the series has lost a lot, a lot, of the original small-village feel and English quirkiness/eccentricities which made the original Barnaby series' so very good and amusing, now more often than not it is just another whodunit in a beautiful English country setting. My opinion is that this series is worth waiting for to purchase via Amazon rather than pay Acorn Productions high price to get the DVD a couple of months ahead of widespread availability.  If this series still starred John Nettles and had the original producer, I would pay the higher price.",1474934400,,843,5.0503597122302155
7787406,5,B01HHGAKEU,"I thoroughly enjoy Midsomer Murders, and Series 18 is no exception. The goal, as the producers have stated before, is to have murders just a little off-kilter. They usually manage to do this, and the eerie theme music always helps.

Causton CID has a new pathologist, Dr. Kam Karimore. She's smart and feisty, and a running gag throughout this series is her competition with Charlie Nelson in  everything! Even who would be better at dog-sitting Sykes.

A second running gag is the little competition between John Barnaby and his wife Sarah. Each parent tries to coach their baby, Betty, on her very first word. Will it be ""DaDa"" or ""MaMa""? This was a hit with me, because it reminded me of our same attempts with our daughter.

Series 18 of ""Midsomer Murders"" has the 105th through the 110th episodes of this long-running mystery show. They originally aired January/February 2016. The six mysteries total 557 minutes without commercials. The BluRay/DVD sets include 35 minutes of Bonus Features. Both the episodes and the six Bonuses have English subtitles available.

....Episoode 1. ""Habeas Corpus"" Gregory Lancaster, 75, has just died from pneumonia at his home, upstairs. The undertaker, Caleb Southwood, goes upstairs with his assistant. After a look in the master bedroom, Caleb goes to the head of the stairs and calls down, ""Mrs. Lancaster, a word please... Where's the body?"" Now this is Midsomer weirdness! Though the motivations are a little far-fetched.
....Bonus A.  ""Behind the Scenes of Habeas Corpus"" (4 minutes) Commentators include Ray De-Haan (stunt co-ordinator), Helen Baxendale (plays Rose), Alastair MacKenzie (plays Felix) and Ciaran McMenamin (plays Craig). The consensus is that the stunt performers aren't just good at derring-do. They're also good at making the non-stunt actors comfortable.
....Episode 2.  ""The Incident at Cooper Hill"" Felicity Ford, forest ranger, is driving at night when a brilliant white light forces her to stop in the middle of the road, just at the crossroads to head up to Cooper Hill. All they find the next morning is her car, still running with its doors open, and one of her boots.
It's UFOs in Midsomer!
....Bonus B.  ""Behind the Scenes of The Incident at Cooper Hill"" (5 minutes) Commentators include Phil Hunter (producer), Steve Evets (plays Carter), Steve Oram (plays Nathan) and Alison Steadman (plays Abigail). Hunter explain that they had to make a choice whether the UFO would be a scale model or life-size: ""In the end, we drove a 90-meter crane into Black Park... and we flew our life-size UFO through the skies of Buckinghamshire."" AFTER warning the locals.
....Episode 3.  ""Breaking the Chain"" It's the last minutes of the 2nd leg of the 5th annual Midsomer Cycling Grand Prix. Greg Eddon, ""young rebel rider"", wins for Team DJM, even though he had orders not to. He heads to the tent for his cool-down on a stationary bike. And doesn't notice when someone sneaks in to literally throw a wrench in the works.
....Bonus C.  ""Behind the Scenes of Breaking the Chain"" (4 minutes) Commentators include Neil Dudgeon (plays DCI Barnaby), Manjinder Virk (plays Kam Karimore), Gwilym Lee (plays DS Charlie Nelson), Tessa Peak Jones (plays Mary) and Joe Megann (plays Jez). Dudgeon: ""We start shooting a new episode every five weeks. So, we have a week of preparation and four weeks of filming.""
....Episode 4. ""A Dying Art"" Brandon Monkford is hosting a Grand Opening party. In spite of the controversy about fencing off paths which some think should be public right-of-way, he has opened his dream  a modern Sculpture Park. After his speech, the guests take off with flashlights in the warm summer night to find the sculptures throughout the grounds. Clementine Staples finds the piece de resistance, a sculpture fountain with a waterfall of golden liquid. Unfortunately, Brandon Monkford is leaning upon it, quite dead, with the liquid gold flowing over his head.
....Bonus D.  ""Behind the Scenes of A Dying Art"" (5 minutes) Commentators include Neil Dudgeon, Ramon Tikaram (plays Lance Auden), Matt Carter (director), Paul Booth (production designer), Richard Field (art director), Gwilym Lee and Cherie Lunghi (plays Alexandra Monkford).
....Episode 5.  ""Saints and Sinners"" In a field outside of town, an archeological team led by Zoe Dyer has just discovered a long-buried body. Zoe exclaims, ""The hallux is missing. It's her! It's Cicely!"" Unfortunately for someone, the bones of Cicely Milson, Protestant martyr, already lie in state in the crypt of the local church. Supposedly. I counted at least 4 murders in this episode, including death by headstone.
P.S. The ""hallux"" is the big toe.
....Episode 6.  ""Harvest of Souls"" Harry Wyham plans to turn a big portion of his land into a world-class equestrian center. Even if it means not renewing tenant leases and refusing to host the village's annual Harvest Fair. That includes leaving no room for the traveling carnival at the fair, too. Plenty of bad feelings all around.
....Bonus E.  ""The Dogs and Babies of Midsomer"" (4 minutes) Neil Dudgeon describes the joys of filming with babies. The right effect can be a long time coming, but when it does, it's marvelous. And then there's Sykes, ""He does everything just for the sausages, purely mercenary.""
....Bonus F.  ""An Introduction to Dr. Kim Karimore"" (3 minutes) Commentators include Neil Dudgeon, Manjinder Virk and Gwilym Lee.

Are you keeping track of Midsomer Murders' village names? In this series we get Little Malton, Burwood Mantle, Angel's Rise, Midsomer Cicely and Whitcombe Mallet.

DS Charlie Nelson is leaving the show after this Series 18. Actor Gwilym Lee wants to pursue other opportunities. His replacement for Series 19 is DS Jamie Winter, played by Nick Hendrix. It's been reported that he'll get to investigate murder at a Rabbit & Guinea Pig Show.

7787407,5,B01HHGAKEU,"Pre-ordered this Midsomer Murder- and received it two-days ago. My husband and I,are addicts. We have every Midsomer Murder Set/Series with John Nettles, whose portrayal of Tom Barnaby, was superb and set a precedent for what one expected a CID in England would be-along with his DSs-Gavin Troy;Ben Jones and Dan Scott. The casting of these characters was excellent along with incredible story lines that set these mysteries in a category of it's own.
Neil Dudgeon is okay; however, still can't get used to John Barnaby's style of detective work-an ""In-your-face,clipped attitude, along with a scraggly-looking DS-Charlie, that resembles a throw-back to the Woodstock era.
Clean-cut, tie and suited Tom Barnaby and associates was in keeping with the entire Midsomer,Causton CID,persona for over 20-odd years and the change is stark. I recall, In one episode, Tom told Jones to put on his tie-they were were investigating,speaking to suspects.
Series 18, also has a new Medical Examiner- Kam, who's a bit of an affected, intellectual, female, that makes Charlie- a bit uncomfortable at times. We miss the Dr. George Bullard-character-the ME with Nettles' Tom Barnaby. The writers gave George an innate forensic,intelligence along with light bantering with Tom.
Series 18 contains 6 new Midsomer Episodes:
* Habeas Corpus
* The Incident at Cooper's Hill
* Breaking the Chain
* A Dying Art
* Saints and Sinners
* Harvest of Souls
We have only viewed the first two, since it will be awhile until another set is released, so we are savoring these new Midsomer stories and re watching, as always,Tom and his three-detective musketeers,who, when Tom asks for their opinions on the crime and suspects, sometimes jump to wild, conclusions-expected,with the DS, learning curve.
It's the intriguing story-lines that will make us continue to purchase Midsomer Murders and eventually,I assume,we'll get use to the new Barnaby and scruffy, Charlie.
The first story, Habeas Corpus was excellent. The second episode, The Incident at Cooper's Hill,about alleged UFO sightings was not really up to the Midsomer story-lines, in our opinion. The sub-plots that one gets used to and appreciates with Midsomer Murders was not as smoothly integrated as normal.
All in all, if you are a Midsomer Murder addict, it's a MUST. One falls in love not only with the writing but the ambiance of the Midsomer County's small shops,winding roads, extensive fields and trees,thatched roofs;English country gardens and horses trotting down country lanes.

7787415,5,B01HHGAKEU,"Midsomer Murders, Series 18. The cozy English village mystery gets a clever updating  in this perennially popular British television series that has earned a worldwide following. As made by ITV, the British mystery stars Neil Dudgeon as the capable Detective Chief Inspector John Barnaby; it contains all six standalone thrillers from the eighteenth series of Midsomer. The police procedural, set in the idyllic, picturesque --fictional --county of Midsomer that seems to have a record-breaking number of murders annually shows us that sometimes all is not as it seems. Beneath the tranquil surface of  life in its charming villages, its well-cropped lawns, shrubs and women,  is a disturbing  likelihood to resort to murder. Particularly among the womenfolk.

We get bucolic settings that are home to macabre crimes, sometimes startlingly original; eccentric characters that are no match for DCI Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon, Life of Riley) and his assistant, DS Charlie Nelson (Gwilym Lee, Land Girls) in his final episodes as Barnabys partner.  The scripts are tight, entertaining, written by some of the best screenwriters in the business.  They are well-acted and filmed, always with a light touch. Leonard Maltins Movie Crazy  raved Delightful in a murderously charming way. Guest stars include Diana Quick, Helen Baxendale, Julia Sawalha, Pip Torrens, Cherie Lunghi, and Malcolm Sinclair: lots of good parts for women in this entertainment.  The episodes are:

1. Habeas Corpus. Corpse of an elderly man disappears from his deathbed; cops hunt for  serial body-snatcher.

2. The Incident at Cooper Hill. Death of a female forest ranger in a UFO-sighting hot spot leads some locals to wishfully believe that she was killed by aliens.

3. Breaking the Chain. Champion cyclist is murdered minutes after winning a race; suspicion falls on rivals, teammates.

4. A Dying Art. Wealthy eccentric dies on opening night of his outdoor sculpture park; his body inserted into one of the artworks.

5. Saints and Sinners. Hours after she makes an important find, archaeologist found buried alive at her dig.

6. Harvest of Souls. Cops investigate death of man trampled by horse near the Whitcombe Mallet Harvest Fayre.
The box set, which I received in expectation of an honest, unbiased review, consists of three discs, approximately 557 minutes, containing the six stories. There are six bonus extras. There are subtitles, thankfully, for those of us not up on rural English accents. No sex, brutality, blood, disturbing scenes or bad language, thankfully, for those of us interested in family viewing.  This show, unusually enough, keeps getting stronger through the years.  If it stays this good, may it run forever.",1474243200,,2707,5.29976580796253

7787417,5,B01HHGAKEU,"Always multiple murder. Gorgeous architecture and gardens. Another key to the huge success of Midsomer Murders is high level writing and acting. Other contemporary Brit cop series seldom match Midsomers excellence, Midsomer set the mark years ago. Others use shock scenes, violence, or unnatural action. If you like suspense and intrigue with depth, similar to Agatha Christie, then Midsomer Murder continues to deliver. After 4 seasons of 4 episodes each, this season has 6 as a result of increasing world-wide Midsomer popularity. Midsomer Murder started in 1997, now having 110 episodes, a lot of murdered corpses. Series 19 (2017) will also have 6 eps.
Neil Dudgeon has achieved stardom as Barnaby (since 2010), Gwilym Lee (Land Girls) ends his run as DS Nelson begun in 2013, Fiona Dolman continues as wife/mom Sarah Baranaby started in 2011, and newcomer & good fit Manjinder Virk plays the new forensics Dr Kam Karimore, & she's returning for next season.
