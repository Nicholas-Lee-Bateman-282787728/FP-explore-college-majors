2163590,5,B00062WUQY,"I first saw this show on Nick at night about a million years ago. It was cool then and it's still cool now. The show is about a normal family moving to a very creepy town and the main character, Marshall, is the only one that thinks that talking atm's and perserving your children in containers is freaky. The show never got dull and is still one of my favorites. If you remember Are You Afraid of the Dark then you'll love this series. I already ordered my copy of this- last time this series was released it was pulled from the shelves and was selling on ebay for over $200!!

There were lots of famous faces in the series like- Tobey Maguire, Danielle Harris, Nicki Cox, and more.

Here is a list of the episodes

This series was so uniquely humorous and reverential of 50's-60's horror and sci-fi that it shocked me that it wasn't renewed back then. I was a kid and since it was only broadcasted once (I never knew about the resurgence on Saturday mornings for a different generation) I missed quite a few of these episodes. Had I known it was released on DVD years ago I would have bought several copies. Instead, I bought them several years too late.

As a bookend 80's- 90's tv show, the thematic nature of some of these episodes might not be ""appropriate"" for newly wussified generations. Just like ""Punky Brewster"" and ""Different Strokes"" dealt with topically dark issues, this series touches upon death a bit. Sometimes with humor, but several times realistically. Those are gripping, gut wrenchers for kids I suppose, but they were still relevant. Grow some empathy kids!

Anyways, I'll always have a love for this series. Some episodes stood out so much I'd remembered them from their initial broadcast. The Woman who stores herself and her children in vacuum sealed plastic tubs to prevent them from aging gives a perfect example of metaphor and absurdity vis a vis humor that made this an exceptional series for young adventurous minds.

The transfers are not the best, but it's to be expected from the TV series, I suppose. I don't work in the field so I have no pertinent info regarding the originals and transfers. Yet, for the price it's worth it.

Hell, you can also relive your childhood fantasies of the extraordinary Julia Condra (the wonder years, Crying Freeman, then who ultimately disappeared from media).

2163599,5,B00062WUQY,"This series brings back the spook factor of childhood all over again.
I remember biting the remote control when i was really young because i wanted to see if I could get transferred into the TV.
It's no where near as scary as it was when I was younger, but it definitely brings back those good haunt memories, and the adrenaline of feeling young again. :)

This show was like a tales from the crypt, or creep show for a younger audience.

It's outdated, and isn't anything close to the horror genres we have of today.
If you can go into it with that mindset you won't be disappointed.

B rated horror buffs would love this series due to it's poor acting, but mediocre story lines!

Excellent Series!
I'm so glad that i found this show available in DVD format.
It's a hard find so get it while you can.

Thanks,

I bought this series quite a few years ago & Ive watched it a few times since; each viewing is a fun trip down memory lane. There were a couple of episodes that stuck with me for years, such as, Foreverware & The Retainer. Its too bad the show didn't do well enough & stay on TV longer.

2163624,5,B00062WUQY,"I loved Eerie Indiana as a kid, and was thrilled to see it out on DVD. I ordered this originally for myself to reminisce and enjoy a series from my childhood. However, I decided ""Why not share this with some kids in 2010?"" I teach 5th grade, and have shown several episodes of Eerie Indiana to my students. They LOVE IT!! They constantly ask when we'll watch it again. This show is great for helping kids understand theme, plot, characters, and so many other things. Also, it's fun to watch and scary too. This show has a great sense of humor. It's like an X-Files for Kids! I highly recommend this for parents to watch with their kids- too much violence in today's shows and movies. ""Foreverware"", ""Who's Who?"" and ""The Retainer"" are my favorites. Don't miss out, order this DVD while you still can!",1305331200,2,800,4.524137931034483

I am more than happy with my purchase and I know this episodes can bring good memories to the kids that watched this some years ago. Nice menues, the DVDs come in separate boxes, very nice presentation. I give 5 stars because of the show and the item itself is very good quality.",1293667200,,655,4.421487603305785

2163627,5,B00062WUQY,"Eerie, Indiana is one of those glorious types of shows for the whole family that they just don't make anymore. It's also one of those cult-like shows that many people missed when it was originally on. I have to admit that I am one of those people. I saw one episode. With a weird time slot and not too much promotion from what I can remember, it was just something that bypassed me and I never gave it much thought. Like a lot of people. I recently came across it online a while ago, and I knew that this was a show that would be right up my alley. After ordering my set, I am glad I did. Eerie, Indiana is a show that lives up to it's cult status and the reviews from it's fan base who clearly love this show. It's easy to see why.

""Eerie, Indiana"" was an NBC show that aired during the 1991-1992 season. The show was about teenager Marshall Teller(Omri Katz), who moved to the quaint little town with his parents and older sister from New Jersey. His only friend is a 9 year old named Simon. Marshall quickly learns that Eerie is not a normal town. Underneath the Leave It To Beaver/Norman Rockwell exterior is a town filled with odd, eccentric people, mysterious places, unexplained phenomena, and so on. No one else sees it. The only one who believes Marshall is Simon. It's up to the two of them to stand Eerie's weirdness, and maybe get the story out to everyone else.

Director Joe Dante(""Gremlins"", ""The Burbs"", ""The Howling"") is a cretive consultant on the show and a frequent director. It shows. Dante's quirky sense of humor is all over the place, as is his use of familiar faces(Dick Miller, Henry Gibson). At first, the show may seem to be targeted directly at the younger crowd, who are part of it's audience, but don't let that fool you. It's great for younger kids, but it's really smart, clever, creative, and mature enough for everyone of all ages. There is something here for everyone to enjoy. Plenty of jokes and sight gags for the adults tht might go over the heads of a younger audience. Plus, if you grew up on Dante's films or the creative quirkiness of kid's shows past, this delivers. Like I said earlier, it's a show they just don't make anymore. Dante and the rest of the directors have a sharp eye, and keep every episode fun and interesting looking, but the scripts are just as strong and fun. You'll instantly like young Marshall and feel like your with him on every adventure. The cast is a lot of fun too. Some performances are heightened to accomodate the bizarre, oddball, fantasy nature of the show, but it's all in good fun. Mid-way thru the series, John Astin(""The Addams Family"")joins the cast, as does James Marsters as the mysterious Dash X. You'll also see some familiar faces here and there Ray Walston, Matt Frewer, Danielle Harris, and even a young Tobey Maguire.

So, what are you getting by way of episodes?. The series starts off with ""Forever Ware"", probably the most well known episode. Mrs. Teller comes across a neighbor lady selling tupperware. Tupperware that keeps things, and people, extra fresh!. One of my favorites is ""Heart On A Chain"", a beautiful episode. It's a tragic, gothic-like love story for the teen set. It's a wonderful episode. Elsewhere, there is ""The Retainer"", where a local resident's retainer begins picking up signals; ""ATM With A Heart Of Gold"" is an episode that has a town ATM that every town wishes they had; ""The Losers"" has Henry Gibson overlooking a mysterious place where every lost or misplace thing in Eerie ends up; ""Scariest Home Videos"" is a fun Halloween episode that finds the boys accidentally releasing a mummy from a movie; ""Just Say No Fun"" finds the adults at school wanting to suck the fun out of the students; Tobey Maguire appears as a ghost who want a long lost letter delivered in ""The Dead Letter""; Marshall finds himself in an alternate Eerie when he refuses to set back his clocks in ""The Lost Hour""; A scary tornado in ""Tornado Days""; ""Mr. Chaney"" finds Marshall becoming the Harvest King, and having to face off with a local werewolf legend; ""Reality Takes A Holiday"" is a clever episode with Marshall finding himself on the set of 'Eerie Indiana' and everyone playing themselves. There's more episodes here, but no need to go over every one. Just get the set and discover the fun for youself.

""Eerie, Indiana"" is a pleasure. It was a joy to watch. I wished I had paid more attention when it was on. Combined with a poor time slot and the network just not knowing what to do with such a show, the series only lasted 1 season and 19 episodes. The 19th of which never aired, but is here on the set. There is a lot of genuine fun and cleverness at work here, and it's all in this delightful and wonderful set for the kid in everyone.",1272672000,2,4741,4.522144522144522

2163629,5,B00062WUQY,The possibility of having the series on DVD has let me focus on details I couldn't even remember.

2163632,5,B00062WUQY,"My memories of Eerie, Indiana from its premiere back in the 80's were of a witty, absorbing, and innovative program that, while aimed at tweens, was universal enough to engage adults too.  Re-watching the DVD set convinced me that my memories were not false and that the show was cancelled way too soon.  Follow the adventures of Marshall, newcomer to a ""typical american town"" where Bigfoot rummages through the garbage and extraterrestrials land in the woods.  And that's just for starters.

2163634,5,B00062WUQY,"My whole family loved this short lived series. We are enjoying seeing it again. The premise is based upon a boy, Marshall, whose family moves to a new town, Eerie, Indiana. The emphasis is on ""eerie"", not ""scary"". Marshall and his friend investigate the odd happenings around town. Among other revelations, you'll find out how a set of identical twins are able to look exactly the same as they did in a 30-year old yearbook.",1229126400,3,424,4.666666666666667
2163635,5,B00062WUQY,"Marshall Teller is a 13-year-old with a fascination for the strange and unusual. At least, ever since he moved to Eerie, Indiana, which he believes is the center of weirdness for the entire planet. Elvis lives on his paper route, Bigfoot eats out of his garbage, and his sister is a goddess. Well, actually, that bit about his sister is just my opinion. Along with his best-friend and partner, 10-year-old Simon, Marshall keeps track of everything strange that goes on in the seemingly quaint little town, and more often than not finds himself in the heart of the weirdness with nothing but his wits and his sidekick to get him out.

""Eerie Indiana"" aired on NBC from '91 to '92. I was in high school at the time, one year older than the show's lead, Omri Katz (probably most recognized as the star of Disney's Halloween film ""Hocus Pocus""), and I was an instant fan, though I can't for the life of me recall the time slot the show was in. Sort of a junior version of ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" and a predecessor to Night Stalker-inspired ""The X-Files"", Eerie was noteworthy as a highly imaginative show for the whole family that wasn't dumbed-down. The writing was smart and fun, and the acting was excellent! The show boasted some fine guest-stars and great continuity. Omri Katz was a fabulous actor (a shame he didn't do much other stuff), as was everyone on the show. And, yeah, I was and am still totally in love with Julie Condra, who played Marshall's big sister Syndi. The final six episodes of the all too short-lived series involved a retooling that replaced ""World O' Stuff"" proprietor Archie Hahn with the original Addams Family's John Astin in a cleverly written twist and introduced the new character of Dash X, a weird, gray-haired, self-interested kid with no home or knowledge of his past, played by a longtime fave of mine who gets much more cartoon voice work than live-action work, Jason Marsden.

This DVD set is a fine collection for loyal fans of the show or anyone interested in the weird and unusual. Definitely a ""must have"", though the picture and sound quality aren't really what one hopes for from DVD by any means, and there are no DVD extras. All 19 episodes are included here, including one that wasn't aired in the original run, which is probably the reason it appears as the final episode in the set, despite being set before the Dash X episodes. Here is my breakdown of the episodes.

Disc One

Forever Ware: Marshall and Simon try to help the oddball twin sons of a woman who is inducting Mrs. Teller into her cult of Forever Ware sellers, but Forever Ware holds a very strange secret.

The Retainer: In his nervousness about a trip to the dentist for a retainer, Marshall relays to us the tale of a kid he and Simon new who had a tragic experience as a result of his own retainer, a bizarre invention of the local dentist with the unexpected ability to translate the voices of dogs.

Scariest Home Videos: It's Halloween, and things are as weird as ever when Marshall and Simon have to deal with a mummy from an old movie that has switched places with Simon's little brother, now trapped in the television.

Just Say No Fun: Eerie is losing its since of humor thanks to a school nurse reprogramming everyone with a fun-removing eye-test and matching glasses.

Heart on a Chain: Marshall's crush on a cute girl with a heart problem leads to trouble when she gets a transplant from their mutual friend.

Disc Three

Who's Who: Marshall and Simon meet a distressed girl at the World O' Stuff whose family is simply unbearable. When Marshall sees the girl has a talent for drawing, he buys her an Eerie-made pencil that unleashes some amazing abilities.

The Lost Hour: Setting his watch back an hour, even though Indiana doesn't do the Daylight Savings thing, throws things off bigtime for Marshall, landing him an hour behind everyone else in an Eerie nearly devoid of life. Nearly.

Disc Four

Tornado Days: During a bizarre town festival, Marshall stays home and has a strange encounter with a tornado rider determined to join up with Eerie's own annual whirlwind. The great Matt Frewer guest stars!

The Hole in the Head Gang: While investigating a haunted house, one of many in Eerie, the guys discover a strange, homeless, gray-haired kid around Marshall's age with markings on his hand and no name or memory of how he got to Eerie or anything before that. In addition, they discover the ghost of the worst bank robber ever, Grungy Bill.

Mr. Chaney: It's time for the town to pick a Harvest King, and most everyone is excited about it, but Marshall and the gray-haired kid know something is weird about the whole thing. The Harvest King has a great day, but at the end he must go out into the woods till he sees the Eerie Wolf, and it does seem strange that there are no ex-Harvest Kings.

Disc Five

The Loyal Order of Corn: Marshall and Simon are investigating the local lodge that Marshall's father has joined. They have a reputation for being more than just a group of men having a good time, and the gray-haired kid, who now calls himself Dash X, is already working there, so something sinister must be up!

Zombies in P.J.s: When Mr. Radford is concerned about a visit from the I.R.S., a visitor comes into town to help him increase sales 100 percent, but at what cost? No one seems to get anything from him without signing one of his many contracts.

Reality Takes a Holiday: Marshall is thrown for a loop when his reality suddenly changes on him. After finding a script to everything he and his family just said, he finds himself in a world where Eerie Indiana is just a TV show, he and his family are just a bunch of actors, and Dash X is scheming to have him killed off and take over the show! Yep, this is the real final episode.

The Broken Record: In an episode that didn't air till syndication, possibly because of the more serious subject matter, Marshall introduces a new friend to his favorite heavy metal band, the Pitbull Surfers, but he doesn't anticipate how deeply obsessed with the band the boy will become. A victim of verbal abuse from his father, the music soon becomes an outlet for the boys frustrations, and that's not all. This one was supposed to come between ""Tornado Days"" and ""The Hole in the Head Gang"".

""Eerie Indiana"" is definitely one of my all-time faves, and it was a hoot watching it all over again in this DVD set. If you are a fan of shows like ""Kolchak the Night Stalker"", ""The X-Files"", ""Twilight Zone"", ""So Weird"", ""Goosebumps"", ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"", ""Smallville"", ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show"" or anything of that nature, you're sure to love this! I also recommend fans of the film ""Hocus Pocus"", the greatest Halloween movie ever made, give ""Eerie Indiana"" a look. With the same lead actor riding around town on his bike trying to save it from weird dangers, it clearly has its similarities. There was actually a spin-off series of ""Eerie Indiana"" called ""Eerie Indiana: The Other Dimension"" on Fox in 1998 that followed a replay of the original show. Unfortunately, while I remember the advertisements, I never caught that show, which was apparently set in a parallel dimension in which the situations were very much the same but the cast of characters (played by different actors, of course) had different but similarly sounding names. That show's Marshall Teller was named Mitchell Taylor. Instead of Simon Holmes, his sidekick was a Stanley Hope, and Mitchell's big sister was named Carrie instead of Syndi. I hear it didn't have the same spirit of the original. Probably was dumbed-down for kids, though that's just my guess. Knowing that, my biggest disappointment in not seeing that 15 episode series is that another actress I have a big crush on, Lindy Booth, played the big-sis this time around.

Anyway, do yourself a favor and pick up the original show. It's currently at a pretty sweet price for a 5 disc set of such a great, complete series. You also get to enjoy the beauty of Julie Condra all over again, as I certainly have been enjoying over the past week or so. And, if you like it, there are some books out there that continue Marshall and Simon's adventures which came out back when the spin-off series did. I haven't checked them out, but they certainly look intriguing! Wish they'd start up a comic book series now too!",1221955200,8,9467,4.625744934445769

Well, that was quite a few years ago. Being somewhat of a classic television show nut, I decided to purchase the series so I could watch the entire offering. I must say, I have mixed feelings about the show in retrospect. Some of the episodes were top notch (""Forever Ware"", ""The Losers"", ""Scariest Home Videos"", ""The Lost Hour"", ""Just Say No Fun"", ""No Brain, No Pain"", ""Reality Takes a Holiday"") while others were somewhat disconcerting (""Broken Record"", ""Heart on a Chain"", ""The Dead Letter"", ""Who's Who"").

With some of the episodes, (the four previous mentioned especially) you weren't sure whether to laugh or feel sorry for what was happening to some of the characters. Some of the acting was very over done (the part of Simon in particular). Perhaps the most interesting thing about the show is to pay attention to what goes on in the background. Every once in a while you will see references to The Grim Reaper. Also, for some reason, a milk truck is a main focus from time-to-time.",1203292800,,1133,4.722222222222222

The DVD is just the bare minimum, but that is really enough. The episodes look just like they did when they aired on tv to my eyes.  The adventures are fun and would be slightly spooky to children.

2163645,5,B00062WUQY,"After reading one of the earlier reviews of this show I held off buying this dvd set.  It sounded like the episodes were burned into cardboard instead of the traditional disc. However, after much hesitation  my better sense prevailed and I took the chance.  I have found the quality to be very good and there is nothing wrong with the sound.  The trick here is to have an optical cable run from the output of your dvd player into your receiver that accepts Dolby Digital.  If this is done you'll have a fine-sounding 5 channel playback.  Without the optical cable you will not here the sound in Dolby Digital.  As far as the packaging, there is nothing at all wrong with it.  You get 5 discs with this set.  There are 4 episodes per disc except for disc 1 which has only 3 episodes on it.  There are your 19 episodes.  I have a 50"" large screen TV and as far as I'm concerned this BMG company did a very fine job with such a fine series.  It's just a shame the show didn't go over better when it was on network TV.  I highly recommend this and I'm certain you won't be at all disappointed.  I'm very pickie when it comes to picture quality and this is very nice quality!",1169424000,8,1170,4.235294117647059

2163647,5,B00062WUQY,"""To whom it may concern. If you're reading this document, it means I'm either dead - or disappeared under mysterious circumstances. My name is Marshall Teller."" Very much in X-Files territory for kiddies (plus a little of 'Malcolm in the middle' type sitcom), this was an entertaining and 'different' series in its day (1991 to 1992).

My son (10) likes to watch these episodes, although I have to sit with him as he knows they are a mildly spooky. A few of the jokes must go over his head, e.g. lines mentioning Elvis Presley and the Twin Peak's 'Log Lady', but he clearly identifies with the likeable young boy leads (Marshall is 15 and friend Simon is 11, although they look younger). This DVD set looks and sounds good on the small screen and the special effects haven't really dated (there aren't that many anyway) - they have high production values giving a similar feel to that of the 1960's classic ScFi series 'Lost in Space'. There aren't that many episodes on each DVD, so obviously the series didn't outstay its welcome. I assume the plug was pulled during season 2, as there was an episode 'The Jolly Roger' that was never filmed. This DVD set has the eighteen screened episodes, with titles such as 'Reality takes a holiday', 'Zombies in PJs', and 'Marshall's theory of believability', and also includes the extra 'unshown' nineteenth episode 'The unbroken record' - which wasn't screened in the US until late 1993, a year after the original series had finished. In 'Tornado days', obsessed 'Howard Raymer' was also 'Max Headroom' (one of my favourite TV characters from 1987). Plus it's great to see John Astin occasionally (Gomez from the classic 1960s Addams Family TV series) as Radford.

The storylines range from 'Forever-ware' plastic storage containers (a good skit on the 60's 'Tupperware' parties for those who remember them) to a particularly disturbing one on a child's metal dental-work bridge picking up the dark thoughts of dogs like an aerial. My son particularly liked the 'ATM with a heart of gold' (and this is just the first 3 episodes). Typical series quote : 'A haunted toaster, cool !"". Probably this series will only be bought by those who have seen it in their youth, but it still seems to be watchable for today's youngsters (particularly boys). So good value and highly recommended.

They investigate the ""weirdness"" and record it alll.  What is interesting, no one else seems to notice anything.  To the rest of the town-including Marshall's family, everything is normal.

It just sucked the series had to end so soon when it start developing into in my opinion if given more time. One of the most well written series out there.

2163653,4,B00062WUQY,"I remember when I was younger and watched the series with my parents (then around 6 or 7), we would watch the new episodes Sunday evenings at around 7pm and watch them again Saturday mornings.

This was my favorite show when I was growing up (probably because I love paranormal stories). This show managaes to take their stories and make them fun and entertaining in an original way, all while keeping it at least somewhat serious (unlike it's spin-off ""The Other Demension"" ). I only wish they could somehow have kept the cast young (perhaps in foreverware tupperware?) so that they could have kept the show going.

Some of the shows that tend to stand out in my mind are, Foreverware, Tornado Days, Scariest Home Videos, Reality Takes a Holiday, and Broken Record (which actually was run in the series it's second time through it replaced ""Heart on a Chain"" due to times changing I suppose). After only 19 episodes you begin to wish there were more floating around out there. The unfilmed Pirate episode sounded like it would have been a very interesting one as well... Then again the whole series was interesting and a perfect addition to anyones collection, even if you are an adult.

2163656,4,B00062WUQY,"At its best Eerie Indiana was flat out brilliant.  13 year old Marshall is a resent transplant form New Jersey.  Simon, his 9 year old best friend, is a life long Eerie resident.  Despite the four year age difference the two boys share a strong bond as they are the only ones who are aware that Eerie is not what it seems.  Eerie has one foot in middle America and the other foot in The Twilight Zone.  As such, for a few fabulous episodes, the show was able to pull off the near impossible.  It effectively parodied the supernatural and the mundane all at the same time.

But by the seventh episode, ""Heart on a Chain"" things started to go wrong.  The story about the little girl who received a heart transplant with the donor being a friend of Marshall wasn't very funny.  It played like a creepy and very depressing soap opera.  Fortunately the momentum was regained with the next five installments which contain some of the show's finest moments.

But in episode 13, ""The Hole in the Wall Gang""  the writers pushed the self destruct button.  We meet the ""Gray Haired Kid.""  The Gray Haired Kid is a good actor and he has many very funny lines but what is he doing in the story?  Until we met T.G.K.  Marshall and Simon were the only people who knew the Eerie was creepy.  The problem is, with no name and no memory of who he is, T.G.K. is himself creepy.  The writers don't know how to use his character just as Marshall and Simon don't know how to relate to him.  Is he a potential friend and ally or is he just one more example of Eerie weirdness to be studied?  The boys don't know and neither do we.

In episode 18 Marshall discovers that his house and Eerie have been replaced by a Hollywood sound stage and his friends and family are actors who in turn think he is an actor.  A good idea for a story but why oh why did they have to make every member of the cast out to be a money grubbing, self centered prick.  To add insult to injury the names used (and used, and used) by the cast are the real names of the actors.  We see Simon, holding a cell phone the size of a shoe box to his ear, as he berates his own mother for a botched stock deal.  Simon is an innocent and lovable kid and I'm sure the actor who played him has many fine qualities.  To depict him as a spoiled super brat was both cynical and mean spirited.  It certainly wasn't funny.

Perhaps someday someone will remake Eerie Indiana and concentrate on all the things that made most of the episodes so great.  The idea for the series deserves respect just as the characters of Marshall and Simon deserve to be treated with affection.",1131321600,6,2608,4.26530612244898
2163657,4,B00062WUQY,"This was another great show that envisioned the world through the eyes of a child, but in a much spookier way. As another reviewer put it, ""a Twilight Zone for kids"" and in many ways the inspiration for another one of my favorite shows The Adventures Of Pete& Pete, mostly due to it's dark humor and mysterious nature. Although it should be noted that Eerie Indiana is somewhat darker and scarier than Pete & Pete, just so that concerned parents have fair warning. Marshall Teller and his friend Simon Holmes investigate the strange goings on in Eerie and record them in Marshall's journal along with a cabinet filled with actual artifacts from their weird adventures in hopes of someday revealing it to the world. Especially since they two are the only ones that know of the darker side of Eerie and no one else will beleive them. It's a great show but the DVD collection was unexpected since it was only 1.5 seasons long. It's lots of creepy fun though, I recomend it for those who are into this sort of thing. (Update 8/26/06) I noticed a fellow reviewer mensioned an unfilmed pirate episode. They would be correct. I just found out about it on a fan site, which will remain unnamed for legal reasons. The episode was listed as #20 and I wondered to myself ""What the heck are they talking about? There's no 20th episode, there were only nineteen"". Thanks to my fellow reviewer I now know the whole story. According to the fan site the episode was called ""The Jolly Rogers"" and was about a crew of pirates who return to Eerie after many years to reclaim their buried treasure. It must have been in pre-production when the show was cancelled. To bad, it sounds like it would have been a good one too. Also, and I know alot of my fellow Eerie fans are going to hate me for this, I would like to see The Other Dimension get it's own release. I know it was pretty bad but I would kind of like to revisit Mitchell Taylor and Stanley Hope. Hey, you have to admit with Marshal and Simon's guidance they were okay.

2163660,4,B00062WUQY,"Finally one of the greatest TV shows that I recall from my childhood appears in DVD format.  I lucked out, as I didn't even know it existed until I was browsing shows on DVD at a local Best Buy (where, note it is listed at $23.99).

As another reviewer mentioned, the transfer is HORRIBLE.  I'm not sure if a cheap telecine was performed here, or an old 1-nch transfer, but there is noise, bleed, and almost every other artifact you come to expect in a bad transfer apparent in almost every episode.  Including a ""strobing"" effect in the highlights of the image (what made me think that it's a new telecine).  But if you're committed to this show, you'll be forgiving of its blemishes.

Another thing to note:  as my receiver tells me, every episode has been ""remixed"" in Digital 5.1  At least it's being fed a 5.1 signal.  Though, don't let this fool you, as the ""mix"" is not a good mix at all.  All dialogue remains in both FL & FR, perhaps -some- in C.  It sounds like a bad stereo rip into 5.1 with very little attention paid to anything.

As well, TVtome lists Eerie as having 20 episodes, 2 which didn't air.  I recall seeing this unaired 19th episode ""Broken Record"" when Eerie was being replayed on some kids channel several years ago.  And as for the 20th episode not found on these discs, rumor has it that this was an episode that was written, but never aired.

Against all of these anti's - the box set definatley has some plusses.  If you want to see the old show in ""some of its glory"" make sure to check it out before it disappears off the shelves.  It probably won't be around for long.

I must admit that my personal intention was to relive my ""11-year-old"" experience and excitment of watching this series (and relishing the fact that a show was produced about my very own home-state), and then hand the discs off to my nephew.  But I will most likely be retaining this set for my own son to watch and enjoy a few years from now.

I agree with the other reviewers that the picture quality is a bit lacking, but as a fan of the series I'm willing to overlook it.  I haven't noticed a problem with the audio, but I haven't finished watching them all.  Also, I could swear that the ""un-aired episode"" was aired.  I haven't even opened that DVD, but I remember watching it.  (No this is not EERIE wierness.)  Unless I've gone crazy, the series aires twice.

2163662,5,B00062WUQY,"Before Goosebumps there was Eerie, Indiana, kind of a Goosebumps meets the Twilight Zone kind of show, aimed at young to young adult audience, but good enough to be enjoyed by everyone.  Omri Katz plays 13 year old Marshall whose family uproots him from New Jersey to the seemingly normal town of Eerie, Indiana.  All manner of strangeness abounds there and only Marshall, and his ten-year old sidekick Simon seem to know about it.  In each episode they encounter another strange side to Eerie.

You get 19 episodes in all.  Only 18 were aired so the 19th is a bit of a bonus.  A 20th episode was written but never filmed.  Here are some of the best episodes:

""Foreverware"" perhaps the most famous Episode.  A local woman sells ""foreverware"" kind of like Tupperware that keeps anything fresh...forever.  Marshall soon learns that the womans children have been kept children for decades by sleeping in giant foreverware beds!

""America's SCariest Home"" - Stuck having to baby-sit Simon's younger brother on Halloween, Marshall and Simon fool around with their video camera. Unfortunately they end up trapping him in a monster movie, while a mummy runs wild in their house.

""Dead Letter"" Guest stars Tobey maguire.  While browsing the basement of the local library, Marshall finds an old letter. He opens it and a young man appears who won't leave him alone until he delivers the letter in person.

""The Lost Hour"" - Marshal doesn't like the Indiana practice of ignoring daylight savings time, and sets his clock back an hour anyway. When he wakes up the next day, nobody's around... except some very untalkative garbage men, intent on sending him though the trash compactor.

""No Brain No Pain"" - A strange bum is assaulted by a woman with a ray gun. distracts her until the police arrive, and then Marshall decides to help out a bum after witnessing him being attacked by a woman with a ray gun. It is difficult though, because all he does is mumble nonsense, and reassemble electrical appliances into bizarre contraptions.

""The Broken Record"" this was the unaired show.  Marshall tries to get a gloomy friend to lighten up by showing him an album from the heavy metal band Pitbull Surfers, but soon the Eerie weirdness kicks in and the quiet overachiever is turned into rebellious headbanger.

The picture quality is average and there's no extras..it's a Gotham release, so what do you expect.  This was a fun and imaginative show and it's too bad it didn't last longer as it was fairly well written with a wry sense of humor.",1107993600,6,2530,4.8013856812933025

I was amazed to see Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling, Explorers) directing the pilot episode. I enjoy most of his films and its no wonder I liked it as a kid. I was also surprised to see this series released on DVD as it was really a failure on its initial release.

As Marshall Teller explains, Eerie is the center of weirdness for the entire universe.

My kids adored this show when their ages were in the single digits. Now we're watching it together again, & we're thrilled to see how well it held up.

Treat your family to this funny, imaginative, & slightly twisted series. It's rare to find a show that appeals equally to children & their parents.  Don't pass this one up!",1102723200,10,786,4.742647058823529

I'm french and just love this serie ! I  would like to know if there are subtitles in french on the DVD, I search this serie in DVD since many years here in France but it's not available... :(

This serie is the best I've ever seen, but here it's not so well known, but it should be !

thank you for answer me !",1102550400,,316,3.742424242424242
2163666,4,B00062WUQY,"First the good news:

""Eerie Indiana"" has aged very well since its debut a decade ago on NBC. It is long overdue for a DVD release, but with mega-hits like Friends, Frasier and Seinfeld getting the lion's share of attention when they come to DVD, it's easy to see how this gem of a show got left off the studio's to-do list.

Now that it has finally been released on DVD it's time for fans of the show to celebrate. You get all 18 episodes PLUS a 19th episode -- the one called ""Broken Record"" --which never aired!!

Now the bad news:
The box set is a decidely low budget affair. The packaging, what there is of it, is bland and flimsy. The DVD cases are slimline and there is no booklet to speak of. Episode titles and descriptions are found on the back of each individually shrink wrapped case. It is a hassle to have to tear open all five discs after having wrestled with the box itself -- they went way overboard on the plastic wrap here. But that's the least of the problems...

THE VIDEO TRANSFER IS NOT DIGITALLY REMASTERED! The video source appears to be from a good one-inch master tape. It is a little grainy in spots, but overall very good. But it should have been remastered.

The sound however is not that great. It's listenable, but some of Marshall Teller's narration is obscured by loud music in the muddy sound mix. I also noticed that some of the scene fades don't fade out completely before the next scene starts, and that's just sloppy mastering on BMG's part.

There are no subtitles, and sadly, no audio commentary track featuring the creators or star(s) or anyone connected with the show that could have shed some light on what we were watching.

But my nitpicking shouldn't stop you from purchasing this great show. It is doubtful we will ever see it again in any form unless there is a clamor by fans to purchase it now. Maybe BMG didn't think hardcore Eerie fans would want all the bells and whistles the more popular shows are getting when they finally come out on DVD. Of course, they were wrong. We want it all. We love this show.

Support this show by buying this DVD set. You will be THRILLED to see them all again.

I rate it 4 out of 5 stars because of the missing bonus material which would have been easy to include, and the less than A+ transfer.",1100476800,211,2282,4.375886524822695
2163667,4,B00062WUQY,"Eerie Indiana is the story of a normal 13 yr old named Marshall Teller who moves from New Jersey to the 'normal' town of Eerie Indiana, which is far from normal.  Marshall, with his best friend, Simon, go around solving the strange mysteries of the town in each episode.

The stories themselves are wonderfully played out.  There isn't an overly-done scream track like other children ghost stories shows made during the same time, and also this show isn't 'too scary' for most kids, too.  The show focuses more on being funny than scare, but it can still creep people out.  The stories themselves are 5/5.

The packaging, though, was my biggest upset (thus only the 4/5 rating overall).  I wan't really expecting much for a 5 dvd set at only $25, but there really could have been some improvements.  Each dvd's case and dvd artwork is the same as all the rest, except tinted a different color.  The case, which is the same image as on the front of the box, is Marshall by the Eerie Indiana sign.  Inside the case, there is no artwork which bugged me since the case themselves were clear and the insert could have easily be printed doubled sided.  The dvd has an image of just the sign, printed all in one neon color.  Each case was a slim case which helped the set take up little room but the dvds can fall out of the cases if held open upside-down.

Now, on to the technicals of the dvd.  As you might have heard, there are no extras what-so-ever.  Each dvd has 4 episodes except the first dvd has 3.  Each dvd has two english audio tracks, the original tv audio and the remastered 5.1 surround sound.  Each dvd has animated menus (which are quite nice).  The video quality on each dvd is only as good as what you saw on tv (which makes me think this could have been compressed better into fewer dvds).  The total episode count is 19 episodes or about 570 minutes.

At around $1 to $2 an episode, this set is well worth your money, just understand it wasn't meant to be a real 'show off' piece.",1099008000,18,1995,4.384196185286103
2163668,5,B00062WUQY,"This is one of those little known shows, back where i hail from you had to search the tv guide just to find it, i don't think it was ever on the same time twice-i managed to see most of the episodes and got the DVD to see the rest -its a great little show- probly to smart for its time-but were all grown up know and can enjoy the charm and decent show premise. get and enjoy it and let your kids watch them and tell all your friends.. if you ever wondered whatever happens to those missing socks that never come out of the dryer- the answer is within this set.....

2163669,4,B00062WUQY,"Eerie, Indiana was a show I used to love.  For a kids show - it was great.  A great mixture of spooky and strange material with your usual family show storylines.  I really enjoyed the odd stories this show had to offer.

The city on the show is called Eerie because of all the strange supernatural things that went on in this seemingly normal town.  A thirteen-year old kid moves to the town with his family;  him and a friend he meets go about investigating the strange occurances  -- writing things down in a journal.

There will be some guest stars who you might recognize like Denise Richards and Toby Maguire.  As well as classic actors like John Astin (Gomez on the Addams Family) and Rene Auberjonois (who was in Star Trek:  Deep Space Nine).

This show only lasted for one season, and there were two unaired episodes.  I don't know if those two episodes are included on this box set, if they are - than there should be 20 episodes in this set.  If not...than 18!

I enjoyed this set as a kid, and I still might today.",1097020800,5,1026,4.35978835978836
2163670,5,B00062WUQY,"I first saw ""Eerie, Indiana"" on FOX KIDS when it was airing alongside ""Goosebumps"". I loved it...and then it was taken off the air and I eventually forgot about it. I was only eight, but I was always into supernatural-themed shows, so I was watching ""The X-Files"". In 2000, I discovered a really awesome Disney series, ""So Weird"", and it quickly became my favorite series.

Shortly after, I remembered ""Eerie, Indiana"".

I ordered the three-episode disc from Amazon.com, and checked my mailbox every day waiting for it. When it finally came, I was able to see it. I quickly fell in love with the show again. It's very entertaining and well written. Yes, the storylines seem ridiculous, but something about the way the show was made suspends disbelief. ""So Weird"" is still my favorite show, followed by the ABC horror series ""Miracles"", but ""Eerie, Indiana"" is extremely close behind.

I will definitely be buying the box set.",1096761600,4,925,4.8789808917197455
