7997321,5,B0000AISIC,"Loved this when it aired after the watershed on BBC in 2000 and delighted to find it on dvd;  it's well worth several viewings.  The six, 30 minute episodes are all on disc 1 with not-to-be-missed deleted scenes, outtakes, interviews, etc on disc 2;  luckily for many, there are subtitles.  If you want overt comedy or object to frequent references to sex, don't buy this.  But if you have a droll sense of humour, enjoy satire, and appreciate black comedy this is a wonderful way to spend 3 hours.",1429056000,,498,4.550561797752809
7997322,5,B0000AISIC,"dark british humor at it's finest, if you don't know Julia Davis this is a great intro to one of the funniest women in the world.",1392249600,,129,4.0
7997323,5,B0000AISIC,You just can't believe some of the things they say to eachother or to the camera!  British comedy at its best.  Each episode is a different setting...but they're always in a relationship.  It's dark comedy at its best....makes you think 'are there really couples out there like this?' LOL. A must buy for your collection.,1366588800,,321,4.8
7997324,5,B0000AISIC,"This mockumentary highlighting the relationship between six mostly profoundly mismatched couples in as many episodes is one of the most disturbingly funny, beautifully shot, and tightly scripted series I have ever seen.

Rob Brydon and Julia Davis both wrote and acted in the series; each portrays a palette of characters which is each convincing and beautifully developed, distinct, and with real depth.  If it weren't for its restrained twistedness, you would be convinced these were genuine people- it just looks so documentary.  Half the time, you won't know whether you should be laughing or crying as the darkly desperate details of the mundane and mostly banal misery of each couples' lives unfold - I know you're thinking crying is the proper answer, but I was borderline hypoxic much of the time because this dark desperation comes cloaked in brilliant, straight-faced absurdity.  The scary thing is, we all know people who are not so far removed from these characters, and the series is like a looking glass into their inner workings.

There is nothing slapstick about Human Remains- this is comedy best watched with your ears more than your eyes- and much of it is subtle.  Because of this, you can watch the series time after time, and each time get a slightly different take than the last time.  Now, that's value for money.  This series is a work of genius and worthy of great respect.

If you cannot view a Region 2 product, the effort to find it in your region will be more than well worth it.",1188604800,6,1509,4.817829457364341
