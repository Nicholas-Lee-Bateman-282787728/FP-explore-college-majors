The work of Oliver Stone stands as one of the greatest creative bodies of work in the history of film. And sure, they are brilliantly filmed, written, performed and photographed, but Stone's work is appreciated because of the power and influence it weilds. Unlike typical directors, Stone's films make us think and look at ourselves in the mirror. Some of the films here like ""JFK"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" serve in fact, as important film documents of the 20th century. ""Wall Street"" is a brilliant study of greed in American society. It uses the world of the stock market as a backdrop to explore the themes of ambition, greed, lust and power. ""Born On The Fourth Of July"" is one of the best films ever about Vietnam, a powerful story about a man who thought he was doing the right thing for his country and returned a crippled, disillusioned man. ""The Doors"" is the greatest rock film of all time. Val Kilmer gives a stunning performance, almost on the verge of possession, as Jim Morrison. The concert scenes are amazing and with the authenticity of a documentary. It's also an effective study of how excess can kill a great artist. Then comes ""JFK,"" the best film in the collection. Here Stone paints a disturbing, powerful portrait of the forces that killed John F. Kennedy. It is a study of how politics and power work in the world. ""Natural Born Killers,"" a stunning stylish wild ride, is a brilliant satire about violence and our obsession with violence in the world. ""Any Given Sunday"" is the best football movie of all time! I was a little disappointed with the extra documentary, ""Oliver Stone's America,"" which is interesting and watchable but is just a simple conversation. The extra Charlie Rose interview in the ""Natural Born Killers"" DVD is enough. But here we have work that is obviously done by a genius. He is willing to cross the line to present something that opens the eyes and mind. His films are haunting, hypnotic, stylish, intelligent and provocative. This special collection is jam-packed with extra material. ""The Doors"" and ""JFK"" are special two-disc editions that have deleted scenes and in the case of ""The Doors,"" a special making-of documentary. Be warned, ""Natural Born Killers"" is not the Director's Cut, but the original version. However, edited scenes found in the Director's Cut are on the DVD. Oliver Stone is probably the most important American director currently producing films. This is a unique, powerful collection of film, of provocative art.",980899200,10,2580,4.879271070615034
