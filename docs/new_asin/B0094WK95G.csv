5262591,5,B0094WK95G,Super funny. Im glad i have all the episodes now. I can watch over and over again anytime. I love watching it in Japanese. Just wish i didn't have to go through the trouble to download the script and put it on my tablet  so i can watch and read. Just subtitle it people!!,1378771200,,271,4.018518518518518
5262592,5,B0094WK95G,Just as funny and as exciting as the previous box set. Would recommend this series to anyone who likes a good anime.,1374278400,,116,4.318181818181818
5262593,5,B0094WK95G,"This was amazing! Very Clear and Very Funny. For all you BoBoBo fans, this is a must buy!! Brand New with clear audio!!",1365120000,,119,4.217391304347826
5262594,5,B0094WK95G,"If you've seen the first part, this is just as great. Worth every penny. Get it! Love the narrator! I quite enjoy the rock-paper-scizzors segment and the related fortune telling at the end. Fun stuff! Probably for nonsense per square inch, you won't find a better series. However, there are some great ones out there I'd recommend: Sgt. Frog, Tokyo Pig, Papuwa, and Digi Charat Nyo. And movies: Dead Leaves and Redline.",1363910400,,419,4.833333333333333
5262595,5,B0094WK95G,"Granted, this set would've been better...for an anime fan...if the Japanese language track ALSO had some subtitles to go with it.  But the English dub is fun enough and suitable for the craziness of the anime itself.",1359936000,3,216,4.837837837837838
5262596,5,B0094WK95G,"This anime on a whole is just a testament to how far people are willing to go to make from of other anime's. Bobobo-bo bo-bobo is in its essence a parody of Dragon ball Z, but it doesn't take itself seriously at all. From memorable characters and lines to it's ""deep"" story.

This anime had me laughing fairly hard and I can easily say that this is one of my favorites just because of that.

This item in particular is part two in the series and picks up where ""Bobobo-bo bo-bobo: The complete series 1"" leaves off.

If you find yourself a fan of ""Excel Saga,"" or ""Chromartie High."" This anime is a solid addition to your library and adds hours of laughter. Don't be afraid of checking it out!",1359244800,2,693,4.315384615384615
5262597,5,B0094WK95G,"Bobobo is one of those Anime that gets different opinions from different people. I Know several people that have watched this show and some say it's stupid and some say it's funny. I find some of it to be stupid, but mostly it's so stupid that I can't stop laughing at times. This set comes packed with episodes 37 - 76 for a solid 36 Episode Box Set. This set does not have subtitles but does have both Original Japanese and English Dubbed Audio available.

Overall, I'm glad that a company managed to fully release this series on dvd since the last company that did so didn't make it past the 3rd volume.

As for recommending this product, I would advise finding a stream or video clips of this show to try first before buying to see if this is an anime that fits your style.",1354492800,10,777,4.315068493150685
5262598,5,B0094WK95G,"When we last left our hair-brained heroes, Bo-BoBo, Don Patch, Jelly Jiggler, as well as Beauty and Suzu were climbing up the Tower in the middle of Holy Guacamole Land. Before that, Bo-BoBo and Jelly broke Garbel of Manacuria's nails, and Don Patch showed us the power of being a Meathead! Oh, and Softon, our Pink-Swirly-headed guy joins the group for the remainder of the series! Which brings us to what we'll come to expect in the next set!

In the second half of the series, expect more Wigged Out Wackiness from our heroes, with such uncut highlights as...

- The Service Area, now with added Service Man!
- Some scenes not even seen in the Edited Versions
- The Remaining Fusions: Denbo, PatchBoBo, and Mr. BoJiggler!
- The Polygon Super Fist of the Nose Hair: Retro Game Playin' Action!
- Professional Patch and the Return of the Wiggin' Gang (minus the Underboss)
- Hatenko and Torpedo Girl returning
- and the final lines of the show:

Bo-BoBo: I, BoBoBo-Bo Bo-BoBo, will protect the peace and freedom of your hair!
Everyone: YEAH!
DengakuMan: Wait! (everyone else: huh?) Here's the sign! The sign says it's The End! (laughs)
Everyone Else: ARE YOU KIDDING?! THIS IS HOW OUR SHOW ENDS?! (they weep as it fades)

As with the first set, don't expect any English subtitles for the Japanese Language Dub, but you never might know. In any case, have an iPad or whatever tablet ready for the use of it, okay?",1350172800,4,1412,4.658634538152611
5262599,5,B0094WK95G,"Yes I loved part 1 of this funny series and now I can finish this amazing anime! If you haven't yet seen bo bo bo, I highly recommend it.",1346716800,2,137,3.7586206896551726
8536045,5,B0094WK95G,The second half of the series is so random and hilarious I love it.,1466035200,,67,3.857142857142857
8536046,5,B0094WK95G,This is one of those series that can take you back to when you were a kid. It's still just as funny as I remember it.,1461024000,,117,3.5384615384615383
8536047,5,B0094WK95G,ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVIORTE SHOWS FINALLY ON DVD I USE TO WATCH THIS WHEN IT WAS ON LATE NIGHTS ON CARTOON NETWORK ON TOONAIMA,1445904000,,125,4.04
8536048,1,B0094WK95G,"These people are too lazy/cheap to put subtitles on a DVD. Instead you're supposed to open up a PDF and somehow read along with that as you're watching the show!! Ridiculous! Avoid, avoid, avoid!",1437696000,,195,4.764705882352941
8536049,5,B0094WK95G,"Let's get one thing out of the way. I love this show. When it first aired on Toonami back in ""the day"", I couldn't get enough of it.  I even recorded episodes on tape (I think I'm the only one who still uses a VCR).  As such, you can guess that it came as an incredible disappointment when the show not only no longer aired, but was only available on two DVDs containing only the first 8 episodes.
The show itself is insane. Crazy, random humor almost literally coming from nowhere (seriously, what does walking on a rainbow and poor singing have to do with playing a board game?).  Though every episode has jokes galore, they're not all winners, especially not in the earliest ones.
There is one warning though, even for fans of the series: this series is not complete.  I watched the whole thing to the last episode and kept wondering how they were going to wrap things up with so many new characters being introduced as late as four or five episodes before the end.  They weren't.  I know it sounds like I'm ruining the ending, but there isn't one, so I can't (technically) ruin it.  Instead, the whole show ends with another impending battle.  Why?  Well, the whole thing has apparently decided to join the ranks of other anime (such as Inu-Yasha and Berserk) that are essentially long commercials for the manga.  That's right, if you want the whole story, you'll have to pick up the manga as well.  Not interested? Then prepare to be disappointed.
There is hope, though.  The two anime I mentioned have recently started making continuations/remakes that adapt the entire manga to TV. So maybe this series will follow.  It took a while, but the whole thing finally made it to DVD. So maybe it's just a matter of time before the rest of the story follows.",1426636800,,1758,4.542857142857143
8536050,5,B0094WK95G,"This is the best series ever that I've ever seen ever.  You need to buy it, it's your solemn duty.",1412035200,,98,3.9
8536051,5,B0094WK95G,Awesome,1410134400,,7,7.0
8536052,5,B0094WK95G,Its FRIGGIN BOBOBOBOBBOBOBOBOBOBOBOBOBO if you like crazy humor or just insane stuff in general this is the show for you. I Love this show even though 99% of the time I have no idea what the heck is going on. The show is crazy and has some really deep humor that I love. I would put this show in the same boat as Xavier: Renegade Angel.,1406764800,,336,4.106060606060606
8536053,5,B0094WK95G,"Probably the funniest anime series I have ever seen and is very enjoyable. Even though some people complain about how there is no English subtitles for the Japanese version, who cares? Watch it English, you'll enjoy it alot more.",1396483200,,229,4.897435897435898
