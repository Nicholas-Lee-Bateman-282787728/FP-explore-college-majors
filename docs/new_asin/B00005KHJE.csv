7943479,2,B00005KHJE,"This movie must have been a tax write off. It was cheap. The acting was so bad it was almost funny. The CGI FX were ok. The plot and story were laughable. I liked goofing on this movie. Make sure your drinking when you watch this.

This is just a bad movie.",1108771200,,257,3.9423076923076925
