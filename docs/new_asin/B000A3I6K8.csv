8074031,1,B000A3I6K8,Doesn't work in American DVD players. Its a region 2 DVD set and it will not work unless you have a multi-region DVD player. Most retail stores do not sell multi-region DVD players. You can order them. It will work in a ps4 or Xbox one if you switch the regions,1509667200,,261,4.137254901960785

8074035,4,B000A3I6K8,"The other reviews , are not reviews at all. They got the wrong region and complained on wrong place. This is a single, double sided DVD. Not much in extras. American Graffiti is a classic! It came out when I was13. Loved it, went to the theatre about 6 or 7 times to watch it. More American Graffiti isn't as good as 1st one, but still worth watching. If you want synopsis, please check elsewhere. If your a fan of these movies, this is a great disc(just make sure you get correct region).",1490659200,,489,4.268817204301075
