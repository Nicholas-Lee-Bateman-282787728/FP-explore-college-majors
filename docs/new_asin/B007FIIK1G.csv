The film quality is very poor, almost pixilated. Neither my partner or I could follow the instruction. It's hard enough to get your partner to take dance lessons with you... this video did not help. Very disappointed.",1502409600,,348,4.8

8515742,4,B007FIIK1G,"This review is written from the point of view of someone who is an absolute beginner to Argentine tango, and a beginner to all dance.  And this is a beginner's video. So, please, consider both the reviewer's background and the intent of the video.

The format of the video is a half-hour of talk and tango demonstration by Alex Krebs and partner Jenna Rohrbacher, both part of the Portland, Oregon tango community.  This is volume 1 of a 7-volume series.  All the videos are described at Krebs website TangoBerretin.  Krebs describes the moves while dancing.  There is no off-screen voice.  Rohrbacher demonstrates, but does not say a word.  According to the website, the video consists of the following sixteen parts:
 1.  Welcome  0:20.
 2.  About Argentine Tango  2:41
 3.  Posture and Walk  1:12
 4.  Embrace, Connection, and Musicality  2:36
 5.  Left-Turning Check Step  1:17
 6.  Basic Right Turn  1:11
 7.  Ocho Cortado  2:03
 8.  Media Vuelta  1:50
 9.  The Cross  1:59
10.  Front Ochos  1:57
11.  The Cross in Cross System  2:03
12.  Back Ochos  1:29
13.  Molinete (Giro)  2:31
14.  Right Turn  1:57
15.  Demo Using All the Elements  1:50
16.  Etiquette  2:04
Studying  the video confirms that it conforms with these 16 parts.  The camera angle is a general view of the dancers and the studio.  There are no close-ups of footwork, holds, or other aspects.

We decided to buy the seven-day rental for less than two dollars.  We actually got 8 daily sessions of dancing in this period for a total of about 9 hours.  What a bargain.  For a beginner, there is a lot of content in the video, both described and undescribed, and we could have spent easily twice the time, and still not have absorbed everything.  And this is supposed to be a beginner's lesson, which is meant to teach survival Argentine tango skills.  Krebs and Rohrbacher do make it look easy.  The instruction format was gentle on the viewer.  On-camera dialog was by Krebs.  He talks about the moves and background while demonstrating moves with Rohrbacher.  There were no abrupt snippets of videos.  No off-camera voiceovers.  The few graphics were tasteful.  Easy to watch.  Old-school.  Nice.  Krebs gives easy explanations in good, non-technical English.  Occasionally what he says to do, and what he does are slightly different, but if you look at other web videos, this does not seem to be uncommon for dancers, even good dancers.  For us, the descriptions were often not detailed enough, but then again, there was only a half-hour, so how much detail can he included.  Rohrbacher's bright shoes and lower legs contrast clearly against the dance floor.  Krebs' black shoes, and therefore his foot moves, were difficult to see because of his large dark trouser cuffs and no color contrast.  Sometimes their moves were obscured by the camera angle.  Lower leg and foot closeups would have been helpful.  On the TangoBerretin website are short demos of the videos.

There are some minor annoyances.  Only this beginner's volume 1 is available for rental at this low price.  It would be nice to rent the other volumes this cheaply.  This could just be marketing.  Also, Amazon's Instant Video system has technical glitches.  We had to fiddle with the advanced settings.  And we had to restart the application repeatedly.  Did not downgrade the review on this technicality because this is Amazon's problem.  Third, Krebs has a foot tap when he initiates a foot move.  I assume this is a personal idiosyncrasy.

Would I rent this again?  Certainly, and especially for the price.  It is a very good introduction to an intimidating dance.  It would be best if you had at least some social dance training.  And you need a dance partner and a daily commitment of an hour or so.  At this price, the monetary cost is not the issue.  The real cost is your time.  The video could be improved, as noted previously.  Those with Argentine tango experience may want to pass on this beginner's video.  And, of course, you probably should seek local instruction in addition to, or subsequent to, this video.

Recommendation: Rent this video for 7 days and practice diligently if you are an absolute beginner to Argentine tango.  If you have more experience, this beginner's video is probably not for you.  But then again, for $1.99...?

Update 19 October 2013

After 16 weeks of tango instruction and practice, it is time to add to the above review.  In the world of tango, 16 weeks so trivial that it hardly gives one the right to give advice, but perhaps the following comments will save others some time and grief.

The Krebs video is not bad as an introduction for the absolute beginner.  However, learning real tango, particularly for the lead, is a serious undertaking, which cannot be gained from this or any other video.  You need serious instruction and examples.  And this is where the problem lies. Argentine tango, as danced in the milongas of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas, is a unique dance that cannot be taught by standard dance instructional methods, which use sequences of steps.  Unfortunately, with rare exception, this is how the dance is taught in the USA.  If you learn by this method, you will learn what they call in Buenos Aires, tourist tango.  Unlike real tango, this is a low-level stage tango adapted to the social dance floor.  You will not be able to dance properly with partners who know the real thing.  And you will have to start over from scratch if you want to dance the real deal.  It is up to you.  It is your time.  And it is your dance preference.

Perhaps the best ""instructional video"" for tango is to download and examine carefully, frame by frame if needed, authentic examples of tango dancing actually IN THE MILONGAS OF BUENOS AIRES, or demo dances by those who are have danced in those milongas for decades. Look at tangoandchaos website for videos.  Also listen to the interviews of milongeros and final demo dances on website by Monica Paz.

Still, Krebs' video is a good buy at this price.",1368316800,8,6020,4.776908023483366
8515743,5,B007FIIK1G,"While this won't teach you how to dance the tango (you really do need an instructor and someone to dance with), it does cover the basics in a very clear manner.  Alex gives you a lot of excellent advice and information which you may or may not hear in a class.  I'd say it's a must not only for beginners, but those with some experience as well.  Alex is one of the best teachers I know (and I've had classes with many), and every word is a pearl.  The moves and information on this DVD, and a little practice can get you on the dance floor without embarrassment.",1354752000,3,563,4.185185185185185
