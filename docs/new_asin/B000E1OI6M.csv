I'd highly recommend this film to all Eric Roberts fans. He has done a great job in this film, so has Kirk Harris.",1397260800,,283,4.071428571428571

8180523,1,B000E1OI6M,"This story would have been better told in a half hour or (maybe) even an hour long show.  It drags on and on and on, and even though you want to know what happens to most of the characters, getting there is almost painful.  It does show how drugs destroy lives, but there are so many unnecessary scenes and some that don't even make any sense.  The actors are okay, but their talent is wasted in this snooze-fest.  It tries to tell a story about a doctor who steals prescription medications and ends up trading them for illegal drugs, and it throws in alcohol abuse for good measure. But in the final analysis, ultimately it misses.",1348358400,,632,4.422413793103448
8180524,1,B000E1OI6M,"It is a shame that Eric Roberts isn't have the actor his sister is but in this movie, he was probably the best.  That might give you a clue as to how bad this movie is.  It drags out a story line, that probably could be covered in a half hour TV program, into a 108 minute boring movie. The acting doesn't even rate a B movie and the camera work is also very disappointing.  I don't think they used more then 5 sets to film the whole thing.",1306713600,2,440,3.9213483146067416
8180525,4,B000E1OI6M,"This is a stylish, ""addictive"" story.  I enjoyed seeing Eric Roberts in it.  If you are a fan of the TV series ""House"", you may enjoy this movie as it deals with drug addiction in the medical profession.",1255737600,,203,4.315789473684211
8180526,5,B000E1OI6M,"Very well done film about a doctors descent into drug addiction. If you like Leaving Las Vegas, Drugstore Cowboy or The Boost you will enjoy this movie.",1143504000,6,152,4.666666666666667
