8312349,2,B001JAHRK6,"Picket Fences was one of the best shows on TV, it had started to get a few not that entertaining episodes on the third season DVD set, but it really dropped the ball in Season 4.  Some of the main cast only have a few episodes no doubt either being committed elsewhere on not liking what they were reading in the scripts.  Gone from Season 4 were the staple quirky trials each episode revolving around something bizarre occurring in Rome.  We only go into Judge Bone's courtroom a couple of times such as a grandmother trying to get custody of a baby because her son is gay, the kids of Zac's basketball league trying to get an injunction against their parents attending their games, an Amish rape victim not wanting to testify against her attacker due to her elders ruling not to, and the pope being made to testify as the witness to a murder that everyone else initially thought was a suicide.

Don Cheadle leaves the series in an early episode when his character's brother breaks out of jail. His is the only character in the show that gets a proper send off for the audience.  Lauren Holly isn't in many episodes with her hairstyle changing no doubt to reflect other stuff she was acting in when she would briefly come back.  In fact an initial theme is that Kenny broke up with her because she became a blonde.  There was actually a few episodes where they could have given her character a great send off but they obviously chickened out of doing it.  There's a new cop, Bud Skeeter, who gives Kenny a lot of bad advice and attends patrols.  The show also introduced an earlier episodes rival for Jill, who becomes the person she can talk to about her issues in later ones with Doctor Diamond, a doctor who has a call in and chat TV show who wants to buy Jill's surgery that Jill doesn't want to sell.  Jill was never the most likable character in Rome, but the writers take this to new heights in Season 4, with her treating Jimmy terribly the entire season, she throws a tantrum at Zac's birthday party (a party that made no sense as it just had all the adult main characters attending, no kids his own age).  Even while angry throws the fact she's not Kimberly's biological mother in her face, and can't even be nice when her own friends are getting married.  Really you were waiting for Jimmy to say ""I'm sick of this Jill, I'm filing for divorce!"" the whole season, which unfortunately never happens.

Carter becomes more of a central character in Season 4, after unsuccessfully trying to kill himself taking up the hobby of quilting, and falling for the sewing machine shop assistant who is also socially challenged.  Most of episodes for all the characters revolve around marriage, family or relationship problems for everyone in Rome.  Even Judge Bone and Wambaugh have entire episodes about their relationship problems or regrets.  It's really quite a boring season.  The only episode I remembered from when I watched before I re-watched was Zac putting his teacher's head on a woman taking off a bra video on a computer ruining the teacher's life.

Season 4 doesn't have the wealth of guest stars that earlier seasons had.  There is a young and thinner Jack Black who originally appears as an angry guy in a hot dog suit who Max shoots, then we (and Max) find him again wearing a cat leotard and makeup inside a snowed in trailer freaking out because he can't get to the local theater where he is starring in Cats.  Alyson Hannigan (who a year later would star as Willow in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) has a very brief appearance in the Amish episode.  That's pretty much it though.

Earlier seasons of Picket Fences were a must watch, but half way through season 4 I was sort of forcing myself to keep watching hoping for a flash of the brilliance of previous seasons to appear, but it never did.  Not a season worth owning, but definitely get the first three.  There are no special features on any of the DVDs in this Season Four set.",1468281600,3,3949,4.529577464788733

8312351,1,B001JAHRK6,"This season was a travesty of the true Picket Fences for a very good reason.

The first three seasons (the true Picket Fences) were written by David E. Kelley.  It was his series, and seasons one through three are the very best examples of his work on any TV series.

But - if I remember the reports - the powers-that-be wanted David to be less hands-on in season 4 so he could focus on starting other shows.  SO - the fourth season was written by at least 10 different writers, with David only writing maybe 2 of these 21 episodes - and it shows.  Even the actors on the show were embarrassed by this season.  The writing is very uneven, and the show completely lost David Kelley's magical touch.

Only watch this season to spend a little more time with the actors you love - one of the best ensemble casts ever - and, for the most part, try to ignore the plots.",1368662400,3,863,4.257668711656442
8312352,5,B001JAHRK6,"The negativity and its insistence coming from the first reviewer makes me, for one, ask: was it the same series of episodes which s/he and I saw?

As the title of my review states, I believe this was the best of all series of 'Picket Fences'. It was the only series which started to delve more deeply into the characters of the show. This is in contrast to series 1-3, which aimed at artificially sensationalizing the goings on within the fictional town of Rome, Wisconsin.

I particularly recall episode six, 'Heart of Saturday night' which - as the title of the episode suggests - brought forth heart to the town of Rome. It was nicely balanced between regular characters in the show and some one off characters brought in for this one episode. Another episode in season four followed Matthew Brock for the entire episode . Matthew Brock was played by Justin Shenkarow. He was the teenage son (middle child) of Sheriff Jimmy Brock (played by Tom Skerritt. Character focus (and development) like that was/is rarely seen in television series and I, for one, enjoyed it - thoroughly.

I have added my email address to the notification service on Amazon.com and will buy it if/when it comes out. I look forward to doing so and revisiting this long, lost series.

Update - 4 October 2016.

I purchased a copy, as indicated/promised above. Have now re-seen all episodes. I enjoyed the season and, from memory, it was more complex than the first three seasons. Matthew Brock is the one who ends 'Picket Fences' on a high note. So too, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, Sheriff Jimmy Brock. In short, we humans are complex enough in our own right; no need to be sensationalizing - even though, alas, that did creep into season four as well.

I am too late (>90 days) to leave a review of the product under the seller's profile. The last disk in the box set was a bit tricky in terms of getting it to play. I managed it but only after some 'fiddling around'. I initially received season three by mistake. As instructed (by AtomicMovies), I sent it back in the original packaging; upon which I was sent season four. All's well that ends well.",1345766400,5,2136,4.6078947368421055
8312353,1,B001JAHRK6,"While I own Season 1, and devoutly wish (make that DEMAND) they release seasons 2 and 3, please skip this season.  If Season 3 was the BEST season of ANY U.S. television show (and it was), this season ranks among the worst!  As far as I'm concerned, Picket Fences ended in Season 3.  I refuse to even recognize the existence of this season.",1341446400,3,340,4.365079365079365
