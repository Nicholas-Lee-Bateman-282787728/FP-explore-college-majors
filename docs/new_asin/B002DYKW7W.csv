8366435,5,B002DYKW7W,"If you love watching chefs prepare dishes then you will adore this DVD. The producer does something really interesting. He has people in his family make the dishes from recipes and then has Chef Michel Guerard make the recipes from memory while filming the process. I laughed with delight when the producer's two sons made the apple with lime souffl. How adorable to have kids make one of the recipes.

There are scenes from a busy restaurant kitchen to enjoy as well. But mostly you will see Chef Michel Guerard preparing foods on his own. He also describes his approach to cooking and says his recipes are like famous paintings. The presentation is quite artistic.

Have you ever made every recipe in a book? Well the producer of this film made all of Chef Michel Guerard's recipes. He shows the stained pages of the book in the film.

So this was highly entertaining with burst of humor and lots of creatitivity.

The only thing missing is the actual recipes. I'm thinking maybe there is an English translation of his book? I'll have to look around.

8366436,5,B002DYKW7W,"I bought this for my son-in-law who is an Exec Pastry Chef in San Francisco. It was a Christmas gift, and he liked it a lot. It was one he didn't have already. That's good because this was on his Christmas list in 2011. So the rating is based on his response and reaction to this gift for him.",1357257600,,293,3.983050847457627
8366437,5,B002DYKW7W,"Michel Guerard is (in)famous for Nouveau Cuisine, now something like forty years old. Here he is shown in a French documentary creating new dishes, a new menu, for his restaurant. It's one of the few places that the chef's creativity is on full display. This is a niche film for sure, but it's quite fascinating. There's another film in this series available looking at Paul Ganaire (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inventing-Cuisine-Paul-Ganaire/dp/B000WC37TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inventing Cuisine: Paul Ganaire</a>).
