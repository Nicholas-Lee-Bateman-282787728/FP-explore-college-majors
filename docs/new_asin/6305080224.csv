967675,4,6305080224,"This may not be the best dvd package put together about Alice Cooper, but it is worth your time if you're a hardcore fan.  The whole documentary is from the Hey Stoopid era(91) so you won't see any commentary on Last Temptation or Brutal Planet.  It is pretty informative about Alice's early years, but it suffers from what so many of these documentaries suffer from-you don't see the videos in their entirety.  A few of them, yes, like Elected, I'm 18 and Poison, but I would have liked to see all of Black Juju, Clones, Hey Stoopid and Levity Ball.  Plus, Alice just totally skips over his Special Forces/Zipper Catches Skin/Dada/Constrictor/Raise Your Fist and Yell days.  These albums may not be favorites amongst fans, but I would have really liked to hear what Alice had to say about them(I've always wondered what he thought of those albums, don't you?).  Yes, the second dvd's game is quite annoying-I'm not sure why it's even on the disc.  You can access the entire documentary without having to play Chutes and Ladders.  Just go to Alice's website to find out, I can't remember offhand.  The documentary on the second disc is quite interesting, it's more recent.  Despite it's shortcomings, I do enjoy watching this from time to time, and it is an essential piece to the hardcore fans' collection",1062288000,2,1306,4.764444444444444
967676,4,6305080224,"A totally worthwhile double disc set. This gives one view of ""Alice"", and uses dated material that has it's limitations; but since a perennial star like Alice has been around since the 60s, there is bound to be some fall in Master tape quality. The first disc is a gem, all Alice, no filler. The Coopergame format for the clips on the second disc is original, and very surreal. If you want a good view of Alice in other formats, look at BRUTALLY YOURS(2000 concert tour in London), and if you can get it, RETURN TO THE NIGHTMARE 1986( VHS tape). No Single disc or even double disc set could ever give an adequate view of the Alice. Like Alice Says:""... I designed this generation...""
Alice is one of a handful of stars who still fire on all cylinders and this 1991 documentary gives a dated, but still valid view.",1035417600,2,813,4.426666666666667
967677,5,6305080224,"Here we have a very nicely presented dvd package. Disc 1 is a great documentry of the legends career with interviews and live footage. Quality. Disc 2, now then...this is a bit of fun; it offers very up to date interviews and cool rare live footage only accesable via an interactive game of snakes and ladders! Bizarre but appealing. However it does grow very tedious wen u want to see the xtra footage and have to go through this process.
This is the one and only problem with a great dvd. An awesome package for any fan of alice's work.",1004745600,2,538,4.39
967678,4,6305080224,"Prime Cuts on DVD is an excellent review of the coops history which varies slightly from the video cassette version. The only reason why it doesnt get 5 stars is because it only covers his career up to Hey Stoopid now several years and albums past. This has been rectified with the very recent release of the Prime Cuts LTD edition DVD with an extra 40 plus minutes of footage (get this one if you can).However this is still a very good buy for the fan who wants to know more about this legendary showman,BUY IT!.",1004659200,,513,4.354166666666667
967679,2,6305080224,"The VHS of Prime Cuts was frustrating to watch.
I realized that the VHS edition had limitations as far as length of clips, but it was still hard to see just a minute of ""Black Ju Ju"" and ""Dwight Fry"" live with the original band.
Longtime fans like myself want as much of the original band as possible in these compilations.
Problem solved with the re-done DVD version, right?
NO! These are still just clips, NOT THE FULL-LENGTH versions! Geez....who put this thing together anyway?
The ""Alice Cooper Virtual Jukebox"" feature will have the full-length versions, right?
No, this is just an direct access to the clips in Prime Cuts via a page designed like an old jukebox. Whoopee...
Wait! Disc 2 has ""Over 80 minutes of comprehensive supplemental material assembled specially for this DVD"", that will have the full-length clips of the original band, right?
No, it is an annoying, little game you play where you roll the dice on the screen to access different clips.
If you land on square 100, you can watch the entire feature all at once.
There has to be an easter egg for this but I haven't found it yet. It would be just like this stupid DVD not to have one.
The feature is different interview clips of Alice, Mike Bruce, Neil Smith, Dennis Dunaway and Dick Wagner from the Behind the Music show on VH-1, I think. It's pretty good because it's ALWAYS good to see the original lineup, ya see.
The incredibly stupid thing about it is that each clip leads into a FULL-LENGTH live song clip from the Brutal Live concert vid or The Nightmare Returns vid.
They interview the original band ONLY (plus Wagner) and then feature the 1986 and 2000 lineups ONLY via the clips! Huh?
These were fine shows (especially the Brutal vid), but why do they keep the material most wanted by the fans in the vault?
Anyone that would buy this DVD already has Brutally Live and The Nightmare Returns anyway.
Alice Cooper finally let some live material with the original band go on the Billion Dollar Babies 2CD reissue early in 2001.
I sure hope he has plans to make more of the original band's live material available via CD or DVD.
The Prime Cuts (Limited Edition 2-Disc Set) DVD release here is a big disappointment.",1004486400,37,2195,4.587786259541985
967680,4,6305080224,"""Alice Cooper - Prime Cuts"" is a terrific documentary tracing the Coop's career from his earliest days to the early 90s. It has been available on DVD for some time. It is very good with some rare and wild footage and is nicely reviewed in a number of places. This DVD presents the documentary in anamorphic wide screen with 5.1 sound. It looks and sounds great.
The question here is the 80+ minutes of new material available on a second disc in this limited edition release. And the answer is that despite a noble effort, in the end, this new material fails to deliver.
Starting with the noble effort, the additional material consists of interviews and performances - natch. But they actually went to the trouble of interviewing the guys from the original Alice Cooper Group. Their comments are intercut with comments from Alice leading up to a performance of a song. Here's where the disappointment begins.
These musical performances are fairly recent. They are shot in such a way as to only reveal Alice - you can't see which band is doing the playing. And it appears they were shot without an audience creating a deadness, a flatness, no reaction or energy for Cooper to bounce off of. Indeed, stack these performances against the same songs captured on the ""Brutally Live"" DVD and they pale considerably.
It was great that they filmed the original guys for the interviews. But what this release called for was the unearthing of more rare videos, film, and concert performances from the old days.
The final disappointment comes with the second disc itself. The material on the second disc is accessible through this rather frustrating ""board game"" interface. Every time you choose ""Play"" on the menu, it just replays the menu. You must choose ""Coopergame."" This brings up a playing board reminiscent of the old ""Chutes and Ladders"" game but showing chains and snakes. By pressing the ""Enter"" key on your remote, a purple dice rolls across the screen - its final number causing an indictor to move along the board. Everytime you hit the top of a chain, you get to see a videoclip from the disc.
Now this would have been okay - fun even - if it gave you access to some hidden material. But as the only way into the main items, it's just a nuisance.",1004400000,7,2249,4.681818181818182
967681,1,6305080224,"This is a reissue of Prime Cuts with bonus material on a 2nd disc. The first disc/edition was good but Alice speaks of the original band as if they were dead, not bothering to include them in this retrospective except in the 3rd person. The 2nd disc on the reissue seems to rectify this by adding new footage of the original band being interviewed, or does it??? To view the 2nd disc material you need to play some stupid snakes and ladders game by rolling some on screen dice with your remote buttons. This is absolutely insane and is an absolute nightmare. I just want to watch the damn video!!! There are a few tips on various on line Alice Cooper fan web sites on how to bypass some of this madness but if your DVD player is not configured like the tips require, you're out of luck.

I was trying to time the dice rolls and chapter skipping on my remote and I could hear my DVD tray spinning and agonizing trying to keep up with my remote. I just want to see the video!!! Well my expensive DVD/Player/Recorder broke. Trying to make this stupid game work broke my DVD player/recorder.

Maybe the conspiracy stories of Alice and his manager trying to erase the history of the original band is true. ""OK we'll give em some interviews  with the old band but just let em try and view it. Evil laughter...ha ha ha ha ha!!!""",985564800,,1321,4.361788617886178
967922,5,6305080224,"This is a great DVD that shows a lot of footage never before seen, with excellent interviews as well.  The original Cooper band was the best, and to find out more info than from any other source all for this price, you'll be in love!!  Quality DVD and quick shipping!",1181779200,,267,4.32
967923,4,6305080224,"This 2 disc set includes some priceless interviews with Alice, all the original band members, his manager and producer, etc. It does in fact cover the history of Alice.

The disc game and jukebox are mostly a recycling of the videos and soundbytes from the documentary. Its good and has some vintage footage in it to be sure.",1162512000,2,325,4.603448275862069
967924,5,6305080224,"I finally recieved my copy of this today. First, the price from Amazon was right. I got my copy for $18(no pun intended) and yes, it is worth it. Most record stores will charge upward of $25.00 for this. The first disc is pretty much the same as the VHS version except with better picture quality and camera angles. There is a cool story about Bruce Springsteen and Alice drinking together, not on the VHS version.
The second disc is lot more in depth than the VHS, featuring interviews with Dennis Dunaway, Mike Bruce, Neal Smith and Dick Wagner.
The comments made by other reviewers about the game are true but if you just keep rolling those dice you eventually get to see the whole thing. The second disc also does feature full-length performances of many Alice Classics most performed with Kane Roberts on guitar. Kane plays the Alice tunes with lots of Steve Vai/Joe Satriani style embellishments. Lots of tapping and dive bombs and even ocasional nods to Yngwie. It took a second to get used to but actually is pretty cool.
The best parts have to be Dennis, Mike and Neal talking about the early days. This is truly a must-have for anyone who has been along time devoted fan. The casual fan may be bored with it as most of the interviews are assuming you already know certain things about the band which the casual fan probably doesn't.
I was definitely pleased with this and pleasantly surprised at how good it is.",1159488000,7,1421,4.576470588235294
967925,4,6305080224,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SINGLE-DISC 1998 DVD VERSION (with Alice wrapped in foil with a flower in his hair on the cover), NOT THE 2-DISC ""SPECIAL EDITION"" 2001 VERSION ***

ALICE COOPER: PRIME CUTS, a comprehensive visual biography of the rock legend, would have to be the best introduction and summary on Alice Cooper that one can buy. And for fans, this version is the better one to buy over the ""Special Edition"" 2-DVD release's version as it has much better picture quality, being presented in its original 4:3 full-screen picture format! (but this one doesn't come with the Special Edition's extra DVD, which is suited for hard-core fans only)

THE DOCUMENTARY...
This informative and entertaining programme covers Alice Cooper's career from the early psychedelic days of the late 60's through the early-to-mid 70's heyday to his commercially successful comeback in 1989.
It has a strong varied selection of songs culled from live footage, rare TV show appearances, and recording studio footage, in between interviews of Alice (circa 1990/1991) as he talks through his amazing history, of what ""the character"" Alice Cooper is and how it came about, of his band mates, and of the songs presented, plus some great rock stories that you'd expect from a rock legend, including being a 'Hollywood Vampire' alongside John Lennon and Keith Moon. Also includes interviews with producer Bob Ezrin and long-time manager Shep Gordon, and kudos from Ozzy Osbourne and Slash.
My only criticisms are that the documentary ignores the majority of Alice in the 80's (of material he released during this commercially-lull period for him that many consider either bizarre, terrible or brilliant material, and of his 2nd more severe hospitalization in 1983 for alcoholism, he's been sober ever since), and that many of the songs featured are only excerpts, not full-length versions. However the excerpts are excusable as Prime Cuts touches on so much within the space of 87 minutes, I think they did a damn good job.

PICTURE QUALITY...
This 1998 US DVD release of Prime Cuts, the first DVD release of the video, is presented in its original 4:3 full-screen format, thus having superior picture quality over the flawed ""Special Edition"" 2-DVD re-release of 2001 which is presented in 'anamorphic-widescreen' (to make full-screen vision into a 'fake' widescreen they cut away the top and bottom of the 4:3 vision to make it 16:9, thereby making the vision look close-up and squashed, and in this case pixelated due to a bad digital transfer job. in my opinion, anamorphic-widescreen is an awful practice of the video industry, worse than 'pan-&-scan'). So if you already have the Special Edition version and you're let down by its bad picture quality then this is the DVD to get! Otherwise, some archive performance footage does look slightly degraded, given the age of most of it, but it's all watchable and very enjoyable.

DVD EXTRAS...
No extras with this release, just a simple stereo transfer plus song menu, which is a pity as it would've been a great opportunity to include full versions of songs which were just featured as excerpts in the programme.

BONUS...
This US version of the documentary does include an extra few minutes of footage, not included in any other country's version except Japan, of Alice talking about his heavy metal resurgence from the mid-80's with the help of Kane Roberts and Kip Winger with brief footage of the Freedom video clip!

THE VERDICT...
5 stars for an awesome documentary, with nice picture quality, but minus 1 star for being such a no-frills release with no extras. So 4 stars for Alice Cooper: Prime Cuts - a perfect place to start for any novice or curious bystander of Alice, and a must for all Cooper fans and any hard rock music fans!",1147219200,3,3775,4.955766192733018
967926,1,6305080224,"Is it possible that I have a crappy copy of this DVD of Alice Cooper's Prime Cuts, or is everyone just looking past this eyesore of video quality?

I could imagine maybe a few poor videos of the earlier songs, but even the later videos (""Poison"", ""Het Stupid"", etc.) look just as crappy as the rest of the DVD.  Even the dialogue of Alice and other people involved with Alice Cooper talking between the songs is of horrid video quality.

Yes, I'm convinced now.  My DVD of this Alice Cooper collection just has to be horribly defective.  Because, there is no way every else can seem to tolerate this collection so favorably and disconcerned, if they are watching what I am watching.  This DVD has to go back.",1135641600,2,708,4.4921875
967927,3,6305080224,"PROS:

- Early and Rare Footage of the Alice Cooper band.

- Clips from mostly all of Alice's shows.

- Interveiws with the old members of the original band.

- Finaly one that tells the truth about why the band split up

- 5.1 sound (sometimes)

- plenty of interviews and storys to listen to

CONS:

- Disc 1 shows the option to choose the AC Game and Photos, but it restarts the menu, and the same thing happens on disc two for all but the game and the photos.

- The game is annoying (I used my chapter selecter and went to each chapter istead of wasting time with the game)

- Pretty much all of the clips are not in there entirity. Some cut out too soon, some start in the middle, some are just snippets, some have talking over them.

- don't be fooled by the name JUKEBOX, it's only the CHAPTER SELECTION.

- Most of the full songs on the bonus disc are very stale and bad versions of the old classics performed supposedly live, but without an audience it has a very un natural sound about it and tho they did a great job with there own albums ""Constrictor"" and ""Raise Your Fist"" the msucley lead guitarist f****d up most of the songs.

- All albums between Flush The Fashion and Trash have no mention. (tho the clips of the old songs are from the constrictor band)

- No mention of Feed My Frankinstien or any of the guest artists on the Trash and HS albums.",1134086400,3,1366,4.183908045977011
967928,3,6305080224,I liked the first disc quite a bit.  What killed it for me was the 2nd disc.  The whole Alice Cooper game is completely annoying.,1127001600,3,129,4.12
967929,5,6305080224,"When I first found out about this release, I thought it was to good to be true. A total of 23 snippets and complete songs from Alice Cooper's pre-platinum days to the early '90's. Starts out with a couple of snippets that should've been a tad longer, like some extremely rarely (if ever) seen before scenes from ""I'm Eighteen"", ""Black Juju"" and ""Levity Ball"". Would sure like to have a copy of these tunes in their entirety. Remember the 1974 cult movie 'Good To See You Again, Alice Cooper' they used to show in drive-ins? There are four (4) songs from that unreleased film here, ""Hello Hooray"", ""Billion Dollar Babies"", ""Sick Things"" (with snake) and ""Dead Babies"". I also recall the ""Elected"" promo clip here on various late night television shows. A couple of his mellow ballads are included as well, ""Only Women Bleed"" and ""How You Gonna See Me Now?"" (from the 'From The Inside' comeback lp). Some clips I haven't seen in years are ""Cold Ethyl"", ""Under My Wheels"", ""Department Of Youth"" and ""School's Out"". You get the idea. I would assume that some of these clips might have come from Alice's own private stash of maybe 8mm or 35mm film. The quality is good. Recommended for any and all Cooper fans.",1101427200,6,1205,4.635514018691588
967930,4,6305080224,"There's a reason it's called ""Prime Cuts"".  The DVD focuses on Alice's best work - his early years.  It gives an overview of Alice's career up ""Trash.""  ""The Last Temptation"" is briefly discussed on the second DVD.
While the song footage may be brief, this 2 DVD set is worth purchasing just for the complete videos of ""Elected"", ""Department of Youth"", ""Poison"", and ""Lost In America"".
The last Alice Cooper album I purchased was ""From the Inside"".  However, the video of ""Lost in America"" (found on the Cooper game) convinced me to give ""The Last Temptation"" a try.
There's some good interviews and concert footage on the second DVD which is the Cooper game.  However, the design of the Cooper game makes it difficult to watch because you have to play the game - you can't just choose ""Play All.""
If you're looking for a concert video, don't buy this DVD.  If you're looking for a documentary focusing on Alice's early years, this DVD is worth the purchase price.",1064620800,9,964,4.674556213017752
967931,2,6305080224,"Prime Cuts is a pretty good DVD if you want to find out about Alice Cooper as in interviews.....but apart from that it is very disappointing as you get hardly any song footage, as for the Jukebox its a waste of time as you start getting into the song and then it cuts off as you only get a taste of the song, which is very frustrating! I was pissed off.
The Coopergame is annoying and the songs you actually get to see in whole form are still made around interviews and the song footage is poor quality.
If you want to see Alice cooper in action do not buy this DVD buy Brutally Live.
I paid $60 Australian Dollars for this DVD as i expected to see all the songs featured as whole songs not clips! I feel ripped off!",1064620800,20,716,4.085106382978723

The band he had back in the 70's, was one of the top progressive bands of the time. Before Rush, Yes, but I guess his ego and the people around him telling him he didn't need the other guys got to him and the music hasn't been the same since. Except when he hired Steve Vai and Joe Satriani back in the 80s.
