8009433,5,B0001AP090,I was in my teens in London during the 50's and 60's when Dixieland Jazz was starting up in England. I was lucky enough to have seen Chris Barber on many occasions performing  live in local clubs and pubs around London. This DVD is very interesting and gives an excellent insight into Chris Barbers own life as a performing artist who spent most of his time travelling from one gig to another. I learned so much from this particular DVD about the music business in general that I never knew before. British trad jazz became very big in the UK and Chris Barber was one of the main artists that introduced this wonderful music to England and Europe. Well worth buying.,1425427200,2,666,4.5041322314049586
8009434,4,B0001AP090,"This DVD reveals the reality of being ""on the road"" as a jazz musician. The quality of music is excellent. Certainly the musicians are world-class. The most telling thing was, however, that life on the road, even in the ""big time,"" is fatiguing and unglamorous. With a bit better production (e.g., camera work and editing), it could readily be bumped up to five stars. For those folks who enjoy jazz, with a touch of Dixieland, this DVD is worth the time and money.",1360886400,2,465,4.614457831325301
