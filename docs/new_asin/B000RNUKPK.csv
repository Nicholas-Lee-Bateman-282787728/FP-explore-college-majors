2869847,5,B000RNUKPK,"There have already been some really excellent reviews of this set, but I'll add a little of my own thinking.
I initially loved the first season of ""Big O"" in large part because of the mystery around Paradigm City.  Like many, I was hoping that season two would answer all of the questions for me.  At the end however, I was left with my jaw on the floor, muttering ""What the...."".  I undertook a lengthy online search for some sort of official explanation, and though I did not find anything ""official"", I did enjoy reading some of the theories other fans had come up with.
So, while at first I was frustrated and a bit disappointed with season two because of the ending, I have come to see it in a different light, and love it.  I loved the mystery of Paradigm, and in many ways it remains a mystery, which is perhaps how it should remain.  What better than something that makes you stretch your own imagination and think?
I am glad to have the entire set, season one and two.  I still love to visit Paradigm City. Roger, R. Dorothy, and Norman are great characters.  Great characters, great mystery, and even a great soundtrack.  I would recommend this to anyone, with the advice to sit back, enjoy the ride, and not expect to have all of their questions answered!",1342310400,,1266,4.45021645021645
2869848,4,B000RNUKPK,"Vol. 2 finishes out this great Anime series.  I recommend you buy Vol. 1 and 2 together and watch the whole series together in a weekend.  That's the only way to watch tv series, in one sitting.

Anyhow...Vol. 2 picks right up where Vol. 1 stops, with Roger fighting those wierd robots coming out of the water.  This season though does have a dramatically different feeling than season 1 did.

Roger is not on top in this season.  Things go at times very badly for him.  Also the mysteries get worse in this season.  To use a comparison, it feels like Lost: The Series did at the end.  Don't let this thwart you though.  It will leave you thinking and wondering what the hell just happened.  For me that's a plus.  I like having to go online and look for analysis's by people.  There are a few good ones, posted by gracious fans online.  They specifically target season 2 mostly, as that's where it gets weird.

I plan on doing one myself.  I believe I have this series figured out and will present my unified explanation of everything when I finally get my website done...someday.

Don't let negative reviews discourage you.  Embrace mystery, embrace shows that make you think and leave you scratching your head.  Better yet grab pen and paper like me and analyze the series by rewatching it until you figure it out.

-Hope I convinced you into watching this great series.  Sorry for my terrible spelling, I went to public school...",1332979200,,1433,4.562992125984252

2869850,5,B000RNUKPK,"The Big O ranks as one of the great classics of anime in my opinion. I'm a Cowboy Bebop/Samurai Champloo flavored anime fan and this one is right down my alley. If you like stylish anime without too much drama, yet nice, deep storylines The Big O is for you.",1262044800,5,258,4.18
2869851,5,B000RNUKPK,"This DVD, obviously, is the final season of Big O. The shipping did a really good job of getting it to my place which is important. It was packaged nice, unlike others I have purchased, and all the DVDs arrived in new condition. This series features the secret of Mr. Rogers as well as the Big O. I would also like to point out that Cartoon Network helped finance this final season because of its popularity. There are also some new characters who make their appearance in it as well as some old characters who get their own Mega Deuces. I would recommend this to anyone who likes anime and giant robot mechs. I would also recommend this to anyone who likes a serious but interesting plot.",1252627200,,689,4.433070866141732

2869854,5,B000RNUKPK,"This is the second part of the complete story of Big O. It is as amazing as collection I. The story becomes more mysterious and a little frightening too. The conversation and the expression of the characters leave something more clearly about the ending of this story and the truth everyone wants to know all along. I kept watching the story until the end on one day. Of course, surprise is included...",1192406400,10,402,4.597222222222222
2869855,5,B000RNUKPK,"Season 1 or Act 13 left off with Roger, Dorothy and Big-O taking on 3 foreign megaduces heading to attack Paradigm-City.  Season 2 picks up where Act 13 left off.  Though the animation was change for season 2 from art decko style (Batman The Animated Series) to CGI animation. Big-O couldn't look any better.  With more colors plus looking more sinister with night battles Cartoon Network did a decent job for season 2.  Anyway in this season more questions then answers from season 1 will be answered.  Roger will encounter some new villains and old villains alike with more megaduces to battle.  Not just Roger who we discover has some secrets however every character will discover he or she destiny.

Plus the mystery of what happen 40 years ago will be slighty answered in the end but pay close attention to the final 6 Acts of this series or you will loose some important vital information about the series. The ending is a bit confusing thanks to Cartoon Network ending the series at 26 Acts which the creator recently quoted that the series suppose to have another 13-26 Acts remaining however it's up to the fans to decided if they want another season or two of the Big-O which I wouldn't mind.  I want answers for what season 2 started only time will tell when.  Overall it's a good series worth watching along with season 1 has Roger Smith The Negotiator will once again must save Paradigm City with his trusty partner Dorothy Wayneright, and The Big-O.",1186963200,12,1463,4.66147859922179

8201549,5,B000RNUKPK,"The ""time-loop"" ending kinda annoyed me. This is the only cartoon that was killed after 12 episodes in Japan, and brought back by popular demand of fans in the US. I loved the cartoon although it was really strange... Recommend it to anyone. Worth having in your collection.",1365724800,,274,4.729166666666667

8201551,5,B000RNUKPK,"The highly anticipated second season of Big O picks up right where we left off last season, and whoever enjoyed it won't be disappointed with this one. The same brilliant writing, great characters, and fascinating enigmas makes this definitely a good buy.
I honestly could not rate this high enough - in my opinion, its not only one of the greatest animated shows I've ever seen, but one of the greatest stories I've ever been told period.

My advice is to buy both seasons, sit back, and prepare to feel the power of Big O!",1348704000,,524,4.515789473684211
