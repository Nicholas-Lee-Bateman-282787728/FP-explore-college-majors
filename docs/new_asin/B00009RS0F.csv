7992932,1,B00009RS0F,"The product was represented as a DVD but it plays only on a computer.  My granddaughters were VERY disappointed when we could not play it on their facilities.  Five year olds do not have computers.  Had I realilzed it was not a DVD, I would not have purchased it.  The product itself is good, but the misrepresentation of the product put a damper on gift -giving.",1356652800,,363,4.454545454545454
