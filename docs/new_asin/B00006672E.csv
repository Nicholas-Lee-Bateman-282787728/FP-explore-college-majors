7961642,3,B00006672E,"In this volume, some interesting stuff happens. Bloodberry plans an elaborate date with Otaru, but she runs off and joins the circus when Lime shows up to accompany them. Cherry finds a lost baby and learns the joys of motherhood. After that, Otaru and the girls sneak Lorelei out of the castle to go out for a picnic. On the outing, Lorelei is kidnapped. The new enemy will surprise you.

I'm loving the direction of the story in J to X, but the production quality of this season is awful. The character designs are ugly, the voice acting is bad, and the details are less impressive than in the 1st season and OVA. Cherry is really the only tolerable character. Most of the time, I can get used to slack animation. In this case, however, it's some of the worst I've ever seen. I recommend renting or watching J to X online before buying it.",1355961600,,841,4.425806451612903
7961643,3,B00006672E,This series was a big disappointment because the voices in English are terrible even though the series said it was the same people who did the voices in the original saber marionette J series. As a fan of this series I just have to say out of all of the voices limes was terrible she was my favorite character in the last series. She acts way too childish and I liked how she used to act but this is ridiculous. The illustrators are not trying as hard at drawing them. I also liked Marine but I found out in J to X that she is not coming back. The story was good but they have try harder with keeping the characters the same. The original series rocked.,1029283200,2,653,4.149606299212598
