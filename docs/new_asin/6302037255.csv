416964,5,6302037255,"This is one of my favorite Vincent Price movies! I was very happy to find it at such a good price! Can't wait to watch it again!!! I don't know anything about ""The Madhouse"", but I'm looking forward to watching it, too.",1353628800,2,219,4.238095238095238
416965,5,6302037255,though  I enjoyed this film I think the last man on earth is Vincent Price's best movie.  This movie was exciting showing Price as a wicked king who finally lost at the end and the movie had some humor to it as well as suspense.,1347753600,,228,4.044444444444444
416966,5,6302037255,"Finally, to see Vincent Price in a grade A horror flick rather than in his usual
second rate movies is a real pleasure.  Edgar Allen Poe's Mask of the Red Death
has the elements to keep the audience captivated by the plot and the first class production values, sets, supporting cast, choreographed scenes, costumes and the beautiful colors and rooms, which round out this movie and bring chills along with the absolute joy of seeing this great actor at his best.  He has never looked more handsome or dapper and yet has never played a more evil role.  Here we see a devoted sadist and satan worshiper who lives a good life as he kills and tortures the peasants.  He relishes their fear and degradation as he partakes of life's pleasures in his beautiful castle.

I was thrilled to see my favorite actor finally getting the quality role he deserved.
The loud and furious thunderstorm raging outside as I watched this made my experience
complete.

The beautiful use of color in the rooms and costumes was a special joy for me.
Horror upon horror builds as the evil Prince Prospero kills, tortures and torments
as a routine daily business.  Poe was a genius of horror as we are continually
shocked by this man's depravity.  This is a must see for those who enjoy old
horror movies.",1335744000,,1278,4.623893805309734
416967,3,6302037255,"This Roger Corman Film Adaption of the Book By Edgar Allen Poe(I have yet to read the book)is Okay good,the only reason to watch it is for Vincent Price,the movie can be over dramatic and boring, The Imagery and this type of stuff  I don't care for.*Spoiler*: ..but I like the Ending and How fitting it was for those who think they can escape death.",1285372800,,349,4.369230769230769
416968,2,6302037255,"The only thing masked by this movie is content/enjoyment.  I always loved Vincent Price but this is one of the worse movies I have ever seen but comes from one of the best short stories.  They really destroyed a good piece of literature with this.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Very little, if anything, other than the title is true to the original literature.  Please don't waste your money.  Building a little fire and watching your money burn would be more enjoyable.",1257984000,,470,4.8125
416969,2,6302037255,"Well, the tape doesn't play well at all, but it does play.  I guess I got what I paid for, as it was extremely cheap.  If I need a good copy, I'll buy the dvd.",1197590400,,159,3.5142857142857142
416970,4,6302037255,"For ""The Masque of the Red Death,"" one of the seven Edgar Allan Poe films that Roger Corman made for American International in the early 1960s, the producer-director had the advantage of Charles Beaumont, one of the scripters from ""The Twilight Zone"" who also wrote ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,"" and science fiction author R. Wright Campbell, doing the adaptation for this 1964 film. What you have to keep in mind is that Poe's originally tale is barely long enough to be considered a short story in the first place, but it is a neat title and it did have a pretty good twist. Beaumont and Campbell come up with an elaborate story to set up how it is that the Red Death attends Prospero's masque. One of the things they did was incorporate ""Hop-Frog,"" another Poe story, but another is to turn Prospero and his sister in worshippers of Satan (reformed, apparently, compared to what we would see from other Hollywood films such as ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the next decade).

When young Francesca (Jane Asher, Paul McCartney's muse in the early 1960s when he was writing songs for her older brother Peter of Peter & Gordon) begs for the lives of her father (Nigel Green) and Gino (David Weston), the young man she loves, Count Prospero (Vincent Price) tells her she can choose who will live and who must die. However, that is just a prelude to the main part of the film where Prospero and his court and holed up in his castle. The Red Death is spreading around the countryside and Prospero needs to find ways to keep himself amused. The result is a series of sadistic games and actions at Prospero's order. Meanwhile, a hooded figure in red comes to pay a visit.

Corman remade ""The Masque of Red Death"" in 1989, but he should not have bothered, because this is the better version. This is arguably the best looking of the Corman films and when you see some of these interior sets you can only marvel at how far Corman has come from the days of making movies quick and dirty for no money (the fact Corman was shooting in Britain for the first time had a lot to do with it as did the fact that they simply used the sets from ""Becket""). Price gets to be relatively restrained, even when he is ordering people garroted or tossing a woman a dagger so she can kill herself, and this one ends with an appropriate whimper. But I think the best performance comes from Skip Martin as Hop Toad, who does a lot with the similarly sadistic subplot of this one.",1117497600,3,2442,4.460850111856823
