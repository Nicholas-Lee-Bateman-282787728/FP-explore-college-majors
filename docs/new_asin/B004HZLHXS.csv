8609638,1,B004HZLHXS,This is a 1 hour poorly done power point. Im sure Dr. Stauffer has a great heart but not one since of production capabilities. It really should mention that it's only pictures and a horrible sound track. Really not worth the money. I hate to be so negative but I strongly suggest not to buy this video...,1308873600,2,304,4.350877192982456
8609639,4,B004HZLHXS,"I don't have any negative criticism of this DVD, just a few comments on why it may be good for some viewers and not exactly what others are looking for. Hopefully it will help in the decision of whether to buy it or not.

We see 57 minutes of pictures or slides of sites all over Israel.

If you went on the trip with these pastors or otherwise follow their ministries, you are probably going to really enjoy the pictures of their tour of Israel. If you went to Israel and didn't take many pictures of your own, this may be exactly what you are looking for. If you are thinking of going to Israel and wondering which sites you want to make sure are included in any tour you take, this may be helpful. I know I did that before I went.

The DVD is different from what I expected when I bought it. The people who made it are in some of the pictures and look like really nice people having a great time in Israel, very much like the trip I took last year. In fact, the entire DVD is a very fast-paced collection of pictures that cover Israel from one end to the other. Gospel music plays in the background with no narration. I enjoyed the music, some of it very much! There's no reason to have the volume up though if you don't enjoy good old-fashioned gospel music or if you just want to watch in silence, because there is no narrative, only music. Occasionally there is a title such as ""Masada"" or ""Qumran"" or ""Sea of Galilee"", etc., to tell you what you are seeing.

Whether this is a good purchase or not depends on what you are looking for. These are excellent pictures of Israel, and if you were on a trip with some of the pastors included or if you follow those pastors, you might really enjoy seeing the tour they presented, even though the pictures go by pretty fast! They had to go fast, of course, in order to include everything, which they did very well. Good coverage. Watching it did make me want to go again, which may be the reason for the DVD in the first place. It's like an Tour of Israel Sampler. I didn't really 'Watch the Bible Come to Life!"" as the title says, because there was no narrative. If I hadn't been there, I wouldn't have known what I was seeing. It also went by so fast, in order to cover everything, and that's a lot of pictures, that there wasn't time to enjoy any of the pictures. I would like to have been able to spend some time with some of the very excellent pictures.

For my own purposes, I went on a different tour and have my own pictures of pretty much everything included here, so it wasn't anything that I didn't already have. I didn't know the people. I liked them immediately because they were friendly and obviously having a good time. I guess what I had wanted when I bought this DVD was more information about those sites so I could remember where I had been and the significance of each, something you don't always have time to appreciate while you are rushing around on a tour. There is just so much to see and never enough time. I already have other DVDs, some from the people whose tour I took, some secular, and some from other trips, which do explain what you are seeing. Again, it also depends on if you are looking for historical information, secular descriptions, etc. We all probably have something different in mind when we are looking for a DVD of Israel.

So my assessment is that this is a very nice DVD, well done, covers most of Israel, moves a little bit too fast to be able to appreciate it as much as I wanted, and lacks narrative of what we are seeing. It just all depends on what the viewer is looking for. If I hadn't taken so many pictures of my own, this might be just what I needed. So, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, but I know that others will find that it is exactly the 5 star DVD they were looking for.",1305417600,,3784,4.226832641770401
