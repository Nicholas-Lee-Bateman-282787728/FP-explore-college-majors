8724867,1,B00A6I77QQ,"Very good film (I had seen it and wanted to own a copy), but the disk itself is damaged in parts and often won't play.  Some parts are simply not available (disk reports ""skipping over damaged parts"".  This happened right out of the box.  It's defective.  I've tried it on computers as well as dvd player.  We also tried cleaning it.  For the money I paid, I expected better quality.  Would not trust this seller again.",1428105600,,419,4.434210526315789
