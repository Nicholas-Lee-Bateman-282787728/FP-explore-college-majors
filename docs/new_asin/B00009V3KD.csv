8436075,5,B00009V3KD,"That's what I'd do if I were the creator of this show.  I wouldn't want it duplicated in any format that would present it in less than its full HDTV, shiny, flashy, juicy dripping wet, smokin' hot original 35mm; but for the sake of reason and money I'd let it go out on Blu-Ray in 1080p (alas, the idiots at FOX broadcast it in only 720p and I didn't get my HD-DVR until after the same idiots canceled the show, so all I've got are low-quality NTSC mpeg files.)-:

Come on JJ!  Put Fastlane out on Blu-Ray for us crazy fans to buy from you... maybe after he's done with Lost.  ;-)",1169769600,3,580,4.151785714285714

8436080,5,B00009V3KD,"The editing was amazing.  I really appreciated the way the film was cut.  You could tell this editor Ron Cobert didn't have a lot of footage to work with but the way things were juxtaposed, he was able to give the film an edge.  It was entertaining.",1138924800,,249,4.25531914893617
