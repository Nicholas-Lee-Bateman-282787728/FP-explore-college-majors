8016385,5,B0001US614,"A great film that I almost never saw. A friend with excellent tastes recommended this to me. It was real, it was harsh, it was brilliant. I would love to see more work from this director, Billy Wirth. If you like a strong independent film... this is the one to see.",1389916800,,265,4.215686274509804
8016386,5,B0001US614,"I have been a HUGE Billy Wirth fan since my early teens when I first saw The Lost Boys. This movie (by Billy Wirth) is amazing. I really bought it just because this is his baby and I wanted, as a fan, to support his efforts. I got more than I was expecting. If MacArthur Park was created and directed by anyone else, I would still think it is an amazing movie. Its makes you smile, laugh, cringe and cry. It is so real. He really captured what he set out to do and I am proud to tell people that Billy Wirth is not only a pretty face but an awesome storyteller. Please watch this movie. It will change the way you look at the people you see on the streets who are ""less fortunate"" than you.",1355529600,,690,4.007246376811594

8016388,5,B0001US614,"Movie arrived within two days,  This is a great indie film, actually one of my favorites It shows the effect of crack cocaine on all segments of society and what the addicts life is really like from day to day.",1245715200,,210,4.25
8016389,5,B0001US614,"At least in my opinion. I saw this amazing film in November of 2001 at the St. Louis Film Festival with 2 friends that ran a fan group for Billy at the time. We saw the movie on Friday evening and the next afternoon and I have to say that it was just as facinating both days. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. Billy did an outstanding job for this being his debut as director. I highly recommend this movie, I think it's worth every cent, though it can be hard to watch at times.",1089590400,3,498,3.99
8016390,5,B0001US614,"I saw this at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival for my birthday. It was there along with Grand Prize winner ""The Believer"" (the first film I saw), ""Scotland, PA"" and ""Julie Johnson"" (a still to be released small masterpiece with Lili Taylor and Courtney Love - yes, that courtney love - in a tale of self-discovery, redirection and newly born lesbianism).
But Billy Wirth's ""MacArthur Park"" has an amazing ensemble led by underrated and underused Thomas Jefferson Byrd (good cineasts will recognize him from several Spike Lee joints, such as ""Clockers"", ""Get on the Bus"", ""He Got Game"" and his best role yet, prior to this film, in the overlooked and oft-misunderstood ""Bamboozled"").
It also has ex SNL alum Ellen Cleghorn (of WB sitcom fame), Lori Petty, Balthazar Getty (from Lynch's ""Lost Highway""), and others.
The story is a disturbing but documentary like account of 48 hours in the life of homeless drug addicts and dealers and the people who float in and out of their orbit in LA's MacArthur Park.
It's an exhilirating, powerful and astonishing directorial debut that began as a documentary and took on actors to dramatize director-writer-actor Wirth's notes, fleshing out reality into a more palatable format (if you like your harsh truths and gritty reality in glossy, well-made fiction form).
Either way you take it, ""MacArthur Park"" is a diamond in the rough, an overlooked gem which is NOT TO BE MISSED!!!",1087689600,11,1416,4.9789029535864975
8016391,4,B0001US614,"I saw this film in April 2001 after waiting over two years for it to get made. On May 18th 2004 the DVD is available for the public and fans to enjoy.
Billy Wirth gives an unflinching look at the underside of life. As a take it or leave it Hip Hop - Rap fan, I was blown away by the soundtrack. I felt the music blended and pulled the movie together, it set the pace and took the viewer on a roller coaster ride.
The ensemble cast was extraordinary,  I was truly amazed to see the performances that Billy got the cast to reveal. It is an intense film and subject matter but with a sense of family, for not giving up on family, or yourself. To see pass the weaknesses that we all share, that with love and faith in each other you can triumph.
The performances of Thomas Jefferson Byrd, Carlton Wilborn, Keno Deary, Ellen Cleghorn were special to me. I look forward to more work from these gifted actors.
I also feel the movie forces the viewer to look inside themselves, to experience another world that many of us don't know and refuse to see. The addict, the homeless, they could all be us. That they do have faces, names, families and souls.",1084838400,6,1143,4.267281105990784
