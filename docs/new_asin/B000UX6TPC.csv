All about sex with friends, and more sex sex and sex! UGH. So many great shows have been either canceled after only a few episodes that have come out and gone in a flash, WHY???

2927096,4,B000UX6TPC,"I like the fact that this season of The Cosby Show came in individual plastic cases (rather than cardboard sleeves), but it's incredibly frustrating that despite there being eight episodes per disk, there's no ""All Play"" button, so you have to select each episode individually, every 20-or-so minutes.",1388016000,,301,5.291666666666667

2927107,5,B000UX6TPC,"My husband and I were newly married back in 1984 when this series first aired. Thursday nights were definitely the ""must see"" TV people talk about primarily due to this show. We rarely missed an episode and when we weren't going to be home, we recorded it on our VCR (remember those?).

Fast forward many years and with a daughter added to our family, we bought these in 2007 and watched the first three seasons again. Earlier this year, we pulled out season 1 and laughed our way through it and are continuing on through the rest of the seasons. My daughter is 17, my husband 55, and I am 50 -- a wide range of ages and yet all of us are laughing from beginning to end and appreciating what a comic genius Bill Cosby is. The cast is incredible, the characters full of quirks and personality, the writing is stupendous.

If you haven't seen these before and are looking for good, clean fun give them a try. If you saw these years ago, give them another go since this is definitely a series that has stood the test of time.",1343520000,,1022,4.317708333333333

We had all the other seasons and could never find this one.  So glad that Amazon had it!",1316649600,,284,4.529411764705882
2927111,5,B000UX6TPC,This was a gift for Christmas. It was sent with plenty of time and apparently was in good shape. I always loved the Cosbys when they were on so I am now starting giving the dvds to my grandchildren,1294704000,,197,4.076923076923077
2927112,4,B000UX6TPC,"I believe season five is my favorite season of the series. I especially love the theme song, and it's the most unique theme song from the series. And there were so many hysterical episodes, I especially love the episode ""A Room With No View"", Vanessa and Rudy have been fighting constantly and they on accidentally damage the roof during a big fight, and as a punishment Cliff decides to make them live in the basement until they learn to get along. And I love ""Day of the Locusts"", this is my favorite episode that includes Sondra, Sabrina Le Beauf plays Sondra and she did a great job in this episode. And there were also some big changes in season five, in ""Out of Brooklyn"" Denise decides she wants a job in Africa as a photographer's assistant, and in ""The Birth"" Sondra finally gives birth to twins. But as we have become accustomed to, there is no bonus material on this set.

The Cosby Show Season five is a fantastic season and even though this is only a decent release from Urban Works it's still a highly recommended buy.",1280620800,,4810,4.628235294117647
2927113,5,B000UX6TPC,"The Cosby Show-who doesn't know it. It stands for fun and entertainment for the whole family. Cosby, witty and smart, solves problems, educates, and makes us laugh. Through all the season Cosby never ran out of jokes and advice, and to me remains one of the greatest entertainers.
Raising a large family with 5 children and parents with demanding jobs, presents Cosby with enough humorous materials to keep any viewers happy and smiling.
A show that can be watched over and over without becoming boring.",1270166400,,503,4.929411764705883
2927114,5,B000UX6TPC,"Following some very awkward moments in the show's fourth season The Cosby Show begins to go more for it's traditional brand of love and humor in this season. The incredibly funny dance routine,the first and only to feature the entire cast dancing together sets the tone in a way. In the beginning of the season we have a double transition;Theo is off to collage and Denise is back having of course dropped out of Hillman. Only shown mildly in The Cosby Show during her original stint with th cast this is the first showing in the show of the ""flakey Denise"" as seen in the first season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Different-World/dp/B0009HBPEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Different World</a>. Here we're introduced to a character with no firm collage experience who suddenly has a ""game plan"" to only work in either the fasion design or music industry. She jumps from job to job aimlessly and...surprisingly her usually education obsessed parents mostly laugh it off. Four episodes into the season she's gone again,off to Africa to ""find herself"" and.....well she'll return to the cast a year later but that's the story of another season. Of course only a couple episodes after that Cliff and Clair become first time grandparents as Sondra gives birth to twins Winnie and Nelson and this new addition to the brood really brings back some of the family feeling that could've easily disappeared as the older Huxtable kids were coming and going. ""How Do You Get To Carnegie Hall?"" is another great show featuring Vanessa as a member of the shopping mall girl group The Lipsticks,taking lessons from a voice teacher played by Betty Carter and blowing it all when she performs an all too revealing routine for her folks,complete with tissue paper in the midrift. ""Theo's Woman"" is one of my favorites this season where Theo,lamenting his breakup with steady girlfriend Justine over a misunderstanding involving an acting student winds up shouting the blues with the famous ""JUSTINE JUSTINE"" bit-one of my all time favorite Cosby Show moments. Sammy Davis,Placido Domingo,Debbie Allen,Naomi Campbell and future US presidential candidate Bill Bradley all make memorable guest appearances this season as well. Another favorite of mine is ""Mrs. Huxtable Goes To Kindergarden"",a pointed and very comical episode wherein Clair is asked to appear on an early morning political panel show-only to find she's there as part of an unspoken racial quoata. It's not only a vital story about injuctices common especially to African American woman-Clair's style,beauty and intelligence notwishstanding and how sometimes those things don't wind up mattering in the sceme of things the way they should. The season finale of the show ""57 Variaties"" also deals comically with racial matters as the Huxtables are put in the possition of having to guess the cultural makeup of a racially ambiguous teacher. I know from my experience with others dealing with me: it's not nearly as easy as one might think. This season overall gains back a lot of the warmth and humor that was a bit stilted in the previous season and,sadly enough was the final Cosby Show season that placed at the top possition in the ratings. Even so there'd be a lot more great things to come from the Huxtable family.",1269388800,,3314,5.161710037174721
2927115,5,B000UX6TPC,"Even though the Cosby Show is around 20 years old, it's still one of the best sit-coms ever. Bill Cosby is hilarious - a comic genius. His reactions to events are so spontaneous and creative. I haven't seen another comic quite like him. Best of all, the show's plots are both family-friendly and funny. Unlike modern sit-coms, the characters don't curse and talk about sex every other scene. Rather the episodes are centered around family dramas that are realistic but always resolved well. The cast includes everybody from Phylicia Rashad as the tough and very intelligent Mrs. Huxtable, to the young and adorable Rudy. This makes the show accessible to a wide range of audiences. I am glad these finally came out on DVD. I hope one day to share this treasure with my children.",1263168000,,778,4.770370370370371

2927120,5,B000UX6TPC,"Hee we are at the fifth Cosby Show go-round.  And, if the viewing audience thought things changed the year before, this season brought changes - to the changes.  Lisa Bonet has left the cast of A Different World, and her character, Denise Huxtable struggles with dead end jobs and ends up hopping a plane to Africa as a photographer's assistant.  (All this to allow her to give birth to her daugher with Lenny Kravitz, Zoe below the radar.)  Also, Theo starts his college degree at NYU but neglects to turn in his dorm fee.

But, why did I mention that first?  The biggest change of all is the arrival of the next generation.  At the season's opening, Sondra is nine months pregnant.  Not with one child, as everyone thought, but with TWINS, Winnie and Nelson.  (Only Sondra, Elvin and their doctor know this one piece of information prior to the birth.)  Those two babies bring plenty of fun, drama and surrealistic comedy to the 5th season of The Cosby Show.

[Also of note is the re-appearance of Clarice Taylor as Grandma Anna Huxtable; she didn't appear once in Season 4, even though we see plenty of Earl Hyman as Grandpa Russell.]",1215648000,,1137,4.606965174129353
2927121,4,B000UX6TPC,"Why I gave my review this title? Cause honestly I don't remember seing it depressingly funny the first time around. & I mean when it first came out & when I wtached the rerun too.
When i bought the dvd set & watched episode by episode,my GOD it was depressing,probably because of the fact that I was depress I manage to identify myself with Lisa Bonet's character. Or the pains of growing up & dealing with it in Vanessa & Rudy's case. Or the fact that Cliff & Clair were counting down how many kids were left in thw house & many were out. Or the fact that Sondra & Elvin dropped college to open a wilderness business.
But honestly the whole season I found it depressing but it never lost that COSBY SHOW touch! So it was funny & family oriented as usual.",1206576000,,755,4.25

This first one simply lists all of the eppisodes from each season and has a list of all the cast of regulars to even semi regulars, really if they appear as the same charicter more than 3 times they're in the list; [...]
This second link not only list all of the eppisodes but gives a short description of each one; [...]
I can't wait for these to come out they contain some of my favorite episodes, three of them being the two birth episodes in season five and ""I'm in with the in crowd"" from season six, for those of you who don't recognize this one by it's title it's the one where Vanessa gets drunk. My all time favorite episode was in season two it's titled ""Theo's Holiday"" and it's when the family turns the Huxtable house into the ""real world"" on mister Theo. One more week, two including shipping and I'll be a happy camper. Maybe at this rate seasons 7 and 8 will be out around the first of the year.",1193616000,,1083,4.018518518518518

2927131,5,B000UX6TPC,"Wow,I don't believe this! On June 5,First Look Entertainment put out seasons 3 and 4 of NBC's The Cosby Show and on November 6,we TCS fans will once again double our pleasure with the releases of seasons 5 and 6. I'd assume the discs will be housed singly in plastic cases like the season 3 and 4 sets. In 1988,TCS made its syndication debut on various independent stations all over America and other countries. Comedian Bill Cosby,the series' star and co-creator,promoted the syndication debut in magazine/newspaper advertisement and television commercial. He said,""We'll be coming to your house five nights a week instead of just one. And if that's not enough,you should consider moving in with us."". The first station I remember syndicating TCS was Seacaucus,New Jersey-based WWOR(I had that station in my native New Jersey). WWOR probably still airs TCS today. Around summer 1988,writers for many network series went on strike until that September,the latest. So on October 6,1988,season 5 premiered with the episode TOGETHER AGAIN AND AGAIN. We see recent high school graduate Theodore Aloysius ""Theo"" Huxtable(Malcolm Jamal Warner) entering New York University with his girlfriend Justine(the late Michelle Thomas,recurringly). But Theo hasn't,at least not yet,left the Huxtable nest. We also see Vanessa(Tempest Bledsoe) and her friends Janet and Kara,forming a vocal group called The Lipsticks and entering a talent contest. However,their busty appearances and sexy movements shock Vanessa's mother Clair(Phylicia Rashad). Cliff(Cosby),I must admit,was a tadbit shocked himself. Fifteen-year-old Vanessa also breaks curfew by staying out ridiculously late with a boyfriend(she was just in his car with him). As for The Lipsticks,Rudy(Keshia Knight Pulliam) thought they were ""hot""! Theo and two buddies throw a party in the Huxtable home in Cliff's and Clair's absence intended for only six people,Theo,his buddies and their girlfriends. Before they knew it,there were about 200 people at the party,wrecking havoc. Cliff and Clair returned home from an overnight getaway and were flabbergasted by the mess left made by those responsible. Cliff ""sends away"" Theo. Theo also requests permission from Cliff and Clair for a summer trip to Cairo(this is the season finale). Lisa Bonet as Denise Huxtable,the second of Cliff's and Clair's five children,continues to occasionally appear. She is working various jobs while still studying at Hillman College. At this time,Bonet was written out,at least as a regular,of the TCS spinoff A DIFFERENT WORLD. The most joyous moment of all this season,first aired November 10,1988,is when Cliff and Clair become first-time grandparents of twins Winnie and Nelson Tibidaux,born unto Sondra(Sabrina LeBeauf) and her husband Elvin(Geoffrey Owens). The other episodes are great. In the opening montage,there are no personal scenes. The names of the cast rapidly appear as the actors themselves. They are dressed in tropical-themed wardrobes,dancing barefoot on a veranda in a tropical setting. A symphony orchestra plays the theme this season. But in the closing montage,the theme is a little different,for it contains a style that is more like jazz. Rudy,at this time,is age 9,as is KKP. She's still sweet and lovable but no longer cute. Theo is now a man,since he had just turned 18 as did MJW. Also we'll see Clair celebrating her 46th birthday. She and Cliff indulge in strawberry shortcake. This is just another one of their romantic moments. In reality,Rashad was age 40. Guest star opera singer Placido Domingo even sings to Clair in that episode. Yes,even the cast can get moral support from real-life family members. Rashad's sister Debbie Allen,late of NBC's FAME,guest-starred as an aerobics instructor for a class Clair is taking. Clair was trying to lose some weight to fit an old dress again that she has and loves. Allen subsequently worked for NBC,directing some episodes of THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR. She directed a few FAMILY TIES episodes also. John Amos,late of CBS's GOOD TIMES,guest-starred as Cliff's physician. For the fourth time,TCS finished at #1 this season. By this time,I believe TCS was at least nominated for a multitude of Emmys.",1188259200,,4203,5.379362670713202
