6208183,2,B00HT69SAG,"This is to let others know that this isn't a full season volume, but a partial season. each of the volumes of the omniverse series up to now have been 10 episode sets that are supposedly seasons, which were mixed causing confusion to any collector trying to arrange by seasons. But this volume and the next take the cake as this isn't even a half of a season, as vol. 3 contains the 1st episode for season 4, while this contains season 3's final episode, as well as season 4-4, 4-7 through 4-9. Instead of either releasing a subsequent volume for the rest of season 4, they're releasing a partial season 5 for the next volume. the episodes missing from season 4 in any current volumes are: 4-2 Food Around the Corner, 4-3 O' Mother Where Art Thou, 4-5 Mud is thicker than Water(omniverse premier of Lucy), 4-6  OTTO Motives, and the season finale: Max's Monster. If they do end up releasing this, it'll be in part volume 6, or will that end up in limbo. or worse, mixed in as part of the next volume, while messing up the ""season 5"" set.",1401580800,7,1037,4.373056994818653

6208185,5,B00HT69SAG,"Okay, I'm old enough to be Ben's grandpa. So what? The simple fact is all of the series have their own charms and are watchable and a great deal of fun. True, Gwen and Kevin only make the occasional appearances in the series, but Ben's new partner Rook is a lot of fun. This one with Albedo trying still to get to his original Galvan form comes in several shows from the series, and they are a lot of fun. I admit, I miss Man Of Action's hands in the show, but they laid down a good template to follow, and these sows do them justice. The character designs took a little getting used to, but once I got past that, I had a good time. The writing is still excellent, the animation is fine for TV, You will enjoy.",1400889600,4,710,4.078571428571428

8635666,3,B00HT69SAG,"ok this is a major disappointment, I love this series I love this season, but why oh why were there only half the number of episodes than previous volumes, this wouldn't be a problem if the next volume came out with the next batch of episodes, but nope waited for months and it's galactic monsters that is out next, again that would be fine if the other eps were apart of the bonus.

I don't know what's going on but someone contact marketing and tell them they are screwing up big time, your being cruel to the fans who love the show, and want to see the series on dvd",1411603200,3,569,4.172727272727273
