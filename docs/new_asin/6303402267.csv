7845824,4,6303402267,"This video features a solid storyline with plenty of action and twists and turns that should appeal to both girls and boys--a young girl who is the descendent of a powerful priestess is drawn into a magical realm where she  becomes embroiled in a fight to save it--with animation of pretty good  quality.
One of the things that really appealed to me was the design of  the World in the Clouds... it was a fascinating ""what if Leonardo  DaVinchi's more offbeat creations actually worked""/magic steam-punk  kind of place.
I suspect that if I had more extensive knowledge of  Japanese culture and history that some aspects of this video would seem  even more fascinating to me, perhaps even prompting a Five Star rating.",945648000,,717,4.827868852459017
