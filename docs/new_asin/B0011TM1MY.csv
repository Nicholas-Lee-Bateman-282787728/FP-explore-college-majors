8294416,2,B0011TM1MY,"This video covers a very strange set of locations. Places like the Drakensberg Mountains are ignored and Durban, Kimberly, the Wild Coast and the Free State are not even mentioned.
The commentary is terrible. I feel like the script was written by someone who read about the locations in a book, and didn't know what else to say. The narrator does his best to make it lively, but a lot of the ""facts"" are incorrect or only partially true.
Overall, skip this one. The video is dated, the content less than useful, and the commentary will put you to sleep.",1453939200,,553,4.54
8294417,4,B0011TM1MY,"I liked it a lot, sure it's dated but the film is nice quality & it really covers a lot, what a lovely place I hope it stays that way one day I would love to visit.",1420329600,,164,3.4594594594594597
