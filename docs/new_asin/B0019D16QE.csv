I am so PROUD OF THESE MEN. GOD BLESS YOU ALL who had the courage to speak your feelings, ground yourself in reason, apply human sensibility, practice Virtue regardless of the surroundings! I have shared the streaming link with scads of people, bought the DVD and shared it, and will continue to promote this.  I think THIS SHOULD BE SHOWN IN EVERY HIGH SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY.
GREAT JOB MR. DAVID WILSON!  p.s.  I loved your Auntie who tried to get you to sing!  What a PIP! Can't wait to meet you all ""on the other side of life"" - Blessings, healing, Peace of Jesus Christ be upon you and in you!! Love, Debby",1503446400,,641,4.406779661016949

8273543,5,B0019D16QE,"Both David Wilsons were sensitive, likeable and interesting people. It was brave of them to meet and discuss difficult issues.",1392681600,,126,5.35
8273544,5,B0019D16QE,Inspiring! A treat for family viewing. It will stimulate truly meaningful family discussion. A very useful complement to Canada or US middle-school or highschool history curriculum.,1389139200,,181,6.0
8273545,5,B0019D16QE,"There are so many things that stood out in this film that are both surprising and thought-provoking. This was not the kind of film I expected it to be, and it was better than I hoped it would be. Sometimes it doesn't take all the ""extras"" that go into producing a film to deliver a good picture.",1385164800,,295,4.192982456140351
8273546,4,B0019D16QE,I enjoyed watching this film with my family and the converstations that sparked after.  I appreciate the candid thoughts shared by the creator and watching his opinions about a man he'd never met before change once they spent time together.,1374710400,,240,5.0
8273547,5,B0019D16QE,This is an excellent video about bridging a century and one-half of time to connect two races in harmony and equality where 150 years ago one of the parties was in servitude to the other.  I have just had a similar experience where I met a fine man whose great-great grandfather was once a slave on my great-great grandfather's plantation in the South.  This film made me appreciate my new friend who though he may not be a cousin is definitely my brother.  I salute the film maker and both Mr. Wilsons for their openness and courage to participate in this film.,1252886400,2,562,4.490196078431373
8273548,5,B0019D16QE,"I saw this first on MSNBC, in fact I taped it...advertisements and all but when I saw I could get it on DVD I immediately ordered it.  It is well done, it tells the story of a white man and a black man who have the same name.  The white man's family owned the black man's family as slaves.  This story tells how we can become ""one nation"" united, not divided.  I urge everyone to see it and especially people with school age children so they'll get the idea.  Also, it is never boring or preachy.",1215561600,3,496,4.125
8273549,5,B0019D16QE,"I have no problem with the seller. It is just a strange story. I found out more about the Black David Wilson's relationship with the White David Wilson than his relation with his Ancestral cousins in Africa.

He never was shown talking to them and making physical contact.

I hug everyone I meet , when I  am introduced to properly, when I go back home to the Motherland. I love them! I could care less, whos relatives owned my relatives. Enslavement was not a choice! It was a tragedy and an injustice.

My Ancestors would be angry with me, if I obsessed on the matter, in such a way!

I have no hatred for the decendants of our kidnappers and terrorizers but I don't ever want to meet them !

It was just something that I felt was a very edited documentary.

Seems like who ever had the money to produce it, leaned more to I forgive y'all. I hope we can stay friends. Nothing else was important.

Very dissapointing story line. I would not ask my friends to buy it.

They would be upset with me, if I had them pay good money for such a pathetically protrayed story.(very sad)",1215475200,2,1077,4.318407960199005
