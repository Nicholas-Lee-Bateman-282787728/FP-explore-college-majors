8144218,5,B000I6AHOK,"I personally enjoyed Joyce Becker ""Teaches You Landscape Quilting"" DVD. I am new to collage and Landscape quilting .
I have a Sewing with Nancy (Zieman) and Nancy Sewell Book and DVD that I have found helpful with creating trees.
I also have several of Joyce Becker's books, but I need more visual help so I ordered her DVD and I'm glad I did. She shows you step by step how to quickly create a landscape scene, then she goes over different uses for Tulle, spray adhesive, fabric paints, markers, embellishments, etc. explaining useful information on each. (There is a short demo on You tube that may be helpful)
She also shares some very easy realistic element tricks.  My favorite is creating mountain and tree reflections. I was amazed at how easy it was!
I found this DVD full of informative and useful tips. Her method is Simple and Easy to understand. She answered the questions I had and I am even more excited about my new hobby!!",1298678400,3,938,4.583333333333333
8144219,4,B000I6AHOK,"Joyce Becker has created a well organized guide to creating a landscape quilt.  Scripted step-by-step directions with visual demonstrations thoughout, Joyce is easy to understand and follow.  If there is any negative to the script, it is that it tells us too many details, but then again those who are experienced quilters would need these details.  As a beginning quilter I was pleased with the instructions and am anxious to try to create my very own landscape quilt.",1220313600,3,469,4.987179487179487
8144220,1,B000I6AHOK,"I have Joyce Beckers' first book on Landscape quilting and really enjoyed the book.  Therefore, I was waiting with anticipation for my new DVD.  Boy, was I disappointed.  First, she was extremely boring on the DVD.  I have no idea what Joyce is like in a real situation but the video was excruciatingly boring.  But it even gets worse.  In my opinion too many topics were covered so only a cursory overview was done.  Therefore, one couldn't really learn anything because it wasn't covered enough.... and I have been a quilter for over 20 years.  I feel that this venue was such an opportunity for a great quilter/teacher to share her knowledge with others but would suggest that Joyce goes back to the drawing board to review the video and see what she could do to capture interest and to focus on a few things and TEACH THEM.",1162166400,35,827,4.54054054054054
