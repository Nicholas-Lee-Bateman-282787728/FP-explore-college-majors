2654375,5,B000ICL3M4,It is a new version of the first Lassie's film. It gives a different focus of the classical relation between the child and his dog. The locations are wonderful and the dog is as nice as the first one.,1167868800,8,200,4.153846153846154
2654376,4,B000ICL3M4,"The world's most famous dog comes back with more faithful story to the Eric Knight's original book. This Irish-UK-French production sets its plot in war-time Yorkshire, where a poverty-stricken family is forced to sell their beloved collie Lassie to a wealthy nobleman who is traveling to Scotland. You already know the rest of the story. Yes, Lassie comes back, no matter what it takes.

The story is simple, and should be so, but the film adds several episodes to it. Lassie's close encounter with Nessie is suggested (I'm not kidding), and there is one hilarious scene about Lassie ""testifying in court,"" which is my favorite part. Perhaps without these episodes the film would have worked as old-fashioned family picture, but anyway you would find them amusing. And like old-fashioned family picture, the traits of each character are slightly exaggerated. Bad characters are really bad, theatrical `bad' that is begging to be despised by the audiences.

Remember, Lassie's adventures are not all merry ones. One tragic event happens during Lassie's long journey to the home, and one death is included in it. I for one didn't like that part. But if you say death happens in our life, I don't disagree.

The newest film does not have the California sun; the weather in Yorkshire and Scotland sometimes looks gloomy, but the landscapes of the places are all beautiful.

Coal miner's family, original owner of Lassie, is played by John Lynch, Samantha Morton and Jonathan Mason. Peter O'Tool is effectively cast as the headstrong Duke, and newcomer Hester Odgers (who is to play Helen Burns in BBC's `Jane Eyre') is adorable Priscilla. Adults, especially fans of these UK actors would be amused to find the cameos from Kelly McDonald, Robert Hardy (Cornelius Fudge of `Harry Potter' series) and many others.

So here's my advice. Enjoy this film as totally different work from TV series.

Trivia: You can see ""Hey Hey"" the `direct descendent' of original Lassie (9th generation) in the scene where the film's Lassie (real name Mason) is brought to the Duke's estate in Scotland. In this film Lassie meets in Scotland another collie Hey Hey who lives actually in America, and the filmmakers made their `meeting' scene using CGI with Hey Hey's image shot in USA.",1167350400,15,2260,4.997340425531915
2654377,5,B000ICL3M4,"Boy would I like to have been a fly on the wall when the details of this production were hammered out!  The dogs who do most of the work in this film are quite lovely, as is the film itself, but where's Lassie?  Oh, right, that's him in the stable for 15 seconds - a cameo as Lassie's ""intended.""  How much money changed hands so that poor old collie could lie on the straw in front of the cameras and the people who made this film could use the magical name, Lassie?  This film evidently tanked in the theatres - too bad, it deserved the critical praise it received and I hope it sells a zillion copies as a DVD.

  Well, whatever they had to do, I'm glad they did.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film - maybe not quite as much as the original, but that would be asking a lot.  Beautifully filmed in fine locations, good sets, art direction, acting (both human & canine), and a fairly faithful retelling of the book.  The period was well depicted, and the characters never mawkish.  I especially enjoyed Peter Dinklage and his Border Terrier sidekick.  Easily worth the price of admission, and don't forget your hankie - you'll need it!",1167264000,6,1132,4.389423076923077
2654378,5,B000ICL3M4,"While Lassie is first and foremost a children's story, it is also, like other classic literature that had been turned into film, a period piece. And, I dare say that as time goes by, this instalment of Lassie will prove itself to be more and more a period film. As such, my standard for this film is that its approach must have historical elements in it, without wandering away too far from the original spirit of a children's tale. It must also provide lessons and certain knowledge that young minds can easily digest. I think Lassie 2006 has succeeded very well in these two areas. The production values are very consistent and comfortable with its time setting in that it is emphasized (while not being too elaborate.) This is not a second rate film where the settings are limited and economized. In any period film, ""authenticity"" is very crucial because it spells the film's success or failure to bring in the audience to the story. While Lassie's story and adventures in her trek back are in themselves sufficient enough to maintain interest, the makers of the film did not lax in raising the bar for its production values. The beautiful photography and English settings are testaments to the labor of love that went through in making this film. I really can't find any cause of blame that the film took an easier way out in any of the scenes.

As for the lessons to be had in this gorgeous film, parents must be advised that this movie is not your common fairy tale. While it is a simple story of a very loyal collie trying to get back to her master against all odds, it also recounts the story with a historical perspective, especially with the possibility of war looming ahead in the horizon. Children will also see animal maltreatments by humans who live in a time when society wasn't ""enlightened"" enough.

And yet, parents mustn't be deterred in showing this film to kids. The reason for this review is to help you get prepared. There is great opportunity for discussion on many subjects like animal rights, geography, history, period film and even the English class system (and how this is different from other ways of life. For starters, what on earth is a Duke? Is it just a title with nothing behind it?) Anyway, I don't think any story can be appreciated at all if it is too sanitized.

One of the things that make this movie work is its cast ensemble of veteran actors and also the younger ones. Peter O'Toole, while now of ripe old age, is in top form as the cranky Duke of Rudling. Other famous actors include Robert Hardy who has a cameo as judge in the most hilarious scene of the movie. Edward Fox also appears as a scientist on to the Loch Ness monster research (which by the way is portrayed as a whale in this film, if my eyes did not fool me....) Peter Dinklage is very noteworthy as a travelling gypsy with a puppet roadshow. The children are also appealling and talented.

All in all, this is one very fine family entertainment, highly recommended and highly rewatchable. Nearly on par with the beautiful ""The Secret Garden 1994,"" with a guarantee of more-than-pleasant viewing for all ages. Most of Lassie's adventure may appear short and hurried to older audiences, but this will just be right for the short attention span of the young ones. Viewers might also want to turn on the subtitles as some of the dialogues have a heavy Yorkshire accent.

Dec. 31, 2006: I should have written this earlier but just didn't take the time. Mr. T. Nakajima (the reviewer two steps above me) is correct in writing that the characters are either good or evil, in other words, stereotyped. I think one of the main reasons we despise stereotyping in characters is that it fails to show that these people who inhabit a film also have a human side. For many, showing the human side of characters (as opposed to showing them as either absolutely good or absolutely bad) is more truthful and acceptable, in that in reality, no one is really ever truly as good as God or evil as the devil. However, it must also be noted that stereotyping in any fictional work has been around for millennias. It is actually part of the stuff that makes fairy tales and legends. It is this style of fiction that gives good and evil the sharp constrast so that people can maybe learn more from the good, and also to avoid any shady points in between.

I do not agree with overly stereotyping any fictional character in any fictional work. I believe that good people also have bad sides and that bad people can change. Having said this, ""Lassie"" does have some stereotyped characters, but to say that it doesn't have a human side will also be amiss.",1165881600,10,4640,4.577617328519856
2654379,5,B000ICL3M4,"The whole family should enjoy this wonderful retelling of the familiar Lassie tale.  Set in pre-WWII England and Scotland, the movie is beautifully filmed, lushly scored, and excellently acted.  The dog herself is beautiful and there are times her expressions are amazing.  Jonathan Mason as little Joe is heartbreaking; Samantha Morton shines as Joe's mother and John Lynch is fine as the dad who is forced to sell the collie for food money.  Peter O'Toole chews up the scenery as the Duke and is marvelous; Peter Dinklage in too brief a role is mesmerizing as the dwarf who befriends Lassie.

A few hankies might be necessary but the happy ending is warmly received.  A fine family film.",1165104000,9,689,4.846153846153846
2654380,2,B000ICL3M4,"I admit that the photography and beauty of this film by far surpasses the original Lassie Come Home. This is to be expected though considering the times in which the two movies were produced. In the new movie the story line very loosely follows the book, leaving out crucial scenes. And what was up with the Lock Ness Monster?! That scene made absolutely no sense.  Why did this movie change the ending? It should have stuck with the story and ending in the book and a better acting Lassie. They even left out the famous swimming across the river scene...the scene that made Pal, the first Lassie, a star.

If all you want is lovely scenery then this is a movie for you. But for the rest of you die hard Lassie fans, stick with the book and the original movie. Trust me, you will be dissapointed with all the changes made.",1163980800,4,822,4.401315789473684
2654381,5,B000ICL3M4,"By far, this movie is much, much better in every way possible than the 1943 movie and the 1994 movie.  Those films were fine, but this particular version is in a class by itself.  The acting, the photography, the dialogue, the plot, and the dog.  I totally agree with what one other reviewer mentioned:  that on the box, it says that ""this is one of the best children's movies in years.""  It is NOT just a movie for children.  It is a movie for all of us, young and old. Be prepared to shed some tears. It is a wonderful movie.  Better than best.  I loved it.  I saw it in the movie theater a few months ago and now bought the DVD. The distributors did a poor distribution job.  It was not heavily promoted or seen in a multitude of theaters. That was grossly incorrect thinking.  This is a movie that can be viewed again and again.  Superb!",1163721600,44,841,4.220125786163522
2654382,5,B000ICL3M4,"I rented this today and if you've seen the first movie or read the book, then you'll have a general idea of what's going to happen next.  The film makers did a good job of elaborating on several parts, and you grow to understand both the little boy's perspective as well as the little girl.  Kids will like this for a lot of dog scenes, as well as a very cute scene at the end, but be warned.  Without spoiling things, there is a dog death, well done but still a death.  I would recommend this to any fan of the films or collie fans in general, I happen to have a merle blue collie, so a lot of Lassie's expressions were familiar.",1163462400,13,630,4.097560975609756
2654383,5,B000ICL3M4,"I had low expectations for this film with all the poorly done animal movies, but this one is something else. It's one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen! This Lassie is a remake of the original Lassie Come Home based on the book by Eric Knight. Well acted, well shot and well written, for me it is the best Lassie film ever. It tells the story of a dog who travels hundreds of miles to find her young master over some of the most inhospitable and visually stunning landscape in Great Britain. I highly recommend it whether you are a Lassie fan or not. It stands alone as a heart wrenching story about determination, loyalty, family, courage and love.

For Parents: The cover on the American release of the DVD is deceptive for Lassie is not a ""children's"" movie. The tone is somewhat dark throughout and children under seven or eight may be upset by some of the peril Lassie faces. Also the plot lines involving the human characters are detailed and may leave younger children yawning or confused.

Enjoy!",1163462400,14,1015,4.540983606557377

Tried again to watch it today.  My 5 1/2 year old grandson was so bored that he got up and left the room.  I've tried to watch it once or twice before and was just as bored, turning it off.

The father is an unrelenting jerk (ok, if you must give away the dog  that your son loves more than life itself because you're poor, at least be nice to the dog, show some compassion as you dump it off to another obvious creep) - that 's just one issue I had with the film. Are we supposed to feel sorry for the father? If so, I didn't feel an ounce of pity for him losing his job, I just wanted his wife to leave him, take the kid and grab the dog. The other issue was the main antagonist, he was so over the top and mean it was too much. Ok I get it, you don't want the dog to run away but do you have to threaten it? Really? I'm a major animal lover and I know there are sickos out there but these characters did not feel real to me at all. And probably fifteen minutes into the film, the dog playing Lassie crawls under a fence and it was brutal watching it. He had to contort his body and could easily have hurt him/herself so clearly the filmmakers were more interested in getting the shot than in the dogs safety.

2654464,5,B000ICL3M4,I absolutely loved this version of an old favorite. Some reviewers found the movie to be inappropriate for children. I respectfully disagree.

Also to parents reviewing about it being 'inappropriate"" it IS rated PG, not G. It is not that bad either, I've seen far worse. Like Watership Down for example. There really isn't anything wrong with this movie that could upset your kids.

It's very tame and doesn't have a whole ton of swearing and it doesn't have any sexual references like many CARTOONS parents let their kids watch today have. There is only one scene that can be considered upsetting where a little dog dies, but it is a drama. Not a comedy.

There was death in ALOT of the old Lassie Classics so its something you should expect. I say this movie is just fine for kids and adults. It's got a great plot, even a little cute humor and of course, Lassie is always incredible!

I will just add one problem I had with it. I didn't like the actor for Joe. Very bad actor and not experienced. I couldn't make out most of what he said and he had this weird issue where he never opened his eyes entirely. Was he not used to the camera lights or something? Aside from that though, it's a very good family drama.",1430006400,,1274,4.317991631799163

O'Toole portrayed an old Fuddy-Duddy who surprises us with his extremely humane behavior, great sense of humor, and excellent wisdom as pertains to Lassie's big brother, the boy.  No wonder his granddaughter loved him so much.  As with Lassie, many deals in life require a whole package if you want one aspect of the package.  In this case, in order to have Lassie, Grandpa had to buy her family as well.  So nice to get rid of that canine child abuser!",1420588800,,702,4.480314960629921

2654543,5,B000ICL3M4,"Great acting. The main characters were excellent. Kudo's to Mr. O'Toole, STILL able to pull it off! Great plot. Photography that makes you feel refreshed. Realistic situations with loss and pain and poverty. Don't let that stop you and young children from watching.  The beauty outweighs the sadness.

Children while needing to be protected from adult situations, need also to be exposed to situations that cause them to have empathy and awareness of other people's needs and problems. Without which education, we become a heartless, selfish society.

This movie, captures you. It pulls your heart wider open. It asks you to be a child again and feel that pure love, that dogs and children feel.

IF you wanted, this film could help many conversations you may have to have with your children, or even with yourself when sad things happen to us. A pet's loss, bullying, mean teachers, loss of job...and more.  Sometimes these conversations are hard to start, hard to know what to say in them, and harder to help anyone feel better. This film can act as a cathartic and let your tears flow if needed.

This story would keep a child's or an adult's attention from beginning to end. The end doesn't drop you without coming to a conclusion like many films now do. You don't feel like you have wasted your time after you watch this. You feel like you have taken a breath and are ready to go again.",1404518400,,1391,4.680327868852459

No Timmy, no farm, no well; those are all American contraptions. Populated by a top-drawer cast, this version returns to the original tale and does so beautifully. This is the story of a loyal Collie separated from her boy, who escapes and makes her way back home through stunning scenery, adventures and scenery.

The DVD extra that details the making of the film is as wonderful as the film. It shows how an army of animal actors was wrangled for the fox hunt scene, and how one dog performed the entire role of Lassie -- usually such roles require numerous animal actors each trained to perform a limited number of tricks and stunts.

This is a wonderful film for all ages, beautifully crafted and memorable. I have purchased five DVDs of LASSIE so far, they keep leaving my possession and ending up in the homes of friends who watch it again and again.",1393891200,2,1042,4.596774193548387
2654552,5,B000ICL3M4,"Couldn't be a simpler story, nor any more beautiful and tearful. Some sad tears, then tears of joy at the beauty of it all including its emotions. All amid the majesty of an English manor.  Ragged failed coal mine. Opulence versus disappointment of laid-off miners. Poverty in a sooty coal town. Sad scary beginnings and finally...

All woven together a story more a British stage melodrama, elegant and staid all at once. Did I say simple? Anything but. Showing simplicity can be complex, beautiful. Not like the USA TV series, which was fine. But this multi-level drama will thrill and drain you and then turn it all around and make you smile through tears of joy. Thanks to fine acting, writing and directing.

Lassie's search for her young master. Brutish but happily finally beaten villain. Dog haters and their just reward. Men at their best. Men at their worst. Sentimental love. Ignorant hate. A dwarf puppeteer. Cute dogs, big scary dogs. No cats. Laughing, crying children. A Loch Ness Monster for a minute. Cold, nasty school teacher. Buffoon cops and dog catchers. Christmas carols.  Rugged, stunningly ruggedly beautiful scenery of Scotland. Travails and happy endings. Chases and recoveries. Tears and comeuppance's. Melodrama definitely not of this century.

Simple?  Anything but under the simplicity. You'll see. I had a dog once, lost it. 'Lassie'
really touched me. Five Stars mean I loved it. More than anything 'Lassie' is about love.

It's 1939 and war is brewing (though most people don't agree) when the Yorkshire mine in which Sam Carraclough (John Lynch) labors is abruptly shut down.  To get money to support his wife (Samantha Morton) and young son Joe (Jonathan Mason), he finally gives in to the local Duke (Peter O'Toole) and sells him Joe's beloved collie Lassie.  But Lassie won't stay sold: she keeps escaping to go back to Joe--until the Duke takes her and several other dogs to his estate far in the north of Scotland.  And even that isn't far enough to keep her away from her boy, for she breaks out once more and begins an epic journey south and home.

Among the high points of the film are the expanded focus on the relationships between Joe and his parents (his mother is a much more sympathetic character than she was in the original) and between the Duke and his young granddaughter Cilla (Hester Odgers), whose parents, fearful that London ""isn't safe,"" send her first to stay with her grandfather and then to a boarding school which she hates, and who therefore sympathizes with Lassie's powerful drive to go home.  This, of course, does mean that some of the incidents of Lassie's journey (most notably her brush with a couple of shepherds who mistake her for a sheep-killer and her sojourn with a lonely elderly couple) had to be deleted from the script, while others--particularly her time with Rowlie Palmer (Peter Dinklage), who here is a dwarf puppetteer rather than a potter/tinker--are altered or even expanded (her experience with the pound authorities in Glasgow).  There's even a glimpse of the silhouette of the Loch Ness Monster beneath the murky waters as Lassie prepares to circumnavigate the loch!  Families might enjoy watching the two versions on successive nights or even as a double feature and discussing what was changed and why.",1278115200,3,2107,5.231454005934718

2654570,5,B000ICL3M4,"Wow! This film is true to the original story: authentic of life in Great Britian in pre WWII.  The cinematography is fantastic--you want to climb right into the movie and be with Lassie.  An exceptional film.  As a side note, I show it to my students the day before winter vacation and they adore it!  Some ask to borrow it over vaction to share with their families!",1267833600,3,366,4.417910447761194
2654571,5,B000ICL3M4,"This version of ""Lassie,"" is perhaps the best film adaptation of that classic, heart-wrenching animal adventure story.  The British context, rife with class politics and working-class fatalism, is fully explored; the sweeping Scottish landscape is stunningly embraced, and, most important of all, the script and acting are quite good. Peter O'Toole is in fine form, and the collie playing Lassie is absolutely gorgeous. This is a lovely version of this well-known story, with no skimping on either production values or writing.  Definitely recommended.  (ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1264291200,2,594,5.804597701149425
2654572,5,B000ICL3M4,"Beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted by the cast - especially the dog, Mason, who is VERY expressive and responsive.  As a long time Lassie fan and a long time dog trainer, this is the best.  My kids loved it.  It reflects perfectly the spirit of that first, old Roddy McDowell film, but this dog is a better actor, as much as I loved Pal!  Great cinematography. Great acting from Samantha Morton, Jemma Redgrave and Peter O'Toole, but especially from the new child actors and Mason the Collie.  Lovely work on the subtext of the class differences in 1940s Britain.

Great, great stuff.  Too bad it didn't get more press in it's first release.

Good for kids old enough to understand animals and that death, sometimes, sadly, is part of life.  Very uplifting ending.",1220140800,4,767,4.75
2654573,4,B000ICL3M4,"Living in a small Yorkshire town on the eve of the Second World War ,the Carraclough parents (John Lynch and Samantha Morton)are forced by the impending loss of the father's livelihood caused by the closure of the coal mine upon which the local economy depends to sell their beloved family dog Lassie to the local landowner the Duke of Ruding(Peter O'Toole).He buys it as a gift for his beloved niece Cilla (Hester Odgers)who is missing her father ,now enlisted in the Army and fighting in France .This is against the wishes of both the dog and the Carracloughs small son  Joe (Jonathan Mason).The dog escapes several times after suffering abuse at the hands of the kennelman Hynes (Steve Pemberton)and returns home ,until the Duke removes the dog and Cilla to his family estates in Scotland
 Cilla who realises where Lassie's true affections lie  helps the dog escape and Lassie sets out to travel the 500 miles back home .She has many adventures en route -an encounter with two monster watchers on Loch Ness (delightful cameos fron John Standing and Edward Fox),a Glaswegian dog catcher (Gregor Fisher)and a judge (Robert Hardy)a travelling puppeteer (Peter Dinklage on fine form)and two ne'er do wells (Nicholas Lyndhurst and Celyn Jones)whose plans for the dog are not exactly humane .Can she make it back home -and remain there ?

Charles Sturridge directs with a strong feeling for both the story and the landscape. The sense of period is strong and the moral backbone of the movie is firm .The score is traditional  with lots of sweeping strings and tugging at the heartstrings. In short it is old school children's film making and can be enjoyed by all the family .It never resorts to cheap sentimentality and never patronises its audience .

The acting is spot on by all concerned O'Toole being specially good and the dog is delightful. It is a pity that this lovely little movie got swamped at the box office by giant apes ,cuddly penguins and talking lions",1202428800,,1967,4.839285714285714
2654574,4,B000ICL3M4,"Dear Amazon:
  The movie ""Lassie"" was a very nice family film in a beautiful setting of England and Scotland.  The scenery was very beautiful and a nice story that will be very satisfying for dog lovers, and Lassie movie followers.
  A movie for young and old, pure entertainment in a very nice tasteful manner.

2654575,5,B000ICL3M4,"Sometimes I'm in the mood for a film with a beautiful star that includes some heavy panting, a stand-in nipple, and a psycho-sexual subplot.  Well all of this is evident in Lassie, a masterful throwback to an earlier clichd format: boy loves dog, dog loves boy (but only an implied and heart warming zoophilia). It's just a darn good movie.  The panting is the dog's, and the octo-nippled heroine is really a cross dressing star, but you won't know that unless you watch the special features. One thing is for sure, you  will be rooting for Lassie to escape from one scene to the next.  Will Lassie really get home?  I won't say, but if you like good acting (the child actors are so good), beautiful scenery (from the highlands of Scotland to the Isle of Mann), and snow at Christmas, you are bound to enjoy this film.  The only thing that would have made this better would have been if it had been produced in Bollywood and brightly colored saris had been added to a dance sequence.  Spoiler alert--a great movie!",1198972800,,1014,4.538461538461538
2654576,3,B000ICL3M4,"One of the books that made me fall in love with reading is the original story, Lassie Come Home, written by Eric Knight in 1940. I still have my old, ""dog-eared"" copy. I was so looking forward to watching this highly praised modern adaptation, only to be disappointed.

One of the problems today with making a movie ""for kids"" is dumbing down the story and throwing in evil and comic elements. After all, kids love simple, funny stories pitting good against evil, right? In so doing, Lassie's long journey back home is given short shrift, no doubt because kids might get bored. There are sadistic characters in this film that are absent in the book. There is the cruel and unnecessary killing of a dog. And if it is possible to judge, I would say that the dog playing the role of Lassie can't act her way out of a paper bag; Lassie's happy and sad faces were virtually indistinguishable.

Do yourself and your kids a favor and read the book instead. If your kids are too young to read the original novel, there is a wonderful picture book version by Rosemary Wells and Susan Jeffers.",1192320000,3,1083,4.520408163265306
2654577,5,B000ICL3M4,"This is a movie I just rented and viewed with my 7 year old son and 15 year old daughter.  All of us sat and snuggled as we laughed, cried, and appreciated this movie.  May I just say that it was simply a refreshing slice of authentic beauty?  Every aspect of this film was thoroughly and artfully rendered into a moving tale.

Given the skeletal premise of the plot - a boy misses his loyal dog who travel great lengths to return home - the intelligence behind the creation is astounding.

If you are looking for simple entertainment for your child to watch and escape the realities of this life, do not count on this story to provide that.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a story to inspire your child while providing a reasonable array of emotions, this one is for you!  There is an undercurrent of struggle, ranging from mistreatment of animals and children to realities of war and poverty.  ( I would not recommend the stroy for the very young )  However, the power of love to overcome these challenges is thematically shown through beauty, joy, perseverence, and serendipity.  Congratulations to the director, actors, and production staff.

Do not be decieved by the simple cover.  The movie is much more profound.

2654580,5,B000ICL3M4,"This whole movie is charming but Peter O'Toole, to my mind, keeps the movie firmly in balance, neither too sentimental or too serious. He is, as always, a consumate actor and you can see just what a perfectionist he is when watching the Outtakes (some are pretty funny). He can laugh at himself and often does and seems to be having a great deal of fun in this film.

  The DVD is well worth purchasing because it not only retells the beloved story of Lassie's attempt to get back to her family but contains a wealth of bonus features, unlike some DVDs. There is a special Animal Planet feature filmed from the set, cast and crew interviews and behind the scenes info as well as actual Animal Auditions! There was a lot of work put into this DVD and it shows.

  This is a film that will be of interest, on some level, to everyone in the family. Even if the movie itself isn't your favorite part of the DVD (but it was for me), the Bonus Features are engaging.",1176422400,19,960,4.305555555555555
2654581,5,B000ICL3M4,"I found this to be an excellent heartwarming movie. Some parts were sad but it ended up happy, and the storyline was great. It reminded me somewhat of Lassie Come Home in the 40s but this movie was better and had more of a story to it. Great movie. Loved the characters. The actors, and the acting simply the best. Loved the little boy and the girl. It was set in the old days in a coal mining town. Loved the way the dog bonded with the girl and her grandfater as well as with the gypsy midget and his cute little dog. I am definitely going to buy this movie. My husband loved it and he wants it, and he doesn't like dog or animal stories that much but he thought that this one was excelllent. Well worth the money to rent even buy. My 7 year old son and 10 year old daughter loved it. Even my oldest son who is 14 loved it. Anyone who loves dog stories or Lassie or has children, this movie is well worth it.

8144805,4,B000ICL3M4,"Intelligent, well made family feature from the original novel, bearing little resemblance to the now campy-seeming US TV series.

Beautifully shot, well scored, and featuring a first-rate adult cast (Peter O'Toole, Samantha Morton, John Lynch, Peter Dinkage) along with some very endearing child actors, this manages to be sweet without being saccharine, sentimental without being cloying.

It even has a nice layer of social commentary about the English class system  the story involves the beloved pet being bought away from a near-starving family who can't afford to say 'no' when a lord offers them cash for their son's faithful companion.

I appreciated that Lassie is treated as a real dog, and not some kind of super-mutt. A great, wonderful dog to be sure, but her behaviors all stay within the realm of real-life dog abilities.

A very good film for kids and tweens, and a not at all bad one for grown ups who might watch with them. While it might not have quite the deep emotional power and/or wild humor of the truly classic family films, it's certainly well crafted and worth watching.",1494633600,,1097,4.940217391304348
