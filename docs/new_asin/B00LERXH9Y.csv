6480894,5,B00LERXH9Y,"I'm always intrigued to see a great show maintain its quality for more than three seasons, because even the greatest ones tend to fizzle out in their later years. And then there's Shameless, continuing to evolve while staying true to itself; managing to avoid retread while believably amping up the tension.

I'll be honest - the first couple episodes of Season Four had me worried that the writing may have finally started to decline. The jokes weren't very funny, the tone was slippery, the pacing was off and a few of our protagonists were acting oddly out of character. Thankfully, the writers were just carefully setting up what was to come, and the rest of the season is excellent.

The humor is toned down a bit, but the drama is more potent than ever. If you thought the Gallaghers were struggling *before*...well, you're in for a surprise or two.

Yes, Shameless can seem schlocky and gratuitous on the surface - I was skeptical for years, and based on the little I had seen, was expecting yet another example of ""shock you for the sake of shocking you"" premium cable dreck. I've never been more wrong...there's just as much intelligent plotting and thematic depth here as anything else I've watched, and the characters are unforgettable.

The final scene with Frank and Carl at Lake Michigan has a raw power that reminds me of the best of cinema, on par with Akira Kurosawa's abilities to slowly but surely manipulate the audience's emotions, and in turn make you truly care about the characters, their struggles, and their triumphs. To display this level of catharsis and poignancy, this late in a show's run, is quite a feat.

LONG LIVE THE GALLAGHERS",1406332800,23,1663,4.780487804878049
6480895,5,B00LERXH9Y,"Shameless is one of my favorite TV shows. It has consistently stayed well written and acted and directed through four seasons now. Season 4 might be the strongest and best season yet. How Emmy Rossum, William H. Macy, and Jeremy Allen White have been overlooked for the last three years for Emmy nominations is beyond me. While William H. Macy (Frank Gallagher) is a bit underused this season, Emmy Rossum (Fiona Gallagher) and Jeremy Allen White (Phillip ""Lip"" Gallagher) give their best performances yet. Season 4 is just like the previous three seasons, lots of laughs, lots of raw emotion, nudity, drug and alcohol use, and shocking moments. After every season ends, my girlfriend and I miss spending time with the Gallagher family. It seems like the season flies by, even though waiting week to week for a new episode seems to last forever. I can't wait to rewatch season 4 without any week long breaks. If you haven't seen season 4 yet, you're in for a big shocker at the end of the season finale. So when the credits start to roll on the final episode of season 4, don't turn it off. There is a big shocker during the end credits. If you haven't watched Shameless yet, you need to. FULLY APPROVED.",1405555200,39,1204,4.630841121495327
6480896,5,B00LERXH9Y,"The Fourth Season of Shameless is getting better & Better, Lip is getting ready to drop out of College. Fiona is now getting a little bolder, as far as showing that beautiful body, she now has a steady job and enjoying the paycheck. Frank is in need for a new liver and end up in intensive care. Great season to be enjoyed over and over again. I truly enjoyed it",1514505600,,362,4.185714285714286

I'm still kinda rollin' in shock to see the lady from Phantom of the Opera in such an in-your-face role. Wow. Completely opposite end of the spectrum. Good to see Joan Cusack; I think she's an underrated actress. Adore the hell out of 'V' and 'Kev'.

6481010,5,B00LERXH9Y,"This series pushes a person from laughter to tears quickly and with huge gusto.  It's close enough to the bone that you can relate to the situations this South Side Chicago family encounters and how they survive by sticking together for the most part, dealing with the depths of life's vagaries.  The situations are close enough to some kind of reality in most peoples' real lives, that it becomes gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for whatever insane life situation comes next.  The whole series is outrageous, funny, filled with pathos, and lots of reality pushed to the limits.  William H. Macy is definitely one of the most talented writer/producer/actors of a lifetime when it comes to depicting the American situation.",1469318400,3,746,4.896825396825397

6481015,3,B00LERXH9Y,"Some will like/love this and there are those who won't make it past the first episode. I could palette the moral decay celebrated in Shameless for a while, but my interest was more easily lost as time progressed. I finally got to the point where it didn't matter if I finished another episode. I've not completely ruled out flipping to it, but haven't the urge to do so, as there is always something on that will entertain me more than Shameless did. William H. Macy mastered/masters his character brilliantly, however. The cast are extremely talented all around but no one can act their way out of mediocre, pandering plots/writing.",1468540800,,633,4.81651376146789

6481018,1,B00LERXH9Y,"Shame on Showtime and Amazon. Greed abounds. Use this one star review as proof that I am cancelling the add-on subscription to Showtime. We love this series, but Season 6 is no longer available to us through the add-on. As we do not pay for extras on Comcast, streaming is our only option to catch magnificently acted and produced shows like Shameless. Boo! We're going to miss the Gallagher family, but enough is enough. Either we receive premium shows for premium rates, or we make do with Netflix. If the trend continues to withhold popular shows from add-on subscriptions, what is the point? (BTW: You can catch the first four seasons of Shameless on Netflix without any add-on premiums!) Goodbye Showtime. Amazon, take note: once these cancellations begin to pile up due to shady policies dictated by premium networks, it will affect your bottom dollar.",1468454400,2,858,4.924137931034482

6481184,3,B00LERXH9Y,"I am a big fan of the series, but this season hold few surprises, it is long on
stupidity on the part of the G family and short on any real believability. A family
with this degree of misfortune, criminal activity, stupidity could not keep coming
back together. The characters and situations in this season are so unbelievable
that I could hardly watch it--like those old I Love Lucy shows where you think
""nobody is that stupid"" and instead of laughing just turn the channel. Fiona's
character has become one dimensional and Frank in the final episode takes the
prize for the most unbelievably stupid moron on the planet. But it is the writers who
are to blame, the actors all do a decent job given what they have to work with--a
pile of unbelievable situations with equally unbelievable outcomes for a bunch of
characters that have gone from lovably ""shameless"" to just repugnant. Lip and
his new college ""girlfriend"" are the only characters worth watching this season,
Carl and Ian's character's have also become quite one dimensional and quite
repulsive--in fact I couldn't find much in any of the characters this season to ""root
for"" ,save Lip, perhaps that is the problem--it is difficult to empathize with people
with no redeeming qualities, New writers are in order.",1439164800,4,1274,4.848623853211009

6481324,5,B00LERXH9Y,"Shameless is my favorite TV series. It's not perfect (what is?), but the story arcs among all the many characters are always honest. It's difficult not to get involved with the week to week problems these characters go through.  The actors, across the board, are really, REALLY good! I can't say enough about them, in particular, Noel Fisher. Mickey is the most complex character on the show, and Noel brings out his intensity and humor brilliantly. If you have not seen the show, give it a try, It may not speak to you as it does to me, but it won't be a waste of time.",1422403200,3,570,4.377358490566038

6481333,5,B00LERXH9Y,"Shameless is my new favorite show. I just recently started subscribing to Showtime (after the cable company found out we were pirating HBO and took it away!) So that means I have to get into Showtime's shows now instead of HBO's. Our On Demand only offers season 4 of Shameless but I decided to give it a try. I consider myself very picky so I usually give a new show approximately 30 seconds to wow me. This show immediately did just that. Starting with the catchy opening song and then delving right into the lives of the hilarious and intriguing Gallagher clan I was hooked. The show is kind of like a cross between ""Married With Children"" and ""Party Of Five."" I expected the shining star to be solely William Macy but surprisingly the kids can and do hold their own in this ensemble piece. The characters are hilarious and the script is fantastic. The kids are funny and there never seems to be a dull moment with them. (Carl may be my favorite.) The acting is terrific and never over the top. I also like the surrounding characters who are equally as interesting. I have only seen the first half of season 4 but felt like writing about it since it has been so long since I've found decent tv to fill the void left by Breaking Bad's departure. I haven't been this excited about a tv show since I discovered ""Damages"" a few years ago. I've ordered seasons 1-3 so am eagerly anticipating their arrival. Then I can catch up with season 5 along with the rest of the Shameless fans. Since this show is a Showtime show be prepared for some profanity and a few sex scenes. I've written in reviews before how I don't care for excessive profanity and overly graphic sex scenes but this show does not push those things ad nauseam. I can tolerate a little of that but too much is a turn off. I can watch this show and enjoy it without blushing. This is my first Showtime show but I enjoyed HBO shows such as ""Sex and The City"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" In addition to the shows I've already mentioned liking in this review I'm also a fan of all AMC shows especially seasons 1-4 of ""Mad Men,"" ""Hell On Wheels"" and ""Halt and Catch Fire."" Shameless is a bit dark so I guess it's accurate to call it a black comedy. There is a fair amount of drama. All in all this is great entertainment for people who appreciate watching dysfunctional families, neighbors and friends. Poverty and addiction have never been more hilarious!",1421798400,,2414,4.4391891891891895

They bring to the everyday struggles of five children who are forced to fend for themselves because their father, Frank,  is an alcoholic who is constantly thinking of schemes to feed his addiction and their mother ran off.  While often it may seem the things they do are over the top the writers never take the show beyond the realm of reality.  William Macy is nothing short of amazing in his depiction of Frank.  Joan Cusack also does a great job

6481408,5,B00LERXH9Y,"I cannot get enough of this show! On the surface, it may seem a bit unrealistic, but there are surprising depths to the stories, the characters, and the struggles they go through. The relationship between Ian and Mickey, and it's progression over the past 4 seasons, is one that I can't wait to continue following in the next season. They have evolved so much!

Love love love this show!!",1410220800,3,388,4.6231884057971016

6481411,5,B00LERXH9Y,"Like the name of the show suggests, it has no filter whatsoever and it's definitely not a bad thing... Quite the opposite in fact. I'd have to say that it's better than previous seasons especially when it comes to the more dramatic scenes. It's almost an unpredictable show that gives you all of this happiness and then just rips it away in this season but it hurts so good! I'd say it kept me on my toes in almost every episode especially in certain ones. In short, the writing is still as good as ever which is usually odd for shows in their 4th season and not a moment is wasted in each episode. It has a lot of heart and you can't help but feel for this family or at the very least relate to the characters in ways.",1409356800,12,719,4.142857142857143
6481412,5,B00LERXH9Y,"All I have to say is that this series gets better and better. Each turn there is something new. While it is funny, dark at times, it also has depth. I must say... I was missing Jimmy through out this season. Can't wait for the next one.

The kids are fanastic actors, they make up so much of the story line and never disappoint!",1409270400,10,328,4.125
6481413,5,B00LERXH9Y,"Fantastic. Genus.
The only reason this show does not get as much accolades as Breaking Bad, another great show, is because its not widely available on the internet and on TV reruns off its parent station.  Amazon had to wait close to six months after the fourth season run to add it to its inventory.  If this show was more widely distributed it would sweep all the TV awards.",1409184000,12,376,4.434782608695652

6481415,3,B00LERXH9Y,"The Gallergers were entertaining as usual. This arc primarily concerned Fiona dealing with her issues, Lip facing adversity, and Frank once again surviving through many degradations and near-deaths. There is a lot of comedy arising from the situations, and also, a lot of drama. I gave this three stars because I liked it fine, but didn't see it as any type of breakthrough in television. I don't believe someone coming to this season new and not knowing the characters would find this very engaging television. Frank's schtick gets really tired at some points.",1408924800,,561,5.043010752688172

8665432,5,B00LERXH9Y,the show is funny as hell. Tragic that the entire family are damaged goods.  OMG  Frank would have been gone at my house but they keep letting him back in because they are all terrible LOL. NONE of them are normal the stuff that they do is beyond anyone with rational thinking would do. I thought Fiona was responsible she is just as trifling they are what people call PWT. Matter of fact if you look PWT up in the dictionary you would see their family picture.,1522195200,,461,4.287356321839081
