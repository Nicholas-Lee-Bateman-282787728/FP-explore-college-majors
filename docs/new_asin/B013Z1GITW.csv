8729228,4,B013Z1GITW,"You do not have to speak Hebrew to enjoy this movie (but it would help). Zero Motivation follows the story of a handful of Israeli Defense Force (IDF) conscripts at an outpost in the midst of nowhere.

The three main characters, Admin LT, one admin assistant who would become an officer and one, Zohan, the center of the story.
