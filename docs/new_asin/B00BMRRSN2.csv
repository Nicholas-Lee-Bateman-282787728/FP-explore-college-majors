8570967,1,B00BMRRSN2,"I haven't been able to view my QuickPro Camera Guide. When I put the DVD into the computer there was the message that it won't open with Preview. The instructions were to obtain a different  app or program to open the Nikon D5200 QuickPro Guide. No suggestions about what would open the Guide.  Internet Express is not making anything for my operating system. Surely the the people who produced  the guide know what opens it. How frustrating that there is no list of what would work with various computers. No instruction sheet. As I remember their web site it was hard to find help. The package proclaims,""EASY T0 USE,"" which may be true if you can see it.",1416700800,,657,4.5508474576271185

8570972,3,B00BMRRSN2,"This video is helpful for understanding the basic functions of the camera, but the publisher assumes a fair amount of foreknowledge of terminology.  From the perspective of a complete beginner, I am not well versed in some of the langauage of photography, and I could benefit from additional clarification in several places.  Further, I was hopeful that the video would demomstrate techniques and settings.  However, only a few photographs are provided to illustrate what a setting does.  True hands-on photography techniques are sold by the publisher under additional video titles.

While the video is certainly worth having, some of the information is available for free on youtube.  Subsequently, the video is slightly over priced for the array of information presented.",1387756800,4,773,5.4
