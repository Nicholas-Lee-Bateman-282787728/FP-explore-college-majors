1621953,4,B00005LIRO,I watched this movie growing up it was like my Hocus Pocus around Halloween. I had been trying to find it for a while and I watched it on Halloween night and I felt like I was 12 again. Great movie! Really shows that even though someone looks different they have a kind heart inside.,1352678400,,283,4.163636363636364
1621954,5,B00005LIRO,It's all about the candy and decorations in this movie...adults won't mind watching this one with their kiddos! It's my favorite Halloween flick.,1349568000,,145,5.3478260869565215
1621955,4,B00005LIRO,"Even though I am....... 30 years old, when it comes to Halloween and Christmas I am still a child. I am constantly trying to get my hands on something new to watch for Halloween and luckily I found this last year. Actually I saw a wee bit of it when it first came out, but I only caught the last few minutes of it when they are all in Curtis Danko's house. What I love about movies like this is the fact that I don't have any preconceive notions. When a movie is supposed to be for a 12 year old kid and I am way too old to be watching it, I just sit back and enjoy. Sometimes when I watch kid movies it can be hit or miss, but luckily this was a hit.

It's has Christopher Lloyd and watching him act is always a joy, the cast is great, it's funny, it's got the right amount of cheese and I really enjoy Joe Pichler's performance. If you are a parent and you are stuck watching this with your kid, don't worry you probably will be entertained enough. The movie is set in a beautiful town which has great scenery, it has a great fallish vibe which makes me want to drink cider, the story is interesting and quite dark if you really think about it. I don't want to give anything away, but somebody should be in jail! This movie may be a little too dark for kids under 7 especially if they don't know anything about death, but either than that When Ghouls Go Bad is pretty harmless.

The last thing I must mention has completely changed the way I look at this movie and that is Joe Pichler who plays Danny Walker went missing in 2006 and hasn't been heard from since. It's very scary to think about that just a few short years later this young boy would never be heard from again. Now I find the movie to be truly scary. One day I hope he is found alive and healthy.",1349136000,,1763,4.063218390804598
1621956,5,B00005LIRO,"My daughter and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie I found it at target in the Halloween section for under $10 and its well worth the money! After seeing this movie it started a Halloween tradition to buy a Halloween movie and book each year. And as soon as September hits im already wanting to watch hallowern movies and of course it always starts out with this movie. We have watched it so many times that iv had to get the disc repaired. Its perfect for kids,teens and adults its even got a few laughs in it. The best part of all when you watch it it brings back memories of being a kid on Halloween night the feelings you get going in the dark door to door trick or treating or going to haunted houses its like when you watch it  you can just smell the cool crisp air and hot apple cider. I also recommend tbe Disney movie ""Underwraps"" ""Hocus Pocus"" and the ""Halloween town movies"" I think theres 3 or 4. =) Hope your family has the experience I had with this movie.",1347580800,,963,4.17741935483871
1621957,5,B00005LIRO,I bought this without watching first.  I was afraid it would be stupid.  Actually it turned out to be kind of cute.  A great movie for kids.,1325203200,,140,4.111111111111111

1621962,5,B00005LIRO,"This is another great family film based on a book by none other than the Horror King for Kids, R. L. Stine.  It's a charming offering, nothing short of great Halloween fun for everyone in the family.  I suppose children younger than 5 or so might not be keen on the grandfather (Christopher Lloyd, who by the way, was fantastic in this)coming back from the dead as a zombie, even though it's really quite comical.  Truthfully, it got my 6 year old to ask some intruiging questions about life, death and heaven.  She didn't seem frightened in the least, and I think the ending scenes of the dead dancing with the fireflys and gently waltzing into dust was oddly comforting.  It was funny, it was scary, it was great family fun and as it turns out, is a favorite amongst many teenagers we are acquainted with.  R. L. Stine is always a favorite with kids, and this movie won't disappoint his many fans.",1273622400,6,899,4.484662576687117
1621963,1,B00005LIRO,"When Good Ghouls Go Bad (Patrick Read Johnson, 2001)

I now find myself forced to ask questions that it never occurred to me I would have to: what in the world is the Syfy Channel doing showing a movie that was originally made for ABC Family, that absolutely horrid station that is ABC's (and was originally Fox's) attempt to capture part of the screaming-adolescent market currently held by Disney Channel and Nickelodeon? And why didn't the description warn me about this when I went to record it? Most importantly, why in the world didn't I turn it off when I realized what I was getting myself into?

Plot, in the smallest nutshell I can find: the town of Walker Falls does not celebrate Halloween, and hasn't in the twenty years since a dying Curtis Danko laid a curse on the town. James Walker (Everwood's Tom Amandes), the umpty-great-grandson of the town's founder, has come back to town to reopen his father's chocolate factory, which was shut down after the curse (there's some sort of rationalization about how a chocolate factory will encourage kids to celebrate Halloween, or something). While the townsfolk are afraid the reopening of the plant will set off the curse, there's no denying the economy needs it. James plans to reopen the plant on Halloween, with a big party. Needless to say, the curse is real, and a whole bunch of oddly cute ghouls, including the recently-deceased eccentric Uncle Fred (Christopher Lloyd), pop up to remind the townspeople that this might not be the world's best idea.

I'll start off by saying that if you are the kind of person who is capable of withstanding the sound of shrieking adolescents, then you and I are coming from very different places, and this review does not apply to you. (The acid test: if you can watch five minutes of That's So Raven without wanting to tear your hair out.) I find it an even more unbearable sound than shrieking babies, so I find the vast bulk of programming on channels like Disney, Nick, and ABC Family painful. Yes, actually, physically painful. In order for me to give an original movie from one of those stations even a mediocre review, it would have to have an Oscar-worthy script, a prodigy director, a top-notch cast who all brought their A game, or some combination of the above. When Good Ghouls Go Bad, not surprisingly, has none of these elements; the script is about as good as can be expected given that Johnson (whose biggest previous writing credit was the terrible, terrible 1990 stoner comedy Spaced Invaders) was adapting a story from R. L. Stine, who can charitably be described as the Danielle Steel of teen horror. As a director, Johnson has hardly fared better. When your best-known directorial credit is a movie often regarded as one of the worst in history (Baby's Day Out), there's really nowhere to go but up...unless you just stay on the same plane, which seems to be Johnson's MO. And the cast? Lloyd is the biggest of the bunch, and let's face it, since Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Lloyd's career has been a painful illustration of the downward spiral. (With the notable exception of Wit, released, ironically, the same year as this mess.) It's terrible through and through. The only reason I'm giving it half a star is because, for some reason I cannot entirely fathom, I did not turn it off. ",1268697600,,3308,4.72790294627383
1621964,4,B00005LIRO,"SPOILER ALERT!  (this review contains some info that may be spoilers)

Christopher Lloyd is hilarious as the older relative of a young boy.  They recently moved to a new town where people are absolutely terrified of Halloween.  Anyone who dares to put up Halloween decorations soon finds them gone.  The movie goes into the town's history and why the people do not celebrate or have any fun during Halloween.  But as the movie goes along we realize that people have been misled, and after some scarey scenes, the issue is resolved.  The DVD cover shows Lloyd as a ghoul, also for a good reason.  But he's a funny, lovable ghoul.

Why is it not for very young kids?  Well, unless they've been watching movies about Ghouls, people rising from the dead, and a teen being killed is a gruesome way, it may be a bit too intense for them.  This is done in a funny vein but the scenes are also scarey.",1261440000,,893,4.450617283950617
1621965,4,B00005LIRO,I think this is a good Halloween movie. It has lots of action and not to scary for the young.,1260576000,,93,3.7

1621967,4,B00005LIRO,"Orignally bought this for the kids on video.  Viewed so frequently we needed a new copy on DVD.  Mild gore keeps the kids engrossed, but I love the humor - ""I fell victim to a compelling urban legend."" - is a popular line in our household.  The cast is good, particularly Christopher Lloyd.
Have never been a fan of R.L. Stein and Goosebumps, but I this has a dif-
ferent feel to it.  The ending is touching and perhaps a bit romantic.
Our entire household, ages 11 to 47, views this at least once a year, an annual Halloween event.",1229385600,,532,4.29
1621968,5,B00005LIRO,This is a fun movie for family viewing around Halloween. Might frighten little ones a bit.,1223769600,,90,4.6875
1621969,5,B00005LIRO,"An excellent ""fun for the whole family"" halloween film:)  It is geared more toward young teens but a delightful Halloween movie for all ages!  It is based around bringing the spirit of Halloween into a town that has essentially banned all to do with ""Halloween"".

It brought back some great memories.  I love this movie.  Great flick for the whole family, and since it was written by R.L. Stine, it's great for all ages.",1203811200,3,326,3.9692307692307693

From Goosebumps' author R.L. Stine comes this delighful Halloween-themed tale, both charming and evocatively enjoyable:

Founded by the delightfully eccentric ""Uncle"" Fred Walker, Walker Falls has not seen a Halloween for years because of a purported ""curse"" placed upon it by one ""Curtis Danko"" {obvious 'Donnie Darko' influenced nomenclature}, labeled the town ""weirdo"" for his preference to dress in black, and express his imagination with monsters, and scenes of a world gone mad. His creativity is clearly envied by others, and thus, they react in fearful passive-aggressive manners which are no less than despicable, displaying their inferior and odious ill-natures.

So once when the art class project was to sculpt a depiction of one's hero*, the school bully and cronies lock him in the incinerator as a prank. He actually resembles Edward Scissorhands while sculpting.

Urban Legend: He refused for anyone to see his project, guarding it from all during the day. He returns at night to work on it in private. Next one morning, when Mike Kankel walks into the classroom, he notices something is wrong, and discovers Danko's ashes in the incinerator with his statue, with a forboding message written in the ashes, that if the town celebrates Halloween, he will return and face his wrath:

""If you ever have another Halloween again, I will return and destroy you all!""

Kankel pretends at blindness, claiming that the statue is so terrible that no one should look upon it as if made by someone counceled by The Devil, lest they go blind, or head explode, or even turn to stone, a-la Medusa's glare. So the ashes and statue are sealed within a crypt with nicely arranged cob-webbed chains.

Factuality: After a teasing session, Danko is incarcerated in the incinerator to be left until the following morning. Unfortunately, an absent-minded janitor accidentally taps the 'on' button, immolating Danko. Terrified of being blamed for his murder, he writes the warning in the ashes himself and claims that looking upon the statue blinded him for three days. It was later confessed that now Coach Kankel did it because funds were being directed into the fine arts at the school instead of sports activities.

'Uncle' Walker's grandson Danny arrives from Chicago to attend this new school, and is bullied by Kankel's son and his moronic hench boy. Despite this, he befriends Dayna who shows him marvelous secrets within Danko's haunted house, where, unbeknownst to the a-dolt towns people, the Magic of Halloween has been preserved - skeletons, skulls, demons, monsters, ghouls, bats, spiders, ghosts, zombies, witches, are all here in this abandoned mansion to be enjoyed in secret by the towns children**.

When Danny's business-minded father James suggests the town hold a ""Spooktacular"" Halloween celebration at a town meeting, the residents go bananas with fear, especially when time and time again, Halloween decorations begin mysteriously appearing about. James Walker seeks to re-open the Walker Chocolate factory {also founded by nucleus Uncle Walker, in a Willy Wonka vein}, with the help of soon-arriving German Businessmen, and the support of the towns people.

Uncle Walker is quite a character, who listens to his Hammond Organ recordings on his jukebox, building elaborate tracks for his hot wheels, surrounded by amusing nick knacks, while attired in various playful outfits. He serves as a true father for Danny, since his dad is virtually un-present in the goings-on of his life. Someone who could actually offer the wisdom of experience as well as be a playmate and friend. Also mentionable is the sage wisdom imparted to Danny about the Magic of Halloween...

So when he apparently dies from a bash on the head by a falling pumpkin from a veritable pumpkin mountain pile which strangely appears in the town square, his heart is broken until he later returns as a zombie to help him place Danko's statue in its rightful place. In the meantime, several amusing circumstances unfold including the appearance of 'Cheesy The Clown' {quite a Lokian depiction}, and Uncle Walker retrieving his runaway hand, a-la Thing {especially humorous considering Christopher Lloyd wonderfully portrayed Uncle Fester in treasured films 'The Addams Family' & 'Addams Family Values'}.

When Danko returns from the grave with green-glowing eyes in skeletal form, who along with various other zombies, at the secret Halloween dance, all is finally set to balance as Halloween is restored, after a shameful spectacle and confession by Coach Kankel, the statue is finally seen, which provides for quite a surprise, followed by a moving ending scene and narration.

* Interesting to note that I actually sculpted a statue for art class of a Baphomet-headed Satan in a robe wearing a pentagram medallion, holding a sword in one hand and signifying The Cornu with the other. To My surprise, Sgt. Randy Emon was notified, who took photos of it for his occult portfolio.

** It can be observed that the mansion may also be considered a metaphor for the subconscious accumulation of archetypal images of fear and memento moris, waiting to be released and celebrated. To deny them only causes an unbalanced psyche.",1201392000,4,5259,5.186320754716981
1621972,4,B00005LIRO,"We first saw this movie on ABC Family.  It's just enough of a scare for the entire family no matter the age.  There's humor, too!",1168300800,,129,4.12
1621973,4,B00005LIRO,"This was orginally a TV movie which plays every year on the Family Channel.  As family Halloween movies go it's pretty decent.  Not so scary that very young ones cannot watch but good enough that adults will enjoy it as well.

The story was written or at least based on a story by R.L. Stine of Goosebumps fame and really plays like an extended episode of the old Goosebumps TV show.

A wonderful imaginative and fun Halloween story. Of course one must suspend belief for a while, but it is worth watching. Christopher Lloyd is his usual manic self, and brings life to what would be a typical zombie/monster movie without his energized performance.

When 12 year old Danny Walker moves to his Patriarchal home town in Minnesota he finds that the town does not celebrate Halloween, and things are not quite what they appear to be.

An enjoyable movie that may be destined to be a Halloween classic.",1098403200,17,897,4.610062893081761
1621974,4,B00005LIRO,"WHEN GOOD GHOULS GO BAD is a made for television movie, based upon a R.L. Stine story that first aired a few years ago on the Fox channel. The movie is narrated by and stars Christopher Lloyd as the patron of his small town. He has everyone call him Uncle Fred, including his own son and grandson and is a town legend. Uncle Fred used to own the chocolate factory that was the town's bread and butter. However, after a tragic accident involving a baking kiln that Uncle Fred had donated to the local high school, he shut the factory down and the town has been struggling ever since. However, with the accident at the school there also came a curse, that the town was to never celebrate Halloween again or else the young man who was baked alive would come back from the grave to destroy the town. Twenty years pass and Uncle Fred's son and grandson move back to town, wanting to celebrate Halloween. However, the townspeople won't have it. Then strange events start to happen and things go from strange to just plain bizarre.
WHEN GOOD GHOULS GO BAD is a good family Halloween movie to watch together. There isn't anything too scary and much of what could be frightening is tapered with a good sense of humor. The story is easy to follow and the acting is fairly well done for a made for tv flick. Christopher Lloyd is always a joy to watch and if for no other reason, this movie is worth watching for his performance. There aren't a whole lot of deep messages in the movie, though it does have a lot to say about the importance of family and staying connected (in more ways than one). Happy Halloween viewing.",1065398400,28,1609,4.420875420875421
