306584,3,6301031474,"Ace High is the second in a trilogy starring Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, directed by Guiseppe Colizzi. It is the best by far of the three films, although God Forgives.. I Don't (the first one) is also great.

In fact, the film begins where the last one leaves off and continues the adventure in a different direction. You don't have to have seen the first one to enjoy this, but it would be a good idea to release the previous film, if just to see a great performance by Frank Wolff as the villain.

Don't expect the usual Hill and Spencer antics (which can become a tad annoying at times)as this is a more sombre and serious affair. Hill is closer to Franco Nero in terms of performance.

But Eli Wallach is the star here, although he is essentially playing ""the Ugly"" again. He is funny, bright and moving.

A few more extras might not have gone amiss though.",1190764800,6,863,4.375
306585,2,6301031474,This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times.  It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties.  Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after?  The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't.  What a shame!!!  It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!!  Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't.,1157932800,7,468,4.32183908045977
306586,4,6301031474,"Cacopolus, played by Eli Wallach, is easily the best Western anti-hero to grace the silver screen. His dry wit, and useful sayings his ""grandfather used to say"" make him constant comic relief. Two friends rob a bank, and head out of town with their money, little do they know that their about to be duped by Cacopolus, an outlaw who know his way around money, and redefines the word ""money laundering"". After being robbed the duo seek out their mustached theif, following the trail of good deeds Cacopolus does throughout the country side, with their money!",1113955200,8,557,4.8125
306587,1,6301031474,"Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film.",1091750400,25,791,5.092307692307692
306588,5,6301031474,"I like this film very much, but when are they going to put the three ""Sabata"" films on VHS or DVD? Lee Van Cleef made the first and third. Yul Brynner made the second Sabata and in some ways was the best. ""Ace High"" is a good film from the same mold of Leone's trilogy. Yet ""Ace High,"" ""Sabata,"" ""Death Rides a Horse"" and others look second rate though in the same genre. Terence Hill however does bring ""Ace High"" up one notch the more I think about it.",972777600,9,454,4.112359550561798

306672,4,6301031474,"This is a 1968 western.  2 guys, Cat & Hutch, have all their money (approx. $300,000)  stolen by a man by the name of Cacopoulos.  Naturally, Cat & Hutch want their money back.  But when they catch up with Cacopoulos the money is all gone and in short the most expedient way to get their cash back is to team up with him.  I won't go into details why this is the case but the efforts of the 2 men is complicated because Cacopoulos has his own vendetta going on which is why he stole the $300K in the first.  All in all I liked this movie and the offbeat sense of humor it has.  That is not to say  this is a comedy, but there are humorous moments.",1465776000,,647,3.9612403100775193

306675,3,6301031474,"Although notable for the usual dagger-sharp performance from Eli Wallach, the interesting and likable role played by Brock Peters, and the ever-charming ruffian duo of Hill and Spencer, this one doesn't quite move me.  For one thing, part of Terence Hill's charm lies in his soft, teasing, infinitely sarcastic voice--and here he's dubbed by some annoyingly same tough-guy voice actor who makes me want to put that part of the dialogue on mute and subtitles only.  Meanwhile, the plot is . . . well, semi-interesting.  Amusing here and there, yes.  Plenty of action--goes without saying.  But it lacks the comic soul and the ""noble ignoramus"" feeling of Trinity and a few other Hill/Spencer outings, that undefinable Puck-goes-West spirit that simply can't be replaced.  So, if you're a Wallach fan, you may want to buy this for your collection, as Eli was a truly great and underrated actor and doesn't fail us here.  Beyond that, well, it was kind of fun to watch--once only.",1464652800,2,977,4.957055214723926

307058,5,6301031474,"Ace High is an excellent film, but only if you like the genre of late 60s spaghetti westerns. Note that this is a serious western with some occasional comedic moments and much wry irony. The story is somewhat fantastical and exaggerated beyond reality, but Ace High is NOT a parody-comedy like the subsequent Trinity films that also starred Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer. So if you're looking for yucks, youll be disappointed. Ace High is a film that VERY STRONGLY borrows from The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. Eli Wallach plays nearly the same character in both films, and in both films he adroitly steals scenes with biting comedy-pathos. In Ace High, when Eli Wallach is on the screen, just when you want to smile, you shed a tear... and just when you want to spit with disgust, you find yourself smiling. And of course, the film delivers everything else you expect in a first class spaghetti western. All the dialog is looped. Mouths move one way and words come another way. Lots of beautiful exteriors. Plenty of dust, sweat, and grit in tight shots. A lot of senseless death. Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer refine the buddy act that theyll use to such great effect in later films. Ace High is a complete joy to watch. But remember, youll be disappointed if you expect a comedy. This is a serious film with much dark irony.",1426809600,11,1326,4.59915611814346

307107,5,6301031474,"I give this 5 stars because its endearing to me. It reminds me of good times spent with my step father who introduced me to Terence Hill & Bud Spencer spaghetti westerns & comedy's. For me this movie sets up ""Boot Hill"" as a sequel to ""Ace High"", I know they weren't meant to be but they work well when watched in that order. If you take the Bud Spencer Terence Hill movies to serious you will be disappointed if your looking for some light hearted western comedy then you will find it here. Terence Hill's break through movie that set up the duo of him & Bud didn't even have Bud Spencer in it. There are two types of Spaghetti westerns the high end type like ""Once upon a time in the West"" & the man with no name trilogy starring Clint Eastwood ""A fist full of Dollars"", For a few dollars more & The Good, the Bad & the Ugly"". Then you have ""My Name is Nobody"" starring Henry Fonda & Terence Hill which is a mixture of the high end Spaghetti western & the light hearted sequels that followed. ""Ace High"" is a strange middle ground between the high end Spaghetti western & the light hearted ""Trinity"" sequel's & the other Bud Spencer Terrence Hill collaborations, most of which are great fun if your not expecting greatness in the movie. If your looking for a hard core great western don't look here. If your a fan of Terence Hill & Bud Spencer movies then you know what to expect & will probably enjoy ""Ace High"" because if you are a fan of these two guy's zany brand of comedy your not an armchair critic & will forgive the loose direction & production value for a bit of escapist western fun. If you are a armchair critic you probably aren't even reading this & wouldn't be able to sit through this movie let alone have fun with it.",1418428800,2,1736,4.263636363636364
