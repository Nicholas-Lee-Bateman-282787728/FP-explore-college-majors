The over all production is well done, but the content fell far short of what I was expecting. This video was not worth the money.",1286150400,,284,4.181818181818182
8666006,3,B000WC3A9E,"Let me begin by saying that the quality of the models in this DVD is as good as it gets. Five stars on that point by itself.

However, what they do with them is incredibly disappointing. Peach tends to be all over the map when it comes to these productions and this is one of the biggest letdowns, because there was so much potential. The directing here is awful. there are about six or eight different women who appear in pairs in several different vignettes. But every single vignette looks exactly the same: all of the same angles in basically the same locations, blocking is the same (with one woman close to the camera and the other in the background), the models even dance the exact same way in every vignette.

The director also relies on the same dumb shots when the women disrobe from their bikinis. For  some reason, over and over again we see them--I don't know how else to say this--floss themselves with their thongs. And I'm not talking about their teeth. Seriously, is that sexy at all?  and couldn't we at least have seen it maybe just once or twice? I'm guessing that it must be a fetish that the director has because I swear you see the same stupid shot of that from every model in nearly every vignette.

I also was mightily chagrined by the lack of graphic nudity. The women take off their bikinis almost immediately, dance around  in a really stupid-looking way (aren't South American women supposed to be able to dance??? not these!), and then three minutes later walk away from the camera. That's what we see in every single solitary vignette. The camera position never really changes much. So we have these incredibly hot fully-nude women, but we don't get a lot of nice tight close-ups, or  low angles in the intimate areas. I have seen Peach DVDs that showed a ton of explicit nudity and I've seen a ton that show almost none, and this one  is closer to none. There are maybe two lingering shots of the Promised Land but I was hoping for much more--especially considering that this DVD is an hour and 20 minutes long.

That's another thing: For what it is, this vid is just too darned long. If we were seeing something different with each vignette it would have been different. But there was no inspiration here at all, a lot of the same shots over and over again, hum-drum, hum-drum. It literally put me nearly to sleep.

Part of the reason why the run time is so long is because the director tried to get artsy with a lot of slo-mo footage. This is nearly always a throwaway. I can't figure out why somebody doesn't inform the directors of these kind of videos that this is a complete waste. My guess is that they use it to increase the run time artificially. It is done here so frequently that I  watched the second half of the DVD in fast forward. I mean heck, what they were showing us wasn't even good at normal speed...why show it in super slow motion?

All that we really  need you to do is to so us everything from revealing angles and positions. Try being more creative in your shooting, and spend less time showing off your creativity in post-production!",1285977600,,3092,4.480427046263345
