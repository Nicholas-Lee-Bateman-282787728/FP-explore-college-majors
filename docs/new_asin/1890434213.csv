7801013,5,1890434213,Death of the Dream is beautifully done - the photography and the music are so appropriate to the subject matter.  This is well worth seeing by anyone who loves mid-west history.,1408665600,,177,4.709677419354839
7801014,5,1890434213,"I could hardly believe finding this book, as I have spent many an hour driving through the countryside and looking at the forgotten old houses - and better still, I am from Big Stone County.  I'd give much to know just where that little family cemetery shown on the last page is located. Last summer my sister drove from Kansas and I from Washington and met up back ""home"" in Big Stone County.  An aunt and uncle took us around to several little country cemeteries where we have great- great grandparents buried.  We did visit the Prior Township house our dad grew up in - now deserted and looking very much like the interiors of the houses in the book. We  reminisced  about stories our dad had told us about all eight boys sleeping in the big low-ceilinged bedroom upstairs where Grandpa sometimes stored his seed corn and the little shed that the boys would slide off into piles of snow and get scolded for.
The black and white photos are beautiful and heartbreaking - the houses, the graves, the desolate snow-covered fields. I should think that anyone from the prairie who enjoys history would really enjoy this book.",1405296000,,1122,4.618090452261306
7801015,5,1890434213,"This is an amazing book about the old farmhouses!  The book specifically focuses on the houses in Minnesota, but anyone who wants to know about farmhouses will love this book!  I live in an old house in Michigan, and many of the descriptions fit my house to a ""T!""  I have learned a lot, and I am thrilled to death with this book!",1327708800,,330,4.2063492063492065
