8229351,4,B000XSKDOC,"Disappointed that this edition didn't play on my DVD player.
However the images and scenes had a wonderful gore to them
The low tech filming technique helped make the footage appear as a actual real.
Overall well done for this surprising piece",1387670400,,243,4.809523809523809
8229352,1,B000XSKDOC,"Half this movie is shot as though the director were partaking in the same substances his characters indulge in.  The other half is spent trying to figure out the cockamamie narrative that makes no sense whatsoever.  Nothing about this movie is engaging for long.  We are given characters, even a bisexual femme fatale, but their antics are so constantly over the top throughout the film that the shock value and initial interest evaporate all too quickly.  Does this movie tell a tale?  Well, up to the conclusion of the Thailand sequence, the story almost holds together and makes sense as we track down a cursed painting along with our art historial/deal main character.  Then the last half hour plays out as if the writer/director had run out of story material and was just looking for scenes to fill the movie with so he could get credit and money for having shot a full length film.  Don't waste the full length time seeing it.",1309824000,,932,4.680981595092025
8229353,1,B000XSKDOC,"the First thing you will notice when watching this movie is that it feels like it was filmed by a student film maker with a camcorder. The lighting is generally bad. Most of the film is shot in darkened scenes so you can't really get a clear picture. The second thing you'll notice is that the director was probably drinking a fair bit. It jumps all over the place trying to be weird but comes off more as amateurish. Think Twin Peaks but done by high school kids. As for nudity and such, don't bet on much of that. Its mostly a lame mystery of a couple of people searching for a lost artist. Not much happens in the movie. As I'm writing this I'm half way into the movie so unless the second half happens to have a great turn around I wouldn't recommend it. seriously.
What can I say that is positive? well, I think the sound was good. And if this was made in as low of a budget as it appears to be in then I guess they did not bad for making a film for 1000$.
For a gore movie there isn't much gore. Not impressed.",1249603200,,1016,4.059701492537314
8229354,3,B000XSKDOC,"Nature Morte (Paul Burrows, 2006)

Nature Morte has everything--a compelling script, gorgeous locations, one of the better soundtracks I've heard in recent years (composed by Steven Severin of Siouxsie and the Banshees), girl-on-girl action that's hotter than anything you're likely to find in any softcore and most hardcore films, an always-surprising mystery angle, some passable gore... yep, it's got everything. Everything, that is, except for the talent needed to pull all this together in what could have been the best erotic thriller of the decade, not to mention the first true erotic thriller/gore film crossover. So many possibilities, all so deliciously close to the surface.

The main thread of the film has to do with an art historian, Oliver Davenport (Killing Time 24/7's Troy McFadden), who's an expert on a deceased artist believed to have been a serial killer known as the Marseilles Monster. When a new painting turns up that could only have been painted by the artist after his death, Davenport and French policeman Georges (Jeso Vial) head to a small island off the coast of Thailand to find out if, perhaps, the Marseilles Monster had an accomplice.

It's great stuff, and as the film progresses, it gets greater and greater, with the exception of one thing--the acting. Troy McFadden was about as wrong a choice as one could have come up with to play Davenport (okay, it's possible Ron Jeremy would have been less appropriate, but that's arguable); his delivery is not so much wooden as it is sheet metal, one note that's in a constant state of shimmer. And really, if not for McFadden, I think this movie would likely have gotten a much better reception than it has. Really, there's not a single other thing wrong with this movie. I grant you, it takes a little more attention than most films of this stripe take, which I'm sure some people had a problem with. If you follow it, though, the reward at the end is more than worth it. I just wish a bit more care had been taken with casting the lead role. ***",1233964800,2,2030,4.7942857142857145
8229355,5,B000XSKDOC,"Here's a movie that stands out from the pile of low budget productions I usually watch. The story is thought-provoking, the cinematography is daring and very very stylized, the sexy scenes are... super sexy, in particular the sapphic one illuminated only by thunder:)The score is by an ex-member of my favourite bands ever (Siouxsie and the Banshees), which was a bonus! For a first movie, I have to take my hat off to Paul Burrows, shame the marketing of the movie seems to concentrate on the slasher elements rather than the Noir genre Nature Morte definitely belongs to (and the movie's website certainly reflects this). I believe that if you watch it expecting another Hostel movie, you'll be disappointed, but don't dismiss it if you like a good psychological thriller or are a fan of Giallos, like me!",1208822400,2,807,4.855072463768116
8229356,1,B000XSKDOC,"This was a terribly executed movie on many fronts.  The actors were not convincing and the script not well written.  But the worst part was the terrible cinemetography. It appears that the director was attempting to make an experimental-type film through the use of different lenses and effects.  But all this did was make it difficult to see what was happening and distracted the viewer from the already disjointed storyline.  Two thumbs down, way down!!!",1208736000,3,456,5.04
8229357,2,B000XSKDOC,"This was disappointing on several fronts. From the DVD cover and Amazon reviews, I was happily expecting a horror-gore-exploitation film. It wasn't. If it was meant to be, then it fell far short. There is too little horror, gore, nudity or sex. My biggest bugbear however is the photography. It is too self-consciously ""arty"", filmed with dark filters throughout. Most of the film is unwatchably black. Visually, it looks ugly. People's faces are practically always in shadow. There seemed to be no lighting technician on the set. You can hardly see anything. Even the ""action"" sequences are filmed in near blackness. How can you enjoy horror, gore or sex when everything is black? It's exasperating to watch. To add to the steadily building frustration, is the stilted acting. Especially of the main character Oliver. I'm not sure if he intentionally meant to parody bad acting or if he was really just a bad actor. To top it all of, there is the loud throbbing, syntho-pop music which I presume is meant to be menacing but is just downright annoying.

I actually liked the story itself. A series of apparent copy-cat serial killings take place in France and Thailand. An American art expert and a French cop go over to investigate. It is a variation of the classic novel, ""Picture of Dorian Gray"". In the movie, the central painting, purportedly a self-portrait of the killer, keeps changing, not to mirror the change in one man's twisted soul as in the book, but to indicate the identity of the person whose body has been taken over by the roving ""evil"" spirit that is the cause of all the killings. This ""evil"" flits from person to person turning the one it possesses into serial killers all with the same modus operandi. They torture and kill their victims while immortalising their death throes on canvas. Very promising material. Sadly not realised.

The only gore I could make out through the gloom were a few skin-deep slash marks on a victim's arm. There is a bit of nudity but you won't see much through all those filters. The victim with the bit-gag and blinkers (shown on the cover) was cute but her scene ended all too quickly and I couldn't make out what actually happened to her. All I know is that she died.

The film is also a sad waste of location shooting. After spending all that money travelling to France and Thailand, the cameraman slaps on so many weird filters that you can barely tell where you are through all the murk. Thailand is a land of brilliant sunshine and this film was supposedly shot on the famous Koh Samui resort island. I could not recognise it at all. I have never seen Thailand look so grey, drab and dull. Might as well have shot it in a studio decorated with a few palm trees. And just where in Thailand is there a French colony with people speaking French? The producers seem to mix up Thailand with French Indochina. All the French portions come with English subtitles burnt onto the print. No way to remove them.

The film is shot in 1.85:1 widescreen, letterboxed into a 4:3 standard frame (Non-Anamorphic). The picture quality is mediocre. All those artsy filters make the picture look flat and dead. I was squinting and straining to see what was happening all throughout. Totally annoying. There are 20 minutes worth of deleted scenes with director commentary. Those were pretty good. The bloopers reel was also fun. With hindsight I shouldn't have bought it. Worth a rental at most.",1206316800,13,3435,4.72
8229358,5,B000XSKDOC,"This is a great work of stylish film noir. It has an intriguing story line, bloody murders, eroticism and more than a few shocks. Everyone looks so damned cool on camera in the settings of Thailand, France and London. The film follows the work of a mad artist who likes to murder his models, work that keeps appearing after the artist's death - or so it seems. A French cop and American art expert try and find out the truth by following the source of the paintings to Thailand where there lives descend into a decadent world of drugs, debauchery and death. The supernatural slant is an added gem. I really enjoyed this independent film, a good example of its genre.",1205193600,4,666,4.512396694214876
8229359,4,B000XSKDOC,"I watch an awful lot of low budget exploitation stuff, to be honest 99% of them stink. Once in a blue moon, I watch something that is very good.  I thought this movie was great! It had the proper amount of nudity, with beautiful women. It had some very good gore scenes, although I would have preferred it be a bit more graphic. And most importantly, it had a great story! It's so rare to see a movie that combines all three, and does it well.",1201651200,17,443,4.151162790697675
