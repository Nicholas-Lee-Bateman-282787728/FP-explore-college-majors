8279773,1,B001AV0COM,"Unfortunately, due to the SELLER of this item, Preferred Products USA, I cannot rate the content of this DVD series. When we opened the outer box that contained the smaller DVD package we discovered that the DVD package had been opened and HALF of the 8 DVD's removed. Yep, Sessions 1-4 were missing. The shrink wrap was missing.  The paper sleeve that was supposed to house two separate DVD jackets, each jacket containing 4 DVD's, was not even around the one remaining jacket. It was simply lying in the larger box next to the one DVD jacket.",1516147200,,544,4.608247422680412

8279778,5,B001AV0COM,"The DVD lecture by Dr. Caroline Leaf is excellent.  I enjoyed the way she presented the material, and appreciated her 13 steps to detox the brain.  I've owned the set for several years and have watched it over and over, each time getting even more out of it.  Anyone who struggles with anxiety and/or depression, or knows someone who does, should get a copy.",1328918400,16,358,4.5625
8279779,5,B001AV0COM,"Understanding how thoughts are formed and that you can do something about the negatives ones that are keeping you from God's best for you is mind boggling - and Mind Renewing.
