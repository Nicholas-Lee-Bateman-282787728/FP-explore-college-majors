8549009,3,B0054SEQDK,"I think I had seen one episode of the seven before ordering this. Being a big fan of Peter Postlethwaite the wife and I sat down over a few nights and gave it a burl. Beka's call was that it was over scripted. Clever girl. There were elements of Shakespeare colliding with Lunon' crime family. A bit too much salt of the earth white people who were good natured people turning to the community business-crime. Some good writing lost amongst the dross of sentimentality. Some good cameos (Frank Finlay), some great moments (four naked, middle aged men sharing the shower-with one of them returning from the dead), some laughs but plenty of sighs and oh dear, please, no (the little girl finally acknowledges her dear father). Now Mr Postlethwaite was still the highlight. I just had to switch of the plot and watch the man act. Because he was one of our finest. He can certainly hold a stillness that great actors aspire to and loads of younger actors don't even know is a quality that can hold you spellbound waiting for the next move. Him leading the funeral procession at the end was worth the ticket price.",1347926400,,1109,4.606060606060606
