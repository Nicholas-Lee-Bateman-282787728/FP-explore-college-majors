This was a movie originally made for TV from what I have heard but was released to movie theatres as part of a double billing since it was better than expected. It is a good murder trial movie set in the west. It is a short movie but well worth the time to enjoy it. The cast is very good. JEFFREY HUNTER is EXCELLENT as the defense attorney Timothy Higgins. His reply to one of the ladies disgusted with some of the towns people is amusing and classical. Also character actor Preston Foster is good as the Judge and James Coburn as Boyd Palmer shows the promise that was to make him a big star in the future...""

FOR YOU, JEFFREY HUNTER FANS -- THIS IS A MUST-SEE, AS HE'S MATURING TO BECOME AN ACCOMPLISHED (e.g., Southern accent in ""Lure of the Wilderness,"" ""Call Me Mister""), COMEDIC, CHARACTER ACTOR.  BLACK/WHITE DOES DISSERVICE TO THIS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS, MULTI-TALENTED, UBER-DECENT HUMAN BEING-CUM-ACTOR & HIS GETUP HERE.

"" 'A symphony of sex appeal, talent and personality.'
  That's how Modern Screen reporter Arthur Charles
  and most reporters of the 1950s and 60s described
  Milwaukee raised actor Jeffrey Hunter.
  Hunter was a stunning combination of intelligence, versatility,
  compassion, athleticism, and humility -- all wrapped into a set
  of perhaps the most penetrating blue eyes Hollywood has ever
  seen.""

Review:
""Sam's Lawyer Son
31 January 2007 | by bkoganbing (Buffalo, New York) -
Temple Houston was born in 1860 and was only three years old when his legendary father Sam Houston died. Sam was married briefly as a young man to a woman named Liza Allen and while he was Governor of Tennessee they did the unheard of thing back in the day of divorcing. So unheard of that he resigned being governor and went to live with the Cherokee.
After Texas gave him a rebirth in a political career, Houston married Margaret Lea of Alabama and had a flock of kids with her. Margaret was considerably younger than Sam. Their next to last was Temple Lea Houston.
Though he never made any impact politically like his father did, Temple was one colorful character in the old west of Texas. He was a frontier trial lawyer, one of the best. And adding to that he had a reputation as a dead shot with either rifle or pistol.
Lawyer/Gunfighter, it sounds like something Hollywood would have invented, but Temple Houston was for real. And for the 1963-1964 season he came to us in our living room with Jeffrey Hunter in the title role.
The show lasted one season. I suspect the reason it was canceled was because Texas was in the shade that year due to a very famous homicide that took place in Texas just as this show was finding an audience.
That's a pity because Temple Houston was one of those larger than life characters that need to be told about. Jeffrey Hunter did a fine job in the title role.
The real Temple Houston was only 45 when he died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1905. He probably would have liked what Jeff Hunter did with his character. I know I did""",1347667200,4,3289,4.637931034482759
