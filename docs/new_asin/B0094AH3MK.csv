The dvd played great.",1460073600,,158,4.3
8535747,5,B0094AH3MK,"This performance convinces from start. It comes from the tiny operahouse in Busetto, near Verdi's farmhouse in Sant'Agata. With modern technique and camera angles, you get the impression of a much bigger scene. The stage director Pierfrancesco Maestrini, and the designer of the sets and costumes, Carlo Savi, have made ecellent jobs. As for the singers, I find them very good, especially Giovanni Battista Parodi, who sings the title role, but also Sebastian Catana (Ezio) and Susanna Brachini (Odabella) are good. You won't be disappointed here.",1403222400,3,547,5.372093023255814
8535748,4,B0094AH3MK,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

My collection includes the 1991 performance with Samuel Ramey and Cheryl Studer and I thought it was time for an update with this blu-ray.

Picture is fine. The background is projected, which makes the small stage brighter and optically larger. I thought that was a good solution for a small stage.

Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1. Sound stage extents about half to the surrounds. Balance between voices, chorus and orchestra favors the voices a bit. They are coming from the center only. It is a performance with body microphones, so the voices are clear and the overall background noise level is low.
It's a small theater with about 300 seats. I don't think more than 10 musicians will fit in a row, so the orchestra and chorus are on the small side, but the orchestra is quite detailed and the chorus with about 12 male and female singers each is very precise.
Applause is on the weak side and more from the front than the sides.

I give it 4 stars overall for the audio, reserving 5 stars for recordings where the voices move with the singers.

Recording is credited to 4 persons including Paolo Berti and the Delirica Recording Studio (Fano), of which I was very critical in the Mose in Egitto performance. This recording shows that they can do a good job.

As for the performance, I liked it. The projection of the background works for me, the voices are all fine and the acting is a lot better than what was offered in Oberto performed in the same theater. It is still sung mostly to the front, but the principals seem alive and in tune with their roles. I liked the colorful costumes and warrior make-up, too. Singing is very good and the orchestra under a young conductor was fine for me.

Compared to the DVD from 1991, which has Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound: there is no comparison. Sound (and of course picture) in this blu-ray are so much better due to the 20-year progress in recording techniques that not even a Samuel Ramey, a Zancanaro or a Muti matter. The surround sound and the clarity in this recording will make it a fine replacement. I can recommend it.",1387324800,3,2512,4.54424778761062
8535749,3,B0094AH3MK,"Attila has had a mixed history after its premiere at the Fenice in Venice March 17, 1846. It was very popular throughout the Italian world at first. It is short, vividly dramatic, it's cardboard characters are all action and no depth; and it is eminently hummable. At the time of the Risorgimento (unification) of Italy it was a patriot paean with the lines of the Roman general Ezio to the conquering Attila that he is happy to let him have the rest of the world but leave Italy to me. (Avrai tu l'universo, resti I'Italia a me). These were fighting words in the 1840's for the Italians were fighting to free themselves from the Germans (Austrians) and the French. When unification had been accomplished and after 1860 it had lost it's moment in history and the opera was seldom done. Yet since the 1960s when there was a revival of interest in the early Verdi operas, particularly the ""galley"" group that he had churned out rapidly (like a galley slave) in order to make money and learn the trade, Attila has been one of the most popular. I have seen it in many productions including the Met, La Scala (with the greatest Attila of all: Samuel Ramey) and other houses in America and Europe.
A word about the play. Verdi had read a play by Zacharias Werner in 1808. The author was one of the furthest afield and wilder of the nascent German romantic poet movement. Even more so than Verdi's favorite of that era Frederick Schiller- progenitor of several of Verdi's operas. Werner's characters are the gods of light and darkness, the men, the battles etc of the Nordic Sagas. These will form into the Nibelungenlied that will be the fertile source of Wagner's epics. There is Valhalla, Woton (Wodan, Odin), Fricka, Fria, the Norns and Attila under the name of Ezil. He is sent as a scourge of God against the degenerate cities and peoples. His murderer is a Hildegonde, princess of Burgundy who also kills his young son before stabbing herself. The play is full of killings and destruction and all sorts of other excesses of the German Romantic movement. The plot of Werner's play also attracted other composers also. At the same time that Verdi's Attila was playing in Venice, an Opera by Malipiero based on the same play and calle ""Ildegonda di Borgogna"" was also playing at another theatre but was not well received. Verdi outsmarted the others here. In the prologue of his Attila he has the refugees of Attila's destruction of the city of Aquileia on the Adriatic Sea land on the islands that will become the city of Venice. In an added twist of this story, it appears that an earlier opera written by Farinelli in 1807 called Attila influenced if not inspired Werner's 1808 play.
The present production is to me unsatisfactory. Why try to cram it into the tiny (300 seats) theatre in Verdi's hometown of Busseto (recorded there October 2010).
It was written for the facilities at La Fenice which is a mid-sized theatre with adequate space for warring armies and choruses. The Busseto stage is barely big enough to set a dinner party for eight. Here the sets are projected and there is no attempt at ""theatre"". The costumes and makeup are horrid; something out of a grade B sci-fi movies. The only good job in the showing is the orchestra under conductor Andrea Battistoni. They are the stars of the show.
The singers are a mix of excellent and adequate. Here I must confess that I played this disc along with the 1991 DVD of the La Scala ""Attila"" with Ricardo Muti and starring Samuel Ramey, Giorgio Zancanaro, Cheryl Studer and Kaludi Kaludov.
By far the best opera singer in the present recording is the Ezio of Sebastian Catana; a true Verdi baritone. He sang as a seasoned veteran of many a top opera house. He knew just how to shade his voice to convey what ever meaning was needed. Susanna Brachini certainly has a large voice of good range and could develop into a substantial vocalist. She needs more training and in acting too. Robert De Biasio I know from several recordings. He has a sweet, lyric tenor that he lets wander sometimes but overall a quite good vocalist. The Attila of Giovanni Battista Parodi was adequate but not exciting. In a different role, say of a father figure, a Grand Inquisitor or a sage advisor he would be better cast, but not the leader of a horde of wild men.
Attila is certainly good Verdi, not as exciting as Ernani which I think is his best to this point in his career. His next, however, is a master piece - Macbeth",1376265600,2,4462,4.60678391959799
8535750,4,B0094AH3MK,"Everything has been said adequately and there is little to add. I think the video-graphics were inspired and give an evocative backdrop: the devastated countryside, the raging sea storm and the wonderful sunrise afterwards. I don't know which came first, this or Bill Viola's Tristan, an unbelievable artistic triumph I was lucky to witness. The problem here is the incongruity with the stage and the attempt to blend the two together.
One other thing is the ridiculous make up of the Huns. They look like some savage tribe escaped from Africa. Perhaps the esteemed designer should have studied Raphael's famed frescos. And that Jurassic Park helmet of Attila?  Don't insult the Huns, please. They kept Europe under firm control for nearly 200 years until they were beaten back by a conglomerate of armies at Capernaum (listen to Liszt's Hunnenschlacht symph. poem). Contrary to popular belief, they did not die out. There is a nucleus of people in Transylvania (szekely-s) that traces back their origins to Attila. The Magyars (Hungarians) are a sister nation to the Huns. Sorry for the digression.",1372204800,4,1099,5.105555555555555
8535751,3,B0094AH3MK,"By the time he came to write Attila for La Fenice in Venice in 1846, Verdi had firmly established, consolidated and refined a style and a structure that would be recognisable in nearly all his subsequent works. Attila is made up of a number of stock situations involving war, vengeance, romance and betrayal and Verdi packs it with big dramatic numbers and choruses that match the intensity of the emotions. There's nothing inspired here however, nothing that provides any great insights or revelations into the characters or human behaviour. Even worse, there are no great memorable arias or musical numbers.

Dramatically however there's never a dull moment in Attila. Much of the reason for that is down to Verdi's sense of arrangement and his scoring for a situation that appeals to the sentiments of a nation seeking its own independence. The qualities of Verdi's dramatic writing are all there then and the cast for this 2010 production of Attila at the Teatro Verdi di Busseto are more than capable of bringing them out. The theatre - seen previously in the 'Tutto Verdi' release of Oberto - has a tiny stage that you'd scarcely think capable of putting on a work as big and ambitious as this. The use of 3D-CG projections in Pier Francesco Maestrini's direction might not be the ideal solution, but it's a reasonable means of covering the epic settings of battlefields, ships, stormy seas, Roman camps and forest glades. It's a little cheesy, but probably no more so than painted backdrops, which would be the only other feasible option for a stage this size.

There's still not much room for the singers to do anything more than stand and belt out Verdi's big numbers, but the costumes, the stage directions and the performances all make reasonably good use of the limited resources. Occasionally, for no other reason than having no room to do anything else, the singers run off the stage and back on again to finish their number. The singing performances are mostly fine. If they lack some precision in places the voices are at least all more than big enough for the work and the size of the theatre. Giovanni Battista Parodi is a fine Attila, and if he doesn't particularly come to life, that's as much to do with Verdi's writing. Robert de Biasio has a classic Italian tenor voice for Foresto. He's not always on the note, but in the context of the live performance, it's fine and he makes a good overall impression. Susanna Branchini's technique could do with some refinement and doesn't have the smoothest legato, but she also gives Odabella all the force and character required. No problems however with Sebastian Catana, who makes a fine Ezio, but this is perhaps the only convincing character in the drama.

The Blu-ray here is part of C-Major's 'Tutto Verdi' collection. The quality of transfer is reasonably good. There's a little bit of flicker in the image but it's generally stable and detailed. The audio doesn't quite have the pristine clarity we expect from High Definition and there's very little surround presence on the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mix, but it's fine and it gets across the forceful delivery of the opera as conducted by Andrea Battistoni. The BD is all-region, BD25, with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Japanese subtitles.",1372118400,5,3308,4.882562277580071
8535752,4,B0094AH3MK,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this performance  First:the staging was both ingenious and functional, and most importantly, very atmospheric and evocative of the historical background of the drama. Early Verdi has been an acquired taste for me, after years of the mature operas, and definitely being, as I am,  of a Wagnerian bent. But now I am very pleased to get into these early Romantic Italian works. The singers were all more than adequate, even if the soprano and the tenor were a little over the top, and conversely, the Attila seemed just sllghtly undersung. No such criticism and be  made of the talented Sebastian Catana, the Ezio, who sang beautifully and elegantly, a voice, which I want to hear in the major Verdi roles.",1363046400,6,740,4.857142857142857
8535753,5,B0094AH3MK,"All the singers were great, the production was somehow kind of funny but it works. The conducting was impeccable. I was hoping that there will be a Bluray from the production at the Met led by Muti but there is none. So I am happy with this production.",1357862400,2,252,4.270833333333333
8535754,4,B0094AH3MK,"But the staging costs this otherwise superb Atilla one star. That's because it is done in the tiny (300 seats; 30 m stage) Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in the maestro's home town of Busetto. I have seen DVDs of performances there that worked, but this one, despite valiant efforts, does not quite make it. The stage director, to make up for the lack of spaces, projects computer graphics on a screen at the rear of the stage to create the sense of more space, as well as other effects. In the second scene in the Prologue, the Adriatic Lagoons, work very well when projected, but in other cases, the effect is less than effective.

Vocally and dramatically, though, this is one ""kick butt"" performance!

Bass Giovanni Battista Parodi is a very effective Attila, but he is no Sam Ramey, who owned this role for years (his La Scala performance with Cheryl Studer is available on DVD and is worth owning despite a so-so tenor). But after a bit of warming up, Parodi delivers the goods. (The helmet he wears in the first scene looks like the headgear of the alien in ""Predator"", though, which is a distraction)

So does Susanna Branchini, who is new to me, as Odabella. There is a visceral intensity to her portrayal, which suits the role to a ""T"". She is vocally secure from top to bottom and pulls of some very nice emotion in her duets with her squeeze, Foresto.

Roberto De Biasio is a hugely effective Foresto. Musically and dramatically he is the real deal, and has been such in every performance of his I have seen.

Sebastian Catana is a very good baritone who does a solid job bringinging Ezio to life. His aria in the prologue in which he tries to ally with Attila is especially well executed, with one of Verdi's best baritone phrases (Take the whole world, but leave Italy for me)being particularly effective.

Conductor Andrea Battistoni does an excellent job, fully realizing the score, in my opinion.

Of course, this is ""early Verdi"", which to me means tuneful and highly driven music which is very enjoyable, as far as I am concerned. And it is regional Italian opera upon which some frown ( but not I!) with less of a budget than the major opera houses have, with attendant quality differences in staging, costumes, etc.

I have no idea what goodies will pour forth from the DVD folks in 2013, the bicentennial of Verdi's birth, so there well may be an Atilla with a bigger budget. But there is something about the intensity of regional opera in Italy, particularly in Parma, which is in the heart of ""Verdi Country"" that does not translate to the urbane big city houses to which I relate. The audience here is not just happy with the performance, it is ecstatic, with all the screams, etc. that make this evident.

I really like this Atilla and wish that I could have given it that fifth star. But in fairness to you, gentle reader, full disclosure of good and bad is required.

Disc quality, both visual and sound (DTS) is first rate; subtitles abound.

I suspect that some Amazon sellers will get the price down in a bit; when that happens, I urge you to snap it up and post your reaction(s) as comments here.",1355875200,12,3119,4.561717352415027
