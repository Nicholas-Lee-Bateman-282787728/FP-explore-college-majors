958771,4,6304981848,"""No Looking Back"" is an uneven, but engaging movie.  Lauren Holly is luminescent as Claudia, a small-town waitress who gave up her dreams of a better life in the big city a long time ago. Now she's trapped  in a pointless relationship with Michael (Jon Bon Jovi-surprisingly good),  and her life is complicated when her old boyfriend, Charlie (Edward Burns)  returns to town. Lauren Holly's performance and Edward Burns' script really  bring Claudia to life.  There's a little bit of Claudia in everyone,  and  it's hard not to become involved.  The few dull spots are well worth the  feelings you'll get when you remember this movie.",915667200,2,634,4.89622641509434

958914,3,6304981848,"This is a simple story, well told, about a young woman named Claudia, played by Lauren Holly, who has been living for three years with one of her high-school classmates, Michael, played by Jon Bon Jovi.  Michael works two shifts at some menial job to make ends meet and Claudia works as a waitress at a small diner.  They live in some depressed area on the Atlantic Coast somewhere. Into their lives comes Charlie, played by Burns, who also wrote and directed the film.  He's tall, cool and sexy and makes even the good looking Michael look shabby.  It turns out that Charlie and Claudia were once an item until he suddenly left her.  Now, three years later, he's ""thought things over"" and wants her back.

For most of the film we see Claudia wavering back and forth between her undeniable attraction for Charlie and her loyalty to Michael and we wonder what she will choose.  There's a sub-plot involving her father who left her mother (played by the lovely Blythe Danner).

There is a lot of music and if you have the captions on you'll see the words across the screen, which are supposedly echoing the action.  A lot of Bruce Springsteen.

I didn't dislike the film. Burns is very charming and makes the screen light up when he's on it.  Bon Jovi comes across as a real sweetie but somehow born to loose.  The main dilemma is what Claudia will do and it takes an interesting actress to make us care.  I didn't think Lauren Holly did that.  She looks good, sort of how a waitress in a depressed town would look but her acting ability was mediocre.  Both her mother and sister showed more energy and generated more interest and sympathy from me. Michelle Williams would have nailed it.

I kept having the feeling that this film would have been much more interesting when it came out than it was now.  We've seen too many films in the past decade that treat similar themes in a much better way.  I think the director overplayed the mood.  We get it, from the opening scenes, shot with a blue filter that this was going to be a ""heartfelt, melancholy"" piece.  And then there's all this Springsteen music.  I think the film might be good for dreamy teen aged girls but most thinking adults are going to want a little bit more.",1381968000,,2224,4.482587064676617

958916,5,6304981848,"OK, I'll admit some bias here. Edward Burns is one of my all-time favorite filmakers. But this movie will hook you right from the start due to its wonderful cinematography. The colors and sights are thriling to behold. And Jon Bon Jovi proves he's no slouch in front of the camera.",1380672000,,281,4.529411764705882
958917,3,6304981848,"I generally like Ed Burns movies.  I especially wanted to like this one, since Jon Bon Jovi was one of the main characters.  Well, I discovered that there are some things that even Jon cannot save.  The characters are just not really likeable or understandable, and the setting is dreary and just as unlikeable.  Ed Burns' character is a slacker who somehow thinks his mere existence is sufficient reason for Lauren Holly (a tired waitress avoiding commitment) to abandon her relationship with Jon Bon Jovi (a factory worker pulling double shifts to make ends meet).  After they all graduated from high school together, Ed ditched Lauren.  Now she is with Jon, but she does not want to marry him because she sees it as a trap keeping her in the dreary town (in which no one has any money, but seem to be able to drinking bars quite frequently).  Ed has no plan for the future he wants to create with Lauren, but she seems be ok with that and considers (the most ridiculous part) leaving Jon.  Lauren struggles to find herself, etc., etc., but it's just such a dull path I couldn't even root for her.  Bottom line:  for a better Ed Burns movie, ""Brothers McMullen"" or ""She's the One""; for a better Jon Bon Jovi movie, ""Row Your Boat"" or ""the Leading Man"".",1369526400,2,1254,4.533333333333333
958918,5,6304981848,"One of Jon's best performances and he's had several, but they never seemed to get promoted very well. Get the word out, man. You are A VERY GOOD ACTOR. SHARE THAT FACT WITH ALL OF US!",1364774400,,183,4.111111111111111
958919,4,6304981848,I really enjoyed this movie and thought it should have done better in the box office than it did.  Lauren Holly was really good as the girl in the town that wants more than she has.  JBJ plays the guy without a clue.  There are enough of those out there.,1224547200,,254,4.04

958996,5,6304981848,"I have been reading some of the reviews on this movie and I agree with all who thought the film was great. I didn't see anything missing other than a good fistfight scene between Michael and Charlie once Michael knew he and Claudia spent the night together.

The cast did an excellent job and the town this movie was filmed in reminded me of home. I'm a native of NJ and having filmed this movie at one of the Jersey shores was very real in the fact that its cold and rainy alot of the time. Many of the scenes actualized how the day to day grind and ""comfortable"" feeling life can be at times. The characters depicted real choices we all have for a different, yet uncertain path or stay in the ""known"". The scene at the laundromat is exactly how they look back home and the row houses and even the town diners. Ed Burns is awesome and really put alot of thought into making this movie be as realistic as possible for the location he chose to film it in.

I adore Jon Bon Jovi and even met him at Seaside Heights, NJ many years ago before he was ever famous and he was sweet and talented then as he is now as an actor.

959003,5,6304981848,"I rented this movie on a whim because I had read about it ages upon ages ago on a Bruce Springsteen fanpage. I didn't expect to be blown away, but I sure was!
From the very first scene, where Sheryl Crow's ""Home"" is playing and they show all the places in the NY/NJ small town, I felt right 'at home'! I LOVED the song and the images may well have been of my own town! And the resonance of this movie didn't stop there!
I identified with Claudia (Lauren Holly) in so many ways. (although, I must say, ALL of the characters in this movie were stunningly acted and VERY true to life! I mean, these absolutely ARE the people I interact with everyday in my town!!!) But Claudia's attitudes, style, the way she was 97% ready to turn in her ""Born to Run"" fantasies for a decent blue-collar life, yet the way she needed to be free to be herself..... I found it all highly resonant! And I'm sure I'm not alone...
The relationship between Claudia and her mom and sister was very truthful to the small-town way, and while the characters were occasionally just a slight touch too 'Hollywood cliched', that is perfectly understandable because movie people are supposed to be larger than life, no matter what the film!
So anyway, I think Bon Jovi turned out a believable role (yet he was even better in ""Pay it Forward"" as an abusive father!) and Ed Burns was so totally that guy in high school who used to be ""the hottie"" and is now the listless drifter (aka loser!). Blythe Danner was terrific (esp. the scene on the front porch) and the girls who were Claudia's sister and friends were super too!!! And Susan May Pratt's small role was surprising and refreshing, too.
The storyline was excellent and really made me interested enough to worry about what the outcome of these people's lives would be (as is not always the case with movies (ex. ""High Fidelity"")). I won't decribe it in detail for the benefit of those who don't want me to spoil it, but sufficient to say, it's realistic (in a Hollywood way) and very engaging!
Whoever did the costumes and set design for this movie deserves a bonus! I love love LOVED how realistic they were (and I'm dying to find a shirt just like the one Claudia wore in the scene at the laundromat!), how they were stylish but very much the kind of thing young small-town people would wear! Fabulous!
And of course....the soundtrack! Absolutely superb!!! I would just like to say though, that the reason why they didn't release it is probabably because Bruce Springsteen has been known not to let his music be included on many compilation/soundtrack CDs. He didn't even put ""The River"" on the High Fidelity soundtrack and he even cameo-d in the movie!! So that is probably a big part of it.
Also, the only Patti Scialfa song that is currently available on CD is ""Rumble Doll"" (the song from when Charlie is driving her home) The others were on Patti's demo-tape type thing that she was working on for Columbia while she was touring w/ Bruce, etc, so you won't be able to find those songs anywhere els (sorry!).
But regardless of availability, wasn't the soundtrack a knockout!?! I've already mentioned, I LOVED ""Home"", and the Patti Scialfa songs, and Bruce Springsteen songs (One Step Up, Valentine's Day, and I'm on Fire)!
In fact, one of the ways in which I identified with Claudia was that she was a Bruce fan. Her serene, yet inwardly excited reaction when she hears ""One Step Up"" in the laudromat is SO me! But it's also the reaction of hundreds of small-town women when they hear Bruce Springsteen! (he's our blue-collar dreamboat, need I say more...!).
But seriously, No Looking Back was a phenomenal movie and I VERY highly recommend it to anyone who loves dramatic movies, great music, and wants to step inside the world of the northeastern small town!",1024790400,3,3786,4.5855457227138645
959004,5,6304981848,The dialogue and character interaction in this film is great!! Burns is such an excellent writer and his actors all play together beautifully! Jon Bon Jovi rocks in this film and proves he's a great actor!,1006473600,3,205,4.722222222222222
959094,3,6304981848,"I completely agree with many of the other reviews out there... the music is great and used beautifully in this movie to give the right feeling to the scenes.
The characters were very well acted, though I found it impossible to feel sympathy for Claudia during the scene where she and Michael break up.  I did, however, feel happy for her as she drove out of town to seek a new life that would captivate her imagination.  I think she did the right thing in staying with neither guy.
No Looking Back is basically about relationships and how they affect your inner self and what you want out of life.  In this movie, the main character, Claudia seems content in her life, but when an ex-boyfriend returns to town and seeks her out, she is reminded of her previous ambitions and dreams and this causes her to become dissatisfied with her life.
Interesting movie that is worth watching, though I find it to be pretty much forgettable(for me anyway).",998006400,3,944,4.57396449704142
959095,3,6304981848,"Edward Burn's earlier work ""The Brothers McMullen"" is fantastic and earns a five star recommendation.  It dealt with family members that were doing something with  their lives.  Those individuals exhibited both the virtues and moral failings commonly found in all human beings.  The three main characters in ""No Looking Back,""  though,  are trapped in their banal and frustrating circumstances because of laziness.  They have no one to blame but themselves for lacking ambition and settling for  mediocrity.
Lauren Holly plays the part of Claudia, a woman who is attracted to men who prefer drinking in bars and wasting time.  Charlie (Burns) has returned to the blue collar  hometown allegedly to patch things up with Claudia.  He is an extremely selfish male who manipulates women for his own satisfaction.  Charlie's lack of morality  even went so far as to have urged Claudia into.... My skin crawled whenever Burns appeared on the screen.  I  concede that far more evil people have existed on this planet, but hopefully the Charlies of the world are the exception and not the norm.  The character of Michael  portrayed by Jon Bon Jovi is also a weak man too cowardly to accept the challenges of life.  Am I being overly critical towards the lower classes?  Not at all, for I grew  up in similar circumstances.  The difference is that those desiring to set goals and achieve them left these neighborhoods as soon possible upon reaching their late  teens.  It is one thing if somebody lacks the native abilities to existentially choose a more rewarding life.  However, this trio of losers merely wants to earn enough  money to purchase their next six pack of beer and cigarettes.  The end of the movie has Claudia bravely setting out to improve her future prospects.  One can only hope that she is  successful.
The saving grace of this film is the dialogue provided by the very talented Burns.  I can only give ""No Looking Back"" three stars.  Most of us, if we are candid, have better things to do.",996883200,9,2001,4.834319526627219
959096,5,6304981848,"Claudia (Lauren Holly) has lived all her life in a small, seaside, blue-collar town, hanging out with the same group of friends since grade school. Now she's waiting tables in a greasy spoon to help support her mother. After three years together, her live-in boyfriend, Michael (Jon Bon Jovi), is eager to tie the knot. Their life together is comfortable and Michael loves her. But Claudia has dreams of life beyond her home town and is afraid that if she marries now, she'll never realize them.
Claudia's sister Kelly lives with her mother and struggles with good humor to care for her fatherless baby. Their mother hasn't left house since Claudia's dad walked out on the family six months ago. No one understands why Claudia sympathizes with her renegade father; like him, she has a wild, restless streak and longs for more. But she can't quite put her finger on what it is she wants.
So when her old flame, Charlie (Ed Burns), returns from out west, she begins to wondercmaybe he's an answer. Their past romance was a passionate one: He's the one that got away. But his California dreams have gone bust and he's back pumping gas just like he did in high school. At first Claudia resists Charlie, but he's got the lure of that first love you never quite get over and before long she finds herself back in his arms and agreeing to run off with him.
Without being told, Michael knows what's happened and forces the inevitable confrontation. But Claudia's confusion gives way to clarity: she just doesn't love Michael the way he wants and she's not sure Charlie is the answer either.

959098,5,6304981848,"What I liked most about this film is that it very accurately portrays the small mindedness that is too prevalent in much of our society today.  Of particular note are the local bar scenes and the dialogue that occurs  there.  Those scenes really underscore the fear of change and progression  that are keeping us from collectively becoming a more enlightened,  inclusive, and productive nation.
Along the way we are privy to watch the  characters motivations, hopes, perceptions, virtues, and limitations  unfold.  And they are a pleasure to watch.  I thought all the actors were  outstanding and that they really brought small town reality to  life.
Although I would not laud the beautiful Miss Holly as a great  actress, she has pretty consistently chosen to appear in particularly  relevant material and managed to give life to her characters.  Nonetheless  she delivers a very believable performance as a small town girl with big  dreams who has settled for a safe albeit unsatisfying existence.
Burns,  as always is comic, charming, and immature.  On the surface that is.  But  in some of his orations he displays a wisdom and logic that is undeniable.  It's a compelling mix.  But most noteworthy however are that his skills as  a director have grown leaps and bounds with this picture (in my opinion).  And that's not to say that I disliked any of his previous films.  Quite the  contrary.
His use of lighting.  His pacing.  The stills and the motion  shots.  Bravo.
In short, it's got a little of everything.  Drama, comedy,  some great music and perhaps most importantly this film really makes you  feel for the characters and it makes you think about your own  life.

The sountrack is simply amazing,  and I spent almost 1/2 hour trying to locate it on every internet site that  sells CD's, before I realized there was none. Whoever came up with the  brilliant decision not to release the sountrack should be taken out and  shot.
