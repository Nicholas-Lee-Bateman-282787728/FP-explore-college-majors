7964248,5,B000068MB1,"It's been mentioned again and again here that the range of styles is impressive and that many of the skate parts here just blow you away, but I'm surprised to see little mention of the editing on this video.  It's amazing visually from beginning to end and the flow between parts just keeps it moving--something a longer skate video really needs not to make it seem excessive by the end of an hour.  There are some editing and musical changes from the vhs version but I don't think it necessarily detracts from the overall effect of the video (sumner's part was the only real disappointment in that i think the original song by and you will know us by the trail of dead really added to it and kept with sumner's aggressive style but oh well).  The making of documentary is great and the other extras had no trouble keeping me glued to the screen.  Definitely worth buying!",1066435200,,872,4.5

7964250,5,B000068MB1,"This video is the best skate video of 2002.  The range in styles, variation of tricks, a little CKY-action, and great skaters.  Adio has one of the best teams with the exception of Shaun White on Hawk Shoes.  He should stick to snowboarding, that little red-headed...  Getting a little off topic, but it's true, anyway, great skate and skate great.
  Maybe i should get a job",1041984000,,375,4.606060606060606
7964251,5,B000068MB1,"Look, obviously the other reviewers of this film aren't skateboarders. I am. I've skated for years and have seen my fair share of skate videos, and let me tell you, this isn't a run-of-the-mill video. This video offers some exceptional skateboarding by the likes of Ed Selego, Kenny Anderson, Kris Marchovich, and the infamous Tony Hawk, as well as some comedy, provided by the ex-Jackass star, Bam Margera. The music and some of the language may not be appropriate for young viewers, but for any skater old enough and experienced enough to appreciate what's going on here, I think you'll agree that this is a great skate video. And you get your money's worth: I havn't seen the DVD version, but the VHS version is over an hour long, so, with the DVD version's bonus footage, you're getting a very long skate video in a very high quality format (considering most other skate videos are 20 minutes long, have terrible quality, are loaded with ads, have crappy music, and cost $30). Buy.",1037491200,4,985,4.732558139534884
7964252,5,B000068MB1,"This is by far the best skateboard video ever created. It has really good pros and ams like Richie Belton. The music is cool and not just rap (no rap at all). The effects are great and how it was all put together is great. Go out and buy this video, you'll love it!",1033084800,,265,3.925925925925926
7964253,5,B000068MB1,"wow! as i bought this dvd,i expected a skate film as usual,but after the first ten minutes, i couldn't stop watchin the very cool tricks bam margera and kenny anderson were doing.some not so usual tricks like half-flip casper,some kinda nollie over a parkdeck,an ollie over a porsche and a bs bluntslide down a 10feet rail were very interesting to watch,and tony hawk's part is supported by shaun white, a pro-snowboarder.if you want to see another kind of skating, get this dvd.you'll watch in more than only twice, trust me!!!",1032912000,,528,4.877777777777778
