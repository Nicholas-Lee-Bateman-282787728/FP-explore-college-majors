6129648,5,B00H369QJU,"What a fortunate find Dreams has been for working with my clients exiting the prison system. Lifestyle addicts struggle with limitations of finding employment, managing financial obligations on minimum wage incomes and overcoming the challenges of relapse into criminal behaviors. The undercurrents of the other story lines opened up dialogues in groups long after the viewing. I highly recommend tDreams for use in treatment facilities and counseling groups, nationwide. I look forward to exploring more of Joel Kapity and Chance Long collaborations in the future. Great work!",1398470400,,577,5.64367816091954
6129649,5,B00H369QJU,"Great method of showing devastating experiences that happens to our children. Children are a blessing and should be protected.
It also showed how mental pain, and hurt can be turned into a positive direction  channeled by the love of God through dancing.",1398470400,,254,5.0476190476190474
6129650,1,B00H369QJU,I cannot write a review because I did not see it. There is nothing else I can say about this movie. Don't know if I like it or not,1396656000,,130,3.5172413793103448

6129653,5,B00H369QJU,"The film starts out with a large number of subplots. The beginning is bogged down with question marks. Are these related? Will they come together? That seems to be a flashback, but whose? About 45 minutes into the film things start to come together. The film maker is showing us things on a number of levels, such as how our childhood influences our lives and can make our dreams difficult. Sometimes by not having a father, or worse having a non-supportive or abusive father.

We see a number of lives: ex-con, policeman, drug dealer, dancer, singer, boxer. Some are seeking stardom, some redemption, others forgiveness...but they all have a dream. And like some dreams, nightmares happen. Unlike the films of thi genre where everybody has a happy ending, this film dares to take on a gritty realism. Kudos.

Joel Kapity managed to do this film without explicit sex, nudity and cursing. 4 1/2 stars.",1392076800,4,900,4.837662337662338
6129654,5,B00H369QJU,"This movie is a must see for all ages.  The director shows his passion for filmmaking and directed an all star cast of individuals as well as some new comers.  The Movie is a must watch and I got my copy, make sure you get yours!!!",1391644800,,231,4.0

6129656,5,B00H369QJU,"This is one of those films that sticks with you. If you like captivating movies, this is a ""must see"" film. I was blown away by some of the performances of the actors. Everyone did a wonderful job. I was on a emotional ride the entire time. I can see why people compared the film to Color Purple or Precious.

6129658,4,B00H369QJU,"This movie will tug at your heart. A Christian film  that tackles sexual abuse, mental illness, broken homes and how the choices we make in life can affect us for a life time. Kudos to the young actors in this film, some of them played very compelling roles. Joshlyn Lomax appears in the flashback scenes as the younger Mia and nails it. I look forward to seeing her in more movies.",1441843200,,382,4.380281690140845

6129665,2,B00H369QJU,"I'm all for real life and realistic stories but this was a depressing film without a satisfactory resolution. I am not referring to a happy ending, but more in the sense of a satisfactory ending that covers all things brought up in the story.",1430092800,,242,4.5227272727272725

6129668,5,B00H369QJU,I was watching this movie as I wrote this review. I agree with one the the other reviews in that the writers managed to do this without explicit language or nudity. So kudos definitely to the writers and producers. I can relate to this movie on many aspects. It will be added to my collection. Perhaps counselors and troubled minds can watch and take something useful from this movie. I do have one question concerning the music in this movie. I've searched but was unable to find a soundtrack listing. Could anyone help me in this search?,1424304000,,539,4.56701030927835
6129669,5,B00H369QJU,"This is a very good movie, at first I was totally lost; because the movie is all over the place.  But after awhile, it really slows down.  As long as you grasp the stories of each individual early in the movie, the faster parts will not matter much; but it ties together in the later part of the movie.  I was highly impressed with this movie, and I will recommend it to anyone.  Just be patient with the movie, and grasp the stories of each character.  It took me a little while to grasp that the gym owner was the fourth character, but after grasping that it was a bit scattered; but it all tied together after awhile.  Great movie...",1421452800,,636,4.258333333333334

6129675,2,B00H369QJU,"BALANCE TO HAVE BETTER RATING AND GRAB THE AUDIENCE ATTENTION. THE MOVIE IS GOOD, ACTORS ARE ON POINT. THE SADDEN MESSAGE ARE IN THE SPOTLIGHT AND UNFORGETTABLE. A BALANCE TO BRING LAUGHTER THROUGH OUT THE MOVIE WOULD LEVEL THE WIPING OF PAINED TEARS AND BROKEN HEARTS INSTEAD OF TOO MUCH FOCUS ON SAD MEMORIES. THERE WERE TO MANY PIECES OF TORN PUZZLES WITHOUT THE SPACE TO FIT THEM. NOR ALLOTTED TIME FOR ACTOR EXPRESSION ON HAPPINESS TO GIVE AN BALANCED UNDERSTANDING AND A HAPPY ENDING.",1413072000,2,490,4.776470588235294

6129678,5,B00H369QJU,"For anyone that have ever experienced any of these situations. This story line gets you off your feet. Many times when you're abused as a child your future can be turned upside down. You can be filled with so much anger. Its sad that the perpetrator never seem to stop coming after you until Justice is given. You loose yourself some of us find talent but its so much anger built into it. This is a perfect story line for the sexually abused, the mentally and physical abused. A must see.",1407542400,,488,4.373626373626373

6129682,4,B00H369QJU,"This was a very interesting film. It deals with sexual and emotional abuse, incarceration, absentee dads and forgiveness, Several characters have to overcome the negative experiences in their lives in order to become successful and reach their dreams. The acting and directing is excellent. The film spent a little too much time depicting abuse. Not enough time was spent showing the characters once they overcame their obstacles at the end of the film. Only a few minutes were used to show the characters being happy while much of the film focused on showing these same characters suffering from abuse. This film would be rated PG-13. There is no sex, nudity or profanity. There are two scenes of violence and several disturbing scenes referring to emotional and sexual abuse. I recommend this film for fans of independent dramas with an uplifting theme. The film has a positive message. You can overcome obstacles to achieve your dreams if you don't give up. Good advice.",1405555200,,973,5.012345679012346
