2591203,5,B000FUTV6E,"...well if you buy these separate they run at $19.99 to $24.99 a pop so you do the math.  This is a great buy for the price.  About the movies:

Burial Ground: not bad at all, the zombies look creepy, the atmosphere is creepy.  Not a bad zombie flick. 4/5

Zombie Holocaust: a gory gem.  Pretty graphic, nuff said. 4/5

Flesh Eater: horribly low budget, it sounds like it was dubbed even though it is in English.  It is extrememly cheesy, but has some really cool gory scenes. 3/5

Gets the five star treatment because it is basically a steal for the price.  Order from amazon, I was unable to track this set in any store so I ordered form here and received it in about three days.  No complaints here.",1166054400,11,702,4.282442748091603

2591205,4,B000FUTV6E,"Oh how I love Media-Blasters. They are putting out movies that time has forgotten. The Zombie Pack 2 includes Burial Ground and Zombie Holocaust both from Italy and Flesh Eater, which is American.

Burial Ground directed by Andrea Bianchi is the so bad that it's a great movie. If you like silly Italian horror flicks loaded with gore this one is for you. There is no plot at all. Just zombie killing people.

What I love about this movie is Peter Bark. He looks like a mini Dario Argento and easily has to be in his 20s or 30s and he is playing a child. And not only that, but his character Michael really likes his mother I'll leave it that.

Also from Italy is Zombie Holocaust directed by Marino Girolami. Though I have to question why they included Zombie Holocaust. It's more of a cannibal flick than a zombie movie. The zombies don't even kill anybody.

They show up making funny noises and scare away the cannibals, but regardless Zombie Holocaust is a fun film with some good gore scenes.

The highlight of the movie is when one guy jumps out a window; it's fairly obvious it's a dummy and when it hits the ground limbs go flying, yet when we cut down to him everything is still in place.

Finally we have the American movie Flesh Eater by S. William Hinzman best known as the zombie that chases after Barbara in the cemetery in the opening of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead.

Flesh Eater had potential to be a great bad movie, but while it has it's moments just not enough. Once the main characters are killed off zombies just roam around killing people. Sounds great right? Yeah I thought that as well, but trust me it gets old. It's the same scene over and over again for a good 40-min or so.

All 3 movies on the Zombie Pack 2 are quite fun with Burial Ground being the best of the trio.

Like the first Zombie Pack you aren't getting the best horror flicks out there, but for those who love trashy cult cinema (and if you are reading this I'm sure you are a fan) you get some really fun movies.

All 3 of the movies on the Zombie Pack 2 go for a little over $20 each, but with the set you get all 3 for about $20. Even if you only wanted 1 movie from the set it pays to buy the set.

Thank you Media-Blasters for putting out these cult classics.

2591208,5,B000FUTV6E,"There are lots of great 80's zombie-cannibal movies out there and this is certainly one of them, a gem of a movie that has a great story that combines all the best elements of the 80's into one, you have cannibals, zombies, mad human experiments, plenty of nudity and gruesome gore!! The story starts out with doctors investigating body parts going missing from the hospital, it leads them to believe the mysterious people involved are linked to a cannibalistic island, on visiting the island to further their beliefs they discover things more shocking than they could possibly imagine, the movie does have a great cast of actors and actresses, notably the beautiful Alexandra Delli Colli who is no stranger to full nudity in this movie much like Ursula Andress did in mountain of the cannibal god, the practical effects budget is marvellous, glorious blood and guts and gore and plenty of it, (CERTAINLY UNCUT) this movie is really well made and stands out from other movies of its kind I think, if you love these old cannibal movies then certainly check this out, the new 88-films Blu-ray release is great value for money.

Blu-ray picture is very slightly grainy but looks fantastic compared to DVD, (1080pHD)
Features are great, you get a feature length documentary called Eaten Alive which delves deep into the phenomenon of the late cannibal movies with interviews with directors etc, running time 85-minutes,

2591209,4,B000FUTV6E,"Shriek Show re-released three of their cheesy 80's horror movies in a single DVD case. Each movie has their own separate DVD. I believe they are the exact same DVDs as the single releases that Shriek Show did with each one before. All three movies are very low budget horror movies from the 80's that vary in entertainment (at least to me). The best one had to be Burial Ground, while the very worst one was Flesh Eater. The movies are all presented well though. They each have a wide amount of special features. The price for these movies was great, and since Shriek Show has closed their doors, because Media Blasters seem to be on their very last legs, all Shriek Show DVDs are out of print. Some of their releases have already gone up in prices. Best to get them while you still can, BUT I give you ONE warning. I've heard that Shriek Show releases seem to go ""bad"". I've heard of people on forums saying that their Shriek Show dvds stopped working after watching them only a few times, or that they break easily.

2591220,3,B000FUTV6E,"Back in February, I bought some Zombie flicks. We had a big snow storm that got me out of school for quite a few days, so I watched these. I only liked one of these;

Zombie Holocaust- Once again, another movie that doesn't satisfy in what I look for in a zombie film. There are some good nude scenes with a hot girl, but there are hardly any zombies at all. Don't watch this movie!

Burial Ground- This zombie movie is just okay. Some parts are kind of boring. There are some good gore scenes. The story is about some people staying at a mansion, then zombies turn up to eat them. There is a love story about a kid who wants to make sweet passionate love with his mom. So if you are fans of gore, zombies, and incest, then you'll probably like it!

FleshEater- I love this Zombie movie, not only because it's a Zombie flick, but it's a Zombie flick that takes place on HALLOWEEN, which is awesome!!! It has gore, female nudity, zombies, HALLOWEEN...what else could you possibly ask for in a horror flick! I knew how it would end because I'm so smart! The lead zombie is the cemetery zombie from George A. Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead! If you love horror, zombies, and HALLOWEEN, you'll love FLESHEATER (a.k.a.)

2591221,3,B000FUTV6E,"The best part about Media Blasters release of the ""Zombie Pack part 2"" is the price.
I bought this at a best buy for under fifteen bucks,and can't complain,as the company delivers good,quality prints to even the worst films.
And boy are these bad.

If your a gorehound and/or a zombie enthusiast,than by all means,check this set out.
Most others should run away.

Three films are packaged within this set,and are as follows:

Burial Ground(1980)-One of the most notorious Italian gore films ever made,features some terrific looking zombies and nice atmosphere,but almost no character development or much of a story.

It is,however,unintentionally funny.

The ""child"" in the film is actually a young man in his early 20s with bad make-up on(!),whose sole purpose is to have an incestous relationship with his stacked mother!

The most famous scene is the one where the child turned zombie sucks on one of his mom's big breasts and decides to bite!
OUCH!

Not a good film.

Zombie Holocaust(1980)-With a title like that....how can you go wrong!?
Actually it's a pretty uninvolving gore piece,originally titled the much cooler,""Dr Butcher M.D"" and is a grindhouse favorite.

The idea was to combine the Italian zombie film with the Italian Cannibal film,except with less than stellar results.

There's some nice nudity,Ian Mcculloch from Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" is in it,and it's pretty gory,too.

Ain't much of a plot:Cannibal cult loose in New York City.
Doctors trace cult to island,encounter zombies and mad doctor,become experiments.

Mediocre at best.

Flesh Eater(1987)-The third film in the set,and the only American made one,is also the worst.

Bill Hinzman,who portrayed the ""graveyeard zombie"" in Night of the Living Dead(1968),directs and stars in his own zombie epic!

He portrays,basically the same ghoul from Romero's film,except he's found buried in an ancient metal coffin(?) and wearing his best sunday clothes!
(Now considering,that the people in the movie believe this to be hundreds of years old,how does that account for his modern dress?).

The typical group of stupid kids decide to party in the woods(!) and get attacked by the ravenous zombie unleashed!

The gore is TERRIBLE and the acting is not much better.
There are no characters at all,just people waiting to get killed.
In fact,these kids make the ""Friday the 13th"" kids look like Brain Surgeons!

To add insult to injury,Hinzman steals entire scenes from Romero's film,including the siege in a farmhouse,the demise of the last surviving character and so on.
It also seems that Hinzman has transparently cast himself,as the groper of many a young babe's boobs!
Hmmmmmmmmmm.....sound like a great film to you?

Nothing to go crazy about here,but this set is fun viewing for a lost Saturday night,coupled with good friends,alcohol and junk food.

Have fun!",1228435200,2,2833,5.1982378854625555
2591222,3,B000FUTV6E,"Does having a female director make a difference in a zombie film? I don't know if all the credit can go to Andrea Bianchi, or if it really is a woman, as the IMDb lists her alternate names as A.Frank Drew White / Andrew M. White / Andrew White / Frank Drew White. Is it a man pretending to be a woman or a woman sometimes pretending to be a man? A mystery to explore.

What I do know is that if there were awards for zombie movies, Burial Ground would have been in the running for several.

The makeup and costuming for the original zombies was fantastic. Gruesome skeletons with worms crawling out of their eyeballs and period gowns. The gore was extreme.

The cinematography for the film was first rate. The set was beautiful and well lit and sumptuous. It was a refreshing change from barns and graveyards. The colors in the film reminded me of Almodovar. The blood was bright red and the other fluids were equally colorful.

There were real women in this film, not giddy teens. Real well-developed Italian beauties that were a delight to watch in the non-zombie scenes.

And, the characters were resourceful, brave, and knew that they could outrun the zombies. I get so tired of those that just stand there screaming until they are eaten.

It got a little kinky at the end as the son wanted to have a baby with his mother, but she quickly put a stop to that. Can you blame him? After all, he walks in earlier in the film and sees all she has to offer. Why wouldn't he want some? Alas, the poor boy does not survive in what appeared to be an almost suicidal moment.

But, this is a zombie film and Michael eventually suckles at mommy's enormous breasts and the efforts of the group are all in vain.

As to The Flesh eaters, You know they say that sometimes a movies is so bad, it's good. Well, I can assure you that this film does not meet that standard. The acting was so bad that it hurt. For what is rumored to be the first ""gore"" horror, it really disappoints with cheesy acting and a monster that is right out of Plan 9.

This film has a collection of weirdo, including a mad scientist (Martin Kosleck), a ridiculous beatnik (Ray Tudor), and an aging drunken has-been actress (Rita Morley).

It may be of interest in those who want to check out the oldies, or who are trying to get in the spirit of Halloween, but there are better films to do both.

If you like cannibal gore, then Zombie Holocaust has plenty of that. The zombies, created by the mad scientist, Donald O'Brien, don't really play much of a role until the end. There is one who gets his brains scrambled with an outboard motor earlier - cool! But, if you are looking for zombie tips to help you in next months zombie walk in Orlando, there is not much help.

The one thing I cannot figure is how Alexandra (who is definitely a natural blonde) managed to get off the sacrificial table just as the dagger was about to be plunged into her and lead the cannibals to destroy the zombies. It just happened - no explanation - you have to use your imagination.",1227484800,,3025,4.353463587921847

So far as the movies are concerned, we aren't talking Citizen Kane, obviously, but they're certainly fun for what they are, and well worth watching.
