4896198,4,B005UZNC9Q,"I've been waiting for years to see this, as a fan of obscure genre films.  The message is ham-fisted (as with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Running/dp/B00000FZQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Running</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soylent-Green/dp/B00009NHBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soylent Green</a>), the look is very 1970, and some odd soundtrack choices were made, but it's a bleak film about the collapse of civilization.  It can be viewed as exploitation, except that I find the story's premise completely plausible, and the violence gives depth to the plot and characters. With the notable exception of the scene with the biker gang, ""No Blade of Grass"" is closer in spirit to ""The Road"" rather than ""The Road Warrior.""

I've read that this is part of a ""survival"" trilogy in director Cornel Wilde's work, the other films being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Naked-Prey-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000XPSC0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Naked Prey (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beach-Red/dp/B00079ZABS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beach Red</a>.  In a technical sense, ""No Blade of Grass"" isn't the same quality as ""The Naked Prey,""  but Cornel Wilde is certainly a film maker with a strong message who can deliver it in a brisk plot.  Cast members Lynn Frederick and Nigel Davenport would reunite in 1974 for another serious (and also underrated) science-fiction film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phase-IV/dp/1606730266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phase IV</a>.

The DVD itself has no chapter stops or extras, but the presentation is letter boxed and the source print is good.  A trailer can be found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/42nd-Street-Forever-Vol-4/dp/B001J65RD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">42nd Street Forever Vol. 4</a>.",1327017600,19,2081,8.136563876651982
4896199,4,B005UZNC9Q,"Cornel Wilde directs a sleazy, apocalyptic road movie with heavyhanded ineptitude, but it's hard not to enjoy for it's casual violence and campy exploitation value. You'll thrill to: yummy buffets during televised footage of starving babies; cheating wives getting shot and wholesome ones being raped; practical fratricide; and, of course, reality-tv childbirth. 70's drive-in fare par excellance!
The dvd print is exceptional for a rarely-screened film from 1970.",1326240000,10,464,5.838235294117647
4896220,5,B005UZNC9Q,I saw it in the sixties and was shocked by the transformation of the family. I looked for the video for years after but it was never available until now. - great to see it again. Seems somewhat tame now given chances in film making and society over those intervening years but the environment disaster which seemed far fetched then is au current now,1442880000,,349,4.46875

4896225,5,B005UZNC9Q,"A sleeper film, this is a well conceived story of what might happen when society's infrastructure collapses - in this case from a tailored virus that attacks all the world's grain. Honestly only four stars except that it's so little known.",1421280000,,239,4.853658536585366
4896226,5,B005UZNC9Q,"Movie was made in 1970, in England and I was shocked/surprised how much the English censors let get thru. About half way thru it now and for me, this is a keeper. Takes place before the EPA really started doing their thing in America, so no idea what the English call theirs. Lots of polution shots showing how it was back then. Screwed up and some how ordered 2 of these, which worked out well as sending to Dad. It also gives everyone an idea what could happen if a grass destroying virus as mentioned in the movie did happen...and I'm not talking about grass on your lawn, but wheat, rice, etc. Food riots, etc. happen very quickly, then panic hitting the population in large cities when it is believed the English govt. is going to never gas about 1/2 of the population in the larger cities to make the food last longer. Bottom line: glad I bought it, keeping it.",1419552000,4,867,4.391304347826087
4896227,5,B005UZNC9Q,"I remembered this from my childhood and was never allowed to see it - too horrible I was told. All these years later and I finally made up for lost time. It is set at a time when the idea that global pollution was finally gaining traction as being a killer of the planet. Here we see that a cancer or virus is starting to kill all of the world's grass's. This is all plants from the grass family, wheat, rye, barley, rice etc. It starts in East Asia and India but soon the virus starts to spread to Europe.

John Custance (Nigel davenport - `Greystoke', `Chariots of Fire' etc) is an architect living in London with his wife and daughter. He has a brother living on a farm in the North of England and they are aware that things could go wrong if the government don't handle things well. The old adage that we are only three meals away from anarchy is uppermost in their minds. Then things escalate very quickly as the fabric of society unravels it soon becomes everyman and woman for themselves as mankind descends into a dog eat dog world.

John and his family try to make it to his brothers but face many an obstacle including, biker gangs, soldiers gone bad and a load of people hell bent on protecting their own - at all costs.

I absolutely loved this; filmed in 1970 everything was contemporary and so in many respects the first part is like a time capsule. The existential elements around the group and what we may do to survive are excellent. Some of the acting is a bit am dram. But Nigel Davenport always brings a gravitas to all his roles which saves nigh on every scene - even where it doesn't really need it. Wendy Richard also makes an early appearance as a lady of easy virtue. It was directed by the marvellous Cornel Wilde (`The Naked Prey') who also helped with the screenplay - which was adapted from the book by Sean Forestal. Some of the SFX show their age and some may judge parts of the on screen action, but I think this is a brilliant guilty pleasure. You can stream this from Amazon too and I think it is worth every penny - an absolute classic that ought to be preserved for the future.",1419033600,10,2113,4.317380352644836
4896228,1,B005UZNC9Q,"Trope-tastic, and ultra-obvious political messaging.
Not only is pollution causing all the grass and grain crops to die, they show you five to ten minutes of pollution just to make you disgusted though you really wish they'd just move on to the film. Then they show starving people in Africa and Asia juxtaposed with rich white Westerners eating. As if the lavish buffet with the TV of starving people isn't obvious enough, they have a dozen shots of starving kids then eating big cuts of meat.
Add to that poor cut-ins of a girl who says she wishes her boyfriend would make her a woman with scenes of her attempted rape by a gang and other poorly timed and weirdly lit cut-ins to contrast normal society versus decay of society, and this seems more like a political ad gone on too long than a post-apocolyptic movie.
Worst of all, I paid over ten dollars to watch this movie. I should have bought the book instead.",1415923200,7,915,4.551515151515152
4896229,5,B005UZNC9Q,"I was  surprised how believable this movie was. I am very familiar with apocalyptic stories. This has no special effects in it, just real people that had no skills to speak of, just determination and guns.",1412985600,,205,4.694444444444445
4896230,5,B005UZNC9Q,"This movie was way ahead of its time, considering how long ago it was made and what is going on in our world today.  I saw it when it first came out and I never forgot the movie and its message.  In our current age of genetically modified plants and viruses like Ebola spreading, it is truly a wake up call that this scenario is going to actually happen and it won't be just a movie.",1411948800,,383,4.026315789473684
4896231,5,B005UZNC9Q,"'No Blade of Grass' was a fairly early example of 'the end of the world!' type of science fiction. It was based on a good English novel. The story line is compelling; the acting quite good (Nigel Davenport is superb), the plot realistic once you accept the basic idea. I recently reread the novel and watched the movie: both are still good.",1400284800,,340,4.5
4896232,4,B005UZNC9Q,"Cornell Wilde's ""No Blade of Grass"" is a supposed adaptation of the Samuel Youd novel (which I have not read, yet) about a post-apocalyptic world in which grass is dead, and everything else that is living soon starts following the lead of the earth's green...this is a dark, impressionistic, somewhat bizarre movie. It has some nostalgic value to it, but the back cover of the DVD makes it sound like the picture will show a real bloodbath, when, in fact, the violent scenes are rather tame here. Wilde uses a ""flash forward"" style of cutting that seems to telegraph the tragedies that lie ahead, but this England-based thriller is more dense, dialogue-driven, and steadily paced than I thought it would be simply from observing the cover of the DVD. Wilde's other films that fit credibly into this trilogy of terror (the others being ""The Naked Prey"" and ""Beach Red"") are more action-driven than this title--there is plenty of gunplay and intense scenes, but they are rather light by our modern standards, and may not shock and revolt in the same way that they once did. However, you do get to see a live baby pulled from the bleeding and syrupy-looking ""area"" of a female on the operating table, and that right there is still pretty shocking to witness! Eeeck!
The Warner Archive DVD is distressingly bare-bones (again, sheesh), whereas an audio commentary would have made this a knockout (as the picture transfer is actually very good). I wonder what Youd (and the producers) thought about the finished film, but really a commentary track done by a British film historian would have been as valuable. It is perhaps wise that Wilde started to hang out behind the camera rather than in front of it (in his later career), as he further began to get out of his own way in his creative endeavors. Yet I think what the problem is here is that the script is too lax, and the genre out of Wilde's ultimate intellectual control. Nonetheless, its analysis of human nature is (sadly) spot on, and the ethics of the movie are far less preachy and obvious than the old ""Twilight Zone"" episodes. So, again, not an essential, but a pretty good finish to a very Wilde trilogy. B+",1395619200,6,2166,4.7026315789473685
4896233,1,B005UZNC9Q,I loved the book- one of the best ever in the post-apoc genre.  This film blew rabid monkey chunks in comparrison.

4896237,4,B005UZNC9Q,"Today British Science Fiction author John Christopher is best remembered for his juvenile Sci-Fi novels, notably The Tripods trilogy. But he was once one of the masters of British Sci-Fi apocalyptic novels and represented the missing link between John Wyndham and JG Ballard. The film, No Blade of Grass, is an adaptation of his novel The Death of Grass. The film, directed by Cornel Wilde is also a less sentimental British version of the American post-apocalyptic film Panic in Year Zero. With its ecological message, the film is still topical today. And its depiction of Britain's quick collapse into savagery as Nigel Davenport and his family make their way north to his brother's potato farm is very grim.",1368316800,4,710,5.02542372881356
4896238,4,B005UZNC9Q,Low budget but true to book in story content.  A bit disturbing as a film but enjoyable as a thought process for survival.,1362873600,,122,4.304347826086956
4896239,2,B005UZNC9Q,"This is one of those movies that sounds great on paper--then you finally get the chance to watch it and see that it was forgotten for a reason.  The story concerns a virus that wipes out all grain causing mass starvation and anarchy throughout the world.  It follows one family (including lovely Lynn Frederick from Vampire Circus) as they attempt to get out of the city to the safety of a family member's farm.  The film is certainly dark and angry and makes some strong points about the way some blithely over-consume while others starve and about the dangers of turning a blind eye to pollution going on all around us (although this was made in the days before the creation of the EPA and modern environmental laws).  It also paints a bleak picture of what humanity will resort to in order to survive and suggests that maybe we don't deserve to.  The problem is that director Cornel Wilde doesn't have the filmmaking chops to pull off what he is attempting.  The direction is clunky, particularly during the scenes involving violence which tend to be more sloppy than exciting.  To give just one example, early in the film the family is forced to kill two police officers to get through a road block and escape the city.  The violence is supposed to have an emotional impact--one of the characters vomits immediately afterwards.  But the scene is staged so poorly that it comes off more ridiculous than disturbing--and the stiff upper lip style observed by most of the actors is completely the opposite of what is needed to make the scene effective.  Imagine The Road Warrior made by a stodgy World War 2 era filmmaker and you will get a pretty good idea of what No Blade of Grass is like and exactly what's wrong with it.  It's a shame that a lot of these rare Warner Archive titles aren't available for rental or streaming because many of them definitely aren't worth watching more than once.",1331769600,8,1897,4.632835820895522

Wendy Richard (from Are You Being Served) is in the first half of the film, which was a very nice surprise, to bad they killed her off in the first half of the film, she has a great voice and was very cute.  Much of the acting in the film is not very good but it is still an enjoyable film.  One WARNING if you are sensitive to rape scenes, I would not advise watching this film.

Plot
When a virus from Asia infects plant life causing food stock to dry up causing a massive panic in London. John plans to get his family out of country before it's too late however he quickly learns if he doesn't fight back he'll die. With the help of a sharp shooter yet jerk Perry Andrews along with survivors John leads his group against savages, gangs, army and even his own brother.

I enjoyed watching this it kind of felt like early version of Mad Max crossed over with Solent Green only sent in Uk. However this film does have it's goofs like when Nigel shoots a woman they use a fake blood spatter camera effect I also felt it was goofy to show what was going to happen next while the screen flashes green & red. Overall I enjoyed the film and wish there were more post apocalyptic movies sent in UK.",1445040000,,861,4.3478260869565215
