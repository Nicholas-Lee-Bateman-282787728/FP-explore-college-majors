This was an Exelent movie for all ages. Come to think of it,  I don't think there was any curse words. There were some far fetched scenes but very kool. I am so glad I watched this movie. Played flawless. And it was in Full Screen Which I was hoping for . Soooo Happpppppyy !! The Original was the original, and this was this.

1391625,5,B000053W55,"I first caught the tail end of this by accident about a week or so ago while channel surfing and was immediately hooked because I have always loved blues and rhythm and blues.  I knew after watching the epic ending with all the Giants in Blues jamming at the Voodoo Witches mansion in Louisiana that it was a must own for me.  I was not disappointed.  Sure the plot is ridiculous, but that isn't the point, many of these legends like B.B. King and James Brown are no longer with us, so it was especially rewarding for me.  The choreography of the moves during most of these performances is also another treat and as far as I can say, there is a lot of eye candy in this film for anyone that loves Blues and R&B.",1467763200,,711,4.205882352941177

1391654,5,B000053W55,"The music and special effects are better than those in the original Blues Brothers movie, and the car crashes are even more ridiculous. I saw it in the theater. The musical gags are hilarious (Elwood dissing Blues Traveler, Johnny Lang working as a janitor for Wilson Picket and Eddie Floyd, and the discovery that the Blues Brothers' competition in the battle of the bands is an all superstar mega-group fronted by B.B. King and Eric Clapton).
I have only two criticisms. First, many of the musicians-turned-actors are stiff as boards in front of the camera. But in a way, this adds to the charm and authenticity of the movie. My other criticism is that the songs were obviously studio recorded and lip-synched. The trade-off is that the music sounds phenomenally good (and when you buy the sound track, as I did immediately after seeing the movie, you're getting exactly what you heard in the theater).
I have to admit that dedicating this film to the late James Belushi, John Candy and Cab Calloway mede me receptive from the start. So many of the characters from the first movie were present that it felt like old times The music made me buy the CD the next day; all the while thinking - what a dream roll for a kid! Also, knowing that this second film was written at the same time as the first helped me feel it was just like old times. Also, while looking for the original on video, I discovered that once the movie was in production, many of the people in the final act had requested to be part of the film. Is there any greater tribute to Dan",1453420800,,1550,4.5
1391655,4,B000053W55,"An interesting remake of the original.  I enjoyed it, but it lacked the reckless manic effect of the original.",1453420800,,110,4.7894736842105265
1391656,4,B000053W55,"The feelings I have for this movie is a bit of a mixed bag. See, I recall reading online somewhere that originally, Jim Belushi was to play the role of a new character, but apparently there were some issues and they had to change the script and include Joe Morton instead. This is an otherwise good movie, besides the kid; He ruins it. That, and the strip club scenes are a bit out of place. John Goodman does a good job at his role, but still; It isn't the same without John Belushi. Him and Aykroyd were inseperable. Overall, I think it's not the worst movie I've seen (the soundtrack is awesome, besides the last few songs that feature the kid) and it isn't as bad as people make it out to be, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first movie.",1452556800,,745,4.216783216783217

I gave it 4 stars because the movie was good and it is the same director John Landis he is the best director in the world! good movie but no John Belushi 4 stars thank you Amazon.com for my package it got here a little fast but could be faster but that's okay good movie and good price I would buy stuff on Amazon again again I love shopping online I will watch this movie again again with my family. Good job Dan Aykroyd and director John Landis for doing a blues brothers sequel called Blues Brothers 2000 I love this movie and the music! John Goodman is so funny when he plays Mighty Mack Mcteer. The whole blues band is good including Matt Guitar Murphy, Blue Lou Morini, Marph and the magic tones, and many more... I just think the whole blues brothers sequel movie is all funny and good music. Just good ole time of on a second mission for blues band success!!! I love you Blues brothers band and Dan Aykroyd I love your music! The blues brothers 2000 is the worlds best movie in the whole universe but not a musical it is still the best movie of my life time go blues brothers. The blues are back  go Elwood your the best. This is definitely a 4 star product I am sorry but it is not better than the original blues brothers movie but good music thanks bye!!!",1451692800,,1555,4.1490066225165565

1391753,5,B000053W55,"Released in 1980, ""The Blues Brothers"" is a comedy/farce/musical starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as brothers who get their rhythm and blues band back together in order to raise $5000 to save the orphanage where they grew up. Carrie Fisher is on hand, as well as a lot of old musicians, like James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.

I found myself laughing throughout this movie, sometimes uproariously. The best parts are the Catholic orphanage scene, the black church sequence, the diner scene, the country bar episode and any part with Carrie Fisher trying to utterly annihilate Jake (Belushi) and anyone who just happens to be in his general vicinity.

For me, though, the film's a little bit overlong and should've been cut by about 15 minutes. For instance, they could've easily cut the music store scene since it's not as good as the other musical sequences, but then Ray Charles would've been cut. Nevertheless, this is a great comedy.

The film runs 133 minutes (extended cut 148 minutes) and was shot in the Chicago area.

GRADE: A- (or a weak 5/5 Stars)",1426982400,,1075,4.826086956521739

1391759,5,B000053W55,"Never saw the original, but I've managed just fine since first seeing this as a teenager.

Elwood Blues gets out of prison to learn that his brother and his mentor are both dead.  (I mean, really? They didn't tell Elwood his brother died?).  Seeking purpose to his new life of freedom, Elwood seeks out his mentor's secret son and gets tangled up with a smart-aleck orphan boy while evading the Russian mob, white separatists, law enforcement, and more in his quest to reunite his old band and win a music contest.

The music is great, and the cameos fun to watch (Aretha Franklin, to name one).

1391789,2,B000053W55,"I saw this film in the theater when it came out years ago. I just watched it again recently. I was very disappointed. It is obvious that they couldn't replace John Belushi. I wonder why they just didn't get Jim to fill in for his brother. There are some strippers in this film and they were out of place. There is a scene with phone sex operators. Why couldn't they be telemarketers? The film seemed to degrade women for no apparent reason. There is a scene where Riders of the Storm is performed and dead horsemen appear in the clouds riding on horses. Why? Is this an action comedy or a horror film? Aretha performs Respect once again. She has so many hit songs. Surely they could've found another song for her to sing. Then Erykah Badu appears as a voodoo priestess. This is ridiculous. She turns Aykroyd and Goodman into zombies. Are you kidding me? What happened here? The first film was known for great music,humor and elaborate chase scenes. This film could've been great but as it is, it sucked. Too many major changes from the flavor of the original film. The changes didn't improve the film. Strippers, dead horsemen, a voodoo priestess and zombies didn't help the movie. The movie would've been better if these changes were never made. More humor and  better constructed chase sequences would've made the film great. The musical performances are the best part of the film. Recommended for fans who enjoy good music and who just have to see the sequel.",1409875200,,1462,4.644787644787645

The film started off great and was actually a 4 or 4.5 star movie until the Riders in the Sky scene.  It was so unrealistic!  And the Blues Brothers is supposed to be a fairly realistic film.  When James Brown made a returning cameo in the Church scene, it went downhill with reality.  Near the end of the film when they go to the voodo house, it turned into a stupid fake looking film.  The first film was quite realistic, while this film was so fake it wasn't even funny!  In my opinion, this film ruined the franchise.  They should have left it at the original which is amazing!  If you are a diehard Blues fan then get this.  If you are an occasional fan, skip this and get the original.  I was quite disappointed with this film.",1395273600,,877,4.339506172839506

There are some dark components not meant for children to see, but it's still a great comedy altogether.  Sadly, some cast members are missing:  most importantly, the late John Belushi, who unfortunately passed away in 1981 after his final movie ""Continental Divide.""  Also sorely missing is Princess Leia -- a.k.a. Carrie Fisher the Flamethrower woman.  She was great in the first movie!!  And where is Ray Charles the ULTIMATE piano man?!

But other cameo appearances do make up for this.  First off is one time singer Nia Peeples.  She does a tremendous job as the police chief's lieutenant.  Cab Calloway (??) does well as the chief himself; it's interesting how he completely transforms into a God-loving-save-his-soul peacemaker much later in the movie, thanks to the late King of R & B/Soul singer James Brown, who ""invoked"" his wrath on the poor dude.

Now, being specific about the parts that I didn't like:  the first being the Russians invading Willie's Stripster Club, shooting up the joint and then setting it on fire.  The other part was Elwood looking like a ""mad dog"" (with shaving cream all over his face).  Finally, the Russians just HAD to show up to a cemetery to completely humiliate poor Tom Malone (which Jake and Elwood had previously done at his 5 star restaurant) the trumpet player -- then they shot at the desecrated headstones.

However, here is what WAS good about the movie: one is Roseanne's former counterpart, John Goodman.  He's not only a consummate actor, but he can sing too!  :)  Although he is a good ""replacement"" for Mr. Belushi, it's just not the same.  Aretha ""don't you EVER mess with her"" Franklin is back too, and looking a bit less slim (although, recently, she did become slim again).  She and Matt ""Guitar"" Murphy eventually got hitched and started running a Mercedes-Benz dealership.  But as usual, she knows that Matt wants to get back together with Elwood and his band, so she lets him leave, but NOT before doing her 1965 ultra mega smash number, ""Respect."" (And you BETTER give her some r-e-s-p-e-c-t, people!!)

Kathleen Freeman the nun also has a cameo, and she's STILL as mean as ever!!  And yes, she still has her ""weapon of choice"" which is more than just some wooden ruler (which she smacked upside Elwood/Jake's heads with!!).  She becomes angry when she realizes that Buster the kid is missing and is actually with Elwood.

Erykah Badu also steals the show as Queen Mousette.  It's not surprising that she has, well, Halloween-ish, nightmare-ish, ghoulish type stuff on her property and inside her chambers.  And she KNOWS how to sing and scat!!  I love how she turned the Russians into, well, mice.  They deserved it too -- HA!!  :)  More great musicians appear in the movie:  Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, B.B. King, etc.  But come on, NO chicken wire?!  It's just not right!  Hey at least the dozens of police cars chasing Elwood do get wrecked and smashed again!!  I don't know how Nia Peeples survived all of that!!

Since this movie, Donald ""Duck"" Dunn recently passed away.  I don't know about the other cast members, so of course I will have to Google them.  As for Dan Aykroyd, he has truly made a name for himself in all of the movies that he's done:  Ghostbusters, etc.  I would recommend this movie to the fans who already loved the first Blues Brothers movie, so please don't miss out!!",1390867200,,3515,4.713815789473684

But the addition of the child Blues Brother took the movie down to the level of Home Alone. And, unfortunately, there was the unavoidable lack of one of the original Blues Brothers in this movie. And there were some scenes that got a bit too strange, such as the horsemen ghost imagery during the bluegrass performance scene. Some scenes required a bit too much suspension of disbelief, such as the scene in which the police cars spent several minutes crashing, and Dan Akroyd controlling the Bluesmobile with a remote control. Maybe it would have been better if it had been released in the 80's, or if it didn't have to be compared to the original.",1382227200,,756,4.5661764705882355

1391849,5,B000053W55,"So, with the HORRIBLE reviews that this film received when it first came out and all of the people saying just how bad this film was, I just didn't rush to see it. As time went by, I simply forgot about it, but today my DVD-by-mail rental queue (you all know the one) finally got down to this movie as it was pretty far down the list. Yes, this movie was a thinly veiled re-hash of the original plot with the cops chasing them all over the place and the Russian mafia replacing the Nazis, but as many have said, it's just not about the plot.
This movie begins with the message, ""For John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy"" which honestly made me a little sad. As the movie went on and seeing all of the tremendous talent that has left this world for a better place (Alan ""Mr. Fabulous"" Rubin, Donald ""Duck"" Dunn, Koko Taylor, James Brown, Isaac Hayes, Wilson Pickett, Junior Wells, Bo Diddley, Lou Rawls, Billy Preston, Clarence Clemons, Grover Washington, JR., and even ""The Penguin"", actress Kathleen Freeman) I could not believe that it took me this long to see this movie.
It's true, the plot is goofy and basically just a poor excuse to put on a who's who of the Blues scene past and (at that time) present.
If you are a fan of the Blues, you need to see this film, not only to see the dearly departed listed above, but to get a glimpse of the artists that might just not have a lot of time left on this Earth (especially B.B. King, Aretha Franklin, Sam Moore, and Matt ""Guitar"" Murphy who I had heard already passed on at one time already).
Ignore the silly gags and overly excessive cop car crash scene and just enjoy seeing some master bluesmen (and women) practicing their craft! The battle of the bands sequence is simply awesome by the sheer volume of the amazing performers alone. A true blues fan will never be sorry seeing this film!",1376006400,,1851,4.399416909620991

It's not as funny as the original because of John Belushi not being in it, but I think John would have been proud of the music. I thought the music was the backbone of this production and that the artists did very well.

Seeing Eric Clapton, BB King, Bo Diddley, Clarence Clemons, and a whole host of other ""beyond famous"" artists all on stage at one time WAS very cool.

I know Blues Brothers 1998 just sounds stupid but they could've always had gone with Blues Brothers 2). There really is no semblance of plot, though there is an objective and that's to get to Queen Moussette's Battle of the Bands. What plot there is, well, its pretty much the first film all over again. What song opened the first film? A song by Taj Mahal. What opens this film? A song sung by Taj Mahal. Does Aretha Franklin sing to get her husband to stay in the first? Yes. Does she sing again in this to get him to stay? Yes. Do cast members sing snippets of the end credits song in both? Yes (more so in this than the last). I'll stop the list there as I'd hope you get the point. One thing they harp (3 characters give their condolences) on in the beginning is the absence of John Belushi, and knowing that trying to get a new actor to play Jake would be like spitting in the face of the Brothers' fans, the character is also conveniently ""gone"", as no one in this movie actually says the word dead. Even when The Penguin tells Elwood about Curtis, she doesn't say dead. It sounds like I'm rambling about this but it just bugs me. Just say the guy's dead! John Goodman is a decent replacement for Belushi and can sing well but its a shame that once Cab is in the picture he's pushed to the sidelines in terms of singing (but he pretty much does that to Elwood when he's introduced). Joe Morton is also pretty good but I think his inclusion into the band only happened because the director wanted to recreate the church scene again. And then there's J. Evan Bonifant as Buster. I just don't like him, he adds nothing to the story and with that, makes four leads in the band which, I think is too much. There are too many WTF moments in this compared to the previous one like Elwood being able to hide in the car. Literally. The car going underwater (that's a little more extreme than all the fantastical stunts from the first) and all the magic elements in the last thirty minutes of the film. They don't belong in there. And whereas the first film had great car chases, the one's featured here are not as memorable. I think the only thing they accomplished was beating the record they set from the first. The music on the other hand is the only standout in this. So many great singers and musicians together in one film that you'll probably never see that happen ever again in cinema.

The movie sports a ""Who's Who"" of modern-day blues musicians and singers and also is directed by John Landis, who has directed some of the most entertaining films of the last 25 years.

Yes, it's a dumb story......very dumb......but it's about the music.

The leading actors were amusing: Dan Akyroyd and John Goodman - and a really neat-looking little kid in J. Evan Bonifant who really makes me laugh. Just looking at this 10-year-old dancing is his Blues Brothers outfit alone is worth a number of laughs. Some of the characters in here are so outrageous they would be tough to describe. The car chases, the dances and clothing were all over-the-top story.  No, this isn't Shakespeare and it wasn't meant to be. It's probably closer to Dukes Of Hazzard.  It's a much nicer-edged movie than the first Blues Brothers but  too many people want ""edgy"" material all the time.

Not only are the characters colorful, so is the cinematography, making it both a visual and audio treat. So....just look at it as a blue concert with a few laughs, and, hopefully, you'll enjoy it.",1233273600,,1271,4.552631578947368
1391955,3,B000053W55,"Elwood Blues (Dan Ackroyd) is released from prison only to find that his brother Jake (John Belushi) has died in his absence. And that's not the only thing that's changed. The orphanage where he grew up is closing, and Sister Mary Stigmata asks for his help in raising money for the children's hospital that will be taking its place.

The answer to which is, of course, putting the band back together. Oh, and in the meantime, the good sister wants Elwood to spend a couple of hours with Buster, one of the last kids from the orphanage.

There are the usual hijinks with putting the band back together, and Elwood forgets about taking Buster back. So the cops, including Cab, the illegitimate son of Curtis (Cab Calloway, who also died in the meantime), who's sort of an honorary stepbrother, are after him for kidnapping the boy. And of course there are a bunch of other groups after him, including some of those from the first movie who are after revenge.

Once again, it's a race to get to The One Gig that'll earn them the money they need. This time, it's a battle of the bands in New Orleans.

The problem is, my summary sounds a lot more cohesive than the plot is. Starting with the obvious question of why Elwood was the only one in jail (at the end of the last movie, they were all in jail. Granted, the other band members might have had lesser sentences, but Jake's should have been the same as Elwood's).

The Mission From God wasn't really a mission from God, this time. The orphanage is closing regardless, and Elwood's quest is more along the lines of a charity drive, so there's no urgency there.

Buster and Cab... well, I didn't much see the point. They seemed like tangents to me. Cab's story could have been pretty good--learning about and then eventually embracing his musical heritage--but it's barely touched on.

And then once they get to New Orleans, there's some completely out-of-left-field magical voodoo effect that make no sense and doesn't have anything to do with the plot. It's almost like a few minutes of footage from another film got spliced into this one by mistake, except that the same actors are in it.

On the other hand, there's the music. It's no surprise that the DVD has 3 stars, while the soundtrack has 4.5. The sheer number--and quality!--of famous musicians who appear in this movie is amazing. In the jam sessions at the end, we made a game of trying to see who could identify more of them.

Mostly, the plot is rushed through to get to the music. Which is, I suppose, understandable, unless you compare it with the original, in which the plot, while simplistic, still made sense, and was funny as hell. It feels like they tried to add too much to make up for the absence of Belushi and Calloway, when a simpler plot would have worked better--it could have been more completely explored, and it wouldn't have been so obvious that the plot was sacrificed to the music.

It was great music, though. So much so that my kids argued with me about giving this 3 stars, saying it deserved more just for the music.",1227052800,,3054,4.556569343065694

1391957,3,B000053W55,"Making a sequel of the 1980 megablockbuster ""Blues Brothers"" after the 1983 death of John Belushi is, at its gentlest, a very bad idea, and at its starchiest, a universe-altering affront bordering on celestial heresy.

The uneven and overall creepy sequel named ""Blues Brothers 2000"" (which came out in 1998) is--simultaneously--very good and very awful.  The ghost of John Belushi floats above the whole affair, and that ain't good.  Oddly, the music in the sequel is really, really good, and much bluesier than in the original film.

""Blues Brothers 2000"" seems like an awkward, almost surreal mixture of big budget, big names, pencil-thin script ideas, and fear of the ghost of John Belushi.  This movie tries--and fails--to be many things at once: a movie for true blues fans; a movie for kids; a light-hearted comedy; a gritty, insider-winking-at-clever-jokes-about-the-blues-community chuckle parade; and a worthy sequel to its predecessor.

You will not be wrong in calling this film a train wreck.  Dan Ackroyd's attempt at a Chicago accent (.......he sounds--alas--Canadian) is not up to snuff for me, a pure Cook County product.  Also, when watching this dumbed-down-below-dumb script, I continuously found it hard to believe that sober adults would have knowingly agreed to be part of this project.

You know what?  Last night in the Wal-Mart parking lot I saw one of those cool grasshoppers that look like they're actually a little green stick.  Very cool!  Anyway, that grasshopper who looks like a stick and lives outside of Wal-Mart...even he--an INSECT--would have thought that the script of ""Blues Brothers 2000"" was stupid as all getout.

So...the movie gets three stars nonetheless because the MUSIC in it is absolutely first-rate, as long as you ignore everything that actors Dan Ackroyd and John Goodman sing on the soundtrack alongside a Mount Olympus of blues gods.

Everywhere else had disco, commercial retro cover/note-for-note copy rock, Rap, or ""dueling pianos"".  & of course, there was NO live Jazz anywhere. B-O-R-I-N-G. Went to BB King's Club/restaurant:  The band was playing a note-for-note cover version of ""Celebration"" by Kool and The Gang!  It was like a Wedding band!  Of course we immediately left. Shame on you, BB, and shame on you, Memphis. Doesn't Anyone care about Authentic music anymore?!  Memphis advertises it's city as the ""Home of The Blues""!  Pathetic. & while I'm on the subject, where's The Blues music at ""The House of Blues"" chain/restaurants/bars, which were originally started by Danny Akroyd??

1391960,4,B000053W55,"So what does happen after the Blues Brothers did their time dancing to the
""Jailhouse Rock?"" From the start this sequel starts off on a very mournful note as Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) finally gets out of prison after 18 years doing time. The world is now a very different place; brother Jake is gone, Curtis, their mentor has also passed on and the only place they called home, the beloved orphanage, has closed down. A ""concerned"" Mother Mary (Kathleen Freeman) with stick in hand gives Elwood the opportunity to mentor a young orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant). Elwood also learns that he does have kind of a family: Curtis' illegitimate son, Cab, (Joe Morton) works nearby...but, of all things, he's a police officer. After Elwood ""borrows"" some money from him, he picks up the new ""Bluesmobile"" with Buster in tow and is off to once again reunite the Blues Brothers Band. Along the way there comes a new partner, Mighty Mack(John Goodman) but there also follow some angry Russians and an entire police force hot on their trail. This time, the ultimate destination is a battle-of-the-bands tournament hosted by the mysterious Queen Mousette (Erykah Badu) in a Louisiana swamp as they go up against some rather stiff competition which includes the likes of B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Bo Diddley, Lou Rawls, Koko Taylor, Dr. John among others.

Granted, the storyline is considerably weaker in contrast to the first movie, and after some time, you feel like you're watching one big music video rather than a movie. What makes this one checking out is that first of all, the number of awesome blues/soul musicians present and how they play charcters integral to the story such as B.B. King, Aretha Franklin and James Brown (who both reprise their roles), Sam Moore (of Sam & Dave), Wilson Pickett, Eddie Floyd and of course the Blues Brothers band. All of whom are non-actors yet they do more convincing jobs at acting than some of these hack actors and actresses out there now; they don't have to try too hard yet they're still fun to watch, which is what this film is supposed to convey, I suppose.

Though it started sad, the tone gradually picks up and you can't help but be absorbed by the music. With the absence of John Belushi, who brought such unbelieveable vitality to the act, of course it is not the same, just
like the saying ""they sure don't make 'em like that anymore,"" this is proof of that: the entertainment industry saw some big downfalls especially in cinema and this one was hit pretty hard.

The other weakness of this movie is how cartoonish some of the aspects of it are, such as the 1 1/2 minute police car crash (it looks funny yet just plain silly at the same time), the Bluesmobile going underwater, etc.
Much of the musical numbers are modeled after those in the first movie: Aretha now sings ""Respect"", James Brown, this time with Sam Moore, with a full choir lead a tent revival congregation in another uplifting, fast gospel number, and the BB band once again briefly perform in the guise of a country/western outfit. The inclusions of them are fine, but the content is what the producers and choreographers seemed to get carried away with and borderline the point of absolute oddity. To my knowledge, the Razzie award people did not even nominate this film for anything, so
you know it can't be that bad.

If you are a true Blues Brothers fan, there's still much to enjoy and you'll at least appreciate it if not like it a lot.",1198108800,,3458,4.682565789473684

1391964,3,B000053W55,"""Blues Brothers 2000"" is a disappointing sequel, and yet for some reason I preferred it to the other disappointing sequel from the World of Aykroyd:  ""Ghostbusters II"". Maybe it's because the greater amount of time that passed between films makes BB2K feel more nostalgic. Or maybe it's because, to the extent that BB2K is a retread of the original ""Blues Brothers"", the repetition feels more natural and logical than in GB2.

When Elwood is released from prison and discovers that Jake has passed on, what exactly do viewers expect him to do other than attempt to reunite the band? What else would he do to rediscover meaning and purpose in his life? Therefore it makes perfect sense that the first two-thirds of BB2K echoes plot elements from the previous film. Where BB2K falls down is in the third act -- the Battle of the Bands at Queen Mousette's -- which is a spectacular musical climax but leaves much to be desired in comedy-action terms.

I was surprised by how moved I was to see the character of Elwood in another movie, in particular when he plays his harmonica for the first time. But the most remarkable scene in BB2K is probably ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"", which combines American popular music, a supernatural manifestation, and the Bluesmobile doing something amazing. It's the perfect cinematic summation of Dan Aykroyd's interests and career.

Blu-Ray addendum, 11/4/2013: The Blu-Ray edition of BB2K has the poorest picture quality (although it's far from awful) of any of the Blu-Rays I've seen since purchasing an HDTV and Blu-Ray player a few months ago. Presumably the DVD edition played on an HDTV would have even lower picture quality, but the BB2K Blu-Ray simply does not have the clarity we expect from the Blu-Ray format. Look at the scene of Elwood sitting discouraged with his hat off in the clearing and Buster walking over to him: every leaf and blade of grass should be sharp and clear, but they're not.

Also, I always thought that DVDs (including BB2K) on which the movie started as soon as you put it into the player, and the main menu didn't appear unless requested with the remote, were of lesser quality than those on which the menu appeared first. The former kind of DVD seemed to be designed for users who didn't understand how DVDs worked. I had assumed this practice would disappear with the advent of the Blu-Ray format, but on the BB2K Blu-ray the film starts immediately after the opening logos and warnings, and there is no top menu -- only the pop-up menu that appears over the film itself. (The menu is in the same format as on other Universal Blu-Rays, with the main selections in a vertical curved area on the left side of the screen and the chapter menu appearing horizontally across the bottom of the screen.) Apparently Universal classes BB2K in a lower tier of less important movies that don't deserve proper treatment on either DVD or Blu-Ray.",1184112000,,2900,4.768924302788845

It's painful to write this since the lead actors--Ackroyd, John Goodman, and Joe Morton--are so likeable.  But it missteps all the way.  I thought the cliche of the cute kid (J. Evan Bonifant) sidekick went away decades ago.  Many scenes in this film, such as Elwood's meeting with Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman) and the catclysmic finale to a police chase, are direct remakes of scenes from the first film, but here they feel tired and mechanical.  The fantasy sequences of the first film (Jake seeing the light; the Nazi car dropping from an impossible height) managed to be fun, but the ones in this film are outlandish and silly.  The one saving grace, and the reason I give two stars instead of one, is that there are some great musical numbers.

In fact, he is one of the FEW people left in Hollywood that I have respect for. However, this movie, frankly, is an insult and an abomination to the originality and ingenuity of the first film, and frankly, to the memory and legacy of the late, great John Belushi.

Some films are suited for sequels, and others are not. As one reviewer stated, if it had been done not too long after the original and while Belushi were still alive, then it would have been an excellent follow-up to the first. This is a disaster!

The chemistry Akroyd and Belushi had in the first Blues Brothers is legendary, irreplaceable and unmatched even to this day, and is lacking totally in this movie. John Goodman? Good actor in other films, but not this one. It would have been better not to make this film at all. I began to watch it just out of curiosity, and eventually felt an emptiness knowing Belushi will not be in it. I ripped it out of the VCR partially into the movie and vowed never to see it again.

In 1997,ABC pulled the plug on Goodman's Emmy-winning sitcom Roseanne after a nine-season run. A short time later,he and Aykroyd made this sequel to the 1980 hit movie.

Aretha Franklin can never sing as well as she did in the original movie, but she was very good in this movie too. There is also an appearence by Blues Traveler, whom I had never heared of before I saw this movie, but found that he was pretty good. in my opinion, they waited too long to make this sequel, but better late than never.

The result is far short of perfect, and as a result the creaters have suffered a howling chorus of dreadful reviews. But step back and realize that anything short of the PERFECT sequel would have been critically thrashed, to say nothing of what the fans would have done (and did). Now one can see so many of the things that went right that could have gone horrifically wrong. In bringing John Goodman aboard, They refused to try to replace Jake, and instead created the new, likeable Mighty Mack, a much lower-key personality, and left Elwood in the driver's seat.  I do want to say a second and point that Goodman is legitimately GOOD in this movie, without any handicapping. The same loony stunts are back. Then, ultimately, they DID remember the single best thing about the original movie, the music (as they adroitly pointed out in the first trailer). Here they have lined up a staggering array of musical talent, and the movie gets lively, upbeat feel from the marvelous sound.
Of course, they also did a lot wrong. J. Evan Bonifant, as Buster Blues, is a mysterious addition. Cab Blues is an even more bizarre addition, purely added, in my estimation, to cover another loss (Cab Calloway) and let them re-work the I-see-the-light-scene from the first. The movie hems a little TOO close to the original, and quite frankly, the first movie's plot was stretched almost transparently thin in the first telling, setting aside the second. Some of the cameos are bordering on offensively flat (Darrell Hammond's, in particular), and that really brings us to the sum of the movie: it has all the right parts, but somehow they don't fit together. But many of the parts are REALLY right.
But there a lot of friendly nods to the first film, and the movie keeps a fun breezy spirit. And really, on its own, without trying to make it stand next to the towering, built-up remembrance of the first, it is a fun movie with terrific music.
The DVD, though, is one documentary away from being a direct copy of the VHS release. Shame! Shame! At least the DVD lets you skip to the musical numbers.
Overall, it's a movie I liked an enjoyed, and like to go back to and watch every now and then (more than the original, mainly because its easier to skip scenes without a feeling of missing out). Not a great movie, but still something fun.",1081641600,,2495,4.5941704035874436

He is informed that his brother has died, but accepts this knowing that he is in a better place, probably performing the blues for the angels. From here, the plot doesn't matter, and much of it doesn't make sense. This is fine by me, since I didn't see either films for their plots. The music is what makes the Blues Brothers and the music is what makes this movie. While it occasionally loses some of the spirit of the first film, and the absence of Belushi has a silent impact on the audience, one cannot deny that this movie holds up impressively well.

Joe Morton, on the other hand, did a pretty good job. I never knew that guy could sing after seeing him in movies like T2 and Speed.
If you're looking for plot or interesting dialog, you'll be disappointed with this movie. As far as the music goes, it has a lot more than the first movie. I think most of the music is better than the first movie.
This movie has almost all the actors from the first movie. Even the old guy who blows the whistle at the prison during the opening scenes of both movies.

And I enjoyed almost all of the original BLUES BROTHERS. However, I'm sad to say that this long delayed and awaited sequel is a poor companion to the original; Akyroyd and Landis have prostituted their talents for almost nothing. It has nothing to do with the absence of the late John Belushi either (John Goodman does a decent job as a replacement). It has everything to do with the poorly written script. The original film had a few outrageous scenes (the chase at the end is far-fetched, but remains as the best chase scene of all time), but they were tightly knitted together. Not so in BLUES BROTHERS 2000. It is as though Aykroyd and Landis just rehashed stuff from the first movie to make this film seem Blues Brothersish. It just doesn't work. Outside of Goodman and Aykroyd, the only thing that saves this film from being a total flop is the music. Therefore, you're better off listening to the soundtrack than watching the movie.

I think we all agree that the all-star Blues jam with BB King, Clapton, Bo Diddley, Lou Rawls, Charlis Musslewhite, Jr. Wells, Paul Shaffer, Gary US Bonds, etc. was the best thing about this film. A treat for us hardcore R&B conisseurs. The gospel revival scene with the Godfather (that's James Brown to some of you) was almost as good as BB#1, but this one has a tinge of sacrilege to those who take this kind of religion devoutly. The stuff about the kid was okay, but why the hell would they film a scene with a little boy in a strip joint surrounded by half-naked strippers?
Yeah, it's full of flaws and lacks the fun and charm of BB#1. Goodman is a fine comic, but repalcing him for Belushi is like having Lou Costello replace Oliver Hardy. It ain't happening y'all. Just enjoy the music and have a good time.

1392017,2,B000053W55,"The original ""Blues Brothers"" film was an epic comedy.  There is something very special about it, as many other reviewers here have expressed.  For me, ""The Blues Brothers"" is to comedy what ""Star Wars"" is to sci-fi/adventure.  No other film is quite like it, and the key characters have become pop culture icons.
I think that the reason for making this film was to try and revive the long-time declining careers of Dan Aykroyd and John Landis.  It is very unfortunate they didn't reconsider.  ""Blues Brothers 2000"" tries to maintain a happy-go-lucky feel, but three very important people are missing.
As has been said over and over again, John Belushi was fifty percent of the Blues Brothers and therefore ends up sorely missed.  Probably the best scene in the movie is the opening, with the stark rendition of ""John the Revelator"" playing while Elwood is released from prison.  Elwood waits at the side of the road, unaware that his brother has passed away.  It is a shockingly melancholy and very moving way to begin the film.  Even more shocking is how hard Aykroyd and Landis strain to make the viewers forget this sadness throughout the remainder of the film.
Other key participants missing from this film are the late John Candy and Cab Calloway.  Candy provided a lot of laughs in the first film and Calloway provided a lot of heart (he was, after all, a father figure to Jake and Elwood).
I have seen some reviews say it is unfair to compare this film with the original.  Well, I don't see how one can NOT compare it-- so much of ""Blues Brothers 2000"" merely rehashes classic scenes from the first film-- to much poorer effect.  Aretha does ""Respect"" in place of ""Think"", the band again incites the anger of a racist organization, a significant 'revelation' occurs at a gospel church, etc, etc.  If ""2000"" had attempted to be it's own film without relying so heavily on the earlier one, maybe it would've had a chance to stand on its own.
In place of Belushi we have THREE new frontmen-- John Goodman, Joe Morton, and the young kid (I don't remember the actor's name).  All give it their all (and Joe Morton is actually a pretty good singer), but it's really a lost cause.",979430400,,2181,4.645833333333333

Elwood then loses something because he now has to take the front role, thus losing his monotone quality that was so much a part of his character in the first film. This battle of the bands, however, is a real plus. Seeing B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Charlie Musselwhite etc. on stage together was thrilling.",978912000,,500,4.566666666666666

Back again are the stupid thugs ya love to hate -- the same old morons from the KKK and neo-Nazi militia, and a creepy new bunch, the Russkiy Mafiya.  In a rehash of the original, the entire Illinois police department is again in hot pursuit of our heroes.  This time around they're all enroute to the Louisiana Bayou for a Creole voodoo-Queen's annual ""Battle of the Blues"".  It's great to watch the Blues Brothers revisit some of the clubs and folks they scammed in the original.  Of course, the best thing about the 2000 version is the reunion of all the wonderful musicians  (Well, most, that is; the years, unfortunately, have taken their toll, and only the music is immortal...)

That is, a light comedy with some good blues music, and some high energy performances by Akroyd, Goodman, et al.  Sure, Goodman's not Belushi, but so what?  He was funny and that's what it's all about, isn't it.
I noticed that in the first 10 reviews I read, three of the reviewers identified themselves as ""huge Blues Brothers fans.""  I think that I'd like to be a huge fan too.  How does one qualify?  Is there a membership fee and a card that identifies a huge fan?  Or, maybe I have to put on weight, or perhaps, you're just born a huge fan.  I like the Blues Brothers, I've even seen a Blues Brothers look-alike group perform at Universal Studios.  I stayed and watched the whole performance.  Will that qualify me?
Anyway, to reiterate my opening comments,I did enjoy this movie, and I feel no need to compare it to the original which I liked too -- on just the same basis -- a couple of hours of escapist entertainment -- that ought to be enough for this type of movie.

I think it is inevitable that when an actor, athlete, singer, or what have you, takes over a role or position that someone else has made famous, a number of unfavorable comparisons are made.  (Look at what happened when Steve Young first appeared as quarterback in San Francisco.  Many fans were very vocal about expressing opinions that he would never fill Joe Montana's shoes.  Time sure proved them wrong.)
The late John Belushi brought his unique form of expression to the original BLUES BROTHERS movie.  John Goodman brings a different kind of talent.  Why not give him credit for what he does rather than make comparisons.  I thought that his evolution from a wimpy bartender to Akroyd's stage partner actually took a bit of acting talent.
Additionally, there was a lot of high energy musical talent on display, and a lot of humor if you were willing to accept this movie as what it was:  a comedy featuring the comedic talents of Akroyd, Goodman, and their supporting cast, in addition to their own brand of singing and dancing styles.

Just released  from prison (in which brother Jake died), Elwood Blues goes about  reassembling a band.  If he was capable of doing this without Jake, then  why didn't he do it in ""The Blues Brothers""?  Easy answer:  he  couldn't.  Elwood's lineup includes an annoying kid (J. Evan Bonifant), a  marginally adequate vocalist (John Goodman, in the worst role he's ever  played), and eventually, Elwood's long lost brother (played by an obviously  embarrassed Joe Morton)who has become a Captain in the Illinois State  Police.
The only redeeming part of this motion picture is an all star  ""battle of the bands"" blues jam featuring big names such as Eric  Clapton, Blues Traveler, B. B. King, and Johnny Lang (among others) that  will blow your socks off.  Sadly, even that cannot save this awful motion  picture.  In reality, ""Blues Brothers 2000"" is nothing more than  a good blues jam preceded by an insipid and uninspired action movie that is  uninteresting and unentertaining.

Dan Ackroyd') Thank GOD they used John  Goodman instead of Belushi's brother. I didn't like the scene where they  all turned into zombies, that was embarrassing--and what the heck did it  have to do with the plot? Speaking of the plot, it was pretty much  non-existent, mainly an excuse to rehash scenes from the original. But as  for the good stuff...Ackroyd did as good of a job as he could.  He  obviously took off weight for the role, though he is far from the slim,  fast-dancing, sexy Elwood he used to be. His dancing has slowed down, but  is still solid. He's actually still pretty charming in parts. The kid  didn't annoy me anywhere as near as much as I thought he would (mostly  because he didn't have many lines) and could really dance, though I winced  when he sang. The scene I replayed over and over, that I will probably buy  the movie just to own, was when they did ""Ghost Riders in the  Sky"" and there are these killer visuals of storm clouds and then the  actual ghost riders themselves--I practically levitated, that part looked  so damn cool.  Of course, the best thing by far was the sound-track.  ""John the Revelator"" gave me goose bumps. ""Lovelight""  and even the corny ""Lookin for a Fox"" caused me to go out and buy  the sound-track almost immediately, though I couldn't meet the clerk's eye  when I bought it, I was so embarrassed.

1392030,2,B000053W55,"Even if this had been an excellent film, which it is not, there would have been something inherently sad about it.  That Belushi's frenzied, comical zeal is missing goes without saying, but seeing Elwood without his brother  just seems wrong.  It is impossible to view this film without feeling  impacted by the real-life tragedy of Belushi's death.  In fact, one of the  best scenes in ""BB2000"" is a dialogue-free, wide-view shot of the  warden telling Elwood that Jake has died, and Elwood's physical reaction to  the news.
Goodman is game, but his timid character leaves Aykroyd as the  leader of the band and the film, which seems totally antithetical to  Elwood's original, understated demeanor.  Jim Belushi, with the same sense  of danger as his brother (both consistently seem about a second away from  total meltdown), would have made a lot more sense.  The apparent desire for  a PG-13 rating really seems to damper the ""anything goes"" spirit  of the whole Blues Brothers act, further weakening an already desperate  venture.
As a huge fan of the Blues Brothers, I am glad to be able to say  that there are some stunning moments on the soundtrack.  At least that  component of the Blues Brothers has been kept alive -- exposing mainstream  culture to some great music, predominantly ignored by the masses.  The  Blues Brothers may not have been the best blues singers around, but they  surrounded themselves with talent that might not gotten the attention it  deserved without them.  This is about the only thing the two films have in  common (except for a shamelessly unimaginative re-hash of the original's  plot).

1392037,5,B000053W55,"The plot to this movie is basicly the same as the first, the acting is fair, but the music is fantastic. Most of the performers if not all are world class, the who's who in clasic rock, soul, blues are in this movie!",946598400,,216,4.046511627906977
1392038,2,B000053W55,"Most of this movie is virtually unwatchable. Of the 41 chapters on the DVD, there are 5, and that includes the closing credits, that'd I'd want to see again, all excellent musical numbers. A movie can't be all bad that has  Eric Clapton and B.B. King on guitar.
On the other hand, a movie can't  be called good that has a plot that defines contrived, 4 real actors in a  cast of dozens, indifferent cinematography, lazy direction, and John  Goodman in the place of John Belushi.  It is an insult to the memory of the  hallowed original that this movie was released.",926208000,,565,4.490196078431373
1392039,4,B000053W55,"The plot, acting, etc are not nearly as good as the first, but the music, especially the last two Jams are spectacular. Putting this many great musicians in one place usually falls apart to egos, but not here.  Must buy  sound trackl",925430400,,233,4.523809523809524

1392041,4,B000053W55,"Many people are panning this film.  I admit it is nowhere near the legendary status of the first film, nothing ever could be.  But it's funny, has great music and is generally a good 90 odd minutes of fun.  What's  wrong with that?",918000000,,231,4.3023255813953485
1392042,5,B000053W55,"This movie was a great sequel to the original Blues Brothers. It was of course, too difficult to replace John Belushi, so it was good to go another way, which was to just let the music EXPLODE and take over. All the cast  did a great job- Enjoy it! PLAY IT LOUD ! I'm sorry I missed it in the  theatre...
P.S. The new Oldsmobiles are in early this year.",913507200,,353,4.0285714285714285
1392043,4,B000053W55,"I am a very big fan of Blues and rock music.  This movie is definetly a continuation of the story of the Blues Brothers, and has a lot of similar actions to the original (car wreck, cops, extreme actions) but is  different.  John Goodman makes an excellent addition and I am glad they did  not try to replace Belushi or Calloway with other actors as that would pull  away from who they were.  Well worth adding to any collection especially if  you like the blues and liked the first movie.",911260800,,489,4.366666666666666

They are all crazy about both movies, but I'm into the blues and both movies highlight some of the old greats in blues and in Jazz (like Cab Calloway). So I watch it regularly.

7930307,5,B000053W55,"""Blues Brothers 2000"" is definitely better than the original ""Blues Brothers"" movie although of course the plot line is thin but this wasn't going to be a masterpiece. This is a fun movie with all the original players with a few new ones thrown in but the best part of this movie is the music! This movie boasts the talents of not only the Blue Brothers Band but also the likes of B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Taj Mahal, Isaac Hayes, Dr. John, Lou Rawls, Steve Winwood, Sam Moore, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, James Brown and a whole lot more! Also we find out the Joe Morton, who plays the son of Curtis, Elwood & Jake's mentor, John Goodman, who plays Mighty Mac and J. Evan Bonifant, who plays Buster Blues can all sing well enough to hold their own with this cast of seasoned professionals. Dan Aykroyd has put together a sensational cast as a sequel to the first movie. It's a fun movie with great music!",1521244800,,909,4.449101796407185
