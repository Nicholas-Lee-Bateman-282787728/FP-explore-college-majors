909584,4,6304564414,"Let's go easy and be fair: ""Caged Heat"" deserved its rank as the best of the women-in-prison series that marked the glory days of drive-in movies. Although Jonathan Demme's directorial debut was not a real success, it gave us a chance to enjoy the glamour of so many beautiful girls while showing their skin off and on did try their best to act as well: Erica Gavin (the famous vixen in ""Vixen!""), Roberta Collins (Pam Grier's co-star in such previous WIP flicks as ""Women In Cages"", ""The Big Bird Cage"", ""The Big Doll House""), Rainbeaux Smith (aka Cheryl Smith in ""Slumber Party '57""), Juanita Brown (Pam Grier's co-star in ""Foxy Brown"") etc... What else can we ask for??? I'm glad to watch ""Caged Heat"" again, now on DVD so I can go to any ""hot"" chapter any time. Too bad ""Vixen!"" hasn't been released on DVD yet, but if you like this one I would recommend all the above mentioned WIP hits of the '70s. They aren't as good as ""Caged Heat"" but still worth checking out for their own flavors.",1042675200,15,992,4.486187845303867
909585,5,6304564414,"This film is a classic.  There are a lot of women in prison films out there, but this one takes the cake.  Most films of this type do not contain any real substance aside from violence and nudity.  However, not only does  this movie have violence and nudity (lots of nudity)but it has real  meaning.  The story is about the power of friendship.  All of the women in  prison have done horrible things to get there, but now that they're in a  situation where they are faced with extreme punishment they have to stick  together in order to survive.  It's a masterpiece!  Own it....and if you  really like it be sure to check out THE BIG BIRD CAGE.",944092800,24,644,4.3559322033898304

909811,2,6304564414,"Caged Heat has all the typical elements of a 70s women-in-prison film; a cruelly sadistic warden and prison guards, wrongfully imprisoned inmates, lust-crazed, predatory lesbians, inmate rivalries, etc. This particular film genre, was as ubiquitous during the 70s, as the Afro hairdo.

It's a Roger Corman pic, starring Roberta Collins, and a few other actors who appeared in many of his other AIP films. It has the low-budget veneer of Corman's other films, along with the nudity, gratuitous sex, over-the-top violence, and subversive story-lines that are Corman's signature as a producer.

This movie isn't the worst of the low-budget women-in-prison films, but I've seen better. For those that like this movie genre, Caged Heat offers adequate, if mediocre entertainment.",1261872000,3,774,5.495798319327731
909812,2,6304564414,"First off, I LOVE a good WIP flick, this just happens NOT to be one of them. The other reviewers are demented in their attempts to add meaning to this worthless celluloid waste of time. It`s the same old plot Corman used in at least 2 or 3 of his other WIP flix, the women are ugly, the dialogue unbearable, the acting third rate, and it`s a vivid portrayal of everything that went wrong in 70`s cinema. This is grindhouse at its worst - grab yourself a Jess Franco flick instead, there`s a much better chance you won`t want to trade your eyes for a pair of running shoes when the women get undressed.",1260662400,3,601,4.280701754385965

The fact that I don't remember to much that was interesting is evidence that the plot was not very good and the acting left little to desire. I felt that this movie had the potential to be a four star attraction. I guest you can blame that on the writers. I have 100's of DVD's in my collection...and can detail all the good/great one's.

I was not particularly impressed with this movie. It did arrive on time though.",1176163200,2,473,4.314606741573034

Of course Caged Heat is loaded with the T&A that one would expect. Plenty of fine women in this one. Besides the eye candy, Caged Heat is very entertaining. There's the lady who got caught trying to escape from a robbery, and Belle the woman who likes to steal and crawls through the rafters to get food to her friend who is in solitary.

One afternoon while working outside, a couple of women come up with a plan to escape from the prison. Two getaway and meet up with a friend, then they decide to go back and bust they're friends out. Will the women be victorious. Watch Caged Heat and find out!",1132876800,6,751,4.251748251748252
909950,4,6304564414,"This 1974 R-rated girls-in-prison movie is director Jonathan Demme's debut as a director and he is also credited as the writer.  This is the same Demme that made many mainstream films, like 1991's Silence of the Lambs (for which he received the Best Director Oscar), and 1993's Philadelphia. The movie stars Erica Gavin (formerly an exotic dancer whose first film was the X-rated Vixen and whose last film she acted in was Caged Heat; she plays Jackie Wilson), Barbara Steele (Caged Heat marked the return of Steele after a five year absence; as Warden McQueen, though she is listed as Superintendent McQueen), Juanita Brown (as Maggie), Roberta Collins (as Belle), Ella Reid (as Pandora), Warren Miller (Doctor Randolph) and Rainbeaux Smith (as Lavelle).  This movie is in the ""Roger Corman Classics"" product line.  Corman's company distributed this film, though it did not finance it.

The DVD contains the movie, special features and preview attractions.  The special features are an interview with Roger Corman, an ""Original Trailer"" of Caged Heat, and a ""Cast and Crew"" information section (three cast, the director, and Roger Corman).  The ""Preview Attractions"" section contains trailers for ""Candy Stripe Nurses,"" ""Big Bad Mama II,"" ""The Big Doll House,"" and ""Crazy Mama.""

The movie is about a prison in Conorville where a new-inmate (Erica Gavin as Jackie Wilson) joins an unruly prison population managed by wheel-chair bound Warden (or Superintendent) McQueen (Barbara Steele).

The movie opens with the main star of the show, Jackie Wilson, being arrested, tried and sentenced to prison (term of 10-40 years).  Then the action moves to the prison just prior to Jackie's arrival.  We see an attractive blonde inmate dreaming of her man coming by the prison and fondling her.  Then its morning and we learn that strangely enough, the women in this prison do not wear prison uniforms, but whatever street clothes they want to wear (though they occasionally wear uniforms).  As the opening montage of prison life scrolls across the screen, one of the scenes outdoors has a blonde woman leaning against a fence, and written on a wall behind her is a sign in big bold block letters that says ""No Laughing.""  This certainly is a rather slow moving movie, at least at the beginning.

While these women in street clothes stand around prison, new arrivals arrive, including Jackie Wilson. The new arrivals are brought to an area that appears to be along a hallway where a doctor is sitting.  Three of the new female prisoners are brought before a male doctor, who tells them to strip, right there in the hallway. The women strip and the doctor pulls on some gloves, one of the female guards begins to look very happy, and the scene ends before any actual ""inspections.""

Jackie then joins the prison population.  The women stand around barely clothed (inside) playing games, reading, participating in plays, etc.  Sometimes they get to see the outside world when they are sent off to work on farms (where two try to break out of prison).  Not all is well in prison, as some of the harder inmates tend to pick on the others (including one scene where a woman searches for her cigarettes, goes into another cell and ribs the shirt off a blonde (a lot less of this type of activity than might expect).  The Warden is no better, and might even be a little insane.  If she doesn't like something an inmate is doing, she throws them naked into isolation cells (like when she didn't like one actor's performance in a play (or maybe that had something to do with the actress having a picture of her boyfriend with her)).

The woman are bored, somewhat terrorized by other inmates (including some inmate fights), occasionally have the Warden throw them naked into solitary confinement, and occasionally are attacked by the male doctor who shocks them, and sometimes likes using his drugs on the inmates (one shown), and then taking advantage of them.  They also tend to have some very strange dreams.  The normal prison shower scenes occur (interesting little scene where the women line up nude waiting for the shower, then the star is yelled at by another woman while in the shower, but no ""fun"" in the shower). There is also some corrective physical therapy that involves electric shock therapy and unnecessary surgery that I don't tend to see in these types of movies. There is also the normal attempted prison break (though these guards seem to be more competent than some I've seen), and there actually are more attempted prison breaks than I normally see (and the guards definitely remember what their guns are for).  Two of the women escape and the fact that the inmates were wearing street clothes in prison certainly helped their escape.  They wander around in the outside world, robbing a bank, etc. A lot of Jackie's trouble stems from her own stupid actions and her fellow inmates stupid actions (actually, there seems to be a lot of stupid people in this movie).

Overall, the movie is a strange little prison and prison escape film. The film's plot is full of holes, and a little odd.  The acting is varied, at times not that bad, sometimes wooden, sometimes good, and some of the women can't act. The setting is a prison, a rather gritty pealing dirty little female prison, and the outside world (including a farm, and a strange little place where men and women wrestle in private rooms in their underwear).  The prisoners tend to be attractive, though some are not.  While the guards tend to be unattractive, though some are attractive.  By comparison, this film is a better film than the Pam Grier ""Woman in Cages"" movie that is also in the Roger Corman Classics product line-up. As a mainstream film, this film has too much nudity and plot holes, as an ""adult"" film, this has too little ""action.""  (~4.12)",1114732800,23,5816,4.849342770475228
909951,3,6304564414,"CAGED HEAT begins with the character of Wilson (Erica Gavin, BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS) being ambushed with two male cohorts in crime by three really stupid policemen. This of course leads to her incarceration in a women's prison where you are apparently allowed to wear the same dress in which you were arrested (this should serve as a lesson to guys not to wear a dress when committing a crime). Others characters in this prison include a strict, wheelchair bound warden (Barbara Steele) a sadistic yet laughable doctor, and a mouthy badgirl (Juanita Brown) among others. During her stay Wilson will strip, get in a fight, get shock treatment, shower, break out of prison, rob a bank, and, the unthinkable, break back into prison. CAGED HEAT begins well enough with a stark contrast in both the direction and level of humor. Unfortunately it loses both after about twenty minutes as it tries to develop a more serious side. When this transformation in story and direction takes place the pace of the movie slows. Although there is a logical progression of continuity in its domino effect storyline, it is at times disjointed making the pace and story erratic. CAGED HEAT is a low budget effort where its budget at times shows through like the seams in a leisure suit. It does have the bonus of a southern fried soundtrack and some good humor here and there which help to lift it when the pace does not. Despite its pace and disjointed story, it is still entertaining for its 79 minute runtime and delivers quite a bit of nudity and other fare we look for in 'women in prison' flicks.--Bob",1107129600,10,1595,4.7
909952,5,6304564414,"Jonathan Demme made an intriguing movie around a women prison where he focused all his attention about the complex world of the human behavior , and its most intimate concerns .

That prison is a devastating metaphor of the real world : a microcosmos itself which reflect all the miseries , ambitions and distorted angles of the reality and its fellow perversions .

You notice the close relation between this work and other emblematic film of the sixties such Shock corridor was . The deep image of the world in those convulsive years where the anarchy , the uncertainness and the hopeless as always have accompanied the people in decisive historical turning points .

The state of insanity in many prisons all around the world has been subject of study and complex analysis . Since the exterted power on the prisioners have shown also the satiety the perversity which accompain too the Status Q and who , thanks the special profile they represent their unknown physical or mind facts exerted on the people are very often covered with the ancient pretexts such as *in the name of the science*  and other exquisite language modalities .

This film was filmed one year before One flew over the cuckoo's nest and somehow is engaged with a new world which emerged with new challenges and discoveries which literally shocked the world in that age .

In this sense the jump to freedom must be seen as expression of liberation and catharsis in the purest sense of the term.

The best proof this issue is far from being resolved is the fact the german emblematic film The experiment (see my review) which deals about related concerns , won the prize as best European film in 2001 .

Watch this film of a young (in that ages) but promising director Jonathan Demme , who proved with The silent of the lambs and Filadelfia what are the subjects that integrate his fundamental concerns .",1094688000,2,1876,4.698170731707317

For a cinematic debut, writer-director Jonathan Demme brings little style to this drive-in favorite. As the sadistic prison warden, Barbara Steele easily stands out among a mostly nondescript cast.
