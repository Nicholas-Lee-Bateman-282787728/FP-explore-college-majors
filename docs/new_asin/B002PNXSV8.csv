8377197,4,B002PNXSV8,"Why is an Australian video about an Australian ground-breaking photographer and cinematographer only available via aircraft delivery from far -off America? Jet fuel is expensive and contrails pollute the atmosphere. Globalisation is crazy. It is a very good documentary, but should be easily available in Australia.",1418947200,,315,5.869565217391305
8377198,5,B002PNXSV8,"brilliant camera work, brings the viewer into the scene.  Frank Hurley is best remembered for his iconic image of Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance beset by Antarctic ice, before going on to film combat in Europe during the Great War of 1914 to 1918.  Frank Hurley also filmed Douglas Mawson's 1912 expedition to Antarctica.  I enjoyed the experience of viewing this DVD and highly recommend that anyone interested in the development of cinematography, Polar exploration, history or adventure should view the rare footage contained on this DVD.",1374451200,,545,5.313953488372093
