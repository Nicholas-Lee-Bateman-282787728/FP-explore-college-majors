2469969,3,B000CQQIDA,"what striked me as surprising in this romcom is the sincerity on how the screenwriters sketched these characters...not in the ""i am here take me...i am the love of your life"" but on the more realistic as you can get in screen...sure there's the usual laws of romcoms in here...boy get dump, boy get bad date, boy meet girl, boy-girl falls in love....but in the mid-points of this you get not actors but real people with their real emotions...case in point, after a meeting with ex, boy runs to ""friend""'s house, instead of the usual crying and lets get to sex, its more like ""i am here to help you"" kinda vibe...which is refreshing....of course, you wanna take your romcoms with a grain of salt, but this one really trully uplifted the lameness that crosses the movie landscape (yes, i am talking to you elizabethtown!). the players: the star of numb3rs and milla ""resident evil"", and ex-mrs sheen all do excellent work...specially i was really feeling good that the leads had an awesome chemestry. you can feel it in the air...and funny thing, supporting cast...one of the balwins (awesomely bad boy with a love for his brother), and the friends of the lead (sorry i didn't caught their names) played pretty good as matchmakers...all in all, you're not going to take this for an oscar marathon, but surely right there in the top 10 romcoms in my list...

8100587,5,B000CQQIDA,I had seen this movie a few times before and knew it was a good story and that is the reason I ordered it so I could have my own copy. It is a good story,1476662400,,153,3.2777777777777777
8100588,2,B000CQQIDA,Bad movie all around.,1451779200,,21,4.5
8100589,4,B000CQQIDA,"I really enjoyed the film, the dvd was in great shape.  The arrival by mail was quick. Thankyou for that effort.",1401408000,,112,4.333333333333333
8100590,4,B000CQQIDA,All I can say is that the presence of Milla in this movie makes it a good movie.  If not for her great performance I would only give this movie 2 stars.,1395878400,,152,3.75
8100591,3,B000CQQIDA,"I  THOUGHT  IT  WAS  JUST  OK
BUT  NOT  EVERY  MOVIE  IS  GOING  TO
WOW  EVERYBODY  BUT  SHE  IS  STILL  VERY  PRETTY
MILA  JOCHOVICH",1392163200,,133,4.0
8100592,2,B000CQQIDA,"The film was decent- it is the typical romantic formula: girlfriend breaks up with guy, he is devistated, meets ""the One"", then almost blows it by pining after the other girlfriend who treated him badly.
I just feel the chemistry between the actors was not there.  I didn't believe the main actor as a strong leading man for the role.",1384300800,,334,4.566666666666666
8100593,3,B000CQQIDA,"If you are thinking of renting or purchasing this film, be advised that the promotional poster and DVD cover is deceptive. Denise Richards does not appear in those black leather pants or in any outfit that is particularly hot. On the other hand 2001 was the absolute peak of her attractiveness. She was into a serious fitness thing which brought her weight down, doing very good things for her face. And she was a good fit for the role, which capitalizes nicely on her Jane Russell/Megan Fox type negative charisma; and on Richard's own general vacuity.

The other casting choices were not as good. Writer/director Brian Burns is trying for the ""Annie Hall"" - ""When Harry Met Sally"" crowd and wants David Krumholz (Bernard of ""Santa Clause"" fame) to sell himself as a Woody Allen like nebbish in the middle of a love triangle with two extremely beautiful women. Unfortunately this oily actor looks like the sort of guy who would proposition your 14-year old sister. Not anyone you want to identify with nor anyone who brings out your sympathy vote.

Milla Jovovich is a talented actress who has appeared in way too many bad films; most much worse than this one. She is hopelessly miscast physically in ""You Stupid Man"" where her character's plainness is supposed to contrast with the dazzle of Richard's character. Despite this she manages to sell her character; although you never remotely buy into her love for ""Meet Me in St. Louis""; her rendition of ""The Trolley Song"" is genuinely painful. If you are a fan of that classic musical I suggest giving ""You Stupid Man"" a wide berth as Burns makes it the awkward leitmotif of the Krumholz/Jovovich relationship (insert ""yuck"" here).

Burns has written a decent script, a little light on comedy or at least comedy that works, but its social commentary gets high marks. Too much of a NYC consciousness probably hurts this thing with a national audience.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1252108800,,1948,4.788690476190476
8100594,4,B000CQQIDA,This was a good movie and there was some real chemisty between Milla and her awkward nerdy leading man who has a good heart but keeps putting his foot in his mouth. Baldwin and Denise Richards are an after thought and could have been played by anybody. Milla is the star and is perfect in this kind of role. This movie should have been released in the theaters in the states. She is a sweety.,1250553600,3,392,4.24
8100595,3,B000CQQIDA,"Sure, it's derivative. You've seen this story before. Maybe a hundred times. But this differs from the rest of the romantic comedies for one very big reason -- Milla Jovovich.

Jovovich is utterly charming throughout this movie. Until now, I knew her as a sci-fi action star and gorgeous model. But she shines in this film. Even when she's muttering the silliest lines fed to her by this so-so, been-there-done-that script, Milla is the ""real deal.""

I give this movie just three stars (based fully on Milla Jovovich's performance). She's so good, and I adored her so much in this movie, that I might just add it to my DVD collection. Even with only three stars.",1149120000,17,662,4.698275862068965
