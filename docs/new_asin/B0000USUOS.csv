8315574,5,B0000USUOS,"I was already familiar with this music from the festival in L.A having purchased the CD set.
It is a bonfide collector's item. Too bad that only day two was available. Highlight of the VHS version has to be Spock's Beard led by Neal Morse back when he still was with them(He's now a solo artist). One can only hope that this superb document of  Progfest '95 makes it to DVD someday. (Note: My copy does not include White Willow or Solaris. I received the VHS copy of Progfest '95 Day Two with Spock's Beard, Landberk, and Deus Ex Machina. Hope to get the version of the 'fest with White Willow and Solaris someday!",1259712000,,614,4.385964912280702
