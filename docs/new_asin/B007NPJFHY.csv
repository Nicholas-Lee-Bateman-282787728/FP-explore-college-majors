8519703,5,B007NPJFHY,"Includes both rest stop movies uncut! They are both identical to their individual blu-Ray releases. the first one comes with alternate endings and special features while the second one is bare bones. If you're a fan of these films like myself and already own the DVDs, the blu-Ray upgrade is a must! Very happy with this purchase!",1470614400,,330,4.807017543859649
8519704,5,B007NPJFHY,"The Rest Stop Series Is One Of The Most Misunderstood series out there, because the 1st film jumps right to it and not until the 2nd film do you get to fully understand the plot, regardless to say besides the actors themselves, the soundtrack is just as phenomenal and Rest Stop Dead Ahead has been within my top 5 since it was first released! the only bummer about the 2nd film is that Nicole is played by a different person and i really dislike when movies do that, i mean she looks similar but i feel the person who filled in for her didn't do justice, at all...besides that, the series is flawless and still one of my most favorite...EVER! otis is just a bonus, its a lot more of a comedy/tv show type of movie, nothing like rest stop but still genius!",1465516800,,756,4.293706293706293
