After seeing and listening to Teatro I went ordered the CD the next day.  There is not a bad song on  the whole thing.  The video is just as good and possibly more entertaining  as you can see as well as listen.  There is a song on this called I Just  Can't Let You Say Goodbye"".  it is the most beautiful song of murder I  have ever heard.  I know that sounds strange, but it is an incredible song.  It is a great video/CD for any mood.",951264000,18,555,4.037037037037037
7915672,5,B00002E208,We just watched this video on CMT and it is splendid.  For those Rumba dancers - this is great music to rumba to and just another side of the greatly talented Willie Nelson.,949708800,10,173,4.242424242424242
