8441438,4,B004UDQ7TG,"KARM was an average Hit in 1977 during the era of multi starrer and action movies. If the movie was made slightly earlier, it would have seen a bigger success. This movie made by the movie Mogul BR Chopra has Rajesh Khanna playing the role of a man torn between two women. The female leads are played by Vidya Sinha and Shabana Azmi, who do their roles well but the movie centers around Rajesh Khanna and the effect predictions can have. Ultimately predictions are proved wrong and prayer and Karm rule. A good movie made with good intentions and very well presented. The weak link is average music by R D Burman or may be the director did not create situations for a nice song. The lyrics are heavily loaded, however a charming and a good clean movie of the SuperStar.",1304467200,,769,4.460992907801418
