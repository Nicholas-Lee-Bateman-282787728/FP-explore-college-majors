8194752,3,6305793204,"This movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles if you turn it on.  Fu Sheng is always a great actor with great kung-fu choreography.  This film is a comedy more than it is a martial art movie and the story is simple.  Three trickster friends make money through fake fortune-telling work and risky gambling.  The wealthy local lord is somewhat of a ding-a-ling with a stutter and has two generals who are pretty much odd balls (like the three stooges), and they make money via bribes, threats and other fraudulent activities.  The three tricksters end up meeting a rebel, and the four together act as Robin Hoods and they came up with a plan to steal the lord's wealth from his vault.  During their getaway, they have to get pass the border where the lord's army has a fort.  On the other side, the rebels are waiting for the fortunes to arrive in order to fund the rebels.",1508457600,,874,4.493670886075949

8194754,4,6305793204,"Silly kung fu comedy, without a serious bone in its body. The comic action sequences are not as well-staged as the stuff Jackie Chan was just then beginning to put out, but the comedy still works and the four leads make for a very charming and entertaining bunch of heroes. This is definitely the most I've ever liked either Fu Sheng or David Chiang. Also, at least two of the soon-to-be Venom Mob are running around in the background, and I'm hoping re-watches will reveal that they're all there someplace. Not top-level Shaw Brothers, but among the best of their second-tier stuff, I would say.",1495152000,,596,4.685714285714286
8194755,1,6305793204,"I would say I'm a SB kung fu aficionado due to the fact I've seen my fair share of films from this production company. Sorry to say but this one falls very flat. David Chiang is a rich kung fu master but more like a Robin Hood type. Fu Sheng, Chi Kuan Chun & Li Yi Min are 3 vagabonds who also are skilled in martial arts. The two factions team up to help David Chiang regain his riches back after putting it for safekeeping with some of associates of his. The Manchus are dead on his trial & at one point gets their hands on the loot. The four martial artists then cook up several plans to retrieve the stolen riches.

The US cover for this movie is very inaccurate as it is a photo from Marco Polo which is a far superior film to this. David Chiang was subpar in this even with the elaborate weaponry of a bow & gold pellets that the Manchu soldiers try to pocket for themselves. Chi Kuan Chun was his usual stoic self, Fu Sheng was his comedic & trickery-filled self & Li Yi Min annoyed me with his constant flipping in nearly every scene. And their kung fu left me wanting because I've seen all 3 do much better in other efforts. The two captains of the guards (one of which was Shan Mao) were equally annoying falling for every trick the 4 laid out in front of them as well as their constant kowtowing before the emperor. Speaking of which, the emperor was a mumbling & stuttering mess who could only complete his thoughts in private but never in front of people. Before anyone gets too excited about a few Venoms (Chiang Sheng, Lu Feng, Kuo Choi) being in the credits, they're barely on the screen & when they are it's merely a shadow of the damage that they normally do. And the saddest irony is that the director of this atrocity is none other than...Chang Cheh. Yes the same Godfather of among SB movie directors, wow!

All in all, if you desire to sit down to watch it's about 90 minutes of your life that you wish you can get back in some kinda way...",1492646400,,1962,4.215425531914893
8194756,5,6305793204,"Magnificent moviie. David Chiang  plays  Chu Tie Xia ,  belonging to the privileged and "" high society "".  Because of this power, he is able to "" buy himself out "" from many  situations wherein he is to be arrested.  Deep inside, Chu Tie Xia's loyalty is with his oppressed people  against  the Mongol regime . Chu Tie Xia  is the eastern counterpart of Robinhood, sharing his wealth  and helping out his people.  A highly-skilled archer, Chu Tie Xia , uses  gold pellets as his ""arrows"".
  Meanwhile, three wanderers ; played by Fu Sheng, Chi Kuan Chun and Li Yi Min are also rebels and earn their living in fortune -telling and trickery. Each of these men have their own skills in kung fu , i.e.the young  Li Yi Min, is an agile acrobat. These three met and befriended  Chu Tie Xia, and  their loyalty to one another develops.  Because of this synchrony and friendship,, they were able to help the rebels fight against the Mongol regime. These men could have portrayed folk heroes during that time.",1489190400,,1000,4.553672316384181

8194761,2,6305793204,"The box art heralds that this movie stars Alexander Fu Sheng and David Chiang and ""features"" the Venoms.  This is not a Venom flick.  On the contrary, this is a shameless attempt to ""market"" the movie to Venom fans.  Make no bones about it... this is an Alexander Fu Sheng and David Chiang star vehicle with scattered unrelated bit part ""appearences"" of one or more later-to-be-known-as Venom actors.  In fact, the ""co-starring"" Venoms are won't to be found even in the opening credits.  This movie was made in 1977, one year before ""Five Deadly Venoms (1978)"" and probably before anyone knew what a ""Venom"" was.  Consequently, this is a decades later attempt to capitalize on the fascination with ""anything Venom.""  Even worse, this is not even a good Fu Sheng or David Chiang movie.  Still even worse, the production quality is fair to poor, with spotty bare bones color restorations and backdrops seemingly washed out and unrestored at all.  The audio track is only barely salvageable, with a pervasive backround ""buzzing"" and speech which is consistently mildly garbled.  When any of the actors are not speaking, you get the impression the producers squelched the audio track altogether to suppress the poor speech audio and redubbed the ambient backround noises.  On its merits as a kung fu flick, this is not a satisfying movie, with rudimentary uninteresting fight choreography, and I would recommend it only to avid Venom curiosity seeker collectors to catch a glimpse of a few actors ""before they were Venoms.""",988070400,7,1519,4.988095238095238
