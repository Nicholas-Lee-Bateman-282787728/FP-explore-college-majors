8147297,1,B000IT1Y9Y,"A pretty ordinary copy of an old video, the first show had terrible sound and poor picture quality.
The next show was ok, but there was very little real nostalgia drag racing footage,which was my main reason for buying the dvd.
Then there was a confusing show about economy runs that seemed like a school education awareness video that was quite frankly boring. never again",1313798400,2,373,4.753846153846154
