As this is a legit copy but for the wrong market which should of been stated it being japenese",1491177600,,312,4.288135593220339
8494117,3,B0066HZSKI,"First I want to make it clear: The series Hunter x Hunter is 5 stars plus. The reason I only put this as 3 stars is that it's Japanese with Japanese subtitles. Why in the world there would be Japanese subs on a Japanese video to the US market, I don't know. If you want an english version, this is not it. The series is 10 stars in my opinion and I encourage everyone to see it, just not this version unless you speak or read Japanese.",1410220800,49,435,4.011494252873563
