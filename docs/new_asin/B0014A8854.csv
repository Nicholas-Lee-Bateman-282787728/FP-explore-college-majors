8254766,5,B0014A8854,"If you've heard mention of this film, likely it was through an anti-Wal-Mart campaign. Perhaps you're a resident of a town unfortunate enough to be threatened by an influx of big box corporations. And yes, this film tells the inspirational story of small community in Maine that (somehow) successfully defeats Wal-Mart. But don't expect Ourtown to play as a how-to guide. Expect it to introduce you to a small town that must fight to define itself before it can defend itself. It's more than an anti-Wal-Mart film. It's an artful depiction of our endangered rural Americana.",1206576000,,574,4.989583333333333
8254767,5,B0014A8854,"Reality Show at its best.  Real, town, real people, real problem.  Wal-mart wants to come to town.  People organize and have a vote whether THEY WANT Wal mart to come to town.  The film follows all the complexity of individuals and community involved, creating both a extremely inspiring tale and 'how to' manual for small towns all over America who would like to have a say in their future.  I was deeply moved.  Highly recommended at this time in history when our values are rapidly being re defined.",1206489600,,502,4.6477272727272725
8254768,5,B0014A8854,"This is a little gem of a story: authentically told, artfully shot and fully laden with cultural and commercial significance for any community keen to retain its character and keep its financial health from being hijacked by Wal-Mart and its big box ilk.  Rarely in this bigger-is-better world do we see individuals band together to defeat the monolith, but it happened in Damariscotta, Maine.  You can look it up.  Better yet, buy the DVD, see how it was done, and do it in Your Town.",1206489600,,485,4.682352941176471
8254769,5,B0014A8854,"""OURTOWN "" recounts the community fight to defeat Wal-Mart's planned entrance into a small, coastal community in Maine. With eloquence and energy, this DVD describes the beauty of small town Maine and the spirit of the community that was able to beat back the giant retailer. You will cheer, you will cry, you will marvel at the level of committment by all involved. You will also get educated. This is a great DVD.",1206316800,,415,4.698630136986301
