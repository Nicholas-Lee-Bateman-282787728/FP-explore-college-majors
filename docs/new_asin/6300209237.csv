224665,5,6300209237,"Viva Max! has been one of my favorite films since I caught it on late-night TV in the 1970's.  The Mexican General (Ustinov) cannot impress his beloved by being just who he is, so he develops a plan to retake the Alamo to show her he does have the respect of his men.  Peter Ustinov, John Astin, Harry Morgan, Jonathan Winters, Keenan Wynn, Pamela Tiffon, Alice Ghostly, and Kenneth Mars make this one of the funniest films ever made.  I spent years trying to see it again.  When I found a VHS copy at a Four Star Video outlet I was ecstatic!  When they offered to sell me the one and only copy they had, I couldn't believe my ears.  I bought it and have been turning people on to this superb classic for over 20 years.  I've made a DVD copy and put the VHS away for safe keeping.  I see they're going for $30-$50 now.  I paid $6.",1149206400,8,830,4.1375
224666,5,6300209237,"With ""Viva Max!"" director Jerry Paris(best known for directing numerous episodes of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"")took the skills he had finely tuned for television(sharp, clever, fast-paced comedy)and brought them to The Big Screen.  What makes this film such a stand-out from his work in television is that he was successfully able to combine these said skills with social and political themes, creating a film that is both hysterically funny and fast-paced, yet filled with MUCH ""Food For Thought"".
As a person who hails from BOTH the cultures(Texas Anglo and Mexican-American)depicted in this story, I could relate to the REAL significance of this film.  Upon initial viewing, one may only see it as a clever, fast-paced comedy, well-acted by a STERLING cast(indeed, I think John Astin's performance as Sgt. Valdez ranks among the FINEST of his ENTIRE career).
Upon REPEATED viewings however, one can start to recognize FAR MORE to both script and cast of characters, than was initially apparent.  The DEPTH of personality(particularly in Astin's and Ustinov's characters)simply DEMANDS repeated viewings to REALLY appreciate.  They are complex:both inept and ludicrous, yet oddly courageous, stoic and ultimately WISE in their ""Military Conquest"" of Anglo-America!
Comedian Jonathan Winters turns in THE performance of a lifetime as the good-natured, befuddled brigadeer general of the Texas National Guard, chosen as a liason between the Mexican Army and the Texas Anglos.
Want to know what Texans are REALLY like?  FORGET ""King Of The Hill"" and WATCH THIS FILM!",1041465600,28,1563,5.389344262295082
224667,4,6300209237,"This was PBS' Jim Lehrer's first book. The movie, now a video, starred some greats of the past. One almost has to feel sad for General Maxmillian at the end of the story but he most certainly 'saves face' and becomes a  hero to his men. One of the most enjoyable  books I have ever read and  absolutely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. You'll watch it  again and again. Hope you'll tell me I was right!",922060800,20,414,4.1375
7804962,5,6300209237,"Fantastic what if story. The picked only serious actors for this politically correct film on manifest destiny. Peter Ustinov is General Maximilian Rodrigues de Santo. Although the story revolves around him many others help carry the story such as John Astin Sergeant Valdez who keeps the general out of trouble and Jonathan Winters as General Billy Joe Hallson of the National Guard.
This film was actually made in San Antonio. Written by Lehrer, James

Basic story is Mexican general is going to retake the Alamo as an act of heroism for his men.",1489881600,,547,4.881720430107527

7804964,5,6300209237,"I have always loved the comedy movie ""Viva Max.""  This older movie features a long list of talented stars:  Peter Ustinov, Jonathan Winters, John Astin, Keenan Wynn, Harry Morgan, Kenneth Mars, and more.  Pay attention to the soldiers and you'll notice some familar faces, actors before they were famous.

The story is the best part:  Max is a Mexican general, a gentle & honorable man, yet disrespected by his fiancee and his men.  As a descendent of General Santa Anna who had laid seige to the Alamo, Max is inspired to lead his men on foot to Texas to seize the Alamo and hopefully impress his fiancee.  His men believe they are journeying to participate in an American parade, and so they are well-equipped with musical instruments but no ammunition for their guns.  The unfolding story is both hilarious and touchingly sweet.

The DVD is Region 2--I wish I could have found a Region 1 DVD, but I am grateful to at least have a copy of the movie.  Quality is good--a little fuzziness, but this quality is typical for an older movie.  Languages are Spanish and, thankfully, English.  I wish there were English subtitles (only Spanish subtitles) as the sound, like the video, can sometimes be a little unclear.",1413763200,,1213,4.723809523809524

7804967,5,6300209237,"Marvelous comedy, almost forgotten and little regarded. A remarkable cast too: Peter Ustinov, a screen legend, perhaps best known for his roles as the Emperor Nero in the Biblical epic Quo Vadis? and Hercule Poirot in several movies, here plays General Maximilian Rodrigues de Santos, a Mexican general obsessed with re-taking the Alamo. His second-in-command is Sgt. Valdez, John Astin of Addams Family fame. Other luminaries include the legendary Jonathan Winters as General Billy Joe Hallson of the Texas National Guard, whose military career never included any action which didn't involve changing light bulbs; Keenan Wynn as General Lacomber, regular Army tasked with taking the Alamo back from General de Santos (Wynn may be best remembered as Col. ""Bat"" Guano in ""Dr. Strangelove""); Harry Morgan (Col. Potter, Joe Gannon) as Police Chief Sylvester; Kenneth Mars as Sam Gillison, leader of a local patriot militia (Mars is probably best known from ""The Producers"" as the German ex-soldier who wrote the original script of ""Springtime For Hitler""); character actress Alice Ghostley; and co-starred popular blond bombshell of the era, Pamela Tiffin.

Overall, Viva Max! is a broad military-political spoof as Gen. de Santos actually does re-occupy the Alamo, storming the gates moments before closing time, triggering a very minor international incident while holding two women (Tiffin & Ghostley) hostage, and demanding rather pompously to be put in touch with the Pentagon.

His plans for occupation receive their first setback when Sgt. Valdez informs him that none of the soldiers have ammunition: they entered the US under the pretext of marching in the Washington's Birthday Parade in Laredo, and even Valdez was under this impression. The extent of Santos' firepower is the revolver loaded with six rounds which they confiscated from Police Chief Sylvester at the beginning of their invasion.

The General assembles his men and finally addresses them with a grand speech, informing them that the ""Nord-Americanos"" have atomic bombs, ""hee-dro-hen"" bombs, flamethrowers, secret weapons, etc. etc. ""What do we have? Six bullets!"" He then makes them the same offer Col. Travis made to the original defenders of the Alamo, drawing a line in the sand and inviting anyone who did not want to stand and fight with him to step over it and run: with rather startling results!

Texas National Guard troops finally scale the walls. Because General Lacomber wanted to be sure there was no bloodshed, HIS orders were -- that the troops carry no ammo! A climactic standoff ensuses as the two armies face each other unflinchingly -- and effectively unarmed -- except for those six bullets . . .

This is a very funny movie. It was somewhat controversial even in its day, with Mexicans unhappy about the portrayal of their armed forces, and Texans unhappy about the very premise of the Alamo being retaken! It would likely draw more ire today for the fact that two of the leads wear dark makeup and speak with Mexican accents. So this is not a movie for the easily offended (also, Alice Ghostley's character is under the impression the whole thing is being staged by the Red Chinese, and calls her captor a ""pink Chink."") But if you can waive some of those sensibilities and just enjoy a good laugh -- and appreciate the flavor of the '60s -- you might love this movie.",1383350400,4,3363,5.063176895306859
7804968,3,6300209237,"This edition can play on a computer, but not a DVD player.  The film itself is fun to watch, not great.  The cast includes Peter Ustinov, Jonathan Winters, John Astin, and Pamela Tiffin (whom I remembered from Harper, with Paul Newman).  The music is Hugo Montenegro and Al Hirt, and I'm fond of both.",1368662400,,301,4.537037037037037

7804970,4,6300209237,"""Viva Max"" is an excellent comedy movie.  We used to have a copy and it disappeared so we ordered a used one from Amazon.  It arrived in good shape and we have enjoyed watching it again.  Thank you........",1242000000,,205,4.342105263157895
7804971,4,6300209237,"Others have mentioned outstanding performances by Peter Ustinov and Jonathan Winters. I'll also call out John Astin, Harry Morgan, Alice Ghostley and Keenan Wynn -- all fabulous character actors who add terrific depth to the film.

It's interesting that this '60s cold war spoof remains relevant today. Border security, illegal immigrants, right-wing paranoia and paramilitaries are all there, and all still in the news.

This is not a great comedy in the vein of ""Dr Strangelove"", but it's certainly a very good one, of the same quality as ""The Russians are Coming"".

Film gets four stars, but the VHS print gets three (or maybe two and a half). My complaint (and it's not a minor one) is that the VHS seems to have been made from the print edited for TV, and thus the word that the whole story turns on has been silenced in this version. The insult hurled at the general was that his men would not even follow him into a whore house. The word ""whore"" was cut out of this print, leaving a meaningless sentence and a weak insult that doesn't motivate the story. You'll have to fill in the word yourself, when the time comes.

Even with that glaring flaw, it's worth searching out the videotape. I don't know that this one would be attractive enough to a studio for reissue on DVD, but it would sure be nice to see it in widescreen, with better color and with the offending word restored.",1198713600,12,1387,4.580645161290323
