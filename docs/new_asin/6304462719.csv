8191353,5,6304462719,"When I saw this movie at the IMAX theatre I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie included some really great footage of the Alien Attacker from ID4. The footage shows the crew building the full-size ship that was used in the Area 51 hangar scenes. Thru time lapse photography you get to watch it built from the ground up. Quite a surprise let me tell you! If any of you bought and were completely disappointed by the model kit that was released depicting this ship then this sequence is a godsend. It clearly shows the front of the attacker (detail clearly missing in the model kit). So, if you have that model kit sitting around gathering dust on a shelf then buy this movie.",992995200,,686,4.4523809523809526
8191354,4,6304462719,"Behind the Scenes With King Kong in ""Special Effects"" was originaly produced by NOVA and even had a short run in IMAX theaters accross the country.  The movie focuses not just on the revolutionary  stopmotion animation techniques created by Willis O'Brien and model maker  Marcel Delgado (you even get to see the original 18"" armature they  designed for Kong), but also on the the special effects that were developed  as a direct result of this classic monster film.  Viewers who love King  Kong will enjoy seeing the painstaking detail the animators went to in  order to provide them with such a memorable movie-going experience and fans  of special effects films by such legends of the silveer screen as Ray  Harryhausen and Rick Baker will also enjoy this film.  The film can provide  a springboard to increasing a viewers understanding of special effects.  Newcomers to the study of SPFX and film making techniques will find this a  fun introduction. If I had one complaint about the movie it was that it was  too short, and all things considered, that is the best kind of complaint  for a reviewer to have.",962064000,6,1111,4.798941798941799
