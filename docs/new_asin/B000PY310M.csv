2828639,4,B000PY310M,"""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" is an anime series that combines elements of several other psychological/sci-fi anime head trip series of the past decade, such as ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" ""Serial Experiments Lain,"" ""Boogiepop Phantom,"" and ""X,"" but couches them all in the formula of a high school romantic comedy. It looks, feels and sounds like a teen comedy (excepting the occasional dimension-warping classroom battle), but the fate of the universe is at stake in practically every scene. And it's up to poor Kyon, an ordinary high school boy, with maybe a little more cynicism than most, to keep it all together. Why him? Because he's the one that Haruhi Suzumiya, his high-achieving, headstrong, easily-bored classmate, latches onto to keep her entertained and help carry out her mad schemes, which usually involve her interest in all things extraterrestrial, supernatural and paranormal. Oh, with a little cosplay thrown in. Kyon initially dismisses her as crazy, but, one by one, the three other kids that get roped in, all with secrets of their own, reveal that there's more to Haruhi than meets the eye.

In this volume, Kyon must contend with a pretty classmate's sudden homicidal bent; a cab ride through Tokyo with Itsuki, the ""esper"" in the group, who explains the ""human principle"" to Kyon and the danger of ""enclosed spaces""; a night spent in just such a space with Haruhi and the clues he's given to determine the one action that will save the universe in the nick of time; and a baseball tournament in which he must play on a motley team formed by Haruhi, with the implicit directive to win--or else!

Although the series relies on a lot of standard anime themes, it never fails to come up with one wholly original touch after another. (The high point of this volume is the confrontation in the ""enclosed space"" in episode 6, cited above.) The writing is especially sharp, and often quite funny, particularly in the clashes between the sardonic Kyon, who sees everything with a cold dash of reality, and fast-talking Haruhi, who shows an utter disdain for everyday reality. Japanese pop singer Aya Hirano provides the voice of Haruhi and does a great job of bringing the character to life and engaging the viewers just as wholeheartedly as Haruhi does the four members of her precious ""SOS Brigade."" The special features on this volume show the exceedingly cute Hirano in a ""Making of"" segment recording one of the songs for the soundtrack. Another ""Making of"" segment chronicles a photo shoot featuring her and the voice actresses who play the two other girls in Haruhi's circle, laconic bookworm Yuki Nagato and cosplaying cutie Mikuru Asahina.

I'm not sure what further unpredictable turns this series will take but I intend to be there for the whole ride.",1188000000,4,2784,4.957173447537473
2828640,5,B000PY310M,"I saw this show when it first came out as a fansub (recorded off Japanese TV and subtitled for English-speakers).  I love the show.  It's funny and clever and high-quality on the animation end.  It's got a lot of elements aimed at anime fans, but non-otaku will still enjoy it.

When buying this series, though, be careful, and here's why: Bandai has published two editions of the DVDS, origical broadcast order and chronological order.  Only certain boxed sets (2, 3 and 4, with specific labels) contain both versions, while some contain only the chronological order ones DVDs.

Personally, I prefer broadcast order.  Although watching the episodes without a sense of time line can be confusing, there IS a point to it.  The last broadcast episode - chronologically episode 6 - is the climax to the series, the one that explains everything that happens before and after its place in time.  What's the excitement of knowing that when you still have half a series to watch?  Especially the first time you see it.  Also, if you watch it chronologically, the series seems to end abruptly, whereas episode 6 provides some satisfaction as a conclusion. (e.g. ""Oooh, I get it now!"")

The broadcast-order DVDs are not available in the Japanese market, so in a way us US consumers should feel lucky.  This is a must-have series for anime fans, even if you're typically not into the magical girl/ surrealist/ high school-based genre.  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is definitely in a league of its own.",1186876800,23,1497,4.865612648221344
2828641,5,B000PY310M,"This show has everything, Girls, Guys, Aliens, Time Travelers, and Espers and more. Well worth the time and money spend getting it!",1186272000,,131,5.0
2828642,5,B000PY310M,"In the second volume of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya the story finally begins taking shape in the form of all the crazy characters surrounding Kyon showing their true natures. After being told by each of them that they are in fact aliens ESPers and time travelers he finally begins to see the proof in the pudding, so to speak.

I personally found this to be leagues better than the first dvd as far development goes, especially since the sixth episode does so much for the relationship between Kyon and Haruhi. It also sets up what will inevitably be an exciting third dvd by giving you small tastes of the extremes that they'll be put through. It gets a little annoying that Kyon has to to keep Haruhi in the dark about everyone's abilities, especially when she won't stop being a baby about how bored she is, but the show really rewards that train of thought when they show you just how scary her powers are.

The show also makes the requesite sports episode more interesting by adding in the quirks of each off beat character plus the sudden impending possibility that Haruhi might be getting bored again. Once Nagato decides to stop screwing around and use her powers she's a force to be reckoned with. Kyon also shows the possibility of cracking through Haruhi's shell when she actually starts listening to him.

All in all, the second volume doesn't disappoint while insuring that the third will be just as good if not better.",1185580800,3,1438,4.653543307086614
2828643,5,B000PY310M,"It maybe in a smaller box, but do not let that fool you about Volume 2 over Volume 1. If there is one item that puts it over the top, it's the arm band. DVD quality is as always wonderful and packaging is well done.",1185148800,3,215,3.8
2828644,5,B000PY310M,"This is one of the few anime series out there which dares to be diffent. The plot twists are many and it has many eliments of fan service and even mecha. The story dares to be diffrent becouse its shown from the third persons view point and leaves you guessing. I have been watching this seires from when it was a fan sub and now I own the DVDs. Its a sure hit for any Anime Otaku however the way the episodes are shown are rather strange.

I perfer the orginal broadcast versions of the episodes to the mix up order on the dubed DVDs. But worrie not they have even included the original TV version in the second and third DVDs as a bonus.

The extas that come with the Box set are top notch. Not many Anime series come with so many extras and even a CD! Dont let the price put you off from buying the box set its well worth it!

This is a BEST BUY!",1184803200,2,849,3.9823529411764707
2828645,4,B000PY310M,"The first disk was rather odd. Much of it didn't make any sense while other parts of it were simply confusing. The second installment had a couple of pretty clever twists and at least one laugh-out-loud scene. Someone was working overtime with their third year philosophy texts but it is worthy of watching.

I am now wondering if they can keep it up for awhile so I guess I'll be ordering each volume as it comes up.

Though the fan service is a bit heavy handed.",1184544000,2,464,4.383720930232558

8193706,5,B000PY310M,"The DVD arrived earlier than scheduled, it was in good shape for a used DVD. The price was excellent. The shipping cost is pre-set but reasonable. I look forward to purchasing more DVDs in the future.",1372809600,,200,4.583333333333333
8193707,5,B000PY310M,"My daughter loves this and has gone out and bought volume 1 of the series. She loves Anime to begin with
but was VERY happy with this edition!",1359417600,,142,4.107142857142857
8193708,4,B000PY310M,"(This review is for the 4 individual volumes as a whole)

The selling point for these DVDs is having to pay only a fraction for the set (Volumes 1, 2, 3 & 4) than what the single package costs AND coming with awesome keepsakes (including CDs!).  There is extra content but it's not that entertaining (behind the scenes live-action/American S.O.S. Brigade fan thing).  There's about 3 episodes per disc, with the second disc containing the original broadcast order in Japanese with English subtitles.

Also note - this is only season 1 - there is a season 2 that happens simultaneously among these episodes that you should also check out (just mind the infamous 'Endless Eight' section :P)",1357516800,,688,4.854700854700854
8193709,5,B000PY310M,"6 bucks from warehouse deals for a brand new, sealed anime? heck yes!
You get 4 episodes and the intro song for the anime, both of which I enjoy quite a bit!
If you're a fan of the show, it should be a no brainer to buy this limited edition for only $6 before Amazon jacks the price up or runs out!",1339286400,,298,3.8225806451612905
8193710,5,B000PY310M,"In short, i bought this because the complete first season was just as expensive as buying the indvidual LEs. the art box isn't as good of quality as i was hoping (compared to lucky star art box). the bonus items were very cool though. LE contains DVD, cosplay armband, iron on, 2 sided pencil board, and a cd. its not wonderful, but its pretty good for the price.",1337904000,,363,4.352941176470588
8193711,5,B000PY310M,"If you're an Anime Otaku (and you understand what an Anime Otaku is) then this series is for you. This review concerns Volume 2 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

BLUF: Worth every penny

Details: If you're reading this - then you already know the story behind this anime. (If not, I won't spoil the series here.) Watching this series in Broadcast Order is essential to appreciating it.  Volume 2 of the Limited Edition box set includes a second DVD with the second installment of the series in Broadcast Order (sorry Dub Fans, it's Subtitled Only). It also includes a CD with Music from the series that is actually an imported version of a CD sold on the open market in Japan - and if you like the music in this show, you'll want this CD. Finally, there's beautifully drawn insert that has the show's characters in various poses on both sides that's printed on plastic (the pencil board mentioned in the description and it's actually very nice) and other goodies in the box.

So is it worth paying extra for this version versus the Regular Edition? ABSOLUTELY. It's actually a great value:
-Same DVD you get with the regular edition (price varies - but $26 as of this writing)
-Vol. 1 of the series in Broadcast Order (not available anywhere else - even Japan)
-Bouken Desho Desho CD Single (about $25 from Amazon Japan depending on the Dollar/Yen rate)
-Other goodies thrown in for good measure

The Bouken Desho Desho CD Single contains:
-Bouken Desho Desho - the full version of the opening song used in the Anime Series
-Kaze Yomi Ribbon (The Ribbon for Reading Wind)- the full version of the opening song for the radio drama series broadcast in Japan
-Karaoke Versions (No Vocals) of the above songs - so you can embarass yourself in the privacy of your car

Finally, if you haven't watched this series yet - there's enough depth to this show that you'll get something different out of every viewing.

This series has my strongest recommendation.",1315785600,2,1956,4.685131195335277
8193712,1,B000PY310M,"The box had dented. Because I want to ventilate grievances to amazon, a letter has not been opened yet.",1238803200,,103,4.473684210526316
8193713,5,B000PY310M,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is one of my favorite anime series. It has plenty of comedy but isn't without it's serious moments. This anime is based on a series of novels, but if you think books are boring, don't think for a minute that this will be too!
  The second disc on the limited edition has the episodes in broadcast order rather than chronological order. (The regular edition only has chronological order). I think it's best to watch in broadcast order because otherwise the climax is in the middle instead of the end. It can be a little confusing that way, but if you watch it a second time then you pick up on extra nuances.
  Anyway, I wholeheartedly reccomend The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.",1210636800,,713,4.634920634920635
8193714,5,B000PY310M,I loved this anime and I suggest to all readers to watch the second disc with it's odd episode order.  This is the broadcast order and I think adds a lot to the show.,1188086400,5,166,3.8823529411764706
