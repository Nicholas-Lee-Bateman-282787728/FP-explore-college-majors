8153557,5,B000JX7RH2,"I taped this from WTTW in Chicago years ago, but lost it. It has the most awsome photography, as well as superb playing of the Vivaldi Four Seasons. I do so wish they would redo it in DVD HD! All the work that must have gone into making this! The city of Chicago should sponsor that! It really shows what an incredible this city is! A very personal view- the museums, trees, parks, flowers, people, and of course our varied weather!",1389398400,,432,4.345679012345679
8153558,5,B000JX7RH2,"My husband and I were up late one evening during ""pledge weekend"" and they played this...and we were intrigued, and LOVED it!!!  It's obviously the ""Four Seasons"" by Vivaldi, but the music is set to gorgeous images of the City of Chicago during said season, IE, Autumn showing how Chicago looks around Halloween, Thanksgiving as the leaves are all falling, etc..., Winter to the Christmas snowy images of a frozen Chicago.  It IS glorious, it's beautiful and a must have for ANY Chicagoan....and I cannot BELIEVE I found it on amazon.com!!!",1294185600,3,540,4.923076923076923
