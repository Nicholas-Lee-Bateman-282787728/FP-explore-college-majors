1622786,5,B00005LOLJ,"Well kidies, I have the inside scoop and what I'm about to do is give you a little insight into the the new ECW DVD entitled Hardcore History coming out in stores in August. This DVD will cronicle the best of ECW from 94-95. Why they make us wait so long for the release of ECW DVD's is anybodys guess. Well enough of me rambling, on with the matches.....
1. Public Enemy vs. Terry Funk & Dory Funk  (Barbed Wire Match: This is a great bloody match which ends with all the fans throwing their chairs into the ring)
2. Cactus Jack vs. Sabu (The two hardcore legends battle it out to see who's more hardcore! This match is just brutal and that's why you'll want to watch it over and over again)
3. Taz & Sabu vs. The Malenko Brothers (A great match which ends with the Public Enemy coming out and destroying Taz, Sabu, and Paul E.)
4. Tommy Dreamer vs. Raven (Perhaps the greatest feud in ECW history as both men battle for a title shot against Sandman in a no countout or DQ match where anything goes)
5. Terry Funk vs. Sabu vs. Shane Douglas  (The original 3-Way Dance that put ECW on the map....One hour long....Enough said)
6. Cactus Jack vs. Terry Funk  (The most brutal ECW match ever! Cactus gets bottles broken over his head, and Funk lights him on fire and blows a huge fireball at him)
7. Rey Misterio vs. Psicosis (The rematch that everyone was waiting for, where both men collided in a Mexican Death Match that went all over the ECW arena)
Special Features:
1. The interview that started it all, where Shane Douglas throws down the NWA Title belt.
2. Extreme Moments Montage.
3. Wrestler Biographies and interviews.",991785600,5,1625,4.4280936454849495
1622787,4,B00005LOLJ,"Alright, more ECW DVD action here. Hardcore History is not the best ECW Video released by any means, but it is one of the better compilations they have out there. The matches, with year in parentheses:
1. Sabu & Taz Vs. Dean Malenko & Chris Benoit ('95): Great tag match with four guys who can really mix it up in the ring. Taz looks silly back in those tasmaniac days. Lots of brawling involved.
2. The Gangstas (Mustafa & New Jack) Vs. The Eliminators (Perry Saturn & John Kronus)-  Tag Titles Cage Match. ('96):  The bloodiest and most brutal cage match i have ever seen. More action than WWE's Hell in a Cell offerings thus far. Saturn goes to the top of the cage like, 6 times in this match. Kronus and the Gangstas bled like crazy too!. Gangtas retained their title in the end.
3. Raven &Steven Richards Vs. The Pitbulls- Double Dog Collar Tag Titles match ('96): Beulah McGillicuty made the match 2 out of 3 falls after declaring Stevie ineligible to wrestle due to a broken neck. He wrestled anyways, as the match progressed. Great action throughout, and crazy bumps for each fall. Pitbulls retained, after help from a legendary Innovator of Violence.
4. Shane Douglas Vs. Pitbull #2 ('96): Pitbull 1's neck was broken by DOuglas, so we got this revenge match. Lots of brawling in this one.
5. Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) Vs. The Sandman (Cane Vs. Barbed Wire Match) ('97): Brutal match with lots of bumps taken by both men. Douglas' interference ruined the end, though.
6. Rob Van Dam Vs. Sabu- Stretcher Match ('96): The best match out of these two best friends and legends before they clashed for the TV title a couple of years later. Plenty of high spots from the two, and scary moments, too. Nice to see RVD in his old ECW days. He even did a Van Daminator!. That was cool. Sabu wins it here.
7. Rey Misterio Jr. Vs. Juventud Guerrera ('96): A great lucha match with lots of flying and lots of submission holds. Oh yeah, it was 2/3 falls too. Rey won it in the end.
8. Tommy Dreamer Vs. Brian Lee- ""High Incident"" Scaffold match ('97): Imagine...about 20 tables stacked high in the ring, and a scaffold high above it that one of the wrestlers must pushed his opponent out of to get the win, and you've got this match. Slow at times, but picked up in the end. Nasty bumps here, the ending being the worst, of course. The Innovator of Violence takes the ""W"" here.
 Overall, a good DVD for hardcore wrestling fans, or anyone who wants to get into ECW in its early days. The extras are pretty cool too. SO, get it, and learn your history here!",1037923200,2,2549,4.453961456102784
1622788,3,B00005LOLJ,"This review refers to the VHS version of ECW History, not the much better DVD version. If you have a DVD player, then buy ECW History on DVD. I bought this video on VHS and it wasn't too good. But on the DVD version, you'll get better bloodier matches including: the barbed wire match between Cactus Jack & The Sandman, and the ""stretcher match"" between Rob Van Dam & Sabu. Believe me, the DVD version is a heck of a lot better than the VHS version! In my opinion, the VHS version gets only 3 stars, while the DVD version gets 5 stars. Still, a few of the matches on this ECW video stink. But the scaffold match between Tommy Dreamer & Big Diesel, the stretcher match between RVD & Sabu, the cage match between The Eliminators & The Gangstas, and the barbed wire match between Cactus Jack & The Sandman are all worth seeing. Buy this on DVD. You'll be glad you did.",1035936000,,865,4.280487804878049
1622789,4,B00005LOLJ,"Actually i rate it 4 1/2 . You get a great deal here and awesome innovative action! Anyways here's the matches and ratings and these matches took place during the Bret Hart era and when Hogan just got into WCW. It's hard to believe that this tiny company in south philly produced some of the greatest matches ever.
- ECW World Tag Team Champions Sabu & Taz vs. Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko : 2 Decent match but for feb. 95 this is great.
- ECW World Tag Team Champions The Gangstas vs. The Eliminators - Weapons cage match : 3 Saturn is the number one player here as he jumps off the top off the cage about six times i think! Everyone bleeds, violent match. Not much wrestling but it is a war!
- ECW World Tag Team Champions Raven & Stevie Richards vs. The Pitbulls - Two out of Three Falls, Double Dog Collar Chain Match: 3 2/3 : a wild match full of choas and more. Tables everywhere and just free for all action.
- ECW World Television Champion Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 - August 3, 1996- 3 1/2 I liked this match as it had old school wrestling,hardcore,brawling,huge moves and a ending that will get you angry! Pitbull 1's neck was broken a night earlier by the Franchise and sits and hopes his partner seeks revenge.
-DVD only- ECW World Champion The Sandman vs. Cactus Jack - Singapore cane vs. Fist wrapped in barbed wire match: 2
Weaker match but cool spots.
DVD only - Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu - Stretcher Match :4 great match,hardcore all the way.
Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Juventud Guerrera - Two out of Three Falls 5++ : Lucha libre at its ultimate maximum mayhem. Scientific,extreme lucha libre,hardcore,backlot brawl and these guys did all of it in about 15 minutes.
 Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee - High Incident Scaffold Match - October 26, 1996 :In my opinion worst match on the DVD *1/2 plus the fall by Lee was not that spectacular,it seems it would awesome to see a guy fall from that height through 3 tables but he was hanging off and only a piece of the second table and a tiny bit of the 3rd broke.
DVD EXTRAS:
Extreme Moments : guy breaks his leg,jt smith messes a spot,new jack dives.

Overall: This easily surpasses Deep Impact and Xtreeme Evoulution and could be tied with P.O.D. It has something for everyone and its a history lesson of a lifetime!",1027209600,,2364,4.43448275862069
1622790,5,B00005LOLJ,"This video was pretty cool. Not as good as Ultimate Street Brawls
But I enjoyed it as far as wrestling tapes go.",1018656000,,112,4.136363636363637
1622791,3,B00005LOLJ,"The matches:
1. Benoit/Malenko vs. Sabu/Taz ****1/2
A fun, fast, match. Benoit and Malenko ingeniously help Sabu and Tazz to the best performances of their career, by beautifully controlling the flow of the match allowing Taz and Sabu to get quick well timed bursts of spots and high impact moves. Benoit closes the match with a great superbomb spot on Sabu. Best match on the DVD.
2. The Gangstas vs. Elimantors *
This match is terrible. They basiclly walk around the ring cutting themsleves with hidden razors. Saturn jumps off the cage a bunch of times to keep the audience from going to sleep. But it doesnt work. features deadly weapons like a keyboard too. Bad Ending too.
3. Raven/Stevie Richards vs. The Pitbulls ****1/4
Once again a fun and entertaing spot fest. It also managed to wrapup a bunch of angles at once. This gives the match its legenardy status as one of the best booked matches in history. Lots of people get involved which may confuse someone new to ECW or unaware of the angles at the time. Still the endless spots will keep you interested.
4. Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull2*3/4
Starts off good with Pitbull targeting Shanes neck with cool moves like a Tombstone, DDT, Brainbuster and a neckbreaker.  Sadly they decide to walk around the arena for about 10 mins softly patting each others backs with chairs and what not, putting me to sleep.  Pitbull does a brutal blade job(blood is cool), as the match sluggishly drags on to one of the most anti-climatic and dumbest endings in wrestling history.
5. Rey Mysterio JR. vs. Juventud Gurerra****
Lots of cool fast paced spots. Some decent mat wrestling and brawling too.  Very Entertaining match.
6. Tommy Dreamer vs. PrimeTime*
Not a match at all, just a big bump by Prime Time.
RVD vs. Sabu**
Slow boring match with some good spots that make it watchable.  But about 75% of the match is them setting up a spot or them resting after a spot. Excellent example of poor match pacing.
Foley vs. Sandman**1/4
This like a T.V. Raw match or something. It has promise, but seems very rushed. Nothing is given proper time to develop. The match suddenly and disappointally ends with a Shane Douglas runin.
Overall 3 awesome matches, 2 average matches, 2 bad matches, and a sick bump. Everything is watchable though. This is the 2nd best ECW DVD available. If you like your wrestling fun, give it a try. If you want scientific mat wrestling, look elsewhere though. Even the best matches on this DVD are spotfests with little wrestling.",1013817600,2,2494,4.726436781609196
1622792,4,B00005LOLJ,"I think if I had been a die-hard ECW fan since it's inception in 1994, I would have appreciated the significance of this DVD.  Each match took place before 1996 when ECW was desperately trying to make a big name for itself.  And most of the matches reflect this.
Since I am a Hardcore wrestling fan more than a technical wrestling fan, I will start with the blood and guts matches.  Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee is a 1 star match with a 5 star ending.  To watch Lee get dropped from a 25 foot high scaffold onto a zillion tables sitting in the ring is worth sitting through 15 minutes of nothing.  Cactus Jack vs. Sandman is alright, mainly because it's unbelievable what punishment Mick Foley could take in his heyday.  And the incredible ""Stretcher Match"" featuring a young Rob Van Dam vs. an aging Sabu would probably get 5 stars from the brainwashed ECW masses, but as an objective viewer, it gets 3 stars.  The match is too long, which is the case with most of Rob Van Dam's matches, and ends when Sabu does some sort of flip onto the padded stretcher and is too hurt to get back up.  This after doing flips onto concrete, steel barriors, and getting beat with chairs.  It doesn't make much sense.
The significance of the rest of the DVD is lost on me because I have never been a hardcore fan.  The wrestling is great because Perry Saturn, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, and Shane Douglas are all featured.  But I guess I just didn't appreciate this DVD as much as I should.",1013817600,,1475,4.386029411764706
1622793,4,B00005LOLJ,"This is my 1st ECW dvd i purchased.
This DVD featured some great matches from 95-96 and these matches where great for back then. You look at a wwf match at 1995 or 96 and take alook at at the lucha libre, dog collar match and rvd vs sabu and you would be thinking why a company that puts on classic matches for back then be so small?? i dunno.
The 1st match is a tag match with benoit and melanko vs sabu and taz. Although nothing much happen until the end when sabu started flipping out the ring and a nice powerbomb.
***stars
The 2nd match the gangsterz vs the eliminators. Not as good as i thought it would be. Saturn does a few dives off the cage but after about 3 it is nothing special. Not much wrestling but it is hardcore.  **1/2 stars
The 3rd match is raven & stevie Richards vs The pitbulls. This match was pretty cool with a few tables. Stevie wears the crimson mask and raven does a excellent piledriver through a table. Honestly ive never seen a pile driver like it. Also Raven took a big bump as he went to get powerbombed but his body missed the table except for the back of his head and neck, the table doesnt break but the impact of it spins it around OUCH.
****stars
The 4th match was Shane douglas vs Pitball 2. A boring match where nothing happened. Pitball 2 does bleed alot but with just 2 guys punching each other this only gets *1/2 stars.
The 5th match is Rey Miserio Jr vs Juventud Guererra.
Possible the greatest match on here. This was my first Lucha Libre so i thought it was a great match. It was a very fast paced match up with fast paced wrestling and high flying monouvers this scores a nice ***** stars. Extremely good wrestling.
The 6th match is Tommy Dreamer vs Prime time Brain Lee.
This was a high scaffold match....You have to pucsh your opponent off the scaffold to win the match and below them is tables stacked up on eac other.
*star for the match **** star for the ending
Bonus DVD match: Cactus Jack vs The Sandman.
This is a cane vs fist wrapped in barb wire match. Pretty boring which i fast foward through the match **star
Bonus DVD match: Rob Van Dam vs Sabu
This is a stretcher match which is is enteraining especially for back then. Although i thought this match would have been better then people went on about, but still was pretty good and they both put alot of work in to it. Sabu does a moonsaut onto te stretcher and hits his legs on the gaurd rail,ouch and also a nice table spot.  ****stars
SPECIAL FEATURES: Extreme moments montage:J.T smith  gets his knee pad caught on the ring ropes and hits his head on concrete and you see his head swelling before he gets up, a new jack dive, and a big guy jumping off top rope landing on 1 leg and his shines snap...u can hear and see his shine snap. OUCH!!!!!!!
You see wrestler bios, Promos, from austin and an encounter between franchise and pillman. Also a pillman promo. And a hilarious promo mistake by franchise and a spray can that doesnt work. It is hidden and i forgot how to find it but some has it on here.
Overall this is a nice dvd for ECW fans, I am  not dissapionted whit this, but if you want to get into ECW i would try a newer ECW dvd such as Heatwave 98 or Extreme evolution as these matches are old and are realy for people who have followed ECW  for many years but didn't get to see its golden era.
Recomended",1011225600,,3330,4.221350078492936
1622794,5,B00005LOLJ,"What can I say?  With the WWF the only company left, it seems we can only look to ECW DVDs to remember why we liked wrestling in the first place.  Don't expect to see people dancing around the ring with their pants down, people's eyebrows or 3 minute matches.  This is wrestling.  NOT sports entertainment.",1010361600,,306,4.509090909090909
1622795,4,B00005LOLJ,"This DVD is pretty good, but the quality of the shows aren`t that great. It`s like watching an Indie fed, but the matches are still pretty good, old, but pretty good.
Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko vs. Sabu & Taz(2/25/95): Man, does Taz look rediculous (Actually Made To Look Like The Tazzmanian Devil!), while the match was ok, we seen an appearances by 911, and The Nasty Boys. (3.5/5 Stars)
The Gangstas vs. The Eliminators(8/24/96): This match was in a steel cage. Saturn took so many dives it wasn`t even that exciting anymore. Match made everyone bleed. Weapons Included: Tables, Chairs, a Computer Keyboard, a Knife, trash cans, and much more weapons. (4/5 Stars)
Raven & Stevie Richards vs. The Pitbulls(9/16/95): This was from what I seen a pretty good match, and not many people liked in on this board. 2/3 Falls, because it was reported that Richards had a broken arm, but Pitbull #1 fetched Stevie from the back and brought him out. Tables, Chairs, are involved in this match. (4.2/5 Stars)
Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2(8/3/96): Pitbull #2 is out to seek revenge on ""The Franchise"" for breaking Pitbull #1`s neck. Lots of blood shed by Pitbull #2, and he certainly looked fatigued. I think he bladed wrong, because the blood was coming out like a faucet. Pretty Good Match. (4/5 Stars)
Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman(7/1/95): This match is Singapore Cane vs. Fist wrapped in Barbed Wire. Match is pretty good, but could have been better. Sandman does quite a few of aerial technics, which is always good from the fist fighter. (4/5 Stars)
Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu(8/3/96): This match is a Strecther Match up. It shows why Sabu is called ""the Human Highlight Reel"" as he was AWESOME in this match. RVD wasn`t the RVD we see today. He hadn`t discovered the thumb pose and really didn`t have much Signature Manuevers. I didn`t like the fact that they had to keep bringing Sabu or RVD back after practically every move, but some insane stuff happened outside the ring. Not a bad ending either! (4.5/5 Stars)
Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Juventud Guererra(3/9/96): Rey Misterio(Mysterio) still had his signature mask that he wore in WCW in this match, while the rest of his outfit was out dated, and wasn`t wore in his time of WCW. Juventud didn`t have any signature gear, as he did in WCW, and his mask was completly different. This match stole the show, and swear to god this is one of the best matches I have ever seen from any luchadores. This match topped anything they did in WCW, and made me hate it when they ended the match. Rey Misterio is the new ""Human Highlight Reel"" you never seen him do the same move twice. Juventud is no slouch either. This blew all of the other Luchadore matches out of the ring, especially the Tajiri vs. Psicosis - Which I thought was pretty crappy. All In All, Best 2/3 Falls Match, I Have Ever Witnessed! (5+/5 Stars)
Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee(10/26/96): Pretty decent match, but could have been way more hardcore than this, and to go from an Extreme Luchadore 2/3 Falls Match to this is unprecidented! This match wasn`t all that good, besides the ending which I`ve seen worse, and on top of that barely any wrestling just brawling.(3.5/5 Stars)
All in all I would get this DVD just for the Rey Misterio vs. Juventud Guererra match, because you won`t regret it! But if you are not into those type of matches (Which I doubt you won`t be after you see this!) then definetly get a different DVD. Everyone made a big hype about this DVD, and was let down because of it when I got it. It`s a weaker DVD than the rest, but anything ECW puts out is better than the WWF.",1009756800,,3593,4.580745341614906
1622796,5,B00005LOLJ,This is one of the best wrestling DVD's ever. Most of these guys are now being wasted in the WWF but on this disc they shine like the wrestling superstars that they are. You owe it to yourself to get this one.,1008028800,,209,4.0
1622797,5,B00005LOLJ,"This DVD is amazing and entertaining.  It shows the early years of ECW.  The promotion that changed wrestling and was the home to some of the most memorable acts and moments in professional wrestling history.  WWF has never had wrestling like this.  Back in ECW they had very limited space to wrestle so they really had to make due.
Taz and Sabu Versus. Sabu  Very good match.  Taz does some great suplexes and Sabu goes crazy in the last 10 minutes by going crazy with the dives from the ring to the floor.  Killer ending and very interesting angle with Publi Enemy  4 stars
Pitbulls Versus Raven and Stevie Richards.  Hard fought match and maybe one of the greatest matches of all time.  Great moves through tables.  A lot of wrestlers invovled and killer powerbombs.  5 stars
Sabu Versus Sabu.  Maybe their greatest match, even better then Lynn and RVD.  A lot of top rope spots, but not many table spots.  5 stars
Rey Misterio Versus Juventud  The greatest one on one  Luchador Match of all time.  Enough said 5 stars
Pitbull versus Shane Douglas  Very good match and really bloody.  Unfortunately, I'm getting tired of the Pitbull versus Shane Douglas.  4 stars
Da Ganstas versus Eliminators.  Just one thing, what the hell is Saturn doing with moppy?  This shows his true talent and why he maybe could have been the greatest wrestlers of all time.  Never saw so many dives off a cage.  Disappointed at New Jack.  Okay weapons but good fight.  4 1/2 stars
Sandman versus Cactus Jack  Slow match.  So pretty good spots and is pretty good.  4 stars
Dreamer versus Brian Lee  Okay match but the fall will keep you breathless. 4 stars",1005091200,,1635,4.592334494773519
1622798,4,B00005LOLJ,"First, let's get to the match reviews..
*May Contain match spoilers*
----------------------
Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko vs Sabu & Taz
It's odd to see Taz with curly hair and no boots.. Thankfully, he still had all his awesome suplexes in this match. Before the match, PE and Malenko/Benoit had a showdown.. I don't know what that was all about, but a nice solid, long match.
Rating: 4/5
----------------------
The Gangstas vs The Eliminators
Lots of brawling in the beginning, with some nice dives by Saturn. Too bad Saturn doesn't go much to the top anymore.. Okay match, but nothing to get excited about.
Rating: 3/5
----------------------
Raven & Stevie Richards vs The Pitbulls
Nice match, with alot of tables, although some botched. I'm surprised Raven was able to Piledrive Pitbull #2 through that table without it giving way.. Tables now, they'll either break on you too quickly, or not break at all.
Rating: 4/5
----------------------
Shane Douglas vs Pitbull #2
Shane got LOTS of heat. I have never seen that kind of heat before. Shane plays a good heel, and can also take a beating. Long, bloody, solid match. I actually liked this one.
Rating: 5/5
----------------------
Rey Misterio Jr. vs Juventud Guerrera
I forgot Juvi even wore a mask.. Nice high flying/technical match with good spots. Rey and Juvi in their prime.
Rating: 4/5
----------------------
Tommy Dreamer vs Prime Time Brian Lee
Either Brian Lee was putting his ""Brick Wall"" impression off very well, or this guy does NOT know how to sell. Bunch of stupid fans in this one, too. I think at one point while Dreamer/Lee are brawling, Dreamer shoves a group of fans down.. but, they deserved it. Just watch the brawling at the beginning, and you'll see.
Rating: 3/5
----------------------
Cactus Jack vs The Sandman
I've never really liked Foley.. I don't know why he's so great. And he proves that to me more in this match. OK match, but overall, a bit slow.
Rating: 3/5
----------------------
Rob Van Dam vs Sabu
I really don't know about this match.. I like ANY match that involves Sabu/RVD, but, this one was a bit short, and not many good high-flying moves were pulled off. RVD looked incredibly sloppy. Not Sabu or RVD's best match.

1622803,5,B00005LOLJ,"With the resurgence of ECW in the public eye on WWF television, more casual wrestling fans may find an interest in learning about the revolutionary promotion that changed the face of sports entertainment in the mid to late `90s.  ECW Hardcore History highlights 8 of the greatest matches and superstars in ECW history during its golden era of 1995-1996.  Also included in the ""DVD Special Features"" are promos, wrestler biographies and another ""extreme moments"" montage and yes, ANOTHER hidden promo.
Here are the matches featured on this release:
1. ""Crippler"" Chris Benoit and ""The Shooter"" Dean Malenko vs. Taz and Sabu (2/25/95):  For the ECW Tag Team Titles.  Solid (albeit lackluster) scientific contest on the part of Benoit and Malenko.  Also appearing:  The Public Enemy and 911!!! 3  stars
2. The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) vs. The Eliminators (Perry Saturn and John Kronus) (8/24/96):  Cage Match for the Tag Team Titles.  This was an intense bloody brawl that spanned the arena, featuring foreign objects and TONS of cage dives (and as is the custom with Gangsta matches, Dr. Dre pounding on the sound system).  Also appearing:  ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas!!! 4 stars
3. The Pitbulls (Gary Wolfe and Anthony Durante) vs. Raven and Stevie Richards (9/16/95):  Double Dog Collar 2/3 Falls for the Tag Titles.  This single match has been touted by MANY as THE greatest match in ECW history, both in terms of storytelling and physicality.  All-Out WAR between these two teams featuring dog collars, lots of tables and LOTS of guest appearances by:  The Dudley Boyz (Dudley, Dances With and Big Dick), 911, Referee Bill Alphonso and Tommy Dreamer.  The first two falls seem to have been slightly clipped, but the 3rd fall is probably THE MOST INTENSE moments you'll ever see in a wrestling ring.  5 stars.
4. Pitbull II vs. ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas (w/Francine) ( 8/3/96):  Pitbull I gives his retirement speech before the match.  Hard fought back and forth brawl matching Pitbull's awesome power vs. Douglas' finesse.  Everything except the kitchen sink was used in this hardcore battle. 4  stars.
5. The Sandman (w/ Woman) vs. Cactus Jack (7/1/95):  For the ECW Heavyweight Title.  Slow paced but brutal brawl between the two Hardcore Icons.  Lots of caning; lots of barbed wire.  Also featuring:  Shane Douglas and 911.  3  stars.
6. Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu (8/3/96):  Stretcher Match.  As Joey Styles would say, OH MY GOD!!! The object in this match was to beat your opponent so senseless that they had to be carried out on a stretcher to the back.  Hands down this is one of THE best matches I've ever seen.  In one for the highlight reel it's all-out aerial/martial arts war between two of ECW's best and most popular workers.  Brutal.  5 stars.
7. Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Juventud Guerrera (3/9/96):  Extreme Lucha Libre!!!  2 out of 3 Falls.  Before they became mainstays on Monday Nitro, Rey Rey and Juvi lit up the house in ECW.  This is probably THE best lucha match I've ever seen, and that says A LOT.  If they showed matches like this every Monday night I'd be really happy.  It's a back and forth air war in ring (and across the arena) between the two most well-known luchadors in America.  5 stars.
8. ""The Innovator of Violence"" Tommy Dreamer vs. ""Primetime"" Brian Lee (10/26/96):  ""High Incident"" Scaffold Match.  Hard-hitting arena spanning brawl VERY notable (and notorious) for its EXTREMELY brutal ending.  3 stars for the match, 5 stars for the ending!!!
In addition to these 8 matches, the DVD also includes these special features.
1. Wrestler bios written by Michael Johnson II, of [...]  the same guy who did the bios on the ECW website and the previous DVD releases.  Nice extra, but nothing to write home about...
2. Extreme Moments Montage:  Featuring a BLOWN spot by JT Smith, a New Jack suicide balcony dive, etc...
3. Promos:  by Steve Austin, a Brian Pillman and Pillman vs. Shane Douglas promo.
4. HIDDEN PROMO:  Continuing in the grand tradition of the previous DVD releases, Hardcore History features another hidden promo.  You can see the hidden profanity-laden but hilarious ECW blooper promo with ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas and Francine in Title 3.
Here's my rundown:
Best Matches:  Rey Jr. vs. Juvi, RVD vs. Sabu, Pitbulls vs. Raven/Richards, the end of ""High Incident"".
Cool Moment:  The Hidden promo, the blown spot in Extreme Moments Montage

1622804,5,B00005LOLJ,"ECW continues to show the world how they truely changed pro wrestling forever.  The cage match between the Gangstas and the Eliminators was a great, bloody bout for the tag titles, that featured several dives from the top of the cage.  The Raven & Stevie Richards vs the Pitbulls was a double dog collar match.  Buellah somehow talked the Pitbulls into making this match a two out of three falls which may not have been in the best interest of Stevie Richards as he lost alot of blood by the end.  The Shane Douglas vs Pitbull 2 was a classic match with a great angle.  This one also ends up bloody with Pitbull 2's face turning completely red.  The Cactus Jack vs Sandman bout was very entertaining.  The Sandman comes to the ring, as usual, with his ""Singapore Cane"" and Cactus Jack enters with his right forearm wrapped with barbed wire. This is definetly not a disappointing match.  But my favorite match on this DVD is most certainly the stretcher match between Rob Van Dam & Sabu.  This match contains alot of high flying, alot of good reversals, as well as many boken tables.  The DVD also has some other bonus material including an extreme moments montage.  This montage features JT Smith diving over the top rope, but his legs get caught up on his way over causing him to hit the concrete floor face first very hard.  You can see his head swelling before he can get back to his feet, which is pretty amazing because I didn't think he was getting back up.  The montage also shows a New Jack balcony dive that was basic New Jack. But the most gruesome part of the montage featured a huge (450 pound) wrestler that I'm not familiar with.  He jumps off the top rope landing on one leg, completely snapping his shin in two. You can accually hear and see his leg fold in half.  All in all this is a very good DVD, especially if you're a hardcore wrestling fan.",997488000,2,1863,4.422287390029325

7944110,3,B00005LOLJ,"Unlike the other ECW DVD's released by Pioneer Entertainment this title is not very good.  The action is not very crisp and honestly everything seems sloppy.  The Dreamer/Lee scaffold match is better suited as a highlight of the finish only.  Same thing goes for the Pitbulls putting Francine thru a table...the rest ofthe match was just a dud.  Rob Van Dam and Sabu have had some great matches, with Guilty As Charged 2000 being the best, yet here they give us a rather dull match...a stretcher match simply because it's a gimmick style match which is the theme of this disk.  The Sandman vs Foley match is pretty good, btu then these guysa re sloppy as hell, I know alot of people have this Foley lust and he comes across as the likeable underdog, but seriously he is rather terrible a wrestler.  He's had good matches as a human punching bag and stunt guy and his matches with Micheals and Sting were largely due to the other guy.  His match here is ok, but for this disk its one of the better matches.  Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Juventud Guerrera and Chris Benoit/Dean Malenko vs. Taz/Sabu are the only reason to buy this disk.  But two matches only gets you two stars.",1280448000,,1168,4.497630331753554

Tag Team Champions Sabu & Tazmanic vs. Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko - We get a confrontation between Benoit & Malenko with Public Enemy's Johnny Grunge & Rocco Rock in a wheelchair that turned physical with Rocco bleeding from his midsection before Tazmaniac & Sabu got involved starting the match with Malenko giving his team the edge as he kept dropping Sabu on his previously injured neck with vertical suplexes resulting in Taz to deliver his own onto both Malenko & Benoit causing both men to keep Sabu outside of the ring to focus on Taz's legs to the point where he was too injured to continue leaving Sabu alone with his daredevil offense with somersault & suicide dives multiple times onto both men in & out of the ring trying to divide & conquer before the numbers eventually caught up to him with an aftermath of all 3 teams having at each other.  The match itself was pretty much a glorified handicap match & really more about the result where both Benoit & Malenko, who was also the Television Champion & both members of the original Triple Threat with ECW Champion Shane Douglas, at their most successful in ECW.

Steel Cage/Weapons Match: Tag Team Champions Gangstas vs. Eliminators - This match was a normal steel cage match but had the additional twist of four executioners at ringside to hand in a weapon whenever one of the participants called for it & match had a more serious tone than any of the previous matches between both teams as Gangstas walked to the ring opposed to running to the ring but both teams started brawling outside of the cage into the crowding using whatever they could to beat on each other from the title belts to chair to the guardrail before making their way back around the ring with Saturn diving off the top of the cage onto everyone.  The fight continued in the ring with everyone at one point being tossed into the cage & bleeding with various weapons used including a fork, trash can, cookie sheet, and keyboard while Saturn kept going aerial off the cage with multiple dives before he was eventually caught one time resulting in a dangerous fall that had a really bad landing.  This was your typical Gangstas weaponsfest brawl with without a doubt the highlight reel being Saturn's multiple dives off the top of the cage along with the shock of who one of the executioners was unmasked to be.

2 Out Of 3 Falls/Dog Collar Match: Tag Team Champions Raven & Stevie Richards vs. Pitbulls - The stipulation here was that The Pitbulls must win the tag team titles or split up as Raven came out alone causing Pitbull #1 to drag Stevie from the back busted open while Pitbull #2 & Raven went at it working each other over with a hangman's choke over the top rope & piledriver through a table which busted Pitbull #2 open before the Pitbull's retaliated with Stevie Richards getting superbombed through another table.  Both teams brawled on the outside with weapons from a frying pan to a chair being used along with allies of both teams getting involved leading to such results as multiple superbombs from both teams including one with Raven's head bouncing off the side of the table, members of both teams going through tables in & outside of the ring, Beulah getting into a catfight with someone who had unfinished business with her, and Bill Alfonzo once again getting into it with Tod Gordon that caused him to make a decision that he ended up paying for.  This was your typical ECW hardcore match as you saw a bunch tables destroyed, weapons involved, high impact moves, and plenty of unexpected surprises.

Television Champion Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 - We get a special interview with Pitbull #1 with his head in a halo before the match in regards to his retirement due to the neck injury suffered by Douglas that caused the crowd to be completely outraged to the point where more security had to surround them coming to ringside like usual as the match started off with Pitbull #2 working over Douglas' neck with various impactful moves such as the brain buster, rude awakening, tombstone piledriver, DDT, and just wrenching & twisting his neck non-stop with the rabid crowd chanting to ""BREAK HIS NECK!"" as the match spilled over to the floor where each man was on the receiving end of a chairshot along with hit with other random objects such as a baked pie & a fan's crutch with the fight spilling into the front row & back ringside where Douglas kept taunting Pitbull #1 with a chair while Pitbull #2 went for a top rope dive resulting in a crash & burn that busted him open allowing Douglas to focus on his head using every single weapon & dirty tactic he could to keep him down to no avail while Pitbull #2 just kept coming back with power moves but showed heavy effects of blood loss.  Out of their feud that lasted close to a year for this title, this was my favorite match involving the two from their action in the ring to the crowd being so hated towards Shane & Francine adding to the match.

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Juventud Guerrera - Rey started out early going for a submission with a move straight out of Great Muta's playbook with a combination of a leg scissors & facelock while performing his high risk offense such as a slingshot moonsault onto Juvi on the outside while Juvi went for more high impact moves such as a brainbuster & a springboard somersault kick that hit Rey right in the mouth. They got more creative as Rey did a frankensteiner off the top rope onto Juvi who was on the apron to the floor & using the referee as a springboard for a somersault dive onto the outside. It was during the final fall where both men really took it to the ""extreme"" with both executing springboard moonsaults into the crowd & one man catching the other coming off the top rope into a powerbomb before the fight went outside where the famous scene happened with Mysterio doing the frankensteiner off the hood of a car. This was probably each man's most famous match in ECW as this had the best case of lucha libre mixed with the ""hardcore"" ECW environment & say tune after the match as the hardcore action wasn't over.

Scaffold Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee - The rules for a scaffold match are that the first man to throw his opponent off the scaffold to the floor wins but this match had a special twist in that the ring was filled with tables for the loser to fall through on the way down.  This started off with a bang with Dreamer bouncing a trash can off Lee's head & putting it through the wall as both men brawled throughout the crowd using whatever they could such as the candy machine, beer cooler, chairs & tables while taking some hard hits like being dropped crotch first on the guardrail & a powerslam on the concrete before both men eventually made their way to the scaffold where they were still beating the hell out of each other with either a DDT or choking with the electrical wiring.  Normally scaffold matches are very limited with both opponents not having much room on it to fight while the crowd is really just waiting for someone to fall off but that wasn't the case here as a majority of the match was fought throughout the entire arena before making their way to the top making this standout above other scaffold matches.

ECW Champion Sandman vs. Cactus Jack - Cactus Jack had his entire forearm & hand wrapped in barbed wire while Sandman had a singapore cane in his hand & Woman with an extra cane at ringside as Sandman started out with cane shots to Cactus' head & even going aerial leaping over the top rope to deliver a cane shot but Cactus was able to recover with a single arm DDT along with using the cane himself & delivering a chairshot.  Sandman was able to use Cactus' barbed wire against him by blocking a barbed wire punch with a chair & caning that arm then turned his focus to his head with a DDT & piledriver on a chair causing Cactus to bleed while also trying to fight fire with fire using barbed wire himself but Cactus Jack made a comeback using a chair for his trademark elbow off the apron, second rope legdrop with Sandman's face covered with a chair, and punches with the barbed wire hand until Sandman was bleeding but the biggest impact would come from someone who had a personal agenda against both men.  I'll be honest in that I didn't like the Sandman/Cactus Jack series of matches as they came off as sloppy brawls but this was their best encounter from that series but stay tuned as someone gets one of the most memorable exits in ECW history

Stretcher Match: Sabu vs. Rob Van Dam - These men have been feuding over respect throughout the summer with their previous match resulting in both men being taken out on a stretcher resulting in this match where the only way to win is for one man to be taken to the back on a stretcher.  Both men started out targeting each other's knee missing leg sweeps & connecting with dropkicks to the knee before Sabu was able to get the advantage with a brief leg drop & his daredevil offense of the slingshot leg lariat & headbutt along with RVD attempting a slingshot splash only for Sabu to counter with a dropkick & slingshot senton to the outside but RVD was able to regain the advantage with his educated feet such as a legdrop across the guardrail, spin kicking a crotched Sabu off the ropes to the floor, and top rope legdrop onto Sabu's face covered by a chair.  Both men continued to trade momentum with Sabu delivering punishment like a top rope legdrop that sandwitched RVD's between his leg & an open chair, two versions of the facebuster, and offensive moves onto the stretcher while RVD dished out as much as he took with the Van Daminator, moonsault off the guardrail, and a fisherman's buster off the apron through a table.  The entire RVD vs. Sabu series was extremely physical from start to finish & this match was no exception with the stretcher coming into play as a weapon of it's own.

DVD extras include a promos by Steve Austin & Brian Pillman, a confrontation between Pillman & Shane Douglas, a montage of Extreme Moments, and a hidden extra of an interview blooper with Douglas & Francine.

This set more than any of the others cater more to the ""extreme"" stereotype of ECW in terms of blood & use of weapons so I highly recommend this set.",1148688000,6,10629,4.524479166666667
7944112,5,B00005LOLJ,"I recently got in ECW, and im very impressed with the matches. I always loved WWE, and when I heard about ECW, it was like porn. You rarely saw it, and when you did-it was a real treat. When they folded, I guess I didn't care at the time. Now that I got in WWE hardcore, I purchased as much ECW dvds as I could. This dvd has some excellent matches, and I recommend it to anyone who loves wrestling.",1109635200,,398,3.9875
7944113,5,B00005LOLJ,"All around, a really great DVD, and that is rare, considering all of the bad DVD releases wrestling-wise. Brutal hardcore wrestling, great high flying action... it has everything ECW was about, and everything that the WWE lacks today. Buy the DVD version, as it has a great promo from Steve Austin before he became the badass Stone Cold character, along with wrestler profiles for those not so familar with the now defunct ECW.

Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko vs. Sabu & Taz (***1/2): Alright match, probably put on the DVD just to show how these guys got a start in ECW back in 1995, and how it launched their American careers.

The Gangstas vs. The Eliminators (*****): A brutal, brutal cage match with blood from everybody, especially John Kronus, who bleeds like a pizza. Perry Saturn (pre-WCW/WWE fame) takes about 10 dives off the cage, all of which are very cool. Not many wrestling holds are executed, but this one is fun to watch, for sure.

Raven & Stevie Richards vs. The Pitbulls (***): Okay match, the most memorable thing being the amount of tables used by the Pitbulls. Like most early ECW, it's all brawl and table, which is okay.

Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull 2 (*): Worst match on the DVD, just because it wasn't up to par with the rest of the stuff. Okay if you're a Douglas or Pitbull fan though, I guess.

Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman (**1/2): A great brawl, but nothing too spectacular. It's more of a crowd reaction thing than it is a good match, but these two ECW icons are great fighters and can put on a show, kinda.

Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu (****): One of the best matches on the DVD in my opinion. It's known as the 'Stretcher Match', where you have to get your opponent on a stretcher and wheel him out. Sounds stupid, but the concept really is great. RVD wasn't that big when the match occured, but he impresses everybody with high spots and great brawling as well as wrestling. Sabu blows a bunch of spots as usual, but makes up for it with crazy moonsaults and eventually the big dive onto the stretcher for the win. Very cool match, but loses a star for blown spots.

Rey Misterio Jr. vs. Juventud Guerrera (*****): This is a great example of how ECW brought lucha libre into the US. Mexican-style wrestling in this 2 out of 3 falls match, these guys are both about 170 pounds and they fly like ragdolls. Amazing, amazing in ring action.

Tommy Dreamer vs. Prime Time Brian Lee (*****): HIGH INCIDENT! Yeah, these guys brawl all over the ECW Arena before going up to the scaffold and fighting up there for about 5 minutes. After a few slugfests, Dreamer knocks Lee off the scaffold and into the ring through a ring stacked full of tables! Worth 5 stars just for that, one of the greatest high spots you'll see, ECW or elsewhere.

Buy this DVD now! The price is well worth it, whether you're an ECW fan, a fan of brawling-style wrestling, or just a casual wrestling fan, you'll probably enjoy something, cause this early years ECW DVD has it all.",1094515200,4,2968,4.49165120593692
7944114,5,B00005LOLJ,"ECW always puts out great DVD's so let's see what we got here:
1. Sabu/Taz Vs. Chris Benoit/Dean Malenko - Really great match but short, especially when one of them leaves with an injury. What's here is great though! ****
2. The Gansters Vs. The Eliminators - Cage match - Not the greatest match, but with the Gansters you'd know they'd be blood everywhere. They beat on each other with various objects like they were in a video game or somethin :-).. Saturn Flies off the top of cage like 5 times giving this an extra star. *1/2
3. Raven/Steven Richards Vs. The Pitbulls - 2/3 Fall Double-Collar match - The stipulation is that each person is attached to an opponent with a collar wrapped around their head. Sounds stupid, but they really pulled it off. Violence and tables .. TO THE EXTREME!.. Really great match with a really great ending and Tommy Dreamer and 911 getting involved at the end. *****
4. Shane Douglas Vs. Pitbull #2 - Pitbull #1 was injured by Douglas and his partner vows revenge! This series always seemed
boring to me and unfortunatly so did this. *1/2
5. The Sandman Vs. Cactus Jack - Barbed-Wire match - Cactus gets his chance at the ECW Championship belt. Some crazy spots in this match from both wrestlers made this a surpring good barbed-wire match. ****
6. Sabu Vs. RVD - Stretcher match - The first person to be carried out on a stretcher loses. Crazy, Insane, Career-Ending Spots in this one. Sloppy match, but the insane moves these men attempt make this my favorite match of the DVD. *****
7. Rey Mysterio Jr. Vs. Juventud Guerrera - 2/3 Falls match - Ridiculously non-stop lucha match with both men flying around inside and outside the ring.. Even outside the arena! Awesome match *****
8. Tommy Dreamer Vs. Brian Lee - Scaffold match - A Scaffold match is where 2 wrestlers battle on a cakewalk 15ft or so over the ring, first one thrown off loses. This one has a 1,000 tables or so under the scaffold for someone break on the way down. For a scaffold match (which always suck) this isn't too bad - **1/2
