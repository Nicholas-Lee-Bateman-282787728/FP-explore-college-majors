7775710,3,B01H2OZEDY,"Once a major KISS freak. The problem with today's version of KISS is that they are just kind of boring.
That's no fault of Thayer and Singer as they are much better musicians than Frehley and Criss.
Simmons and especially Stanley are just fattter bloated versions of their formal rock messiah selves.
Good workout Bluray, but if I hear Rock and Roll All Night once more I'll probably shoot myself.

Storing this album in my CD collection is a problem and all my LP's are in storage.  Real world problems, I guess.

7775728,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Five stars simply because KISS Rocks Vegas captures KISS' live sound more accurately than any previous official release. It's big, heavy, & raw...and, of course, bombastic. Unlike KISS' other official live releases, KISS Rocks Vegas doesn't sound over-produced...it sounds natural, and that's a good thing. Yes, Paul's voice is shaky...I've definitely heard him sound better, but I've also heard him sound worse. There are some mistakes, but that's live music...it's nice that KISS have actually released a live album without doing much -- if any -- polishing & overdubbing in the studio. The setlist is solid and leans fairly heavily on the classics. For two reasons, however, I wouldn't mind if KISS had sacrificed a few songs in this set for another song or two from Monster (Hell or Hallelujah is included) and a few tunes from Sonic Boom. First, most of the tunes here have already been released on other live albums; second, I'm a fan of every era of KISS, so I'd like to have more live versions of songs originally recorded by the current lineup, as well as some other songs from the KISS catalog that have never made it onto a live album. Having said that...in making its first appearance on a live album, the semi-ballad Tears Are Falling briefly slows the momentum of this otherwise rocking set...a much stronger choice from the Asylum album would have been UH! All Night. Now for a pet peeve of mine: Deuce is not a mid-set song...the relentless, pounding nature of Deuce makes it a great show-starter, but it doesn't fit well after the first few songs...so, I prefer to hear Deuce first or second, or not at all. Ultimately, though, my setlist preferences are minor. I'll gladly take whichever songs KISS choose to deliver and however they choose to deliver them. If nothing else, finally having a live version of War Machine makes this set worth owning. And say what you want about Eric & Tommy wearing the classic makeup, but they have KISS clicking on all cylinders. Although I have focused primarily on the CD, the Blu-ray is very good, too. That's no surprise, as KISS is the ultimate visual rock band, and they deliver in a big way. Overall, this is a very strong release.",1481932800,3,2190,4.781002638522428

The sound quality is very good and the extra cd is a good bonus.  The cd's and such actually fit into the book!  So this will look nice on your shelf.  Is it worth owning? YES , for a kiss fan and mostly yes if you just want a collectible item.  There's lots of pictures in this book too. IT's well worth owning and I am glad I got it.  However if you just want the blu ray and one cd , then get the much cheaper non book version.  YOU won't get the second cd though.",1480550400,2,602,3.7983870967741935

7775791,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Don't listen to that other review.  Eric Singer is longer tenured than Ace or Peter Criss.  Is ACDC a cover band now?  Was VH a cover band?  No.  This is KISS.  Gene and Paul, and as I said, Eric Singer who's been in the band longer than anyone other than those two.  Plus, Ace quit. So what's the problem?  Paul and Gene are supposed to stop because Ace left again?  Gimme a break.  Peter Criss can't play anymore (wasn't great in the first place).  So stop w the cover band talk because you are clueless.

The music here is well produced. Paul can't sing like he used to, but he still sounds good.  He's not hanging on.  He still delivers as evidenced by this CD.  Dug deep in the catalog to please fans of any era of KISS.  70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s....  It's all represented on this record.

So.. If you have wanted another KISS live album with guys who can actually still play the music, pick this up. its good.  Or go play the old kiss if you don't like the current band. But don't take the time out of your day just to leave a bad review because you don't approve of who's in the band.  Childish.  Don't you have better things to do?

I do too.  One of those things is watching the DVD again tonight.  Because it's awesome.",1474502400,3,1225,4.181034482758621

Truth is the drug and alcohol addictions of Ace and Peter were a big contributor to the demise of the original lineup. Their choice and it had consequences. Paul and Gene started Kiss and they have every right to carry on as they see fit. Kiss is still a great live band. One of the best. Tommy and Eric are great players and Kiss has never sounded better. Sure Tommy is playing Ace's licks but he plays them to their original perfection. I don't want it any other way. Eric is without a doubt a superior drummer to Peter. Peter had done nothing outside of Kiss and watching him play on Kissology 3 is painful. He had no business doing drum solos. Paul may not be the singer he once was but still delivers and so does Gene.

I highly recommend this packaging for Kiss Rocks Vegas. It is very well packaged. The book has great photos and the music and video is outstanding. Two CDs and two DVDs and a great book. Well worth the cost. Kiss knows how to give their fans great products.",1474502400,7,1306,4.266129032258065
7775793,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Bout time they released a blu ray!  Great picture quality and sound.  Includes a nice small booklet.  Nice to have the backstage acoustic included as well.  A longer show with a drum solo and a few more rare songs would have been extra nice but they probably had a time restriction on the show.  Im glad they are still doing it after all these years.  Its always fun and Its great to see another performance.  These guys work hard!  Long live KISS in all of their versions and members, past and present.",1474416000,3,503,4.391304347826087

We have tribute Tommy as Fake Ace but at least Eric Singer, who is a real rock drummer (Alice Cooper, etc.), as Fake Catman. They wear their old 70s outfits & makeup just like the tribute bands do so why pay a dime more than you'd pay to see a tribute act? At least they do play songs from all eras & not just the 70s makeup years but if I never hear Deuce again it will be too soon.

7775812,4,B01H2OZEDY,"Finally, KISS on Bluray! Is it worth getting? Yeah but there's a couple of things that irk me about it. Lets do a list!

The good
The acoustic set sounds amazing!
Some goodies but oldies being played in the main set
Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer are on point!
Vocals from Paul don't sound atrocious, more on that later

The bad
Overdubs! Mostly on Paul's side. We all know he can't pull off the stuff he could before so it makes sense.
Editing! As a drummer, I'm always watching Eric and hearing one thing and seeing another is annoying. This show was shot over 9 dates, I think, so a little more attention to the editing would have been nice.
Sound! Leaves a lot to be desired. Drums sound too distant, Gene's bass tone is not as tight and Paul's guitar gets buried in all that mess too much.

The ugly
1080i images!? Spend a little more money and make it true 1080p, Gene. (For those who don't know, there's a difference between an Interlaced scan and a Progressive scan, if you have a big TV, 60 inch leather heels here, you might be able to tell the difference.)

All in all, I'm happy with the purchase. Its just sad that the acoustic set sounds miles better than the Vegas show.",1473379200,2,1183,4.339366515837104
7775813,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Before the release and looking at the set list, I wasn't expecting much of it. Its basically the same old set list, nothing surprising.
Ive been a fan since 1979, appreciates all line-up. Ive no issue with Eric and Tommy wearing the Catman and Spaceman makeup.

But this concert blows me away. The visuals and the audio mix is excellent. Ive watch this everyday since I got it 10 days ago.

If you're not a fan, buy it and includes it in your collection.

I love the surround sound. If you call yourself a KISS fan you will for sure want this in your KISS LIBRARY. The DVD is 1 hour and 30 minutes of amazing audio and video work. YOU WANTED THE BEST.........THEY ARE RIGHT HERE PERFORMING. Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer just blow Ace and Peter away. I've been a fan from the beginning. Ace and Peter have screwed over Gene and Paul so many times. I have the utmost respect for Gene and Paul to keep trying to help the 2 losers(Ace and Peter). It is just my opinion so all of you who still like Ace and Peter PLEASE DON'T LET ME OFFEND YOU.......I DON'T MEAN TO.,1473206400,8,776,4.321917808219178
7775817,3,B01H2OZEDY,"I have been a kiss fan since 1977 and I have to say that it seriously looks like it's really time for them to hang up the platform boots and take off the makeup.  Paul can barely sing anymore and the rest of the band is just going through the motions on all the standard hits on the DVD.  Most of the band sounds really slow and tired on stage.  That's not to say that all of the performances are bad on the DVD, there are some highlights - especially the ones that feature Gene.  Down and dirty Songs like WAR MACHINE and PARASITE still sound super grungy and rough. Even Gene's blood spitting portion of the show (in which he is seated on his God of Thunder throne) is still really effective and gets under your skin. The best part of of this set though is the acoustic portion of the disc. The band plays gems like GOIN BLIND, COMIN' HOME, LOVE HER ALL I CAN and others that truely show how great those songs are.  Overall, it's clear to me that Kiss's ongoing touring and performing should stop. The band is really starting to show its age and will eventually outstay it's welcome if Gene and Paul keep continuing on with this tribute show. I would be ok with one FINAL tour with all original members, but we all know that will probably never happen.",1473206400,3,1254,4.274261603375527

7775824,4,B01H2OZEDY,"This is not Kiss' best effort to date, but still worth the purchase. If you want to see KISS live, NOW is the time to do it, as I fear their touring days are numbered.
My first impression was that KISS fans are still showing more skin than ever...but now it's on their heads. LOL
Paul's voice has seen better days, and he really struggles on a couple songs, but does well on others considering his age...now if he'd spend the extra $$ to get a decent looking wig...the one he's wearing here is quite bad.  Gene's looking a little bloated, but amazingly, still sounds great, and does justice to the ""demon"" image he created decades ago.  Not bad for a dude, what? In his 80's ? (joking)
Eric and Tommy shine in this show.  I sincerely doubt a KISS show would be half as good these days with the original knuckleheads....sorry, but it's true.  Not the best KISS show I've seen, but not the worst either...it's a fun watch.
I don't want to come off sounding like the show was bad in any way...it's just not KISS at their peak.  Like I said, if you want to see them live, now is the time to do it...before they call it ""quits"" or worse...become a parody of what they were.
I'd encourage anyone to add Hard Rock's venue (The Joint) to their watch list for concerts of any kind.  It's small (4000 seats), has great sound, and being so small, really has no ""bad"" seats. Concerts there are usually cheaper there than other venues, and you get ""Vegas"" with your trip!  One of my favorite places to see concerts.
I purchased the Blu-ray 2 disc set...and don't really think and extra cd and picture book is worth the $60 extra, but if you do....enjoy!",1472688000,2,1640,4.375
7775825,5,B01H2OZEDY,"I loved this!  I've read all the band's memoirs and listened to Peter and Ace's post KISS music.  Ace is still good, and Peter isn't.  I can't help but think if Ace hadn't gotten into the alcohol and drugs so badly, he'd still be with KISS, but Peter?  I dunno.  Let's face it, Eric is a much better drummer than Peter was and he sings well (sorry Peter fans, but Eric sings Black Diamond and Beth better than Peter did especially toward the end of his stint with KISS).  That's just my humble opinion.

As for this DVD, it made me wish I could have been there.  The picture quality and sound are superb.  As in just about every concert video I have, I wish the camera would quit jumping around so much, but it's much less annoying here than in some of my other concert DVDs.  As for the choice of songs, I was very happy to see Psycho Circus which I love, but no Strutter?  Otherwise I have no complaints.  As I was watching this, I thought back to Geddy Lee's remarks about touring with KISS; ""Say what you will about KISS, but I have never seen a band so determined to give the fans a spectacular show"".

7775841,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Its complicated.
Part 1
My first KISS experience was in 1977 at the Los Angeles Forum for the recording of ALIVE II. So you can see I go way back with the band. At that time in history, KISS was larger than life with the makeup and mystic. Once that was unveiled, that part of it was lost forever. I moved on and loved the other incarnations of the band and finally accepted Eric and Bruce as KISS as it was back in 1995. Then the Reunion happen in 96, which was great to see the original band back together, but I loved Revenge and Carnival of Souls. It showed me what that line-up was capable of musically and it was relevant for the time period. However, Gene and Paul steer the ship, as they always have, and made decisions that they believe are best for the entity we call KISS.
To that end, I respect and have been a fan of the group with and without makeup. And I get the fact that most people, whether they are really fans or not, want to see KISS with the makeup and the show because that is what the real spectacle is. Gene and Paul state that people want to see the original characters. Ok. I get that. Personally, I believe characters emulate the actions of beings, and its not simply applying makeup and costumes. I didn't think Tommy Thayer made a good Space Ace when he was in the Cold Gin tribute band, and I don't think he makes a great one now. Ive always like Eric Singers drumming and the fact that he plays the original songs at the proper tempo  As I once told him, he made KISS feel heavy again. Similar to Thayer, I don't feel Im watching the Catman when I see him in makeup. Those characters will always belong to Ace and Peter whether Ace or Peter have makeup on or not. Its who they are.
Part 2
I had my reservations about purchasing this video as I have witnessed many youtube clips and have resigned my opinion that Pauls voice is not what it used to be (God bless him) and that maybe they should just call it a day. However, I support their decision to carry on because they are living legends and there is demand for their product. And after all, maybe people should just lighten up and enjoy it for what it is  having a good time.
 So my video review is this: short, simple and sweet. It is great. It by far, the best non-original member video they have released. The set list is awesome  the venue perfect: the music tight. Pauls vocals may have been retouched in the studio (if they were, Im ok with that. Why discard an otherwise great performance) because they really sound acceptable. Gene is a machine that just won't quit; his playing and vocals are still good. Tommy and Eric are true professionals and make this video solid and powerful.
So if you can keep feelings about the band members past/present to the side and just focus on the video itself, there is no reason to not buy this  It is as good as it gets. Highly recommended to fans and non-fans alike for its pure entertainment value",1472256000,36,2931,4.283393501805054

7775844,5,B01H2OZEDY,Got my Deluxe Edition yesterday! It's great packaging as a book with 2 discs in the inside front cover and the 2 CD's in the inside back cover.  It looks like a coffee table book. Wish they had used some more unseen photos but it still ROCKS! This is a very nice addition for any KISS fan. It would have been cool to include a casino chip or something as well as an added bonus. But I am very pleased.,1472256000,9,401,4.0125
7775845,3,B01H2OZEDY,"First off,i would like to say that i have been a fan for more than 40 yrs and the original line up was my KISS so the whole make up thing is a point of contention with me,but i promised myself to be unbiased while viewing this.

THE GOOD: The picture quality is great! For those of you who are watching this on DVD because you haven't converted to BD yet,do yourself a favor and get a player as i feel you will be missing out on the best experience. The sound quality is also great! Just listening on my Vizio sound bar sounded really good,so i'm sure that if you have a big surround sound system it will take the roof off!

The packaging is very nicely done with lots of really good photos.

The performances by the guys are a lot better than i anticipated. There were some audio touch ups im sure as Paul dosen't sound bad here at all. Nowhere near his prime,but he sounded and performed really well. One of the most underrated front men in rock! Gene does a great job also. He's not the demon character that he once was and hes pretty much regulated to his area of the stage but he still is an imposing figure. His bass playing and vocals are top notch here. Erics drumming is spot on as is Tommy's guitar playing. He does a nice job here of capturing the songs as they were originally played. And i really like his white Les Paul!

The stage and lighting was impressive also!

THE BAD: Quick cut editing! Not as bad as some concert BD's i have seen but i still would like for this to stop! Sheesh! Back and forth,back and forth,every 3-4 sec. But thankfully it didn't distract from my enjoyment to bad. I have viewed a lot worse and thankfully no split screen crap!

The setlist: To much predictabilty,but adding COTN, Parasite & TAF was cool!

THE UGLY: Well,besides Eric & Tommy in the makeup it would have to be Pauls wig!! My goodness it can be distracting! Can't he afford a better one? By the end of the show it makes him look like an amusement park mascot! The kid in the audience dressed as Gene had a better wig! And why does Eric even need one? So that he can resemble Peter more i imagine,even though lots of people will claim that's not what hes doing. And i didn't notice before,but when Gene does his blood spitting routine he suddenly looks as huge as Brock Lesnar! What up with that?! And he could have drooled a little more blood. It's more like he's mimicing the '75-early '76 era where it casually runs down his chin. I prefer the '77-'83 era where it went all over the place.

BONUS FEATURE: The acoustic show was okay. Thankfully it didn't last longer than it did. Just as it was starting to drag it was over,but everyone performed fine. Gene was the highlight. Tommy seemed bored. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the little girl who requested SIOL but got a song about Genes dick instead. I mean,if your not going to play what the fans request then why do you ask Paul?! And of course there's the usual dig at Peter from Paul before ""Beth"" which Eric does a fine job with. Paul mentions that Eric gives it the respect it deserves which i guess is a lot more than what he gave it by mocking Peter in the studio while he was recording it.

It was a fun show to rock out to! Plus you also get the cd. I don't know how much replay value it will get from me,but it was $19.99 well spent. I would recommend it!",1472169600,10,3333,4.2362204724409445
7775846,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Great DVD.  For those of you that complain about not being the original members, just stop.  This version of the band is great.  I have seen KISS live with ACE, Bruce and Tommy and with that Peter and Eric, and this is one of the tightest versions musically they have ever had.  Their new music is good, and this DVD/CD version rocks.  Sure there are some edit issues, where in the same song, Paul switches between his Firebird signatures and his Iceman signatures, but who cares.  Tommy  isn't ACE and with that being said, he isn't sloppy playing live.  Don't get me wrong, I love what Ace did for the band, but Tommy is just plain a better guitar player and Eric a better drummer.  What I care about is the music.  Hell I still like VH's 5150, great album, just not a DLR album, but rocks with Sammy.  A good group is a good group.",1472169600,6,834,4.282051282051282

They should do at least 2 to 4 more songs.  The acoustic part only gets a stereo mix.  Other than those couple complaints is worth it for the 19.99 price tag plus you get a cd of the main feature.,1472169600,4,354,3.9295774647887325

7775850,4,B01H2OZEDY,"In November of 2014 KISS did one of the very few things they hadn't tried up to this point: a Vegas residency. After all many hard rock artists have tried their hand at Vegas successfully so over the years; Both Guns N'Roses and Motley Crue twice, Def Leppard and more recently, Scorpions and Billy Idol. Las Vegas, Nevada is no longer the place where acts go to die, the stigma has faded with time. It seemed obvious KISS would roll the dice in Sin City eventually.

Vegas would force KISS to play shows on a smaller scale than the band is accustomed to resulting a slightly more personal performance. That is not to say KISS toned down the fanfare. The antics like pyrotechnics and fire-breathing are still therethey're just a little less elaborate. While Rocks Vegas is not a particularly fresh concept, it sure is good to see some new live KISS content in an albeit unique setting.

KISS Rocks Vegas initially saw selected showings in movie theatres on May 25th before its impending home video release. KISS looks spectacular on the big screen but watching the Blu-Ray/DVD at home is the next best thing. The last official stand-alone KISS live concert DVD come over ten years ago Rock the Nation back in 2005 and featured the same lineup.

The accompanying CD also marks the first official live album KISS had issued under this current lineup (unless you count the Instant Live CDs). Is it necessary for a band like KISS to put out a live album in what is likely the twilight of their career? For one thing it would shock many to know at just how few live albums KISS has in comparison to bands like Rush and Iron Maiden. If anything I'm surprised we haven't had more live KISS. Documenting live performances becomes important as a band ages.

Its latter-day KISS, a lineup that features Tommy Thayer on guitar and Eric Singer on drums alongside Gene and Paul. That means no Ace and Peter, a fact that should be well outlined by now. This lineup, although quite capable, has its hit-and-miss moments a fact that becomes more evident when listening to the CD. Let's be honest for a minute: Paul's voice is shaky, Gene forgets lyrics and Tommy's solos are sloppy on ocasion. They may no longer be in their prime, yet KISS is still more than capable of putting on an incredible and visually compelling show.

KISS doesn't stray too far from its usual setlist of classics like Love Gun and Detroit Rock City, but nevertheless the band took a chance and added Tears Are Falling to the set and chose to play no less than three songs from fan-favourite Creatures of the Night. The inclusions of Parasite and War Machine are worth mentioning as is Hell or Hallelujah from the latest studio effort, Monster.

As an added treat, Rocks Vegas features a 7 song acoustic setlist. Paul Stanley shaking his head after filling in for Gene's forgotten lyrics during Christine Sixteen is simply priceless. Seeing a relaxed KISS as people with no makeup, pyro or costume playing as Love Her All I Can and Goin' Blind is a great experience. I think it really says something about KISS that the band is this effective in an acoustic setting. I initially was apprehensive at Eric Singer doing Beth, a song that was always Peter Criss' baby, but its the definitive highlight of the session.

It's a monumental task to substitute the live concert experience for a DVD or CD. Rocks Vegas doesn't quite achieve that feat, but it displays a determined KISS giving a crowd-pleasing performance. The Blu-Ray version is crisp and looks great on my HD TV and the live CD kept those imperfections and mistakes giving a real live feel and that's a good thing.

Now bring back I Stole Your Love, pretty please.

7775861,1,B01H2OZEDY,"I understand people wanting KISS to continue.  I really do.  Myself, I see the clones and I get sick.  I supported 1975-2002.  Just can't stomach this lineup dressing up like the originals.  Also don't find Thayer very interesting. Purchased Black N Blue back in the day when Gene reommended them, was heartily unimpressed.  Dressing him up like Ace didn't help things.  If they do a final tour with originals, I will go.  It may still not sound as good as it was due to Pauls voice deteriorqting or Peter's possible ability to bring it, but Ace3 still brings it, as does Gene and Paul part way.  Sorry, this set is not for me.",1472169600,3,627,4.477876106194691
7775862,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Ok here's the deal...  I've been following KISS like a religion since 1977.  I have seen every incarnation of the band live from 1979 to present.  My review is for the deluxe version that I just received from Amazon.  Let's get one thing out of the way first...  If any true KISS fans are reading this then they should understand that I respect their opinion about the whole Ace and Peter ""not being there anymore""! I get it, and believe it or not, so do KISS...  Peter is going to be 71 this December, Ace may be rejoining the band soon, and that would be great!  If Ace doesn't rejoin, that's okay too.
The last time I saw KISS live was the last show of the 40th anniversary tour in late August of 2014.  The same year that this film was shot.  They are still cranking out great show, after great show!  Anyone who loves KISS should be grateful that they are still around!

Now, does Paul Stanley sound like a parakeet with his in between song banter?  YES!
Has Paul Stanley aged well?  YES and NO!  Physically, I think he could catch a punt return and run it back against (insert favorite team here).  Voice wise, after surgeries and 40 years of doing this, Father Time has crept up on Paul.  In his defense, he still can bring it and is one of the best frontmen of rock out there.  Gene, is well, Gene.  His voice sounds great although he never was much of a singer like Stanley, but he's older now and none of them move around like they used to.  Just keep reminding yourself that Gene and Paul are now into their sixties and are still in wonderful shape!

As for the deluxe version of the show...  Nice packaging with a heavy hardcover 60 page book chocked full of great pics from the performance!  The DVD, bluray, and CDs all fit inside the front and rear cover respectfully.
  The video is superb and almost looks 3D at times (which I'm surprised KISS didn't release a 3D version along with a scratch and sniff set, knowing how they like marketing stuff)!
You have a few options on the audio that you can choose from... Pcm... Dolby... And DTS...  I personally ran it with DTS and the sound was bombastic!  No hype!  My walls were shaking and every time a flashpot went off, it knocked a snot bubble out of my nose!

For the ones that have seen KISS recently, they've modified the stage to lose the gigantic spider light truss and they actually created a visually thrilling experience for the Joint.  I enjoyed the gigantic video screens and KISS' entrance to the stage.
The set list was good, although some gems were missing, like Cold Gin, but KISS pulled songs from every era from the 70's to present. Personally, they could have dropped Hell or hallelujah for, well, heck, Cold Gin!  But at the end of the day or bluray, you still sit there with a smile on your face because you just witnessed a band that has been around for along long time, still put on a show that rivals, if not surpasses the likes of Iron Maiden or the just wrapped up, Guns n Roses tour.  And this thing was shot about two years ago.

So even if you hate Tommy and Eric, but still listen to KISS on your way to work or home, get your hands on the delux version or the regular if the deluxe is too much.  I love the deluxe for the book!  If you catch a live KISS show and buy a tourbook you spend 40 bucks for the book.  Double that price and you not only get a beautiful hardcover book, but also, the bluray, DVD, and two CDs.  Well worth the investment! You will not be dissapointed!  I promise!",1472169600,97,3482,4.293394777265745

7775866,5,B01H2OZEDY,"This is truly the greatest rock and roll spectacle in the history of rock music. I don't get all the crying and whining about original members. Kiss is and always will be Paul and Gene. Not knock to anyone else in the band past or present,but it's a fact. Kiss outgrew Ace and Peter in the 80's and to be honest those guys were not even good enough musicians to be able to cover KISS 80's to 90's periods. Not trying to bash just give facts. The absolute most simplelest ones like love it loud or lick it up and heavens on fire. This line up not only plays the 80's and 90's catalog,they also play all the 70's classics the way they sounded from alive and the original recordings. I enjoy ALL eras of Kiss and I am grateful they are still around releasing music and touring. I will be picking up the deluxe version of Kiss rocks Vegas and cannot wait to view on my big screen and surround system in my home!",1472083200,23,907,4.188571428571429
7775867,5,B01H2OZEDY,"Saw 2 of these Vegas shows, they sounded better than ever. I've seen KISS 75 times, in every lineup since the 70's, and I don't get the ridiculous comments about tribute band and all that junk. What 40 plus year old band has the same line up, and this line up has been KISS longer than any other.  Plus, they sound better than ever, and is that most t what this is about? Can't wait to get this and relive those shows!",1471737600,42,418,4.097560975609756

7775869,5,B01H2OZEDY,"For all the other comments that say it is the same thing and it's not the real KISS. Why write a comment on something that is a pre-order and you don't own. 2nd if you don't like the current line up then do as your mother should have taught you if you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything at all. KISS is the best life show in 4 decades and no other entertainer can come close. There show is total different then what was in the 70's because lights, pyro and everything else is improved due to newer safer and better show. There my peace has been said and if you want the best you have to pay a little more sometimes.",1471305600,24,629,4.04
