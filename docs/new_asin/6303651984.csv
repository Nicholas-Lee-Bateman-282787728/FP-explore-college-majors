700865,5,6303651984,"I've only seen a short clip of her topless, but her breasts are fantastic. They are perfectly shaped, probably a healthy C-cup. If she was like that in the whole film I would buy it and never leave the house again. I just can't get enough of them.",1006819200,17,247,4.166666666666667
700866,3,6303651984,"If, as a teenager, you sat through countless John Hughes films hoping that this would be the movie that would find Molly Ringwald going topless, this is the film for you!  Sorry for being sexist, but the sight of Molly Ringwald's breasts are pretty much all this film promises.  The plot -- a Fatal Attraction rip-off -- is obvious, the ending predictable, and the acting is pretty much second-rate except for Ringwald who reveals a zest for over-the-top villiany and, in her earlier scenes, actually does manage to bring some sympathy to her spurned woman.  Still, the film is mostly a tease that lures its male viewers along with the promise of showing us what we were fantasizing about during the Breakfast Club.  It must be said that when they finally do make their debut, Molly's breasts are not a disappointment -- even if the rest of the film is.  Still, its hard to get over the fact that this is the quissential '80s teenager -- the star of 16 Candles, the girl who helped make ""Are you a virgin, Clare?"" a pop cultural catch phrase -- wandering around topless and engaging in soft-core sex.  Its one of those weird, pop moments that pretty much distances the viewer from the film (so much as it is).  But that curiosity valure pretty much gives the movie whatever worth it might have.  Brat Pack indeed! (Yeah, I know that last comment doesn't make any sense but how could anyone review this film without a pointless Brat Pack comment?)",1002672000,52,1446,4.62109375
700867,4,6303651984,"This is the same Molly that we loved in '16 Candles' and 'The Breakfast Club', but WOW!!! She sure grew up to be a sexy babe! Molly plays an insanely jealous and dominating female that you can actually sympathize with. Heck Molly even has a topless sex scene in this one!
The story is on the darker side and is a little disturbing. It's the only one I know of where the stalker is a female. I'd like to see more movies like this where the 'weirdo' roles are played by females.
Despite other reviews, I say that this is a great flick. Molly has added a deeper range of characters that can be put on her resume.",991785600,12,609,4.169491525423729

701031,5,6303651984,"What can I say this movie had my attention, Molly Ringwalld played really well in this film. I love obsession movies and thats just what it was. It keeps you on your toes and wanting more. I recommend if you like drama films.",1340928000,2,225,4.255813953488372
701032,3,6303651984,"Bought it because I vaguely remembered seeing it quite a while ago.  Thought I remembered that it was a good movie.  Of course, the real attraction is Molly Ringwald, with her physical attributes on display.  Yeah, they are real, and they're lovely.  The movie...not so hot.",1338076800,3,274,4.891304347826087
701033,4,6303651984,This is Molly playing bad girl for us and she does an excellent job of being a crazy in love femme fatale. I like this movie for its dark charm and dark atmosphere plus it's a little creepy.,1304294400,2,190,4.026315789473684
701034,5,6303651984,Mediocre story.  Mediocre acting.  Molly Ringwald in her prime.  Molly Ringwald topless.  5 Stars for Molly.  You call it.,1294617600,4,122,5.2105263157894735

701036,3,6303651984,"This is a typical Fatal Attraction type movie. Nothing new or special (actually, it's a pretty bad film)....except that you get to see Molly Ringwald's breasts. Hey, if you're into that sort of thing, go for it. But I grew up in the 80's and I just can't get past the fact that The Breakfast Club's Claire is showing her boobs now. It's just weird.",1278720000,,348,4.369230769230769
701037,5,6303651984,"The DVD Malicious staring Molly Ringwald was Excellent, a true A+. Molly Ringwald was beautiful and seductive and what a great story. I would highly recommend this movie with 5 Stars--meaning worth your money and time.",1264032000,,218,5.083333333333333
701038,3,6303651984,"Molly Ringwald is great as a crazed college girl who will do ANYTHING to get the baseball player she loves-including murder, of course.  However, the rest of the film is formulaic and barely watchable.",1252713600,,201,4.911764705882353
701178,5,6303651984,Molly was excellent in the movie Malicious she brought her character to life. Wonderful job Molly as all of your movies you are one awesome beautiful actress a star is born in you Molly :-). Donnie,1244505600,,197,4.5

701181,3,6303651984,"Otherwise, this item is a cheap imitation of The Crush, Fear, Swimfan, etc.  But I like Molly - it was nice to see her in a different type of role, as well as the ""scene"" most people buy this movie for!",1210809600,4,202,3.926829268292683
701182,2,6303651984,"... this movie could have earned two stars more. This teenage version of Fatal Attraction is not without merits - the main character, a troubled girl played very convincingly by Molly Ringwald, is very well sketched but for some reasen the action had to be 'spiced up' by a whole array of totally improbable incidents. The aspiring game star angle is for another age group than mine (over 40).",1201478400,,393,4.7101449275362315
701183,3,6303651984,"Not a bad flick.  I don't remember the plot, but remember Molly.  If you are a Molly Ringwald fan, you will enjoy the movie.  Some waist up frontal nudity from Molly, but nothing terribly vulgar.",1186099200,,195,4.514285714285714
701184,2,6303651984,"Let's see, where have I seen elements of this movie before... ""Fatal Attraction, The Crush"" both roll off my tongue immediately, but I'm sure I've seen this story line many times more, and done better at that. An obssessed young lady sets her scope on the film's lead male role, a stud college baseball player and tests his morals, then leads him little by little to the inevitable path that we've seen all too often. This movie is merely a toy for the male demographic who probably grew up watching Molly Ringwald and always fantasized about her being in a role like this. Come to think of it, this may well have been the same thing for the director of this uninspired schlock. There's only one reason to watch this flick- Molly gets it! Oh boy, does Molly get it. But even that scene is a contrived setting with nill plausibility, as can be said for this movie in general. Molly's in a sexy role, which given the release date (95) may have been in desperation to shed her ""brat pack"" typecasting. Come to think of it, if that was the case, why did she even think about doing ""Townies,"" the ill fated sitcom attempt by the lucsious red-head. That aside, there's a good reason many haven't seen this flick. It didn't have a long run on any movie channels (not to mention the theater), so it was easy to miss. And its DVD release hasn't sounded anyone's alarms either. If you wanna see ""Samantha"" finally make it to the big leagues, go for it. But FYI, it's not a very explicit scene, not even late nite Cinemax caliber, but perhaps still satisfying enough for some. Otherwise, go for classic Molly stuff.",1183680000,7,1604,4.4965753424657535
701185,1,6303651984,"Okay, I'm glad to see Molly Ringwald getting away from typecasting by playing a bad girl character, but she could have picked a much better project.  Any project.

Ringwald is the only cast member with any real presence in this film, which as another reviewer accurately states, is a Fatal Attracton ripoff.  A minor league baseball player (I don't know who this guy is, but his performance was wooden, unbelievable and I had no sympathy for the prat) has a one night stand with Ringwald, and she goes overboard.

The guy was awful, his girlfriend's performance was equally bad.  There was not enough background to explain why Molly's character was such a bitch, other than apparently she was driven to massacre her parents.

God-Awful;  I saw this on cable awhile back, and after seeing it I know why.  You'll only see it on Lifetime or on one of those other networks when there's nothing else to run.",1106784000,6,902,4.7006369426751595
701186,4,6303651984,"This is a awesome movie. Anything with Molly Ringwald is hot though. She is so ... yet so freaky in this movie. I personally bought this movie as soon as I saw the one I rented. It stuns you after thinking about who this young virgin was, and than she plays this naughty girl who yerns for ... and devotion. It is a kick ... movie.  I recomend all the way.",1031961600,5,356,4.014084507042254
701187,3,6303651984,"Not a bad litte film ,it's faults are compensated for by the interest generated by Ringwald's departure from type. Good for her--she's not bad and the movie is watchable.",1015372800,6,170,4.896551724137931

7852661,3,6303651984,"The only reason I decided to watch this film is that I enjoy Molly Ringwald and certain thrillers like Basic Instinct. This feels more like a cheaply made Lifetime movie that drags along and doesn't fully pull you into the story.

A medical student (Molly Ringwald), obsessed with her school's star baseball player (Patrick McGaw), pursues him and finally manages to get him to spend the weekend with her. However, when he soon returns to his girlfriend, her anger at his ""betrayal"" causes her to go over the edge and places both her ex-lover's and his girlfriend's lives in danger.

Ringwald looks stunning and portrays a crazy scorned woman fine, but the cheapness of it all and stupid choices made by certain characters don't make it very believable. I also wonder how many times Ringwald's character smoked a cigarette in the film, you could probably make a drinking game out of it. Not to mention the annoying way she smokes them. A few nice sex scenes but other than that I see no reason to have this in your collection. The guy who plays the character she is obsessing over looks like he forgot how to act half the time. He's no Micheal Douglas that's for sure.",1503360000,,1168,4.63768115942029
