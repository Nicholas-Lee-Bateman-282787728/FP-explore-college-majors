2634387,4,B000HD1MVQ,"Overall, I love this dvd. I do have a few considerations I would like to mention...

1--I think it is incorrectly titled as it implies the content is actually Turkish dance. This dvd teaches Turkish inspired American Caberet Bellydance as the instructor implies in her introduction where she states this style developed in the restaurant/nightclubs in New York city in the 60's/70's and beyond.  As other reviewers noted the costume on the cover is also not traditionally Turkish, but more of a fusion style.  I gave the dvd one less star because of this concern. For those interested in a more purely Turkish dvd, I recommend Elizabeth Artemis Mourat's ""Turkish Style Belly Dance dvd.
2--This dvd really focuses on skirt work. The instructor does state that the skirt flourishes are a more recent fusion element rather than traditional Turkish dance. The emphasis on skirt flourishes make this dvd excellent for those wanting some basic skirt manipulation technique and not-so-great for those who are not as interested in skirt manipulation.

I liked several things about this dvd:
1--The bonus section features a 20 minute costume workshop. Sarah Skinner has an excellent eye for costuming!  She demonstrates how different skirts, hip belts, arm decoration and bras can enhance the dance and offers many useful tips. I would love to see Sarah Skinner create a dvd on this topic as this was my favorite part of the dvd. I gave it an extra star because I like this section so much.
2--The performance segment offers an amazing and beautiful example of Turkish-inspired American Bellydance.
3--I liked the introduction including reference to her teachers, the style she is dancing and the music used.
4--The production quality is good and the instructors movements are always clear and visable.

The instruction is good and will be useful for dancers of beginning to intermediate level who are interested in an American-Turkish fusion style.",1183334400,18,1940,5.1234177215189876
2634388,5,B000HD1MVQ,This is a really fun dvd for beginning dancers. Sarah teaches two very cute dances and her instruction is easy to follow. The section on costuming alone makes this dvd worth the price!,1182816000,4,184,4.606060606060606
2634389,3,B000HD1MVQ,"I bought this DVD just to look at and get ideas for costume making - and this DVD is a great inspiration for that as it has a section set aside for costume making. Sarah's costumes are gorgeous - aaah those skirts - I want them! As I am sure you will too.

The choreographies are ok, but I will change them a little to suit my own style, I like the music Sarah used. And as a drummer (Drummer/Dancer) I found myself watching and listening to the drummers instead of watching Sarah dance. I may have to go back later and watch Sarah (sorry Sarah) ha ha. But I found it useful as i was able to play along with the drummers.

But all in all - I would recommend this DVD for those of you who are as mad on dancing and drumming as I am. And it is reasonably priced.",1179014400,5,760,3.9607843137254903
2634390,5,B000HD1MVQ,Belly dancing is hard exercise.  The movements are shown and explained quite well.  She a very good dancer.  Not all dances are the same.  I wanted to learn more Turkish than Egyptian and this is helping a great deal.,1178668800,7,217,4.487179487179487
2634391,5,B000HD1MVQ,"I bought this video when I wasn't able to find a Turkish-style instructor in my area.  I've been taking Egyptian style bellydance classes for several years now.  For those of you with Egyptian experience,  you're going to see a lot of moves you recognize, and a few you haven't.

The dances taught in this video are pretty easy and should not be a problem for anyone with a grasp of basic technique.  Sarah does a good job of explaining how the moves are done, and with her costume and the background being what they are, it is really easy to see what she is doing and how to do it.  She is pretty good about breaking down the moves without too much repetition.  The only reason I say it would be easier for someone with basic skills is that it takes a while to learn how to do shimmies, especially the ""choo choo"" shimmy if you have never done them before.  Sarah has a pleasant voice, and seems to really enjoy what she is doing.  The camera does a good job of staying where it is supposed to be unlike many of the instructional videos on the market.

The costume section in the beginning of the video is great and I'd like to see more of this sort of thing.

I gave this video 5 stars, but in reality I'd like to give it a 4.5.  Why?  In the instructional sections of the video you have a choice of using just instruction, or instruction of sections, and each section followed with you dancing along with her performance, going back to the beginning each time.  I really liked learning this way, but some of their splices weren't so good and a few pieces were missing.  In Mastika she tells you to swing your arms as if you were walking in the beginning if the song, while in her demonstration she has her hands on her hips for the first section.  It's not a big flaw, but it's a bit disconcerting the first few times you're trying to dance along with the instructor and she's not doing what she told you to do.

I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to give Turkish dance a try, especially if you like the way the skirtwork looks.  The dances are fun and relatively easy to learn, and I think skirtwork can do a lot for a beginner's confidence.  It gives you a ""prop"" to hold on to, and can look very impressive without being very complicated.  If you're interested in learning a little bit about Turkish style dance, get some great ideas about costuming, and learn 2 cute little dances to show to your friends/significant other, then this video is a great buy!  There is a lot of content for the price.

I hope to see a lot more videos from this instructor.",1178668800,8,2573,4.3056133056133055
2634392,4,B000HD1MVQ,"Really enjoy this dvd and workout to it regularly.  You could tell that Sarah took a great deal of time to put this dvd together.  She tells about the origins of Turkish bellydance.  What really sets this dvd apart from others is her costuming workshop.  Sarah has a fantastic eye and knowledge of putting together costumes.  She teaches 2 Turkish bellydance choegraphies that are lively.  She breaks them down really well, with and without music.  She has such a lovely personality that just comes across on the videos and makes learning the cheorographies so much fun.  She also includes several performances showing her in different costumes.  She is beautiful to watch and learn from.  If she came out with more instructional dvds in the future, I would most definitely purchase.",1174953600,6,783,4.953846153846154
2634393,5,B000HD1MVQ,"I really enjoyed this DVD!  Sarah does a lovely job teaching two different choreographies and performing them beforehand.  I met her in Dayton, OH last year and was very impressed with her dancing and personality.",1174003200,6,213,5.057142857142857
2634394,5,B000HD1MVQ,"Unburdened by any expectations or any knowledge of Turkish dancing, of videos that teach Turkish dancing or of Sarah Skinner for that matter, I found this DVD a... well, a Turkish delight. Sarah Skinner is very, very feminine and graceful. She even looks like she's dancing when she's actually sitting down to explain a bit of background to Turkish bellydance. If there's anything at all I expected, it was for Turkish dancing to be downright difficult, and on this DVD, it is not, which must mean it's aimed entirely at the beginner. Come armed with some basic knowledge of belly dance isolations--and a beautiful swishy skirt--and you can do it.

I liked the opening chat about Turkish dancing because it put things in perspective from the start. Sarah next goes on to a wonderful and colorful costume workshop. The problem with that is ending up wanting every one of those skirts and accessories.

The three performances that come after the costume workshop are a visual delight. There's one to a Chiftitelli (slow sensual rhythm) that I would really love to learn. There's also a joyful veil performance. And a graceful drum solo. Very pretty, each of these.

The instruction follows the same format that many of the recent dvds from World Dance New York are using. There's a demo of the whole dnace, then a break up of each combination (there are 9 and 11 of them for the two dances taught). There's also a menu item with which you can move on to the step by step breakdown followed by trying it out with music.

Sarah is a very nice teacher. Gentle and unhurried. She gives you safety tips and warms you away from the mistakes you could make. The most remarkable thing of all is that these moves are within the reach of the beginner. I have done about a year and a half of video-only learning and I tend to not account for people taking classes in addition to working with a video. If you're stuck where there are no classes, this is entirely possible to do because the moves selected are easier ones. People who are already familiar with Turkish dancing and other videos on this genre obvioiusly won't be challenged but may still like to pick up the two choreographies--inexpensively and easily. In that sense, I think the title may be a bit misleading as it may signal that this is meant for people who are already well into Turkish belly dancing or are outright advanced.

Overall, very graceful, an absolute visual treat, well selected and doable moves and charmingly and gently taught. As is usual for this group, it's value for money -- 21 combinations to work with.",1171411200,26,2578,4.669603524229075
2634395,5,B000HD1MVQ,"Sara Skinner's, "" I love Turkish Belly Dance"" program is a fun, learning experience.

Learn 2 lively and bouncy Turkish style dances,each performed in a beautiful, flowing skirt. These flirty, skirt fusion dances include simple footwork, flirting with the audience usng level changes, while swishing your skirt!! These routines are set to two popular Turkish party songs, ""Rompi,Rompi and ""Mastika."" Each routine includes a demonstration and a follow along segment with music and instruction.

Sarah is a delightful instructor, and really connects with her audience. She patiently takes you through a bonus costume educational segment explaining and sharing tips on styles, how to's and much more.

Sara also shares breathing tips for dancing useful in performing the kashlima step set to 9/8 rhythym.

Included are 3 performances by Sarah; a drum solo, a veil dance, and a  ciftitelli to greatly contribute to the already established enjoyment of this learning program. A lot to offer for the novice dancer; a good introduction and learning experience for the serious student/dancer or those just becoming famiiar with skirt fusion, or those attemtping to piece together a bellydance costume.",1171065600,10,1193,5.427027027027027
2634396,3,B000HD1MVQ,"I am a teacher of Egyptian Belly Dance primarily, but also teach Turkish style belly dance steps in my classes.  Several of my students have been asking me about this new DVD.

First, let me say that the DVD has many charms and is best suited to beginner/advanced beginner students, but that for the serious intermediate/advanced and professional teacher or performer there are stronger, academically attentive and more thorougly researched DVDs on the market.  Miss Sarah Skinner cites Eva Cernik, Dalia and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat as among her teachers.  I have had the pleasure and honor of studying with these accomplished master teacher and performers as well and recommend their DVDs/VHS tapes for turkish (Eva and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat) and dynamic skirt dance/fusion styles (Dalia's video media and a superb music CD).

For the Beginner and Advanced Beginner student this DVD includes at least one turkish traveling step I have seen taught by Eva and Artemis- and is a good start for a student with no previous knowledge base.  American fusion type skirt dancing steps are also included also helpful for the beginner.  There are simple choregraphies throughout the DVD well executed that will be helpful to beginner students, but frankly lack the fire, passion, and wild, playful abandon that for me is so quintissentialy turkish.

The costuming section is an excellent rundown for students, teachers and performers and the strongest section of the DVD.  In fact Ms. Skinner has a great eye for costumes and color combinations and I would love to see a DVD from her in the future focusing solely on this topic.  I am not sure if there are any up to date DVDs in recent years on this topic currently on the market at the moment.

The veil number was very beautiful and again a great study for beginners and others who may not be ready to or want to do complex turns and intricate veil combinations.  This number gives great ideas for ""still"" shots and dramatic poses that are audience eye catching.  The costume here was elegant and Sarah is a very pretty dancer with flowing dark hair who carries off the mood of this piece spledindly.  I did find it odd, though that the music was a classic Andalusian piece, sung in spanish- on a DVD touting ""Turkish"" dance.

Overall, a useful DVD for beginners with lots of great costume and still shot pose ideas...However, perhaps a different choice in title touting the many rich and various threads of the fusion style belly dance taught and perforemd in this DVD would have more aptly described the total DVD.",1169337600,90,2563,4.8597701149425285
2634397,5,B000HD1MVQ,I  chose this rating because this DVD was recommended by my dance instructor.  I would like to have had the written instructions for the routines.,1399248000,,146,4.8
2634398,5,B000HD1MVQ,"Not only do you learn about the different types of outfits to wear and what the different styles mean, but the dances are easy to follow along with. Great instruction for intermediate dancers, but I think even beginners could follow along with no knowledge of broken down basic steps.",1379116800,,284,4.816326530612245
2634399,5,B000HD1MVQ,"This is a great DVD. You get tips on costuming. The breakdown of the dance steps are easy to follow. What I like is that she shows you the entire routine first. Then the first breakdown of the steps without music, then with music. Then the next breakdown without and with the music THEN she has you start from the beginning and adds each new breakdown. After a new break down of steps is learned you start from the beginning again. You repeat this process until the routine is completed. And the repetition really gets ingrained in your learning the routine This is one DVD you will love This is great for all levels of dancers",1350000000,,627,4.413793103448276
2634400,5,B000HD1MVQ,"Another winner for Sarah Skinner. Not only did she give a great overview of costuming, but she presented two really cute dances that most anyone could enjoy learning. The practice outfit she wore was perfect to instruct others on the movements. And her performance costume had a fabulous skirt (although it was not the one on the video cover, which was nowhere in sight for some reason).

Now I, too, love Turkish bellydance! Rompi, Rompi! What a fun video. I loved the playful style with little hops and the swishy skirt work. This is definitely a DVD to watch and enjoy over and over again.

Note: There was one section that had a bad video cut just left dangling for no reason. To avoid blunders like this, video editors really should watch the final video very carefully before rendering it, especially when producing a professional video. However, it only detracted slightly from the instruction. Just get the video and enjoy feeling empowered to bellydance!",1327881600,,963,4.865853658536586
2634401,3,B000HD1MVQ,"I like Sarah. I like her way of speaking, I enjoy how expressive she is, and how charming she is. This is a very nice DVD if you are a beginning dancer who would like to learn a choreography. I enjoyed looking at Sarah's costumes in this dvd and will be in my sewing room trying to recreate the sparkly belts she was showing us. The choreographies are good for beggining belly dancers. I was hoping for a break down of the Turkish dance style here, but there were only two choreographies. No real explanation of Turkish or the raw elements that can be used outside of those choreographies. But I can't get over what a good speaker Sarah is and how fun she is to watch and listen to.",1308268800,,682,4.253846153846154
2634402,5,B000HD1MVQ,Really good starting point for skirt work. Loved her sit down chat about costuming as well.,1257292800,,91,4.75
2634403,5,B000HD1MVQ,"Though the box is not labeled for level of training, this terrific instruction DVD is geared towards beginning students, and if you are familiar with folk dancing or basic bellydancing, you won't have any trouble assimilating the choreography, which is quite simple, especially since the steps are broken down and explained in detail, and demonstrated to perfection by the lovely Sarah Skinner.

Perhaps the most valuable portion of this DVD is the Costume Workshop, where Sarah shows us some of her glorious costume collection (some of it worn in the dance sections, so one can see it in motion). This is an A to Z workshop, with information that is hard to obtain elsewhere, and costumes are a vital part of bellydancing in general, and Turkish dance in particular, as Sarah demonstrates in the use of the flowing and swirling skirts while dancing. You'll get great tips on what to buy, how to personalize it, make it comfortable, and make it last, as these gorgeous costumes can be quite an investment.

In her ""Welcome"" section, Sarah speaks of the Turkish cabaret dancing that exploded on the dance scene in New York in the 70's, and how we are now learning from those dancers who are now teachers, the teachers she studied with, and how this form of dance keeps flourishing.  We also get 3 performance pieces that are wonderful; a veil dance, a ciftetelli, and a drum solo.

The 2 dances that Sarah teaches, ""Rompi Rompi"" and ""Mastika,"" are fun ""party dance"" numbers, make for great exercise when you get going with them, and being choreographically easy, you can let go and really feel the freedom of dancing without too much strain. If you're a beginning dancer, this DVD is sure to give you the ""dance bug"" and you will be hooked for life...and have Sarah to thank for it!",1216339200,4,1781,4.735483870967742
2634404,5,B000HD1MVQ,The Turkish Belly dancing is creative and warm. It is like the Arabic belly dancing but has more charm.  Sarah Skinner gives you a good idea about the choregraphy and magic of this great art and style.,1212364800,,201,4.4324324324324325
2634405,5,B000HD1MVQ,"Sarah Skinner defines Turkish dance and teaches a fun, flirty choreography.  If you have never
tried Turkish dance, get this DVD and try it!  She gives clear instruction that can be followed by
anyone, great breathing tips and a section on costuming that has some excellent advice, but be
careful... you might drool over some of the costumes!  She also touches on layering and relating
to the audience.  If you have a bubbly personality or love flying skirts, try this!",1209254400,,469,4.825
2634406,3,B000HD1MVQ,I should have known this was not what I wanted.  Sorry an advanced dancer so the moves were way to simple.  Okay for begginners that are looking for a taste of the dance as need is there but no teachers or no chance to get in a class.  I have over 13 DVDS to have mastered Egyption belly dance as I am trying to master other versions.  Those striking out to learn on their own I commend you as just keep the info you gather as the building blocks of your dance.,1200268800,3,461,3.9782608695652173

8138562,2,B000HD1MVQ,"In the late Sixties, I lived in Izmir for a couple of years.  As a young man,  I was at the pavyons every nite and saw well over a thousand belly dancers.  Not a single dancer danced anything like Ms. Skinner.  They all danced something akin to the Dance of the Seven Veils.  Some removed only five veils,  some removed all seven.  About half the dancers used finger bells.",1486339200,3,373,4.318840579710145

8138565,1,B000HD1MVQ,"Forewarning:  I am a Turkish Oryantal and Turkish Romani dancer.

I own this, and actually just got around to watching it for the first time today.

Please do not judge and attempt Turkish dance based on this video series.  Except for Ms. Skinner, I have never seen a true Turkish style dancer do skirt work.  Maybe lift the skirt a little in Romani to show off foot work, but there is no swishing around like a Mexican Folklorico or Spanish Zambra dancer.

I'll say it again.  There is NO SKIRT WORK.  If you think there is, please forward on examples, as I haven't seen it in all my years of observing, learning and annotating true Turkish dancers.

Turkish belly dance is athletic and has an air of attitude behind it.  I sure didn't see any of it in this DVD.

If you are truly interested in Turkish Oryantal and Romani dance and are looking for a DVD, I strongly encourage you to get Artemis Mourat's DVD instead. It's worth every penny.  If you are an intermediate dancer, go look up Ruby Beh's Totally Turkish as well.",1468195200,4,1025,4.451612903225806
8138566,4,B000HD1MVQ,"Better suited for true Beginners. It includes  Turkish traveling steps which is a good start for a student with no previous knowledge base. American fusion type skirt dancing is quite comprehensive for the beginner.  Well executed simple choreographies just wish it had more umph and passion
 The area for costuming is wonderful and comprehensive . The color combinations made by the instructor are superb, I wish that part was longer or perhaps she could do a DVD just about this. The veil part was exquisite. The instructor also gives great ideas for posing which are quite dramatic and eye catching.  Overall great for the library and practice of a true beginner.",1437868800,,666,4.972972972972973
8138567,4,B000HD1MVQ,"I really liked the section on costuming...it was quite thorough....and Sarah is a beautiful and talented dancer....since I have experience with dance for many years and have encountered other teachers in Turkish style, I have to say that the choreography is geared more to beginning/intermediate level.  I would like to have seen more of a linear breakdown for each sequence of the choreography.  I think the short teaching pieces presented a more fragmented approach and the flow of the dance did not come out until the end.",1427760000,,525,5.022988505747127
8138568,2,B000HD1MVQ,"Given that it has been a very, very long time since I regularly belly danced, that my physical stamina is not what it used to be, and I was looking for a way to ease back into things, I was actually fine with ordering something other reviews claimed was best for beginners.  I would say this wasn't just for beginners, it was for beginners with no ambition to do anything more than take a few hoping steps and swish their skirts around.  Even the costume workshop was disappointing.  She pretty much just held up a variety of costume pieces and pointed out the differences between them rather than explaining how to go about finding or making such pieces.  Not exactly the kind of workshop I'm looking for.  Honestly, you can find more useful resources, both dance steps and costume construction/alteration, for free on youtube.",1410220800,5,828,4.722222222222222
