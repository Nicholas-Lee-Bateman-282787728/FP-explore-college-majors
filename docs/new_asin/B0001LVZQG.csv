8014165,2,B0001LVZQG,"This film is a low-budget tale of a small-time fence and police informer who cannot seem to successfully deal with a corrupt police department, and with his friends. Some good acting is managed along with sporadically interesting direction, and oftimes creative camerawork, despite a trite and muddled script. William McNamara's principal expression (deer in headlights), is appropriate for his part, while Jay Acovone steals each scene in which he appears in this work, filmed completely within that assault upon the senses, Los Angeles' Skid Row. Attempts at humour are welcome, but a better script would have been necessary to make this an artistic success.",1111795200,,660,5.355769230769231
