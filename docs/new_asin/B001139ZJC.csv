8240054,5,B001139ZJC,"Wow! What a wake-up call for the current American suburban life style and the often dysfunctional values that sustain it. From our hour-plus commutes in mind numbing traffic, to our grossly overpriced cookie-cutter tract homes, to the always busy, busy, busy moms and dads shuttling kids from one programmed activity to another, this is a shocking and all too accurate portrait of the American ""anxious class.""

It is unlikely that anybody could watch this 90-minute mocumentary without sensing their daily personal reality slapping them in the face. This powerful video brought to mind the lyrics of John Lennon from a bygone era, ""A working class hero is so hard to be. They keep you doped on religion, sex and TV. And you think you're so clever and classless and free. But you're still [just] peasants as far as I can see!"" Perhaps it's time for all of us to reevaluate the American dream... that is unless your house is already in foreclosure.",1247702400,3,947,4.845679012345679
8240055,5,B001139ZJC,"Outstanding documentary on why people choose the suburbs and what they find when they get there.  Outstanding commentary is interspersed with interviews of a family that is engaging from the get go (I hope the boy has an agent--loved him!).  Funny, interesting, sad, it serves as a cry for something different.",1241049600,,310,5.0588235294117645
8240056,5,B001139ZJC,"i really enjoyed this dvd.  the topic is timely, the photography is stark but beautiful and the actors are appealing.  in addition, the movie is funny with just a tinge of terror.  it's imbued with subtle canadian humor.",1205107200,6,220,4.7368421052631575

8240058,5,B001139ZJC,"Critical view of suburbia by a filmmaker who grew up there. Interviews with realtors, experts on city planning and architecture, mixed in with footage of the Moss family's daily routines. Never boring and very educational. Basically spells out why things seem so bleak and everyone needs anti-depressants to cope. (HINT: Its not because of a chemical imbalance in the brain, as your body's reaction to your environment is quite natural) Should be mandatory viewing by all. Other documentaries about suburbia I recommend are: The End of Suburbia, Escape from Suburbia, Subdivided, Gimme Green.",1199145600,6,592,5.376344086021505
