398189,5,6301964055,"The Andy Hardy series of the 1930s and 1940s will forever stand as the epitome of wholesome, thoroughly enjoyable family entertainment, and these wonderful films did much to make Mickey Rooney a superstar and guaranteed money-making actor.  Love Finds Andy Hardy, the fourth of sixteen films about Judge Hardy's family, is regarded by many fans to be the best of the bunch (although I prefer Andy Hardy Meets Debutante), due in no small part to the introduction of Betsy Booth, who comes from New York to Carvel to spend Christmas with her grandparents.  Judy Garland, a year before achieving superstardom in The Wizard of Oz, is simply adorable as Betsy, a cute and oh-so-talented young lady whom Andy dotes on as a child; even though her huge crush on Andy never quite meets with reciprocating feelings on his part, she selflessly saves the day time and again for the antic-prone Andy.  You have to be really smart to get into the kind of trouble Andy gets in, she says, and boy oh boy is this the truth.
You can't help but love Andy-Mickey Rooney is unashamedly goofy, unbelievably energetic yet quick to wallow in the messes of his own making; he literally was the all-American boy of the post-Depression era.  In this film, Andy wants a car, and he wants it before December 24 so that he can drive his sweetie Polly (Ann Rutherford) to the big dance.  Without telling his father (played by Lewis Stone), he gives the local car dealer twelve of the twenty dollars he needs for his chosen car, promising to pay the remaining eight dollars by the 24th.  Herein lies the start of his problems.  Andy is crushed when he learns Polly will be out of town for three weeks, yet opportunity seems to knock politely on his door when his friend Beezy promises to pay him eight dollars plus expenses to date up his own girl while he is away.  Thus does Andy begin a courtship of Cynthia Potter (Lana Turner).  Betsy Booth arrives next door with a preexisting crush on Andy, one which should be easily obvious even to the reckless-minded fellow, yet he never fails to describe her as a child.  Frankly, Andy is something of a fool; there has never been a cuter young lady on this earth than Judy Garland during her teen years; if Betsy Booth would have grinned and done that little nose wrinkle thing for me, I would have fallen at her feet.  Anyway, and predictably, Andy's plans all go astray.  At one point, he is looking at the prospect of two dates to the dance and no car at all.  With a friend like Betsy Booth, however, he need not have worried about his precious social reputation being ruined.
Judy Garland absolutely steals the show here.  As I have said, she is not only cute as a button but beautiful in every way.  Betsy just wants to be seen as a young lady rather than a child, and her feelings on this issue are expressed perfectly in the song In Between (crafted by her musical mentor Roger Edens).  She does get to be grown up and glamorous for one night, though, marking the occasion with unforgettable performances of the songs It Never Rains But What It Pours and Meet the Beat of My Heart (half of it, anyway, as the other half plus an additional number, Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen, were cut from the final print).
Judy Garland would return in two later Andy Hardy films, but more importantly, Love Finds Andy Hardy served as the true beginning of the Garland-Rooney phenomenon that wowed audiences over the course of the next few years.  The two first appeared in the 1937 film Thoroughbreds Don't Cry, and the obvious chemistry between the two set the stage for her entry into the Andy Hardy films.  Garland was never more loveable than she was in the role of Betsy Booth, and films such as Love Finds Andy Hardy have a very special place in the heart of this Judy Garland fanatic.",1067644800,40,3793,4.536656891495602
398190,4,6301964055,"The 4th movie from the Andy Hardy series, ""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is probably the best of the entire series. It's interesting to see Judy Garland before she made ""Oz."" This was her next to last picture before filming ""The Wizard of Oz."" Her voice is remarkable. By the way, while this movie was in production, Judy was in a car accident that produced 3 broken ribs, a sprained back, and a punctured lung. Can you imagine singing and acting with that?",1010188800,,450,4.5
398191,5,6301964055,"After MGM wasted Judy's talent for a few years after she was signed in 1935, and put her in a few dud pictures that didn't help her stardom one bit, they put her in this picture with Mickey Rooney, a winning combination!
When viewing this film it is interesting to note that it was filmed in omly 19 days, but then again Metro Goldwen Mayer was the ""dream factory""!
Judy plays in this film Betsy Booth, a well-to-do girl who is visiting the house next door to Andy's when she meets him and is attracted to him, but he not to her. This makes for some interesting comical situations, since Andy alreay has a girlfriend!
Since this is Judy Garland, there is plenty of singing thrown in to sweeten the pot!
But I warn you, once you view this film, you will want to buy the other Andy Hardy pictures that Judy co-stars in. I would say, go ahead, as long as it's Mickey and Joots (Mickey's name for Judy) it's sure to be a winner!
In Judy's career her very next film would sign her signature into stardom, The Wizard of Oz.
Next after that was Babes in Arms. If you love Love Finds Any Hardy, you'll love Babes in Arms! It contains that winning combination of Mickey and Joots, so how could you go wroung?
You Can't!

Without her help, the scheming two-timing Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney) would have had more than his fair share of trouble to deal with.  The best part of this movie is that Judy gets to sing three songs.  Otherwise, the humor is slathered on in the heavy handed fashion of the day (monopolized by Rooney's turbulent performance).  The story is a bit involved as a conveying Andy seeks to own a car he's not supposed to have, while cheating on his girlfriend Polly (Ann Rutherford) for 8 bucks to pay off the car he's not supposed to have.  There's a dance and a short supply of dates for poor Andy who opines, ""I just can't go out with any girl, she's gotta be a knockout!""  Why that little toad figured he rated only ""sensational girls"" is anyone's guess.  Especially considering the minimal height requirement.  For good measure, they also toss in a sad tale of a grandma who may or may not be dying in time for Christmas!  The only thing missing from this movie was a tornado!

398274,5,6301964055,"""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" (1938) is the fourth and arguably best of the 15 original Hardy Family films in the MGM series from the 30s and 40s.  (There was a 16th Hardy film, ""Andy Hardy Comes Home,"" in the 50s, featuring the adult Andy returning to Carvel as an attorney, with brief appearances by sister Marion, their mother Emily, and Aunt Milly.)

The Hardy Family movies are, in my opinion, the most enjoyable film series from the Golden Age of Hollywood (followed closely by the Thin Man and the Dr. Kildare/Dr. Gillepsie series).  These films give us an entertaining and heartwarming snapshot of small-town life in the 30s and 40s with a focus on the relationship between an energetic teenage boy and his understanding father.

Mickey Rooney became the world's most popular movie star -- no kidding, he really was the top star from 1939 to 1941 -- primarily because of these Hardy films and the musicals he made with Judy Garland (as well some other great performances in movies like ""Boys Town"" and ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"").

The Hardy Family films really deserve a nice box set.  They're movies that still provide a lot of entertainment, as well as a few life lessons along the way.  As the numerous comments here show, there's a big audience for these movies.

Should it be any surprise that the Hardy Family series is still so well-loved?  What else would you expect from a series that starred the top movie actor in the world, that won a special Academy Award for MGM, and that featured, in early roles, future stars like Judy Garland, Lana Turner, Kathryn Grayson, Donna Reed, and Esther Williams? The only surprise here is that the entire series isn't on DVD yet.

So far, however, ""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is the only Hardy film released on DVD (besides off-label DVDs of the similarly named ""Love Laughs at Andy Hardy,"" the finale of the original 15 Hardy movies, which appears to have fallen out of copyright protection).

""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is a wonderful tale of Andy at Christmastime in Carvel, wondering how he's going to come up with 8 bucks (or 8 ""dollars,"" as Judge Hardy corrects his slang) to finish paying for the used jalopy he needs for the drive to the Christmas Eve dance.  Even though Andy has a very pretty girlfriend, Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford), he gets mixed up with Cynthia Potter (Lana Turner!) because Polly is going to be out of town and Andy just has to have an impressive date for the dance.  Well, of course, things don't work out as planned, and the younger Betsy Booth (Judy Garland), who's in Carvel to visit her grandparents for the holidays, comes to the rescue.  (This was Judy's first of three Hardy Family movies, although she and Mickey had previously appeared together in ""Thoroughbreds Don't Cry."")

If you like classic movies, especially those featuring the younger actors that MGM was so good at developing, you'll love this movie.  Mickey and Judy are at their best here, with Mickey amply demonstrating the wide-ranging acting talent that made him the most popular movie star in the world the next year, and Judy demonstrating both the innocence and great singing that brought her the most beloved role of her career the next year as well -- Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz.""

The rest of the cast is also excellent.  Top-billed Lewis Stone as Judge Hardy provides fatherly guidance, Fay Holden is Andy's loving mom, and Cecilia Parker is older sister Marion, who isn't too old to bicker with her brother once in a while.  The only flaw in the outstanding cast is that Sara Haden, who was always perfect as the sensible Aunt Milly, was inexplicably replaced here (and in one other Hardy film) by Betty Ross Clarke, who's just adequate.  Among the very good supporting cast members are Marie Blake (later seen as Granny in ""The Addams Family"") and Gene Reynolds (appearing as a boy with a much-needed ham radio here, but later an Emmy-winning producer/director/writer of the MASH TV show).

If you haven't seen this movie yet, or have caught it on TCM and would like your own copy, you'll be very glad you bought this DVD.  I never tire of this movie -- at our home, we've watched the entire Hardy series 8 or 9 times over the past 20 years (on home-recorded tapes and DVDs, except for this movie), and ""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" remains our favorite.

In the mean time, keep hoping that Warner Home Video comes out with the Hardy Family box set that's long been promised.",1314576000,,4441,4.701935483870968

There are 16 films in the series. (In the 16th Andy is all grown up). Eight films are available on DVD, and three more on Amazon-Instant-Video or VHS. See my comment under ""comment"" button below for a list of Andy Hardy films and descriptions.

A pleasant series of relationships during a time in America, which I remember, when the towns were small, everyone knew each other, and the family sat down together for dinner. Andy Hardy is very enthusiastic, which fits Mickey Rooney's real-life, personality.

If you like Mickey Rooney in this series, you might also like to see him in ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" (1939) VHS or DVD. I enjoyed the Huck Finn movie more as a kid, but there are several classic, scenes that I enjoyed seeing again.",1278460800,,1013,4.738636363636363
398276,5,6301964055,"I really like this series (Andy Hardy films). This one's got great some great scenes in it, like a local kid with a ham radio set who helps Mr. Hardy and Andy contact a kid in another city to get an emergency message to the mom, paralleling modern culture and the internet (the kids are more into tech than the parents). Other great scenes include when Andy is able to buy a car, and of course the big scene when Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland are at the dance and she turns out to be the belle of the ball. This movie (as with all the Andy Hardy movies I've seen) showcase the importance of the family, respect for elders and for the law (Andy's dad is a judge). They give a great glimpse into teenage life in the 30s and 40s (or at least one, popular, aspect of it). In many ways it is naive and saccharine, but it shows an America that valued family and personal responsibility, even if it wasn't always realistic. It's a great juxtaposition to the East Side kids movies, which are also fascinating slices of teenage life of that era. This DVD has a Christmas message from the Hardy family (intriguing in its breaking of the fourth wall), a radio promo with the whole theme song and a wonderful introduction by a Judy Garland biographer with Ann Rutherford (who played Andy's girlfriend... and Nancy Drew, in a whole different series!).",1265846400,,1339,4.4471544715447155

Trouble is, he's more or less promised to take good ole Polly Benedict (Ann Rutherford) too!  And when bright-eyed Betsy Booth (Judy Garland) starts swooning as well, poor Andy begins to wish that kissing had never been invented...

Judy Garland's entry into the Andy Hardy films ushered her into the hearts of film fans all over the world.  She'd appear in three more of the titles, as well as a series of special musicals with Mickey Rooney (including STRIKE UP THE BAND and BABES IN ARMS).  They were such good friends--both on and off the screen--and you can simply tell they were having a ball here.  Only one year away from her legendary performance as Dorothy in THE WIZARD OF OZ, Garland sings three thrilling numbers (""In-Between"", ""It Never Rains But What It Pours"" and ""Meet the Beat of My Heart"").

398326,4,6301964055,"Love Finds Andy Hardy is the first film to feature Betsy Booth (Judy Garland), a sweet girl from New York that instantly takes a liking to Andy (Mickey Rooney). He is oblivious however, because he has to worry about two other girls. First, there is Polly (Ann Rutherford), his steady girlfriend who is going out of town for three weeks before Christmas. Then, there is Cynthia (Lana Turner), Andy's friend's girlfriend. Andy is being paid to take her out so no other guy tries to steal her away, but she's a pain in the neck.

This film is one of the better ones of the Andy Hardy series and it features a great cast. Mickey Rooney is insanely hyper in the movie, which can either be annoying or endearing. He certainly is a character, and although Andy Hardy is immature, it is funny to contrast the character to the man. Incidentally, the film sort of mirrors the real-life interactions of the stars. Rooney was taken by Turner's glamourous looks and claims to have gotten her pregnant when they were young in his book. Garland felt she was not glamourous enough so she hated the way she looked in movies, possibly because of lack of attention from Rooney. It is hard to see why she could not appreciate herself though; she is wonderful. Her singing is just as good here as in later years too.

All in all, this is a fun film, a great way to spend time with the family or alone. Any age can enjoy it.",1152057600,,1402,4.430232558139535
398327,5,6301964055,"Like the Little Rascals/Our Gang comedies the Andy Hardy series of films are ageless. Louis B.Mayer often liked sentimental films that idolized America and the Andy Hardy Series is an example of this. ""LB"" took a special interest in this series and his hand is all over it. Mayer was often criticized for ordering MGM to make these kinds of movies and musicals but history has shown he was right. After he lost control of MGM in 1951 the studio went on to produce message pictures and other kinds of films. The public hated them. The Worst was 1959's Raintree County which was a cheap rip-off of Gone With The Wind. Mickey Rooney was the star of the series but Silent Era superstar Lewis Stone comes in 2nd as Judge Hardy. Ironic that these kinds of films were viewed as hokey by the emerging young producers and directors of the late 40's and early 50's, that took over and ultimately ruined then destroyed MGM, are the kinds the studios have been scrambling to bring back since the early 1980's. Mr. Mayer was 50 years ahead of his time !.",1133136000,9,1041,4.5132275132275135
398328,4,6301964055,"I'd never seen an Andy Hardy film but I'd read that they reflected L.B. Mayer's delusional vision of American, full of sanctimonious lectures about the virtues of clean, small town living.  But if ""Love finds Andy Hardy"" is typical of the series, then this view is both harsh and narrow.  Yes, this is a story about a very white, very Christian small town but there aren't many lectures and the story is simple and unpretentious which allows the actors to develop their characters.  The film suggest a way of living that allows for disagreement, sibling rivalry, unrequited love but doesn't transform any of that into pathos or moral tales.  Instead, scenes unfold naturally and easily with a certain sweetness that is warm and inviting not cloying and artificial.  Maybe this film has worn well because in its simplicity is a portrait of a period of American culture that seems geniune and lost forever.  It doesn't feel dated because the film doesn't aspire to be ahead of the times but very much of it.
Clearly this is Mickey Rooney's movie.  I've never been fond of him as an actor.  His mugging and frentic energy make me turn away in embarrassment.  However, in this film there are many moments when his enthusiasm is more infectious than his mugging is distracting.  He works well with Lewis Stone and Judy Garland.  Also he conveys his internal dilemma dealing with two girls with comedy and concern.  There are also many moments when he hams it up so I don't want to mislead anyone!  But at least I could see why he was so popular which is something that had escaped me despite watching several of the Garland-Rooney musicals.
The reason I watched this film was to see Judy Garland and I wasn't disappointed.  This film was shot shortly before, ""Wizard of Oz"" and she is awkward and somewhat unfocused but alas she is Judy Garland which means despite her lack of maturity, she is the best thing in the film.  Her musical numbers are delightful and her predicament of being too young for Mickey is touching and sweet.  Sure, she doesn't know what to do with her hands and occasionally mugs for the camera but at sixteen Judy Garland is clearly bursting with talent, promise and excitement.",1085443200,9,2197,4.712041884816754
398329,4,6301964055,"MGM recently released five films in DVD format as a tribute to Judy Garland and one of the titles is LOVE FINDS ANDY HARDY. Though the movie was released in honor of Garland, it really is Mickey Rooney's film. He plays the loveable teenaged Andy Hardy. Young Sandy has a heart of gold but often seems to get things mixed up a bit which lead to his easily solved difficulties. His problem in this movie is one that follows him in other films: girls. He is supposed to take one girl to a dance, but she cannot go, so he agrees to take another, but then meets a third. Of course one of the girls becomes available again, and the whole situation becomes a mess. Yet in true Hollywood from, all ends happily ever after.
The film has quite a few strengths. First, it does take us back to another place and time when life's problems could easily be solved by the wisdom of Dad and a dose of common sense. Families were dedicated to one anther and communities were close-knit and wholesome. While it is not all that original a film, somehow it is not clich&eacute;. We believe that the story could happen. We like Andy Hardy who seems like everybody's nephew, son, kid brother, or next door neighbor. We know that when Judy Garland's character Betsy Booth matures a little, the two will be inseparable sweethearts. The film is a treat which allows us to see both Judy Garland and Lana Turner in early roles. Garland has a certain sweetness as Betsy Booth, Andy's next door neighbor's granddaughter. She is believable as a young innocent. While she sings a few musical numbers, this is not a musical and we see Garland's abilities as a young actress.
While the DVD release does not have as many special features as some of the other recent MGM re-releases, it doe shave an introduction to the film by Garland's biographer and also a ""Christmas card"" film from the cast that was probably aired with trailers in the 1930's.",1084060800,7,1912,4.528901734104046

""It Never Rains But It Pours"" is also really good. ""In Between,"" ""Awful In Between"" or whatever that song is called reflects somewhat on her own personal and professional quandaries close to the time of its performance.

398332,4,6301964055,"""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" is the third film in the Andy Hardy series about a Judge (Lewis Stone) and his irrepressibly manic son, Andy (Mickey Rooney). In this film young Andy gets a run for his money when the girl next door, Betsy Booth (Judy Garland) pulls cupid's arrow with sincerity and comes out the winner. This was the first film in which Garland's character appeared and perhaps, it's the best in the whole series. The hokum and corn is deep and laughable but hey, that's part of the film's charm and truly, you have to be a die hard cynic not to fall for Andy's overwhelmingly patriot schmaltz. A winner through and through.
TRANSFER: Warner gives us an impressive looking transfer with a solid B&W picture. The gray scale is nicely balanced. Age related artifacts are kept to a bare minimum. There is some minor shimmering of fine details that is distracting at times. Blacks are solid. Contrast levels are well represented. The audio is mono but nicely cleaned up for this DVD.
EXTRAS: An intro from Garland biographer, Jonathan Fricke.
BOTTOM LINE: This is a must have for collectors. One only wishes that Warner had had the foresight to release the entire Andy Hardy series as a box set. Ditto for ""The Thin Man""!",1081209600,15,1225,4.675925925925926

7818822,4,6301964055,"This was one of the first black and white films that I saw as a kid.(I'm in my 20s.) When I found it on DVD here, I had to add it to my collection and couldn't wait to see it again. Of course,you know that with the cast of Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland and Lana Turner it's going to be great. Some scenes are dated, that's for sure but overall the film has an Americana quality that may not have been an accurate depiction of it's own era but is pleasant. The elements of being respectful, responsible to earn the things that you want and adults learning from kids (the radio scene in the film) are still important today. (Or they should be.) The scenes of the jalopy and walking around town are cute. This is a charming and enjoyable film that I'm pleased to have in my collection.",1491436800,,780,4.241610738255034
