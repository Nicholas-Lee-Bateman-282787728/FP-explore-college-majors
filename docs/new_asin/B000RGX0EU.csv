2867188,4,B000RGX0EU,"House of 1,000 Corpses- I think Zombie did a really good job. I love how he puts incredible detail into it, like the scary props at Captain Spaulding's and all the HALLOWEEN decorations were awesome. Four college students named Bill, Jerry, Mary, and Denise are traveling throughout America looking at different road-side attractions, until they come to Captain Spaulding's who tells them about Dr. Satan. They become interested and run into the sadistic Firefly family, who act friendly at first, but turn to psychopaths. On HALLOWEEN, they torture them by using a razor on Bill's face, cut through Jerry's scalp, dress Denise up like a little girl, Mary's dad gets shot and his face torn off, etc. (It would be sad if this happened in real life.) Later, Denise must survive Dr. Satan's underground chamber. The climax was a little silly, but it's horror film. If you love HALLOWEEN, Zombie's movies and his style, you'll love HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES!!!

The Devil's Rejects- When I very first saw this in 2005 at the theatre, I hated it! I thought it was a piece of crap, I had not seen the original and didn't know it was going to make us side with the bad guys. In summer of 2007, I decided to give this a 2nd chance because Rob Zombie was directing a remake to my all-time favorite movie, HALLOWEEN! I like better now than when I first saw it. It starts with Sheriff John Quincy Wydell and his troopers begin a full-scale attack against the Firefly family. Only Otis and Baby make it out. Mother Firefly is caught. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding plan to meet at the Kahiki Palms Hotel. They torture and kill the members of Banjo & Sullivan, then they seek refuge at brothel owned by Captain Spaulding's brother, Charlie Altamont. Wydell turns into a vigilante and hires bounty hunters to find the Fireflys. Wydell threatens Charlie into giving up the Fireflys. Wydell then takes them back to their house and tortures them. If you love Rob Zombie's work, and have a crush on his smokin' hot wife, you'll love THE DEVIL'S REJECTS!!!",1250640000,,2037,4.705882352941177

2867190,5,B000RGX0EU,"If you already own one of the movies I would just buy the other movie. I would only recommend this set to someone who doesn't already own the movies. I fell in love when I rented these a long while back and just had to own them. I don't buy many movies but I just wanted to have this in my collection.

The case could be better, it doesn't clamp together so if you are not careful the cover will flip open when moved, but thats not a reason to not buy this.

Must have for Rob Zombie fans and just anyone who loves movies of a different kind.",1219708800,,542,3.963302752293578
2867191,5,B000RGX0EU,I was only expecting the third disc to be a short behind the scenes look but it took you through every day of filming.  I definately think it was worth the money.,1207353600,14,162,4.0625
2867192,5,B000RGX0EU,"I loved watching these movies so much I decided to buy them. But getting them in 1 package for a great price like this I could not pass it up! The box/case they are in is lame. There is no way to keep it closed. No snap thing to keep it closed. So when the box sits there it is always open. But oh well.
  Horror. Pure horror! it takes a lot to scare me. These movies didn't scare me. I must be honest. But to see the ma cob and horror of this dysfunctional family blew me away. It took a SICK mind to make these movies. Otis is one bad a@@!
  For the devils rejects I was a bit confused on some parts. Why all of a sudden Otis had a huge beard. Where did grandpa go? The new Mother Firefly ROCKED! Very sexy!
  These films kept me amused and excited to see what will happen next!
I recommend it totally!

2867193,3,B000RGX0EU,"Nothing new here: this set features Rob Zombie's first two films exactly as they were released originally, with a new cover to persuade buyers.

If you have not seen these two films, or just haven't gotten around to buying them; this is the perfect set for you.  The Devil's Rejects follows the Firefly family from House of 1,000 Corpses as they are hunted down by the brother of slain sheriff Wydell.

House of 1,000 Corpses has a small gathering of fun special features, while The Devil's Rejects boasts a large selection of extras, along with ""30 Days In Hell"" which follows the making of the film from pre-production to read-through, and beyond.  You'll feel like you were on set.

My first instinct upon seeing this new set was disappointment in Rob Zombie, who has always gone against the commercial grain.  However, I have the feeling that Lions Gate may have been more responsible for this than Mr Zombie himself so I can give him the benefit of the doubt.  Just as record labels push ""best-of"" cd's, production companies want their share as well.

Once you get past the commercialism of a repackaged version of what the fans already have at home, these are two very important horror films and I don't think any filmmaker can match movies like these as a starting point for their career.  I'm hoping that many more movies come from the mind of Rob Zombie.  Halloween comes to theaters August 31st!!!!",1187654400,19,1408,4.710204081632653

2867195,3,B000RGX0EU,"I have yet to buy this yet because frankly it's nothing new from what a fan of the films would have. Aside from maybe fancy new packaging, all that's included are the DVDs of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" in addition to the ""30 Days in Hell"" making of Rejects. The ""30 Days in Hell"" was already packaged with Rejects when it was released much earlier. I'm in love with the films, but there isn't a reason to buy this unless you don't already have them. No extra special features, nothing new. Maybe in a year or so, they'll release another one with some extra content. Til then, it's not necissary unless you really want another copy of the film.",1186185600,20,666,4.4227642276422765

Devil's Rejects is my favorite for so many reasons, you actually end up rooting for the killers, the music is awesome, and for the budget they worked with, it's just amazing how they made this a first class film.

2867238,4,B000RGX0EU,"Rob Zombie devotees will delight in this 3 disc collection, which focuses on his Capt Spaulding etal clan of socially rebellious and arguably mentally defective outcasts.  While The Devils Rejects has the true mark of Rob Zombie stamped throughout...the lack of Karen Black's revival of the Mama role, in this sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, is sorely missed.  Is there gratuitous violence...why yes, yes there is...but of course this is the hallmark of this series and a must to illustrate the degenrative level of sociopathic behavior imbred within this family.  The line between right and wrong blurs further regarding those who represent hero/saviour figures (law enforcement) who demonstrate a raw barbarism of their own when dealing with the clan.

The 3rd disc, 30 Days in Hell, is a documentary type autobiographical journal of the filming of The Devils Rejects, which allows you a peek into the mind of Rob Zombie, also his methodology and at times reasoning behind shooting scenes as he does.  This documentary features interviews with Zombie, cast and crew, make - up and wardrobe information, as well as screen tests for those who fill the roles of other than lead(s).

I have rated this collection 4 of 5 stars only because I feel the 3rd disc, while interesting, served no purpose...actually it went out of its way to explain what should have been left to the viewers imagination.",1328054400,,1395,4.991379310344827
2867239,5,B000RGX0EU,"I love these two slam bang horror-thrillers, they promise to be an assault on your senses and by golly they sure as heck don't let you down. Sid Haig is so funny, he almost steals the movie, bless him.
Great to see Karen Black back where she belongs, on screen slinking around being a temptress and Bill Moseley gave me the creeps, top notch acting from him.
You really can't fault either of these future classics as the cast is perfect and Rob's direction is very well crafted here as he drags out some very well executed scenes.
Think Texas Chainsaw Massacre notched up a few amps and you kinda know what you're in for.

2867255,5,B000RGX0EU,"This DVD set includes what are perhaps Rob Zombie's 2 most popular projects:  THE HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS.  The third disc is a ""making of"" documentary which I was disinterested in watching.

REJECTS is the sequel to CORPSES.  Bucking the traditional trend, I found REJECTS to be the far superior flick.  Of course, ""superior"" is a relative term here as both movies are pretty warped.

The films center around a dysfunctional, twisted family of murderers.  It would seem to me that Rob had inspiration from the Manson family murders of 1969 as his ""model"" for his group of sadists.  There are some obvious differences;  the Manson ""family"" was  a family in name only as it was a commune / cult.  Rob's goobers, meanwhile, are an actual family.  Also, the Mansons had a misguided political agenda, whereas Rob's goobers just like to torture & kill people - period.

The most haunting character is portrayed by Sherri Moon Zombie.  Just like the lovely young women ""recruited"" by Charles Manson, she is gorgeous and seems in some clips like an all-American girl-next-door.  That's precisely what is so terrifying about her persona;  she can seem to be normal (and perhaps flighty) but is nonetheless the embodiment of pure evil.

Ironically enough, the ultimate didactic utility of Rob Zombie movies is to teach us all to show kindness to each other.  After seeing the hideous mindset & acrimonious hatred of the characters in his movies, we relish simple courtesies from other people all the more.",1252368000,,1519,4.913385826771654
