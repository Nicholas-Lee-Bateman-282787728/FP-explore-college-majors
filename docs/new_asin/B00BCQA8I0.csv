8566408,5,B00BCQA8I0,"If you like a little Enigma, Delirium, and Pink Floyd all combined into one band Schiller seems to fulfill that. The concert from this German band is well produced and just about all of the songs were excellent with the live instruments, great crisp sound, along with the sexy sultry singers Kate, Meredith, and wow!! Anggun makes this Blu Ray a top notch purchase.  Very creative sometimes very ethereal, 5 stars !!",1466812800,,416,4.777777777777778

8566411,5,B00BCQA8I0,"Amazing concert, amazing production. My new ""reference"" for live HD recordings. Schiller's concerts are always of a special class and this bluray does not disappoint in revealing all the beautiful musical details.

The disk I received is actually Region ""0"", i.e. ""All Regions"". As long as your player can cope with PAL/50Hz it will play fine in North American players.",1446076800,3,369,5.15
8566412,5,B00BCQA8I0,"Two hours and twenty minutes of pure Schiller in a Blue-ray production DVD, 2013 Berlin Concert which is the beat entertainment I can offer anytime I have any gathering. Although I gave this DVD 5 STARS the real 5 STARS concert of Schiller is Berlin 2003 Concert, exactly ten years before this one in 2013 when he was not as well known and popular. I made sure to purchase few of that DVD since it is that good.",1398384000,6,411,4.282051282051282
