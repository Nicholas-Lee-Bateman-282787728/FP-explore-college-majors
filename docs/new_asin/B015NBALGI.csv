8734043,5,B015NBALGI,"This 3 DVD set is really a 2 DVD set, ""The Complete Review"" and a more recent DVD ""The Mind of a Poet"". If you like Cohen for more than his singing/songwriting, get the set. It is well worth it. If you want to save a buck, get The Mind of a Poet by itself. It is humors interviews and insight into the man, with many of of my favorite Cohen Quotes and many new ones. A couple interviews are through a translator but are edited  and closed captioned very well. There is also an interview in a studio that is of poor visual quality but does not take way from the material. I am 70 and only became aware of Cohen a couple years before his passing. I wish I knew him years ago. I would have loved to have seen him live. For those us who missed him live, this is a good substitute. He has give me a more reasoned & humerus view of my own mortality. His quotes and jokes have gotten me a lot of laughs. I have ""bootlegged' them.  If I new where the good jokes came from, I would go there more often. RIP L.C. and Hallelujah.

8734045,3,B015NBALGI,"If you already have the 2-part documentary LEONARD COHEN UNDER REVIEW, those two DVDs are two-thirds of this set.  While that was disappointing, the third DVD was made up of interviews with Leonard during various points in his long career.  That alone is worth the price of the entire package, although audio and video editing left something to be desired.",1482710400,13,356,4.916666666666667
