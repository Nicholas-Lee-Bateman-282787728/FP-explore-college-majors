8298289,5,B000171SGM,My son loves this and the other Crazy Craft DVDs. We got them at a grocery store. I'll admit we haven't made anything from it yet. But he's watched them enough over and over that we could probably do it without watching the show. It's very inspirational in the context of art and fun.,1454803200,,284,4.277777777777778
