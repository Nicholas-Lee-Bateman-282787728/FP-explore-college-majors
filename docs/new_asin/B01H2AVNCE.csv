7772086,1,B01H2AVNCE,"This is a scam.  As the other mentioned before, this is just the movie, no special features, no subtitles, just the movie.  Just get the dvd version by Burnie.",1470873600,10,159,4.448275862068965
7772087,1,B01H2AVNCE,"BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT BUY THE ""BLU-RAY"" VERSION OF THIS FILM!!!
First off, I'd like to say that this movie is fantastic and I highly recommend picking it up if you're a fan of comedy, Sci-Fi, or just the Rooster Teeth Crew in general.
That being said, just buy the DVD version. The Blu-Ray is a ""Print on Demand"" bootleg product that Amazon just burns onto a record-able disc.
There are NO special features, subtitle, other languages, or even a standard MENU to the Blu-Ray version, even though the packaging you'll receive will claim that these these are on the disc.
For $27, at time of purchase/review, this is a TOTAL SCAM.

Do yourself a favor, save half the price and just buy the Official DVD version instead.",1470614400,28,715,4.5859375

8764434,1,B01H2AVNCE,"Please don't buy this and waste your money like I did. Horrible movie. Bad lines, bad acting. All bad. It could have been a great funny movie. There were a few laughs but honestly, rent this before you buy it. It was done so badly. I'm a huge sci-fi fan. I'm a movie buff too. But this isn't a good movie.",1475712000,,305,4.016393442622951
8764435,4,B01H2AVNCE,"I didn't really know how to rate this.  I LOVED Lazer Team when I saw it in the theater.  The movie would have gotten a straight 5 stars.

BUT... when I bought this alleged ""Blu-Ray,""  It turned out to have:
> NO subtitles (despite them being advertised on the box)
> NO special features (despite them being advertised on the box)
>And I don't even think it was really a Blu-Ray.  I suspect that this is a bootleg DVD burned by some cheap third party out to make a quick buck.  NOT RT.

Just to be sure, I called Amazon and asked them for a replacement.  But the replacement was identical.  So I shipped mine back and ordered a regular DVD from the Rooster Teeth store, and that's what I'm advising everyone to do until this listing is removed or the mess is otherwise straightened out.

So, a 5-star movie, with a 1-star Blu-Ray",1473379200,4,829,4.324675324675325

8764440,1,B01H2AVNCE,"Buy the DVD direct from Rooster Teeth.  This appears to be a bootleg copy.  It is not blu ray, does not have subtitles or special features, and starts with a blue screen for first few minutes.  Great movie but not from this seller.",1470960000,10,231,4.325581395348837
8764441,1,B01H2AVNCE,Just wanting to make sure it is clear that this is a bootleg copy and not a real one.  There are no special features and the first screen you see is the old colored bars (below).  DO NOT BUY!  I have already returned my copy and got a refund.  Give your money to Rooster Teeth and buy a DVD from their site.,1470960000,10,307,3.903225806451613
