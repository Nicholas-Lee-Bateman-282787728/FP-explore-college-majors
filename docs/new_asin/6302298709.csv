459204,5,6302298709,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, even though very few people have ever seen it. I consider it a guilty pleasure. A garbageman named Marty who aspires to be a comedian (but isn't at all funny) develops a physical deformity that makes him a hit (but he still isn't funny). The bad jokes are bad enough that you have to laugh. And the cast includes a lot of people you know in roles that are unlike anything you've ever seen them do. For example, James Caan plays an inept doctor who sees the arm growing out of Marty's back and puts a small bandage on it. My favorite is Bill Paxton as the perpetually filthy accordion-playing garbageman sidekick named Gus who likes his women large and will eat anything. Don't watch it right after a meal...",998438400,2,754,4.392857142857143
459205,5,6302298709,"Nothing shocking in your life anymore?  Rent this film.  This movie is a must for those who think they are individuals in a highly non-individual world.  Fecal maniacs and bizarre realities make fun of all of us who believe we are not influenced by the stupidity that is pop culture.  This film disturbed me and yet kept my attention.  This film comes highly recommended. If you liked Top Gun, do not bother.",980640000,2,408,4.611111111111111
459206,5,6302298709,"I recommend this film every chance I get. Very dark, very twisted. Not at all for the squeamish, weak-stomached or anyone who helps to perpetuate the  ""need"" for the nauseatingly saccharine tripe that Hollywodd feels  it must churn out in abundance - in other words, mediochre, mainstream  ""film"".
With one of the most eclectic, well-put-together casts  I've ever seen in one film, this one delivers a bleak, seedy urban fable  unlike any other. Speaking of the cast, don't be put off by those listed in  the credits: Judd Nelson wonderfully portrays our pathetic, sweaty  ""hero"" Marty Malt; Bill Paxton gives 110% as the loathsome  sidekick Gus (this performance alone sold me as a Paxton fan forever!);  Wayne Newton (yes, straight out of Las Vegas) is perfect as greedy,  out-for-number-one talent agent Jackie Chrome; Lara Flynn Boyle makes a  great, dead-pan girlfriend for Marty; James Caan is hilarious as the  callous & horrible Dr. Scurvy; and look out for Rob Lowe's cameo as  slimy Hollywood bigwig Dirk Delta (I didn't even recognize him the first  time I saw it). I feel it's best not to give too much of the plot away. It  just needs to be seen to be believed, not to mention appreciated.
If you  appreciate ""cult"" films and love blacker-than-black humour,  please, do yourself a favour and pick this one up. It's definately a keeper  and one well worth viewing many, many times. I give it three thumbs up!",965001600,7,1420,4.821576763485477
459207,5,6302298709,"I saw this movie about 8 years ago and it still haunts me. Full of well known actors/actresses and weird camera angles, this movie has given me the creeps for years. It is almost as random and Naked Lunch and just as gross.  I love it.",959731200,2,235,4.108695652173913
459318,1,6302298709,"If it weren't for good lighting and a good camera person then this movie would be an example of how to make an all out awful movie.  The plot is slim, at best.  The script was terrible.  With the script the director was doomed to fail.  The acting [except for a few moments of uneasiness by Nelson] was sub standard.  I didn't mind Wayne Newton but he was given an awful script.
  I suppose that it should be labeled as a ""nihilist"" movie.  Basically:  The world is garbage.  People are vapid- mostly mean.  Nobody really has a chance at a future.  Life sucks and death must be better- though no mention of dying. Never is it funny, let alone, mildly amusing.
  This guy- Who's not funny- wants to become a comedian.  Only his moron friend thinks that he's funny.  As trash men [Nelson] one day  gets an infection, on his back.  The lump turns into a babies hand and grows into an am.  This freaky addition gives him an edge in the  variety show world.  Wayne Newton now wants to be his agent.  Blah blah blah,  the movie sucks.
  Get: ""The Big Lowbowski"" or ""Repo man"" [with Emilio Estevez] instead.
  There is no: ""Wow!""  or ""This movie is great!""  It's garbage and filmed in garbage.",1430956800,,1186,4.386046511627907

459326,3,6302298709,"I am not someone who likes weird films and this is definitely one of the weirdest I've ever seen. I've always been a Judd Nelson fan so I decided to give it a try. I'd seen it years ago and recently saw it the other day and it was entertaining.

This movie isn't a great film with great acting but it's quirky and it keeps you watching just to see how weird it actually gets and it gets weird!

All and all it's a fun movie and a good little film to watch if you have nothing else to do. It's not scary at all so I don't know why it's considered a comedic horror but it has its moments. What wins you over is Judd Nelson as the lead character. He's a wonderful actor who can take any role and make it his. He's never ceased to amaze me and he did a great job as Marty.

Bill Paxton was entertaining too and I enjoyed Wayne Newton.

By all means this is not an example of brilliant film cinema but it's a decent little film to check out at least once. It's one of those movies where even if you don't like it, you'll keep watching to the end.",1318204800,,1041,3.942857142857143
459327,5,6302298709,"Just read the synopsis for this movie and if it doesn't intrigue you then it may be possible your sense of wonderment has faded away. Watchable(?) for Bill Paxton's performance alone, much less the great commentary.",1282608000,,215,5.0
459390,1,6302298709,"I found this new for $3 at Big Lots, but I'm afraid it wasn't even worth that.  I don't know what kind of sense of humor you need to have to find this funny, but whatever it is it's clear I don't have it, and am no doubt better off because of it.

Perhaps writer/director Adam Rifkin fancied himself a cross between David Lynch and John Waters, but it ends up an extraordinarily lame and humorless imitation, with the worthwhile features of neither.  The movie would be full of ""droll"" surrealist or absurdist humor, if anything in it was actually the least bit funny.  The protagonist is intentionally a incredibly lousy comedian, but everything about this movie is about as funny as the complete dud jokes he tells-- I felt about the way the deadpan patrons of Sid's nightclub look at the beginning of the movie.  Painfully unfunny to the point that I couldn't even tell what was *supposed* to be funny, and that which was apparently supposed to be shocking was simply pathetic in the attempt (except the necrophilia, which was a little on the sick side for my tastes).

I can laugh at a lot, I find much humor in Lynch and Waters for instance, and can at least understand what is supposed to be funny in movies like ""Airplane,"" though I find it mostly to be an endless collection of ""groaners.""  I don't offend or shock easily, but perhaps that's the problem here.  Frankly, I couldn't even identify something worth groaning about.  And I found Bill Paxton's hyperactive screaming character mostly just annoying.  In the hopes that I would find at least SOMETHING in the movie funny I sat through it to the end, and even when the ""jokes"" were supposed have gotten better at the very end (I could tell that much at least), still found nothing redeeming.  The director's ""introduction"" extra was incredibly amateurish and lame as well.

The Q&A extra reveals that his motivation may have been to make the viewer uncomfortable and resent him for it (based on a feeling he got from a friend who did a bad standup gig), but I wouldn't say it even had that effect on me-- it didn't have the fascination of a train wreck, more like watching the paint dry on a lead balloon.

Even the surreal world that sets the stage is poorly done, with the overuse of the same droll ""Blumps"" product gags (they might as well have used, ACME), bad tv programs, an itchy & scratchy cartoon equivalent, Dr. Scurvy reminds of the dentist in Little Shop of Horrors (but far less funny), everything here has been done much better elsewhere.",1244332800,,2516,4.589285714285714
459391,3,6302298709,"The Dark Backward is a strange movie.  I remember being somewhat curious when the movie came out.  As I was a mere teenager at the time, I didn't see it then and only got bits and pieces from fellow family members.  They were dissapointed, but nonetheless took perverse pleasure in the pure insanity of the film.  It might be worthy of cult status.  That said, it's not perfect, but between Bill Paxton and Adam Rifkin, there's something sickningly genuis about the film, in spite of its flaws.

The film deals with a struggling comedian played by Nelson who is insanely bad.  Yet his ""friend,"" played by Bill Paxton cheers him on, taking a sick pleasure in it.  In the midst of all this, Nelson's character grows a third arm.  All sorts of insanity ensues.  It doesn't all work.  The thing that keeps me coming back to the movie (and at times looking away) is Bill Paxton.  His performance is profane and hilarious.  He really gets so deep into his character that it's almost perverse to watch what he does.  If the film was better received upon its release, Paxton would've garnered much praise.

But the film seems disjointed and that keeps it just short of being revisited by cult film enthusiasts.  Yet its strange nature makes it worth a watch on its own.  Perhaps the strangest thing about the film, to me (besides Wayne Newton), was the fact that Rifkin manages to craft a good moral and theme to the film in the end - something you usually don't see with such a dark comic film.  It's hard to reccommend for repeat viewings, but if you're into the bizarre, sometimes sick and twisted - this film is worth a viewing.  Whether it's worth multiple viewings is all a matter of (bad) taste.",1242691200,,1694,4.549668874172186
459392,5,6302298709,"""The Dark Backward"" goes way beyond just being a dark comedy. Kind of like watching a David Lynch film on laughing gas! Only those attracted to cult films may fully appreciate this. Those expecting a main stream comedy better steer clear.

The cast in this film is quite amazing, and not what you would expect for this kind of movie.

If you like films that are dark, grim, grimy and down right absurd, you just might want to check out ""The Dark Backward"".",1207267200,,456,4.481927710843373

The supermarket posters in the background advertised the strangest foods like ""Weaselroni"", ""Squeezable Bacon"", ""Pork Juice"", and my favorite ""Pig Newtons"". It's like ""Blue Velvet"" only more dismal and even stranger characters. It's worth it just to see teen idol Rob Lowe looking ugly as a mule's [...] in hilarious make-up.

After the second viewing I concluded my first opionion was correct. This movie is boring. The jokes are't that good, and a arm growing out of someone's back is not going to be enough to carry it. Judd Nelson and Bill Paxton are great actors and really try hard to work with what they have or I wouldn't even give it two stars. Want to watch some good unusual SciFi? Rent or buy any of the LEXX series. It is entertaining, funny, morbid, scary, sexy, and everything this movie wishes it could be.",1189036800,2,656,4.1328125
459396,5,6302298709,"Thank you so much for the upcoming DVD release!! ""The Dark Backward"" is one of the darkest, most transgressive, brilliant films of the 80s and it has a significant cult reputation. The DVD release is long overdue. I searched endlessly to find my VHS copy and ended up paying a fortune on ebay. I am soooo glad it is finally coming out.

I am an indie film maker myself and I was very influenced by the look and feel of this film, and have watched it over and over. It is beautifully textured and dense with sinister imagery and sound that really gives it an ""out there"", disturbing feel.

It makes me a bit sad, however. When a film is released to DVD it means it is becoming more a public property for every average joe who doesn't know or respect film and less ""our film"" (the secret of film buffs who have good taste). Sad, because now its greatness will be diluted and every idiot will rent it, thinking its an Adam Sandler comedy or something, and not understand or appreciate it.

It doesn't matter though, confrontation art is not meant to be understood by a mass audience.",1163635200,,1080,4.417085427135678

459398,5,6302298709,"The Dark Backward is a terrific movie in the most offbeat way. The movie takes place in the not too distant future and it is grimey and full of garbage. Judd Nelson is oily. Bill Paxton is filthy. Together they are garbage men hoping for a big break in show business. Paxton is so over the top and positive about the future that he screams it. Nothing good seems to happen to Nelson. James Caan is in this as a wacky doctor. Rob Lowe is great wearing a false nose and talking like Sammy Davis Jr. Mr. Las Vegas Wayne Newton is a main player as talent agent Jackie Chrome. All this and more in a pretty strange movie. It has found an audience and newer VHS copies can go for $80.00. Let's hope the Oct. 3, 2006 date happens. If you like odd movies try this one out. As dark as it is the movie's ending is strangely uplifting.",1158883200,2,824,4.15625
459399,4,6302298709,"The Dark Backward is one of those gleefully twisted films that will only appeal to folks with an appropriately mutated sense of humor. Its dark comedy will almost certainly not appeal to those with decidedly mainstream taste...trust me. But, if (like me) you're into v-e-r-y off-beat fare and can handle the sight seeing Bill Paxton participating in arguably the least erotically-charged threesome ever committed to celluloid (oh, my poor eyes! lol!), well...I'd imagine you'd have a blast with this little oddity...as well as want to take a shower immediately after viewing it!

That being said:

Don't buy this upcoming region 1 DVD release. I, for one, am boycotting it (despite the fact that I very much want to add it to my collection) because it's simply inexcusable - not to mention downright insulting - that this film is NOT being released in its proper aspect ratio as an anamorphic widescreen DVD.

459499,5,6302298709,"Remember the ""brat pack""?  Remember CABIN BY THE LAKE? Well....wayyyyyyy before he visited that cabin, he was well warped and deliciously off center in DARK BACKWARD.  This is a sweet tale of a unsuccessful stand-up comic/sanitation worker.  He tries and tries to get the kind of recognition he so craves.  But it never seems to come to him.  .....that is until his special ""talent"" comes to light.  He has a hand growing slowly but steadily out of his back.  It grows into a full arm.  And *poof* like magic, his career is made!  The old saying is true:  ""Everybody loves a circus freak!!""

  It is a terrific movie for those of you who like the less walked path of cinema; who think movies like FREAKED and BASKET CASE are a good way to use your extra time.  You will love it if you want to see Judd being both nerdy and dark at the same time.  And, as ol' Joe Bob Briggs used to say:  not a lot of cussin'; not a lot of breasts.  Just good old fashion perverse entertainment at the expense of a deformity!  Get a big bowl of popcorn with extra butter and salt, put your feet up, and have a great time.

459501,5,6302298709,"Whathehellever this movie is I haven't figured out yet, but I do know one thing: this is one strange freaking movie. Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton and Lara Flynn Boyle star in this bizarre piece of cinematic history, including a surprise twisted cameo by Wayne Newton. Yes, THAT Wayne Newton. How they got all these stars in this movie I will never know but hell, the more the merrier. Judd Nelson takes on the role of a greasy screwed up garbage man that harbors dreams of becoming a comedian with glee. His slicked down hairdo and nasty clothing automatically make you cringe every time you see him, that and Bill Paxton's role as his accordion playing sidekick. Bill really outdid himself in this movie as a weirdo psychopathic pudgy girl loving maniac that does nothing except act really strange and play the accordion as Judd twirls in circles during his routine. If you think that is weird then you ought to see when Nelson (as Marty Malt) discovers a bump on his back during shirtless garbage run. He goes to a doctor and all he does is put a band-aid over it. As time goes by the arm grows bigger and bigger until it eventually becomes another arm. And each time he goes to the doctor all he seems to be able to do is put another band-aid on it. Babylon 5's Claudia Christian takes a sexy comic turn as the doctor's nurse who does nothing but giggle and preen. Judd's Marty takes his routine on the road after being signed on by an agent, fittingly played by Wayne Newton with panache. It consists entirely of Nelson telling some really corny jokes and then twirling in a circle with his third arm jutting out, while Paxton's character plays a maniacal accordion and giggles like a fruitcake. Paxton's character has to be the weirdest one in this movie, he spends the entire time chasing around his hefty girlfriend and her friends, all the while he looks like the last time he bathed was probably when he was 5. I have no clue who wrote this or actually got the people to star in this but I can say one thing: if you want a movie that is really bizarre and makes no sense whatsoever then this is the movie for you. Oh, and make sure you are buzzed when you see it because otherwise it won't make sense. Not that it will if you are sober but still....",1119484800,5,2254,4.420673076923077
459502,5,6302298709,"Cult director Adam Rifkin (Never on a Tuesday, The Chase, Detroit Rock City) delivers once more. Those of you familiar with his work will undoubtedly be familiar with his oddball characters and outlandish plots. For those of you new to his work, 'The Dark Backward' is the best place to begin.
Marty Malt (Judd Nelson) is the worst stand-up comic in the entire world. He is equally terrible at his day job, a garbage collector. It seems that Marty is not destined for stardom ... until one day something strange happens that changes his life forever.
His accordian playing, garbage-collecting co-worker, Gus (Bill Paxton), notices a lump growing out of Marty's back while they are doing the rounds. This odd growth is diagnosed by the disturbingly incompetent Doctor Scurvey (James Caan) as a third arm.
What would normally be an embarrassingly freakish human deformity, turns out to be Marty's comedic calling. Before, Gus was his sole fan; now he has a mass following. Enter the slimy Dirk Delta (Rob Lowe), who offers Marty the chance of Holywood stardom. So begins a successful career in comedy ... ?
Seemingly straight out of a Ray Bradbury short tale, Rifkin's film is furnished with carnivalesque characters. You will be astounded and revolted by characters like 'the fat woman', 'the muscle man', and 'the human xylophones'. Rob Lowe is unrecognizable in his role as slick Hollywood bigwig (a role he would later reprise in 'Wayne's World' and 'Tommy Boy'). James Caan is frighteningly brilliant as Dr. Scurvey, and leading man, Judd Nelson, puts in his best performance since 'St. Elmo's Fire' and 'The Breakfast Club' (look out for Judd's oddball cameo in Rifkin's 'Never on a Tuesday').
'The Dark Backwards' is arguably Rifkin's best film, not having directed anything since to equal it. It is certainly his strangest movie since 'Never on a Tuesday'. If you are a fan of cult movie directors like David Lynch and John Waters, check this film out. If you are afraid of zombies, freaks, midgets and men with three arms I suggest you look elsewhere.

459503,5,6302298709,"The Dark Backward is a sickly twisted comedy of ridiculous and nauseatingly gross proportions that will leave you laughing until you cry and barfing up your lunch.
Judd Nelson plays Marty Malt, an extremely bad BAD stand up comedian.  Don't expect the Judd Nelson from The Breakfast Club either; as Marty he is a sweaty, Jeffrey Combs type character and plays the role very, very well.  His best friend is Gus, played expertly by Bill Paxton, a greasy and disgusting accordion player whose girlfriend Nicolette weighs over 400 pounds.
Marty and Gus work as Trash Collectors during the day, and while working Gus spies a lump on Marty's back, like a boil.  Marty goes to visit Dr. Scurvy, outlandishly played by James Caan, who puts a band-aid over it and charges Marty $200.00.
Gus manages to bring talent scout Jackie Chrome (played by Wayne Newton) in to hear Marty's routine, and Jackie walks out on it, telling Gus that Marty is the worst comedian he has ever heard.  Marty is crushed but Gus keeps his good spirits about it all.  Marty's ""lump"" grows some more, and Gus discovers he now has a hand growing out of his back, like a baby's hand.  When Marty goes to see Dr. Scurvy again, Dr. Scurvy again places a band-aid over the baby hand and accuses Marty of ""picking at it"".  Marty's waitress girlfriend, Rosarita, played by Laura Flynn Boyle, leaves him because she can't date a man with a three hands.
The hand grows into a full sized arm, and Jackie Chrome winds out taking on Marty as a client, turning him into Desi The Three Armed Wonder Comedian.  Gus joins up as a sidekick to play his accordion inbetween Marty's terrible jokes.  Watch for Rob Lowe to show up in a cameo role as Hollywood Bigwig Dirk Delta.
This is a tongue in cheek, very dark comedy with scenes of pure grossness.  The entire background of the film is seedy, filthy, and nauseating.  From the grimy offices of Dr. Scurvy to Marty's mother's apartment where he clips her toenails while she chainsmokes though on oxygen, to the trash filled streets they are supposed to be cleaning, to the seedy bars and lounges, it is plain that there is a great amount of detail focused onto the overall atmosphere of the film, setting the perfect mood for the plot.  Pay attention!
All throughout the movie we see the omnipresent Blump's, a company so encompassing that it owns the garbage company Gus and Marty work for, and also manufactures such delicacies as Liquid Bacon.  Go ahead and make the connection, I did.  Gus is the grossest imaginable character, even finding an old lunch pail in the landfill, opening it up, and eating the sandwich that was inside.  Gus will eat anything.  Also not to be missed is Marjorie Zipp and the Human Xylophone as they audition in Jackie Chrome's office.  There are some hilarious twists in the plot, and an ironic ending, and some amazingly good acting throughout from this stellar cast.
The overall filth of the atmosphere and the disgusting physical and mental attributes of the characters make for one bizarre flick.  Very funny movie, but only for those with sick and twisted funny bones.  I wish it was available on DVD.  Enjoy!",1076716800,19,3147,4.6872727272727275

They live in a bizarre world where a company named Blumps is supreme provider of all human needs i.e. food, drink, etc. though it is all chemically synthisized. This toxic existence causes Marty to grow a third arm out of his back and boosts his comedy career. With an unlikely cast such as Wayne Newton, James Caan, and Lara Flynn Boyle, not to mention the 3 women well over 300 lbs. each, that Bill Paxton has . . . with on a nightly basis.  There are midgets, freaks, losers, corpses, and Judd Nelson's chain smoking, abusive mother. If that's not enough to get your curiosity up, then go rent Love Story and leave the freaky comedies to those with a bit more sense of adventure. You should laugh, gag, cover your eyes and peek through the cracks, and stare for long stints at a time with your mouth open in dis-belief. John Waters? Ha! This is a different brand of weird...
In a good way.",1072915200,11,1401,4.286792452830189

The first time I seen it, I was sickened, appalled, and confused ... but intrigued.  The only word I could mutter afterwards was ""disturbing"".  I had to watch it a few more times afterwards.  If you really like ""different"", check this flick out.  Everytime I see a ""Blimpy's"", I think of this movie.  There was a brand name called ""blumps"" or something like that shown in the movie.",1038096000,,517,4.333333333333333
459507,1,6302298709,"Without a doubt, this was the worst film I've ever seen.  After watching this film, you will honestly wonder, ""What were their agents thinking about?""  Having seen this movie late at night, I first thought it was a bad skit, or was waiting for some sign that the entire production cast involved didn't really make this film.  Not even bad good enough to be a good ""bad"" film, the story of a three-armed comic and the manipulative agent that runs his career left me 100 minutes later asking, ""What were they thinking?""  Not camp, but some bizarre freakshow of a film without a redeeming quality.  Judd Nelson need not look farther than this project why his career peaked with ""The Breakfast Club.""  Bill Paxton and Lara Flynn-Boyle somehow survived this to go on to better opportunities (how could there be a worse one?)  Rob Lowe wisely disguised himself for a brief cameo.  With every real star that appeared in this movie, it made me think that they really need to start reading these scripts before they agree to them.  At least, I pray they didn't read it beforehand!",1030752000,5,1071,4.654255319148936

Even worse, it's the premise behind 100 minutes of my life that I'm never going to get back.

Over the top acting makes this a truly great little film. Reminds me of Eraserhead and Troma type films.
