8047916,5,B0007L7XZ2,"This abs routine was included as a bonus on a DVD set that I purchased (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beachbody-Turbo-Jam-5-Workouts-Dvd/dp/B00H13JKWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beachbody Turbo Jam (5 Workouts Dvd)</a>).  It is a short but tough 8-minute abs routine led by Beachbody instructor Tony Horton.  Horton is on a beach with two background exercisers (one is fellow Beachbody instructor Debbie Siebers; the other I believe is named Sandy).  He explains that the workout consists of a total of seven exercises which are performed for 30 seconds each (there is a countdown timer on screen) and then repeated for a second round.

The seven exercises are as follows:  1) hip rocks, 2) leg lifts, 3) bicycles, 4) isolation holds to center, 5) isolation holds to left, 6) isolation holds to right, and 7) full-body crunches.  The order of the exercises is based on the theory of ""sectional progression,"" or working all muscles of the abdominals, moving from bottom to top (there is also a graphic on screen to illustrate this).

Sandy modifies some of the moves; I've found that I need to modify a bit further so as not to strain my back.  Otherwise, this is an excellent routine that can be used daily, as the abs one muscle group that doesn't require an off day for rest.  I'm not sure if purchasing this routine on its own makes sense, but as part of another DVD, it's definitely a great buy.",1406937600,,1439,5.115384615384615
8047917,5,B0007L7XZ2,"This is a great workout for lower abs.  In one week, doing the tape everyday, I could see my stomach looks smaller and more toned.  Can't wait to see the results in 30 days!!  I had this tape years ago in VHS and loved it so when I found it in DVD, I just had to have it as I know the sectional progression system they use works.  This is a must have dvd.  It's 7 minutes.  Each exercise is 30 seconds.  It is hard at first but after a week or so, you will get better as the tape gets easier.  I highly recommend this tape.",1371427200,,523,3.822429906542056
8047918,5,B0007L7XZ2,"I have owned Great Abs Guaranteed for about 11 years now, I think.  Embarassingly enough, I have it on VHS ;) and I still use it to this day!  I'm just waiting for the day for my tape to go out but it keeps on going, amazingly enough.  This routine is great because each exercise is 30 seconds each, then it repeats.  When done often and regularly it will become ""easy"".  I even add more sets and do on my own sometimes when I'm feeling strong.  If you do this 3-4 times a week along with other cardio (say treadmill on the same days), you are guaranteed to have strong, defined abs- you should even be able to see your muscles.  So, even after a decade of doing this ab routine, I would still recommend it.  Can't go wrong!",1323129600,2,724,4.158273381294964

This video is quick and if done everyday or even every other w/ a good diet, you will see results quickly!  It is worth 7 min. a day.  The first few times you do it it is a little hard, but they gets easier.  Wonderful!  I have been using it for the past 7 yrs!",1243209600,3,360,3.6842105263157894
