It is masterfully filmed and communicates essential biblical truths in a memorable and applicable way.
High schools, youth groups, and churches should take a look at this resource, as should any Christian seeking to bring God's peace to a world that desperately needs restoration.",1468454400,5,395,5.387096774193548
7802190,5,1942503040,"Wow! This whole series is amazing!! Practical down-to-earth encouragement...  on how to live in the world but not of it... We are not just saved so that we can go to heaven someday or have a relationship with Jesus in this lifetime. This world is not our home... But we don't just hold our breath until it's over! He has made us exiles in this worl, to be His hands and feet.  Great video, and there is a real hipster coolness to it... So that young people could see it, and really embrace the message of life change! I just ordered another DVD --and loaning this one to my Pastor and Youth pastor to view.",1446768000,7,606,4.260869565217392
