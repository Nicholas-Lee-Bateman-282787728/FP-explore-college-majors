It doesn't look good, especially for America, because our whole economy and our whole way of living is based on oil.  The watchers of this film are asked to think critically about what happened on 9-11.  My favorite quote in the whole film is: ""If people don't know what's going on, there is no democracy.""

I remember hearing somewhere else that our corporations, government and military is based on a pyramid structure.  It was possible for 100+ people to be involved in the Manhattan Project and not one of them to know they were making the atomic bomb because each person had only a piece of the intricate puzzle; no one had the full picture.  I feel like Americans are being distracted with TV, iPhones, iPads and the latest Kim Kardashian craze to keep out of the loop.  This documentary presents another take on 9-11, a perspective that mainstream media has not discussed, a perspective that may surprise you about what has been fought in the name of democracy, in the name of America (no wonder the world hates us), in the name of you, and in the name of me.

I read somewhere that solar power was prolific in some villages as far back as 2000.  Why is America so slow to convert?  Shouldn't we all have solar power now due to the coming peak consumption?  Shouldn't we all be gearing up trying to switch to other alternatives instead of trying to utilize dangerous fracked oil, so why aren't we?  Why aren't we using more solar, more vegetable oil, etc..  This film details the coming economic crisis, but it's up to individuals to act on this information responsibly.  Another website suggests: buying locally, taking public transportation/walking/biking, sustaining a vegetarian lifestyle and more.

8267623,5,B0017W6HO8,"Absolutely fascinating documentary. Puts a whole new face on the 9/11 tragedy: what and who really caused it? Is the American public being told the truth?
And why is ""peak oil"" not talked about by politicians and what was it's effect on 9/11? Every American should watch this documentary and decide for him or herself.",1266883200,2,318,4.8

Most Americans, right, center and left, remain on the sidelines applauding the emperor's new clothes or otherwise ignoring voices of reason, even those as eloquent and research-based as those who speak in this 47 minutes summary of where we are and where we are headed if we do not awaken from our hypnotic denial.

  As you watch this, pay close attention to the predictions about economic situations as the one we are in now and how it is also predicted that no one will make the connection. Few people will think that peak oil is largely responsible for the current ""bail out"" crises because few will want to know how difficult it will be for any president, even Obama, to pull us out without facing the truth about 9/11, the so-called war on terror and the looming energy crises. Many of us have been writing about all of this in many books, chapters and articles, but here is a very engaging and articular synthesis in less than an hour that brings it all home.
  Watching this may be the first step in breaking the denial that has kept us from holding Bush and Cheney accountable and even keeps such wonderful champions of truth as Amy Goodman, Noam Chomsky, Thom Hartman and others from truly engaging these topics as they should be engaged.
