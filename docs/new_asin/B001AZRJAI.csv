8280700,4,B001AZRJAI,"This is one of a group of movies by director J.P. Allen. In it a male fan approaches a successful female author in a coffee shop. Something she wrote touched him and he's written a story in response that he wants her to read. The movie follows the back and forth between the two. What's the purpose of a story? Is it to get published in magazines, make you rich and famous, or simply to touch the heart of one person? Based on the strength of this one I rented all of J.P. Allen's films.",1353542400,,487,4.136842105263158
8280701,4,B001AZRJAI,"""Coffee and Language"" is a small, focused and well-done ""think piece"" about writing, talking, communications and how we relate to each other. Oh, and it also takes place almost entirely in a coffee shop. In fact it's mostly in black and white (flashbacks and stories people tell to each other are shot in color).  It reminds one of Jarmusch's ""Coffee and Cigarettes.""

This is a much better movie, although it's also episodic and disjointed in a way. The focus is on a writer and a man who has been so moved by her novel to write stories just for her (an audience of one), to try to communicate his essence to her - he can't find the words to say out loud. This turns into a discussion of how we read, and whether or not we can ""know"" a writer by his work alone.

How autobiographical is any fiction?

Around this framework, the film also tells a couple of stories of other people in the coffee shop, and how they relate, use words, and read fiction, stories, etc. The sum is greater than its parts. ""Coffee and Language"" is clearly and aggressively a writer's rhetorical discussion about creation, and how your words affect the world.

It's also funny, and casually deep. It touches on subjects we rarely see in a film (indie or not). How do we relate to a story? To words that move us? Even if they are not intended in that way. JP Allen, the writer and director, has managed to make these potentially academic topics into a dramatic, entertaining, modest but engaging work that's head and shoulders above most slacker-coffee-shop indie films. (Is that a genre?)",1215561600,,1564,4.571428571428571
