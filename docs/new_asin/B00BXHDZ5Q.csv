5680562,3,B00BXHDZ5Q,"Strange things are happening in San Antonio. Members of rival drug cartels are turning up dead with every drop of blood siphoned from their bodies. When DEA Agent Carlos Seguin investigates, he discovers that the murder suspect isn't human. Now, he must prepare for the true last stand at the Alamo...against a rampaging pack of blood-sucking Chupacabras.

I must admit, when I heard that Erik Estrada(of TV's CHIPS) was in this film, I thought to myself that the film might not be too bad. Heck, most of the films I've seen Estrada in have always been pretty good. Don't get me wrong, the film itself isn't too bad. At times, it does take itself way too seriously. What made it an okay film instead of a film that I like is this...if you're going to make a good Chupacabra film, why not make them- at least- look halfway threatenng. The CGI Chupacabras, for the most part, were effective enough yet there were times (especially with the smaller Chupacabras) where they looked like oversized hairless Chihuahuas. I often giggled when I seen the smaller ones.

Like I say in alot of my reviews, >for what it is & what it's worth<, Chupacabra vs. The Alamo isn't a bad film at all. For me, though, the film was okay. It's cool to see ol' Poncherello(Estrada's character on CHIPS) back in action yet again. Do I recommend it as a purchase? Only if you can find it in a DVD bargain bin or as part of Horror Film Collection DVD. Redbox rental? Of course...good film for a lazy Friday night at home.",1374019200,4,1493,4.5464684014869885
5680563,3,B00BXHDZ5Q,"A cheesy movie with a cheesy premise.  Aside from the fact the legends (I've never seen a scrap of evidence indicating chupacabras are anything but fairy tales) don't talk about the chupacabras as either a type of canine or as man-killers (there's a reason they call them goat suckers, not human suckers), and the fact rabid animals do not pack up or become insanely hungry (as the disease advances they become unable to feed and calling them anti-social is an understatement), and the fact the chupacabra myths don't have them running in packs, the movie had plenty wrong with it.  A cop tries to take a picture of the animal he knows just killed his dog instead of shooting it?  A well-trained, well-equipped, well-armed swat team who sees the animals coming after them being wiped out faster than a smaller, much less capable group of street hoods taken by surprise?  A street punk carrying enough explosives to destroy the Alamo?  Muzzle-loading firearms with a rate of fire a modern semi-automatic would have trouble matching?  Please.
Now for the guilty pleasure part.  If you like cheesy monster movies (I do) and are able to suspend belief while you watch them (I can) this isn't a bad movie.  It's by no means a good one, but if you have nothing better to do for an hour and a half it's not unwatchable.  It's a stupid movie, but I enjoyed it.",1374019200,2,1352,4.647058823529412

5680565,2,B00BXHDZ5Q,"Carlos Seguin (Erik Estrada) and his new partner Tracy (Julia Benson) are investigating a murder. Erik believes it is some kind of gang killing while Tracy opts for CG canines. If you read the title of the film, you already know it is the CG canines known as Chupacabra, which look like a big ugly coyote. Carlos has family issues which become part of the film as they try to iron out their problems.

The special effects make for a campy film. The CG animals, CG gun fire, and the scenery moving in the background as Erik rides his bike, like a 1940's film. His jumping over a car and the use of a CG grenade was perhaps the highlights of the campy humor. The dialouge was fairly lame with noticeable music and scene changes for commercial breaks.

There is plenty of fake blood and killing as these animals who have lived in the wild have mastered door knob operations with their first attempt. Unless you are a fan of bad SyFy films, stay away.

5680568,3,B00BXHDZ5Q,"Chupacabra vs. The Alamo is the worst chupacabra movie I've seen. Actually, that isn't fair since it's only the second chupacabra movie I've seen. The other one was Chupacabra Terror, or as it's called on the SyFy Channel ""Chupacabra: The Dark Seas"". That movie had a man in a suit. This one, which premiered on the SyFy Channel tonight, has really bad CGI. The chupacabra's look more like small dogs. The couldn't really invoke fear in anyone. That is the biggest problem with the movie. The other problem, is that there should have been a lot more humor. This is a cheesy, cheap b-movie, but it takes itself seriously more often than not. However, there is a reason why I'm giving Chupacabra vs. The Alamo three stars, and that reason is Erik Estrada. He is great in this movie, playing a cool sarcastic badass. He's far more entertaining than the chihuahua's. Oops, I mean the chupacabra's.",1363996800,6,893,4.730769230769231

What a big time let down! I though, I was going to corner the market in Chupacbra safari tours.
Alright, this movie is a lie about Chupacbras in and around the Alamo; none the less, it is one kick ass movie of a good time! Everyone in San Antonio should see this movie; and all Texans should love this movie for how far fetched it is.

5680582,3,B00BXHDZ5Q,"As monster flicks go, this one doesn't.  For pity sake, these CG critters look like feral Chihuahuas floating just above the ground (shadows notwithstanding).  The teeny-weeny ones look and sound like squeaky toys for the larger versions.  I kept thinking, these poor mutts are just misunderstood puppies with a touch of rabies.  How could they be so mean to them?  But I could well understand why they had a BIG grudge with Erik Estrada, to the point where they track down his daughter and go after her.  From that point on, it gets personal.
As far as the plot goes, no surprise, Erik Estrada's character (DEA agent Carlos Seguin) rides a motorcycle and has family issues.  SyFy flicks all feature family DRAMA.  If parents aren't divorced, separated, or one of them seriously dead, they don't know how to proceed.  There has to be CONFLICT (as though monsters and natural disasters aren't enough).  This is just more along the same lines.  Speaking of dialog..........dreadful.  Acting?  Also dreadful, consistently so.  This is a bad movie that doesn't aspire to be anything else (but on a strange level, is still entertaining enough because it is so inept it's funny).

Best moment, trying to find a supposedly, heretofore unknown SECRET escape tunnel under the Alamo........that opens in a parking lot.  Like they wouldn't have noticed the BIG double doors at some point and thought to themselves, gee, I wonder where this leads.",1415059200,,1435,4.966386554621849
5680583,3,B00BXHDZ5Q,"Honestly this one as far as low budget films....its something I would expect MS3TK or Rifftrax to get their hands on and make it better. The ""Chupacabras"" are not animated well but enough for a good laugh. There are sequences of Erik Estrada ""riding"" a motor cycle that is the most OBVIOUS green screen ive seen in a long long time. I honestly laughed out loud, but im glad I picked it up for my collection.

My best suggestion is if you really like low budget CRAPPY monster movies that are just to kill time or make fun of with your friends then go ahead and pick this one up!

5680593,3,B00BXHDZ5Q,"First things first: why are you watching this? If you want to see a well-crafted horror movie I trust you know not to consider a SyFy production starring Erik Estrada and a bunch of mangy CGI dogs. If you want to see Erik hamming it up as Texas lawman Carlos Seguin, fighting vicious mythical beasts and dealing with trite family problems, this is an excellent choice. Bonus points for putting Estrada on a motorcycle (the green screen work is brilliant!)

The film has a backstory about rival drug gangs, the loss of Estrada's wife (and, of course the new flame in his life,) his gangster son, and chupacabra-infested home and his daughter's trauma at the claws of same. While the Estrada bike footage will definitely get you laughing, understand he is the best actor in the film; I had never heard of his costar Julia Benson, but for me the prize for scenery chewing here goes to Matthew Harrison as Dr. Michael Fielding the creepy medical examiner. This is overacting of the highest magnitude; too bad his role was so small.

The chupacabra traverse drug tunnels from Mexico into San Antonio on Cinco de Mayo, with an illicit high school party being an early target, personally touching Estrada for reasons that will be obvious. Estrada wants to shut down the town before the big holiday (hmm...haven't I seen that somewhere before?) but the dogs overrun the town quickly. While Estrada is busy jumping his motorcycle (!) brave teen defenders alternately take on the chupacabras with electric carving knives and microwaves (in my experience it's a small chupacabra that can fit in a compact microwave, but then again I don't work for SyFy.) For complex reasons the humans make their last stand in the Alamo when cops and criminals cooperate to end the pestilence, finding it necessary to blow up the landmark in the process. (Don't ask.) Besides the bike riding and jumping, Estrada gets all the choice scenes here (e.g. beheading a chupacabra with a sabre, etc.) and while the special effects are awful, at least they're better than the tearjerker of a closing scene. (It's not often that chupacabras can bring a family together.)

If you want to laugh and to not be scared in any way for an hour and a half ""Chupacabra vs. The Alamo"" is a great means to that end.",1386806400,2,2268,4.736708860759494

8575060,4,B00BXHDZ5Q,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2013 and directed by Terry Ingram, the curiously titled Chupacabra vs. the Alamo details events in the San Antonio, TX, area when DEA agents (Erik Estrada, Julia Benson & Vanesa Tomasino) team-up with Hispanic outlaws in order to wipeout packs of rabid chupacabras. Jorge Vargas plays the estranged gang-oriented son of the head DEA agent (Estrada).

Chupacabra is a Spanish word, which literally means goat-sucker (from chupar ""to suck"" and cabra ""goat). There are two varieties of the cryptozoological beast: (1.) a reptile-like creature with leathery/scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back; and (2.) a hairless form of canine with a pronounced spinal ridge and prominent eye sockets, fangs, and claws. This movie features the second version.

This is basically Hispanic TV horror with CGI chupacabras getting wiped out en masse. The movie starts serious, but becomes increasingly humorous as it moves along, particularly the second half. The first half is more engaging due to the human interest, which segues into the dynamic, but less interesting second half where theres an explosive (Surprise!) showdown at the Alamo.

Estrada is in perfect shape at 63 years-of-age during filming (looking almost 20 years younger) and is stalwart as the hero. Benson is reminiscent of Sean Young when she was younger and has a marvel-inducing face & full head of brunette hair, but she needs to gain like 15-20 lbs. Nicole Muoz & Anja Savcic as the Estrada characters daughter and her bestie are cute. Tomasino is adorable in her own unique way as well.

THE MOVIE RUNS 88 minutes and was shot in San Antonio, Texas. WRITERS: Peter Sullivan & Jeffrey Schenck.

It was fun to watch Erik E in this role, as all I really know him from is CHiPS, a B-hole Surfers video, and these awful real estate infomercials he did many years ago. I guess you could say he has range. CVTA is pretty bad: overuse of very obvious greenscreen, campy, and the CGI chupacabras actually look more cute than menacing. Erik's partner is supposed to be appreciated for her multiple degrees and job skills and not good looks, but interestingly they cast a woman with like F breasts who popped straight out of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. It's a really obvious attempt at feminism that actually sets feminism back. In one early scene, Erik inexplicably has water all over his ubiquitous leather jacket (for no apparent reason) that's in every scene, and after a scene cut, his jacket is miraculously dry. Erik's house address is 999 -- 666 upside-down. The latter half of the movie does the ol' low budget trick of being set in one location: the Alamo, where, predictably, the big standoff between humanity and chupacabra takes place. All in all, this is a combo of an afterschool special mixed with a cheesy horror movie, some Latino culture, and really bad CGI.
