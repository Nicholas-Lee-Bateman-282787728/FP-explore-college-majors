(http://www.teach12.com).]

Goldman is well organized and enthusiastic.  His enthusiasm helped make this series of
lectures more interesting and entertaining for me.  That's a terrific advantage, because a
set of lectures that covers the amount of materials and details that this one does could
have been deadly boring.  He also has a very clear speaking style that helped me follow
his descriptions and explanations, even on very difficult and complex subjects, and
science during the 20th century has gotten extremely complex.  But, it is not just his
clear enunciation that helps; he repeatedly explains complex subjects in terms and
concepts that help make them understandable.

Goldman has at least two side goals: (1) to show commonalities between the different
sciences, in terms of how approaches in one scientific field were picked up, used, and
extended in another; and (2) to show the significance of specific scientific advances,
both how a specific idea or development influenced and helped further, future developments
in that same field and how a particular development in a scientific field enabled
significant advances in technology and its influence on society.

""Science in the 20th Century"" is a survey of science from 50,000 feet.  In a set of 36
lectures, roughly 30 minutes each, there is no way to cover more than important ideas with
a few supporting details.  To have tried to do so would have been confusing and impossible
to understand or remember.  Having said that, these lectures give you most of the
important developments in science in a way that is understandable and present them in ways
that help you understand why each development was important.  This is *not* just a
collection of scientific facts and theories.  ""Science in the 20th Century"" helps us
understand *how* science proceeds and what advances (e.g. in the technologies of research
equipment) enabled a particular science to proceed the way it did.

And yet, despite the fact that it is a broad survey, you will never get the feeling that
you are being told the simple and the obvious.  Goldman keeps you engaged by helping you
to see that each scientific development was an exciting breakthrough in its time *and*
giving you some appreciation for how it was important for the future of that scientific
field and what it's consequences and significance for technology or society were.

You will also get some idea of how science (the doing of scientific research) has changed
over the last 100 years.  It is increasingly collaborative, and being done by teams of
scientists or by scientists who share their work and results.  And, it is increasingly
being done by public or governmental funding; in the U.S., in particular, this funding is
often channeled through university research departments, to the extent that some argue
that the really purpose of the universities, teaching and education, is being slighted.

Give professor Goldman a chance and he is likely to make *you* a science enthusiast, too.
Then you are just a few steps from the edge of the slippery slope toward a subscription to
""Scientific American"" magazine and ...",1427241600,2,3222,5.058601134215501
7796553,5,1565858921,"The idea of a college course with ""breadth and depth"" is often used in a description.  With this presentation, however, the lectures cover a vast range of topics and are delivered with a steady stream of insights.  The professor, Steven Goldman, is seemingly able to present an entire half hour dense material from memory.  He is rarely seen using notes or a teleprompter and but instead relies on a large knowledge base and decades of experience.  For example, Prof. Goldman precisely traces the progress of state funded R&D from 19th century Germany to Vannevar Bush's plan in ""Science:  The Endless Frontier.""  I am equally impressed with his other more historical (i.e. Renaissance period) DVDs, also available under the Great Courses brand.  This is the third Prof. Steven Goldman science lecture series I've seen.  While expensive when new, Amazon or library options are good.  These videos are an exemplary case of why ""Great Courses"" is right when it claims to have some of the best college lecturers on film.",1400025600,,1017,5.005952380952381
