458144,5,6302360951,"Harder They Fall is Humphrey Bogart's last performance on the silver screen before he passed away in 1957.  He plays the character Eddie Willis, a former sportswriter, who is hired by Nick Benko (Rod Steiger), a shady boxing manager, to promote an incompetent giant boxer by the name Toro.  In the process of promoting Toro, Eddie faces several humorous situations where he has to make the wrong moral choice in order to reach his goal of making a lot of money.  Eddie's greed causes him to lose friendships, lie, and hurt people; however, he convinces himself that he must do this in order to achieve wealth.  The process of learning the value of human life and money is an emotionally painful journey for Eddie, since he becomes burdened with the heavy feelings of guilt.  Harder They Fall is an interesting film about greed and betrayal that is set in the boxing world.  As the story unfolds the audience is offered high class drama that is carried by a well prepared cast, which offers a first-rate cinematic experience.",1073001600,3,1024,4.757062146892656
458145,4,6302360951,"This is far from one of Bogart's best movies, but it is still well worth watching.  In this film, he plays a washed-up sportswriter who has been hired as a PR man for gigantic South American boxer named Toro Morena. The problem is, Morena, despite his immense size, can't box at all. Bogart and Morena's crooked owner, magnificently played by Rod Steiger, manage to take him up the heavyweight ranks by fixing a string of fights.
Of all the sports, none have inspired as many excellent films as boxing. In fact, there may be more first-rate boxing films than first rate films from all other sports combined. There are probably a good dozen very, very good fight films, and this belongs to their number.
The tension in the film derives from the ultimate conflict between Bogart's inherent decency and Steiger's unmitigated exploitativeness. The two had great onscreen chemistry in their scenes together. They employed very different acting styles, Steiger being one of the first Method actors to enjoy success in the movies. Bogart was strictly old school, but he not only held his own, he dominated their scenes together.
A couple of real life boxers played major roles in the film. Jersey Joe Alcott plays Toro Moreno's trainer. Toro Moreno himself was very loosely based on the career of Primo Canera (with the difference that Canera actually could box, the similarities being that he was a remarkably tall heavyweight who killed a man in the ring). Max Baer, former heavyweight champion and the father of Max Baer Jr. (Jethro on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES), plays heavyweight champion Buddy Brannen. The irony in this is that Baer in real life became heavyweight champion by beating Primo Canera. The in-the-ring shots are among the finest that have ever been filmed in boxing pictures.",1026604800,28,1786,4.953333333333333
458146,4,6302360951,"Humphrey Bogart stars as a former newspaper columnist who partners up with crooked fight manager/promoter Rod Steiger to act as a P.R. man for a South American fighter.  ""Toro"" has impressive size, but little else going for him, and all of his fights have to be fixed for him to win.  Bogart's wife Jan Sterling puts pressure on him to get out of the crooked business, and Bogart's own conscience weighs heavily on him.  The Harder They Fall is not a glamourous look at the sport of boxing.  It's tough and (pardon the pun) pulls no punches as it exposes the racket behind the sport.  I was surprised by how tough the approach was, although I found the ending to be a bit of a letdown and not matching the rest of the film.  Bogart is appropriately cynical and world weary, while Steiger shines in his performance as the man manipulating all.  This film isn't going to leave you with a positive impression of sports promotion, but you will be impressed by its honest, realistic depiction of the game in and out of the ring.  It makes you wonder if things have changed at all in the last fifty years.",995587200,,1099,4.46
458147,3,6302360951,"In On The Waterfront writer Budd Schulberg exposed the racketeers in NYC harbor unions. This time around it's the racketeers and crooked managers in boxing, assisted by hiring Champion director Mark Robson for the boxing scenes. Perhaps this was controversial in 1956 but by now corruption is practically derigueur. The fact that the boxer being promoted by Rod Steiger is a ""bum"" ie a poor athlete and that all his fights are fixed as evidence of sport as showbusiness, is something Humphrey Bogart is aware of when he agrees to act as the boxer's press agent. When Schulberg's self-righteousness climaxes and Bogart thinks he can overcome life threats by the power of the written word, we know we're in a literary fantasy. It also doesn't help Bogart's position that he looks tired and ill, this being his last film. Or that Jan Sterling is cast as his wife when the only thing worth noting about her is how she can look 18 in one shot and 80 in the next. Steiger's method steamroll flattens Bogart's weary cynicism here and he easily steals the film, aided by Nehemiah Persoff as the book-keeper. Steiger actually recalls his Harry Cohn-like studio head from The Big Knife, doubly ironic since this is a Columbia film. And one can read his manipulation of the boxer as the way Cohn manipulated his star, Rita Hayworth, then discarded her. Robson overlights scenes, and pays homage to TV, as if acquiescing to the battle Hollywood waged against it's competitor. Of note is the use of the song ""Blue Pacific Blues"" from Miss Sadie Thompson in a party scene.",970185600,7,1558,4.774074074074074

458187,4,6302360951,"More famously known now as Humphrey Bogart's last film, 'The Harder They Fall' really should be known for Budd Schulberg's fascinating expose on the boxing world; a world that really has not changed much from 1956.  Although boxing now in 2015 is as popular as it once was, you feel that this film portrays not only the boxing world, but any major U.S. sport in the right light.  Players are used until their full potential is used and then tossed away because there is always busloads of people to take their place willingly and cheaply.  Bogart's character is right in the middle of the muck but hey, he's Humphrey Bogart so we know he's an okay guy stuck in a middle of a tank of sharks.  The alpha shark, played with the great (in sometimes an over-the-top way) method actor, Rod Steiger.  I, for one, can't get enough of Mr. Steiger - sometimes watching him act is like watching a hurricane located on a small set.  There's something enjoyable to me about that.  This film fits right in the middle of two undisputed classics written by Schulberg: 'On The Waterfront' and 'A Face In The Crowd' and it holds its own, mostly due to Bogart's performance.  Why Budd Schulberg would ultimately fade away from Hollywood is a mystery, his feel for social message movies would have fit perfectly in later years and the cynicism still has that great bittersweet taste.",1445212800,,1363,4.65

458251,5,6302360951,"In Bogart's last film, he plays, Eddie Willis, a reputable sports writer who has been out of a job ever since his newspaper folded.  Finding himself looking for other work, he is suddenly summoned by Nick Benko, played by the always edgy and ever wonderful, Rod Steiger.  Benko has found a veritable mountain of a man in Argentina he brings to America with the idea of parlaying him into a boxer who will work his way up the roster of contenders, get a shot at the heavyweight title and a chance for a huge pay-day, win or lose!  ""Toro"" Moreno, played by Mike Lane, who stands 6'8"" and weighs in at 275 pounds in real life, is a formidable looking man!  He towers over any opponent he has ever faced but cannot box!  He's got a glass chin, a soft stomach, knows nothing of real training or footwork and doesn't pack a punch either!  Benko is using Eddie and his reputation as an honest journalist, to build Toro into the most feared fighter since Rocky Marciano while he pays off fighters to take a dive on the way up the ladder!  A couple of great fighters from the prior era are on hand to lend credibility to the film as well.  Max Baer is cast as Buddy Brannen, the Heavyweight Champion Toro is destined to fight, and Jersey Joe Walcott, who plays Toro's sparring partner.  In the film we actually see the aging Baer fight Toro in this thinly disguised film which parallels the real Baer-Carnera debacle of 1934!  Even Eddie Willis is based on the career of  sports writer/promoter, Harold Conrad!  In his last bout before the title fight, Toro's opponent dies as a result. Thinking he has killed him, Toro wants no further part of the ring and wishes to return to South America.  Benko is beyond angry upon hearing this news and convinces Eddie, the only person Toro really trusts, to talk him into staying by dangling the BIG pay day in front of his nose!  Eddie has become increasingly plagued by pangs of conscience when it comes to Toro.  He has come to realize Toro is NEVER going to receive the money promised him!  When Brannen finds out the fighter died, he knows it was at his hands the boxer received the worst blows of his career and it is he that is responsible for his death and not Toro.  Brannen is livid when he realizes Toro is receiving the credit for the kill, thereby setting him up to be billed as a great and dangerous fighter.  Brannen knows better, begins to see himself as far from finished as a fighter, and swears to take him apart in the ring.  Doing that means he has to renege on his own pay-off to take a dive in this, what was to be the last fight of his own career!  I'm not going to ruin the last of it for you so do yourself a favor and buy it to discover just how it all goes down from here.  You do have more surprises coming and remember, it IS one of the better fight films... and it IS Bogey's last one...You won't be sorry!",1420588800,3,2869,4.315298507462686

An out-of-work reporter is hired to write up a new boxer from Argentina. He is big but has faults. The promoter will rig the fight so this boxer wins. Eddie suggests California, theyll appreciate a novelty act. Strong as a bull and green as a cucumber. We see how public relations are used to manipulate newspaper reports and the public who reads and believes their stories. [But you knew this.] Will Sailor Ragazzo follow his orders? We see how the fight is fixed! [Watch what the trainer does.] Toro wins! Will there be an investigation? Can Eddie fix the press? He wants a written contract and 10% if he succeeds. Promoters buy advertising to get favorable notices in the newspapers. [Doesnt this still go on with movie ads and movie reviewers?] An old boxer is interviewed for a TV show; he has seen better times. They go to Las Vegas [legal gambling].

Managers of boxers talk about business. Ed bargains. Our hearts are in the right place. There are more boxing bouts. There is talk about a charitable donation to help a crippled childrens fund. [Note the suits worn by men in the audience.] A fight is televised. Mrs. Willis wants to visit her husband on the West Coast. Ed calls her with news about his schedule. The Chief doesnt want to take a dive; his family is watching. Ed suggests a solution; it works. They travel to Chicago for another fight. Will it be fixed? They talk to Gus; is he punched out? Eds wife meets him. Toros manager is troubling, he will be sent home with $5,000. But there is a problem with Toro. Help me! Eddie explains things to Toro, who believes him. Will they make the fight look good? The fans have got to get their moneys worth. Gus is punched and falls to the floor! They bring in a stretcher for Gus. The crowd boos the results and the fallen boxer. Gus is in a coma. Was this from the last fight? Will Gus die on the operating table?

Ed wants to stay on for the big score in New York. The publicity will be good for the gate. The boxers sign their contracts. Brennan complains about the deal, he won't carry Toro for six rounds. Benko will bet against his own boxer! We see views of New York in the mid-1950s. Toro visits a priest, Toros mother sent him a letter to come back home because of Gus death. Benko pleads with Toto to stay. Can Ed convince Toro to stay and fight? Ed tries to convince Toro by using an example. The championship fight starts. Toro is no match for Brennan! Why did he take that beating? Toros contract is sold to another manager. The accountant explains where the money went. After expenses are paid out, Toro will get $49! Eddie gets $26,000 in cash. Thats a lot of money. Moreno gets on a Pan American Airways flight for home. What will Eddie do now? Benko arrives to ask for his money back. Eddie is threatened by Nick. What is his future? Eddie begins typing his story.

Was this movie very popular? Did it rob people of their illusions about a popular sport? Newspapers and television carried a lot of boxing news in the 1950s. Was this movie based on a true story? You can look at todays newspapers to see what product is being pushed. Movies that advertised in newspapers could usually expect favorable reviews to attract an audience (in most cases). The editor of a newspaper would play the news to please the owner. You can tell the owners politics by its news coverage. [The Patterson-Johanssen bouts from 1958 were a good example of fights whose publicity didn't match the actual results.]",1389830400,,3503,4.4945054945054945

458289,5,6302360951,"Marking the end of Humphrey Bogart's career (he died nine months after the film was released), `The Harder They Fall' may just be the best performance of his career.  Sadly, some of his character's most effective mannerisms and facial expressions were more a result of his physical condition, but it helped form a fully fleshed out character that pulls at you from the very beginning until the end.

`The Harder They Fall' tells the morality tale of a sports journalist hired by a corrupt fight promoter to build up his new fighter, an import named Toro who can't fight but has the presence of a fighter.  With Nick, the promoter, paying Toro's way to the top and Eddie, the journalist, spinning a web of lies to keep the audience interested, Toro finds himself getting swept up in circumstance and facing a deathtrap.  When the lies and money catch up with them, Toro is fighting for the Heavyweight Championship against an opponent intent on KILLING him in the ring.  Nick, only concerned with the money to made, could care less, but Eddie is stricken with conscience and finds himself battling his own better interests.

Humphrey Bogart is brilliant here, layering Eddie with so much internal guilt, and his final confrontation with Steiger's Nick is remarkable to watch.  Steiger (one of the greatest actors of all time) is at the top of his game as well, shading this `villain' role and giving it serious edge.  He nails the manipulative side of Nick and keeps the audience spellbound by his presence.

Coming out the same year as `Somebody Up There Likes Me' (Newman's star making boxing tale), I prefer this film.

As moralistic and on occasion unrealistic as was OTF, and having a 7 foot fighter with lead shoes instead of a fast on his feet ex-fighter (and coincidentally brother of Rod Steiger), we nonetheless have a very engrossing experience. ""History"" tells us it was Bogie's last - and to this Reviewer he does not appear ill at all, just his age - and there's a whole lot for boxing historians, as Jersey Joe Alcott and Max Baer have major roles.

Steiger (as the promoter) is on fire, though somewhat one-dimensional - this guy never quits. A boxer dies after a match and it's just another plus on his credit side. Hey, dese bums know da score...before the score is known.

Bogie's wife doesn't have much life...she can be talked out of visiting her man in lala land, who is helping, as a media liaison, to engineer carnival matches, to build up a national reputation, for the South American unbeatable.

Just as in Rocky and many such flicks, the actual matches are bizarre, with a dozen or so unanswered blows....and in truth after two fixes, the game would have been up. That's...Hollywood. But Rocky was a tight movie and had ""heart"". The heart of THTF comes about 20 minutes too late for the viewer, but it's a great final scene. In his tiny apartment, reconciled with his wife, the writer Willis says to Steiger and his enforcers, the pen is mightier than the sword. Though, here is where the Director let a powerful opportunity pass him by - it was a chance for Steiger to move on - as in, I came to kill this guy...but let him be.

""The Harder They Fall""  is at its heart a sports movie, the classic tale of the underdog going for the gold; be warned that far too much time is spent in the boxing ring.  Yet what renders this movie special are Humphrey Bogart's soulful, tortured eyes, and his journey-- common to every Humphrey Bogart movie, I think-- towards a conscience.  In general a woman, often his wife Lauren Bacall, is responsible for the transformation, but in this case we a have seven-foot tall Argentinian pugilist who arrives in the U.S. with only his rosary beads, his ingenuity and about two words of English.  We often see the 1950s in rosy retrospect, as a sort of decade-long version of ""Pleasantville,"" but as this movie reminds us, the era was imbued with as much terror and moral confusion as our own.  I also think that 1940s and 50s films provide far less facile answers than more modern movies like ""Avengers"" and ""Iron Man III.""

phony promises. Bogart gives the silver screen a fine farewell in his last film.
Rod Steiger plays the heavy,a shark that is only out for his own financial reward,
even if it means the death of a boxer. Bogie is a sports writer that promotes the
hype for a big pay day,until he sees the vultures in the so-called sport called

458319,5,6302360951,"I remember back in the day when my father would talk about all the great prize fighters of the past, and when he introduced me to this movie on the late show on CBS, before the era of 24 hour cable TV , I knew all the characters, who were portrayed in this epic Gangster/Prizefighting flick.  The movie is based on the life of heavyweight champion Primo Carnera , who in his day, was a giant of a man at 6' 7"" and 250 pounds.  The problem, is Primo had little fighting skill, and many of his matches were framed, unknown to Primo, who thought he was actually winning those fights on his own.  Along comes Max Baer who would have nothing to do with taking a dive for the sake of the mob, and administered a brutal beating on Primo to take the heavyweight crown.  With primitive fighting skills, he fought bravely with the heart of a lion, trying to defend himself, by actually landing some leather of his own, but in the end, it was one of the saddest day's in boxing history.  Having said all that, the movie is based on his life, with the main character boxer Toro Marino, who is taken to the top of the boxing world by unscrupulous mobsters who stole his earnings, and threw him to the streets in the end.  Humphrey Bogart plays a boxing beat reporter who worked along with the mob, and aided in the false promotion of this make believe giant of a boxer, and in the end, did the right thing for this abused soul, that almost gives you a lump in your throat. Heavyweight champ  Max Baer actually played the role of himself, under a different name for the movie script.  This is an intense movie about evil and good, and a classic not to be missed.  In real life, Primo left the boxing world broke, but became very successful in the world of professional wrestling and raised a family in california.  He stated, the happiest day of his life, is when he became an American citizen.  Known as the ""Ambling Alp"", Primo proved to be a model human being, loaded with kindness for all, which is more than can be said, for the real life mobsters who controlled the boxing game in the 30's, 40's and 50's.",1323648000,2,2097,4.323979591836735

458322,5,6302360951,"This bleak but realistic film about the netherworld of professional boxing is one of the best sports dramas that Hollywood ever produced. Humphrey Bogart, of course, is the centerpiece of the story and he's at his best as the cagey, jaded sports reporter who covers a heavyweight contender and knows he's a phony but nevertheless promotes him for box-office profits. The fighter, perhaps a take on Primo Carnera, is manipulated by a greedy manager and his underworld hoodlums who know full well that Toro Moreno has no business in a boxing ring. The camerawork is gritty and the picture has the look of grainy 1950s newsreels which add the the credibility of the movie. Rod Steiger and Nehemiah Persoff are great and Mark Robson's direction was excellent. Especially touching and tragic is an interview with a former boxer whose brains got scrambled from years of ring combat. A very powerful film and a great coda to Bogart's wonderful career.",1282521600,4,944,4.943396226415095
458323,5,6302360951,"I had been trying to catch this movie for a long time and when i finally did, I was not dissapointed.  The story involves corruption in boxing brilliantly portrayed by Humphrey Bogart and Rod Steiger.  Steiger plays a corrupt promoter who reels in a conscientious sports reporter who just lost his job (Bogart) into a boxing racket involving catapulting a no name unskilled and naive boxer from Argentina to fame.

The movie does a good job in showing the ugliness and politics involved in boxing.  The fight scenes are a little clumsy but the last fight is well choreographed.  You don't have to be a boxing fan to enjoy this movie, only a moral compass will do.  The 1950's New York City photogrophy is fun to look at also.  Highly recommended.",1264291200,,746,4.648854961832061
458324,4,6302360951,"This was an interesting story but not always enjoyable to watch, simply because it's a real downer in spots, and seeing a very ill Humphrey Bogart was sad.

Bogart, as ""Eddie Willis,"" plays a decent guy who knows he's doing the wrong thing so he's ornery for most of the film. His conscience is getting the best of him. Not many others in here are happy, either, for that matter, in this tale of crooked boxing. Boy, filmmakers in the '40s and '50s loved making crooked boxing stories.

What's also different about this is the featured boxer: a 6-foot-8 Argentinian import named ""Toro Moreno"" (Mike Lane), a stiff who is being groomed for the heavyweight championship via a series of fixed fights, led by the crooked promoter played by Rod Steiger.

Along the way, it was interesting to see real-life fighters Max Baer and Jersey Joe Walcott.

Bogart died of cancer a little over a year after making this film. He looked haggard, which is understandable, but he still did his normal excellent job of acting and keeping the story interesting. Like him or not, Bogart always got your interest.

Overall, it's a decent boxing film, but nothing spectacular, to be honest. There are many, many better boxing movies, but this is still worth watching.",1235088000,,1244,4.767441860465116
458325,4,6302360951,"Hollywood has had a long standing fascination with boxing. From Kid Galahad to Champion...From Requiem For A Heaveyweight to Raging Bull, all have portrayed the seemly underbelly of the ""sweet science"". The Harder They Fall stars Humphrey Bogart and Rod Steiger in a stunning portayal of the Mexican giant and Heaveyweight champion hopeful, Toro Moreno.

Loosely based on the real life story of the Italian champion Primo Carnera, Toro towers over his opponents, but he packs a punch that couldn't break an egg. And to make matters worse his jaw is as fragil as a Waterford chrystal goblet. Mobbed-up fight promoter Nick Bento (Rod Steiger) hires has-been sports writer Eddie Willis (Humphrey Bogart) as Toro's press agent. The two arrange for a series of bum-of-the-month-club bouts, with washed up pugilists. The bums are in the tank, as Toro racks up a dozen or more tainted victories. Eventually they get a shot to fight the number one contender for the heaveyweight crown. But the fighter is fresh off a brutal knock out at the hands of Buddy Brannen, (played by real life Heaveyweight champ Max Baer) the reining title holder. As he enters the ring with Toro, he is damaged goods and even Toro's cream puff blows cause him to hemmorage. Toro is devistated, as he believes his super human strength caused the fighter's death. It is now up to Bogart to convience Toro that he is innocent of this tragedy and that he must take one last fight with Brannen even though he has no chance of beating him.

Bogart and Steiger are exceptionally well cast and both deliver performances equal to their ""heaveyweight"" (pardon the pun) reputations. The supporting cast of Jan Sterling (Willis's long suffering wife), Nehemiah Persoff (the corrupt accountant and yes-man to Nick Bento) and real life heaveyweight champion ""Jersey"" Joe Walcott (Toro's sparring partner and brother's keeper) all provide the film with a gritty realism and authenticity. By the mid fifties Bogart had tarnished his remarkable film career with a series of ""B"" Grade stinkers. Fortunately his final role of Eddie Willis allowed this legendary and gifted actor a chance to go out with a flourish. Steiger too delivers a performance worthy of his greatest flim triumphs; On The Waterfront and In The Heat Of The Night. While The Harder They Fall may not make the American Film Institute's Top One Hundred list, it is nonetheless a finely crafted motion picture that will undoubtably make you think twice about the humanity of the ""sport"" of prize fighting. It might also teach you a thing or two about greed, oportunisim and redemption.",1233360000,,2603,4.967889908256881
458326,5,6302360951,"""The harder they fall"" is one of the bleakest films around the well known box underworld, genre that found a majuscule Ambassador in the emblematic film ""Set up"", directed by Robert Wise. On the other hand the dark and sinister ambiance assured it as one of the most potent Noirs ever made.

But also, this was the last performance of that mythical actor named Humphrey Bogart, who inspired by Paul Muni, inspired besides to so many actors of future generations like Lee Marvin, Al Pacino and Tim Roth among other ones.

A fundamental issue on your collection.",1199750400,,560,4.762886597938144
458327,5,6302360951,"Based on Budd Schulberg's 1947 novel, ""The Harder They Fall"" (1956) is a stunning indictment of the boxing profession. The film also marks Humphrey Bogart's final performance as a former sports writer turned publicist  and he's in good company. Bogie's scenes with Rod Steiger, Jan Sterling and Mike Lane (as the giant Argentinian boxer) are truly memorable. Mark Robson's no-nonsense direction makes the most of Burnett Guffey's Oscar-nominated cinematography. Unlike other screen legends, Bogart ended his career in classic fashion.",1192233600,11,534,5.675
458328,5,6302360951,"An ailing Bogart made his final appearance in Mark Robson's raw, hard-hitting film about corruption in the boxing world, playing a jaded press agent with a biting conscience. Steiger is in top form playing the ferocious ringleader of fraudulent bettors, and Mike Lane, as dim-witted, cruelly manipulated boxer Toro Moreno (modeled after Primo Carnero) is poignant and credible. Adapted from Budd Schulberg's novel, ""Fall"" spares nothing in portraying the unquenchable greed of local promoters, the rabidity of fans, and the heartbreaking physical toll the sport takes on the bodies of men who are barely regarded as human.",1182816000,7,622,5.422680412371134
458362,5,6302360951,"I was pleasantly surprised to catch this film on TV the other day.  Bogart's final film is a testament to his career, a tough film about a conflicted man who ultimately rises to the challenge and pursues the morally virtuous course, at great personal, professional, and financial cost.

In addition to Bogart's fantastic performance, Rod Steiger chews the scenery nicely as a corrupt manager.  Their scenes together are really well done, and very well written.  I particularly enjoyed the scene after the big fight where Bogart presses to find out how much their fighter will ultimately wind up for getting so badly beaten in the ring.

But for me I truly enjoyed Mike Lane's performance as the up and coming Argentinian fighter El Toro, who is huge, honest, religious, but unfortunately a terrible fighter.  His performance is precious.

458364,5,6302360951,"Disclaimer: I could watch Bogart make a tuna sandwich for an hour and a half.

I did enjoy this movie though.

It has such a new and simple premise that I had to check it out: a larger than life boxer from Argentina comes to America and is posed to be the next big fighting sensation because he *looks* the part.  The catch?  His glass jaw and powder puff punch.  But Toro remains oblivious to the fact that he can't fight because the boxing community is more theater than anything else.  Mostly.  When they throw Toro in the ring with a hot headed boxer who can't be bought, they throw him to the wolves.

Great film.  Again, it's obviously not the *best* Bogart film out there because there are too many great ones, but it's still very good.  Bogart never disappoints.",1165708800,6,770,4.397163120567376
458365,5,6302360951,"I have heard that this was Bogart's last movie. I consider it a treasure to have in my collection. The movie gives you an inside view of boxing. It seems that boxers were exploited and preyed upon by those who should have cared for them. Boxing is a strange profession. My heart went out to the young man in the story. Also the older man that Bogart interviewed. He had so many blows to his body. The poor man was reduced to what appeared to be living on the streets. He was suffering mentally and physically. When Bogart asked him about his future, he answered by saying ""future, what future."" No doubt this man was a functional person at one time. But boxing destroyed his mind and his body. I enjoyed the movie despite the subject. It's worth watching.",1155686400,3,755,4.438848920863309
458366,5,6302360951,"Bogart shines like a burning star in his last movie before his death.

458367,5,6302360951,"""The Harder They Fall"" was adapted from the 1947 novel by Budd Schulberg, a damning expos&eacute; of organized crime's role in professional boxing and its consequences. The film is reminiscent of both the social conscience films of the 1930s and the docudramas of the 1940s. The story was inspired by the career of 1933 World Heavyweight Champion Primo Carnera, whose victories are still hotly disputed among sports historians. Carnera's manager was Irish gangster Owney Madden, who may or may not have fixed his fights and then abandoned him to Max Baer, who won the 1934 World Heavyweight Championship. Max Baer has a role in this film, as a fictional defending heavyweight champ. In reality, Carnera was the defending champ, and both Baer and Carnera had killed a man in the ring. ""The Harder They Fall"" twists things a bit and changes the time frame to make a tight, dramatic, and hard-hitting film.

Eddie Willis (Humphrey Bogart) was a popular sportswriter until his newspaper folded and put his career on the skids. Now gangster Nick Benko (Rod Steiger) wants Eddie to promote his new investment, a boxer from Argentina named Toro Moreno (Mike Lane). Toro is a hulk , but he can't fight. Eddie's supposed to make it sound like he can, Benko will fix the fights, and they'll all make a lot of money. ""No one gets hurt,"" Benko promises. Eddie takes the job. They go on tour, Eddie hyping Toro as boxing's next great champion. Opponent after opponent take a dive for $1,000 as Toro works his way toward the Championship fight against vicious defender Buddy Brannen (Max Baer).

""The Harder They Fall"" was Humphrey Bogart's last film, and Eddie Willis was an archetypal role for Bogart. Eddie is a loner, a cynic, oblivious of the law but following his own moral code. He can be as brusque as the bad guys, but he has his principles. Rod Steiger is terrific as shrewd, amoral Nick Benko, who revels in the corrupt world of boxing and delivers most of the film's great lines. Max Baer is charismatic and convincingly ruthless as egotistical champion Brannen. ""The Harder They Fall"" has much in common with 1949's ""The Set-Up"", another terrific boxing film that criticizes the audience, managers, and fight promoters while sympathizing with the boxers. ""The Harder They Fall"" is beyond cynical, claiming that professional boxing was a scam on every level in which the fighters are the ultimately the victims. To this end, we get a lot of ""insider"" scenes of managers negotiating the fates of their boxers. ""The Harder They Fall"" may not have the social relevance that it did in 1956, but it's still a brilliant film with great performances, hard-boiled dialogue, and reverence for boxers.

The DVD (Columbia/ Tristar 2003): This is not a restored print of the film. It has some specks, but sound is good. There is a promotional spot for ""The Bogart Collection"" (4 min) and trailers for ""On the Waterfront"" (2  min) and the Muhammed Ali biopic ""The Greatest"" (3 min). Subtitles are available in English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean. Dubbing is available in Portuguese.",1132012800,,3090,4.902485659655832

458369,5,6302360951,"Whenever a new boxing film is being hyped, we inevitably get someone's list of great boxing films, yet The Harder They Fall never makes those lists. Screenwriter Philip Yordan and director Mark Robson took Budd Schulberg's tough but somewhat diffuse and repetitive novel and condensed it into an excellent film adaptation that is still a timely indictment of the corruption and brutality in the world of boxing. This was Bogart's last film, and actor's last films are generally terrible, but Bogie went out with a classic. The performances are generally excellent, and the scenes with Steiger and Bogart work beautifully, with Steiger's aggressive, fast-talking, almost lunging forward attack matched by Bogart's wary, laconic, reactive style of acting. Also excellent is the underrated Nehemiah Persoff, an Actors Studio alumnus, who himself resembles Steiger and who gave excellent support in numerous films and TV shows. Perhaps the film's only flaw is Bogart's 11th hour moral conversion, but it is acceptable enough and does lead to a final, excellent scene between Bogart and Steiger.",1084838400,3,1090,5.380116959064328
