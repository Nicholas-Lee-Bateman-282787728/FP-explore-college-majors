A bunch of friends 20s, smoking weed and their life away, saying, doing silly stuff, in fantasy land about Natalie Portman, whoever that is...and just spacing out, and all with girlfriend problems. STUPID, STUPID. I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK.

This movie should have never been made, and reviewers should write better reviews and tell the truth about these movies so we will know and make the right decision 'NOT TO BUY IT'.

I had to fast forward 8-10 times in a 1:45 min. movie, just to get pass the stupid junk. Minutes of film time wasted on just stupid stuff being repeated by one of the dope heads.  They are all dope heads.

There was only a several brief moments of real movie script that you can consider decent. A good plot that was destroyed by all the junk written into the script. In the end they all ended up with new girlfriends, but they all were still a mess.

I thought this was golng to be like Brothers and The Hood with Morris Chestnet. THIS WAS AWFUL.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I gave it a 1, but wished I could have given it a FAT ZERO 0.",1316131200,,1105,4.238095238095238
8275086,4,B0019RGPPM,"I got the chance to see ""Buds For Life"" and I really enjoy it! It is a funny movie, which in a way is something that always happens. When kids start to get older, they see how the other sex can cause such an atraction, that their friendship can pass to a second level. To try not to let this happen can be complicated and at the same time funny.
I had a great time watching this movie, I really recommend it, you'll be laughing the whole time.",1264118400,2,443,4.045454545454546
