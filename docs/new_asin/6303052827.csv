7835881,5,6303052827,My sister asked for this as a gift and says her kids love watching it.,1420329600,,70,3.7333333333333334
7835882,1,6303052827,"Ok so I saw this and luckily I only got it for $1 but it is really only worth a penny (if that). Anyway, so I thought great a french learning video! Let's check this out! Looks lame but...(should have listened to the looks lame part) let's see how she rolls.

So I place it in and the first thing I notice is the older than dirt beginning...ok...so what?

Well the repetition they kept repeating the words over and over and that is ok.

What my problems are..

The cat...it's ugly. Le chat est trs laid.

The songs...are pathetic. I mean they take way too long to make a song. They should just have done it through ONE full time..

Instead it is like this..

Sur le pont D'avignon
then you sing that
Sur le pont D'avignon
Then you sing that

And then well let's just say it's enough to make a person scream

The graphics are so bad a two year old could do better. I checked the date and it says it is around 1992 or 1993. More like it is from 10 BC.

They do the color yellow (jaune) but it doesnt even look yellow!

Counting is pathetic...they only count to seven.

I wouldn't get this

The cat, graphics, songs, colors, everything was bad

And French there were only a few words and mostly English

Oh and they didn't even tell what the words meant in the two songs!

Dont buy this. It really really sucks!

Well you could buy it and use it to discipline your kids

""Ok if you don't do your homework, you have to watch Bonjour Les Amis!""

Well no dont...that would be torture.

and cruel and unusual punishment.

Shoot if your kid cant sleep...use this.

There is no story plot...i mean er it is lame what there is

I thought it would teach kids or was hoping....greetings, weather, time, alphabet, colors, the basics but in a more animated and exciting way...

Well if you are looking for fun and great graphics and your kids wanting to watch this over and over?  Dont look here.

If you are looking for a way to torment your kids or punish them...buy this video!

If you are a French Teacher and you want to bore you class...Buy this video!",1250035200,,2044,4.268929503916449
7835883,5,6303052827,"This year for school our child expressed an interest in learning French. While doing a search through our library catalog I came across this video. Bonjour Les Amis is a gentle, delightful introduction to the French language. You will travel with ""Moustache"" and his friends through the village of Chavelle as you learn the basics of the French language.
We are planning to begin using Rosetta Stone after we have finished Volumes 1-3.",1192665600,,435,4.972602739726027
7835884,5,6303052827,"I'm a homeschool mom who has a French teacher come in to teach my children.  I find this video is a great compliment to the program. I love the repetion.  That's how my children learn.  The graphics are lame, but the overall affect is great.  My children learn French phrases and hear them repeated to make sure they say it correctly.  Their French teacher recomends the repetion.

It's not a story, it's instruction!  If you're looking for a story, try MUZZY.  We have that too.  I find Bonjour les Amis

a better beginning tool to use for teaching the French language.",1109808000,5,570,4.554455445544554
7835885,1,6303052827,This has to be the WORST foreign language video on the market.  It is incredibly slow and WAY too repetitive.  It also switches from condescending english instructions to poorly pronounced french.  It's ironic that a french instructional video has 3 times the amount of English in it than french.  It didn't even hold my 2 year olds intrest (and that's hard to do in the cartoon format).  I can't see how anyone could learn anything from this video.  Save your money.,1006560000,15,467,4.703703703703703
7835886,5,6303052827,"This video is an excellent choice for parents who crave more than the standard fare .  If tella tubbies are the equivalent of wonder bread than Moustache, the french cat, the star of this video is a bagette.  I cannot  account for the less than  favorable reviews above . I can only tell you  that my Two and one half year old son loves both vol .1 and vol. 2 and  speaks well over 75 words in french. I would highly reccomend this video  for ages 2-7.",951177600,26,452,4.126436781609195
7835887,2,6303052827,very repetitive; lacks the animation for child interest; songs are very drawn out; could be better.,943315200,13,99,5.25
7835888,1,6303052827,"Poor animation, hard-to-understand narration, and unimaginative story lines did not hold my son's attention - nor mine.",939168000,15,119,6.0588235294117645
