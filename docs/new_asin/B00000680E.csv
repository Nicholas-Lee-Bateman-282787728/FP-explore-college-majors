7903870,5,B00000680E,I teach a middle school multi-handicapped classroom where several of my students are in wheelchairs.  They absolutely love this video and beg to do it every day!!  Richard is so upbeat and friendly that my students relate to him easily.  The music is happy and peppy to keep the students moving.  I am so glad I found a copy of this to use!,1457827200,,340,4.349206349206349
7903871,5,B00000680E,"The tape will have to be returned. It wouldn't play correctly. Many of the sections are fuzzy. I was very disappointed that the seller didn't check it out before sending it. UPDATED 7/31/14 The seller immediately refunded the money. I would buy from them again.

I'm in a rehabilitation facility due to my feet. This is the video they play 5 days a week. Since we only do the section sitting in a chair, it's about 15 mins. Having gained some weight 15 mins is not enough to lose weight and get back in shape so I bought my own copy. I will sometimes play it back to back 3 - 4 times or play it first then play one of the 6 other chair dancing or chair exercise tapes or cds I have.",1396137600,,682,4.08955223880597
7903872,5,B00000680E,"I LOVE this exercise video!  Its excellent for anyone who has a physical disability, because all of the exercises is adapted for people in wheelchairs, walkers, or who use leg braces.  I seriously wish this Richard Simmons Video was put out of DVD, because its wonderful.

According to Richard Simmons autobiography, the reason this video was short lived was because too many people complained of the cover of the video case, saying that it looks like he is exploiting disabled people.  The book that is by the same name was also short lived for the same reason.  This is a shame, since there are not many exercises tapes and DVD's that are designed just for disabled kids and adults.",1395964800,,684,4.714285714285714
7903873,4,B00000680E,"I found this video encouraging.  No matter what my physical ability level on a given day, I can do this video and feel more in control of my life.",1395360000,,146,4.0344827586206895
7903874,2,B00000680E,I was very disappointed when I received it.  It was my fault but next time I'll  look more closely.  I assumed it was a DVD but it's a VHS tape and I no longer have that kind of player.  I've checked with all my friends and no one has a player that converts from a VHS tape to a DVD.  I've checked stores and on line but they are all to expensive and it would cost me more to send it back.  So I guess I'll hang on to it and maybe I'll run across one some day.  I am so disappointed.  Anything from Richard Simmons is usually really great!!,1392163200,,540,3.8454545454545452
7903875,1,B00000680E,"Tape does not work, something is wrong with it. No volume and the tape jumps. Did not check it before getting rid of the packaging. Too bad had a hard time finding a tape for exercise in a sitting position.",1390867200,,206,4.175
7903876,1,B00000680E,"this tape has a serious flaw in my opinion. i was very excited to get it after reading all the reviews here. no one mentioned that a large majority of the exercises are done out of the wheelchair lying on the floor. well, in my particular case, i cannot get out of the wheelchair down to the floor at all so this tape was a total waste of money for me. i am able to do about 5 minutes of exercises which are actually warm ups for the floor work and even they are all arm and neck work, very little leg work. it was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to me.",1066608000,58,542,3.9363636363636365
7903877,5,B00000680E,"I am a paraplegic from a birth defect, paralyzed the knees down. Richard Simmons is a major motivator in keeping fit and healthy and he makes the exercises easy to do, fun and really a good workout on the whole body  whether you can move your whole body or not. The video really gets me  pumping! Go get it!",915321600,37,307,4.186440677966102
