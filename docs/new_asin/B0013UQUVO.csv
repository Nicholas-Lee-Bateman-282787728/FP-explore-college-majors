8253017,5,B0013UQUVO,"A collection of comical, bizarre, and heart wrenching shorts. The skill of the artists involved is phenomenal. You will think about the content of these emotional clips long after you've watched them.",1265760000,3,200,5.28125
8253018,4,B0013UQUVO,"Overall, I really liked this selection of shorts and found it to be an engaging, provocative mix - and there were cowboys, randy cowboys! La Perra was hilarious and absurd; Antichrist a grueling, dark picture of war; Old Woman's Step (along w/ LP one of my favorites)I found to be quite touching in it's richness, beauty, sadness and simplicity. I didn't particularly get(or really dig)We Decided Not to Die, but other viewing friends/critics were really into it.",1231804800,,463,5.025974025974026
8253019,1,B0013UQUVO,"These six shorts from around the world are so bad I couldn't believe my eyes. I was disappointed. Much of the disk is no better than what I would expect from immature adolescents with movie-making tools, but some of it actually is depraved, is shallow, or celebrates pure ethnic ugliness (inside and out). I hope this doesn't sound jingoistic but it made me proud to be an American (none of the shorts are American). Are other countries' film industries that primitive? Avoid it if you can.",1230940800,2,490,4.709302325581396
8253020,5,B0013UQUVO,"The World According to Shorts by Hugo Maza, Daniel Askill, Hans Petter Moland, is a multifaceted collection of visually stunning and provocative short films.  Some (like Antichrist) are as disturbing as they are beautiful.  A sign of a strong film for me is that it haunts me long after I have seen it.  This collection played in my thoughts for weeks after my viewing.",1226793600,2,369,4.734375
8253021,5,B0013UQUVO,"The first short ""La Perra"" is a funny, quirky film
with an absurdist tendency, great cast, and
recommended for all who are looking for less obvious
methods to spice up their love life.

The black & white animation ""Ring of Fire"" about two
wild west buddies in a pretty lively lanscape (e.g.
female body parts performing french can-can) gives
wavy, flowing hair a whole new meaning! Besides music
and dance, liquor, camp fire and shoot-outs, there's
an impressive lady in black - and look for her
mechanical piano player! Great soundtrack & -design.

The norwegian film (United We Stand) shows us what
""all for one"" entails. Brilliant how beautiful
landscape shots, songs of solidarity, very black
humor, and a touching illustration of aforementioned
proverb all work together to create a memorable (only
seemingly simple) film.

The australian film ""We Have Decided Not to Die"" shows
us three episodes or 'rituals'. Absolutely stunning in
both content and style, mysterious, very beautifully
shot and edited (intriguing use of effects), stylized
(great colors, use of symmetry, perfect
cinematography.) All three rituals involve artful
convulsions, and take place in environments devoid of
other humans. ""Birth"" takes place, very aesthetically,
in a pool, underwater. In ""Between"" we are shown
something like 'man against machine'. And in ""Rebirth""
we follow a young man into an office tower, up the
elevator, and choosing a daredevil way out again.
Truly fascinating film.

The other shorts share the ability to touch, and stir
associations one can't necessarily pin down, which is
part of the appeal. Great experience.",1224892800,5,1620,5.267441860465116
8253022,5,B0013UQUVO,"This is a great collection of eclectic shorts from all over the world. The selection is extremely well thought out, from the grotesquely engrossing bourgeois paranoia of ""la perra"" to the wonderful ""united we stand"". Each short leaves you strangely satisfied but wanting to see more. Most definitely not to be missed!",1212624000,2,317,5.115384615384615
