7771343,5,B01GWE5ZE8,"After ""Jaws,"" there have been truckloads of shark movies: Some are good, some decent, some (the vast majority) are the equivalent of a train wreck driven by a bull through a china store. ""In The Deep"" is refreshingly good, it has a gripping story, compelling characters and a good number of scares. A little gem than needs to be mined, because it would be such a pity for it to get lost in the shuffle.",1472860800,,402,4.373333333333333
7771344,2,B01GWE5ZE8,"Two sisters vacation in Mexico, do the shark cage thing and get trapped in the cage at 37 meters with issues being sharks, air, and nitrogen bubbles. Kate (Claire Holt) has been everywhere and done everything and Lisa just broke up with her boyfriend. He said she was boring. I know the subtitle is 47 meters, but their depth meter read 37 meters.

The characters proved to be shallow and a film shot mostly in and around a shark cage didn't make things exciting after the first few minutes. I did like the last few minutes, but they needed to generate something before that...like maybe have the girls shower? And what was that seconding ending?

This is easily the best shark film in the last 10 years. Better than The Shallows - it's Terrifying and Claustrophobic in the best possible way!

The only reason i watched this movie basically for the sharks i love sharks.. they're so squishy. They should cast a different actors for this and maybe a different movie plot.",1469836800,,402,4.0886075949367084

This one will deffinetly get under your skin so watch if you wanna good entertaining movie. I hate the fact that they changed the title of this a few times, first it was called in the deep witch is the one i own on dvd when it first originally came out then it was gunna be called 47 meters down witch i thought wasn't a good title to call it and third of all they call it the deep? Hmm not any better other then the title name change and the cover this is a excellent movie. Though its not the original anymore but it still should be the same tho nothing is better then owning the original film. This is a great movie, take my word for it!!!",1499040000,,785,4.038461538461538

47 Meters Down
Director: Johannes Roberts
Starring: Mandy Moore (Lisa), Claire Holt (Kate)
Plot: Two close sisters Lisa and Kate go on a vacation in Mexico to get away from their lives. They get invited to a special cage diving boat, where one is lowered into the ocean inside of a diving cage to get up close to ocean life including 24 foot long great white sharks. Things quickly go wrong, and the cage that holds Lisa and Kate drops 47 Meters below to the ocean floor and they must fight, outthink and survive

This a dumb, popcorn munching movie with plenty of suspense and terrifying moments that will have you occasionally jump, but leave you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Considering that this movie probably has a much lower budget than super hero movies, it was smart of the director to have most of the movie take place 47 meters below the ocean surface where everything is murky and dark, which also creates many moments of tension. This also allowed the director to use the CGI sharks more sparingly thus making the sharks more fearsome as you had no idea when they would actually strike.  While watching this movie I realized that there weren't many set pieces, but the direction of the movie was so well done, and the sharks looked so terrifying that I found myself getting sucked into the movies environment. What also helped this movie were the great performances of Moore and Holt, whom really sold the idea that they were about to die every minute the movie was pushing forward, and they were constantly fighting for their lives. Because a majority of the movie had them on screen, it was imperative that they sold the movie through their performances and I thought they did a great job of making you feel their fear and terror.

I had a few gripes with the movies, as the movie fell into the usual horror tropes of explaining things early so that the movie came back to address those exact addressed issues, so it actually made the movie more predictable for me rather than the movie having true surprises. I also felt the ending of the movie killed this movie as this movie has essentially two different endings, and I thought the first ending was much more compelling than the second one, and the latter left a sour taste in my mouth. The first ending made you really fear the desperation of survival and the fight that the characters were in, but the second one seemed to veer off into the more gotcha mentality of the movie going experience that left me wanting more than feeling the movie felt complete. Still watching these two sisters dive, lift, and swim to survive was enjoyable for the hour and half time this movie lasted.",1498089600,,2698,4.593360995850622

8764214,5,B01GWE5ZE8,"Two sisters Lisa and Kate go to Mexico for a vacation. Lisa wants to put her breakup out of her mind and live it up to show him and Kate wants the thrill of being near sharks, so they go on a random, not hotel approved shark swimming excursion. Despite the fact Lisa has no idea how to scuba dive, they get in the shark cage and are lowered down after chumming the waters to attract the great white sharks. Everything is wonderful at first, but the line snaps and they sink to the ocean floor. Running out of air and surrounded by sharks, chances of survival are not good for these sisters.

Apparently, 47 Meters Down was supposed to come out around the time that The Shallows did, but was postponed due to the other film's popularity. 47 Meters Down is clearly the superior of the two shark films that has actual suspense, horror, and action. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film and the situation changed slightly during the course of the film. First, the sisters are in the cage at the bottom of the ocean. Throughout the film, they leave the safety of the cage for specific objects or to get close enough to communicate with the boat that brought them. It changes where the threat is coming from and which danger has higher priority: running out of air or being eaten by sharks.

The relationship between the sisters is the most important part of the film for me. Despite astronomical odds and their own panic, they work to keep each other calm and encourage each other. They are a team no matter what. In many films, tensions rise and ugly things come out when situations look bleak. They will go above and beyond for each other even when things seem impossible. The ending is completely unexpected. Some clues are given on the way as to its nature, but they are easy to dismiss.

The only flaws were relatively small. The excursion crew made a big deal about getting the bends ascending to the surface, but I'm sure rushing to the ocean floor would have the same effect. That crew's whole motivation for staying is pretty suspicious. I would guess that they were people who want to do the right thing, but the cynic in me says they realistically would have left. No one knew the women went with them. Who would know if they just left? I very much enjoyed this film despite its flaws and it's worlds better than any shark film in the last decade.",1478736000,,2365,4.407322654462242

8764218,5,B01GWE5ZE8,"fyi:  **UPDATE** Weve reached out to Anchor Bay. The August 2nd DVD release of In the Deep has officially been pulled in support of Entertainment Studios theatrical release of the film as 47 Meters Down (unless of course the title changes again).

In the Deep has had a weird journey on its way to release. Formerly 47 Meters Down, the flick is scheduled to come out next week on August 2nd via the Weinsteins and Anchor Bay. As I sit here, I have a review copy of final product sitting on my desk. Today, however, things have changed.

THR is reporting that Byron Allens Entertainment Studios has acquired North American rights to the Mandy Moore shark thriller 47 Meters Down from the Weinsteins and will distribute it on 2,500-plus screens using the original title through its recently purchased theatrical distribution company Freestyle Releasing in 2017.",1476230400,3,859,4.910344827586207
8764219,5,B01GWE5ZE8,"I am into Shark Movies since Jaws and hoped for a great one for decades but now its has arrived finally....In the deep is simply the most scary and claustrophobic, creepy and exciting shark thriller i have seen since Jaws and not to forget the Reef.
Sure, Jaws is out of reach but beeing more of a drama, adventure, horror movie and therefor one of a kind this one here delivers great visuals, lots of scares and suspense on a smaller but not less effective range. Actors and story is entertaining good, the Fx sharks look even more real the the big budget cgi shark seen in the shallows, which means a lot here. I saw the shallows at cinema with some friends and right after it at home we watched in the deep and it was really funny that we all were more scared and breathless watching in the deep !!! For it is and wants to be it is a nearly perfect movie doing for sharks what the decent did for caves.  A must see movie right away and a shame it didn't comes ti cinema theaters... don't miss it !!!!",1476144000,,1003,4.196891191709844
