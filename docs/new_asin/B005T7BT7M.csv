4888386,4,B005T7BT7M,"I really enjoyed this. Character development was great; I could really relate to the characters. Not the best acting in the world, but the actors seemed ""real.""  Loved the storyline. It had some unexpected twists, which I appreciated. Also nice because you rarely see films about black lesbians and their friendships. Thumbs up!",1330300800,,328,5.188679245283019
4888387,5,B005T7BT7M,"Just rented ""Family"" and i must say i was thoroughly surprised for a B-list movie. I felt like the movie gave a great representation of black lesbians and the many issues that surround coming out, sexual identity, and dealing with one's professional image.  I would totally recommend viewing this film especially if you are an ethnic woman in your late 20's to mid 30's who may be struggling with coming to terms with being gay. The acting was actually pretty good and convincing for being a lower budget film. I wish they would produce a sequel because this film has so much potential and room to take the storyline to new heights.",1328400000,16,632,4.642857142857143
4888388,5,B005T7BT7M,"Never heard of this film but ended up purchasing it after it was recommended by Amazon and I must say, I LOVED THIS FILM.  I came out in college but I can understand the challenges this group of women faces trying to come out in their 30s.  Great acting by some beautiful actresses and a terrific storyline.

I would say this is a must see for all members of the LGBT community.  And I would add that the issues of challenges with family, conflicts with friends and matters of the heart are universal problems that everyone must deal with and can relate to.",1325548800,7,557,4.378640776699029
4888389,4,B005T7BT7M,"This film was enjoyable. It presented a topic that is rarely touch upon - and it did that with class.  Understanding that this is a low budget film, with a novice director and editor, you can really appreciate the story line, and overall quality. Kudos to Faith Trimel. I hope she inspires others to make films which highlight the diverse lives of black lesbians.",1323993600,10,363,4.671875

4888396,4,B005T7BT7M,"I read the other reviews for this film. But after viewing I was pleasantly surprised. The acting while not Oscar worthy, was honest. I recommend this film to any lesbian of color looking for independent films that reflect the many facets of the African American lesbian community.",1425081600,2,280,4.9787234042553195

4888402,3,B005T7BT7M,"A nice lesbian film about a group of woman who have become like a small family to each other. Small Dyke drama here and there, a little love story tossed in, On Lesbian who falls for a male. And how her friends judge her which I thought was dumb, love is to hard to find if you find it at all be happy for that person don't judge. But that just me. Anyway as I day dyke drama and family. Bring on the sister sledge. ""We our Family I Got all my Sister and Me.""",1401840000,2,459,3.8421052631578947
4888403,5,B005T7BT7M,I loved this movie so much it was so good and exciting. I feel it was well done.. Most black lesbian movies are poorly made but this one was  awesome and quality.,1401494400,,162,4.0625
4888404,5,B005T7BT7M,The movie held my attention...it was more informative & inspriational than I'd anticipated. I keep it as one of my favorites that I reply frequently....LOVE IT!!!,1401062400,,162,5.269230769230769
4888405,5,B005T7BT7M,Loved it. The closeness honesty love bond and being truthful about there sexuality highly recommend a must see for all,1390867200,,118,4.95
4888406,5,B005T7BT7M,The different scenarios the women are very much true to our culture. It was spot on. I like it the B rated movie. The acting was semi Ok. The characters situations are what made the movie relatable.,1389139200,,198,4.378378378378378
4888407,5,B005T7BT7M,"I'm pretty hard on black movies overall and this is one of the best I've seen.

POSITIVES:
This is one really great story! It is skillfully woven and incorporates a really wide range of experiences. I truly believe that every bisexual or lesbian African-American woman can find some character or situation to connect with. Well acted, well directed, well cut, and artistically-filmed. More than once I laughed, I cried, and I actually said out loud ""this is really good!""

NEGATIVES:
Honestly, after reading the negative reviews I expected this movie to be much lower level than it was. Yes, once you saw the camera man's shadow, once someone coughed in the background and a few times you could tell the difference in the image quality (probably due to the shifts in cameras). Frankly, however, most of the actors were extremely good (minus one really noticeably inconsistent Jamaican accent).

OVERALL: This movie is definitely worth watching. Rent it at least.",1387497600,3,962,5.037735849056604
4888408,4,B005T7BT7M,"Extraordinary on multiple levels. Weather its true friendship, being who you really are, or seeking an understanding for a loved one or self...this not a film NOT to pass on...you won't be disappointed",1383091200,,201,5.121212121212121
4888409,2,B005T7BT7M,"There were some cute parts, but based on the reviews I expected a better storyline, better dialogue and not cheap looking movie with typical stereotypes.",1376611200,,153,5.16
4888410,1,B005T7BT7M,"I understand this was a low budget film but the acting was stilted and jokes just weren't funny.  I could only make it through 15mins and then had it turn it off.  I saw the camera person's shadow and heard them bump into something!  the story line seemed interesting enough for me to give it a go, but unfortunately it was disappointing.",1372896000,,338,4.419354838709677
4888411,5,B005T7BT7M,"As social attitudes and cultural mores continue to evolve in efforts to more accurately reflect the country's ""new"" demographics, this
brilliant, independently produced and financed look at the trials and tribulations of ""coming out"" is tastefully and sensitively done,
while being hilariously funny in several scenes. It's every bit as good as ""Something New"" with Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker,
(another exceptional film that went criminally underseen), and should open a lot of eyes to how much courage it takes to just
be who you are...",1370649600,,539,5.27906976744186
4888412,3,B005T7BT7M,"I guess I couldn't relate to the people in the story, It's worth watching though. Other people may like it!!",1369785600,,108,4.45
4888413,4,B005T7BT7M,"Worth watching!  A story that is not often told, and characters that are not often seen in film.  Likable characters, well written.",1367539200,,131,4.909090909090909
4888414,5,B005T7BT7M,"this was one of my favorite coming out movies funny, entertaining, truthful, at times sad but all in all a great movie!! A great date movie for the girls/bois lol",1367107200,,162,4.433333333333334
4888415,1,B005T7BT7M,"This is a home made thing. (As in, my 8 yr old. cousin kind of stuff) It was shot using some cheapo electronics store type camera. There was virtually no script and I would be willing to bet money that they partially improvised - think of a group of people getting together and discussing a general idea for a story line and then everyone sorta winging it.",1366502400,,356,4.3283582089552235
4888416,3,B005T7BT7M,"My partner and I expected this to be low-budget and maybe even a bit corny. Well, we weren't wrong.
However, there is a HUGE lack of black lesbian movies (esp those that feature ""studs"") so I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt when I watch them. When it was all said and done, this movie wasn't at all disappointing, in spite of the low production value and sometimes questionable acting.
Mostly, it was an average portrayal of situations that some black lesbians face and I can appreciate the effort.",1365724800,,515,4.608695652173913
4888417,4,B005T7BT7M,"This started out like a real stinker, as in skunk stink. But, we stayed with it and it turned out to be a very good representation of the trials and tribulations of being lesbians. If you can wade through the first 10 or so minutes, it will be worth your time. Youngsters wouldn't appreciate how these women have suffered throughout their lives, mainly because today's LGBT community doesn't face the fear factor in being gay/lesbian. Thank God they can be out and proud and that society today is finally, step by step, giving ALL of us equality. I had a time trying to keep a couple of the characters straight but it honestly didn't effect the movie. I AM glad we rented it instead of buying it. Good rental, not for owning. Of course, that's our opinion. You may decide to buy after watching it. Glad we watched it. Oh, btw, we're in our mid 60's and have been together over 46 years. ;o)",1364947200,2,890,4.432926829268292
4888418,5,B005T7BT7M,"I really enjoyed this film. There are so few films/shows that depict black lesbian relationships and ""Family"" is definitely one of the best of the bunch. I really loved the actresses and actors that were chosen for this film as well as the plot which was easy to follow but still touched on many very important and relatable issues. Much respect to everyone involved. Thank you for your work. :)",1361404800,,395,4.6571428571428575
4888419,2,B005T7BT7M,"I can't believe how terrible the acting is in this film. It's truly like watching a trainwreck...or a bad car accident! I rented this movie because I was happy to see there was a Black film about a group of lesbians who have been living in the closet and make a pact to come out together. The review I read said it was like ""The L Word"" and ""Girlfriends"" when in reality it was really nothing like either one of those shows. Again, the acting was so terrible it was hard to get into the movie and have any empathy for any of the cast members. I couldn't connect to any of them. I really wish I could give this film a 4 or 5 star rating, God knows there aren't many movies with the subject matter addressed for Black lesbians, but unfortunately it missed the mark.",1359590400,,763,4.197278911564626

4888421,3,B005T7BT7M,"The movie is good given the way the contenet is handled. Some insights worth noting are revealed. This is not a must see, but seeing it once will provide a bit of entertainment.",1356220800,,177,4.393939393939394
4888422,4,B005T7BT7M,A good coming out movie through and through.  Very heartfelt and funny.  I would recommend this movie to all of my friends.,1355356800,,123,4.545454545454546
4888423,3,B005T7BT7M,"The storyline was ok a group of friends making a pact to ""come out"" together at end of 30 days and the dilemmas they face in doing so. The acting was mediocre and on par with a low budget film. I guess it was worth the $3.00  I shelled out to watch it on instant video but doubt I'll be buying the DVD.",1351036800,,302,3.7936507936507935
4888424,5,B005T7BT7M,I saw the title of this movie on another website. It is a great movie show casing african american lesbians and the realities of the world lived in. Hats off for a great production.,1349568000,5,181,4.352941176470588
4888425,2,B005T7BT7M,"I was very excited at the prospect of viewing this movie after seeing/reading all the accolades it had received. But I must say I was greatly disappointed. I felt the acting was average and the writing was trying to keep a heavy topic light; it didn't work. A much better choice would be Pariah which also expresses an aspect of coming out but with much better acting, cast selection and direction. Another excellent choice would be Saving Face. Both are 5 star efforts in my book.",1338768000,,481,4.604651162790698
4888426,4,B005T7BT7M,"As others have said, the concept is good, but the directing, sound production and editing is not up to par.  The actors did everything that they could to tell the story, but were really hampered by poor editing decisions.

I like the whole cast, but maybe the producers would have been able to tell a better story if they trimmed the cast, and got rid of the psychiatrist, who sounded like a textbook.

I rented the movie for .99 cents, and I can't recommend spending more than that to see it, even though it is at times heartwarming and has some funny scenes.  It is nice to see movies the are about black lesbians, and where the cast can actually act.",1338595200,,653,4.371900826446281
4888427,5,B005T7BT7M,"This movie was excellent!  I was a little scared to purchase at first, but then I said, what the heck I'll purchase it.  I am so glad I purchased this DVD it hits on a lot of points lesbians go through.  I'd recommend this movie to any lesbian who is ""in the closet""!!",1337731200,,268,4.018867924528302
4888428,5,B005T7BT7M,"I thought the subject matter was gracefully and richly dealt with. I didn't expect that the acting in a little indie film would be so great. I was touched in places during the film and I laughed out loud in others. I felt the theme was specific--coming out--but it was universal: the courage it takes to be honest about who you are and what family and friends mean in that equation. I found the cast to be diverse and the performers, on a totally shallow note, to be just gorgeous men and women. This film is in my collection and I intend watch it again and again because every time I do, I see something I missed the previous time.",1332806400,,632,4.275
4888429,5,B005T7BT7M,it's low budget but the actresses made every dollar count. i liked that the film dealt with real life issues amoung black lesbian women even though i can't relate personally i find that the issues addressed were things that many black lesbians can relate to. i suppose i am a little bias in this review i gave it a 5 star rating because your RARELY find movies that deal with black lesbians and i thought that alone was fantastic and i am very proud to see this. i would truely recommend this movie to anyone but especially for black lesbians.,1331856000,2,543,4.44
