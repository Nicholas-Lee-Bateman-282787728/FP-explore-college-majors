4572749,5,B00559EDY0,"Listen to the guy who gave it four stars. INCREDIBLE FILM. Very much like ""requiem for a dream"". You have to watch the whole film to get it, not surf on your phone like the 3rd reviewer commented.",1427760000,5,196,4.184210526315789
4572750,3,B00559EDY0,"if you don't already like foreign films, then I don't recommend watching it. if you confuse there, they're and their, I would also recommend you not watch this film. if you are even a little bit ethnocentric-- again, this film is not for you.
if, on the other hand, you like art films, attending Cannes Film Festival would be a dream come true for you, or maybe Sundance if you don't often get to France, then you will appreciate this film.
The cinematography and editing were really nicely done. Any film that can move along in Four languages without skipping a beat is rather impressive in my book. The story follows the downward spiral of addiction and chronicles the ever greater compromises the main character has to take to maintain her habit.  If you've seen Requiem for a Dream, this is a lot like that. Only in Swiss. And French. And English. And German.
 I think it was really well done.",1427500800,21,897,4.565217391304348

4572849,5,B00559EDY0,"Fantastic movie. Well acted but also delightful plot ... not what I was expecting threw in a unfamiliar plot line but a real gem that is about more than just addiction. Its a love story meets femme fatale meets tragic epic journey to save the one true thing the lead actors have discovered that gives their life meaning. This is not your typical slow moving French film that wallows in its own search for direction, rather it is a nicely balanced and absorbing story that is very believable without being predictable but at the same time very touching. Long story short, watch it if you like Foreign films, rap music, love stories or just great scenery from Paris, Zurich or foreign languages. Being resident abroad for a long period of my life, it was right up my street if you know what I mean.",1453852800,8,796,4.534722222222222

8457716,3,B00559EDY0,"Surprisingly a decent movie... good thing though i understand deutsch or i'd spend most of my time reading subtitles... the english subtitles isn't bad, as it doesn't stray from the original context of the script..

the plot is decent, as it tells how one's life can descend down from having a drug lifestyle.. story seems to be on a decent pace, as it started on how the main character is having a great life around her, and as she started consuming more drugs, all the things she took for granted left her",1514073600,,507,4.510869565217392
