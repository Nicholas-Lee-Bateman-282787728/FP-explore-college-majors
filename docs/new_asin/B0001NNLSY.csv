8200771,2,B0001NNLSY,the video in itself is not that bad but if you want this to be a family event i would stay away. the one kangaroo you get to know and love dies. you see it from when it is first born to about 10 months old. the mother leaves it behind and Jaffy gets attacked by animals. when the mother finally goes back to find him the kangaroo is to weak to go with her. so you have to sit there and watch the poor thing die.,1131580800,,411,3.735632183908046
