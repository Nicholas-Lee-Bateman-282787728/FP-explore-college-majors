315903,5,6301133404,"One of My Favorites, A young Detective while working undercover because he does not look old eneough to be a cop is notified that his Brother in High School is being arrested for murdering a teacher. A situation in which the Young Looking Detective decides he believes his Brother and goes Undercover in his Brother High School to find out Who really commited the Crime.

315904,4,6301133404,"""Plain Clothes"" is a quirky mystery-comedy. It has always been a favourite around our house, but it's difficult to find another house that has seen it!  Arliss Howard is perfect as Nick Dunbar, a 'young-looking' undercover detective who must go 'plain clothes' into an odd high school to find evidence to clear his brother on a murder rap.  Turns out the staff at this school are all a bit wacky and include the likes of George Wendt, Dianne Ladd, Abe Vigoda, Harry Shearer and Robert Stack (over a live PA system: ""Is this thing on?  Now bombing Moscow""). No shortage of suspects.  Add to this: Nick doesn't like teens or kids - never did - never was one himself, apparently! He draws the ire of the local 'frat' boys, who don't know what they're up against. And watch for a hilarious scene in which Nick decides to convince everyone that he's for real by presenting his 'metaphor' homework. ahem.  Language class was never like this in my town.",1105228800,7,946,4.607142857142857
315905,5,6301133404,"I got this film out on video some years ago and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It doesn't have the most exciting plot in the world but it is a fun film.  Arliss Howard plays a youthful looking cop who goes back to school in order  to prove his younger brother innocent of the murder of a teacher.  However  being a student in the 1980s isn't as easy as Arliss hopes it will be and  he soon finds himself in trouble with the Principal and fellow students  whilst falling in love with his pretty young English teacher.  There are  some hilarious moments in the film.  One such moment happens when he knocks  the Principal unconscious and ends up being paddled as punishment.  Robert  Stack does a great job as the bumbling Principal and his words to Arliss  before he paddles him, ""This will hurt me more than you,"" had me  in stitches.  Also Arliss has to ward off a pretty fellow student who sees  him as her next conquest.  The overall plot isn't complicated, and it is a  little slow moving in parts but it's such a nice film you don't really  mind.  All the actors are competent and Arliss Howard is great as a cop  with a lot on his plate. This is a nice little film that all the family  will enjoy and is well worth seeing if you want something that is a little  different and fun.",961027200,7,1281,4.2635983263598325

316350,1,6301133404,Let me start out by saying I love 80's movies but this one sucked. It was not at all funny and I found it annoying. I stayed with it the whole movie and it was ridiculous but not good ridiculous like swamp thing or class of nukem high. Big let down,1419465600,,248,3.8823529411764706
316351,2,6301133404,"Frequently dismal 1980's comedy about a police detective who goes undercover 21 Jump Street style at a high school when his brother is arrested for murdering a teacher.  The problems with this film are many, which is why it barely received a theatrical release back in 1987.  The attempts at comedy are persistently dreadful--one example is the running joke where the police officer adopts the cover name Nick Springsteen and people ask if he's any relation and he answers distant.  It doesn't get any funnier for being repeated a half-dozen times.

Arliss Howard is also badly cast--he looks closer to 40 than high school, has the comedic chops of Gummo Marx and seems to be miserable during the entire length of the movie.  The thing that keeps Plain Clothes from being a complete waste of time for viewers not searching for 80's nostalgia is that if you scrape off all the toxic comedy there's a pretty good crime story underneath.  The writer of Plain Clothes later wrote and directed two fine crime films--The Lookout and A Walk Among the Tombstones.  Plain Clothes proves that everyone has to start somewhere.",1412467200,,1115,4.867724867724868
316352,4,6301133404,"If you love 1980's teen comedies, you are going to love this one. A young cop who gets no respect from the hardboiled cops around him gets pushed into going undercover in high school because of an unsolved murder, he turns what seems to be another drag of an assignment into a golden opportunity for advancement and romance. Lots of big hair and hilarious 80's clothes added to my enjoyment, and there's lots of celebrity spotting of actors from old sit-coms and movies!

I definitely enjoyed every moment of Plain Clothes, no matter how silly. It's a bit disappointing that I'd never heard of this movie before I spotted it on Amazon.com! Lots of fun!",1410134400,2,652,4.6695652173913045
316353,4,6301133404,"I can't say if the idea for this film or the 21 Jumpstreet series came about first but there's no reason they can't exist together. This plays out as a longer and better episode. Having just watched Plain Clothes again, I have the VHS, there is a lot that could be missed on a first watching. Once you know the ending you'll start picking up on the clues and all the small things that come together, look carefully, read everything, and listen to everything from the announcements to the snippets of conversations characters have. It's not too suspenseful, not too funny, it feels just right if you want to kick back and enjoy a good movie. Use personal judgement before letting kids watch because of language and violence.

One thing I do remember and miss on the VHS, can't say on the DVD, is a quick scene of how Nick gets his hat. I remember seeing this on TV and that was one of the little things that stuck in my mind along with 'Parts Needed'.",1409011200,,950,4.3977272727272725
316354,5,6301133404,"I saw this on TV years ago but couldn't quite remember the name, I did remember some of the little things like phrases written on the blackboard and that Norm from Cheers was in it. As for being the Case of the 30 Year Old Freshman I don't know if this movie predates the 21 Jumpstreet series or not but the idea is basically the same, cop goes under cover at a high school. And I'll leave the plot at that. It's silly in places but it also has some great suspense.

My only gripe is the VHS is missing a scene or two, like how he gets his hat.",1408320000,,544,3.9454545454545453

This is a rare gem that is well worth the watch. If you enjoy subtle comedy with a touch of suspense, you won't regret taking a chance on this film.",1405036800,2,395,3.7142857142857144
316519,3,6301133404,This is the only time I've seen this actor be a main character in a film and I think that's sad because he was so good in this. His brother is an actor you'll see a lot in movies like Mumford and the television show Bones on FOX. The movie is like many 1980's movies at that time. I liken it to a mix between Hiding Out and 21 jump street. This version of the film lacks special features but still looks good on Blu Ray. I only wish more movies like this would come out with a blu ray version. I love the 80's so take that into account when you consider this for your Blu Ray library.,1401408000,3,584,3.9159663865546217

And from what I read it sounded like a good film.

I decided to buy this Blu-Ray.

Kinda like when you go to the Video store back in the day. And find that classic film.

316524,5,6301133404,This was a simple but funny movie that we had on VHS tape recorded off TV. We have been looking for it for years and were pleased to find it on Amazon.,1368230400,,151,3.75
316525,5,6301133404,"I discovered this movie on cable quite by accident about 25 years ago and fell in love with it.  The quirky screenplay by Scott Frank ('Get Shorty', 'Little Man Tate') under the skilled and well-thought-out direction of Martha Coolidge ('Real Genius', 'Valley Girl') made for a tight, yet low-key and funny-as-all-get-out movie that stands head and shoulders above a lot of the other films of its day that seemed somehow to garner more unwarranted attention.

The cast, ranging from relative unknowns Arliss Howard and Suzy Amis to screen legend Robert Stack, do an astounding turn in this movie, neither taking themselves too seriously, nor poking fun at the source material.  As Martha Coolidge says about the film in her commentary, 'it's a good, fun romp!'  It's sad that this got lost in the shuffle during its theatrical release, but fortunately, it's now on Blu-Ray and DVD.

The transfer is very good (full-screen, unfortunately, but a very good one), the sound and picture are rich and full, and the only other things I would've liked for this disc to have would be either the 'director's cut' or at least some deleted scenes (which Ms Coolidge talks about in great detail), and an isolated soundtrack to hear the songs performed by The Knack.  Beggars cannot be choosers, especially ones as lucky to have a little-known film get not only a digital release, but also an insightful director's commentary, so please don't take that as a complaint.  This release could've had ~no~ bonus features and I would still own it on Blu-Ray.

Do yourself a favour and take a trip back to a better time.  It's well worth it.",1363219200,8,1620,4.840579710144928
316526,5,6301133404,"THE TRANSFER QUALITY FOR THIS MOVIE WHICH IT WAS MADE ON THE 80'S IS VERY, VERY GOOD,

THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD ALSO.

I WAITED A LONG, LONG TIME FOR PARAMOUNT PICTURES TO release THIS MOVIE ON DVD,
AND NOW IS HERE...

I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE PRICE TO GET CHEAPER, SO I BOUGHT IT THE SECOND DAY IT WAS release IN DVD.
ANY ONE WHO IS WILLING TO WAIT FOR A LOWER PRICE?... IT WILL BE A GOOD IDEA, BUT I REALLY
ADVISE TO ANY WHO HAS WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THE release OF THE MOVIE TO GET IT TODAY,
