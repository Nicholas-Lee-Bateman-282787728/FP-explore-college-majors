8738465,4,B017A7ECCM,Fascinating show. Too short. Wanted more on what was found and what it means.,1500681600,3,77,4.571428571428571
8738466,2,B017A7ECCM,I was a bit disappointed.  Having read the Preston book my expectations were high.  It seemed more like PR for Elkins.  Also the audio and video were not synced - spoken word way off front eh speaking.,1497484800,3,201,4.378378378378378
8738467,5,B017A7ECCM,I purchased this to go with the future Preston book by the same title.  It was interesting - wished it had been longer.,1482192000,5,119,4.173913043478261
