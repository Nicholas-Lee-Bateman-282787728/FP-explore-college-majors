7090405,5,B00VHAG1O6,"BOTTOM LINE: THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT is what popcorn monster movies are all about!  It's exciting, scary, funny, sad, thought-provoking (though not TOO much), and most of all... FUN!!! Blu-ray remaster is a great one, bringing strong picture with tons of lost detail back in focus. Solid soundmix, too. Very highly recommended! 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains major spoilers): In the year 1916, during the early days of World War I, a British freighter crossing the Atlantic is torpedoed by a German U-boat. A handful of survivors manage to escape the doomed ship aboard a sturdy but under supplied lifeboat. With only enough rations & drinking water to last a week, things look pretty grim. Just then the sub which sank them surfaces nearby, to recharge her batteries. The lifeboat's occupants take a desperate ""what have we got to lose?"" gamble to sneak on board the sub and turn the tables on her crew. Fortunately for the British sailors, a lone American among them, (Doug McClure, as the improbably named Bowen Tyler), understands the U-boat's intricate workings, thanks to his ship-building father. In a bold, violent clash, Bowen and the British sailors successfully surprise the Germans and hijack their vessel, setting it on a course for America. Their success is short-lived however, as the crafty Germans regain control again, reversing course back to Germany... only to lose the ship once more to Bowen and his friends. By this point, the U-boat is almost out of fuel and her food stores are nearing depletion, so a truce of sorts is finally reached. Everyone agrees to work together in order to reach a neutral American port. But unbeknownst to anyone aboard, the treacherous German executive officer tampers with the sub's compass, sending them all on a direct southerly course instead. Limping along on the last of their supplies, the sub & her crew chance upon the fabled antarctic continent of Caprona. Surrounded by a craggy, cliff-bound coastline, Caprona offers no harbor in which to make port. The exit of a sub-surface river is spotted by chance and, in a hair-raising sequence, the battered U-boat is craftily guided thru the narrow channel by Bowen Tyler, like thread thru the eye of the proverbial needle. What awaits them all on the other side of the treacherous waterway is perhaps the world's largest extinct volcanic crater. Incredibly, heat rising from vents in the crater floor has kept the temperature inside sub-topical. Most amazing of all, however, is that Caprona is a self-contained world from pre-history. Every era of our planet is represented: from the age of one-celled organisms thru the time of the mighty dinosaurs, right up to primitive Cro-Magnon man. Can these hardy but haggard soldiers & sailors survive in such an utterly alien, unthinkably inhospitable, kill-or-be-killed environment long enough to figure out a means to replenish their exhausted supplies ...and escape??

THOUGHTS: After years of waiting (and wanting), one of my very favorite sci-fi action-adventure films makes a spectacular splash onto Blu-ray! Pure escapist entertainment that's perfectly suitable for kids of all ages. Star Doug McClure is the manliest man's man here, leading the ragtag band of tired, angry, disheveled soldiers & civilians into the heart of a fantastic world, brimming with all manner of impossible dangers. John McEnery gives a layered, particularly good performance as U-boat captain Von Schoenvorts. His voice was (expertly) dubbed; apparently he sounded too British. Thankfully the guy who dubbed him doesn't stoop to using the cliched ""Vee haf vays oof making you tahk!"" voice. Anthony Ainley is necessarily cruel & crafty as second-in-command German executive officer, Deitz. The various actors in the smaller roles are equally good. Special mention to Bobby Parr, doing a marvelous job buried under some crude but serviceable make-up, as affable caveman ""Ahm,"" a member of the Botu tribe, the lowest of the three levels in the caveman hierarchy. Together, the ensemble cast of actors make for a very likable crew of misfits who have their work cut out for them. They must obtain sufficient food & potable water to replenish their strength AND restock the sub's stores. They must devise a method of refining enough crude oil, (discovered in a small pool a short distance inland from where they made landfall), to refill the empty diesel tanks of the U-Boat. But most important of all, these war-weary refugees, trapped in this frightening world of the far distant past, must remain ever-vigilant against the fantastical, senses-shocking threats posed by both horrific prehistoric monstrosities of all shapes & sizes and the savage tribes of cavemen, who lurk everywhere and regard these outsiders as mortal enemies to be conquered, captured and killed!

THE BLU-RAY: The good folks at Kino-Lorber have done the entire movie-loving world a huge favor by bringing us this beautifully remastered edition of THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT, in glorious high-definition. The color palette is lush and bold. The mid-tones, lights and darks are as they should be. Pixelation and artifacting are minimal. Picture clarity is razor-sharp, with only the tiniest amount of video noise enhancement to betray the age of the source prints from MGM's vaults. Seriously, you've NEVER seen this film looking better! Details lost in previous formats pop with stunning clarity here. For instance: the sequence in which the U-boat crew uses her deck gun to shell a pair of massive Styracosaurus which have cornered Bowen & Captain Von Schoenvorts. At the conclusion of the scene the male escapes while his mortally wounded mate collapses atop her nest of eggs. Thanks to the enhanced image of this new Blu-ray, for the first time I was able to see the single, solitary tear rolling down the dying dinosaur's bony face; something I had NEVER noticed until now. It added an entirely new layer of powerful emotion to a scene I had watched countless times before. Just amazing! Several such instances of never-before-seen detail can be found throughout this stunning Blu-ray presentation. The cinematography and shot compositions are even more impressive, most notably in the night time eruption sequence towards the end of the film; the yellow-orange-white glow from the lava beautifully back lights our hero and Lisa, his damsel in distress, (played by the lovely and spunky Susan Penhaligon), as they race to intercept the departing U-boat before it sails away forever. With regards to the audio portion of the disc, the sound is strong and level, thundering on a good speaker system. No hissing, pops, crackles or fading to be heard. In short, everything about this release is top shelf. It isn't 100% perfect, but this Kino-Lorber Blu-ray is literally worlds beyond those old VHS tapes, laser discs and DVDs in terms of sharp, accurate picture representation and sound quality & clarity. Sadly, the bonus features are pretty meager: a copy of the film's theatrical trailer and a moderated full-length audio commentary track with director Kevin Conner. Even so, the terrific audio & video quality of this Blu-ray edition of THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT alone ensure that it rates a wildly enthusiastic 5 STARS from this big Dino vs Man fan!!!",1437177600,5,7260,5.129222972972973

7090407,5,B00VHAG1O6,"Kino Lorber impressed me with their Blu of ""Land""! It is a radical improvement over the DVD, very clean transfer. The audio commentary featuring Kevin O'Connor is full of interesting bits about the production. Best of all there is a sweet surprise that I heard no mention of prior to the release: a ""making of"" featurette from the time of the film's release, featuring some priceless footage of making the film. The only thing I feel this edition is lacking: it would have been nice to get a double-feature with ""The People That Time Forgot"", just like MGM did with one of the DVD editions. I fear that, unless ""Land"" sells a lot of copies, we may never see ""People"" on Blu.",1435017600,8,674,4.532786885245901
7090408,4,B00VHAG1O6,"When I reviews ""At the Earth's Core"" I expressed a hope that ""Land That Time Forgot"" would come to blu-ray and here it is! It's a similar 70's fantasy/sci-fi adventure movie with a less cheesy feel and more dramatic edge. German and British Navy men team up with an American couple to survive when they all arrive starving and out of fuel on a forgotten dinosaur island. Tensions rise, both with the local neanderthals and between each other, and it all builds to a shocking ending you won't see coming. Movies like this aren't made anymore and if you're like me and collect classic fantasy movies you won't be let down here, it's a classic.

The blu-ray comes alone packaged in a simple Viva Elite case with reversible cover-art. On the flip-side is the more classic movie poster with orange lettering, which I ended up using. The video quality looks great for this kind of film and is a massive step up from the DVD. A lot of fantastic spooky jungle imagery and colorful effects fill the movie and they all look vibrant and detailed in HD with no overly aggressive processing. The soundtrack is a lossless DTS MA mono track with very little in the way of popping or hissing; It sounds clean and packs a good punch.

Special features are more limited this time around, lacking the in-depth interviews with director and cast from Earth's Core. Included is a vintage featurette with some nice behind-the-scenes footage and concept art (look for Derrick Meddings, who you might know from the James Bond documentaries as a miniatures effects man). There is also another commentary with the same director, who again keeps things conversational and informative and I enjoyed his commentary.

All in all ""Land That Time Forgot"" is a pleasure on blu-ray. Great 70's adventure with a more serious edge this time but no less fun and filled with vintage effects, solid video and audio quality and a decent selection of features. It won't look like a modern ""Jurassic World,"" but if you're a fan of these types of films I don't think you can go wrong here.",1435017600,23,2045,4.706703910614525

7090422,4,B00VHAG1O6,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of the Land That Time Forgot that was issued in 2015.

BLU-RAY - The print is good but not excellent. You can see a lot of details and it's always good to get a better version of what existed before so we can be thankful for that.

EXTRA's - The extra's consist of a commentary track by the director and the original trailer. While it is always nice to have the director's comments for a commentary track, on this occasion I would have preferred someone else. The commentary is not very good and at times boring. The director, Kevin Connor is aging and he doesn't add a lot. He talks a lot about what you can see on screen and is obvious.

PLOT -  The movie starts with a mysterious message in a bottle being thrown from somewhere unknown and is found and read at a shore unknown. Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure), Lisa Clayton (Susan Penhaligon) along with a bunch of English Sailors are stranded in life boat's after their passenger ship is torpedoed by a German U-Boat in 1916 during World War I. By chance, the U-Boat surfaces and all members of the life boat force the German's too submit and it is taken over by them. Fortunately for them, Bowen is a submarine designer and knows how to run the ship! They go back and forth taking control of the ship until the English side manages to torpedo the U-Boat supply ship thereby leaving them stranded near Antarctica with no food or supplies. Fortunately for them they happen to be near a 200 mile long mysterious island called Caprona. Caprona has no port but thanks to the eagle eyes of the German captain they see a cave that appears to have warm water exiting it. They have nothing better to do so they enter it. Soon after entering they find out that they are in a land that is not only warm but has dinosaurs. Time seems to have stood still here for millions of years. This solves the food problem but still leaves them stranded. They soon encounter Cave Men which we all know did not exist during the time of the dinosaurs. One of them, Ahm, seems to indicate that he knows where there is oil. Thanks in no small part to know it all, Lisa Clayton, they soon figure out that life on the island becomes more advanced the farther north you travel. Apparently life evolves rather quickly too, as our friendly caveman Ahm of the Bolu tribe is ready to be welcomed to the Sto-lu, the next evolutionary step up. This progress occurs throughout their lives. The German's and the English agree to a truce until they can get off the island and get to a neutral port. They work together to get oil. In the meantime Bowen and company hunt for food and have to travel ever north to find it. Eventually a volcano erupts and tensions come to a boiling point amongst all. The movie has a somewhat surprising sober conclusion and you get to find out the meaning of that message in a bottle that the movie opens with.

PRODUCTION - This movie was produced by Amicus Productions for American International Pictures (AIP.) It is the first of 3 Edgar Rice Burrough's movies made by AIP. The other two were 'The People that Time Forgot' and 'At the Earth's Core.' All were made by the same director, Kevin Conner. This movie, in my opinion, is the best of the three. Amicus is best known for it's horror anthologies and for being the main rival of Hammer Studios. At the time this movies was made, Hammer was effectively out of business and Amicus decided to try something new. The budgets were rather small and the special effects are, today, critically panned. Though at the time they really weren't that bad. I didn't think so when I originally saw the movies. Of course by today's standards they are not good. I felt 'At the Earth's Core' had the poorest effects of the 3 movies.
The movie stars veteran actor Doug McClure who is most famous for his run on 'The Virginian' television series. Though he starred in many movies and television movies and episodes.

I felt that too much time was spent getting to the 'Land.' Basically half the movie is spent out in and around the U-Boat. However, that time was not boring so it doesn't detract from the movie. It just takes away from the time spent with the Dinosaurs and other creatures. Lisa Clayton, is just too smart of a scientist. She jumps to a lot of conclusions quickly and seems to know everything, no matter how confusing, that Ahm, the caveman, is trying to tell them. Though I can't fault the movie too much. It's not like we want to waste time learning how to communicate with a caveman.

As a side note, there was at least one confusing moment during the movie. Toward the end after the U-Boat captain is shot on top of the U-Boat. A little while later he is seen in his room playing chess and confused about what is going on outside. I'm not sure what happened here. Perhaps, the scene where he is shot was originally meant to be a little while before the climax. Another gaff occurs when Ahm attacks Bowen, Bowen already has a bloody head before he attacks and yet points to his head after Ahm attacks him indicating that is where he was just struck. I'm sure budgetary constraints were behind these scenes.

Recommended for fans of older adventure fantasy movies and obviously Edgar Rice Burrough's fans.",1461542400,,5242,4.481675392670157
7090423,5,B00VHAG1O6,"Just finished watching ""The Land That Time Forgot"" released by 20th Century Fox.
I remember Mom and Dad going to see this movie on one of their infrequent date nights when it was first released by in 1974 in movie theaters.  Both enjoyed it very much; and I do remember seeing bits and pieces of it on television throughout the years.  So it was finally nice to watch the entire movie from start-to-finish in what Jeff H. refers to as ""The Secret Cinema"" - my living room and my high definition 42-inch, 3-D television.
Based on the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same title, ""The Land That Time Forgot"" is a timeless and epic lost continent adventure where a team of American and English sailors and passengers find themselves castaway on the sea due to the actions of a German submarine that torpedoed their ship.
By a bit of blind chance and luck, the sailors manage to overcome the submarine's crew when they surface to recharge their batteries; but sabotage by the submarine captain find them hopelessly lost  and in desperation, the two crews must join together and fight for survival when they have only one chance for survival on a lost continent that is home to dinosaurs and savage humans.
""The Land That Time Forgot"" has aged very well and tells an epic and haunting story of survival in a strange, wild land.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
FIVE STARS!",1460246400,5,1363,4.670833333333333
7090424,4,B00VHAG1O6,"I love old cheesy movies.  This definitely fills that category.  The ""special effects"" are hilarious.  Clay-looking creatures, scenes where you can see the strings attached to monsters/dinosaurs, etc.  Overall though, these type of movies are great.  I grew up watching them with my dad, and they bring me back to my childhood.  The stories are fun, the characters are very dramatic yet likable, and this movie would be AWESOME if remade now.

Now that it has been a little over thirty-five years since I first watched it and I am now almost forty years old, I have to say that I still love this film. Yes, it is very cheesy looking and hasn't aged very well because of that fact, but the film is very close to the source material (which I have read, btw.) and it has a very good cast.

7090427,4,B00VHAG1O6,"American International Pictures (AIP) and Samuel Arkoff knew how to sell a film. Prior to the 1975 release of ""The Land That Time Forgot,"" there was a comic book (which I still own), an extraordinary trailer and that unforgettable movie poster. I stared at that movie poster a long time and I couldn't wait to see it at the neighborhood theater. Take a long look at that poster (on the cover of the Blu-ray release), colorful, rugged, fire and brimstone, with quite a bit of detail that doesn't even remotely happen in the film. No matter, I was waiting in line with the other kids the weekend it opened.

""The Land That Time Forgot"" was a British production released in the U.S. by AIP/Arkoff. It did great box office, inspiring a series of fantasy adventure films including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/At-the-Earth-s-Core-Blu-ray/dp/B00OZ8XH7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">At the Earth's Core [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warlords-of-Atlantis-DVD-1978/dp/B0086TW1KE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warlords of Atlantis [DVD] [1978</a>] and the sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-People-That-Time-Forgot/dp/B00005O073/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The People That Time Forgot</a>, all directed by Kevin Connor with similar casts. As much as I hate to say it, none of these films were particularly good with poor FX, a flood of miniature planes and boats, irritating formality and the always intrusive British, oh-so-loud musical score (a trademark of Hammer Horror Films as well).

But it's as much fun as I ever had at the theater in the era of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-the-Lost-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001SGN1JM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of the Lost: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valley-Of-The-Dinosaurs-SSN-1-2-Disc-Set/dp/B004TPJML0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valley Of The Dinosaurs: SSN 1 (2 Disc Set)</a>. Doug McClure was the lone American in these productions, a likable actor best known for his TV work. He was a peculiar choice, though one suspects the price was right. In ""The Land That Time Forgot,"" based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Land-that-Time-Forgot/dp/1468110780/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Land that Time Forgot</a>), he plays Bowen Tyler, a man forced into the ocean during World War I when a German submarine torpedoes his ship. With a few British mates, they hijack the sub and for the opening 30 minutes, essentially wage strategic war for control of the vessel.

As luck would have it, they become lost in the Arctic and stumble upon the forgotten island of Caprona. What they discover is an isolated ecosystem ruled by dinosaurs and tribes of Neanderthal cavemen. The action is sporadic, but they find time to battle lizards, rubber T-Rex's and the stiffest Pterodactyl in cinema history. Oh yes, they have to dodge a few caveman spears as well.

""The Land That Time Forgot"" is a film kids would love. But considering this era of ""Jurassic Park,"" the kids would have to be very, very young. I love fantasy films taking place during the early industrial age, made so popular by such works as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island-at-the-Top-of-the-World-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0001I55XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island at the Top of the World (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-s-20-000-Leagues-Under-The-Sea-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JKU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-to-the-Center-of-the-Earth/dp/B00007JMD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>. ""The Land That Time Forgot"" is not on the same level of quality, and one could argue it's practically forgotten today. But it's a remnant of a more innocent time when AIP/Arkoff (and New World Pictures and Roger Corman) could sell you a film based on the movie poster alone.

7090438,4,B00VHAG1O6,"""The Land That Time Forgot""(1974) is directed by Kevin Connor (At the Earth's Core, Warlords of Atlantis). The story is about a German U-boat which is taken over by some British and American passengers that goes off coarse in the south seas and by chance comes across a lost continent which contains life once thought extinct. Based on the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs this action film takes us into a land of dinosaurs, prehistoric men, and volcanic lands with pre-computer generated special effects which often includes miniature sets and puppetry.

The blu-ray looks okay, though it doesn't appear to have been remastered as there are many instances of dust, and dirt on the image. There is also an old 12 minute documentary about the making of the film as well as audio commentary by the director.",1438905600,2,802,4.854014598540146

They were even kind of silly back in the day, but...we loved these ERB gifts from the Brits back in the Seventies. Its got dash, style, good characters, and even a higher evolved Chaka. Recent films in fantastic realms (excepting LOTR) have lavish budgets, hundreds of special effects techies, and yet no soul. McClure seemed a curious choice even to this American viewer, but he's a two-fisted Burroughs hero up for the challenge. This kind of hero, as in At the Earth's Core and Patrick Wayne's People That Time Forgot, doesn't get flustered and always keep a stiff upper lip no matter how many troglodytes are swarming into them. Bravo for getting two of these on bluray and lets hope PTTF is not far behind.
I've learned to read reviews on  bluray releases before picking them over DVD. I'm no expert but I'm happy with this release in both quality and price.",1437868800,,965,4.676470588235294

8710161,4,B00VHAG1O6,"A childhood favorite is brought to vibrant life on this really great looking digital remaster that is sharp, vibrant and preserves the original aspect ratio of it's theatrical release, which I saw as a kid. As for the movie itself...

The Land That Time Forgot is a beloved childhood favorite of mine. Its a cheezy but fun prehistoric lost world pic based on a great story by the legendary Edgar Rice Burroughs. Survivors of a ship sunk by a German U-boat in WWI take over that same sub, but due to sabotage, sub and crew become lost at sea. They find themselves in the Antarctic and an underwater channel leads them to a hidden prehistoric lost world where they now must fight together to survive against giant carnivores of all shapes and sizes and tribes of savage cave people.

Land can be thoroughly enjoyed now as a camp classic from the pre-Jurrasic Park days when dinosaurs were rubber puppets and every movie ended with an erupting volcano. Kevin Connor directs with just the right blend of seriousness and old fashioned charm and the cast, including Doug McClure as Bowen Tyler and the adorable Susan Penhaligon as Lisa Clayton, play their roles straight enough to get us to follow along despite all the table top models and rubber beasties. The SPFX may be cheesy as can be, but the flick has its heart in the right place. A very fun flick and a great Saturday night viewing with some of your favorite beverages. A rubber monster blast and a lot of cheesy fun! The type of flick they just don't make anymore!",1515801600,,1519,4.601476014760148

8710165,4,B00VHAG1O6,"Released in 1974 and directed by Kevin Connor, The Land that Time Forgot is an adventure flick based on Edgar Rice Burroughs book: A German sub during WWI sinks a British ship, but some survivors commandeer the U-boat whereupon there are tensions amidst the two factions. After taking a wrong turn, the sub comes to an unknown land, which they discover is Caprona, a land where dinosaurs and primitive people dwell. Can they ever get back to civilization?

John McEnery plays Captain Von Schoenvorts while the English girl, Lisa, is played by cutie Susan Penhaligon, a biologist. The two have an interesting discussion over the German conduct in the Great War. Lisa observes that Von Schoenvorts is a sophisticated, respectable man, which sparks her to inquire of his brutal war actions.  The Captains Germanic contention is that Lisa is naive considering that ""life is founded upon killing and destruction"" and ""the sea is teeming with living things that prey upon one another to survive."" Say what you will about the dinosaur puppets, but this is some pretty heavy stuff for an adventure flick appealing mostly to youths. The Captains second in command, Dietz (Anthony Ainley), more fits the stereotype that Lisa projects on Von Schoenvorts. Actually, the Captain is the wise father figure.

The British are portrayed in a diplomatic, pragmatic manner (Keith Barron, amongst others). But its the American, Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure), whos the brash, masculine hero. Hes essentially boorish but Lisa cant help but be attracted to him even while she has more mental affinity with Von Schoenvorts, the suave, but maybe-too-old sophisticate.

This was a British production and the dubious dinosaur effects are noticeably inferior to Hammers stop-motion effects used in 1966s One Million Years BC. But if you can embrace their quaintness or ignore their cheesiness, The Land that Time Forgot is a surprisingly decent adventure, almost in the same league as 1954s 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, at least as far as ship-going adventure and worthy mindfood go; plus it lacks the hokey Disney-isms of that movie.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot at Canary Islands and Scotland with studio work done in England.
