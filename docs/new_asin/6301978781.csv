Hmm...maybe Air Programs International thought it was running out of classic tales to animate for their TV audience when they picked this one... hard to say, but it wasn't an inspired choice. It's not that this 1970's TV special was bad--just maybe a little too earnest. This quasi-biographical cartoon, shown originally on CBS as part of their holiday oriented ""Famous Classic Tales"" specials, just doesn't have any villains nearly as interesting as Long John Silver of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Perhaps that's the reason they never used a historical character again.

This 60 minute program is worth seeing if you remember those old specials and have some nostalgia for them. Maybe some of today's kids would enjoy it--if they haven't been raised on a diet of video games and flashy Japanese anime. If you're a collector of the old API cartoons and you find a copy of this show, hang on to it. It's a rare bird. MGM/UA released it on video tape in the mid 1980's and it has been out of print since then. While others in the CBS Famous Classic Tales series are out on DVD, Marco Polo isn't one of them.",1131148800,,1209,4.676056338028169
