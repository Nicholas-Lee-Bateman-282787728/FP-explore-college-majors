2318480,3,B0009TILEO,we paid a lot for this tape ($39 was best price) considering the age of the IMAX film. It was not the show we most remembered but well done for its time. Not worth the money we paid however considering more modern flying media available today. Maybe a collector item?,1284076800,,267,4.36
2318481,5,B0009TILEO,Was able to just get this from a Gentleman in England through EBAY for 15 on laser disk. Watched it with my son on HD. The memories came rushing back and STILL loved the movie. Kid loves to fly now... Wish this came out on BlueRay. Would be another Hot seller...,1278720000,,262,4.1568627450980395
2318482,5,B0009TILEO,"I first saw this when I worked for the summer at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio back in the late '70's.  They had an IMAX theater and I saw it about 24 times thoughout the summer.  A bunch of us would go in to see it every chance we got. We loved it. I saw it again a few years later on a vacation to Washington, DC.  The music soundtrack to it isn't bad either!",1269388800,2,361,3.7866666666666666
2318483,5,B0009TILEO,"This is such a fantastic film that I copied it to my PC to burn my own DVD before I got rid of my VHS system.  I use my multimedia projector to put it on my wall, about 8 feet wide.  Still, the IMAX projection in the Air and Space Museum gives us the most breathtaking view, the only view that does the film justice.",1241395200,5,316,3.8461538461538463
2318484,5,B0009TILEO,"Fabulous movie for anyone remotely interested in aviation, as I was when I watched it years ago (about ten times!), but the movie inspired me to make a career as a pilot (and other aspects of aviation), which I have done.

Sure would be nice to have a DVD!",1170633600,4,256,4.224489795918367
2318485,5,B0009TILEO,"I'm with you... historical and great movie... don't know if/why not on dvd... but, you can go to the air and space museum in washington DC and it plays twice daily.",1151107200,6,164,4.32258064516129
2318486,5,B0009TILEO,This is the first IMAX movie I saw and is still my favorite. The scenery is breath-taking. Can somebody tell me why this isn't on DVD?,1138406400,11,134,4.1923076923076925
8066435,5,B0009TILEO,"I bought this for my husband when it came out from the Smithsonian after we had seen it in IMAX. It is still magnificent. It is best seen on a large scree. At the time we had a projection TV that we had retrieved from a bar. It had a 6 foot log screen ( not diagonal.).

I wish they would re-master and release it in new formats for our big screen. Also the sound is beautiful but I am sure it would be better re-mastered.

If you have a chance to buy this used, you will not be sorry.

From hot air balloons where you feel like you are in the basket to jet fighters, you will be spellbound.",1517702400,,591,3.908333333333333
8066436,5,B0009TILEO,"Just to clarify, this movie was also released on Laser Disc. Not just VHS. The Laser Disc version is extremely rare, but it does occasionally appear on online auctions.
The quality of the Laser Disc is not really that good. It looks like a bad transfer onto the disc, not much better than the VHS version of the movie.

To Fly! was only released on VHS and Laser Disc, and no other formats. It can still be seen at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in DC. It's shown at an IMAX theater which is located inside the museum itself.

I would highly recommend this movie. The visuals are phenomenal, and the music score is incredible.",1504051200,,641,4.47008547008547
8066437,5,B0009TILEO,"I didn't purchase the movie from here, but I wanted to express my thoughts and feelings for the movie ""To Fly""!!  I last saw ""To Fly"" at the Air and Space Museum Imax theater in Washington DC, twice in a row with my Dad in 1986, celebrating its 10th anniversary!  Awesome!!  Awesome!!  No question about it, one of the most incredible and moving documentaries I've ever seen and of course, any movie that you see at the Imax theater, will always be very memorable!!  I Love how the movie was put together through the history of flight, from the early years, modern times and to the future and the music is just inspiring!!  We ended up buying the VHS at the Air & Space Museum store and I still have it to this day loving it every time I watch it, bringing back memories and continue to love my dreams of flying!!  To Fly, ranks beyond the 5 stars!!  Happy 40th anniversary ""To Fly!!""",1484611200,,884,4.347560975609756
8066438,5,B0009TILEO,"I remember seeing this at the Air and Space Museum when it premiered back in 1976 (I was 8).  It had a profound impact on me back then, and I can still feel that plop! of my stomach as the Niagara River plunged away below me.  It's a sensation I have never forgotten.",1468368000,,267,4.018867924528302
8066439,4,B0009TILEO,"This is a VHS version, there were no such things as DVD's when this movie came out, I remember it from when cedar point showed it on the big imax screen. Just wish it was on Hi def dvd.",1461888000,,185,3.769230769230769
8066440,5,B0009TILEO,"The very first IMAX movie I ever watched. Enjoyed it in the IMAX at Gurnee IL Marriott's Great America (Now Six Flags). Not the clarity of a DVD, but still amazing to watch on my home projection system with a 9 foot screen and sound system to match.",1448928000,,249,4.208333333333333
8066441,4,B0009TILEO,"Great visuals! The story about how aviation helped grow our nation, while it's self, growing the same time is great as well. Sure could use a ""digital"" upgrade though. A blu-ray version would be wonderful.",1383436800,3,205,4.885714285714286
8066442,4,B0009TILEO,"Well...I ALMOST bought it..till I saw the reviews about it on VHS.  I saw it in the 1970s at the first IMAX theater in Las Vegas (Caesar's Palace) and the balloon scene is very thrilling when it goes over the canyon wall.  When the plane was flying along the California Coast people would actually lean in their seats at the theater.  If it ever came out in Blue Ray (like Jaws has!!!) I get one for sure and show it to high school students in US History classes.  I do plan to show Jaws (Blue Ray is like looking through a window for thsi movie!) this year since this movie had such an impact on society for several years in the 70s.  Probably the second most influential movie (economic-wise), second only to The China Syndrome.",1364515200,,730,4.377777777777778
8066443,4,B0009TILEO,"To Fly is  an important and entertaining (though only 27 minutes long) documentary of the history and future of flight, themed to the opening of the National Air and Space Museum and also to the bicentennial celebration.
I used to attend this movie about once a month when the Air and Space Museum opened on the Mall in 1976. I understand it is still shown there today. The recorded ""walk-in"" music played was the Pachelbel Canon in D Major - a beautiful meditation before the opening of the film which also enhanced my appreciation of the film.
Good news: the original images are all there, but the bad news is that the original IMAX effects are not reproduced well or sometimes at all in this format. For example in the IMAX presentation, the opening scene is of the gondola of a helium balloon in which the balloonist is giving an inspiring speech to a crowd in 18th century period dress in the lower part of the otherwise dark screen.
The speech concludes and the balloon's handling lines are released.
As the balloon rises, the image grows and pans up to the full 5 story height of the screen to show the sky and the entire balloon soaring above the New England countryside.
The music rises to a crescendo. and it takes your breath away. I was not alone in this - you could always hear the audience reacting with awe.
While the images are not lost in the VHS format, the effect certainly (and understandably) is reduced.
The sharpness of the picture and clarity and soundtrack reproduction are also not up to current technological standards, particularly for viewing on large screen TVs.
Regardless, I am not at all sorry I purchased this since this is the only consumer format currently available, and, living in California now, I rarely get to DC.  Not only does it introduce the concept of the Air and Space Museum and the importance of flight to the human psyche, but also pays tribute to the growth of our nation. It is a must see. Truly inspirational on many levels.
A Blue Ray version would definitely help to capture some of the truly splendid cinematography of the original and contribute to a heightened home movie experience. There is no CG employed.
I hope that someone can care enough and afford to reproduce this classic in Blue Ray, I will certainly purchase a copy. It will elevate it from merely stunning in the VHS format to absolutely thrilling in the more modern format.",1354752000,9,2395,4.632941176470588
8066444,5,B0009TILEO,"Very good, the content is forever fresh, but the VHS Tape media is a little old and few have players any more.  I wanted this to add to my collection.  I saw the original in iMAX the first week it cam out and I liked it then and still like it.  The movie is an inspirational overview of the history of flight.  Received this tape in new condition in its original ""shrink wrap""  delivery was fast good seller.",1323216000,2,408,4.17948717948718
