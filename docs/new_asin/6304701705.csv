930945,1,6304701705,"This is a spaghetti western with no sauce in it. Normally a western with Bronson and directed by Sturges would have been something to wet one's appetite. It is not so here. The movie  is dry and the pace is so slow. The production value is cheap. Despite the presence of an internationally popular star at that time, Bronson just could not carry this one. It amazes me that the director associated with films like The Magnificent Seven and The Gunfight at the OK Corral could come up with something bad as this one. But the trend was already there when he directed Joe Kidd with Clint Eastwood. That was bad. This was worse. The DVD picture is bad and hazy. It seems that this was taken from an old and badly copied VHS and transferred to DVD. Shades of the old MC Clintok DVD from Goodtime Video. Don't waste your money on this one. This is Bronson's worst movie.",1043107200,4,864,4.4
930946,3,6304701705,"Those seeking one of those ""spaghetti westerns"" which are filled with noise and violence and exaggerated flourishes will probably be disppointed in ""Chino."" It moves at a deliberate pace, keeps the action in check, and knows the virtue of silence. The result is an odd, understated movie that almost qualifies as a ""character study.""
Charles Bronson plays a loner who runs a small horse-farm in the waning days of the American frontier. He takes in a runaway boy as a helper, visits an Indian village on the verge of extinction, and engages in a hesitant courtship with the sister of a hostile landowner. That's about it for the plot which concludes in a somber, realistic fashion.
The by-play between Bronson and real-life wife Jill Ireland is mildly amusing, the scenery is attractive and well-photographed, and for those who like to see Bronson with his shirt off, there's a scene where he's hanged by the wrists and flogged across his bare back by one of the hostile landowner's hired men.",970790400,14,993,4.881656804733728

This is the situation that Chino finds himself. Set in the ""Old West"" where Natives still traversed the plains, Chino, an isolated individual from the perspective of the new social order but perfectly at home with his life on the plains as a horse breaker.

The horses in this movie are EXCELLENT!!  This western is less Hollywood than others I've seen; it tells a tale that includes the hardships, the ignorance, the racism/greed and vigilante justice so common to these difficult times.  As a study in human nature, the plot reveals basic struggles many a loner would need to endure to make it despite the poor odds.

The rough film quality adds to the character and unique charm of this movie.

931059,3,6304701705,"First, let's address the ""digitally remastered"" issue. Several reviewers seem to think that deals with the visual aspect and it actually refers to the audio. The print of this movie, even the instant video here, is quite poor. It's really chopped up and the instant video is obviously cut off of an old video. You even see the word ""Delta"" in the lower right corner of the screen every so often. So now you've been updated.
  As for the film itself, this is one of Bronson's more cerebral films. There is some action here and there to be sure, but this moves at a slower pace than most of his films. The production is European (French, Italian, Spanish) and most of the crew is from Italy so this has a very different feel than westerns produced in the U.S. Many people have said this is Bronson's spaghetti western. It's a shame the print here is not upgraded like the sound is because it's a very beautifully shot film. 3 1/2 stars for Chino.",1385769600,,944,4.4508670520231215

film, Chino reaches out to a boy who is looking to trade his labor for room and board.  The boy is afraid of Chino, but
he ultimately realizes that Chino is to be trusted.  Bronson is excellent at showing his tough and tender sides.  Later in
the film, Bronson falls in love with the sister of one of the town bosses, who is Mexican.  He doesn't want her to marry
Chino, and sabotages the wedding.  Instead of the girl showing up at the church for the wedding, bad guys beat up
Chino.  Chino thinks that the girl sold him out, rather than knowing that she was threatened by her bad guy brother not

931186,5,6304701705,"Oddly, no one person either here or elsewhere on the 'net gushed as I will, about the great shots of the horses, as well as the affectionate tone of Valdez's relationship with the horses. I enjoyed the film, was startled when I learned it was filmed in Almera, Spain (for a fistfull fewer dollars). I was convinced it was in Arizona or even the California Hills, scene of so many westerns.

I will pass over my opinion of the story and cast except to say that it was oddly convincing. I even thought that those Spaniards playing Cheyenne were actually Cheyenne. The electricity between Bronson and Mrs. Bronson was palpable, showing that there was a good marriage behind the cameras.

But, the scenes of the horses! Where do you see these scenes anywhere, especially in one place?
1) A head stallion driving off weaker or younger horses with his aggressive posture and biting mouth?
2) The full on running of a herd of horses in open pasture? (I was wondering what these breeds were, and I suspect both arabs and andulusians, but what doI know about spanish horses?)
3) the charming and entirely true scene of Valdez getting on top of the horse that bit him, and Valdez saying over and over, ""I guess that horse and me just don't like eac other.""
4) The absolutely georgeous stallion making his cameos
5) The birthing of the foal and the cute part it played
6) The bareback riding of the Indians and their charge toward Chino
7) The way the boy, or his stand in, rode Black, the horse that Chino gave him at the end of the film
8) The great scene of Chino driving some horses to the town. THAT was a difficult scene to shoot, is very rare in our day, and whoever the wrangler was that did that was really competent. I do not think it was just an old stock shot left to the editor to stick in...to authentic.

Even though it is regrettable that the VHS/DVD versions cannot show the wide horse shots, I can only imagine how these lovely creatures would look on a large, 35 mm screen.

The film is much better than its detractors would have you believe, especially the way it was shot. If you are a Tough-Guy Bronson fan, you won't be disappointed, except that this is a tough guy Bronson who doesn't win every confrontation and shoot out.

Rather touching, in certain ways. Get it and look at the horses.

FIRST, let's get this out of the way. I owned a VHS. But the video and sound quality were atrocious. I gave it away to a friend who is a Bronson fan.

The depiction of a plain, austere lifestyle is very real and neat. The scene of the boy getting his first knife - in most westerns, you'd think knives were a dime a dozen. NOPE. No manufacturing like today.

The horse scenes were incredible. Lots of longs shots in canyons, wide open country, corrals.

The theme song is very pretty - but again, the sound quality is sh! t.

7877820,5,6304701705,"Although an Italian/Spanish/French production and shot in Spain, ""Chino"" (1973) isn't a genuine Spaghetti Western on account of director, John Sturges (""Magnificent Seven"") being an American (although he didn't finish the film; Duilio Colett did). More Importantly, ""Chino"" lacks the typical comic book tone and one-dimensional/amoral protagonists of most Italian Westerns, e.g. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" On the contrary, ""Chino"" is ultra-realistic and features flesh & blood protagonists.

THE PLOT: Chino Valdez (Charles Bronson), a half-breed, runs a horse farm in the desert and is usually persecuted when he goes to town. A 15 year-old runaway named Jamie drops by and Chino decides to hire him. Meanwhile, a neighboring rancher is starting to fence-up the wilderness and Chino falls for his beautiful half-sister (Jill Ireland).

I stayed away from ""Chino"" all these years because I was told that it was a slow, lackluster and uneventful Bronson Western. Well, it might be sort of slow, since the story focuses on the characters and their drama, but it's not lackluster or uneventful. I was surprised at how good it is. The theme is the dying of the Old West and everything that went with it. Big time ranchers are moving in and fencing-off the land and Native Americans are becoming extinct across the landscape, except for Reservations. Being a half-breed, Chino seems to stir-up trouble wherever he goes through no fault of his own, which results in a saloon fight here and there. Thankfully, Jamie is too young to be bigoted and they develop a sort of father/son relationship.

If you enjoy horses you'll love ""Chino."" It features the running of a herd in open pasture, cameos of a magnificent stallion, the birthing of a foal and its life with Chino & Jamie, the bareback riding of a group of Natives, Chino's great drive of some horses into town and an unexpected horse mating scene. Fittingly, that last one is the set-up for Chino making the moves on his woman, lol.

There's also a fairly long Native American sequence where Chino introduces Jamie to the band of Indians that are basically his family. There's a sleeping-in-the-tepee scene that's reminiscent of a similar scene in ""Dances with Wolves,"" which came out 17 years later. Also, as Chino entertains the idea of hooking-up with a sexy squaw Jamies meets a sweet young thang.

Unfortunately the story didn't end the way I would've liked it to end; it left a sour taste. But then I reflected on the movie and accepted it. In view of the film's main theme -- the twilight of the Old West -- I suppose it ended the way it had to. Besides, not every story ends on a ""everyone lived happily ever after"" note.

In any event, ""Chino"" breaches the ceiling of greatness as a simple, yet compelling drama that takes place in the soon-to-be-gone Old West.

The film runs 98 minutes.
