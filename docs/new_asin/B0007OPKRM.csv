2224563,5,B0007OPKRM,"This music DVD is amazing. I've never seen anything like it especially because it's a charity. It's certainly one that touches your soul. I can't stop watching it. I'm a mamber of a gospel choir which is another reason why it appeals to me. Their moves are great. The children are very professional. They make me cry, and certainly remind me of the problems in Africa. They also remind me of a friend I have in Uganda, and an aid song my Gospel Choir created called Song for Africa. I came across the children on YouTube while setting up our song. It arrived really quickly too, good job Amazon. God bless them.",1193356800,2,611,4.464285714285714

2224566,5,B0007OPKRM,It is amazing how in a cruel world young children can be given a chance to fly across the World to sing beautiful gospel music and combine English gospel music with African gospel music. This is an eye opener with moving bonus material explaining the suffering of similar orphans which the charity is trying to help. Promote this charity by buying this excellent dvd. I believe this is an encouragement to all Christians and even non-Christians who are concerned for the World's poor. Also in addition you can listen to excellent music!,1128729600,15,536,4.836956521739131

8049699,5,B0007OPKRM,"These children are precious and their devotion to God is evident. My family was so blessed to see the Choir's live performance in March 2009 at our church. The music is uplifting, with a soul-touching reverance. We have the Choir's DVD and several of the CDs; we rate them all at 5 STARS.

Each year, a new group of orphans has the opportunity to be in this choir and they tour for one year. Following their tour, they are guaranteed a top-quality education by the organization, all the way through their university years.

It is humbling to see these children doing God's work to make life better for themselves and other orphans in their homeland. Proceeds from these tours and the sale of African Children's Choir merchandise currently support nearly 8,000 children in more than 35 schools throughout Uganda, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Sudan.

8049700,4,B0007OPKRM,"The African Children's Choir recently performed at my church, and I was so impressed that I felt compelled to take them home with me (so to speak).  I went to Amazon.com and found this DVD ""Teach me to Dance"".  This video is absolutely marvelous.  In fact, I haven't had possession of the DVD pretty much since I received it, because friends and co-workers keep wanting to take it home and watch it themselves.  It is wonderful!",1219622400,6,428,4.592105263157895
