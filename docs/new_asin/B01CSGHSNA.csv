7689334,2,B01CSGHSNA,nowhere near as good as season 1. Boring in fact with depressing main leads and same goes for environment. I come from south wales and we have a cottage I St Davids and this area is far from what is depicted. I CERTAINLY HOPE THEY DO NOT WASTE THEIR MONEY ON ANOTHETR SERIES.,1480636800,,275,4.2075471698113205
7689335,5,B01CSGHSNA,An excellent series.  Love the characters in rural Wales.,1472515200,,57,5.333333333333333
7689336,5,B01CSGHSNA,"A wonderful series with intriguing mysteries, where victims, perpetrators and police alike are flawed, sympathetic characters. An interesting counterpoint to the times we are living in now. The main detective, Tom Mathias is so complex, watching him work is riveting. Can't wait for series 3!",1469232000,6,292,5.511111111111111
7689337,1,B01CSGHSNA,"We both enjoyed Season 1 but if you need subtitles in English (or any other language), this one is not for you.  Amazon lists it with subtitles but it arrived and the box said;  Part English subtitles.  When we started viewing it, there were absolutely no subtitles whatsoever.  Returned it.

Wish Amazon would correct their DVD details.  Maybe they'll come out with a later release and give us the subtitles.",1466121600,5,409,4.771428571428571

8754089,1,B01CSGHSNA,"Description states that the edition contains English and Welsh language with English subtitles for the Welsh language only. Instead, my daughter received a DVD set with only the English version, which is not what she wanted.",1514073600,,224,5.25
8754090,4,B01CSGHSNA,"Beginning in 2014 and running for three seasons, HINTERLANDor Y GWYLL in Welsh, meaning THE DUSKis a police drama set in Wales and is the first BBC series to be filmed in both English and Welsh. In the English versions, the accents are extremely rich, and that can be a problem: subtitles are recommended.

In a general sense, the series follows DCI Tom Mathias (Richard Harrington), who has been transferred from London to Wales apparently against his will and due to an unspecified situation. The first season implies this transfer has something to do with the photograph of two little girls he often looks atand the mystery of that particular storyline is clarified in season two. There is, however, a further overarching storyline that seems to involve Chief Superintendent Brian Prosser (Aneirin Hughes) and a local drunkand that continues to playout through the second season without any conclusion.

Children and parent-child relationships are an ouch line for both Mathias and his immediate subordinate Detective Inspector Mared Rhys (Mali Harries), and not surprisingly children and parent-child relationships figure prominently in most of the episodes. Season two includes five titles, with each title presented in two chapters.

In In the Dead of Night, Mathias finds himself under investigation by the IPCC (internal investigations) re the conclusion of the previous The Girl In The Waterand investigating an arson case that has put a mother and child in the hospital, the child near death. In Ceredigion, the IPCC investigation continues even while Mathias receives a crisis-laden visit from his wife, from whom it transpires he is separated, while he investigates the unexpected murder of a seemingly unremarkable bus driver, found near the abandoned bus with a hole in his head.

The Tale of Nant Gwrtheyrn echoes Alfred Hitchcocks PSYCHO in the story of the murder of a local notable that unexpected crosses with the strange story of a dead woman, her unsocialized son, and the long forgotten case of a missing child. Dark River also focuses on a parent-child relationship; when the body of an unidentified young woman is found in a school teachers car, the trail leads back to her father, a retired schoolmaster, and Mathias and his team must rush to find the missing teacher before the worst occurs.  In The Sound of Souls, Mathias investigates a burned body only to find himself embroiled in family feuds and a decade old murder case.

As in season one, HINTERLAND might be described as a mixture of police procedural and noir with an emphasis on the latter, and the tone remains significantly dark. As the episodes progress, however, Mathias seems to achieve a degree of personal stability he lacked in the previous season; the feel of the series never becomes light, but the change allows a sense of breathing room that didn't exist in season one. The cast is superior, with Mali Harries, Alex Harries, Hannah Daniel, and Aneirin Hughes delivering strong support as Mathais team and superior officer. Recommended, but if you are looking for a witty mystery series akin to MIDSOMER MURDERS (a personal favorite), you're in the wrong place.

8754092,5,B01CSGHSNA,"An excellent detective series. It will keep you in suspense. A very well written plot with excellent cast, and director. I only wish they were completely close captioned.",1504483200,,170,5.107142857142857
8754093,3,B01CSGHSNA,I love this show but season two has a lot of spoken Welch with practically illegible subtitles - this season doesn't have  available subtitles (other than when they are speaking Welch) for that reason alone it's not as good as the first season - the scenery is spectacular but I wouldn't want to live so far out in the boonies - no wonder people there are depressed - if subtitles were available it would be as good as season one,1485475200,,429,4.3625

8754096,4,B01CSGHSNA,"I really enjoy this crime drama, so glad I ran across it on Netflix! I find the cases and characters interesting, and the incredible beauty of the countryside is quite a counterpoint to the ugliness of the crimes people commit. Though, if I didn't know better, I'd never want to visit Wales after watching this - dark secrets and murderers lurking everywhere  Thank goodness I know better :)",1483833600,,391,4.75
