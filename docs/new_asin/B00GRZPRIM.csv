8626437,5,B00GRZPRIM,"Well produced short clips taken from other longer running films of Rudy's travels.  Liked the inclusion of extended performances.  If you have some of Maxa's longer running films don't bother - too much overlap, but as a ""taste"" this collection is a good choice.",1488326400,,262,4.931818181818182
8626438,4,B00GRZPRIM,"This is a compilation of several of Rudy's previously produced travel videos, so we had seen parts of this before. The parts that were new to us, which included the Canadian sections were very interesting and well done. The case indicates that it is a 5 hour length, but we could only locate three hours worth. We would like to see less time spent on food and beverage.",1454630400,3,369,4.4411764705882355
