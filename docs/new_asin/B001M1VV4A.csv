I bought the DVD (a bit pricey) to better utilize the practices in the text. The DVD isn't necessary,  but I've found it helpful.",1365033600,5,258,4.375

8320313,5,B001M1VV4A,"This is an awesome set of exercises on two dvd's, I think approximately 100 demonstrations well done. Since I have been doing them, they definately make me feel vibrant and healthier and I sincerely recommend this to every woman who wants to maintain a healthy life style. Donna Eden explains many pressure and meridian points to keep the energy flowing in your body and your energy field. For women who want to become pregnant there are techniques that can remove blockages which she says is one cause of infertility. There are also techniques to balance hormones, and for women going through menopause, including daily rountines, also to release fear and stress and to regain your energy when depleted. I do not have her book as a companion but she explains there are more details with the book such as information regarding women with endometriosis.",1323734400,10,852,4.923611111111111

8320315,5,B001M1VV4A,"Donna's DVDs are a gift. I started out by reading her books 'Energy Medicine' and 'Energy Medicine for Women'. I found them fascinating but I had some difficulty understanding all the explanations on how to do certain exercises. I looked her up in youtube and learned her famous 'five minute energy routine'. It was great. So easy. It made me feel great. No more stressed shoulders for me.

Then I bought this dvd set which focus on women issues and I highly recommend it.
You don't need to have the book to be able to practice the routines but the book is sooo complete. I love using both.",1267228800,19,590,4.462962962962963

Every page is enlightening and filled with ways to improve your health, both physically and emotionally. It should be a MUST for every woman who has ever felt ill, out of sorts and distressed in any way. I am now reading her other books and looking at her DVD's, this is just a great book for women! Start feeling better today and read this book then take five minutes a day a see the difference it can make in  your life.",1266537600,12,500,4.2631578947368425
8320317,5,B001M1VV4A,"Donna Eden does not believe being female is a disease.  Sensitive to the imbalances that often accompany the different stages of life, she developed a system of energy exercises which gently adjust the energy flow.

Touted as both a stand alone dvd as well as a companion to the book Energy Medicine for Women, this set of two dvds demonstrates the exercises contained in the book.  It is broken down into modules, including PMS, pregnancy and menopause and each of the exercises is listed in the index.

Eden herself narrates and demonstrates some of the exercises. Initially I was put off by her toothy grin and careful enunciation, however, as it progressed it was obvious that she is a jolly person and her smile is reflected in her eyes.  Each exercise is prefaced with a photo of the model with the acupressure/acupuncture points addressed by the exercise marked. The models are a diverse group of varying ages, races and sizes.  Be advised these are not the botoxed Barbies we have been accustomed to seeing in fitness programs.  These are real women with breasts, bellies and butts. I admit to being amazed (okay, initially horrified) that some of the chubbier models did not corset themselves up in spanx and encase themselves in dark, drab colors.  However, my cultural conditioning evaporated as I realized that these women were truly beautiful. They exude health and happiness and are obviously comfortable with their bodies regardless of size. The promise of that type of acceptance is well worth the price.

The techniques are not difficult and I think this dvd serves best as a companion to the book. I found it annoying to have to flip back and forth between pages to complete a routine.  I have been using some of the exercises for over a month and notice a general improvement in my energy level and outlook.  Additionally, I have lost a few pounds. Note, that this is not a slick presentation by any extent of the imagination.  It is filmed outdoors in what appears to be Eden's backyard. It is attractive but occasionally background noises intrude.  However, everyone involved appears to be enjoying the creation of the program and it is certainly easy and fun to follow.",1237075200,46,2191,4.82620320855615
