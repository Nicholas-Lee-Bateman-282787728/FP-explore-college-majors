6577895,3,B00MHATMQ4,"Peter Roberts (Thomas Jane) is a former US race car driver living in Queensland, the other Sunshine State. He is a part time driving school instructor with a failing marriage. An entertaining Simon Keller (John Cusack) employs Roberts to be his instructor...and park here while I rob this bank. Roberts becomes the unwilling, unlikely get away driver as Keller makes off with nine million in bonds. He explains why in this very linear plot.

The banking institute he robbed are likewise criminals who double crossed him. They send out hitmen. Meanwhile the feds led by an unconvincing, unbuttoned blouse Zoe Ventoura are in pursuit as our robbers make their way across Australia in a couple of different muscle machines.

About half of the film takes place in a car, not as bad as ""Vehicle 19"" but noticeable. Some of the scenery rolling by in the background looks like 1950's special effects. The driving scenes were not impressive and certainly misrepresenting the title. This is a low action, light comedy crime film. Cusack does a good job delivering his one liners and along with a few brief scenes by the daughter excited by the fact her dad is a bank robber, provide the only reasons to watch this film.

Mildly entertaining as long as you are not expecting a heavy action film.

Mr. Keller does what he does, and both characters are chased by the police and others.

The generic story could have been acceptable with better action or comedy set-pieces, which you don't get here. Brian Trenchard-Smiths Drive Hard attempts to be a light-hearted crime comedy, and it fails in every way. The film does not have much action, and what little action there is, is just dull and clichd. And its comedy is not funny.

Everything in Drive Hard looks amateurish. It has no originality, perhaps except the location, which is beautiful to look at. But thats all. Even John Cusack, who looks bored, cant save this mess.",1425859200,,833,4.818181818181818

No one outside of Cusack and Jane can act, the writing and direction are lousy. I chose to watch this movie because I'm a John Cusack fan, but in this movie he looks old, pasty and bored.

Cusack has been in quite a few lower rated flicks of late, but enjoyable non the less. And Jane, we just don't see enough of. It seems even the March of time has hit these guys. Like all of us, they're getting older. If your a fan of these guys, and you have some time to kill, I'd spend some coin and rent it. Amazon had it for rent for 99, can't go wrong at twice the price.

6577923,2,B00MHATMQ4,"""You didn't hire me, you kidnapped me."" Peter Roberts (Jane) is a former race car driver who gave up his dream because his new wife didn't like it. He now spends his days giving driving lessons to teenagers. When Simon Keller (Cusack) shows up for a lesson Roberts isn't excited about the way he drives and takes the keys. When they stop at a bank so Keller can get money to pay he runs out with cops after him and tells Roberts to drive. Now Roberts is wanted has an accomplice but Keller says he will be able to make sure Roberts goes free but he has to help first. Going in I was thinking (probably like you) a movie with Cusack and Jane, woo hoo. Going off that expectation I was disappointed. The main problem with this movie is that is isn't consistent at all. Some parts are very exciting and entertaining while others are so slow moving I found my mind wandering. Surprisingly the best part of this movie is the dialog and interaction between Cusack and Jane. All of the action sequences are repetitive and generic. For a movie that talks about car racing there is really only one chase and it's not a very good one at all. There really isn't a whole lot else to say about this one. Overall, the reason to watch is the interaction between Cusack and Jane. It's actually almost better to just skip to those scenes and skip the rest of the movie. I was very disappointed with this.

8672324,2,B00MHATMQ4,"You can now add John Cusack to the growing list of names of former A-list stars, such as Nicolas Cage and Val Kilmer, who now pretty much take on any movie that offers them a paycheck and name recognition. While Cusack occasionally gets an interesting supporting role in a mainstream film like ""The Butler,"" the sad fact is that the last decently budgeted film he headlined was ""2012,"" which actually showed in theaters three years before its title date. To the growing list of Cusack virtually-direct-to-video money grabs you can add ""Drive Hard,"" a film notable primarily for the facts that it was made in Australia (giving him a nice change of scenery for a couple of weeks) and that it saddles him with a ridiculous wardrobe for the entire film.

Although hes top billed, Cusack isn't really even the lead character in Drive Hard. That honor goes to Thomas Jane, an actor whose career is equally in the toilet with Cusacks but never managed to hit the same heights. Jane plays Peter Roberts, a former champion auto racer whos now reduced to operating a fifth-rate driving school and serving as an aging eye candy husband to a successful corporate lawyer who apparently tolerates him because hes always available for errands. One morning, instead of the usual nervous high schooler, Roberts first customer is Simon Keller (Cusack), an American who indicates he needs some brushing up on his driving skills to maneuver around on the left side of the road in Australia.

What Keller really needs is a getaway driver, as Roberts quickly learns when Keller stops at a bank and pulls off a daring heist. The two quickly make their getaway, but Roberts is identified on camera as one of the robbers and becomes the target of a massive manhunt, While the cops and numerous TV reporters are looking for Roberts, so too are some rather unsavory characters. It seems that the bank is owned by some mobsters who doublecrossed Keller, a professional thief who pulled off a job for them. Keller now has $9 million of their money, and they want it back and Keller gone.

The setup Ive described above takes up the first 20 minutes or so of Drive Hard. The rest of the movie consists of a series of chase scenes mixed in with scenes of Keller and Roberts sitting in their car and arguing. Or, at least, Roberts argues while Keller tosses off deadpan retorts. Cusack has been delivering this sort of witty rejoinder for over two decades, but, almost invariably, in films that give him better lines to toss off. Here, hes his usual affable self but seems to be hung over most of the time and operating on cruise control. That may explain his wardrobe, a black outfit complete with gloves, baseball hat, and sunglasses that conveniently hide much of his face most of the time. Similarly, Jane seems to have only one emotion for the entire film, frustrated, steering-wheel-pounding anger (perhaps he prepared for the role by reflecting on the state of his career).

Drive Hard doesnt seem to have an actual screenplay as much as a rough idea for a story padded out to 90 minutes by having director Brian Trenchard-Smith point his camera at the two leads and telling them to improvise their dialogue. For that reason, the movie seems to consist of the same argument repeated a half dozen or so times. Keller quickly ditches the ridiculous driver training car used in the robbery, and the two stars tool around rural Australia in a much snazzier vehicle for the remainder of the film, but theres no real reason for anything they do other than to put themselves in different locations for each individual chase scene. Nor are the chases any better than the rest of the movie. I cant recall a single bit of stunt work that would suggest the presence of a world-class professional driver behind the wheel. Its merely a couple of minutes of spinning tires and whipping around corners at a decent, but not breathtaking, clip.

My guess would be that most people who watch Die Hard are Cusack fans, and Im giving it a second star on that basis. Theres enough of his presence to make it fitfully tolerable, even though his character seems a tenth generation copy of some of his better roles. But an occasional moment of repartee that brings better movies to mind doesnt justify the investment of 90 minutes of most peoples time, let along the cost of buying the film. Instead of watching Drive Hard, you should instead drive yourself to find a better alternative. Trust me; that won't be hard to do.",1469404800,,4474,4.701530612244898

8672326,3,B00MHATMQ4,"Drive Hard isn't as bad as some reviewers are carrying on about.  It doesn't however contain the level of action that the DVD cover sort of implies, there is a good stunt show type driving police chase (not a believable one, but fun enough to watch) just after the two main characters meet up and Cusak's character goes into a bank, he says to bank traveller's cheques to pay his driving instructor.  Unbeknownst to that driver (played by Thomas Jane), he has really been hired to be the getaway driver, since he was a former race car driver who only isn't doing that anymore because his wife told him to. The driving instructor doesn't want to be a getaway driver but Cusack has a gun.

But after the initial chase the movie does sort of fizzle out.  There's plenty of opportunities for the driving instructor to flee, hide and not get back in the car or even kill Cusack which instead of doing he just gets back in the car.  Also his top driving skills aren't really needed other than as a race car driver you can push the accelerator down with your foot on a rural straight road to outrun bikers.  The movie is set on the Gold Coast here in Australia, but clearly made for an American audience and not one the makers respect to understand the Australian accent, so everyone speaks in an exaggerated one.  In fact the driving instructor's wife sounds South African (in fact very similar to the blonde chick in Lethal Weapon 2). Pretty much everyone owns a gun (not just bad guys and cops), which isn't the way it is here in Australia. The federal police are referred to as the FBI on a few occasions. A petrol station is referred to as a gas station, the getaway cars used are American muscle cars (strangely for a car film they are automatics and not manual transmissions).  The geography of the Gold Coast is completely wrong with them driving through suburbs out of order, places like O'Reillys in the mountains behind the Gold Coast that are a long way away are arrived to in moments, the daughter goes to school at the city's only all boy's private school and things like this, but this is a norm for most movies so no big deal. You do wonder if this was paid for by the real estate companies or tourism board as there's lots of shots of different high rise buildings shot appealingly.

Drive Hard is a movie you may be disappointed with if you were expecting a big car chase movie or even something of higher quality.  But if you go into it with the expectations its a movie you will laugh at scenes you weren't really expecting to going in simply because they are so ridiculous then you'll enjoy it enough.  It did seem like Cusack the only recognisable actor in the film perhaps was doing it reluctantly due to the fact the whole film his face is hidden behind large sunglasses and a black cap, but then again this could have just been a bad costume decision by the makers. I quite liked the daughter of the driving school guy scenes who previously was embarrassed by her father who really embraces the image the media is portraying from him as a fugitive.  They probably should have had more of that type of thing in the movie to make it more of a comedy.",1453852800,,3166,4.430292598967298
