5856748,4,B00DUQIEUO,"I quite enjoyed this movie and the modern soundtrack. I think the music helped set the tone of what was a huge tabloid news story of a century ago, but I can see that it might be too much if you're looking for a period piece. Is it accurate? Probably not, but this is also a Lifetime movie.",1391644800,,290,4.017241379310345
5856749,2,B00DUQIEUO,"""I told you what happened. Do you think I'm hiding something from you?"" During the summer of 1892 in the town of Fall River, Massachusetts a young woman named Lizzie Borden (Ricci)returns to her house and finds her father and step-mother brutally murdered. When the police begin to investigate all the evidence points to Lizzie. Her lawyer comes up with the only defense available. How could a woman kill anyone in that fashion? First of all this is a Lifetime movie so those of you looking for gore and horror can look elsewhere. The movie isn't bad but is glaringly obvious that this is a low budget made for TV movie. The story of this murder is very intriguing and is a good idea for a movie, but the fact that Lifetime did it really tones down what could be a great movie. Christina Ricci is the perfect choice for this role and she is really the only thing that saves the movie. Most of the movie is a courtroom drama which I usually love and the defense that a petite woman couldn't do this is very interesting and shows what the country used to be like. The biggest problem with this movie is that it never achieves the tense feeling it was going for. It is very flat and not as interesting as it could have been. As a side note the music choices were awful, when you watch it you will see what I mean. Overall, flat and emotionless, even for a made-for-TV movie. I give this a C.",1391558400,18,1388,4.32183908045977

Listen Pre-order THE LEGEND OF LIZZIE BORDEN starring ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY it is so FACT based they used actual TRIAL transcripts and Newspapers for dialouge..the house was made to the excat LIZZIE house which is small one bedroom door opens into another and then the hall...the house was a crackerbox so if a killer hid from 9am first murder until 11am second murder LIZZIE would have known buy the ELIZABETH MONTGOMERY version it is classic!!-http://www.amazon.com/Legend-Lizzie-Borden-Elizabeth-Montgomery/dp/B00HZVX14O/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1391641638&sr=1-1&keywords=THE+LEGEND+OF+LIZZIE+BORDEN",1391558400,6,803,6.584905660377358

This movie caused controversy because Ms. Montgomery stripped nude for parts of the movie and those scenes were show closed stage.  This was unheard of, in that time frame, for a made for TV movie.  Nothing was shown in the final cut, but because of the controversy and fear many TV stations refused to show the movie. Please re-release the movie.

5856752,1,B00DUQIEUO,"The Music...it would have been perfect for a film like From Dusk To Dawn but made no sense in this one. The Clothing...in 1892, women's fashion pretty much covered them from head to toe. Having Ricci in a button up shirt with the top 3-4 buttons open didn't make sense for the time period and, what was that supposed to be around her neck... a man's neck tie?!  The Morphine...if the doctor was giving her a drug to calm her, why was she always so alert and quick to answer questions?  And was I the only one that noticed the way people spoke did not represent speach in 1892?

There was no time given to develop any of the characters so you really didn't understand why Lizzie was accused of brutally murdering her father and stepmother. In Lifetime's attempt to make this film ""hip and now"", they destroyed it. If they wanted to make a bland film about a daughter murdering her parents, why call it Lizzie Borden? I think we all know the answer to that one. I'd like to tell you to watch Elizabeth Montgomery's far superior version of Lizzie Borden but, oh that's right, good movies don't make it to DVD in the USA!",1391385600,10,1117,4.386473429951691

5856754,3,B00DUQIEUO,"I did enjoy this new version of Lizzie Borden, although it will never top the original version! I am hoping that because of this remake, a studio will get the rights to the 1975 'The Legend of Lizzie Borden' starring Elizabeth Montgomery and release it on DVD/Blu-Ray. The '75 version deserves a proper release. But of course such a classic movie will probably never see a DVD/Blu-Ray release because Hollywood is too warped and they rather remake the movies instead...",1391126400,,469,4.875
5856755,1,B00DUQIEUO,"I had high hopes this made for tv movie would be even better than the '75 version with Elizabeth Montgomery.  I sat through maybe thirty minutes of this and erased it from the dvr.  The old version with Elizabeth Montgomery is still superior to any other version I've seen!  What I can't understand is WHY it has never been released on dvd?  Its a shame that there are still so many good shows that the studios refuse to release for whatever reason and this is one!

Even at the end of this movie, when it states that her sister moved out and they never spoke again -- it is not true. They lived together until old age and are buried next to each other.  We toured the house, museum and cemetery and they were well known in the town for decades after the murders.

5856787,3,B00DUQIEUO,"This is my generic comments on the stories that says Lizzie Dunnit.
This story is dedicated to the ace typewriter mechanic Martin Tytell, who built a duplicate typewriter when the experts said it couldn't be done.

Perry Bricker was reading his legal journal when his secretary Della Lane opened the door to his office. ""Chief, there's a young woman here to see you about a problem."" ""Show her in, Della."" ""Hello Mr. Bricker, my name is Lizzie Berdan and my parents were really sick last night. I think our milk was poisoned by an enemy of my father."" Perry knew about Andrew Jackson Berdan, a self-made man famous for his avariciousness. ""You must not be buying Borden Dairy Milk"" said Perry. ""No"" said Miss Lizzie. ""Father used his position at the bank to award a supply contract to Farmer Gray and now he gets his milk at a special rate."" Perry said he would use his detective Paul Gander to investigate.

The next day a telephone call brought news about the murder of Andrew and his second wife Abby. The only two people known to be in the house, Lizzie and the maid Bridget, were the chief suspects. Bridget was soon cleared, she was outside at the time of Abby's murder. Paul Gander reported that his operative talked to Bridget, who told of an unexpected visit from Uncle John the day before. Lizzie and Uncle John spoke in a low voice when Bridget was near, this was unusual. The house was searched from top to bottom but no bloody axe was found, nor any blood-stained clothes. When Lizzie was arrested Perry visited her in jail. ""Is there anything new to tell me?"" asked Perry. ""Mr. Bricker, I didn't tell you about my cousin William. He had a debt that was coming due and was supposed to see father. William has a terrible temper and was once sent to a hospital. I want William's name kept out of this for family reasons. I am innocent of committing this crime."" ""Well Miss Lizzie, you would be surprised by the number of innocent men in prison"" said Perry.

When the trial of Miss Lizzie began Perry, with the information developed by Paul Gander, was able to cast reasonable doubt on the testimony of the state's witnesses. The gilt paint in Abby's skull proved a fairly new axe was used. One of Gander's operatives obtained information about Raymond and his half-brother William. The former was seen to be waiting in front of the Berdan home, as if resting his wagon in the shade on that hot August morning. Raymond was called to the stand but said little. William was called to the stand and didn't say much. Then Perry asked him about the loan and if he was late in payment. His face flushed and he shouted ""Yes, I did it and I'm glad! I'd do it again if I had the chance!"" ""Once is enough"" said Perry.

Judge Arnold Brown directed a verdict of not guilty, and so a guiltless Lizzie Berdan returned home. But tongues wagged, and public opinion turned against Lizzie. She was guilty except a slick lawyer fooled a half-wit into confessing. Or maybe they were both in cahoots. And so the legend of Lizzie grew. There was a jingle that was repeated like a popular song. To this day most people think she was guilty.",1443052800,,3127,4.519434628975265

The music selection was absolutely obnoxious, almost to the point where it was comical.  I don't know what ""effect"" the producer was trying to achieve, but it ""didn't land.""  The two actresses that played Lizzie and Emma were far too young for the roles.  Lizzie was close to 32 when all this took place, and Emma was almost old enough to be a ""mother figure"" to her.  Although both actresses did an excellent job in portraying the two sisters, they just weren't realistically convincing.  There definitely should have been a bigger age difference between both actresses.  Other than that, the movie was pretty good.",1438646400,,725,4.698412698412699

5856795,5,B00DUQIEUO,"This is a brilliant movie. Of course Ricci's performance is the core of the film. I think the entire cast is excellent. The title itself makes an accusation. There are many bloody visuals that likewise imply guilt. It is best for the viewer to make up their own mind.

I enjoyed the history. Things were twisted in order to convey this particular story. Yet many of the gruesome elements were very real. That is the most disturbing part. A trial where a broken skull was actually submitted as evidence.

There just isn't much like this tale, except of course the TV series that recently completed, which took the story to the next level. However, it is the movie that gave me one of my favorite phrases of all time.

5856797,5,B00DUQIEUO,"My thoughts: First off, forget even trying to compare this film with the classic Elizabeth Montgomery movie The Legend Of Lizzie Borden because there is nothing there that can compare other than, maybe the stylized interpretations of the facts themselves. Montgomery gives a fab performance that does a good job of separating her portrayal here from her very famous persona on Bewitched. With equal respect Christina Ricci does a great job of creating a very emotionally charged, yet sociopathic-driven portrayal of Borden that brings more life to Lizzie Borden than I anticipated or even expected. It has been common belief that it was more than just selfish desire that drove Lizzie Borden to kill. She carried with her a dark passenger that created a sinister, cold, disconnected aspect to Lizzie Borden that was probably an unmentioned issue from early in her childhood. Ricci gives us that in calm, calculated edified gesture.

The stories atmosphere is a gothic blend of surrealism and psychological narrative wrapped around early Americana and polished off with modern folksy, indie rock sounds that are as dark as the story and characters within it. It gives Lizzie Borden Took An Ax a modern, fresh energy that excites the viewer. Now there are still down moments within the film that create momentary lulls, but nothing that causes the movie to completely stall. Bonus aspect that really makes this movie watchable is the visionary, creative way the director chose to tell the story balancing between stoic character interactions, and shocking, visceral moments of brutality that are honest to the murder scenes truth. This movie definitely delivered on giving me a great Lizzie Borden film. A definite watch!",1432166400,,1719,5.183453237410072

5856803,1,B00DUQIEUO,"I was very disappointed after watching this. I'm from Fall River and have lived here my whole life, so I am more than familiar with the case. I am still baffled that they're boasting this as the true story of Lizzie Borden because they have no authority to say that. She was acquitted and, to this day, the case in unsolved. I really like Christina Ricci, so I was excited to see, but, while I think her performance at portraying a very troubled, mentally unstable young woman is good, her physique is too pretty and feminine to portray the more masculine Lizzie Borden, but that was easily overlooked. The whole thing is just far too historically inaccurate for me, but that's me. I was looking for a movie/show on what happened; a story starting on the day Andrew and Abby were murdered, but no clue into who actually did it because we still don't know, up until Lizzie was acquitted and then a portral of her life until death when she donated her life fortune to the Fall River Animal Rescue League. What I got, however, was a murderous lunatic that was killing much more than just parents and a backstory of partying that was far from belivable because Lizzie was not a soctal butterfly by any means. I also didn't appreciate the scenery. Being a Fall Riverite, I have seen plenty of photos of 1890 Fall River and have actually been to the 2nd Street house twice. The film does a terrible job at portraying the scenery. It looks dingy and borderlive King Arthur-ey. The children singing the nursery rhyme have it all wrong too.

I don't want to discourage anyone from watching. I am probably more critical than most because I am from the town where the murder took place, so my childhood dealt with the history a lot. If that weren't the case, I probably would have enjoyed it. I did like the music, however, but it was just a really weird and questionable choice for this particular film in this time period.

Service was very Good.  I recommend them.",1417737600,,58,4.8
5856813,4,B00DUQIEUO,"Christina Ricci does a particularly nice job here of playing Lizzie. She does it differently from the way Elizabeth Montgomery did back in the 1970s. Montgomery did a great job in her own right, just different. Here Ricci plays Lizzie as if she is the very bad girl in the neighborhood but that badness is just right under the surface. It bubbles up here and there but most of the time she keeps it laced up, just like her clothes.

In both versions it is not any big mystery why Andrew and Abby Borden, the victims, were disliked by just about everyone. They were rich misers who wanted everyone around them to be as miserable as they were. They had no empathy for anyone and could be downright cruel and cutting. Abby Borden was busy getting as much of her husband's estate into her own clutches as she could all of the time. This is borne out also by all writings published concerning this case. Here is a man in 1892 with half a million dollars to his name and he won't even let his family have an indoor toilet. So although the prosecutor valiantly strives to bring their murderer to justice, I think it is fair to say that after a good dose of meeting Abby and Andrew, thereafter you are solely interested in Lizzie as a character, not in avenging their miserable, hateful lives.

This version gets many of the historical details wrong and I wish the makers had been more scrupulous about this. Lizzie had three lawyers, not one, and one of them was the ex governor of the state. These three lawyers pounded the holes in the prosecution's theory and the prosecution had no rebuttal. Lizzie only had 8-13 minutes to clean the axe, herself, and get rid of any and all evidence. This was a major facet of reasonable doubt used by her lawyers but here it is never mentioned. That 8-13 minute window was impossible to work one's way around and made reasonable doubt a virtual certainty. It was a huge point in the trial and should have been a huge point in this production but was not. Even if she took off her dress, there is still not enough time. The house is so well documented online yet they found the one house in New England that looks nothing like it!  Ditto the courthouse! Anyone can find pictures of these online in less than a minute. Lizzie also looked nothing like either Ricci or Montgomery but that is ok. I realize the main character had to be picked for acting ability. Both Ricci and Montgomery are much more attractive women than Borden was. The only problem is that Ricci portrays Lizzie as someone who was also available to men and they wanted her. This was not true of the real Lizzie Borden. It was rumored she was a lesbian but no one knows. She died a spinster in her late 60s.

I was interested recently to read that Andrew Borden had a grown illegitimate son. He treated him badly as well. That son was someone who could have hated enough to kill as well. Andrew had not provided for him in his will, however, so he would not have gotten rich off of killing him. Both Emma and Lizzie became very rich over both deaths.

I think Lizzie is the most logical person to have murdered them but there is not a question in my mind there is reasonable doubt and that no one will ever know. Just like the Montgomery one, this version ""solves"" the case for the viewer. This is not really possible. It is to this day considered one of the great cold cases.

No one knows why Lizzie and Emma parted. Neither of them ever told anyone.

The Lizzie Borden house is now a bed & breakfast Inn in Fall River, MA and is quite popular. It has a website called lizzie-borden.

The character development was well done, Ricci portrayed the true enigma that Lizzy seemed to be. During the trials lizzy was viewed as both an intro/extrovert (yes..they do exist) and she did have difficulties and anxieties that eventually led to her being acquited. Either way it's obvious Lifetime was trying to do something different and this movie was done with a playful, sinister tone. I want to know the music artists who performed on the movie track.

5856822,2,B00DUQIEUO,"A silly and inaccurate attempt to ""explain"" the ""mystery"" of the 1892 Lizzie Borden Case in which Ms Borden was acquitted of murdering her parents  with an axe - for no apparent reason if you watch this mess of a film.
""Took An Axe"" desperately tries to create a mystery out what in today's era of forensics, fingerprints and DNA would have have been a slam-dunk, open-and-shut case (3 people in a locked house; 2 get hacked to death with a hatchet...duuuuuh) and attempts to create the Big Reveal that supposedly solves this age-old mystery by claiming...(bum...bum...bum) Lizzie was NAKED when she committed the crime!!!!
Yeah...its that stupid - and worse - it takes the entire movie for us to get there.
Christina Ricci is hopelessly miscast as Lizzie ( who was a strapping woman in her mid-30's - not anywhere close to looking like the girlish Ricci) and so she mostly just mopes and flounces around in her Victorian underwear either glaring at everyone or staring ""moodily"" at things off-camera.
Its a shame too - as there is much of interest in the Borden case - the position of women at that time; the idea that ""nice""  wealthy girls simply did not commit crimes; the struggles of single ""spinster"" women under patrician fathers  ...all of which would have made for an interesting examination of this story...but this is NOT that story.",1410825600,2,1344,4.7844827586206895

5856824,2,B00DUQIEUO,"Watched this on Netflix.  First of all, it began by showing the relationship with Lizzie's father as somewhat creepy - almost as though there were sexual nuances to their relationship.  The way she hugged him and he withdrew as though repulsed in some way.  Second, the musical score was modern rock music which totally destroyed any feeling of reality the movie might have achieved.  Third, there were many inaccuracies in the production, particularly with regard to the sister and the destroying of the dress.  And what of that kissing scene with the boy next door outside the barn????

Since I watched it for free, I don't feel it was a total waste of time.  Had I purchased it, I'd have wanted my money back.  This was a blown opportunity.  If you want to watch a good movie regarding Lizzie Borden, watch the 1975 version with Elizabeth Montgomery.

If you wish to question casting of her in anything, take a look at ""Monster"" with her opposite Charlize Theron.

Not only does the movie artfully interweave all of the known facts and clues surrounding the Borden murders, but it presents them in a way that leaves you with a shadow of doubt in the end.

The family was a prison unto its members.  Hints of deeper family dysfunction, incest, cruelty, abuse, affairs with strangers, outsiders who hated the father, a gold-digging step-family, lesbian relations, and possible conspiracies involving Lizzie are artfully presented through character interaction, dialogue, and quick flashbacks.  Not to mention the fact that another axe murderer was running around at the time!  All these interesting things are taken into account through a narrative structure that keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Don't blink.  Pay attention.

Arguments claiming that Lizzie did it make sense.  Arguments that point out the very real possibility it was someone else make sense!  Arguments that surmise both previous arguments are true make sense as well!

An anachronistic soundtrack really adds the appropriate flavor and tone to scenes of this movie.  Kind of the way it does in The Great Gatsby (with Leonardo DiCapprio).  Really cool.

The performances wrap you up in this creepy, enchanting tale of murder.  This is a great suspenseful mystery.

Here someone has the ability to make a Lizzie Borden movie, and they don't take the small amount of time to check their facts.  I think Christina Ricci was good as Lizzie.  Tho she had brown eyes in the movie, Lizzie was known for her steel blue-gray eyes.  But Ms. Ricci did a good job acting and using her eyes.  (I wonder if they could have put blue contact lenses on her.  That would have been much better.)  The Borden house was made to look pretty cutesy.  It was a boring house, plain, almost foreboding, painted a ""drab"" color.  I understand that the owner of the murder house/ B & B today was never contacted about the movie.  Lizzie's father was good, but they could have taken the time to make him have white hair and beard.  The casting of Abby was lousy.  By just getting hold of a couple people who know the case well, it could have been the best movie ever made about Lizzie.  People in the story were missing.  Lizzie was saying some of her lines at the wrong time and not to the correct person(s).  Lizzie's story did not end after the trial.  I wish they would have continued into her life at Maplecroft.

I caught this movie on TV when it premiered. I am familiar with the legend/case of Lizzie Borden and was curious to see Christina Ricci in the role. She does a pretty good job as Lizzie Borden and Clea DuVall is great as Lizzie's sister. The costumes and settings are pretty well done and capture the time period well- it is believable.... UP UNTIL the funeral cemetery scene where you first hear this terrible modern day, blues/rock music come out of nowhere. It COMPLETELY takes you right out of the movie. Here is this serious scene rendered completely noneffective due to the producers horrible notion to add modern music to a period piece. Totally takes a crap on anything the director/movie makers were trying to achieve. I almost shut it off. The worst part is, is that it kept happening throughout the film. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT AT ALL. The only way I would purchase this DVD is if it was selling for a dollar and even then, I would still have to MUTE THE SOUND during those fore mentioned parts.

I would, however, recommend this movie to those teaching a film class to demonstrate WHAT NOT TO DO when producing a movie. Or a class on how to lose the audience and turn a movie into garbage as quick as you can.",1403740800,3,1263,4.463203463203463

5856846,4,B00DUQIEUO,"LIZZIE BORDEN TOOK AN AX

While watching Flowers in the Attic on Lifetime I saw a commercial for another Lifetime original to come the following week, Lizzie Borden Took an Ax. Not only was it about the famous ax murders from back in the day but it stared the excellent Christina Ricci. I had to see it with all those things added in plus the trailer looked excellent. So the next week we loaded up and went to my grandparents house again since they wanted to see it as well.

Massachusetts 1892 and Lizzie Borden is just living her life normally day by day. That is until she walks in to find her father murdered on the coach. The town is shocked as something like this is not the normal murder. The police are under pressure to solve the case as it turns out Mr. Bordens wife was also found murdered upstairs. The only odd thing about this is no one saw any one coming or going that was not supposed to be there. So the suspect list is virtually no existent except for one, the woman who found the first body, Lizzie.

I was so excited for this flick and just like I thought I enjoyed it. Ricci is excellent here as the alleged ax murderer and plays the part perfectly, particularly in the trial scenes. The film shows everything from before the murders, murders, trial and of course aftermath. It is the aftermath that I found particularly interesting. In fact the ending is not all that hard to believe, youll see. Everyone else in the flick is good and I love the time period of the film, I know it really was that time since this is a true story but  I love the look. The only downfall is the rushed feel and the lack of development for characters and events. Director Nick Gomez [New Jersey Drive among others] may be at fault but I feel like it was the script from Stephen Kay [director of Boogeyman].

Still this was a good flick for a TV production from Lifetime. I loved the look of the film and Ricci was absolutely perfect for the role. Ricci is one of my all time favorite actresses plus I think she is beautiful. So the film had all that going for it. I wish that there would have been a commentary track for the DVD or something but it is pretty bare.",1400025600,2,2167,4.275609756097561
5856847,5,B00DUQIEUO,"I really should have recorded this film that was telecasted yesterday because I found it to be a hidden treasure and I can't wait to see it again. While Christina Ricci's acting is sometimes criticized, I felt she was perfect in the part of the innocent-looking 22-year- old Lizzie, who by all accounts got away with the double murder of her father and stepmother.  Clea Duvall, who we don't see enough of, was also very strong as the older Borden sister, who refuses to believe her sister committed the crime and refused to give negative courtroom testimony about Lizzie despite her own sneaky suspicions. . Gregg Henry, who was recently featured in TV's ""The Following"" portraying a psychopathic serial killing physician, who mentors the story's anti-hero, Joe Carroll and sets him  on his murderous path, does a complete ""role reversal"" here, portraying a holier than thou prosecutor, who despite his best efforts is unable to convict Lizzie of her horrific crime.
There are a few problems, with insertion of modern pop, rock and hip-hop background  music that would have no place in the 1880s, but this probably was inserted to show Lizzie's disturbed mental state during and just after committing the crime. Overall, however, this movie held my attention throughout.  To me this is a 4.5 or a 5 star work that is really outstanding for a TV movie, although a see a lot of other reviewers strongly disagree with my assessment.",1399852800,8,1430,4.896694214876033

The houses were the first joke, Lizzie would have loved living in the house used. It was far more impressive than the one she lived in where the murders were committed. The music, give me a break, rock music was not even thought of in 1892. The producers also left out the main reason why Mrs. Borden was even in the front bedroom, it failed to mention that Lizzie and Emma's uncle had spent the night there.....how many people do you know that would strip and remake a perfectly clean bed? The whole trial was a joke, in this version Bridget spoke with clarity and knowledge when in fact she became confused and very nervous at the actual trial, oft times not understanding questions that she was asked. One true fact was the scene in the church that Lizzie and Emma attended after the trial, the people did, reportedly, get up and moved away from them when they sat down. There was also a lot of gossip about the fact that the sisters DID NOT wear black to the funerals and did not enter a period of mourning. All in all, this movie is a sham and very historically incorrect. I am a Christina Ricci fan, but, she laid an egg in this one. Someone should take an ax to whoever mis-wrote this.

5856855,3,B00DUQIEUO,"This Lifetime retelling of the story portrays Andrew Borden (Stephen McHattie) as a stern man who was disliked by everyone. Lizzie (Christina Ricci) is depicted as someone who lies, steals, is rebellious and flirty with her father. She is not played by Lindsey Lohan which would have been great considering how she butchered Elizabeth Taylor.

The film doesn't develop character much beyond that. It utilizes a modern soundtrack to help us feel that mental imbalance of Lizzie. This is about as close to a grindhouse Lifetime will ever get. It doesn't show the actual killings, but like the court of public opinions, leads us to believe she was guilty and used the superior Elizabeth Montgomery, killed them while naked, explanation. Her wild eyes cast nicely into the role of a mentally unstable person.

How is it that 34 year old Christina Ricci still looks like she is 14? Is she a vampire sucking off the blood of virgins or what? I mean you can still see her ribs. Doesn't she eat?

And gave her mother forty whacks.
When she saw what she had done,
She gave her father forty-one.""

The Lizzie Borden murder case is legendary.  I recall first hearing about it when I was a child in the late 1940s.  A few years later, it was the subject of a satiric number in the hit Broadway musical, NEW FACES OF 1952.

Surprisingly, with the exception of an acclaimed 1975 television movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery, Hollywood and other filmmakers have only taken a passing interest in Lizzie Borden and the 1892 brutal murder of her parents in Fall River, Massachusetts.  Lizzie was tried and acquitted for that crime and, officially, the killings remain unsolved to this day.

In LIZZIE BORDEN TOOK AN AXE, writer Stephen Kay and director Nick Gomez leave no doubt as to their belief that Ms. Borden carried out the dastardly deed.  In advance of the killings, they even show Lizzie laying the groundwork for an alternate theory of the crime and, as with the Elizabeth Montgomery version, she avoids getting blood on her clothing by committing the murders in the nude.

Christina Ricci delivers a compelling performance as Lizzie, playing the 32-year old woman almost like a rebellious teen who is guilty of shoplifting and other small thefts, as well as having incestuous feelings toward her staid father (Stephen McHattie).  Also in the capable cast are Clea DuVall, Gregg Henry, Billy Campbell and Sara Botsford.

LIZZIE BORDEN TOOK AN AXE is a television movie, shot in Canada and released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

5856860,1,B00DUQIEUO,"The problem here for the filmmakers is the subject matter: it's too well-known. The Borden case was and remains a landmark in not just in folklore and American pop culture, but in crimonology -- the study of true crime. There are dozens and dozens of books that have studied every angle of the case. It has fascinated generations of historians, amateur sleuths, and professional detectives. August 4, 1892 is THE seminal date in the history of American crime.

And for that reason, the anachronisms and lack of attention to detail makes the movie, while well-meaning, come across as sloppy and lazy. The cramped and meager nature of the Borden household is not only a well-known aspect of the case, it is central to the enigma -- how could a double-murderer go unnoticed in such a cozy space? Both historically and dramatically, it makes no sense for the Bordens to live in a lavish, rambling mini-mansion. Why would the daughters be feel financially slighted living in such a home?

It goes downhill from there. The worst aspect of the otherwise-excellent Liz Montgomery adaptation in the 70s was its trite and sleazy explanation for the murders: a naked Lizzie stalking her victims with a dripping hatchet which is something out of a cheap slasher film and almost certainly not what occurred that tragic day. The image of a butt naked Victorian lady running around her home chopping her family up with the maid coming and going and an uncle set to return at any time is laughable. The house was covered with friends and police officers within minutes -- the first physician to attend to the deceased Mr. Borden found his blood still flowing from his wounds. If Lizzie had killed them herself nude how would she have had time -- in minutes -- to wash off, dress in those heavy Victorian era clothes in such a way that the first neighbor on the scene reported that there was not a bead of sweat or water on her and not a hair out of place, and hide of bloody water, bloody bucket, and bloody hatchet so assiduously that two top-to-bottom searches of the house that took place that day and the day after would turn up nothing?

I had hoped the film would explore other more likely possibilities -- a vengeful employee or business partner, a scorned suitor of Lizzie, or what I believe is the most likely scenarios: a murder-for-hire engineered by the sisters and their suspicious Uncle (the brother of Andrew's first wife) who mysteriously happened to be visiting from way out West at the time of the killings. Uncle John is likewise crucial to any exploration of the case -- he appears nowhere in this movie. Instead the movie doubles down on the naked Lizzie silliness in addition to costumes, sets, and general character attitudes being all wrong. Ricci performs excellently as the role is written, but she is all wrong for the role historically. She comes across like a sullen, waifish goth teenager where the real Lizzie was mature, robust, and even stately (Montgomery was perfectly cast, by way of comparison).

The entire movie comes across a cheap low budget flick, which in a way is a good thing: there is still room for a serious movie or miniseries on the subject that can capture not only the complexities of the case and the characters involved, but of the its culture and context, and complex and colorful setting that was late 19th Fall River, Massachusetts.",1396224000,12,3373,4.741056218057921

I bought it to have a document of Brenda Lewis whom I consider the greatest singing actress of our time (and yes, I did see Callas).  She is superb.",1395705600,3,296,4.653846153846154
5856862,3,B00DUQIEUO,"This Lifetime retelling of the story portrays Andrew Borden (Stephen McHattie) as a stern man who was disliked by everyone. Lizzie (Christina Ricci) is depicted as someone who lies, steals, is rebellious and flirty with her father. She is not played by Lindsey Lohan which would have been great considering how she butchered Elizabeth Taylor.

The film doesn't develop character much beyond that. It utilizes a modern soundtrack to help us feel that mental imbalance of Lizzie. This is about as close to a grindhouse Lifetime will ever get. It doesn't show the actual killings, but like the court of public opinions, leads us to believe she was guilty and used the superior Elizabeth Montgomery, killed them while naked, explanation. Her wild eyes cast nicely into the role of a mentally unstable person.

How is it that 34 year old Christina Ricci still looks like she is 14? Is she a vampire sucking off the blood of virgins or what? I mean you can still see her ribs. Doesn't she eat?

5856864,2,B00DUQIEUO,"The only thing that kept me from making this a one star review was the casting because it wasn't all bad.  Christina Ricci is a competent actress but she couldn't have been more wrong for the part of Lizzie.  Lizzie was a large, substantial woman and I doubt very seriously that she gave off the mad, buggy-eyed stare that we got continually from Ricci, but that's a minor quibble.  Far worse was the appalling lack of attention to detail given by the script writers.  A simple google search would have clued them on the facts of the case but, of course, they had to re-write the story to suit their preconceived notions and 21st century mindset.  The list of errors is too long to go into here but one of the most egregious mistakes was the affair of the burning of the dress.  Lizzie burned it in the kitchen stove telling everyone who would listen that it had paint stains and needed to be got rid of.  All the drama with Emma covering up for her and the big dramatic scent of the burning of the dress in a cauldron in the yard for ""no particular reason"" with Alice watching in horror from an upstairs window was pure fiction. The real Borden house was nothing like the house used for filming.  I doubt very seriously that the real Lizzie would have been at all unhappy with that grand house.  Stealing money and mirrors?  Please.  The plunging neckline wardrobe and lack of or poor hat choices was completely silly and anachronistic.  I could go on.  And don't get me started on the soundtrack - what nitwit came up with that idea!  My husband has often jokingly said that Hollywood conceives and writes many of their scripts while getting high at coke parties.  After seeing ""Lizzie Borden Took an Axe"", I don't doubt it.

For a more authentic re-telling of Lizzie's story, watch ""The Legend of Lizzie Borden"" with Elizabeth Montgomery.  Even better, read a book on the subject.  It will be time better spent than watching this silly version.",1391904000,48,1947,4.545977011494253
5856865,4,B00DUQIEUO,"""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" is fascinating and keeps you glued to your seat! Christina Ricci in the title role as Lizzie Borden gives a disturbing and complex performance as the accused hatchet killer. Her cool demeanor and flashes of innocent smiles leaves chills. The infamous crime of the century has been retold in numerous television and film versions including one with Elizabeth Montgomery, (of ""Bewitched"" fame) who was an actual distant relative of Lizzie Borden herself. I enjoyed the 1975 made for television movie and thought Elizabeth Montgomery was excellent. But this version with Christina Ricci is morbidly entertaining with a wonderful cast that includes talented Clea DuvVall as Lizzie's older sister, Emma Borden. DuvVall is convincing and the scenes between the Borden sisters are powerful. The scene of Lizzie burning her dress and her sister's confrontation, is memorable and raises more questions. Director Nick Gomez born in Massachusetts, probably grew up hearing about the grisly murders and does a good job captivating the audience in ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" both in and out of the courtroom. There are underlying hints of an inappropriate relationship between Andrew Borden and his youngest daughter Lizzie in certain scenes. Accused of striking her father 11 times with an ax and delivering the 19 fatal blows to her stepmother, Lizzie Borden made national and international news in 1892. After more than 120 years, it remains one of the most talked about unsolved crimes in history. The ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" film includes quick edits of the ax forcibly coming down in flashbacks and allows one's imagination to run wild. The bluegrass rock and roll soundtrack surprisingly works in key scenes as when the horse and carriage frenetically rushes Lizzie Borden to the inquest. As much as has been written about Lizzie Borden, this movie manages to reel in the viewer as curious sleuth to peel more layers and investigate the events and motive leading up to the murders. ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" is campy and compelling at the same time. The film recreates the Borden home and the town of Fall Rivers, Massachusetts, and costumes with believable accuracy. The film's direction, cinematography, editing, and all around good performances add intrigue and make this an overall interesting film. The exchange between the two Borden sisters and Emma's facial expressions in the last scene without any dialogue is powerful and not to be missed!",1391731200,6,2475,5.159203980099503

8598003,1,B00DUQIEUO,"This would have worked for me had it added more comedy, and not just because for anyone who's spent 5 minutes on Wikipedia reading up on Lizzie Borden this film is rendered sheer nonsense.  At least the 1975 Elizabeth Montgomery film grappled with real ideas and did what it could to cleave to some of the known facts and stood as a good film in its own right.  This version of a famous story is slight & trite, and I think would have benefited from playing for laughs, because I swear it kept teetering on the comic-absurd.  I got the point a contemporary sensibility is signaled by the soundtrack, i.e. suspend your judgement on the history because this is just Lizzie-lite, but the soundtrack just played up the comic angle that I think the film would have benefited from.  The cast are fine, its just the material is dodgy.  On the positive side, I appreciated the colour palette of the film, browns and greys and olive greens and Clea Duvall who played Emma Borden was excellent. It felt like she was in a different film.

8598006,5,B00DUQIEUO,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2014 and directed by Nick Gomez, ""Lizzie Borden Took an Ax"" chronicles the infamous hatchet murders of Andrew & Abby Borden (Stephen McHattie & Sara Botsford) that took place in Fall River, Massachusetts, on August 4, 1892, presumably by Andrews suffocating daughter, Lizzie (Christina Ricci). Clea DuVall plays Lizzies sister, Emma, while Hannah Emily Anderson is on hand as the maid. Gregg Henry appears as the determined prosecutor.

I just watched this version and 1975s The Legend of Lizzie Borden with Elizabeth Montgomery back-to-back and I give this one the edge. Its a little more compelling and has an excellent edgy soundtrack, albeit anachronistic. People complain about the music, but its not like its anything new to apply rockin soundtracks to historical movies; Marie Antoinette did it in 2006 and Spag Westerns did it decades prior in the early 70s. Besides, the soundtracks not all rockin; its diverse, creative and thoroughly entertaining. In any case, I recommend seeing both versions to compare the data and understand what was going on behind the scenes at the Borden abode.

While its impossible to defend Lizzies gruesome actions, both movies help you see why she felt she had to do what she did (with 99.9% certainty). Her father was rich, a struggling mortician turned businessman and property developer, but he refused to update their house (they still had a pit latrine instead of flush toilets) or move to a more affluent neighborhood. Lizzie just turned 32 while Emma was 9 years older and marriage was less and less likely of a potential escape. The stepmother, Abby, was short & fat and pressuring Andrew to change his will for her benefit. The Borden house itself was curiously structured in that there were no hallways and thus one room linked to another, which hindered privacy. In short, the household was a ticking Victorian time bomb with mounting hostilities waiting to explode.

8598007,4,B00DUQIEUO,"This modern update of the Elizabeth Montgomery classic stars the incomparable Christina Ricci as the all but guilty lady of children's song lyrics.

Ricci shines in this. She brings a thoughtful performance to a woman stifled under her father's rule in the Victorian Midwest. It seems she has deep issues that are suggested, mainly because of history or our lack of knowledge.

Why did she do it? Did she even do it? What about the sister? Lots of questions and ambiguities. The film thrives on it. It answers some but does it in an either/or way. Ricci is a great actress that has gone unappreciated.

This TV film was so successful in 2014 that gave it an 8 episode season after it aired. There are no special features on this DVD, other than almost 11 minutes of previews.",1513036800,,775,4.601449275362318

8598009,4,B00DUQIEUO,"Christina Ricci stars in this made-for-TV dramatization of the 1893 trial of Lizzie Andrew Borden for the murder of her father and step-mother in Fall River, Massachusetts. The highly-stylized production recounts events immediately surrounding the murders and subsequent trial. Lizzie Borden Took an Ax (2014) was later developed into a TV Mini-Series The Lizzie Borden Chronicles (2015). It blends a modern soundtrack with historic events to create an oddly entertaining take on the controversial case.

At 11:10 a.m. on August 4, 1892, Lizzy Borden (Christina Ricci), 32, yelled for the family maid, Bridget Sullivan (Hannah Anderson), to quickly come downstairs. She discovered her father, Andrew (Stephen McHattie), slumped over the sofa. His head had been bashed in. Abby (Sara Botsford), Lizzys stepmother, was found on the floor of an upstairs bedroom, her head and face smashed. Lizzy gave police strange and often conflicting information, and she quickly became the chief suspect.

Her New Bedford trial, beginning in June 1893, was a national sensation, widely reported in the newspapers. It took the jury 90 minutes to acquit her, and with her inheritance, she purchased a new home and lived there with her sister Emma (Clea DuVall). Despite efforts to start a new life, Lizzy Borden was ostracized from Fall River society, since many people believed she was the murderer.

There are several alternative theories about who done it, but Lizzie Borden Took an Ax doesnt entertain any of them. It openly implies Lizzie was the murderer, even going so far as to imagine Lizzie confessing the crime to her sister, causing her to flee their home in disgust. In fact, the two sisters split in an argument over a party in 1905, 12 years after the trial. Well never know what the sisters said to each other in private conversation, so this is creative license at work.

The film weirdly sexualizes Lizzie Borden, and for that, Christina Ricci was perfect for the role, but Ricci looks nothing like a proper, White Anglo-Saxon Protestant spinster. The real Lizzie Borden was a member of the Womens Christian Temperance Union, which advocated abstinence from alcohol. Rumors about Lizzies sexuality revolved around an alleged relationship with the actress Nance ONeil, but this gossip was probably of the kind leveled at any unmarried, middle-aged person at the time. Lizzie is portrayed as attempting to seduce everyone who gets in her way, even her own father, and is shown committing the murders in the nude.

Lizzie Borden Took an Ax is well-paced. This 87-minute movie doesnt waste time dwelling on irrelevant information or side stories. It effectively shows the tension in the Borden household prior to the murders and moves on. The audience doesnt need to see flashbacks of Lizzies childhood, labored exposition, or other staples of historic biopics. The filmmakers establish their backgrounds with a few lines and a few short scenes.

Veteran character actor Gregg Henry was given the unenviable role of playing prosecutor Hosea Knowlton, who is portrayed in this film as the antagonist. Lizzie Borden gives him every reason to suspect shes the killer, yet Knowltons insistence on prosecuting her comes off as a witch-hunt, as few believe her capable of a brutal double murder. He is a forceful presence on screen, but his edge is dulled by the knowledge hell ultimately lose the case. Filmmakers tried to cast the verdict as a surprise, but its hard to do that when your source material is a real trial.

There are many ways to make a compelling film about the Borden murdersthe drama practically writes itself. Lizzie Borden Took an Ax chose not to focus on alternative theories, public interest in the case (it was the first trial followed nationally in the American press), or social issues, but to glamorize Lizzie herself. Christina Ricci fans love this movie, and its a capable and entertaining introduction to the case, just don't reference it in a history paper.",1507161600,,3980,5.095092024539877
