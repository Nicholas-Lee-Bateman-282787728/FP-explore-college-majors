6608325,4,B00N35J8VQ,"Video is not easy, but is simple to follow.  Seems very effective in a short period of time.  Didn't give it 5 stars only because it's a little boring but it does give you a really good workout.",1416441600,12,194,4.078947368421052
6608326,5,B00N35J8VQ,"I love Ashley!!!  I tried the head to toe workout last night and it was simple, yet challenging and I felt the burn and was sweating like crazy.  I am very athletic, in good shape, and work out a lot and I really enjoyed this.  I have done programs like T25 and P90X3 and this workout is totally comparable.  Great job Ashley.  Look forward to trying the rest of the workouts on the dvd.",1416355200,27,387,4.175675675675675

6608328,5,B00N35J8VQ,Great workouts and I love the ability to choose different workouts so it doesn't get monotonous.,1487808000,2,96,5.0625
6608329,5,B00N35J8VQ,I love this video. It is one of my go to videos right now. I work out fairly regularly and run a couple times a week. I have been sore each time I have  done these workouts. I think my favorite is head to toe but they are all fun and challenging.,1483488000,,246,3.730769230769231
6608330,4,B00N35J8VQ,"I like these short HIIT workouts. You really feel like you're working up a sweat without the moves being too difficult or tedious. The instructor, Ashley doesn't talk too much and her two helpers show what the more intense and less intense version of each exercise is like. Each twenty-five minute segment flies by but I'm sweating and panting at the end. I'm also feeling after effects of the burn. Good DVD to add to my regimen!",1480636800,3,430,4.597402597402597
6608331,3,B00N35J8VQ,I have been doing Jillian workouts. They are a little more challenging than this one. This would be a great video for a beginner. We all have to start somewhere.,1480204800,3,161,4.4
6608332,5,B00N35J8VQ,Absolutely love this video! It's an awesome workout and really truly is only 25 minutes. You will be drenched in sweat when you're done. If you're looking for a challenging quick workout this is a great HIIT workout,1476662400,,215,4.684210526315789

6608339,2,B00N35J8VQ,"I previewed all the workouts on this DVD first, but when I started to finally try one of the workouts the other day, after a few minutes, I turned it off and put on the Chris Freytag HIIT Series DVD.  I do like Ashley Borden ... have been to her website and seen her on TV appearances, and I do her Foam Rolling YouTube video (fantastic!), but I just could not ""connect"" with these HIIT workouts so far.",1462752000,8,403,4.166666666666667
6608340,5,B00N35J8VQ,"I love this workouts. 25 minutes long, burns a lot of calories. There are 4 videos. The best if you want something really hard its the whole body. The core HIIT workout is the easier but without being lost of time.
Great when you want to burn a lot of calories in a short period of time.",1461715200,2,287,4.052631578947368

6608342,4,B00N35J8VQ,"Heart pumping, sweat inducing workout that is challenging but doable. You can choose to complete a whole body workout or just focus on targeted areas. Either way, it's worth the time.  I like this particular HIIT DVD because the moves produce results, without the painful stress on joints some other HIIT workouts cause. It's a great addition to my workout routine.",1461196800,2,365,4.983606557377049
6608343,3,B00N35J8VQ,"I don't believe one workout by itself burns 900 calories. The whole concept of HIIT is that it burns calories during the workout and gives you a post workout calorie burn as well. But if it does burn 900 calories then it's the easiest burn of my life cause I did not feel challenged at all. I just did the Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 program for the second time around and that still kicks me in the butt in a way I feel like I got a good workout in. This did not. I also find them to be boring. No real music plays, and the location is dark and plain. She has no real personality when she talks, etc. if you're an intermediate to hard level exerciser than I wouldn't recommend this DVD.",1459209600,3,689,4.111111111111111
6608344,1,B00N35J8VQ,"I watched each segment through for a few minutes to get an idea of what this workout was about.  Needless to say, after previewing, I didn't bother wasting my time even doing it. There was a lot of standing around, the moves looked boring and there is no way that anyone would burn 900 calories even doing all four of them!  I'll stick with Turbo Fire, Michelle Dozois, Taebo and Jeanette Jenkins!  Don't bother unless you don't care about burning calories!",1456963200,4,457,4.617283950617284
6608345,4,B00N35J8VQ,"After reading the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure about purchasing this one, but I'm glad I did.  Ashley's not too annoying, and she definitely needs a better warm up and cool down--but that said, I really love one of these workouts.  The other three are good, and challenging, but I felt that the Lower Body HiiT was the best. I felt it the next day, and that, for me, is a sign of a great workout!

I workout six days a week; typically workout pretty hard, and I felt that these were a good challenge. You'll sweat, you'll burn calories, and like I said, your bottom half will definitely feel it!",1454025600,9,595,4.342342342342342
6608346,1,B00N35J8VQ,"Very misleading title! I bought this dvd bc I'm an avid workout junkie.. I usually use Jillian Michaels and sweat my butt off from her dvd's. This one says 900 calorie workout burn- I was interested!! I did each section of this dvd, which is 25 min at a time, and barely burned 93 calories for EACH 25 minute section. Huh?? Doing all 4 sections, which would be almost 2 HOURS of your time, u may burn around 400 calories. Who has time for that??

The warm is awkward and doesn't really do anything. The intervals are so slow and then they gave u a minute break between each set. What a waste of time. Save your money on this one.",1453248000,5,629,4.198347107438017
6608347,5,B00N35J8VQ,Intense workout. Love the instructor.,1450742400,,37,6.6
6608348,5,B00N35J8VQ,"I haven't tried all the workouts, but did the full body today. I loved it! If the others are similar, I will go to this DVD regularly. The moves were not complicated, but the combination of moves made this a hard workout. I could tell my heart rate was in a good zone and I could just make it through the last sets. I started with medium weight (for me) so I know I can increase as needed. The warm up was fine and the cool down, as well. I stretch longer because I need to. I think this is a good value, too. It has 4 workouts, so it can fill a week if split up. I look forward to the other workouts.",1449360000,5,601,3.8548387096774195
6608349,4,B00N35J8VQ,"I do the first 2 for one workout. After both, you should have a good sweat. The next workout the last 2 workouts and that should get you sweating as well.",1447545600,,154,4.0
6608350,5,B00N35J8VQ,kinda get bored with the circuits but it is a good workout,1447113600,,58,3.9166666666666665
6608351,1,B00N35J8VQ,"Ashley does her routine with two other people to vary fitness levels.  High intensity intervals of the same exercises are done, standing up and going back down to the floor quickly over and over. I felt like I was in the Marines. it was BORING! I can't believe all the stars.  It was cheaply done too!",1444608000,2,301,4.357142857142857

6608353,1,B00N35J8VQ,900 calorie burn??? This is very easy to get through even if you are a beginner.  The workouts are not very long and I didn't even come close to breaking a sweat.,1440979200,,162,4.0625

6608355,5,B00N35J8VQ,"I need to lose 70lbs. I purchased the video because of the title; however, i am impressed on the intensity/sweat of the workout and the short amount of time i have to dedicate to it.  Just when I feel that I cant go on, it is time to rest or time to end.  I feel that this is abrealistic, engaging and not over-my-circumstances type of workout that I will be able to stick to until I master it.  Thank you.  It is very well produced for thise of us who need to start excercising and want to feel the intense burn without completely loosing our stamina.",1440288000,2,552,4.179245283018868
6608356,3,B00N35J8VQ,"Really a great circuit in each of these workouts, but she talks way too much and takes way too much break in time between exercises. So if you are an advanced exerciser like me, the only way to use this DVD is to watch it and skip through all her Bologna talking lol. Just being honest. If you are a beginner to moderate this is perfect because you may want a break but for advance folks I'm not sure this will push them beyond any plateau.",1438214400,3,440,4.127906976744186
6608357,4,B00N35J8VQ,Practical and intense. In a few minutes you can realize a a good workout that will make you lose a lot of calories.,1436054400,2,115,4.043478260869565
6608358,2,B00N35J8VQ,"Good for beginners, but there's too much down time between exercises to get a good work out in. It would take several hours doing this to burn 900 calories.",1435017600,2,156,4.413793103448276
6608359,5,B00N35J8VQ,"I am sorry to admit that because this workout DVD is brought to us by Spri I thought this workout DVD was going to be a low budget production.  Boy was I wrong.  I was totally impressed and feel that this workout DVD is a great value offering four great workouts.  I doubled up the first day with upper body HiiT and lower body HiiT and I still felt my legs talking to me two days later. What I love about these workouts is that they don't have the same format for each one (like other programs).  Ashley changes it up.  The upper body workout uses a 45 seconds on 15 seconds off workload; lower body HiiT has a section A which is a ladder (OMG THIS ONE!) and a section B which are two tabatas; core has varied reps and head to toe has varied reps 10, 8, 6, 4 going down the ladder after a completed section.  I could tell that Ashley is very knowledgeable and considering I have a library of hundreds of workout DVDs I can't believe I haven't heard of her before.  I am definitely going to be doing more workouts with Ashley Borden.",1434412800,8,1033,4.160804020100502

6608364,2,B00N35J8VQ,This video was a huge disappointment. I had been doing Jillian Michaels for awhile and wanted to change it up. I'm not in peek physical condition and this was too easy. However would be good for someone just starting out,1431129600,2,220,4.525
6608365,4,B00N35J8VQ,I like the workouts. They will give you a great workout in a short amount of time. The variation will keep you working out different parts of the body. My main complaint is some of the talking by Ashley. I would prefer less talk during the workouts. I don't need constant talking to motivate me.,1428883200,,295,4.381818181818182
6608366,3,B00N35J8VQ,"I was a little disappointed with these workouts, I really didn't find them to be that hard, I didn't even sweat through most of them.  I don't believe that each workout will burn 900 calories, I think it's more like you will burn 900 calories if you do the entire dvd at once.

6608370,3,B00N35J8VQ,"As a personal trainer, I don't even need to see the workout to know that its an extreme exaggeration to claim you can burn 900 calories in a 25-min workout.

6608377,4,B00N35J8VQ,"I like it! There are 4 HIIT workouts to choose from - a Head to Toe HIIT, Upper Body HIIT, Lower Body HIIT and Hard Core HIIT. All are approximately 25 minutes with warm up & cool down included. It is a fast paced workout, resembling circuit training at times, but fast & effective. The instructor is informative and friendly. There is a beginner & advanced person in the background to assist you at your level. On days I do not have a lot of time, I will do a fast 25 min. workout, on other days I combine two of the workouts together.  This is definitely a moderate DVD, not too difficult, you do need some stamina for the Lower Body HIIT workout - but certainly not so advanced where you couldn't get through it. The only minor thing I don't like about this DVD is that the warm up & cool downs are the same or extremely similar for each workout. I personally like a variety in the warm up & cool down.

6608380,4,B00N35J8VQ,"My background: I am a pretty fit mom, and I workout 6 times a week mostly using Jillian Michaels' DVDs.

I bought this dvd on Amazon for $7.56, which I believe is a pretty good deal considering there are 4 different 25 minute workouts to choose from.  Half hour workout sessions are perfect for me between my full time job & parental obligations.

One MIGHT be able to burn 900 calories if they did all 4 workouts back to back, but who has time for that?  With that being said, this DVD has a very misleading title. I'm also not very sweaty at the end of these workouts (Jillian Michaels makes me SWEAT!).

Don't get me wrong though, these are still very good workouts, which is why I'm still rating this a 4 star.  Ashley Borden has great cues & a motivating attitude. The workouts require minimal equipment & space. In addition, all of your muscles will be worked!",1420416000,36,866,4.415094339622642
