7202534,4,B00XWV8XKS,"This wasn't my favorite of Katie's films, but still a good one.  I think the script could have been written a little better, to make it a little more believable about her life, and why she left her career, her spouse, etc.  Katie is one of my favorite actresses, for her work on and off the big screen, but I think this role wasn't really made for her, as it doesn't highlight or play on her strong suits as an actress.",1439078400,2,419,4.160493827160494
7202535,3,B00XWV8XKS,"This movie didn't do anything for me, though there wasn't anything glaringly bad about it, just meh...  I'd save it for a rental, which I wish I'd done.",1438819200,,152,4.428571428571429
7202536,5,B00XWV8XKS,"Very realistic film beautifully showing a part of the American physical and psychosocial landscape. Good DP, excellent photography. Solid, accurate writing. Superb actors. Emotional integrity. No grandstanding. No exaggeration. About the American past, present and future. Values, gender issues...also, especially: about old timey music, the musician's life, the communities and then equally realistic about the punitive world of angry spouses and their high priced attorneys. I've experienced all of this. I lived my life this way for a while, old timey music, traveling, busking for the night's food. It is a life of finding a place to put your things down in order to play. Because you live to play. Play, practice, jam, busk, play, practice, jam, busk.
Also, maybe people don't realize what a divide there was (is?) between the original repetoire of old-timey music and contemporary urge to create an independent musical and narrative voice in the same style...for that reason, it was more than emotional reserve this musician had to to ercome in order to generate his own material. Because the original impetus for most of the musicians, myself and those I knew, is for accurate replication, not for fame and fortune, the push is to become an transcendent player living deeply within the music while playing. Where you are doesn't really matter when absorbed and uplifted in this way. This is what is so utterly realistic about this film. I am pleased that this private world gained the attention of someone who recognized she had something to learn when she first met the original musician this story is modeled on.",1438300800,16,1621,5.143939393939394

7202592,3,B00XWV8XKS,"Jackie and Ryan was entertaining, but not overly engaging. The story of the chance meeting of a down on his luck travelling musician and a big city single mother returning home followed a predictable plot line with enough emotion to keep it interesting. When two musicians fall in love, there is bound to be romance. This backed by the idyllic countryside setting make it a pleasant view. The movie reminded me of one of a dime store romance novels that is pleasant but with little in the way of discernible climax. It has a happy ending, and that's what we are all hoping for.",1452297600,,577,4.5576923076923075

7202597,3,B00XWV8XKS,Not what I expected it to be but not terrible either. I wanted a more powerful love story but it was adequate. My partner enjoyed watching it as well. It was funny that Katherine Heigl had to have someone else voice-over hers while singing.,1451865600,,240,4.4772727272727275

7202600,2,B00XWV8XKS,"This seems like a good idea on paper, maybe.  Hey, let's have some fresh faced, healthy looking young woman from Ogden Utah go back home from a bad marriage to a nasty guy in New York City...where she reconnects with Real People who do Real Work and play Real Music.  One of these Real People is a drifter who rides boxcars and plays some of that Real Music.  I tried to like it, played it on two successive days, mostly because I liked seeing Utah.  That was the best thing about the film, in my opinion.

It tries to be heartfelt, tears at you with talk of hard times and people making hard choices.  As another reviewer mentioned this would have been a great film in the 30's.  I could see Pete Seeger riding the rails and singing these songs of the people.  Now it falls flat because it's fake.",1451001600,,798,4.273333333333333

But how many folkies are ridin' the rails to busking gigs these days? Ok, there's a nice little romance, a poignant side story, as the main character tries in vane to get in touch with his friend.
There's some nice music and scenery, but it all doesn't hang together. There are just too many threads that come unraveled like a bad sweater. They try for a bitter/sweet ending, but it comes across as, let's make this an arty tearjerker. O well...nice try.",1450742400,,563,4.475728155339806

7202606,2,B00XWV8XKS,"Hmm, when Verizon Wireless gave this away around Thanksgiving, I thought...what a perfect movie for the Mrs!  Unfortunately, this story...just doesn't quite make it.

The overall summary of the story (attempting no spoilers), is a single mother who moves back to Ohio with her mother and is struggling to re-start her life after leaving her husband in NYC.  She crosses paths with a guitar slinging, train jumping, wishful thinking man and the two of them form this bond.

This story, with a few changes could of been exciting...or a least mildly entertaining.  My wife thought it was terrible--she is no movie critic when it comes to chick flicks.  But the problem was, this movie wasn't engaging any particular genre.  It wasn't romantic or funny at all it was more tragedy than anything.  You can tell that the producer wanted to make this movie very reflective to the viewer...just long periods of silence watching someone do a normal task doesn't quite cut it.  The only highlight my wife and I had of it was the occasional soundtrack was pleasant to our ears.  Frankly, I was surprised Katherine Heigl who has been in a number of great movies was in this movie to begin with.  Save yourself 2 hours and look elsewhere.",1449792000,,1224,4.780952380952381

I only bought it because I was a ""featured extra"" which means the AD liked something I did and took several individual shots of me from several angles, and if it got through final cuts I'd be center screen for a couple seconds.  Since it never got really extensive theatrical release I had to get the DVD to find out and, as I expected, it didn't get through edit so I can only see myself in the background a few times..",1449532800,,448,4.1976744186046515

7202625,4,B00XWV8XKS,"When I moved to Seattle, I met a young woman who had all her limbs. Not too long after, I saw her with prosthetic legs from about the knees down: she had slipped while hopping a freight train (luckily she was with a friend when it happened, so didn't bleed out trackside).
Jackie & Ryan is not that kind of story. While I wish more time had been spent on [railroad] tramp life in this picture, this story about a man, a woman, and music is complete ""as is."" Nothing fancy, just a visual little ditty made to put a smile on your face... and it works.

Katherine Heigl looked so familiar but I couldn't place it; IMDb reminded me that she was the blonde bombshell alien in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roswell/dp/B006286CII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roswell</a>&nbsp;(15 years ago!) ... Another face I was struggling to place was Sheryl Lee's; turns out she was the [dead] Laura Palmer from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks/dp/B0076HNCTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks</a>!
Up and coming actor Ben Barnes plays Ryan (look at the cover of the first Bob Dylan album and you'll see who he's channeling), and Clea Duvall rounds out the ""big names"" in the cast. Barnes surprises us with his talent as a musician, thereby lending serious credibility to the screenwriter's vision. I don't much listen to folk music, but his final song in the film is so stirring you can't help but feel a wee bit of awe even if folk isn't your cup of tea.

If Jackie & Ryan has a flaw, it's that the characters don't. Sure, some people might point to Ryan using freight trains as transportation, but that's a lifestyle choice, not a character flaw. Others may point to a failed marriage as Jackie's flaw, but she doesn't seem to be the problem there.
I usually rail against what I term the Standardized Hollywood Happy Ending (SHHE), but Jackie & Ryan is a feel good film from beginning to end and it wouldn't have been proper to have it end any differently than it does.",1448496000,,2052,5.086053412462908

7202642,5,B00XWV8XKS,"Amazing music, sweet love story and well done Ben. It's hard to believe that he learned how to play guitar in only 6 weeks, most people can't play that well after a life time of playing.",1440547200,3,186,4.194444444444445
7202643,1,B00XWV8XKS,This was a regrettable sap fest with bad songs and twangy violins. The male star complete with tattoos on his knuckles was a kingpin street dumb loser who latches on to Heigi on what could be her last picture as the acting was atrocious and  an obvious attempt to be the folksy version of Once a truly magnificent movie about ships that pass in the night. Touching and fine. This was about two ships that CRASHED in the night and sunk with no survivors. The child custody issue was a trumped up conspiracy to actually invent some  kind of story as the rest was a hillbilly swan song for the lot. I would avoid this like bad crawfish ya all!,1440201600,,640,4.325

7202647,5,B00XWV8XKS,"Very good movie, good story- with lots of good music- actually played and sung by the actors, not faked or overdubbed. The song ""Last Kind Word""- by an obscure blues lady from the '30's- Geechie Wiley a highlight.",1439683200,,213,4.631578947368421
7202648,2,B00XWV8XKS,It was aight. Katherine Heigel's career sure has taken a nose dive.,1439596800,,67,4.666666666666667

7202651,5,B00XWV8XKS,"The movie had real heart, something that can get lost in modern day movies with the push for so much CGI.  Ben Barnes leads the way in this movie with hope and the love of music to show the depth of the connection music can have in someone's soul.  Although, yes there were parts that made me think ""Who in there right mind would ever do that in real life?"" The basis of finding yourself even if you didn't realize you were looking really captures the essence of the movie.",1439078400,6,473,4.2444444444444445

8716994,1,B00XWV8XKS,This is a bootleg copy and not even the right movie.  Some kind of Jack the Reaper movie....seriously.  I just want my money back.  This was the second time...same Jack the Reaper movie both times.,1503273600,,197,4.571428571428571
8716995,5,B00XWV8XKS,"Loved the movie.  Very original.  So well written, directed, and acted.  I must watch out for this director's work in the future.  Thank God for ""independent"" films or we'd all be adolescents!.  In fact, if I can stop being lazy I intend to get in touch with the producers to see if I can mail the writer/director thanking her directly myself.

In a different vein, I think Ms. Heigl absolutely correct in her criticism of her movie Knocked Up, which, in fact I enjoyed very much.  So amazing that people can get so riled up when someone expresses the truth.",1502150400,,558,4.52
