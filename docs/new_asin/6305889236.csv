7898685,5,6305889236,"One of the best dubs I have ever seen. The dialogue is much better than the subtitles. The only thing I preferred in the sub is the word ""Sifu"" meaning master in Chinese. The action is as quick as the dialogue, Reminds me of when I used to watch Speed Racer as a child. The dubists have to be quick to get their dialogue to match their Chinese counterpart. If you love Jackie Chan or any other comedy martial artists such as Stephen Chow you will definitely love this movie.",1494028800,,474,4.277777777777778

7898688,1,6305889236,"This refers to the Amazon digital ""HD"" version of this movie:

The video quality is atrocious. It looks like a DVD was upscale to HD then encoded at a very low bitrate.
This is not a result of streaming or bandwidth, I have a very fast connection and watch both iTunes and Netflix videos in HD and they look great.
The video quality on the ""HD"" copy of this was so awful I requested a refund for my purchase.
Buyer beware.",1452211200,,422,4.209876543209877
7898689,5,6305889236,"This movie is incredible! As are most of the films in the Sammo Hung catalog...action, some of the finest Martial Arts ever filmed...I just bought this because i only had access to it through youtube, and it just doesn't do the film justice. It will skip and pause, due to my ancient computer but, still i want it in it's best form.....i have watched it over 15 times, sometimes twice a day. IT IS THAT GOOD! It has all i need in a movie-classic humor, action, romance, characters who appeal to you and you follow them throughout. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.",1401667200,,577,4.504761904761905
7898690,5,6305889236,"Samo Hung and company are amazing with the long, short spears, along with some super sword work.  A story of two friends caught up in a personal  competition, and a long time rival who wants there lives.  Maybe the best  weapon fights out there, you'll have to see it to believe it.",967334400,2,282,4.365384615384615

7898692,4,6305889236,"This movie is fast action. The fights are highly skilled. This movie  mainly only displays weapon fights. Here you can see how cool samo hung  used to be before he lost his talent, character, and culture in America",960249600,,214,4.605263157894737
