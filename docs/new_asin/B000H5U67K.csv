8136660,5,B000H5U67K,"I have been watching a few of the films involving indie film actor Stuart Brennan, and I think this is his directorial debut on this six pack 'The Innocent'. The sound isn't great in some places, but the score is incredible, there are some great animated titles, and the story is very solid. Some excellent performances, but most of all the direction sets this film apart from all the others. I'm still trying to work out how they pulled off the twisting sepia shot with the axe?? Apparently this film is coming out soon on its own, and rightly so. If it's got some documentaries it's worth the buy!!",1206921600,,600,4.513761467889908

These movies are a throwback to the early '60s type of drive-in theater gorefests that were once popular with teens. If you're looking for big-budget state of the art special effects and top rank actors this series may not be right for you. Fans of murder, mayhem and maniacs will not be disappointed by this little collection, however.
