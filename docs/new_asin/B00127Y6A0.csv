8244651,5,B00127Y6A0,"This is a poorly acted campy film which I loved because it is a satire on many levels. After all the world sinks, except Japan, the island nation becomes the home to foreigners who over run the country. Japan still wants to maintain its identity and culture. The problem of the film is that every scene, every word, is a satire of something, making the viewer engage with the film.

In one scene we see Japanese eat whales and bald eagles because they are not protected while bashing hungry foreigners going after their sacred carp. US stars must now prostitute themselves and a little guy from North Korea wants to run the world. In one scene our starlet talks about ""a country with only yellow monkeys"" which made it by the PC police. Even the size of Japanese manhood makes the satire list. The film laughs at Japanese films which ""look so cheap.""

Global warming causes the sinking and the theme of the film is that life is short on this earth, we are global and need to get along. It is all about sharing the mitt.

I loved this film. I can see where most people won't.
