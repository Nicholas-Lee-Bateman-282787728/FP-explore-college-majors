7695802,5,B01D01K5Z0,"I try to see a lot of indie films to support filmmakers who are not out to make blockbusters with an explosion every five seconds. A lot of those films, alas, are not so great (I wish theyd added explosions, sometimes!) but every now and then a small, quirky film with actors I haven't seen before comes along and surprises me.  WITH CHILD is that kind of a movie. It was very smartthe female lead Leslie Lewis is a physics professionwith intelligent but unpretentious dialogue. She was fabulous. THe whole story was very touching and heartwarming. I cared about the characters. I look forward to discovering the writer/director Titus Heckels next filmeven if he does end up doing something with car chases.",1468195200,4,707,4.795081967213115
7695803,5,B01D01K5Z0,"A touching and funny movie about a recently widowed man, struggling to raise his daughter on his own.  One minute you have tears in your eyes, the next minute you're laughing out loud. The characters are intricate and complex, just like real people!  The comedy was perfectly executed by the actors and were well timed to provide levity throughout the story.",1468108800,,358,4.852459016393443
7695804,5,B01D01K5Z0,"WITH CHILD tells the touching story of a widowed construction worker and his efforts to rebuild his life as a single dad while struggling with custody issues as well as the romantic overtures of his eccentric new boss. Kerry van der Griend and Leslie Lewis co-star as Auden and Petra in this unique indie film thats already earned a Best World Showcase nomination at the 2015 SoHo International Film Festival as well as a Leo Award nomination for Best Production Design from the Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Foundation of British Columbia.

A baby girl left in his care.
A job to find. Its hard to bear.
Construction work looks very dim,
for baby needs to be with him.

And who will hire him with this child?
Surprise in store -- a woman wild!
Why would she want these two at work?
Do dangers lie and evils lurk?

WITH CHILD makes us care deeply for
dad and daughter plus much more.
The boss may seem weird at first sight.
But soon its clear she wants whats right.

WITH CHILD moved me with its big heart.
Its worth a look like all great art.

 Three years ago, Titus Heckel wrote WITH CHILD with my friend Kerry van der Griend in mind to play the lead, Leslie Lewis explains. Kerry suggested me for the role of Petra, and when I read the script, I thought it would be a good fit for my first film as lead producer. It has been an utter joy to work with this team, and I love the message of the film: What we choose now affects our past.

Lewis made a wise decision when she agreed to portray Petra. She projects power, quirkiness and vulnerability in this key role, and I look forward to seeing her in many more movies. Van der Griend also impressed me with his sensitive performance of a father facing so many obstacles. And Lori Kokotailo deserves recognition for her no-nonsense turn as the childs aunt. But remember W. C. Fields warning to actors about appearing with children? In this case, the darling baby almost crawls away with the entire film. What a charmer!

Based on a true story, WITH CHILD benefits considerably from caring direction by Titus Heckel, who also wrote the poignant -- and often amusing --  screenplay. I absolutely love this unusual indie film!",1461283200,3,2178,4.493670886075949
7695805,5,B01D01K5Z0,"I had the opportunity to preview With Child and the genuine pleasure to interview filmmakers Leslie Lewis and director/writer Titus Heckle on my Blog Talk Radio show, Comedy Concepts last spring. Leslie Lewis as Petra  and Kerry Van Der Griend  as Auden shine in this warm and touching film of survival,  revival and love under the most unusual of circumstances. An expertly film well-crafted and full of humor, surprises and revelations. I loved this gem of an independent film and could see it again and again. My favorite line Its my guitar let me play it.

I saw this last spring at the Soho Film Festival when visiting NYC and was really surprised by how good this movie was. It was definitely NOT another dark indie movie, nor was it a traditional hollywood story either. I loved the real life feel to it all, particularly in the relationship between the two leads. The plotabout an unprepared construction worker father taking care of an infantcould have been corny but instead everything was handled with intelligence, humor, and grace. I definitely want to share this movie with my friends, particularly the young dads, since anyone can relate to the themes of overcoming loss and finding love again.",1460592000,4,683,4.991228070175438

7695839,1,B01D01K5Z0,"There was no chemistry between the lead characters. The female lead was robotic. The male lead did not convince me that he loved his child. It was way too soon after his wife's death to have any sort of interest in another woman. The sister-in-law was shrill and super annoying. The baby was handled irresponsibly and placed into precarious situations, plus there was obviously someone off-screen constantly drawing her attention to make her smile, laugh, and coo.

This movie wasn't funny, wasn't sad, wasn't well-acted, wasn't well-directed, the characters weren't likeable, and it really didn't seem to have a point. There was nothing to grab on to to like.",1511827200,,660,5.055045871559633

I see where they were trying to go. I was kind of intrigued by the trailer.and reading the synopsis...but the acting got me sometimes. I don't know if it was the lines they were given or the direction they went for, or what but it just was stretching it. It was stretching everything and yeah. I can't give it one star because the storyline/plot was good and kind of different...(it's been done before) but the acting just killed it for me. It was just a little to strange.",1511740800,,481,4.415730337078652

7695843,2,B01D01K5Z0,This is an odd movie.  I would have turned it off but I kept waiting for it to get better and to find out what happened.  The actors (or characters) were just so weird.  I had a hard time knowing if it was how it was written or if it was actually their acting.  Perhaps a bit of both.  The storyline was good but very very slow. In the end we know what happens (only if you watch the credits!) but not exactly how they got there which is irritating to me.  In the end I wouldn't recommend it.  Just too slow.  The only really likeable character is the baby and she doesn't say or do much.,1506211200,2,588,3.965811965811966
7695844,5,B01D01K5Z0,"Excellent movie - surprisingly funny. You can almost guess the ending from the very beginning, however how that ending is played is quite unexpected. The two main characters have great chemistry between them and the antagonist (the sister in law) does a great job gettting you to hate her from the beginning. If a guy with no experience were to suddenly care for a  newborn, that's exactly how it would go. The viewer is on the edge the whole time just worrying about the baby's safety. This movie is raw and even cold at times yet it's all about the power of love, even unexpected love.",1505779200,3,587,4.537735849056604
7695845,1,B01D01K5Z0,VERY VERY SLOW MOVIE.1 Was waiting for it to pick up but it never did. Not much of a plot. The best part of the entire movie was when a little girl sang a song after the movie was over.,1504569600,,185,3.65

7695847,1,B01D01K5Z0,"This was soooooo painful to watch.  I kept checking the time hoping something of substance would happen.  I was sure that by the end SOMETHING worth watching would happen.  Did the two main characters have Asperger's??? I understand that the female employer was supposed to be strange, but did the father have PDD or was that actor just a terrible actor???

I am so exhausted trying to make sense of this movie.  So they get pregnant with this child in hopes of saving the wife's life, which fails.  Then we watch this lunatic father with autistic characteristics (not sure if this was poor acting or intended) attempt to take care of this infant and struggles to determine if he even loves his daughter.  I felt that the actual story could have made a good movie, but failed in every sense of movie making.

The characters were hard to connect with and there was much better acting by the bit piece actors such as the two guys that worked with the lead character.

7695849,2,B01D01K5Z0,"2 stars. The movie's interesting premise was of a relationship developing between a widowed construction worker with a baby girl and a reclusive single lady who hires him to redo her basement. But I couldn't relate to either main character. Up to the very end, the man was obnoxious, rude, careless with his child, and selfish in not putting her interests first. His tender moments with the baby did not overcome this. The woman was robotic and mechanical, almost devoid of visible emotion, and the movie did not make a case for her attraction to such an obnoxious man. Even her physics experiment was misconstrued, being in optics rather than particle physics, and her claim that it proved that she could change the past (presumably her sad, cloistered childhood) by taking action in the present is not how a quantum physicist would interpret it. The most admirable character was the man's sister in law, because she showed genuine concern for the baby and was willing to pay a steep price for her welfare. But the movie portrayed her as somewhat of a villain for threatening legal action to gain custody, along with her husband. Details in movies don't have to be completely plausible, but when the main relationship has such little plausibility or chemistry, that's going too far.",1502755200,2,1283,4.889908256880734

The subject matter was a very touching one- a widowed father struggling to care for his infant daughter. Yes he was eccentric. Might I add very eccentric! Yet he could have been very comical;but he was not. To top it all off, the film ended so abruptly.

7695855,5,B01D01K5Z0,"Wow! With some really smart dialogue and deadpan humor, director / screenwriter Titus Heckel has created a stunner of a film.  A grieving widower demands his own rigorous honesty in determining his desire and ability to keep his own infant daughter-- she seen mainly in an ergo-type baby carrier, suspended from his neck like a baby pendant. At the same time, he begins a curious and quirky relationship of the carnal kind on a new construction job.  Authentic exploration with a wacky spin in a wonderfully absurd context.

This film moved me with its innocence and intriguing message, that the present influences the past. I'd first read about this notion in an article in Discovery magazine about 6 years ago, so I found it captivating when Leslie Lewis's character, a physics professor, describes the physics behind this seemingly impossible idea.  At times the movie veered close to becoming corny, but managed to stay on the side of sincerity and authenticity. I especially liked Leslie Lewis' performance, she was captivating, quirky, strong and sexy.

It was so refreshing to see a film where I did not see the outcome ahead of time.

7695881,5,B01D01K5Z0,"I got to see this charming film at a friends and family screening in Vancouver. The film had a funny story line, something you wouldn't normally think of--who brings their kid to work, a baby in  a very masculine job, a very masculine environment? It's not a normal predicament, the man in a non-traditional role.

Both characters are quirky in their own way, and there's a sweet mystery to how they come connect. It's a lovely story of how different walks of life can come together to do something. A funny love story. Well worth watching.

7695884,4,B01D01K5Z0,"I had the opportunity to see this at the first public screening, in North Vancouver. I love it when Indie films get seen and am happy to see this has made it to DVD. I've ordered a copy so I can show it to friends. It's been a while since I've seen it, so I don't remember it well enough to write a fresh review now, but I'll copy/paste what I wrote about it on Facebook immediately after viewing it:

""I really liked it. It has a strong screenplay, with excellent unfolding of little bits of the backstory as the film progresses. I loved the visual storytelling too. Nice touches.

The characters were mostly believable, though some of the dialog was a bit stilted and the acting stagey in parts, particularly the sister-in-law, the combination of which diminished the naturalness of the scenes. But the transformation of the main character was totally believable. And the baby was so cute!

There were a couple of times I wished the camera hadn't been handheld, for example in the opening shot, a still-life of pastries on a table. But for the most part the naturalness of handheld was appropriate to the content, or it wasn't noticeable or was on a tripod or dolly and I wasn't aware of any shake.

Overall, some very deep ideas are explored and handled very well: that the choices we make now can effectively rewrite and heal our past. And the challenge of loving aright after loss.

I laughed and got tears in my eyes. A powerful film with emotional complexity. I hope many others get to see it.""

I wish there was an option for 4-1/2 stars.",1469836800,,1546,4.503571428571429
7695885,5,B01D01K5Z0,"I was touched by this movie, and intrigued by its main idea. So often I watch movies where one can see the gears turning, and while done with craft, they feel calculated. This film moved me with its innocence and intriguing message, that the present influences the past. I'd first read about this notion in an article in Discovery magazine about 6 years ago, so I found it captivating when Leslie Lewis's character, a physics professor, describes the physics behind this seemingly impossible idea.  At times the movie veered close to becoming corny, but managed to stay on the side of sincerity and authenticity. I especially liked Leslie Lewis' performance, she was captivating, quirky, strong and sexy. Their unlikely romance inspired me, and I walked away from the movie both emotionally and intellectually stimulated, which I find rarely happens. Very glad I came across this unlikely gem!",1469145600,,893,5.074829931972789
7695886,5,B01D01K5Z0,"I loved this independent film. With Child has an engaging storyline w honest, quirky characters. Leslie Lewis is well poised and gives a remarkable performance with her character. Smart dialogue, makes you think. I enjoyed the metaphors and one liners. The baby in the film was amazing as well and fun to watch. From start to finish, this story runs the gamut of human emotion. I was lucky to order this film dvd on its first run and it sold out by the end of the night! It shipped quickly and arrived just days later. Highly recommend.",1469145600,,536,4.536082474226804
7695887,3,B01D01K5Z0,"With Child,"" written and directed by Titus Heckel, is a comedy-drama about a grieving widowed father trying to raise his child as best he can while navigating  not always smoothly  through a new romantic relationship.

After his wife dies, blue-collar construction worker Auden Price (Kerry van der Griend) is left to care for his 4-month-old daughter, Riley. Against the advice of his overbearing sister-in-law, Karen (Lori Kokotailo), Auden decides to go it alone. After trying to drum up some work, Auden finally lands a job renovating a basement. His new boss, Petra Dell (Leslie Lewis), allows him to bring Riley to work but he is soon overwhelmed and often unwittingly puts Riley in danger while on the job. Petra takes advantage of Audens vulnerable state and strikes up an awkward romance with him just as Karen files for full custody.

This is the kind of film that piles one conflict after another on top of its protagonist, complicating his life to a point where you feel hes going to snap. The circumstances are not uncommon, though movies have traditionally favored stories about single mothers struggling with day-to-day challenges. Its novel and fascinating to see the roles reversed. Auden is a down-to-earth, unassuming guy whos beset by a myriad of responsibilities all at once. Hes a sympathetic character because his heart is in the right place though his hormones might be out of whack when Petra makes her moves. With single-parent households more common now than in previous decades, the film is contemporary and moving.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release.",1468627200,,1600,5.045454545454546
