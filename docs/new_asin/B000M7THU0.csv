2726155,5,B000M7THU0,"I just finished doing this dvd this morning, I have to say if you like lifting weights this is a good one, its slow paced so you can be careful of your form, also there is a bit of cardio but I wouldn't get too excited its very simple, the plyo jumps are slow paced and there cant be more than 12 or 15 in the whole workout, however the ab work is great I think,  I have weak knees right now so I am starting with a low box to build up strength,  I think overall its a good workout, it covers almost all your muscle groups, I like the work for the back also, I am going to use the other classics for more cardio, a low 4 to 6 in box. I also like the weighted floor work,  I like this instructor, her personality is not over the top,",1405468800,4,732,3.8026315789473686
2726156,5,B000M7THU0,"The charm of the instructor helps to get me through this tough workout. As I prefer the Firm workouts that are lighter on aerobics (I'd rather walk or swim) and heavier on the weights, which this is, I find it to be an excellent, thorough workout.

This is one of my favorite Firm workouts. I had it for years on VHS  and just bought it on DVD.  I just turned 70 and I've been doing this kind of workout for a good chunk of my life. I have found as I age that the aerobics on many of the Firm workouts are too strenuous for me, but the weight training just keeps (slowly) getting better. If you are in your sixties or more and have not exercised for many years, this is NOT the place to start. If you are in good shape and pay attention to what your body tells you and keep the weights light the first time or two, you should be fine.",1358640000,16,834,4.0120481927710845
2726157,5,B000M7THU0,"If you're looking for a great workout that emphasizes strength training this is the workout for you (hence the name FIRM Strength)!!! This is a total body workout that will tone and sculpt every muscle in your body. It has a few short aerobic segments interspersed between strength sets to keep the heart rate up. It's about an hour long and you will need various sets of weights, a tall step (14""), an optional barbell and ankle weights. I don't have a barbell. I use dumbbells and they work just fine. If you don't have a tall step you can substitute it with a step stool which can probably be found at Target or Walmart. I find the instructor to be pleasant and cues well. This video was meant to be alternated with its companion video FIRM Cardio which is also a really excellent workout. Bottom line, I highly recommend this workout. It is fun and extremely effective if you stick with it and combine your efforts with clean eating. Nothing changes my body like the classic FIRM workouts!!! GET THIS VIDEO! You will not be disappointed! Especially if you like The FIRM!",1313020800,9,1074,4.569948186528498
2726158,5,B000M7THU0,"If you want to lose pounds, lose inches, and build muscle The Firm is  the right choice I have all the firm videos and FIRM STRENGTH is one of my favorites. If you use it in conjunction  with  FIRM CARDIO you will have great workout results. FIRM STRENGTH is about 60 mins. long it uses a barbell but, you can substitute weights. it also uses a fanny lifter. but any stepup box will do the job. The instructor is very friendly. and her cueing is right on. When you finish this video your body will know it has been worked. I recommend this video to any body who is looking for a good cardio/stength type workout.",1252454400,10,612,4.258620689655173

8166957,5,B000M7THU0,"Firm Strength (originally known as Variety: StrongBody) is a 57 minute cardio + strength (AWT) workout led by Pam Cauthen-Meriwether (in this workout, shes known by her maiden name only). Its part of the 1995 Variety series later named the Cross Trainers. This workout takes place in a faux library/study setting that is different from the usual Classic Firm mansion. Pam is accompanied by several women, including some Firm instructors who went on to lead their own workouts (Allie Del Rio and Kelsie Daniels). For the workout, youll need several sets of dumbbells, an optional barbell, a short step (6 to 8 inches, just for the post warmup stretch), a tall step (12 to 14 inches), and optional ankle weights. Pam and crew use wooden steps, but if you have The Firms Fanny Lifter or TransFIRMer, or the High Step with Risers, that will work too.

After a brief warmup to some nice funky music, and stretch to jazzy music (using the short step as a prop), Pam begins the main workout with the first of three cardio intervals. Its a four-limb tune (using light dumbbells), consisting of samba steps with delt flyes and bicep curls, and step squats with hammer curls (later adding a leg abduction, or side leg lift). Your first strength tune is next, and focuses on the lower body with short sets of lunges and dips, with a set of squats to change sides. The toughest strength set is next: a superset of pushups and triceps French press, performed twice. After a brief set of plyometric jumps and marches, you finish off the triceps work with a short set of tricep kickbacks. A series of tall step leg presses is next (on both legs), followed with a short set of squats to finish. An unusual upper body exercise follows this: T-bar rows, where a barbell is loaded heavy on one end, and a towel is wrapped around the top end of the bar. You straddle the barbell and pull the bar towards you using the towel. Before doing another set of these, Pam does two sets of bicep curls, one medium weight set, and a slow set using very heavy weights. After your final set of T-bar rows, Pam picks up dumbbells for a set of double arm bent rows.

Your second cardio break is next, and requires no equipment. It consists of marches, kicks, plyos, hamstring curls with a sashay step to change sides, and a march-march-triple pattern. After this, its time for the second set of leg press, supersetting with dips (reverse lunges). Ready for more back work? This time, youll perform one arm bent over rows. After working the right side, Pam performs a set of upright rows using a barbell (with other cast members using dumbbells) before doing rows on the left side. The final cardio break is next, and is another four limb tune using light dumbbells. It consists of a step knee, cross mambo and triple step, with a three knee repeater to change sides (its not as complicated as it sounds). Overhead presses and tricep kickbacks are added to this pattern. Once this pattern is performed several times, Pam picks up heavier weights for a set of plie squats with bicep curls, changing the arm movements to upright rows at one point. Following this, you return to the light weights for the original four-limb pattern. Your final standing lower body tune is next, consisting of basic training (toe touches and squats) alternated with a set of squats (using the dumbbells or barbell). Before going down to the floor, Pam performs a tough series for the shoulders: side lateral raises, front raises, and overhead presses (all done with little or no rest between exercises).

After adding ankle weights to both legs, the floor work begins with inner thigh work on the right leg. More tricep work follows, in the form of supine tricep extensions. The first set of ab work follows, consisting of basic crunches and an interesting ribcage pullover/reverse crunch combo (using the dumbbells on the pullover). Following this is the second set, which is a standard series of basic, reverse, and combo crunches (nothing special). Pam then proceeds to doing the inner thigh work on the left leg before removing the ankle weights. Your third and final set of ab work is next, and consists of isometric reverse crunches and reverse crunches with oblique twists. A well deserving two-part final floor stretch concludes the workout.

This is one of my favorite Firm workouts, and has withstood the test of time for me (Ive used it off and on for four years). Its one I come back to time and time again. The pace is slow and methodical, allowing you to use your heavy weights. Pam performs various rep tempos within most sets (3 counts down, 1 up, 2 up and 2 down, singles, etc.). I also love the jazzy music in this workout, as it puts me in a calm mood while Im working hard! That said, there are a few quirks Id like to point out. First, the barbell is used in two different configurationsthen loaded heavy on one end and light on the other (for T-bar rows), followed with evenly balanced weight (for upright rows and squats). The changes are not done in real time, and you must decide whether you want to use a barbell for just the T-bar rows or for the other exercises. If youd like to use both, pause the DVD before the second cardio break, and quickly change your barbell. If you don't have a barbell, you can do either one of two things during the T-bar rows:
-Do both sets in the double arm bent row position, or
-Do a set of 16 one arm rows with the right arm, perform the biceps work, then do 16 rows with the left arm (keep count yourself, since Pam does rep tempo changes on the second set of T-bar rows).

The rest of the workout can easily be performed with dumbbells. Regarding the cardio breaks, they are fairly low-intensity, and primarily there to help you catch your breath and flush the lactic acid out of your hard-working muscles. Finally, the first two sets of ab work are performed with ankle weights. If you have back problems, be very careful with using ankle weights. You may want to forgo them entirely, and just use a dumbbell on the upper inner thigh (during the inner thigh work). If you don't mind the slightly dated look of this workout, its one I highly recommend for intermediate and advanced level exercisers. Beginners who have familiarity with basic weight training moves can use no weights or light weights, and build up to using heavier weights.",1490400000,20,6346,4.622340425531915
