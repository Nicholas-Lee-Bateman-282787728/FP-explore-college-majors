6339745,4,B00J9BZ4KC,"I was lucky  last fall , when Encore shown most of the series . I remember watching this show , when in High School ,I always liked James Arness. I saw the first season available , an will buy that next month . I was also happy to see the second season coming out on DVD an had a date sometime in the summer of 2014 , and recently I saw it say Unavailable before it was released . Perhaps a problem with whom they were going buy them from or , it cant be viewed on American players either way is a bummer, I was thinking of buying that too in the fall . How the West Was Won ,was a very good show many good guest stars , since Westerns are not being made much this TV series was one of the last production on a Tv screen every week .I hope Amazon gets whatever is delaying  the release , only that We been waiting almost 40 years for it to be on DVD.",1402790400,12,850,3.8238636363636362
6339746,5,B00J9BZ4KC,"Super Thrilled that Season Two is finally being released in the US! Season One was good but Season Two is the best! Get ready for guest stars galore! Christopher Lee, Ricardo Montelban,William Shatner, Lloyd Bridges, etc. Whoever approved this DVD release at Warner Home Video - Thanks!!!

UPDATE: DVDS have arrived and I'm loving it! Quality on par with Season One - Very Good. Enjoying all the epic guest stars and great stories.

Gotta admit, re-watching this classic TV series makes me feel like a kid again.

Just one season to go now (Season Three) and my How the West Was Won collection will finally be complete!",1396396800,48,619,4.766355140186916

6339979,5,B00J9BZ4KC,"We watched this series years ago when it first was released and loved it then.  My husband was just saying how he wished it was on DVD.  I checked and found that it was so I got it for him for a gift.  He was genuinely surprised and we have been enjoying the whole thing.  We just started the first season.  So many actors are amazing in this series.  Bruce Boxlitner, James Arness, and Finola Flannagan.  She is one of my favorites.  If you are a western fan at all go for this one!  It is worth every penny and you will love it.  It also has Tim Matheson who is a personal crush of mine.  I can look at that guy all day, whether he acted or just read a phonebook out loud.  We are talking HOT!  He plays an outlaw who is part of an outlaw gang that recruits Luke while he is on the run. I can't even tell you how many other great actors that were a part of the series.  I love some of Zeb Maccahan's lines.",1424217600,,908,3.9175824175824174
6339980,5,B00J9BZ4KC,Excellent series have watched both Season One & Two enjoyed both of them . Have looked at buying Season Three but disappointed it only appears to come in Part1 & Part2 format but if they  ever put it together as one set of D.V.D's as they did in Season One &Two that would be more viable as well as economy buying. We will wait and see other than that I highly recommend both Season One & Two well worth adding to your western library.,1424131200,2,435,4.178571428571429

My family watched a series called ""Hawkeye"", then ""The Chisolms"" then Season one of this and now we are enjoying the heck out of season two. By the way if you like this kind of stuff, Hawkeye was also very good, and the Chisholms (good but not as good) Update- we finished watching season two and it was all wrapped up nicely at the end for all stories that were going on.

6340060,2,B00J9BZ4KC,"I bought this because I was in it.  I played a trapper in Part 4 on Disc 3, toward the end where James Arness rides up and we have a conversation.  It was a lot of fun working with Arness, the only big star in this overblown, melodramatic miniseries.  That said, if you are a fan of turgid television, this will suit you very well.  And be sure to watch for me!
  The original HTW3 was of course the Cinerama feature film, an altogether different animal, and an American classic.",1412985600,,479,4.266666666666667

6340078,3,B00J9BZ4KC,The episodes were too long and repetitive. The rehash of prior segments at the beginning of each episode were too long. Also many of the scenes were dragged out.

6340112,4,B00J9BZ4KC,"How the West Was Won: The Complete Second Season stars James Arness (Gunsmoke) as Zeb Macahan, a rugged mountain man who had spent ten years in the Dakota Territory before returning to Virginia, where his brother Timothys family was preparing to make a long trek west. Shortly after they set off, the Civil War broke out. Timothy returned east and his wife Kate was killed in an accident, leaving the four Macahan children in Zebs care.

The series, based on the 1962 Cinerama film of the same name, was filmed in spectacular settings in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and Southern California. Borrowing from the earlier Wagon Train series, the TV show dealt with adventures encountered on the way west.  Zeb and company faced daily struggles  run-ins with the army and the law, and life-or-death situations. The second season cast included Eva Marie Saint and Bruce Boxleitner. Guest stars included Ricardo Montalban, William Shatner, Tim Matheson, and Lloyd Bridges.

The 6-disc DVD set includes all 14 parts of the 1978 season. There are no bonus features.",1407974400,8,1053,5.0344827586206895

6340118,4,B00J9BZ4KC,"This series brings back a lot of memories of the late 1970s when I was about 12 and loved the West and Native Americans (and still do!).  At that age I didn't know enough to see through some of the silliness so I just enjoyed it for what it was.  Years later I realize that some of the storyline was quite foolish, such as the premise that the US could have a war with Russia because the Sioux took captive (with good reason) two of their royal subjects.  Also, many of the Sioux warriors looked downright funny.  One of them looks just like Al Bundy (actor Ed O'Neil from Married with Children) in a scene when they show the Russian character - Sergei - being held by an actor dressed as an Indian (if you wish to see it for yourself, go to You Tube and look up ""How the west was won (aka The Macahans) Episode 4 part 10"" ... from about 7:00 to 7:45).

Easily, the best part of the series was the Luke Macahan storyline followed by the doings of Zeb Macahan.  Luke's relationship with Hillary reminds me of John and Aeryn (Farscape).  The funniest character is Luke's younger brother Josh.  Almost everything he does goes wrong.  He's the guy that would walk into a dark house with a killer on the loose and not turn on the lights.  Overall, this series is a lot of fun and there is certainly a lot to watch.  And don't forget about the Centennial TV series, too.  They were both on TV around the same time... those were the days!  Into the West from 2005 pales in comparison to these two series if you ask me.

One last thing, after seeing Ricardo Montalban as a Sioux chief after all these years, I didn't realize just how in shape he was.  But it's hard to look at him and not hear the words, ""Ze plane! Ze plane!""",1406419200,2,1718,4.226993865030675
6340119,5,B00J9BZ4KC,"James Arness stars in this epic mini series from 1978, brilliantly photographed scenerios, an exciting frontier saga that is so much more entertaining than the original cinerama movie from which it is based. WB Video has even included a 4 page episode guide of this 14 part 900 minute season. And each exciting episode ends in a cliffhanger. James Arness is superb as Zeb Macahan, looks mighty handsome in his deerskin Davy Crockett outfit and his stetson hat, his character is as heroic as Matt Dillon was though his shaggy hair is a bit greyer than we remember him by. This sprawling saga also costars Bruce Boxleitner from Scarecrow And Mrs King as his nephew Luke, guest stars include Lloyd Bridges from Sea Hunt as a town sheriff, Ricardo Montalban from Fantasy Island as a Sioux Indian chief, Brian Keith from Family Affair as a cavalry general and Christopher Lee from Dracula movies as a Russian royalty, and that's just in the first episode alone. Guest stars in later episodes include Richard Basehart, Tim Matheson, Iron Eyes Cody, Vera Miles, Eric Braeden, Kay Lenz  and William Shatner. The first 2 episodes are about 2 1/2 hours each,and so is the last,the others are 47 minutes each. The final part of the concluding episode is so incredibly gripping but leaves you completely satisfied, this is a series that you will definitely want to watch more than once.

Exceptional storytelling, fresh innovative, intense, interweaving plotlines, incredible outdoor photography, excellent video and audio transfers, top quality guest stars, this is not just a frontier saga but could be considered as the finest western entertainment of all time.
