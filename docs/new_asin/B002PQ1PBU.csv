3965775,2,B002PQ1PBU,"I would love to have a BluRay quality DVD of Hawaii, as we went there earlier in the year, but I would not want a 4:3 picture (1.33:1).",1272412800,10,135,3.857142857142857
3965776,5,B002PQ1PBU,"This was a really beautifully shot piece.  The narration by F. Murray is pretty cool, and he doesn't dumb it down.  You really learn a lot in addition to getting to take in the cool scenery.  It looked ridiculously good-- almost photorealistic-- on my Blu-ray player and HD TV.  I totes recommend 100%.",1265241600,8,302,4.6415094339622645
3965777,2,B002PQ1PBU,"Was expecting beautiful scenery shots- fly overs, etc - instead was more scientific (which isn't bad - love nature shows) but found the subject matter lacking in depth.",1262649600,9,168,5.035714285714286

8377220,5,B002PQ1PBU,Good video. Nice scenes.,1505174400,,24,5.25

8377223,2,B002PQ1PBU,"Good cinematography as usual, but the subject matter was a let down compared to ""Africa."" I was expecting wildlife, and the entire movie is about volcanic eruptions. Granted, that makes sense considering it's Hawaii, but when you own both of the movies, you expect the content to be similar.  It's not really the same sort of movie, the vibe to make you watch this movie more than once just isn't there. The other, I play on a weekly basis to help relax and wind down because the music, and the story are peaceful.",1441411200,3,514,4.526881720430108

8377226,5,B002PQ1PBU,"The Blu-ray has 2 programs: 1)Kilauea:Mountain of Fire, which is entirely about the volcano, in detail;  2)Violent Hawaii, and is a more general review of the ""Big Island"", including of course Kilauea, but segments on weather, tsunamis, sea life (ie. humpback whales with pod of males in a violent rut-rumble), caves/lava-tubes, lava-flow damage to country-side roads and villages, etc. The DVD-copy of the disc can make a nice gift if a suitable separate case is added.  Contains some scenics, but for more overall pictorial views, I would recommend the Blu-ray ""Over Hawaii"", with all aerial views of incredibly-eroded landscapes, waterfalls & sea-cliffs, shot from slow choppers over most of the islands.",1418083200,8,707,5.36036036036036
8377227,3,B002PQ1PBU,I think if it had more Hawaii stuff I would give it a higher rating. Still all and all its cool.,1404086400,4,96,3.619047619047619
8377228,5,B002PQ1PBU,I have watched this several times and am always mesmerized. Our children stop what they are doing to view the nature and hear the educational narration. We can't wait to experience Hawaii ourselves!,1380153600,5,198,5.03030303030303
