8300024,3,B001EZ8IJA,"i found the first part of this fluffy comedy/drama detailing the stifling marriage to an overbearing husband trite - but it turned around big time almost half way thru when the wife (Sophie Marceau) made a bid for freedom and the writer started throwing in delightful twists and turns - it was as if the writer (Florence Quentin) consciously toyed with the win-love-back formula

Vincent Perez as the husband and Charles Berling as the new man in her life were excellent - Sophie was - well - Sophie - slightly mannered but good nonetheless - and  remarkably beautiful

directed by Diane Kurys its a nice film to look at - and not just at Sophie",1302998400,,645,4.591304347826087
