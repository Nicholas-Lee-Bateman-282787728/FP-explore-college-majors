1943526,5,B0000TG49C,"Keeping Up Appearances is a really funny look at the pretentiousness of a middle-aged British married couple. Between them, in episodic domestic episodes, they give a very funny portrait of the British middle class way of life of a few years ago. It's a send-up, of course. But, there are many gems of truth in each episode. The dialog and characters are real. I found it very funny. As a middle-aged expat, I found Hyacinth a true nostalgic trip back to a life once remembered. Try an episode. You won't be disappointed",1168041600,2,520,4.663043478260869

1943528,5,B0000TG49C,If you like Britcom's as I do then this is a must see. It's light hearted and quite funny. I tend to watch them over and over again and never get bored. One of the things I've noticed watching this and other Britcoms is how much we Americans and the Brits are so much alike. It's easy to relate to the situations.,1126483200,,313,4.064516129032258

1943530,5,B0000TG49C,"""Keeping Up Appearances"" was a 44-episode, British TV sitcom that ran for five seasons between 1990 and 1995, with several specials filmed through 1997. The show's primary character was Hyancinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge), who always pronounced her last name as 'Bouquet' to make it sound as impressive as possible. She was obsessed with making her family appear as affluent and upper class as possible, which involved keeping her home immaculately clean and bragging to everyone about any new acquisition. While Hyancinth believes that she is admired and well respected by her piers, the reality is that no one wants anything to do with her.  Her husband, Richard Bucket (Clive Swift), does not share Hyacinth's obsession, but he accommodates her as best as he can. Unfortunately for Hyacinth, her various plans to improve their station in life are often sidetracked by issues from her less affluent sisters or her senile father. The people that are most intimidated by Hyacinth are her next-door neighbor Elizabeth Hawksworth Warden (Josephine Tewson) and her brother Emmet Hawksworth (David Griffin, who appeared in the second season onward). The local church vicar, Michael (Jeremy Gittins), and his wife (played by Marion Barron) also try to avoid Hyacinth as much as possible.
Hyacinth's three sisters live to varying degrees of affluence. Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and her blue-collar husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes) live in a row house that is in dire need of repair, with a wrecked car parked out front and an unkempt interior. Hyancinth's unmarried sister Rose (played by Shirley Stelfox in 1990 and Mary Millar between 1991 and 1995) lives with Daisy and Onslow and enjoys spending time with many men to the chagrin of Hyancinth. Hyancinth's only affluent sister, Violet (Anna Dawson), is rarely seen, but Hyacinth often speaks with her on the telephone. However, Violet's husband Bruce (John Evitts), who is also rarely seen, often has a penchant for wearing women's clothes to Hyacinth's embarrassment. Their senile father (George Webb) lives with Daisy and Onslow, and has a tendency to run away and get himself into all sorts of trouble.
This 4-DVD set includes the following:
* Volume #5, entitled ""Everything's Coming Up Hyacinth"", includes all seven episodes from the third season.
* Volume #6, entitled ""Some Like it Hyacinth"", includes all seven episodes from the fourth season.
* Volume #7, entitled ""Living the Hyacinth Life"", includes the first six episodes of the fifth season and interviews with Patricia Rutledge and Clive Swift.
* Volume #8, entitled ""Hats Off to Hyacinth"", includes the last four episodes of the fifth season and the 1997 special ""The Memoirs of Hyancinth Bucket"".
Though ""Keeping Up Appearances"" is not as well known in the U.S. as ""Absolutely Fabulous"" (nor is it as outrageous), it is a very good example of British comedy. Overall, I rank this 4-DVD set with a rating of 5 out of 5 stars.",1082246400,54,2936,5.129436325678497

I have bought both sets namely Hyacinth in full bloom and Hyacinth springs eternal,  I cherished all the films with great amusement and laugh. I suggest this series to everybody who likes British comedy at its best.  However and may I be subject to correction,  Where is the episode THE ROLLS ROYCE which I assumed is in series five?  I don't know the answer why its lacking and I think its a great pity not having it in my set, perhaps someone could anser my question.

And let`s be honest we all know someone who is  similar to Hyacinth with a good guy husband like Richard, who is totally whipped, and she will have a neighbor like Elizabeth.  Family like Onslow, Daisey, Rose and Father.  Naturally Hyacinth would produce an offspring such as Sheridan.  Perfect script, perfect acting, simply perfect.",1378252800,,413,4.927536231884058

There were episodes I never saw until I started streaming the entire series.  I absolutely love Patricia Routledge as our Hyacinth, and poor Richard, and of course Onslo.  There is an excellent cast of supporting characters that will quickly become endearing to you.  If you enjoy good comedy, and are a fan of Britcoms, this is definitely a must see.

Patricia Routledge is superb as the aspiring elitist who contends with the problems inherent in dealing with lower class relatives, a daft father.

1943620,5,B0000TG49C,"I first ran into these by mistake -- when I regularly watched television. I did not really know what they were about. Nor had I ever seen ANY of the actors/actresses prior to then -- but BOY! Did I ever come to love this series!!!

Life is full of pretentious people but Mrs. Bucket (that's ""Bouquet"") is one of the wackiest. With her off the wall family, loving (but stressed out) husband, and kind next door neighbors --  her efforts to appear to be what she is not only end up causing her to become more isolated from the very people she wants most to impress (not her family, husband or immediate friends).

Despite that, hers is a character you come to care about as she lands herself in one mishap after another.

Similar to ""I Love Lucy"" (but not exactly as I am not convinced that anyone or anything could truly compare to it) this is an enduring comedy series which one can watch over and over again.

For new watchers and old ones - I highly recommend it!!! :)",1365379200,,970,4.337016574585635

Through her funny behavior she shows how ridiculous and futile that is.,1361836800,,245,4.674418604651163
1943639,5,B0000TG49C,"It's been quite a few years since I discovered this program on BBC, and I now own the complete collection on DVD. Patricia Routledge, quite simply, gives the most hilarious performance as the socially correct and pretentious Hyacinth Bucket (Bouquet in her parlance). No matter how much she knows about or attempts to practice with regard to etiquette, her motley assortment of dysfunctional family members offers up many opportunities to embarrass Hyacinth and she spends a great deal of time trying to avoid her sisters, the trampy Rose, unstylish and untidy Daisy, and lazy brother-in-law Onslow who live in a state of blissful disregard and indifference for their rundown and perpetually disheveled home and rattle trap car. Conversely, Hyacinth loves to tell everyone about her sister, Violet, who lives in a high end house and owns a ""sauna, Mercedes, and has room for a pony"" even though Violet and her husband Bruce are just as dysfunctional as the less well off members of the family. No one is safe from Hyacinth's annoying behavior and obliviousness to just how much she irritates everyone who knows her, especially her next door neighbors, the milkman, the postman, and the vicar. Hyacinth's husband, Richard, is the long suffering spouse that everyone feels sorry for. Filled with the unique British humor and Routledge's stellar performance, this series is bound to provide many laughs for those who watch. I highly recommend.",1361145600,2,1440,5.131914893617021
1943640,4,B0000TG49C,"Like most British comedy Keeping up Appearances is full of humor that is based on the interplay of the characters.  It's one drawback is the recurring themes.  Hyacinth is tremendously entertaining at first.  But over time, her lines became jaded. Even the reactions of the other cast got old.  It's still a funny show that merits watching.  I just wish the writers had been more creative instead of repeating the same gags.",1360800000,,424,4.833333333333333
1943641,5,B0000TG49C,My family and I LOVE this program! But it's awful how they didn't end the series properly. The Rolls Royce episode is cringe-worthy!,1360800000,,132,4.782608695652174

1943647,4,B0000TG49C,"I used to watch this on PBS with my mother back in the day. As I understand it, it's still running in select markets, and for good reason, it's highly entertaining! I used to love the time spent with my family as a kid whilst watching this show, sitting down and enjoying the cheeky comedy provided. It was a lot of fun in fact, and rewatching it brings back a flood of good memories. So obviously my opinion is colored because of that, but it really is a lot of fun to watch it! It's silly though, really silly. This is my absolute favorite season. Check it out, I dare you. In fact I triple dog dare you.",1324339200,2,606,4.1440677966101696

1943649,5,B0000TG49C,Keeping up Appearances for us is the very best of English comedy.  All the principle players are perfect and each has a great resume' in their background.  This is a show you can watch over and over and still enjoy with a lot of laughs.,1316649600,,236,4.222222222222222

1943665,5,B0000TG49C,"I absolutely love British comedy, and while I understand this is pretty much an ""old person's show"" in Great Britain, I think Hyacinth Bucket is fantastic (and I'm only 34).  Half of the entire series included in this multi-disc collection.  Brilliant cast, superb writing, and definitely rewatchable - again and again and again.  Great quality picture and sound which beats the quality you get from most public television stations.  A must have for the Britcom buff.",1213920000,2,467,5.105263157894737

1943670,5,B0000TG49C,"Though not really rabid, Emmet and the rest of the cast will do nearly anything to avoid Hyacinth, the ""Bucket Woman."" Patricia Routledge is perfect in this series as Hyacinth Bucket (""it's pronounced 'Bouquet'""...) as a social climber who will do anything to be noticed by the upper class. Well known for her candlelight suppers, Hyacinth ventures into more novel entertaining venues in these episodes. One of my favorites of this set is ""Riparian Entertainments,"" which has a deliciously wicked nautical twist. Interestingly several of the other episodes in this set also have a nautical back story.

In these episodes Elizabeth and Emmet develop into central roles; Elizabeth gets ever more nervous around Hyacinth and develops an unusual drinking problem, while Emmet goes to any lengths to hide from Hyacinth (""She'll sing at me!"") The rest of the cast is perfect as well: Rose is sworn off men (...again...sadly Mary Millar recently passed away,) Daisy and Onslow manage to offend Hyacinth with their lower class sensibilities and ""bone-idleness,"" while simultaneously being the most likeable members of the cast. I especially enjoy seeing Onslow in his sweater vest or Green Bay Packers t-shirt reading ""Principles of Condensed Matter Physics."" The supporting cast members are fabulous as well: the postman and milkman are wonderful in their attempts to avoid Hyacinth, and the Vicar and his wife are delightfully resourceful in keeping Hyacinth at arm's length as well.

These DVD's are the last half of the series and largely cover the leisure years after poor Richard (played to perfection by Clive Swift) retires. I don't envy his retirement one bit no matter how many golf outings, dress balls, or estate sales he gets to attend...but I do especially like the outing where Hyacinth and Richard go horseback riding with Emmet, an expert rider.

This is a great series and a great boxed set. There are several extras ranging from public service announcements to outtakes, all of which are worth watching. Most of all, though, sit back and revel in the good humor and hilarity ranging from the incredibly subtle to the sublimely ridiculous. I highly recommend this set to anyone with a sense of humor. It's one series you can watch repeatedly and never get tired of.",1177545600,3,2275,5.077540106951871
