4240272,5,B004083REE,"After a melancholy Season Three chronicling Rhoda's separation and eventual divorce from Joe, the show bounces back in its fourth season, originally airing Sunday nights at 8pm on CBS during the 1977-78 TV season with a total of 24 episodes.

First, the bad: The script quality was declining at this point, but the cast gamely did their best with what they were given.

 The good news is that Nancy Walker returns after a one-year absence (and two failed sitcom attempts at rival network ABC: ""The Nancy Walker Show""; ""Blansky's Beauties""). Her scenes with Harper and Kavner are always high points of the show. Kavner even won an Emmy for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work this season, beating out Sally Struthers.

With Joe out of the picture for good, the series can now focus on Rhoda and Brenda as two swinging singles in the Big Apple during the disco era. Even the opening credits reflect this, with location scenes of ""Rho and Bren"" throughout NYC backed by the absolute best version of the catchy theme song to date. (This version will get stuck in your head for days, with its powerhouse drumming and lovely bells and chimes).

Valerie Harper looks somewhat emaciated when the season begins, and Julie Kavner has grown her hair long, though she goes back to her medium-length hairstyle by mid-season.

Rhoda begins her new job working at a costume shop for gruff boss Jack Doyle. Friend and neighbour Gary (Ron Silver) is still in the picture, and Brenda is dating the rollerskating toll-booth operator Benny. Rhoda occasionally dates the flashy nightclub singer Johnny Venture. Verna, the crazy cat lady appears for a few episodes.

While many viewers have stated the show had clearly Jumped the Shark at this point, I suggest giving it a second chance because it actually plays better now compared to most of the subpar sitcoms of the late-1990s-today currently in syndication.

Some of the more memorable episodes this season include the opener where Ida returns from a one-year travelling vacation; ""Who's Shy"" in which Brenda joins a help group to become more assertive (watch for her dead-on Ida impression); ""So Long, Lucky"" (with ""Phyllis"" star Carmine Caridi) where Rhoda seems to have ""cursed"" a NYC cop; and ""Five For the Road"", which has the gang stranded during a road trip.

Shout! Factory has really done right by the fans by continuing to release ""Rhoda"" on DVD. After the Season One debacle with cut and faded prints, they have redeemed themselves because the episodes on subsequent releases look better than ever! The cover art has been gorgeous and the menus very well-done.

The design and layout of Season 4 seems a little cheaper than previous releases, but this is still a quality product we should be very grateful for. This volume uses the same graphics and layout as previous releases. However, like other Shout! Select titles, they have forgone the outer box/slim cases format and this set comes in a plastic snapcase. Also, the original episode airdates are not listed this time around.

The menus are more static and the closing theme loops as we see an episode selection and the same image of Rhoda that appears on the cover.

As with Seasons 2 and 3, the picture has been remastered and has never looked this good before. I can finally toss my old VHS tapes from WTN and Nick@Nite!

Fans need to support this Shout! select title so that they will soon bring us the fifth and final season on DVD. You can order it direct from the Shout Factory website. Once there, you will find S4 of ""Rhoda"" under the Shout Select tab, which features all their online exclusives. Here's hoping after that they will bring us a complete series set of ""Phyllis""!",1284768000,66,3705,4.806603773584905
4240273,5,B004083REE,I adore Valerie Harper and I just eat up Rhoda and her crazy family and friends. Such an enjoyable bit of 70s nostalgia. I didn't know if I would like this show when I bought it but I am crazy about it. I highly recommend this series as well as the Mary Tyler Moore Show AND The Dick Van Dyke Show.,1441756800,5,298,3.901639344262295

4240281,5,B004083REE,"Rhoda is such a good show. I was born on the late 60s so only discovered Mary Tyler Moore and Rhoda as re-runs. Both shows are exceptional. I just finished watching Season 4 of Rhoda and I loved every episode of it!!! Rhoda and Brenda are amazing, and Ida, oh my goodness, she could be my mother's twin!!
What a wholesome awesome show. Too bad they don't make shows like this anymore!!",1393200000,2,385,4.361111111111111
4240282,3,B004083REE,"Better than Season 3 but not up to their potential.  Watching Valerie is no problem.  Poor scripts don't entertain.
First two seasons were better.",1387152000,2,146,5.041666666666667
4240283,5,B004083REE,"Wonderful sit-com series that ended too soon, in spite of the absence of Joe. Johnny Venture (Michael DeLano) was great in his over-the-top characterization of the lounge entertainer.",1384732800,,183,5.571428571428571
4240284,5,B004083REE,Outstanding!  So enjoyable and entertaining.  Such an incredibly talented cast.  Valerie Harper is an amazing talent and developed her character brilliantly.  Today's sitcoms pale in comparison.,1383264000,,194,6.346153846153846

4240287,3,B004083REE,"First, the only problem I saw on the dvd was the last episode's abrupt ending. It just ends? Second, I have never seen a series where each year gets worse. Series usually get stronger as they reach 3rd season or so. Not in Rhoda's case. Season 1 was the best (even though the dvd was edited.) But as a series it was the best. Season 2 wasn't as good. Season 3 was even worse. Get my drift? Each season got worse. I have even seen part of season 5. I can see why it was cancelled. It was almost unbearable! What a shame...",1379289600,,521,4.067961165048544

S T O P REQUIRING S O MANY WORDS",1365465600,,98,3.5
4240294,5,B004083REE,"Season 4 begins with Rhoda's divorced being final. Joe's name is never uttered. As Rhoda vents her frustration about her divorce decree, Ida knocks on her door. Ida is back!! Thank God! Harold Gould, too, returns to make a few appearances as her father, Martin. Also this season, Rhoda abandons her ""Windows by Rhoda,"" business and gets hired by a costumer, Jack Doyle. Brenda dates both Gary and Benny.

Guest stars this season include Judd Hirsch, whom I had read had been considered for the role of Joe Gerard. The chemistry was certainly there with he and Valerie, and the contentious sparks between he and Ida are great. If the producers had cast Judd as Joe, I strongly suspect that they would have been able to successfully write Rhoda as a married woman.

A particular favorite episode of mine is the one with home movies. At a boring family dinner, they end up watching home movies. Of course, the audience has to accept the alleged fact that Ida and Martin had had a home movie camera in 1942 when Rhoda was baby. The episode is hysterical as the home movies capture styles of the time periods that the movies were taken and as the characters make their current day comments on what they are watching.

Rhoda as a single gal in NYC works.",1357171200,,1248,4.5874439461883405
4240295,5,B004083REE,I'm Glad shout decided to give Rhoda another chance and release season 4 even if you can only order it offline. It was nice to see Ida and Martin again because Ida is always on point were her comedic wit.,1350777600,,204,4.125
4240296,5,B004083REE,"I always loved the Rhoda show. I waited so long for it to come out on DVD. It was well worth the wait. It brings back so many memories. This season is the best of all 4 seasons. It is really the most funny. Hey, ya gotta love the seventies.",1337817600,,240,3.82
4240297,5,B004083REE,"I've been so thrilled with the release of the Rhoda episodes. I love this series, but what about season 5?. Will shout release the last season so we can complete the collection. I have the last season on VHS but would be great to have all on DVD. Lets go Shout whats taking so long.",1318723200,,282,4.1454545454545455
4240298,3,B004083REE,"Finally, we get to see Rhoda as an independent woman again.  Back on the dating circuit, hanging with friends, and funny as ever!  Season 4 was a great year for the show.  I actually like the episodes that have Rhoda single as opposed to the ""Joe"" years.  One of my favorite seasons of the series.

The quality of these episodes is, OK.  A little grainy (Shout Factory is claiming they have been resotred...?)

A pet peeve of mine would have to be the incosistancy of the opening credits.  The early part of season 4 had a very emaciated Valerie Harper in the opening.  I don't know if it was Valerie herself, or the producers, but the credits were re-edited after the first several episodes to show a healthier ""Rhoda"" in the first part as the theme song plays.  Whoever did the editing (and there was unfortunately some editing) was very inconsistant in attaching the theme song and credit sequence to the episodes having the opening variations switch back and forth.  Another example, in the premiere episode of season four (The Return of Ida), the theme song had a different arrangement then was heard in the rest of the season.  The drums that accompmied the funky bassline were completely different, and the whole song had a different mix.  It is very rare, and I was hoping to finally get a hold of it.  Shout Factory didn't use it in the episode, but instead just used the standard version. Also, no extras on this. It is a shame that such a great show got just an OK treatment this time around.

Still worth getting, it's a great under-rated show.",1297728000,2,1556,4.566787003610108
4240299,5,B004083REE,"Could it be that Amazon won't be selling season 4 directly? It's presently (as of 11/3/10) available for purchase directly from the ""Shout! Factory"" website.

4240300,3,B004083REE,"I love this show, and give it 5 stars, for the show itself.  However, I don't know if this was a mastering problem, but the video in this release is choppy.  It seems like they've upsampled the frame rate or something, but it's not smooth at all.

I haven't gotten though the first disc yet because of this.  the problem is particularly evident in the 4th season opener, when Rhoda throws the newspapers up in the air, and also the bit with the beads. It's also very evident in panning shots, which should pan smoothly from one side to the other, but this is very choppy as well.

The problem does not exist in the previews included on Disc 1 as they play smoothly.  It's only in the episodes I see the choppiness.  Thinking maybe it was just the first episode, I sampled various episodes on all discs, and the problem is persistent throughout the set.

I've tried the discs in my home DVD player, as well as my PC - which can play 3D 1080P Blu Ray just fine.
