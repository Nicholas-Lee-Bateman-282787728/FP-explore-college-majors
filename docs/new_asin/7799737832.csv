8273497,3,7799737832,"Only a few discs actually work on a region free stand-alone DVD player. Luckily the other discs work on a region free laptop DVD player, but then I have to hook the laptop to the TV and also deal with screen size settings on the laptop. Also the ""language settings"" menu on all DVD's look are not the same, suggesting that each disc is produced not by a unified manner.",1484524800,,369,4.285714285714286
8273498,2,7799737832,We have purchased several Mandarin dubbed DVDs from Amazon for our son who is studying the language. We purchased a Philips region free DVD player especially for this purpose and it has worked for all of the non-US DVDs.  Our son begged us for this Harry Potter collection.  Disks 1 and 2 worked perfectly.  Disks 3 - 7 did no play on the Philips.  We can make these play on my Linux with an app that allows it to work.  But we didn't buy this to be limited to viewing on my computer. Disappointed,1456617600,,497,4.24468085106383
8273499,4,7799737832,"Of note, this is not a region free version, so you need to have a region free DVD or blu ray player to play these movies.  Great quality, and the dubbing in Chinese is very good.  The sound quality and video quality all seem good.  I have a lot of Chinese dubbed movies, and they did a good job with the Chinese dubbing, making it sound good with pretty good voice actors.  Not as good as in English, but pretty good for dubbing.  Overall great product.

I would've given this 5 stars, but the shipping took forever.  So be aware that it's shipping from Asian and will take a really long time.  The package got stuck in customs, so it extended by shipping by another 2 weeks for a total of 6 weeks before receiving the package.  So great product but anticipate long shipping wait.",1420156800,,780,4.324137931034483

8273501,4,7799737832,"I received the HP 8-DVD collection (Mandarin Chinese Edition) for Christmas; and I have watched all of them - some twice.  I wanted this set, because I'm learning Mandarin; so I was looking for ""American"" movies that I already know the theme (and a good portion of the dialog).

Pros:
- The Mandarin set is fairly inexpensive, compared to the English equivalent set.
- The translations are fairly decent (good sound quality, follow the character's persona, etc).  Yes, Hermione's voice is as annoying in Mandarin as it is in English.
- The menus on the later disks are in English and Chinese (Hanyu).
- The disks and box/packaging are very good quality.  While this is not anything spectacular; the box is certainly a solid case which will protect all of the disks.  If you are thinking of giving this as a gift; it looks fairly nice.
- This is the only set I have received from Fast Shipper 4U; but, as I learned from the person that bought the set for me, they shipped it quickly and it arrived as expected.

Cons:
- The disks will not play on many American DVD players - the benefit of market economics.  However, I did get all of my region 6 disks to play on my Mac Mini without making any modifications; so it's not impossible to find a player.  Also, I have found several computer DVD/BluRay drives (esp Asus and Pioneer) that can play disks intended for non-US markets.  But, buyers should be aware that the Sony PS3, like most major name-brand DVD players, will NOT play these disks.  Some devices can be ""programmed"" (ie hacked); but this is not an option for technologically challenged.
- The main menus on the disks can be difficult to maneuver for people that can not, yet, read Chinese.  Luckily, there are not too many options; so I was able to figure out the options I was unable to read through trial-and-error.  On the last 2 disks, though, (as I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section) they do provide English along with the Hanyu.

Overall, this is one of the best gifts I have received; and I will watch it again and again.  As anyone that has learned another language will attest, watching movies is one of the best ways to ""acclimate"" yourself.",1360800000,,2159,4.5595854922279795
8273502,5,7799737832,What more to say than perfect quality and audio. Purchased for my brother in law who is learning Mandarin in the Navy and he was very pleased. Couldn't have asked for more.,1359158400,,172,4.40625
