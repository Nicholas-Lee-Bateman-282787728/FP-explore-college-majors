8442329,4,B004UVYQ7S,"I was hesitant to pick this up based on the scarcity of information on the quality of the transfer, but the DVD-r quality is decent enough. Presented in standard flat widescreen aspect ratio.",1484611200,,191,4.818181818181818
8442330,3,B004UVYQ7S,"With all the ""reviews"" here, you'd think somebody would have been able to provide some useful information - but, sadly, that is not the case.  What about the aspect ratio, the quality of the transfer, and the sound?  Are there subtitles?  Can anyone provide such details?  To write, ""excellent product, great shipping"" and think that's a review is just stupid.",1473379200,4,360,4.95

8442332,2,B004UVYQ7S,"The idea was to show you Billy the Kid prior to him becoming a dangerous killer in a dirty and dusty little western town.  Michael J. Pollard did a pretty decent job as Billy, but Lee Purcell turned in the best performance as Berle the local prostitute and girlfriend of Goldie (Richard Evans) the local killer and owner of the saloon.  Gary Busey had a small role and it marked the first, but brief, appearances of Ed Lauter and Nick Nolte. Most of the film takes place inside the small saloon.  If you missed this and you are a western or Billy The Kid fan you might want to give it a look see for something to pass the time and are curious about it.",1429574400,2,652,4.2

8442334,5,B004UVYQ7S,"Michael J Pollard gives an excellent rendition of what Billy may have have been like. Instead of the cocky, handsome Young Guns Kid, Mr. Pollard portrays a young, bright-eyed, yet ordinary looking teen ager out in the Wild West. Keen, quiet, and knowing, Pollard's Billy sides with another young ""anti-establishment"" fellow who happens to own a saloon. The bulk of the story centers on the goings on in that saloon, with Billy, the young saloon owner, and his beautiful lady companion. The entire film is of course slow paced Seventies style, but the flic isn't long to watch. It is definitely a must watch for any Kid admirers. By the way, Lee Purcell looks *amazing* in this film.",1422057600,3,682,4.788135593220339
8442335,4,B004UVYQ7S,This movie was as good as when I initially watched it.  Quite a different take on the legend of Billy the Kid.  A must for any devotee of Western movies.,1401753600,,153,4.066666666666666
8442336,2,B004UVYQ7S,"Although I don't disagree with the above comments - that this is a non-glamorized depiction of the character and that it is a realistic depiction of the rough old west - I would not recommend this movie.  (By the way it does not star Gary Busey. In fact, he is barely in it at all, so it's misleading that the packaging says he is a principle...)  The directing was very strong.  The photography was very strong.  The acting was very strong.  The problem lies in the poor screen play.  If, as it purports, it is not a story about his bad glory days, but about how he got his start, then one would think we learn some things about the character that made him the cunning, ruthless, independent, rebellious renegade that he was.  If fact, we don't.  We learn only that he had a mother who  cared for him and a step-father who hated him and wanted him out.  And the mayor of his home town seemed to care about him, at least a little.  Beyond that we learn nothing significant about what shaped him.  Not only that, we learn nothing significant about his thoughts or feelings during these formative years.  The only exception is that we learn he has some tenderness for his friend's girlfriend; and that hardly makes him unique or even unusual.  Ultimately, I didn't know this figure any better after the movie than before.  Moreover, I didn't care a lick about him or any of the other characters.  If that's not enough to repel you, how about some unnecessarily graphic depictions of brutal violence.  Too bad this fine director did not find a  screenwriter more his equal.",1383782400,3,1570,4.526690391459074
8442337,3,B004UVYQ7S,"I was Location Manager for this movie. I think it was Stan Dragotti's first directing job for a feature film. I think he had only shot commercials prior to this. However; aside from being dreary and a little depressing, this was a fun movie, shot at Old Tucson's Mescal Western set. We had lots of water trucks keeping it muddy. It is a good western and unfortunately, they are dying out. I recommend this movie.",1349136000,10,412,4.506666666666667
8442338,4,B004UVYQ7S,"I saw this movie once when it came out and have been looking for it again ever since. Amazon came through for me.  The movie is as good as I remembered, and a pleasure to watch if you are into western realism. It covers the very early days of Billy, just after the mother and step-father moved from New York.  It,therefore, covers a little examined and very formative period in Billy's life.  Dirty, ugly, gritty, too real for many, but an accurate depiction of what a tiny frontier town was like.  A must for Western scholars to see, and a ""James Dean"" role for Michael J. Pollard. ""Dirty Little Billy"" is a sleeper that was about 40 years too early to be appreciated. It should be classed with ""The Proposition"".",1343174400,9,714,4.469230769230769
