8623649,5,B00GIWRE58,"This story is based on a Comic.. Kim Soo Hyun is a North Korea spy who is sent to the south to spy. After  two years living with a kindly shop owner and her son things heat up. He is well trained (spoilers  alert) but as his cover he pretends to be mentally  slow and clumsy. Then  two of his fellow spies come the the same small section awaiting their orders. This is a bittersweet tragic story about friendship family, and choices. It  you like thought provoking  movies that will make you cry this is it. Kim Soo hyun is excellent  and the other stars as well do an exceptional  job in this movie.",1441411200,,600,4.201754385964913
