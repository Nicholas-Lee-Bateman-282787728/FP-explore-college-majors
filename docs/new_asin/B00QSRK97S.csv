8692713,5,B00QSRK97S,"Got to see this for the premiere and I really enjoyed it. It's a powerful film that really grabs you from the beginning and really pushes your imagination to the limits. The director, Brandon, really brought a great vision to the big screen, and he really does a great job in capturing a unique and engrossing story. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a touch of Sci-Fi with a big thrill ride of a film all the way till the end.",1438387200,,442,4.273809523809524
