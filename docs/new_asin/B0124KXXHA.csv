7342636,5,B0124KXXHA,"I just love the Danny kaye show and I would really love for you to make more episodes, and perhaps all of Danny Kayes shows on DVD! I will buy them all! I remember vividly seeing them on tv in the sixties and my favorite comedians then was Danny Kaye and Jerry Lewis. They don't make shows like this any more, thats for sure. I also loved to see the stars again when they werw so young, I really have a good time watching these episodes over and over again.",1457308800,,457,4.088888888888889

7342638,5,B0124KXXHA,It was great to revisit the charm and charismatic appeal of Danny Kaye. He was an entertainer of the highest calibre. Thoroughly enjoyed his supporting acts in each segment.,1447804800,2,173,5.0

7342640,3,B0124KXXHA,"Danny Kaye was an extraordinary performer. The toast of Broadway from ""Lady in the Dark"" in the early '40s through ""Two by Two"" in the early '70s, he was a smash. He was boffo in movies, from ""Up in Arms"" (1944) through ""The Madwoman of Chaillot"" (1969) with Katherine Hepburn, all home run hits, no walks, no errors.  And on television, four great seasons of variety entertainment, plus Captain Hook to Mia Farrow's ""Peter Pan"" in 1976 and the breathtaking, heartbreaking Max Feldman in 1981's ""Skokie"" only added to the luster of his talent.

There's been a sort of renaissance of Kaye with the  new availability of almost all of his films and out of sequence ""best of"" from the variety ""The Danny Kaye Show.""  Well, MVD has released six complete episodes of the show (that ran 1963-1967k), with Kaye welcoming some of the greatest icons of American entertainment. Included are Louis Armstrong, Lucille Ball, Tony Bennett, George Burns, Imogene Coca, Shirley Jones, Liberace and an uncredited mouse sneaking around upstage right of Lucy Ball in a sketch. That a mouse should be noticed suggests the level of excitement here.

Possibly it's a matter of aging: Comedy does not travel well from decade to decade. Also, Kaye himself is something of an anomaly.  Even given the noxious rumors about his sex life, he is a strangely asexual performer.  Someone from the period as laid back as Perry Como does have a modicum of sexual attractiveness. Kaye is warm and loving and pleasing, but somehow lacking.  Something just doesn't ring true. God knows Kaye is energetic, active, bouncy even, perhaps at times, exhausting in his rampant desire to please. Not since Sammy Davis Jr. has there been a performer who should haven take a Valium or offer them to his audience.  Like Davis Jr., Kaye dances, sings, acts, does imitations, comic monologues and just about anything else in the field of entertainment at a breakneck speed, thrown helter skelter at his audience with the guest stars dragged along just for the fun of it.

Such is the lack of subtlety here that the mouse should be noticed.  There are tons of entertainment superstars here that seem wasted.  The anticipation and excitement of this time capsule of entertainment is strangely muted in the consumption.  No one is as good as expected, or hoped for.  As a piece of entertainment history, these shows are invaluable.  They're just not very entertaining.",1446249600,5,2415,4.899262899262899
7342641,5,B0124KXXHA,"Okay, this is wonderful, and I've only seen parts of the first of two disks because they were badly scratched in transit and I'm waiting for my replacement.  The guest on the second show of disk one is Imogene Coca.  They did some sketches that were hilarious -- one where mistakes kept happening in front of the live audience and Kaye made the most of it turning it into something even funnier, and one crazy ballet sketch where, towards the end, he showed off some real ballet skill.  It was surreal to see these two comics together since this was filmed in 1964, and they made a short film together in 1937 called ""Dime a Dance."" (YouTube, Library of Congress).

I can hardly wait to get my replacement of these shows so I can actually watch both full disks.  I really, REALLY wish they would put the entire show (all seasons) together in one set.  I for one would buy it in a heartbeat.  Maybe if enough people make the same comment, they will realize that Danny Kaye still has loads of fans out there.",1445040000,15,1006,4.405405405405405
8725347,5,B0124KXXHA,"Danny Kaye was an amazingly talented man, but hard to classify. He could dance, sing just about any sort of music, do various characters in various ethnic accents, sing tongue twisting songs, mimic other famous people, clown around and do manic comedy; I can't even list all the things he could do. His movies were good, some even great, but he shone in front of a live audience. Unfortunately, those live shows were not recorded for the most part. But he found a new media where he could connect with an audience, and that was live TV.

This 2 cd set has 6 full length ""The Danny Kaye Show"" segments as seen on TV in the 1960s. (Half are in b/w; half colour.) I grew up watching him on Wednesday nights at 9:00. It was a variety show with music, dancing, famous guest stars and my favourite, the skits and sketches. These dvd's took me back and I appreciate the shows even more than I did then. I hope at some time they will bring out the whole set of shows from those several years in the mid 60s. Not everything holds up well after that much time, but a lot of it does. This was a wonderful trip through memory lane for me.",1531612800,,1126,4.261682242990654

8725349,5,B0124KXXHA,"I really like watching these episodes of the Danny Kaye Show.  I wish they would release the episode with John and Hayley Mills when they were guests.  Our children today will never see the quality of television in shows like this and other variety shows that were on during that time.  I hope in the future, they release more episodes or the entire four seasons.  I will definitely buy them all.  I hope in the next set, if they release more, will be John and Hayley!",1493596800,,468,4.395348837209302
