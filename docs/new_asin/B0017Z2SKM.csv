8267836,5,B0017Z2SKM,"""Grand Canyon  - Portrait of Water & Stone"" is a nice followup to the previous Grand Canyon DVD put out by the ""Sierra Nomad,"" namely ""DVD Hiking Guide - Grand Canyon National Park"". Or, if you have no intention of getting your boots scuffed by hiking down below the rim, and so aren't interested in the hiking tips in the first DVD (although you still might very well want that one, too, so that you can vicariously experience the hikes--the ""sweet without the sweat""), this ""sampler"" makes an excellent alternative.

If you can't make it to the Grand Canyon at all, this is the second best thing to actually being there. If you are planning a trip there, this will whet your appetite; if you've already been, it makes a nice souvenir that will doubtless recall to your mind what you saw there.

To get down to the nitty gritty: the scenes are sublime, showing the Canyon in its glory below the rim, and all along the rim. The ""Sierra Nomad"" captures the vivid and vibrant hues of this jewel of the American West with his stunning photography. Besides the Canyon itself and its primitive formations, the flora and fauna of the Canyon are also exposed to our view (birds, insects, elk, mountain goats, etc.).

Accompanying the visuals are sounds of some of the wildlife depicted, as well as atmospheric music that meshes very nicely with the scenes.

This DVD is ""wild"" in the best and truest sense of the word. Watching it is simultaneously soothing and exhilirating, like a cup of fresh-brewed coffee on a crisp morning. Stressed out? This DVD may be the antidote.",1208390400,,1566,4.659420289855072
