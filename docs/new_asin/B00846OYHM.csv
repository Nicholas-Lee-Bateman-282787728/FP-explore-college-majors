5130232,5,B00846OYHM,"I hated Tiny Toons series; however, this movie was hilarious!! It still sticks with me when I am on the road traveling ""There's a car, there's a car..."" I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants 90 minutes of pure, old school entertainment. Young or old this movie was phenomenal!",1339718400,,288,4.666666666666667
5130233,5,B00846OYHM,"So I got rid of every single one of my VHS's....EXCEPT THIS ONE.  This movie was one of my favorites from childhood and was worth keeping a WHS player just for this 1 movie!  I recently watched it with my 86 year old grandmother and I think she enjoyed it even more than I did!!!  It is fun for all ages and especially enjoy if you lived through the 90's and understand all the pop culture reference but children today can enjoy it as well!!

Now if we could just get seasons 2 and 3 released as well!!!!",1339545600,,504,4.112244897959184
5130234,4,B00846OYHM,"This was one of the best direct-to-video releases I can remember...however, that was 21 years ago. Lots of the jokes (Roseanne Barr singing the national anthem comes to mind) aren't going to register with new, younger viewers. Most of the movie should hold up well enough, though, that's it's worth purchasing. The DVD cover, however, is rather unfortunate. It's not an accurate portrayal of anything that happens in the film plus it would make the movie appear more juvenile than it actually is (there are several instances of more adult humor in this movie, although they should sail right over most younger kids' heads). But it's a very funny movie with very good animation made when a very good early 1990s animated franchise was doing some of its best work.",1339372800,23,762,4.869230769230769
5130235,5,B00846OYHM,"Just pre-ordered!  So excited!

5130240,5,B00846OYHM,"One of the best animated films out there that is also one of the best ensemble films you will ever be lucky enough to view.  The DVD doesn't have much in terms of special features, but the animation still looks fantastic, and the jokes are still just as funny as there were over 20 years ago.",1498435200,,292,4.214285714285714
5130241,5,B00846OYHM,"Low Quality as VHS used to be. However rather enjoyable. I'm happy I purchased it in DVD format. Felt like this was a n edited version from what I remember as a kid (like with the 99 bottles of non-alcoholic beverages song). I could swear they said beer in the one I saw as a kid. If I ever successfully get my VHS version out of the VHS without tearing the tape, I will compare.",1492819200,,379,4.066666666666666

5130247,5,B00846OYHM,"I bought this for my child & it brought back so many good childhood memories. The movie is clean, the songs are catchy and funny. There is some adult humor in this that I caught into now. It totally goes over the child's head.",1477180800,,226,4.159090909090909

5130253,5,B00846OYHM,grandkids loved the movie as much as I did when I watched with my kids in the 90's,1468281600,,82,3.611111111111111
5130254,5,B00846OYHM,"I was so thrilled to find this relic of my childhood available on DVD.  I remember I used to watch this 2-3 times a day almost everyday, when I was a kid.  Through the years, I have remembered so much of it, and yet when I watched it again recently, I saw many things I had forgotten about (such as, ""Sixty-seven bottles of non-alcoholic beverage on the wall, sixty-seven bottles of non-alcoholic beverage..."")  Oh, good times, good times.

I have noticed that some have complained about the image quality of this, but I had no issues with it. It looks (and sounds) exactly the same as my VHS copy.  Kids today would probably like it--they may not get all the jokes or references to early '90s popular figures, but there is still a lot to enjoy.  This was one of my favorite videos while growing up, and it has been nice taking this trip back in time.",1468022400,3,851,4.388535031847134
5130255,5,B00846OYHM,It's perfect. Just what I remember watching when I was a kid. And that makes all the better while I share it with my kids since I get a little tired of cartoons now days. Things like this are a life saver since watching some of the shows that my kids watch make me want to beat my head. Also I've noticed that since they've watched this they seem to have more of interest in the world since they want to understand the old references. It's really rather neat.,1466553600,,459,4.168539325842697
5130256,5,B00846OYHM,So happy I found this movie again. I used to watch this all the time as a child. I was supposed how many lines I remembered.,1464220800,,124,3.8076923076923075

5130259,5,B00846OYHM,"Just received my copy of Tiny Toons How I Spent My Summer Vacation.  Very very pleased with it.  I have read several reviews online about this product and the one common complain I continued to read was regarding the quality of the film.  This film is NOT claiming to be remastered. So, no, it is not blu ray quality, but that was not what I was expecting.  It is dvd quality and I have been watching it on a 65"" LG TV with a PS4 and I have no complaints.  While reading some of the reviews I questioned wether or not I should have ordered it, and boy am I glad that I did!! My kids are LOVING it and so are my husband and I.  Brings you back to the early 90s.  If you love this cartoon as much as I do then by all means do not let the reviews of quality stop you from purchasing.  I will repurchase this when I do see that it has been digitally remastered if that ever happens (fingers crossed) but until then, we are working on wearing our copy out!",1462406400,3,951,3.994708994708995

5130263,5,B00846OYHM,Glad this was finally put on DVD. I grew up with in on VHS and wanted to share it with my kids.,1454284800,,95,3.3636363636363638
5130264,5,B00846OYHM,"First off, I'd like to make it known that the dvd came out perfectly clear on my devices. I had read some reviews where some had trouble playing it or the picture wasn't that great. The only thing I can think of why the picture wouldn't be clear on any device would might have to deal with the type of tv or player you have. I have Vizio brand for both.

Any kid who grew up in the 90's surely remember Tiny Toons Adventures.

Buster and Babs floating down river their whole summer.

(Highlights: Buster and Babs water fights and the possum kid. Plucky Duck wanting nothing more than to see Happy World Land. Of course, that wasn't without a few major obstacles for Plucky on the way. Elmyra desperately wanting a kitty. It's her obsession didn't you know?)",1453075200,,757,4.431654676258993

After watching it as an adult, I can guarantee they would never make a cartoon like this in this day and age. Too bad because it's hilarious! Love this movie.",1447545600,,286,3.9482758620689653

5130306,5,B00846OYHM,"This first feature-length film of the popular cartoon ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" should've warranted some time on the big screen. The film, subtitled ""How I Spent My Vacation,"" chronicles several of the characters adventures during summer vacation, all with hilarious and unforgettable results. Buster and Babs Bunny find themselves inadvertently sailing down the river where they encounter a bunch of redneck alligators and a country bumpkin opossum. Plucky Duck thinks he's in for a treat when he's invited to go to a major theme park with Hampton Pig and his family but it turns out to be a cross-country trip from Hell as Hampton and his family become the most insufferable people imaginable. They make Chevy Chase's cross-country trip in ""Vacation"" feel like a stroll through a rose garden. Other characters get involved in hijinks too throughout, each with their own hilarious results. The film doesn't lack the punch, sarcasm and pop culture quips that the show offered, which makes it all the more enjoyable.",1398038400,,1012,5.176829268292683
5130307,3,B00846OYHM,So my wife was estatic that this movie from her childhood could be purchased on dvd. The fact that its even available is why it gets even 3 stars because the transfer must have been just horrible. Our VHS copy looks about as clear as the picture does on the dvd.,1396915200,,262,4.1568627450980395
5130308,3,B00846OYHM,IT'S SEEM PRETTY OKAY. THIS IS THE LAST ONE OF TINY TOONS BY STEVEN SPEILBERG. ONE OF MY FAVORITE IS ANIMANIACS' WAKO'S WISH. NOW THAT'S IS THE BEST ONE.,1396224000,,153,4.310344827586207
5130309,3,B00846OYHM,"Originally my young son wanted to rent this movie and I wanted some movie that wasn't a cartoon movie. This movie has more laughs than any movie  I can think of.  A lot of the the humor is over a young child,s head but is funny on their level as well like a lot of Disney cartoons.  We've been checking every year for a DVD to come out and was trilled to find.  The three of us (son 29) sat down aand laughed our hesds off!!  Buy it -- you'll enjoy it , especially bon s tough day.",1394496000,,481,3.86734693877551

5130314,5,B00846OYHM,"I remember watching this as a kid thinking it was the best. I am 24 now and when I watched it after it was delivered, I was transported back to my childhood. I love this movie! And of course a little herb helps you enjoy it even more ;)",1392249600,,236,3.836734693877551
5130315,5,B00846OYHM,This was a favorite of my siblings and myself growing up. To this day we still quote it like crazy. It is one of those cartoons that is enjoyable for adults too. Funny.,1391558400,,168,4.121212121212121
5130316,5,B00846OYHM,"i adore this movie, My kids and I spent hot summer afternoons watching this and loved it. it's a little outdated at this point but it's still so fun, as with all Steven Spielberg adventures! This movie is hilarious and has so much  subliminal adult comedy!",1390867200,,256,4.565217391304348
5130317,5,B00846OYHM,"I used to watch this movie every week as a kid. Growing up, I absolutely adored watching Buster and Babs float along some vaguely Mississippi-esque river and watching Plucky face everything under the sun for a chance to go to Happy World Land. My VHS copy long-since wore out and I don't have a VHS player anyway. I was always disappointed to see that this classic hadn't made the jump to DVD or digital yet.

And then, it did. And oh, was it glorious. Yeah, it still looks like a 90s cartoon. No, there aren't any special features. But you get to watch Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation. You get to hold your breath through the tunnel and dream about large-scale water gun fights. I'm holding on to this DVD so that I can hopefully watch it with my kids one day.

This is an endearing cartoon story with enough double entendre for the grown ups in the room and enough heart for the kids (even the grown up ones).",1390694400,,925,4.341040462427745

5130322,4,B00846OYHM,"I caught ""Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Summer Vacation"" (hereafter TTA: HISMV) on my TV on the Hub channel (Channel 221 from Comcast) and therefore had to endure the commercials that stretched it out to two hours.  But that didn't matter - TTA:HISMV is a high-octane, whiplash-inducing, unfettered hunk of crazy animation fun.  Sure, it's all over the place, it has continuity and logic issues, and it is often gross and scary.  But hey, that has always been the Warner Bros. animation's specialty and TTA:HISMV is a worthy standard-bearer.

  Many of the posters here have already described what to expect from the feature film's -ahem- plot.  The title basically says it all; the Tiny Toon characters are on summer break from Acme Looniversity and have various zany vacation adventures.  There are two main plot threads: 1) the ingratiating Plucky Duck wangles a cross-country car trip to Happy World Land with Hamton Pig and his kooky family.  It's a loose spoof of ""National Lampoon's Vacation"". 2) Buster and Babs Bunny engage in a ""getting wet"" contest that gets way out of hand and washes them into a river environment straight out of ""Deliverance"" and Mark Twain's Mississippi River tales, and with their lazy, boneless mutt Byron dodge bayou dangers in an attempt to get back to Acme Acres.

  To say TTA: HISMV is free-wheeling, erratic, and nonsensical is an understatement.  It also has dangerous elements such as PETA nightmare Elmyra trying to find a ""kitty"" at a wildlife preserve and a Jason-like serial killer that manages to threaten Plucky, Buster, and Babs (so the plot threads do intersect).  But the movie is also engaging, fun, witty, and brimming with sometimes-dated but still humorous pop-culture references.  And it is a cartoon, and as Warner Bros. has said before in its classic animation shorts, anything can happen in a cartoon!  If you love Warner Bros. animation, you'll probably love TTA:HISMV.  If you insist on logic, character development, and themes, you're lost and should have taken a left turn at Albuquerque.  Otherwise, full speed ahead to Wackyland!

5130332,4,B00846OYHM,"Since this is my first review of anything relating to Tiny Toon Adventures, I figured I should give you my stance on the show in general.  Back in the 90's, this was one of my absolute favorite cartoons out there, and like any Tiny Toons fan back in the day, this movie was a favorite of mine.

Before I start reviewing the movie, I should cover the fact that Tiny Toon Adventures:  How I Spent My Vacation is an anomaly in both movies based off TV shows and of direct-to-video movies.  Movies based off TV shows tend to be inferior to their source material and direct-to-video movies generally aren't any good.  However, How I Spent My Vacation is both superior to the TV show source material (which is decent, if a bit aged) and is a direct-to-video movie that's actually good.  Now on to the review.

STORY

All the toons at Acme Looniversity are really happy when school lets out for the summer.  Buster and Babs Bunny (Charlie Adler and Tress MacNeille, respectively) get into a giant squirt gun fight that results in them floating down a river, embarking on creepy adventures in the rural parts of the country.  Plucky Duck goes with Hamton Pig (Joe Alaskey and Don Messick, respectively) and his family on a road trip to Happy World Land, and Plucky soon learns that riding with his family is one of the worst decisions he's ever made.  Fifi La Fume (Kath Soucie) yearns to see her favorite movie star, Johnny Pew (Rob Paulsen), and does almost anything to see him and eventually to make him happy.  Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) goes to the zoo in search of a new ""kitty witty"" (as Elmyra would say), and Fowlmouth (Rob Paulsen) bugs Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) to go on a date with her to the movies.

CHARACTERS

The way the characters are portrayed in this movie perfectly matches their personalities on the show.  The characters in this movie are done quite well, because aside from matching their original personas on the show, the characters themselves are interesting and enjoyable to watch.  Plucky was probably the most humorous and to an extent, the most sympathetic of the characters, as you know he really wants to have as most fun at Happy World Land as possible, and you can easily feel the pain he suffers by being with Hamton's family, who unintentionally keep him miserable through a bunch of antics.  Elmyra is probably the most hated character in the roster of Tiny Toons characters, and I can sorta  see why when watching the show, but thankfully in the movie, she's not on the screen as much, is less obnoxious, and is actually pretty funny at times.  Since Fifi didn't get as much time on the show compared to other characters, it was nice to see the movie give her more attention (and the humorous gags she's in).  Last but not least, Buster and Babs were a joy to watch on this movie, since their back-and-fourth antics kept me chuckling throughout.

HUMOR

One of the weaker links to the original Tiny Toons TV show was the fact that there were a good deal of jokes and gags that jabbed at early 90's pop culture, which usually didn't age well.  Thankfully, these types of jokes aren't as prominent in this movie, though there are a few gags that do show their age (such as Roseanne falling on Fifi as she's singing, and of Babs falling into the river and bumping into a bunch of characters parodying The Little Mermaid).

Like the classic Looney Tunes, most of the jokes and gags on this movie are more universal, and therefore, age much better.  Some of my favorite jokes and gags are when Buster rescues Babs with a life saver, and she says ""Who can think about candy at a time like this?,"" when Plucky gets drooled on by Hamton's Uncle Stinky and quickly gets disgusted when he sees where that ""refreshing shower"" came from, when Buster, Babs, and Bryon run into Eliot and ET in the moonlight, and when the psychotic hitchhiker loses his mind and tries to attack Plucky when Hamton's family drop him off.

APPEARANCE

The animation and artwork for this is really good.  Thankfully, when Warner Bros. had this movie made, they got Tokyo Movie Shinsa (one of the outsourced animation studios that made TTA episodes) to animate this movie, since that studio's quality of animation and artwork was the best of the studios ordered to make TTA animations.  It's also interesting to note that Tokyo Movie Shinsa was the same studio that animated Akira.

The art styles and color pallet perfectly match the TV show, and create a fun atmosphere that's perfect for this type of movie.

SOUNDTRACK

The soundtrack for this movie fits the style of movie really well, though I do admit that the background music could be a little more memorable.

THE DVD ITSELF

Tiny Toons fans have waited for many, many years for this movie to come out on DVD, and Warner Bros. honestly could have made a better DVD release for this.  I wasn't expecting much in the way of bonus features, but they could have at least touched up the picture quality a little and made a better-looking DVD menu, as the picture quality is a bit grainy and the menu looks like something a 15-year old whipped up on DVD-burning software on his laptop in a hurry.

FINAL WORD

Tiny Toon Adventures:  How I Spent My Vacation is certainly a gem in early 90's animated films, and if you're a Tiny Toons fan, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this movie ASAP.",1365292800,,5350,4.575026232948583

In fact, the quality was so poor, My wife asked if they just transferred this onto DVD from an old VHS tape found at a yard sale bargin bin.

How disappointed I am by this. However, its nice to have it on DVD even though the quality is about as bad as it gets.",1349740800,3,430,4.0588235294117645
5130344,2,B00846OYHM,"Well, I saw this in Costco yesterday and picked it up as it is one of my favorite movies from my childhood.  Me and my little brother used to rent this on VHS from our local rental place every year around the first of summer vacation.  The movie itself is great for a made for TV movie, it is just as good if not better than the series animation.  The show itself is five stars all the way, so why did I only give it two stars? . . .

The quality sucks.  If you put it into a computer and check the size it is only 3.7 GB, not even an entire 8 GB DVD, so they went the cheap rout and used a single layered DVD.  You can tell this when you play it because it is an interlaced DVD, google interlaced DVD for more info.  Basically this is for playing on OLD TVs not the current HDTV ones.  It also looks like they used an old VHS for the rip instead of using original sources or even a LaserDisc, those huge record sized DVD discs, they had a much higher quality than VHS and didn't degrade over time like VHS does.  If they ripped from one of those it would look much better.  They also didn't take much time on creating menus, when you go to watch trailers and switch languages it is a very boring plain blue menu with no sound.  I could have done a better job with free software on the menus.  Also, the discs were made in Mexico, they couldn't even splurge enough to have the made in the US.

I'm glad it is on DVD now but for something I have been waiting this long for I'm upset that it is such low quality.  I can up the quality a little by ripping it and running a decomb filter to get rid of the interlace but why the heck couldn't they have just put out a higher quality product?  I also know a few people with LaserDisc players, I might just buy the LaserDisc of this and have them rip it for me, burn it to DVD and put it in this case.  The case is nice and looks good with my other DVDs and Blurays.",1348704000,8,1909,3.9322916666666665
5130345,5,B00846OYHM,"Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation(1992) was one of the best selling direct-to-video movies of 1992. The film got positive to mixed reviews from critics and some people thought it was simply a compilation of Tiny Toons episodes. The film is an underrated cult classic and it's still funny. The students at Acme Looniversity go on summer vacation and they deal with unpleasant road trips, hungry predators, serial killers, theme parks, self-centered movie stars, and more. The writers also poked fun of George Lucas' THX Sound System! Footage from How I Spent My Vacation was recycled on the Tiny Toons TV show(episodes 97-100) with a narrator giving us a recap. An abridged version of How I Spent My Vacation was shown on the Fox Network. Tiny Toons is the ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" of the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies world. Bugs Bunny is in the show, but more emphasis is put on Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, and the rest. There were Tiny Toons video games for the Nintendo, Super Nintendo, and the Sega Genesis. Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose(1993) was one of the best.
This DVD is a decent package. There's video spots as extras. The video quality is a little fuzzy. I swear some prints of this movie are called ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation""! How I Spent My Vacation is packed with sardonic, inspired, gross out humor. It hasn't lost its fun factor in the past two decades.",1347494400,4,1416,4.760162601626016
5130346,3,B00846OYHM,"I have been waiting forever for this to finally come out on DVD. I had to resist the urge to just watch the readily available version online (that WB doesn't even seem to object to, as it has over a million views). When I finally got my DVD, I was disappointed by the ugly box art (they colored Babs' tooth red like they thought it was her lips or something), and they even spelled Hamton's name wrong on the back of the case multiple times (HamPton). But I figured I could overlook those things because I really just wanted to watch the movie. Well the movie looks like someone at WB bought a used VHS that some kid had watched 100s of times, and they made the DVD transfer with that. Seriously, it is significantly below VHS quality - very disappointing. I watched the online version afterwards, and it is much clearer. Still, I'm glad I bought it, because I want WB to know that there are still TTA fans out there and they need to release the rest of the series for us - maybe even with some bonus features and alternate retake footage that is missing from some of the season one episodes.",1347321600,4,1092,4.331707317073171
5130347,3,B00846OYHM,"Everyday after school, I believe it was 4:30, I would watch the Tiny Toon Adventures that aired from 1990-1992 (original series episodes), and continued to air in reruns for several years. In March 1992, Warner Home video released the direct-to-video Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, which some critics considered it to be odd because it was the first animated movie in the United States to be released straight to VHS and Laserdisc. The movie was a smash success selling over one million copies. The movie later aired as a four-part episode on Fox Kids.

In the movie, the Acme Looniversity school year is over and Buster & Babs Bunny (no relation) and the gang are excited to start their summer vacation. Buster and Babs start out by having a water gun fight, but then things turn ugly when they accidentally flood Acme Acres. They end up floating down the river, leading them down south to a riverboat, where they barely escape with their fur.

Meanwhile, Plucky Duck goes along with Hamton J. Pig and his parents across the country to the amusement park HappyWorldLand. Plucky must fight off a crazed hitchhiker, but what may kill him is putting up with the annoying Pigs, which all leads to a hilarious outcome at HappyWorldLand.

Furball, the cat, finally escapes the deadly clutches of Elmyra Duff, so Elmyra goes to a zoo and tortures the animals (she doesn't mean to harm anyone, she just plays too rough with them). Fifi Le Fume, the skunk, gets a date with the famous actor Johnny Pew, who doesn't want anything to do with her. Their date turns into a disaster leading them into the hands of Elmyra.

Once the series' original run ended, I moved on to other things, therefore I never got to see How I Spent My Vacation until it was released to DVD. I laughed all the way through the movie at the characters' slapstick humor and their clever puns to pop culture. I would give the movie a five-star review, but just like other reviewers have mentioned, the DVD quality is not the best, similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Season-1-Vol-1/dp/B0017INRGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiny Toon Adventures - Season 1, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiny-Toon-Adventures-Season-1-Vol-2/dp/B001PU8N26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiny Toon Adventures: Season 1, Vol. 2</a>. I have never seen the VHS version, so I'm not going to compare the DVD to it.

The film itself is fine, and doesn't look grainy. Another complaint is that the main menu is cheesy. I would have to agree it's cheesy, but a lot of other cartoons have the same menu style.

Here is a real review: of course the movie is barrels of fun, 90s popculture references, slapstick, satire, etc.  My favorite sequence is the megamultiplex and the spoof of the THX trailer.  Speaking of which, that sounded fantastic on the old VHS... here, no.  Now if you're thinking of buying the movie you already like it and my opinion of the actual film is irrelevant.  So...

What you really want to know: the quality?  Well it looks like a copy made from an old VHS.  A tipoff that this is at least an old transfer is the ancient timeworn anti-copy warning at the end that is as old as home video itself.  I cannot believe a cartoon, which hasn't much fine detail to begin with, can't look better on DVD than this.  I have DVDs of older animated movies (even another TV animated movie) that blow this out of the water.  This movie is over 20 years old, and it has Steven Speilberg's name on it.  Warner could have done better than this.  But they didn't.  Don't buy it.

When you buy a DVD, which has greater quality capacity than VHS, it should look better than the VHS.  This does not.  Shame on you, WB!",1346457600,13,1506,4.368231046931408

I am an avid collector of DVDs and Blu-rays and tried to give WB another chance with this movie since I have sworn off buying WB merchandise after being utterly disgusted between the horrendous job they did with the HP and the Deathly Hollows DVD and the mess know as UltraViolet.

As much as I love this movie, it so deserved better treatment... and that just proves that WB DOES NOT CARE...by continuing to show us customers no respect by these poorly done releases.

UPDATING to add that I have decided to return this. Only adults handle disks at our house (very carefully may I add) and somehow this disk has started to freeze. It froze about 24 minutes into the movie and I had to reset the player. Wanted to skip to where we left off and I realized there are no Chapter Selections on the main menu. In fact, I had to play the film and ""fast forward"" (yes, on a DVD!!!) to the part we left off on. I have no doubts this is a direct-from-VHS transfer!

5130354,4,B00846OYHM,"""Tiny Toon Adventures"" is one of those series that EVERYONE watched growing up in the 1990's. Its characters and humor were based on the classic Warner Bros. Looney Tunes shorts from the 1930's-1960's, but it developed a style of humor all its own, and eventually paved the way for another landmark series, ""Animaniacs"".

Produced by legendary film director Steven Spielberg and helmed by some of the best animators, musicians and voice actors ever (both in the U.S. and overseas), ""Tiny Toons"" took the cliche of turning classic cartoon characters into younger versions of themselves and turned it on its ear. Rather than simply kiddie-fying the Looney Tunes, ""Tiny Toons"" featured a cast of wacky characters who were their own entities. They were admirers and students rather than younger versions or direct offspring of Bugs Bunny and friends.

Arguably, this movie was the Tiny Toons' finest hour, showcasing their adventures on summer vacation away from their Looney professors at Acme Looniversity. Plucky Duck and Hamton Pig endure a road-trip from Hell with Hamton's family. Animal-torturing Elmyra goes to a drive-through safari zoo in search of a ""new kitty"", skinning a leopard and torturing a lion, panther and jaguar in the process. Fifi the skunk gets a date with movie star ""Johnny Pew"" and finds out he's a jerk. Shirley the Loon decides to finally accept Fowlmouth the rooster's invitation to a date, and it's a hilarious disaster. Buster and Babs Bunny get into a squirt gun fight that ends in Babs opening a floodgate and sweeping them down a river into a world full of hillbilly possums and hungry alligators.

All of these subplots manage to intertwine, all backed by a full musical orchestra, fluid animation produced in both the U.S. and Japan. Even if you've never seen the show, this film is a perfect place to start.

Direct-to-home-video movies based on cartoon series are a dime a dozen now, but this was one of the first, and it's good to see it get the DVD treatment, FINALLY. It loses a star for being so bare-bones and having such ugly cover art (c'mon, Warner!) with no bonus features whatsoever. Couldn't they have gotten the actors, directors, writers, musicians, ANYONE behind this gem to say a few words for a commentary or bonus feature?

At least it got a wide DVD release, and that's good enough for me.",1345766400,7,2343,4.906565656565657
5130355,3,B00846OYHM,"First off, I wanna say if I were just rating this movie alone it would be five stars. I grew up watching it as a kid and loved it. Especially Plucky's story line. It is pure classic 90's silver animation.

However, who else noticed how lazy they were with this DVD? It looks like a thirteen-year-old burnt it on his laptop. The menus are obviously templates and the themes have nothing to do with 'Tiny Toons' or Warner Bros. at all (except for the main menu). I expected the movie quality to be bad since it was converted from tape just like the episodes. But damn, it looks worse than it did on VHS. Hopefully no one who buys this will be watching it on a big screen. Your eyes may bleed.

Regardless, I'm glad it's out on DVD. I just wish they would have spent a little more time cleaning it up. 90's TV animation gets no respect in regards to video quality.",1345593600,44,861,4.2439024390243905
5130356,5,B00846OYHM,"As a kid I kinda liked this Direct-To-Video Movie. The Fowlmouth scenes were kind of ridiculous, but Fifi following Shirley's example, and dumping Johnny Pew the same way Shirley dumped ol' FM. We all knew she preferred Plucky over that rooster. But TTA:HISMV gets bought a TON of times, then we'll DEFINITELY see future releases, like TTA's Spring Break Special (with a cameo appearance by the Warner Brothers and their Sister, Dot!), Seasons 2 and 3, and the final TTA special, Night Ghoulery (with a cameo by The Brain)! And we might end up seeing releases for Animaniacs Volume 4, and Wakko's Wish.

5130357,5,B00846OYHM,"Over the years I have tried to collect movies from my childhood. You find many movies such as Rock-a-Doodle, Pebble and the Penguin, Land Before Time, etc. on DVD with no problem. I looked for this movie everywhere on DVD and had no such luck. Now with it coming out I can enjoy it like I was 5 years old all over again. It has very funny humor for any kid to watch and will be sure to put a smile on their face. I know it will put a smile on mine. When I do decide to have kids, this will be one of the many movies I will save so they can enjoy it too. There are way too many shows and movies out there for kids that are nothing like what I grew up watching. I definitely recommend this product to anybody, no matter their age.",1342051200,6,728,3.8926174496644297
5130358,4,B00846OYHM,"The Tiny Toons are back ! ('Bout time.) And this brand-new DVD is basically a redistribution of the direct-to-video movie release ""How I Spent My Vacation"". In it, your favorite cast of zany characters are all set for one crazy summer once the school bell rings. And frankly, it's obviously one ridiculous adventure after another.

First off, Babs Bunny attempts to spend her summer vacation catching some rays, until her plans are all wet (literally) no thanks to her boyfriend Buster. Pretty soon it's an all-out squirt gun war up until all of Acme Acres is totally submerged, sending our conejo couple (and Byron the Basset Hound) on a rollicking river raft adventure fraught with hillbilly possums, Southern-belle alligators, and Superman (Wait, what ?). Elsewhere, Plucky Duck decides to tag along with his good pal Hamton J. Pig on a family road trip to Happy World Land theme park. Plucky putting up with Hamton and his family is one thing, but then things get worse when they pick up a psycho hitchhiker along for the ride ! Other stories include Elmyra visiting a drive-through safari park where even the wild animals there don't take too kindly to her affections, Fifi La Fume dating the skunk hunk of her dreams (and of her nightmares), Dizzy Devil coping with his shedding hair, and Shirley the Loon being forced to see a summer blockbuster flick with the annoying Fowl Mouth.

It seems like a long summer for our friends, but still it's a fun movie that you'll enjoy. So anyway, this DVD seems not all there so to speak, but at least it's quite an opener for season two - whenever that comes out. So stay Tiny Tooned for new details coming soon !",1341878400,,1659,4.697594501718213
