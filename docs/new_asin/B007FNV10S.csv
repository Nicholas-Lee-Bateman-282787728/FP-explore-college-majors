5082589,5,B007FNV10S,"I'd heard many parts of this on the CD version.  Many times that's all you need for comedy.  Hannibal isn't an extremely physical comedian, but I do think the experience is enhanced by watching the set instead of just listening to it.

One of the neat things about Hannibal Buress is that he transcends the unfortunate box some African-American comedians seem to be stuck in.  His comedy (in this special) has nothing to do with his race.  (Just like the best Eddie Murphy) And while those types of jokes are funny (as is Mike Birbiglia's subversion), it can be tiring and repetitive.  So it's great to see Hannibal doing what European-American comics have always been doing - just talking about life in a funny way.

It's definitely worth the price and it's a must-buy if you get it when it's on sale.",1356912000,,802,4.605633802816901

5082596,4,B007FNV10S,"I first saw Hannibal Buress on a 15 minute Comedy Central spot.  Though he has a slow build style of humor, I found him to be really funny; especially after the first few minutes when you're learning his style.  However, I was curious as to how sustainable his style of humor really was.  Only Mitch Hedberg had successfully maintained a slow, stoner-type approach to comedy.  So when I saw that Hannibal had a full stand-up special, I was very interested to see if he could maintain his performance for an entire hour.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised, and am happy to say that Hannibal Buress is one of the most promising comedians working today.  His slow build style really rewards viewers who stay with him during the first few awkward minutes.  Once you grasp his personality, you can almost see the jokes coming, like those of a long time friend.  But even then, his delivery is always surprising and humorous.  Buress is definitely the kind of guy you want to invite to a party (so long as it's low key).",1427932800,,1013,4.583333333333333

5082598,5,B007FNV10S,Ridiculously hilarious! Hannibal Buress is so funny line after line. There isn't one lull in this performance and I had to constantly rewind it to catch parts that I missed because I was laughing so hard!,1423526400,,204,4.694444444444445

5082600,5,B007FNV10S,I am a huge Hannibal Buress fan ever since I saw him on Russell Howard's good news. This show represents his typical low key delivery and random observations. I would watch again in a few months when I forget the content.,1418860800,,221,4.414634146341464
5082601,1,B007FNV10S,Couldn't finish watching this. Dude is nowhere as funny as he thinks he is.,1418083200,,75,4.428571428571429
5082602,5,B007FNV10S,"Animal Furnace is Hilarious and much better than his Live from Chicago Special. I still gave him 5 stars for his Live from Chicago Special because I think he set the bar so high on Animal Furnace. You just wanted the same non stop laughter again and you didn't quite get it from Live from Chicago, but it was still so much more funny than so many other comedians out there. I hope he keeps developing new material and keeps us entertained for years to come. I'll be right there waiting for his 3td special or perhaps to see him if he performs in Dallas",1417737600,,552,4.266666666666667

5082611,5,B007FNV10S,"When I become a serious fan of a comedian it's rarely ever for their punchlines and much more often for their delivery.  Such was the case with Hannibal Buress.  It's a bit of a hybrid, where he lures you in with a very offhand, unenthusiastic style in the same vein as Stephen Wright.  The next thing you know though Hannibal's shouting louder than Sam Kinison as he does an impression of cancer responding to charity walks.  While he has obviously said these lines dozens of times already, Hannibal is still convincing when he cracks himself up.  Though he also doesn't waste too much time laughing at his own jokes(I'm looking at you Kevin Hart).  These aspects of his style combine to create a unique voice in the world of standup.  A voice that may not be appreciated by all, but should definitely be given a chance.

As for the DVD itself, the quality is exactly as expected for the format.  The bonus feature, ""A Week To Kill,""  is also excellent.  It offers a look at how Hannibal prepared for the special, as well as providing some perspective on what every comedian goes through while trying to perfect a one hour set for a DVD.

I would definitely recommend this to standup fans.",1404518400,2,1190,4.561320754716981

5082614,4,B007FNV10S,"Hannibal Buress is one of my favorite comics working today.  Animal Furnace (chosen because it rhymes with Hannibal Buress...you might have figured this out it took me forever...if you still don't get it just say ""Hannibal Buress Animal Furnace"" several times)

It's a departure from his self titled debut.  No more slacker, stoner delivery and a lot more volume, but still great.",1396742400,2,380,5.096774193548387

5082625,5,B007FNV10S,"Sort of Mitch Hedburg-ian in his non-sequiter style of comedy, Burress is a refreshingly original dead-pan comic.  His jokes will often veer off into a random direction with their punchlines.  Usually to great effect.  Also, for anyone tired of Hollywood pushing the falsehood that if you're from any big city in America, you sound like you're from New Jersey/New Yawk, Burress's very distinct Chicagoan accent only adds to his appeal.",1390780800,2,435,5.185714285714286

5082629,4,B007FNV10S,"Fresh, strong comedy, and a raw, developing style. This isn't a polished set like you'd see out of Louis CK-- instead it feels more like you're in a comedy club, with Buress shooting around, finding his expression. It's a lot of fun, and all the more so because it's plain to see he has raw talent. A lot of stuff to appreciate, and a few LOLs. Good use of your night.",1366243200,3,368,4.197183098591549
