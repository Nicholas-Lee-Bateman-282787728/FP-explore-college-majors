This musical video is truly uplifting. The videos go hand in hand with the songs that he sings in them. My favorite song/video is ""America Again,"" and ""Great God"" which was filmed in the United Kingdom. I've yet to see other christian videos as beautifully put together as these two.
I can't wait to purchase other videos that Carman has filmed. His songs are very inspirational and thought provoking. Although some songs seem to be too preachy, his message comes across loud and clear: God is a great God, we need God in America again, and we need to serve the Lord.",1008720000,,752,4.536764705882353
