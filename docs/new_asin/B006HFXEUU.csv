8498353,1,B006HFXEUU,"I bought it for my 3 yr old grandson because he was interested when he saw the commercial in another movie. He barely watched to the end and every time I ask him if he wants to watch it he says ""no thank you"" . I think kids are the best judges of everything so that's why I gave this movie(I bought two by the way) one lonely star:(",1418428800,,332,3.8260869565217392
