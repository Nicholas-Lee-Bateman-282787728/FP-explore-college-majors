Louis Gossett Jr. isgreat in the movie and your kids will love this picture. Why? Well guess what: a bunch of smart kids steal a couple of F-16's to rescue a downed fighter pilot...
I've seen it countless times and I'm glad to have it in my collection. Amazon is the only place I've been able to buy it from so get it now!
This is an instant family classic for ages 10 and up. Enjoy!  END",946080000,,495,4.15625
11973,1,0767827686,"Just read the review posted by ""century19@worldnet.att.net"" below.  He hits it perfectly.
There are some films that try to be something MORE than they are.  B-Movies are awful,  everyone knows it.  Movies like Iron Eagle, Red Dawn, Batman & Robin, and Alien:  Resurrection are trying to be something they are not; attempting to be  better than they actually are by throwing more money at it, casting bigger  stars, rewriting the already confusing script to cover the plot holes, or  just painting the screen with violence and explosions so they can get the  male crowd to buy the ticket.  This film is rife with so many alarming  problems that make you wonder how funding for it got off the ground.  But,  it was mid-eighties and the Cold War, so we needed flicks that flexed the  American military might and insulted Middle Eastern countries.  This film  is an embarassment to the US Air Force (yes, I am a member) and is  characteristic of America's skewed prejudice of Middle Eastern countries.  The generalized depiction of these people is abhorrent and frankly very  embarassing to watch.  No wonder America seems to not understand that  region of the world.  We take movies more at face value than we should.  If  you want to kick back and just watch it and veg, fine.  Just don't think  it's a realistic and deep film.  It isn't.
Easily the top film on my  list as the worst ever.  Funny thing is, if it's on, I watch it so I can  amuse myself by ripping it apart.  I guess you could watch it for the  flying sequences.  But, if you're going to do that, why don't you just buy  a video on military aircraft then.
Leonard Maltin said it, ""not  boring, just stupid.""  No kidding.  The DVD would make a good  frisbee...",946080000,4,1723,4.582781456953643
11974,5,0767827686,One of my favorite movies as a kid.  My friends and I burned through two copies of this movie when we were in 6th grade.  I still remember putting on our fathers fire gear pretending we were in the cockpit with Doug  Masters!!!!!!!!,924825600,,232,4.348837209302325

11992,5,0767827686,"It's still a fun watch after all these years and what a trip back in time!  Who doesn't like watching F-16s blow stuff up?! The aerial scenes and effects are pre-CGI and not as well done as in Top Gun.  The low budget effects don't detract from the story and has that fun 1980s cheesy feeling that you get after being spoiled by 20+ years of improved special effects.  Louis Gossett Jr is great, the guy who plays protagonist ""Doug"" isn't toooo bad and who knew that ""Katie"" (Doug's girlfriend) would make such a great career for herself after such a tiny part in this movie.  It stinks that it's not ""for rent"" as I've watched it exactly 3 times since it first hit video, but the ""buy"" price is pretty cheap.",1509926400,,709,4.348484848484849

12039,5,0767827686,"This movie came out when I was a grade school kid and I ate it up right away. I lived in the shadows of an Air Force Base, watching F-16's fly over every day. I never missed the chance to look up and watch them bank hard and climb fast.
I wore through my VHS copy of this movie as a kid. As I grew up, and even worked in security at that same air force base,  I have come to realize how incredibly ridiculous this storyline is but that hasn't made the movie any less enjoyable for me. I recently was able to sit down with my son and share the magic with him.
There's something about a story where a kid gets to save his father that reaches deep into every young boy. This movie couples that with the idea that, even as a kid, you could be a fighter pilot.
You will never be asked to suspend disbelief more than you will for this film, and it's totally worth it.",1488412800,,861,3.976878612716763

The extremely common 80's theme of using computers to make anything possible is repeated in this film.  This flick gets by only with generous displays of sexy jets and fancy flying.  I love the movie because I have a thing for military planes, but the acting stinks, the plot is full of holes, and the characters are uninteresting.  I would have been just as happy watching 90 minutes of random f-16 footage.  This is the discount store version of Top Gun, but a guilty pleasure for me.",1473638400,,565,4.5

12113,4,0767827686,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. I learned about it after reading ""Ready Player One"" by Ernest Cline. The dog fights could easily rival those of Top Gun. The story focuses on a teenage boy that has had flight training in Air Force jets complements of his pilot father. The bullying and typical teenage whining, I could have done without, but it took away little from the overall story. It was well done throughout, and I've added it to my permanent collection of re-watchable movies.",1470528000,2,495,4.636363636363637

The acting isn't that wonderful, except for Louis Gosset Jr.  His amazing acting actually seems to underscore how bad the rest of the cast is.  They aren't horrible, they just aren't as good as him.  The story is solid, and the bad guy is meh, but the sheer awesomeness this movie contains makes it worth watching.  That and the soundtrack.

As an adult, it's absolutely ridiculous that it has attained as high of an average rating on Amazon as it has.  It is clearly the most ridiculous plot in movie history, and it's sequels are so incredibly horrible you have to wonder how they ever got a green light to proceed past the, ""Hey, you know what?  We should make a movie where teenage deliquents fly a bunch of vintage planes"" stage, let alone got funded.  This is what post cold war America spent your tax dollars on, apparently.

Ludicrous.  For a great double feature of classic American BS though, follow this up with Delta Force.  You really can't go wrong if you're hungover and don't really want to watch a movie, but can't do anything but watch a movie.",1466035200,,792,4.383561643835616

12198,5,0767827686,"I must give it five star because it is a great experience in what can be done if you believe in your self from the start, and it shows the self worth of a man willing to risk it all.  It also shows the love of a son for his father, and puts down the hate of a corrupt man unwilling to bend to keep the peace.

12217,5,0767827686,A very good movie that didn't receive much attention during the time of release due to it being around the same general time frame as the overly publicized release and marketing spectacle that was Top Gun a few months later.  Its lackluster sales made it hard to find for many years.  Finally a HD version has finally been made available which is a huge improvement.

12253,5,0767827686,"Sure, it's cheesy by today's standards, but Iron Eagle was one of my favorite movies as a kid when it first came out.  While reading Ernest Cline's latest book, Armada, I was reminded of how much I enjoyed it, and I thought I would share it with my kids, who are now about the same age as I was when I first saw the movie.

Unfortunately, the version of the movie that Amazon streams has a flaw with the audio encoding (thus the reason for only 3 stars).  I purchased the HD version and watched it streamed via the Roku app on a 1080p / 5.1 home theater system.  The picture quality was great, but the sound quality was terrible.  It sounded as if some of the audio channels were out of phase with the others, as you could hear the dialog coming from separate speakers at a slightly different time (within milliseconds), but it was just enough to make the dialog very difficult to understand.  In addition, the dialog seemed muffled compared to the rest of the audio.  I've never had this problem before on any other 5.1 movie that I've streamed to the same home theater system, and I even tried cycling the power to everything and rebooting the Roku, with no success, so I'm convinced the flaw is in the encoding of the movie itself.  (I have not yet tried watching the movie using the 2-channel audio stream, so I cannot confirm if it has a similar problem.)

Update 8/19/2015 - So I have to retract what I said before about the poor 5.1 audio encoding of this movie and update my overall rating.  After posting my original review, I watched another movie streamed by Amazon and noticed the same exact problem.  After doing some investigation, I discovered that my kids inadvertently changed some settings on my home theater system, which was causing the audio problem I was having.  I've since corrected the settings, and the movie plays back just fine now.",1439164800,3,1860,4.519402985074627

If you can stand the concept, a teenager and his friends who practically run a military base because they are basically con artists and all the adults are incompetent, steel two F-16s in an attempt to rescue his father who has been captured by Unnamed Middle East Country Number One.  Nothing in this movie takes itself seriously, so don't even try to.  It also features a race between a Cessna and a motorcycle, yes, because you can totally race a airplane with a dirt bike.  If you go in expecting a bunch of cheesy one liners, guys putting on/taking off sunglasses every 5 minutes, explosions, and an awesome 80s soundtrack you won't be disappointed.

12378,4,0767827686,"Iron Eagle is a 1980s fighter pilot film with an enjoyable fiction narrative. The movie focuses on a teenager, Doug Masters, gaining flight experience from a veteran F-16 Pilot. The film is geared to provide an entertaining action story, and Doug's accelerated desire to fly in combat is to rescue his dad who has been shot down in the Middle East. The soundtrack and hairstyles in this movie will take you deep into the 1980s! This is a combat motion picture that is palatable to a wider audience as it doesn't contain excessive violence.

Louis Gossett junior puts a superb performance as a veteran fighter pilot who teaches Doug Masters to fly an f-16 and use its weapons. a bit unrealistic but its not a serious war film , I know Arab Air Air forces have performed poorly throughout the 20th century but I don't think they would be able to lose to 17 year old kid with few days f-16 practice. The movie was made during the cold war so their was no chance of using real mig's, the planes were used as mig's were Israeli Kfir jets,(itself an unliscenced copy of a French Mirage III/5 series.)",1292544000,,646,4.383333333333334
12392,4,0767827686,"Doug Masters (Jason Gedrick) is a high-school senior and an Air Force brat, the son of fighter pilot Col. Ted Masters (Tim Thomerson), a daring Cessna pilot and a hopeful AF pilot himself.  While awaiting his graduation on a base somewhere in the Southwest, he gets the word that his father has been forced to eject over a hostile Middle Eastern country (probably Libya), captured, tried, and condemned to death.  The Federal government doesn't seem to want to do anything to get him out, but Doug isn't giving up.  With the help of a band of dedicated friends, other AF kids who call themselves ""the Eagles,"" he obtains intelligence, fuel, computer time, maps, ammo, even a fraudulent flight plan (it helps that one of his best pals, Milo Bazen (Robbie Rist), is the son of the top Intel officer on base), then ropes Reserve Col. Charles ""Chappie"" Sinclair (Lou Gossett) into serving as his wingman in a desperate transatlantic flight to rescue the Colonel.

The story may be a bit improbable, and the '80's opinions may not be PC, but you forget that once Doug gets into the air, whether in his Cessna or piloting a ""borrowed"" F-16 and hammering the living daylights out of enemy installations.  Indeed, in a world where American tolerance for military risk seems to diminish with every year that goes by, the movie is the kind that may just reignite your patriotism.  The aerial sequences are fantastic and worth the price in themselves, and whatever you say against Doug's methods, two things you have to grant him: he's brave as a lion, and he's not giving up till he saves his father.  This is a story about courage, family connectedness, friendship, and being willing to risk your future and your life for what you think is right.",1274918400,,1737,4.731788079470198

But, as it is with music comparisons, you can't look at Iron Eagle as a Top Gun rip off, it is in my opinion more entertaining and way better in it's own right.

12400,4,0767827686,"Jason Gedrick, Louis Gossett Jr., and Tim Thomerson star in this high-flying 80s action film about a pilot who is shot down and the lengths his son will go to save him.

Thomerson stars as Col. Ted Masters.  He and his wingman are on a routine mission over the Mediterranean Sea when they are jumped by MIGs from a middle-eastern country.  The name of the country is never given, but, due to the time when the movie was made, it can be assumed to be Libya.  Masters and his wingman manage to shoot down three MIGs, but Masters himself is eventually shot down and captured.

Meanwhile, Ted's son Doug (Gedrick) has become a fairly good pilot himself.  He and his friends have their own flying club, and they enjoy flying their Cessnas on the weekends.  Doug has an enemy in school who challenges him to fly ""the snake"", a dangerous canyon near the air force base.  Doug accepts and, even though someone messed with his plane, Doug still manages to win.  However, his victory is short-lived, for he soon finds out about his father's capture and impending trial.

The U.S. Government is powerless to assist Doug's father, and Doug soon learns that his father has been found guilty of spying and is going to be hanged in three days.  With no other options available to him, Doug concocts his own plan to fly in and free his father himself.  He enlists the help of Col. ""Chappy"" Sinclair (Gossett).  Chappy is a retired pilot who lives on the base.  He's extremely reluctant to help Doug with his far-fetched plan but, after thinking it over, he decides to go along with it.

Now its up to Doug's friends to somehow come up with two fully-loaded F-16s with a full combat load, refueling schedules, approved flight plans, and other necessary logistics to pull the plan off.  Sure enough, Doug's friends somehow manage to make all the necessary arrangements and Doug and Chappy are soon winging their way across the Med.  Will they succeed in rescuing Doug's father, or will they be too late?

I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  Granted, the story is extremely far-fetched, but the action sequences are very good.  Gossett does a good job as Chappy, and Gedrick gives a good performance as Doug.  Fans of great action-adventure movies won't want to miss Iron Eagle.",1210550400,,2259,4.654040404040404
12401,4,0767827686,"Little Doug Masters (Jason Gedrick) has an Air Force pilot for a father, an incredibly irresponsible father who has been allowing him to fly training missions since, evidently, Doug hit puberty.  The kid has more simulator time than anyone on base (wherever that may be).  He's so into flying that he has a club of fellow high school aviators - officers' kids - who take their personal planes out on the weekends for fun...and to race paint-huffing morons on dirt-bikes through treacherous mountains.  He's a whiz at flying (but not acting).  Doug's happy little world halts when he finds out that not only did his application to the Air Force Academy get denied, but his father was also shot down, captured, and scheduled for a hanging in an undisclosed Middle Eastern country.

Doug enlists the help of his flying buddies (two of which are Styles from Teen Wolf and the gay dude from Revenge of the Nerds) to hatch a rescue plan.  Along the way he manages to get the help of a retired Air Force Colonel named Chappy Sinclair (Louis Gossett Jr.) who just happens to have flown with Doug's father.  After the two find out that the U.S. government has their hands tied in red tape, Col. Chappy decides to put a plan into action.  He'll require the considerable talents, connections, and tricks of each member of the flight club.  They'll have to steal maps, get top secret armament information of the enemies, hack into government computers to get F16s with enough ammo (and flight plans) to take on an entire Arab country, and exploit every moron the Air Force could possible assemble on one facility in order to save Doug's father.

After all the training, the shenanigans, and the ubiquitous 80s montage in which Louis Gossett Jr. shakes it to an old jukebox, the training mission gets the go ahead, and it's up to Doug and Chappy to rescue Doug's father from the evil, Arab terrorists (and not face long-term prison when and if they get back).

For people who moan and groan about movies all the time for not being plausible, especially movie critics, I say ""just grow up!"" Movies are supposed to be about entertainment. Leave it to the movies based on true stories to be the so-called plausible ones.

The reason I gave this review a 1-star rating is not because of the movie itself, but because of the horrible DVD. It's the only one available as far as I know here in the U.S. It's in ""full screen"" format, which means edited for old televisions and not in its original widescreen format. That, of course, means a lot of the picture is cut off. The so-called 5.1 surround sound is just as bad, with little detectable sound from separate audio channels.

As I grew older I realized that the effects in it were low budget, the plot was a little on the far fetched side (a group of high school kids getting into maximum security areas? Gotta love the 80s!), and the battle scenes were unlikely.(how many times did Doug's F-16 fire that same missile?) However this is just a fun movie to watch! The movie shines for one of the best characters ever; Col. Chappy Sinclair made so memorable by the great Louis Gossett Jr. I was very dissapointed in the DVD not being available in widescreen but then again I never have seen it in widescreen so I don't know what I missing. It does have a few special features but none worth watching again. If no one out there has ever watched this series, watch the first one and leave it at that, just like the filmmakers should have done!

The only little flaw from the movie was the firing of the Maverick AG Missile while the F-16 was still on the ground but hey it was very easy to shrug it off.

12413,2,0767827686,"Ahh, ""Iron Eagle"".  A classic of the 1980's Golan-Globus production mill.  With the current spate of historic/""current"" military movies, it's sometimes good to see how Hollywood's come in trying to get the details right.  One can't do much better than using this flick as a baseline.  In case you aren't already familiar with this gem, Louis Gosset Jr. playing a reserve Air Force Colonel, and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed Arab country -OK I'll name it:  Libya- to rescue the kid's dad.  Pop gets shot-down when he's intercepted in international waters, but the US refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure.

The kid and Lou Gosset meet up when the kid's challenged to race the local bully with his PLANE while the bully's using his dirt bike.  Suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe; he doesn't get his slot at the USAF Academy, though. You gotta take the bad with good I guess.  When the words on Dad get back to the family, this kid uses his base ""network"" to get access to imagery, enemy air defense data, and two F16s carrying a B52's worth of ordinance.  All of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents, no less.  (If only strike planning was this easy.)  Of course, the kid has flown training missions with his dad, and has a boatload of simulator time, so he's a natural to fly the mission.  He convinces Gosset to go along with him, and his two-ship is on the way.  The flying scenes are nothing spectacular, with obviously Israeli F16s playing the good guys, and Kfirs (modified Mirages) acting as MiGs.  Cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer; I'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft.  These are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit, flight, and combat models.  Anyway, lots of explosions on the way in, Lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure.  He manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land (!) and pick him up.  More silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground, taxi's out and takesoff.  He kills the bad guy and heads home to find Lou punched out and was rescued.  Rather than the prison sentence for espionage, and theft of government property that Lou, the kid, his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should've got, he gets his slot at the Air Force Academy.  The end.

Overall, I guess Lou's performance was fairly good, but everyone else performed at the grade-B level this flick is.  Note especially a very young Shawnee Smith as one of the kid's buds.  Worth seeing for laughs, and as a film version of a kid's pilot fantasy.",1092700800,6,2708,4.568464730290456

I am not sure if Chappy should be hanging out with little boy though, that could be bad. You know what they say ""16 will get you 20"". You just have to watch this film, you too will be swept away by the passion that Chappy exudes.

At the time, it made me want to strap myself into the cockpit of an F-16 and go bomb some terrorist country. I found Libya on the map. They seemed like some onery folk at the time. I was ready to drop some hellfire on them 'camel jockeys'.
But I could never get a hold of an F-16.
But judging by some of the reviews here, some lucky peepsqueaks DID manage to get F-16's. So many youths cite this piece of dreck as the reason they joined the airforce and are now doing the will of a commander-in-chief who probably goes back to his ranch, closes the door, and puts the 'Iron Eagle' DVD on!!
Ultimate boys movie indeed.
This doesn't change the fact that 'Iron Eagle' is unabashedly racist. It was mostly filmed in Israel with the IDF and Israeli government providing all the fighter jets AND pilots along with the scenery. All they asked for in return was that the villains be (nameless, faceless, dehumanized) 'Arabs' from a fictional (generic) Arab 'terrorist country'. This demonization of an entire people was (and is) an Israeli government PR campaign to get the American public to see the 'plight of the Jewish people' as they 'struggle' against the 'evil Arab terrorists'.
I would hope the producers of 'Iron Eagle' were duped into going along with this. Because other than that, it is a pretty fine movie. Unlike a lot of 80's action-movie dreck, 'Iron Eagle' actually has likeable characters. Louis Gosset Jr. delivers a fine performance as the 'tough but fair' Colonel 'Chappy' Sinclaire. The action sequences rival and sometimes better the ones in 'Top Gun'. Plus, there is no sappy romance sub-plot to drag this puppy down. This movie is purely a boys film.
So if you can turn your brain (and your conscience) off for an hour and 20 minutes, get a hold of 'Iron Eagle'. But watch out for the sequels. They're bad. Really bad.",1073520000,2,1904,4.586510263929619

However, this inane and unplausible plot is not saved by the thrill of a boy hopping in a slick military plane and the ensuing ""save the world"" 8-year-old fantasy.

12441,3,0767827686,"Jason Gedrick is Doug Masters, teen-pilot ace, son of a USAF fighter pilot, AF academy hopeful and high-school failure.  Doug is normally not that responsible a kid (mostly when tooling around in low-level air races in the family Cessna), but is forced to mature when his father is shot down and taken prisoner over an unnamed mideastern country.  A naturally gifted pilot, Doug has managed to cajole his father into taking him on some practice flights in the past, as well as worming his way into the base's F-16 simulator.  Now with the help of ""Chappy"" Sinclair (Louis Gosset Jr.), a crusty but not rusty reserve fighter pilot, and some of Doug's friends - a click of army-brat and aviation enthusiast-teens who populate the unnamed desert air force base where Doug's father stages - the younger Masters plans an impossible rescue.  Together with Chappie, Doug seizes a pair of twin-seat F-16's, loads them up to maximum payload, and flies into hostile territory.
This movie came out in late 1985 and would have been toast had it appeared about six months later when ""Top Gun"" was released.  The premise is improbable, the flight scenes suffer in comparison to those in ""Top Gun"" (instead of the carefully choreographed dogfights and editing, IE has plenty of footage of the F-16's digital instruments - the flight scenes themselves look like stock footage and repetitive at that), special effects aren't great (enemy jets explode like toy models; the MiG blasted on the ground is not only an obvious dummy, but shot at the angle to make that most obvious; the sound is horrible)  and the realism is also pretty low apart from the premise - fully loaded F-16's aren't in any condition to dogfight (at least until the advent of the AIM-120 missile well after this movie came out), while flack guns seem almost entirely non-existent and enemy jets simply explode with the push of a button.
Still, this was a fun movie and seemed to capture that sense of harmless (for our side anyway) jingoism of Reagan's 2nd term.  The plot goes a surprisingly long way into dealing with the inherent implausibility (Doug is good, but he's rough and his limits are well mapped out).  Also, much of the reason that IE falls behind TG has to do with the fact that F-16 isn't as photogenic as the F-14 (not that it's ugly - simply that it's smaller and hard to spot.  You simply see a speck that becomes an F-16 and disappears again in a flash, a deficiency on film that most F-16 pilots would doubtless prefer to live with).  The Israeli Kfir jets are quite convincing stand-ins for the MiG-23 (at the time, the US Marines flew leased Kfirs in dissimilar air-combat training), and only the most annoying military aviation enthusiasts will harp on how the USAF F-16's in the movie are painted according to Israeli colors (and how single-seat F-16A's mysteriously morph into twin-seat F-16B's and vica-versa).  Most of all, this was the first jet movie I'd really seen, and it was impressive enough for me to plunk down ($) for my first computer flight-sim program.  On a side-note, the soundtrack comes with ""One Vision"" by Queen, but the rest of the songs aren't up to that.  To get the song, I'd recommend Queen's own ""A Kind of Magic"" which also has some great tracks from the first Highlander movie.",1007856000,,3286,4.753954305799649
12442,3,0767827686,"This movie is not quite as bad as some of the comments want you to believe. It does have some serious reality flaws. But that's exactly where it excels. This is not a story about a kid trying to rescue his dad. This is a story about the flying fantasies of youth. I grew up playing quite a few flight simulators on computers, and this added to my fantasy of someday flying a fighter jet. This is exactly what this movie's about, a kid completely enthralled with flight simulations that he becomes a good pilot.
They should have left it at that though. The kid's fantasy of rescuing his dad (also a pilot) from some mysterious middle eastern base should not have been brought to reality. Reality should not have extended past his races in his single-engine crop-duster with a motorcycle. Throughout the movie, the kid does not see the world as a dangerous place. He still sees it as one big simulation. This is exactly how you should watch the movie, otherwise, it will seem like a ridiculous plot that's out-of-touch with the real world.",978652800,,1037,4.580645161290323
12443,4,0767827686,OK. It's NOT a documentary on the military (thank goodness).  It's eye candy. It's ear candy. It's just a fun movie. It's one you'll want to add to your collection.,974073600,,164,4.466666666666667
12444,5,0767827686,"This movie inspired me to pursue my life long dream of becoming president of the national Iron Eagle Fan Club.  Twisted Sister did, in fact, play a very cool tune in the movie.  Here is a little snippet.  ""We're not gone uh take it. Oh we ain't gone uh take it.  We're not gone uh take it anymoooooooooooore.""  The dialogue is Shakespearean worthy and the Grandmaster would have a hard time creating this involving interaction between characters.  If you want to see a very moving film that inspires everyone on the planet to become fighter pilots that are 17, rescue their dad from some OPEC country, then get down to that video store and be ready for a real treat.",973641600,,666,4.508333333333334

12447,3,0767827686,"Maybe Iron Eagle is not one of the best movies but it is still a lot of fun. I especially liked the soundtrack which i own on CD. But 3 of the best songs were not included. These were ""Were not gonna take it"" from  Twisted Sister, ""Eyes of the World"" from Eric Martin and  ""old enough to rock & roll"" from Rainey Haynes. The first 2  were available on CD but the last one is a bit of a problem. My question:  Is the song ""Old enogh to rock & roll"" from Rainey Haynes  available on CD? I have searched the internet without succes. Is there  anyone outthere who can help me? Please mail me!

Who cares about the bad bits, and who says everything you see has  to be believable? Just enjoy it for what it is",949190400,,337,4.6

Won't give away the plot but this is a great deal good adventure comedy that is perfect for all ages. you'll be cheering laughing and having a great and enjoyable evening .",1517616000,,523,4.684782608695652
