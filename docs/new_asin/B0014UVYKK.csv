8256452,5,B0014UVYKK,"The entire TheCentury: America's Time series is a very good overview of the 20th Century -- and since it was made in the late 1990s it has filmed recollections of some very important eyewitnesses to the century who are no longer with us -- have a look at Steve Jobs commenting on the computer revolution of the 1980s, for example. If you want to be hypercritical you can find hints of American Exceptionalism in places, but in general this is a very solid, balanced look at the USA from 1900 to 2000.",1329004800,4,500,4.445652173913044
