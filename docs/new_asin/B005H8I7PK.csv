8588337,4,B005H8I7PK,"I watched this show from beginning to end several times before buying the DVD and loved it: on my local TV station, and also online at several different sites. Jo Yeojeong shines as Seonu Inyeong -- she displays a wide range of emotions, from sparkly/bubbly/happy to angry to sad to frustrated to enthusiastic to warm and loving. Choi Yeojin as Park Seoyeon and Choi Songhyeon as Kang Hyeonju are the perfect foils, one playing the wild, worldly girl with many casual flings and the other playing the naive, lonely conservative who has trouble hooking up with any man. Jo Yeojeong's chemistry with Kim Jeonghoon as boyfriend Kim Seongsu is magical. All in all, we can identify in some way with each of the major characters. Seonu Inyeong's most admirable quality is that even though she keeps getting knocked down, she pops back up and finds another way to be happy, so the viewer keeps looking forward to her next success.

The major downside is that when you get to episode 4, the English subtitles go all to hell, and if you don't know Korean they're largely incomprehensible. A working knowledge of Chinese would probably help, too, because many of the errors are obviously machine translations of the Chinese translation of the original Korean. For example, Park Seoyeon's first name suddenly becomes ""Swiss study"" or ""Swiss investigation"" or even ""Rui Yan."" Whoever supplied these subs cheated the publisher big-time, and in turn they cheated us. Subtitles improve from incomprehensible to merely bad in the last two episodes (15-16).",1330992000,,1540,4.992217898832685
