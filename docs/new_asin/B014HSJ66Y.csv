7406396,4,B014HSJ66Y,"Marguerite is set in 1921, not far from Paris, where Marguerite Dumont has invited an array of music lovers to a party at her castle. No one knows much about the host except that she is wealthy and has devoted her entire life to music. Marguerite (Catherine Frot) is an amateur soprano who loves opera but sings terribly out of tune. Because her audience never summons the courage to let on how awful she is, Marguerite lives in a bubble, acting the role of diva. When a journalist writes a rave tongue-in-cheek article on her latest performance, Marguerite starts to believe even further in her talent, giving her the motivation to follow her dream.

Though fiction, Marguerite is inspired by the real-life story of American socialite Florence Foster Jenkins, who will soon get her own big-screen biopic, starring Meryl Streep. Writer/director Xavier Giannoli incorporates lots of funny moments predicated on Marguerites sincere self-delusion, but also manages to make her sympathetic. Reminiscent of the fairy tale The Emperors New Clothes, the movie shows how her social circle maintains and feeds the illusion that she is a superb artiste.

Ms. Grot conveys a sad vulnerability and innocence, making us feel for the woman beneath the cartoonish surface. Interestingly, director Giannoli has given his leading character nearly the same name as Hollywoods own Margaret Dumont, hapless foil for the Marx Brothers in numerous 1930s films.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include an interview with writer/director Xavier Giannoli, 4 deleted scenes, and theatrical trailer. The film is in French, with English subtitles.",1471564800,2,1623,5.258687258687258
7406397,4,B014HSJ66Y,"""Marguerite"" (2015 release from France; 128 min.) brings the story, ""inspired by true events"" we are reminded at the beginning of the film, of socialite Marguerite Dumont. As the movie opens, it is ""September, 1920"", and we are at a private recital, with a goal of raising funds for the war orphans. When Marguerite, who headlines and generously sponsors the program at the same time, finally comes on, she sings.... completely off-key. Yet people clap and adore her. Why? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from French quality director Xavier Giannoli who previously brought us other high quality films like ""When I Was A Singer"" and ""In the Beginning"". Here he tackles a variation of ""the emperor has no clothes"" story. It is clear to anyone that Marguerite cannot hold a note, yes she gathers acclaim, be it because people think she is brave enough to do it, and/or because she is delusional, and/or because people want to remain in her good graces. When, in preparation for her first bi-scale public concert, her exasperated music teacher comments to Marguerite's husband ""Who will throw the first stone?"", that becomes the main point of the movie: will Marguerite be told the stone-cold truth or not? Catherine Frot brings a towering performance as Marguerite, and in fact won the French equivalent of the Best Actress Oscar for this (the movie was nominated for a BUNCH of Cezar Awards, including Best Film and Best Director). My only complaint is that at 2 hr. 10 min. the movie is a bit too long for its own good. I think that trimming 15-20 min. would've made for a tighter movie without losing any of the narrative. The ""inspired by true events"" line at the beginning in fact refers to New York socialite Florence Foster Jenkins, and coincidence or not, a movie about her, starring none other than Meryl Streep in the title role, is set for a release in US theaters in just a few months (August, I believe). I'll be interested in checking out that one too, to see how it compares with this.

""Marguerite"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely, somewhat to my surprise. Maybe the fact that the Meryl Streep movie is coming out soon (and is already gathering buzz for Streep's supposedly stunning performance) has increased the interest in seeing the French movie version. Regardless, if you like classical music (of which there is a TON in the movie) and are up for a top-notch foreign movie with great performances, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Marguerite"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

*UPDATE"" August '16 I just saw the Meryl Streep movie, and I have to say, it's just a bit better than this movie. Streep's performance is jaw-dropping, Add to that the NY set (where it all took place in 1944, including several key scenes at Carnegie Hall), and it all feels fantastic.",1463356800,18,3017,4.775862068965517
8730785,4,B014HSJ66Y,"I agree with those who say this movie surpasses ""Florence Foster Jenkins.""  Having the story be fictional gives greater flexibility and allows the message to come through a little clearer (i.e. that we should all use empathy when laughing at someone and consider the harm we may be doing to a good soul).",1488672000,,304,4.735849056603773
8730786,5,B014HSJ66Y,"This is far better than ""Florence Foster Jenkins"".  Performances are more nuanced and movie is multi-layered.",1487203200,,109,5.8125
8730787,5,B014HSJ66Y,"I saw this in Netflix and liked it so much, I bought the DVD. It's the story of a woman whose love of music encouraged her to sing. What she failed to realize was that she had a terrible voice. But she was so charming and so fragile, her husband and friends did all they could to protect her from the truth. Marvelous acting by Catherine Frot as Marguerite, a wealthy woman living near Paris in the Roaring 20s. Great costumes and make-up. Frot is magnificent as Marguerite.",1484265600,,474,4.3977272727272725
8730788,5,B014HSJ66Y,"This is a terrific film  Funny as hell and touching, too.",1481587200,,57,4.181818181818182
8730789,4,B014HSJ66Y,"Just about everything seen in this movie is ugly to our senses, which makes it an uncomfortable and awkward entertainment piece. Even the artsy cinematography at times seems as unappealing and as gritty as a war movie. But entertaining it is as we watch and feel the cruelty and pity that comes with withholding the truth. This film is a very unique experience. A quote well placed in the movie is one that gives definition and reason to the cast of ugly characters and their guilty complicity; ""who will throw the first stone.""

It's a tragedy that, like most tragedies, could have been avoided had there been more time and less obstacles in the path of a rescuer. Fate can be so cruel; money so plague-like in its sickly contagion.",1478390400,,733,4.638461538461539
8730790,4,B014HSJ66Y,Loved the movie but there was a portion of the cd that was stuck.  I don't know if it just needs cleaning or if it is defective.,1477353600,,128,3.740740740740741
8730791,4,B014HSJ66Y,Fabulous.  Compared to the Hollywood version this was visually beautifully and wonderfully rich in story and acting.,1473638400,,116,5.823529411764706
8730792,4,B014HSJ66Y,If you like opera you will probably like this. It proceeded and is  better than the current Meryl Streep movie on Florence Foster Jenkins because it is less campy and more complex. Highly recommended.,1473465600,2,200,4.882352941176471
8730793,5,B014HSJ66Y,"Imagine a cat wailing during a heated moment and you have a vague idea of why I was also torn between crying (out of sympathy for a suffering creature) and laughing on first hearing this fairly accurate Marguerite version of Florence Jenkins. It is said she couldn't or wouldn't hear herself. Again for both, performances were for an invitation group of selected acquaintances, and, yes, she was eventually wealthy. Thus, not surprising the story contains people with greed motives. The husband portrayed, although shaky in commitment, was better than FJ's actual first husband. FJ and Marguerite next day paper reviews had a similar range from nasty to ambiguous politeness. Both FJ and Marguerite had a final performance open to all in a large venue. The next day's reviews - not good, for which both suffered consequences as a result (watch the movie). It would have been nice to have a mention in Special Features as to what parts of this story were somewhat supported or substantiated as to Florence Jenkins own history that we can take from this film's interpretation. In summary, the story accurately illustrates the cliche, ""So bad she's good.""",1473033600,,1152,5.005208333333333
8730794,2,B014HSJ66Y,"I seem to be in the minority in not liking this movie. I watched it after seeing ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" in the theater. I am familiar with the recordings of Mme. Jenkins and some of her story. I was forewarned that ""Marguerite"" was completely different in tone. It's not that I don't like foreign films or films that develop slowly. But I need to like somebody among the characters. I found everyone in this story, with perhaps one exception, very unlikable. Marguerite is portrayed as oblivious to her lack of talent and to the people around her. Her philandering husband shows her the merest shred of attention. Her manservant seems to be her sole support. A young singer with a beautiful voice gets a little encouragement but seems to be a very peripheral part of the story. I kept watching with the hopes that someone would rise above the pervasive misanthropy. Alas, no.",1472947200,3,878,4.745098039215686
