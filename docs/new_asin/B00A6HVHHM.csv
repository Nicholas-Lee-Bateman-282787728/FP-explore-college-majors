8546986,5,B00A6HVHHM,"I finished watching this gem of a film and was crying. I did fine throughout the production until near the end... well, you have to watch it and see for yourselves. This is a fun, touching, and very human film that allows these precious souls to shine through in an unfiltered and real way that is both heartwarming and disturbing. Heartwarming because these elders are caring, bold, kind and so human. Disturbing because their words and stories are a forceful reminder of our own mortality, of the brevity of life, and of what is lost with the passing of every older person.",1418774400,,575,4.647058823529412
8546987,5,B00A6HVHHM,"An easy, enjoyable film that highlights love of life. Upbeat (for the most part) and will leave you feeling good!",1362441600,,113,4.7
8546988,5,B00A6HVHHM,"Whiskey and Apple Pie inspires us to ask the question, ""how is my life meaningful to others and rewarding to myself?"" with the underlying premise that this is what creates happiness.  The message, delivered by a plethora of elders across America, lifts the anxiety that often comes with this question.  If folks in their 80's and 90's see life as the journey to this point, then we all still have time to get there.  I for one watched the film overcome by great hope, a wash of relief, and a glint of the happiness to come.  In a world where we think we've done and seen it all, it's nice to be reminded that there's a lot more left to discover.",1359331200,2,645,4.305785123966942
8546989,5,B00A6HVHHM,"I was captivated while watching ""Whiskey and Apple Pie"".  Being on the leading edge of the ""Boomer"" generation, this film got me thinking about my own legacy. What is the message I would give to the generations younger than I am?  What does my life say to my family, friends, and others?
This film keep me captivated from start to finish.
I would highly recommend this to fellow ""Boomers"" and others.",1357776000,,400,4.619718309859155
8546990,5,B00A6HVHHM,"this Documentary shows what we take for granted from our seniors and how the younger generation can get a lot of it. Our seniors have a lot to offer if we all start listening, they are full of information that most History Books don't have. Also once they are gone the history goes with them and regret what we could have learned.",1357344000,,330,4.338709677419355
8546991,5,B00A6HVHHM,"Two 40-something women set off across the United States to interview older Americans about their lives and their experiences with aging. Whiskey and Apple pie documents these interviews, presenting a funny, endearing, and hope-filled picture of the ingredients to feeling successful, content, and at peace as we age. The interviewees, from celebrities to regular folks from all walks of life, offer insightful wisdom in a manner that is educational, moving, and truly entertaining. This film greatly appealed to me both as a social worker and an adult with aging parents. Truly a gem!",1357257600,2,584,5.290322580645161
8546992,5,B00A6HVHHM,This work is entertaining and fasinatingly informative at the same time. I found it refreshing to watch and listen to the older generation reflect on the values of life and what really matters. The editing is superb and will keep you attentive through the entire performance. Don't miss this one!,1356825600,,296,4.94
