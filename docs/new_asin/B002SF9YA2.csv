8379378,5,B002SF9YA2,"The first of the Looney Tunes holiday specials on its own DVD is Bugs Bunny's Cupid Capers, the Valentine special from 1979! It's a shame it didn't include The Stupid Cupid from 1944 as a bonus short, which the feature program was based upon. However, we do get this rare half-hour Valentine special on its own DVD with 2 bonus shorts never on DVD till this one; Holiday Highlights from 1940 & Past Perfumance from 1954, plus 6 different puzzles! The feature program still has bits and pieces of Looney Tunes shorts that STILL ain't on DVD to this day in 2017, due to the WB running out of dough to restore any more Looney Tunes shorts never on DVD before. You never know when Cupid might hit you with his arrows, even in real life! Happy V-Day, folks!",1485388800,,752,4.41726618705036
8379379,1,B002SF9YA2,Pretty upset that I purchased this dvd and it's only 24 mins long. What a rip off and the run time stated up top says 5 hrs. Should have read the reviews first. SMH!,1470873600,,165,3.8823529411764706
8379380,3,B002SF9YA2,"I did a little DVD shopping in the five-dollar bins at Wal-Mart and picked up a few cartoon DVDs for my four-year-old boy. One was ""Bugs Bunny's Cupid Capers."" I'd never heard of the DVD. It was a mistake to buy it, but totally my fault. First of all, it contained only one 24-minute TV special and two 6-minute cartoons. The total running time was just a little over a half hour. Well, what could I expect for five bucks? True. But, I've had some really good five-dollar DVD cartoon compilations that ran for well over an hour. Okay, but on this one I just didn't know. Well, were the cartoons up to expectations as far as cartoons go. No. They weren't. I didn't find them to be good at all and my little boy had great difficulty maintaining concentration. I mean, he has no trouble at all getting mesmerized by Tom and Jerry cartoons, but these just fell flat. Well, I didn't find them very good either. I don't mean to knock Loony Tunes as we watched a Daffy Duck DVD last week and it had no trouble at all at holding everyone's attention. Let's face it, either for the amount of time or for the amount of content, this is just not a very  good DVD. It was well done, I might add, but that's about it. That's All Folks!

8379381,5,B002SF9YA2,we couldn't find this dvd and was so excited when we found it. the product arrived wrapped in a plastic bag with no bubble wrap. slight dent in cover due to poor packaging.,1360800000,2,172,4.242424242424242
8379382,4,B002SF9YA2,"No reason to complain! You get it for a great low price. The overall TV special isn't that great, but you get some clips of cartoons not yet on DVD, like ""Hare Splitter,"" ""Wild Over You,"" and ""Little Beau Pepe."" There's also two bonus cartoons- ""Past Perfumance"" and ""Holiday Highlights."" I recommend this, especially for those of us who love Pepe, and despise the reluctance to give him a disc of his own.",1296691200,2,406,4.575342465753424
8379383,2,B002SF9YA2,"A real rip-off!!!!!!

Only one (1) 24 minute TV special and two (2) 6 mninute cartoons!!!  That is only 36 minutes on a disc that can hold over 180 minutes!!!

Warner should be ashamed to release such a sparce DVD, and charge as much as they do!

First, a very short TV special that contains only CLIPS of original theatrical cartoons, bridged together by poorly drawn & voiced new animation.

Elmer Fudd is Cupid, since the original voice of Elmer died in the late 1950's WB has never been able to find a suitable replacement, the worst is in this TV special.

CLIPS (and only clips, no complete cartoons) are used from the following cartoons:
Hare Trimed (1953) Bugs Bunny
Grey Hounded Hare (1948) Bugs Bunny
Little Beau Pepe (1952) Pepe Le Pew
Super Snooper (1952) Daffy Duck
Rabbit Romeo (1957) Bugs Bunny
Wild Over You (1953)
Of Rice & Hen (1953) Foghorn Leghorn
Devil May Hare (1953) Bugs & Tasmanian Devil

Two un-restored but complete cartoons are included as a bonus in this SPARCE DVD offering:
Holiday Highlights - from the Golden Age of Looney Tunes Laserdisc Set.
Past Perfumance w/ Pepe Le Pew - also looks like it is mastered from a Laserdisc.

But this is NOT ALL FOLKS!  Two restored DVD collections of cartoons are coming out on April 27th 2010!  Two discs with 15 restored cartoons on each disc!  So unless you want every TV special, hold off for those true Looney Tunes cartoon releases:
