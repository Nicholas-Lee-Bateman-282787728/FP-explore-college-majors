7949559,5,B00005Q31F,My nephew loves Cat in the Hat and The Grinch characters.  They're his two favorite of all the Seuss ones. Thus when I stumbled across this movie I knew it'd be a great gift.  The dvd looks great and arrived promptly.,1422489600,,217,4.2682926829268295
7949560,5,B00005Q31F,"Let me be the first to say that I am 20 years old, I don't have a mental problem or anthing like that and I love Dr. Seuss! I know just about every song to EVERY movie and I do mean EVERY movie. I am more intuned with the classics. I, however, do not like to new Dr. Seuss t.v. show, it doesn't justify the creativity of the original Dr. Seus movies. I would recommend this movie and all other movies from the Original series for children and adults. As I stated before, I am 20 years old and am still watching the movies. It teaches you more about character and every last movie has a moral ending that may teach you about how to correct situations or how to act appropriatley to certain situations in life if you let it. ""You don't have to take my word for it""...but I would highly recommend it.",1342224000,,797,4.148387096774194
7949561,5,B00005Q31F,"This is one of the very few videos that the whole family enjoys. At 30 minutes it's long enough for a pre-bedtime viewing, short enough for the 2 year-old to watch but long enough for the 4-year old to feel satisfied.  The story is fun, the animation is trippy and inventive.  There are a few hidden gems that the grown-ups can chuckle at and the rest is funny for the children.  The dialogue between the Cat and the Grinch is pretty witty and amusing.  This is definitely one that the adults and kids can enjoy at the same time.  I am not driven insane by repeated viewings!",1071014400,8,575,4.336448598130841
7949562,5,B00005Q31F,"I've been looking everywhere for this movie and when I saw it here I decided to buy it.  I watched this when I was a kid and haven't seen it in at least 8 years.  I just got it and I was just as delighted with it as when I was younger.  It's very interesting to see the Grinch and the Cat in the Hat together and the animation easily rivals that of a lot of animation today.  Whether you like the Grinch, the Cat in the Hat, or Dr. Seuss, this is a real gem for any video collection.  And I'll admit, I don't have any kids and I bought this just for myself! ^_^",978480000,4,561,3.8017241379310347
7949563,5,B00005Q31F,"I love this movie, it shows the grinch outside of Christmas and it is equally funny to see the Cat in the Hat again.  I watched this movie growing up and it is Dr. Seuss at his best.  I would recommend this for children of all ages.  It just goes to show that Dr. Seuss isn't just for children, but for anyone with a child's heart for a good time and laughter.",976665600,2,360,3.9722222222222223
