7672660,1,B01C6H8CLS,This has got to be the worse collection of videos ever. For a video that cost almost $100 (70.00) I was expecting something great. Highly and strongly disappointed,1493164800,14,163,4.857142857142857

7672662,5,B01C6H8CLS,"Loved this. My Sony 75-940D 4K/HDR looked Tremendous! I love my Sony and this DVD only proved to me, just how great my Sony TV is.",1489708800,11,130,4.038461538461538
7672663,2,B01C6H8CLS,Very Costly- took over a month to receive--I would not purchase again--only 2 or 3 movies worth watching the others are true 4 K but not worth a second viewing,1489363200,24,159,4.333333333333333
7672664,5,B01C6H8CLS,A reminisce of ' Koyaanisqatsi ' . Great film from the perspective lifestyle .,1488585600,,78,4.642857142857143
7672665,4,B01C6H8CLS,This is a collection of short videos and most of them are interesting and provide nice eye candy.,1486339200,,97,4.444444444444445
7672666,5,B01C6H8CLS,Amazing. It clearly shows capability of 4k video. As other mentioned if there was some narration that would make excellent video. None the less. i am glad that I bought this to test out 4K video using my new TV and my new 4k player. Amazing graphic. Worth every penny. I bought it from German company for less price then the US titled version. No problem playing this and got it cheaper.,1484352000,15,387,4.388888888888889
7672667,5,B01C6H8CLS,Awsome! Beautiful picture!,1483833600,3,26,8.0
7672668,2,B01C6H8CLS,Nice.  But would be better with some narration of what you were watching. And it was a ridiculous price.  Dumb me.seller was a price gouger.,1483401600,5,140,4.56

8752339,3,B01C6H8CLS,"Meh. It has some nice shots in it but not so much so that it's worth the price asked.
The night time city scapes were my favorites. The detail was amazing. Needed more of them.
If I got this for $15, then I would have bumped it up to 4. It's not really something you're going to watch over and over.",1512000000,4,299,3.918032786885246
8752340,1,B01C6H8CLS,"Be refrained from your impulse to buy, for sure you will regret and its not worth for the ridiculous price.  The 16 films are indeed short ones that they are all but in one Disc, no narrations, no themes.  You view plenty of similar shows in YouTube for FREE!  You need to watch BBCs planet Earth Il to know what is an honest 4K product, which is priced only half of this so called BBBest of 4K.  I returned it the same day but were refunded with only half of the price I paid.",1506643200,14,477,4.042553191489362
8752341,3,B01C6H8CLS,Not impressed with quality,1500940800,,26,5.75
8752342,1,B01C6H8CLS,"Folk's, it has good content, but you don't have to spend money for it (Sound is only in Stereo, not Surround). You may find much better and much more content in 4K in YouTube.",1500595200,10,175,4.176470588235294
8752343,5,B01C6H8CLS,"Had a bad experience with this disc; about 10 menu items were missing, pressing on a selection would load for about two seconds, then the disc would take you right back to the menu.  Problems with the disc have more to do with a defective copy, not the content.  This disc was returned.
What I could see of the contents was crystal clear, brilliant colors, detailed all the way into the background, giving it, at times, amazing depth.  Most scences are in fast motion if you don't mind that--there were times I thought the fast motion took away from the experience, most other times the fast motion was interesting, especially segments where there are city streets, cars and everything else zipping around--like the contents of blood vessels moving around the body.
I'm giving credit to the artists (5 stars), way to go, beautiful work, thank you.",1497571200,,847,4.787671232876712
8752344,3,B01C6H8CLS,Didn't work well.  Sent it back.  Don't remember getting refund....,1496620800,,67,5.6
