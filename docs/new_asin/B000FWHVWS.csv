I could write for hours about this volume but I will try to keep it a little shorter than that. First of all, all those guys were Annas dad. I thought so. It was nice to be right. Next, their was even more action than last volume, and thats a lot! Goh being taken over by the Mimetic Beasts was awesome! The heart felt talk between Anna and Mira really moved me. The rabid syndrome reversal by the female characters and hope found in Mira was great. The last episode, was perfect with its mix of comedy and drama which is what I think this series really excelled at. The series really came together at the end and we even got to see Anita! Hahahah! It was great to have Goh and Anna together again for the final battle against the Mimetic Beasts. Seeing the other characters and where they were after the seven year period was cool as well. All of them together fighting as one to FINALLY destroy ALL the Mimetic Beasts was a perfect way to end the series. Only one question I had was never answered: How did Mira end up in the Club Mariner (Maxs robot)? I really hoped they would explain it or show it. No matter, I loved the show anyway and this series is my favorite anime ever. Now if they would only make an OVA or movie about the first war with the Mimetic Beasts!",1171670400,,1382,4.238636363636363
8127488,5,B000FWHVWS,"From the moment I played and watched the first volume, Godannar wasn't going to let me down, I will not say a word about what this volume will bring for those who have waited for it to come, but I will say like I said from my first review of Volume 1 that it really is one of the best robot animes I've seen in a long time, goes up there with GetterRobo/Armagedon, GiantRobo, Vandread, and even Mazinkaiser ~w00t~ so freakin awesome. Dont listen to what people say unless you see it for yourself. ^^ loved it all the way baby 5 stars without a doubt",1158192000,2,549,4.188679245283019
8127489,5,B000FWHVWS,"The preview from the previous volume looked amazing so I had high expectations for the ending episodes of Godannar but was slightly disappointed. The first two episodes had a lot of fighting but it wasn't as much or as great as I expected it to be, although it did have its clever points. Godannar doesn't get a rematch with Blade Gainer. Ken just blows himself up pathetically against a super strong mimetic beast, what a waste of the Blade Gainer!!

The last episode took place 7 and 8 years afterwards and mostly showed what people were doing in the future and explained a lot of the mysteries from earlier. There wasn't a lot of fighting in it, just robots showing off in poses and lots of girls with little clothing on, so it was kind of disappointing. The good thing is that most of the mysteries of Godannar were reasonably well explained, although it is kind of a nutty way for everything to be. There are still mimetic beasts at the end, and they are going to fight the mimetic beasts apparently for all time, which is what I expected to happen. Maybe they should make a Godannar movie or something, that would be cool. It seems like the Godannar ending leaves this as an open possibility, although unfortunately it doesn't seem like it will happen. I personally still think Godannar was the greatest show of any kind I've ever seen, but I think not enough other people agree with me.

I was disappointed that they didn't ever give Godannar a real second season intro. The intro changed again but it's still just clips from the show and is all blurry because of ADVisions lousy job with the second season opening credit overlays.

I was happy that things were explained as well as they were though, and also none of the characters I liked died so that is good too. Actually that's not too surprising because the director I think is giving the viewer exactly what he thinks the viewer wants, that is his philosophy. Hardly anyone died in Godannar there were only multiple fake death scares. The only main people who died were Lou's dad, Max, Moukaku, Rosa, and Ken. No girls died during the present, not even Mira. Girls only came back to life so there were negative girl deaths. I also like what they did with future Lou. I knew she was a bad little girl from the start and I'm happy to see that the show creators had the exact same thoughts in mind. I totally expected her to end up living her life like that, I just didn't think that the show creators would be so cynical as to agree. Haha!

I was also pleased that Lou still looks nice when older. Shizuru and Anna got afflicted with boob disease. The older they get the bigger their boobs grow. Poor Shizuru got as big as Anna's mom, and while Anna is not there yet, given her age she could reach the level of Ekaterina when she gets older. Also it showed Anna's mom when she was very young, and she is smaller than Anna, so that's bad news for her! Also Anna's mom looked way better than Anna. I've never liked Anna, but I don't really care because for me Godannar has always been about the humanoid power-ranger-looking funny fighting robots.

Some mysteries still remain but I guess they can be considered relatively minor. I'd still like a clearer explanation of the battle that caused Mira's death way back. All we ever got to see were bits and fragments and they were never put together cleanly for us. What exactly is Neo-Okusaer's Final Ignition like? Neo-Okusaer is still around afterwards so it couldn't have completely self-destructed. When Goh says ""GGRAAAAGH!"" in the very beginning of Episode 1, why does the exploding light appear from his backside and not his frontside? Did Godannar turn around and go GRAAAGH! in the wrong direction? What about Max? He want GRAAAGH! too then suddenly years later the Club Mariner and Max and Mira are all stuck inside a different Mimetic Beast. What the heck happened? And did the regular unmerged blue Godannar just punch out the ""boss"" mimetic beast by itself afterwards or what?

Where the heck did the Mimetic Beasts come from and why/how do they keep sucking up robots and people? This is only slightly addressed in the final episode, in an uncertain and nutty way. A lot of what is said in the last episode are along the lines of ""We aren't sure why things are this way, we aren't even sure yet what is going on completely, but we've discovered that..."".

How the heck, and why, has Tatsuya Aoi done all the crazy things he has been doing for the past X years? I guess that is why we never saw him until just now, and why Anna's mom never really mentions him. I guess Tatsuya Aoi is just nuts is all I can think of.

Where did Blade Gainer come from? Someone had to make it, and I don't think Ken and Rosa made it in their house basement or garage. Personally I think it was probably the mech from another powerful nation, maybe India, judging from the way Ken, Rosa, and their uniforms look. But then why is Blade Gainer running amok and why is no nation claiming responsibility for it? Exactly how long ago did Rosa die anyway and how long has Ken been running amok? Even Lou runs amok long after Ken is dead. Does India not want its mech back or something? The only thing I can think of is that maybe they are too embarassed to admit the Blade Gainer is theirs. Or maybe it's something complicated that has to do with the mysterious ""Commissioners"" so the show creators decided not to explain it to us.

A LOT of mysteries, or things that had been bugging me, were explained VERY well in this volume though, I'm just nitpicking details in the end. I especially like what they did with Club Mariner. I also laughed cause G-Gunner blew up again. How many times is that thing gonna blow up, it must be the suckiest robot ever!

Anyways, Godannar is over! My top 3 favorite DVDs were definitely Volume 1, then 3, then 6. After that it is hard for me to decide which episodes/DVDs were overall better.",1155772800,4,5920,4.488393686165274
