8100525,5,B000CQEC88,"Excellent long & informative lecture on the subject of structure in the writing of screenplays. Jeff Kitchens is an egaging speaker and he is very calm, clear and professional in conveying his knowledge of the subject matter.

I don't want to give away too much... but needless to say, any writer who doesn't quite understand the need for the basic component parts inherent in classic structure would be well advised to take a look at this DVD.

I don't recall seeing any Q&A on the DVD, probably because the lecture itself takes a couple of hours. Great value for money... you will have to watch it more than once as there is so much information (with example movies) to take in.",1205107200,2,680,4.6115702479338845
