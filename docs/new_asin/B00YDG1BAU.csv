Not bad for an experienced crew leaves room for improvement

For low-budget unexperienced actors this was lessons learned
Look forward to seeing more season actors in the future",1433376000,,199,5.1875
8718180,1,B00YDG1BAU,"for the very few 5 star reviews... those are the friends of James ""hotfeet"" Davis...I know because I too use to be his friend... until I found out about all his lies and scams and he will do just about anything to spread rumors to bring you down to make him look better. his own friends don't seem to realize that it's not about the movie being good or bad... its the fact he lied, stole, cheated, and screwed all the people who came all the way from Michigan and New York... including myself. the movie is downright horrible, in fact the only good scenes were with the guy that ran up a wall... he seemed to be the only legit martial artist. not to mention he was the only one properly ""clearing"" a house where as the director was just rushing in like Rambo not even checking overheads or fatal fronts and dominant corners or anything.... if you are in the military... you know what that means... Jame's Hotfeet Davis does not. I have questioned many time whether he was in the military let alone ""special forces"" when he doesnt even know how to clear a house properly. anyway... the movie was horrible... but despite that... i would still promote the movie if it wasn't for the lies that James ""hotfeet"" Davis said and the things he did. I use to stick up for James.... but there is a line and he has crossed it way too many time... friend or not... i cannot sit back and watch him deceive other young minds. the man needs an intervention.

Here... I will provide a short list of things that James ""HotFeet"" Davis has done to make this movie possible. and btw... he didn't say ""MIGHT""... he CONVINCED everyone that this was Lionsgate and that Lionsgate gave him money already and everything... that isn't a broken promise... its called a lie.

1. He said it WAS a lionsgate and a Maverick film... as you can see... it most certainly was not.
2. he said it was a 1.1 million dollar production... it clearly was not even 10 grand.
3. he said all the actors AND extras would get discount hotel... only 3 people got the discount and the price was almost double what he promised.
4. he said if they came out that he would provide food... he made us pay for our own food... everyday.
5. he said he would pay 35 people... he only paid 3 people (his friends) and it was not even close to the amount he promised.
6. he stole the script... he never wrote the script. i have the original script that he didn't even follow and it has the original author right on the cover.
7. he kept making changes and manipulating actors then just kept blaming the decisions on his Grand Master, Lionsgate, and Maverick... just so he didn't take the blame for his own actions.
8. he spread.. MANY rumors about all of the actors... even his so called ""friends"". and these rumors were big and clearly lies. for instance... one of the actresses were mad at a rumor that had spread... i heard James start this rumor with his own lips... yet when confronted, I witnessed him pin the blame on one of the other actors who hasn't done anything wrong and started a bunch of drama just to save his butt.
9. he said Westely Snipes was going to be in this film... he was not.
10. he promised this was a global production that will be released by Maverick on Netflix and local stores around the world... its only on amazon.
11. he said he had a red Carpet premier already lined up... he did not
12. he said the movie won a big award at the Urban Action Showcase... it didn't come close to winning anything.
13. he said the camera guys were the same team that filmed the ""Blade"" trilogy... they said themselves that they ""only did weddings and stuff""
14. he said the makeup artist worked on the new Dawn of the Dead remake... she herself said she never worked on anything like that.
15. he said he had over 1.1 mil invested into this film of his own money... then said $600,000... then only $400,000... and kept changing the price.
16. he was very VERY rude and unprofessional and even sexual with most of the actors and actresses... even sexually harassing one of the actresses then later spreading rumors about her when she wouldn't... ""give in""
17. he claims to be a minister yet knows not a single bible verse or scripture. let alone he had a fowl mouth in front of all the kids... like really fowl.
18. he ""misplaced"" his LOADED firearm many time... when there were young kids running around.
19. the very friends of his that are defending him.. don't realize that one of the actors has RECORDINGS of him trash talking them behind their back as well.
20. he said people voted this movie was better than any Jason Stathom movie... lol... i just laugh at that
21. he said Tony Ja wanted to be in this film but he ""turned him down"" ... another one i have to laugh at.
22. he said Lionsgate already gave him the money to do 7 movies... now he denies he ever said that despite the clear recordings of him saying that. which were provided by an actor who caught on to his scam.
23. he discredited and fired the camera crew because ""they were moving too slow"" when in fact it was his fault.
24. he did not... i repeat... he did not choreograph a single fight scene... he did however butcher other peoples fight scene to make him look better.
25. he claimed that he paid $1500 to ""reserve a section.... at Denny's...  yes... i said Denny's... $1500... let that sink in.

this list could go on and on and on... and I'm sure other people have more to add to it. this isn't about the movie being good or bad... its about a crook stealing, manipulating, and lying to get honest people to do his will.

last but not least... if all these actors who were a part of this project leaving bad reviews wasn't enough proof that James ""HotFeet"" Davis is a fraud... one of the actors from Michigan, who I will not name to protect him, actually recorded phone conversations with James during and after the filming... each recording has clear proof and solid evidence of all these lies and more.

and the best part is... that all the friends of James giving this 5 star reviews... don't realize that James has talked a ton of trash behind their back... and its all recorded lol",1433376000,,6121,4.3790677220756375
