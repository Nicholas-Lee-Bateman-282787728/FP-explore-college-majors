8574716,5,B00BWD13WS,"This is another great firm workout. It is efficient, fun, and very low impact. It is mostly a step workout video but the step can be as high or low as you need it to be. I use a very low step even for the tall box exercises because I have very bad knees and I still get a great workout. It's not an overly long program either so it is good to use on days you don't have a lot of time.",1446336000,,384,3.63855421686747
8574717,3,B00BWD13WS,"I was glad to see a new classic firm but it's edited so poorly that I found myself rushing around to
grab weights or switch to the tall box when in the actual workouts this is compiled from they gave
you at least 5 seconds to get or switch to what you  needed so this is a 3 star review because of that.",1416873600,2,303,3.8095238095238093
