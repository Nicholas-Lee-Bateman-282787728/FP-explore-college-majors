8382467,4,B002VRNJDU,"This movie / documentary was pretty good. It really delves into the annals of the fashion industry. It tells the truth. Some people who don't like this movie, obviously don't know much about the fashion industry beyond the glitz, glamour and celebrities. This is showing you what you go through before the fashion show. You are literally working on pieces or something right up to before they walk out.
Personally, I think only a new designer or just someone in the fashion industry can really appreciate this. And, if you're wise there are a lot of lessons to be learned from this documentary; many things you can possibly avoid that can keep your stress level down just a tad bit.
I'm not a fan of a lot of profanity, I just don't like cussing...but because this (fashion) is what I do and love, I found this an educationally, yet enjoyable, cautionary tale.",1522281600,,860,4.6644736842105265
8382468,1,B002VRNJDU,"why do a film on a designer that was a flash in the pan? what has he done since Project Runway? Nothing.
A total bore",1506643200,,117,3.72
8382469,3,B002VRNJDU,This movie was ok.  It made me angry to learn that the Humane Society is spending it's donations funding fashion shows...I will not be giving donations to this organization again.,1457568000,,179,4.966666666666667

8382471,4,B002VRNJDU,"This documentary examines Jay McCarroll's attempt at runway fashion after his win of Project Runway season one.

The endeavor is stressful because it is filled with complications, from shoe designers who come through at the very last minute to disgruntled employees who expect payment for their services to the complexities of the business side of fashion. Jay swears his way through the film, trying to interject humor into heavy situations and trying to find his vision in the midst of what is expected of him as a newly emerged celebrity.

You will see the messy side of the industry. This is not a polished reality show. Instead, it is a realistic portrayal of the gears and guts of fashion and what it takes for a measley eleven minutes of glory.

If you love fashion, this documentary will be a real treat. If you simply like the formula of reality television, you will most likely find Eleven Minutes to be lacking.",1271203200,3,922,4.75
8382472,5,B002VRNJDU,"Having been a Jay fan from day One, I spent weeks hunting down this DVD locally so I could see Jay in action. Turns out, Jay isn't the only fascinating thing about fashion - it's a hot mess! We on the outside have the illusion that the designer draws something, and 2 days later a skinny kid wears it on the catwalk - not so. The sheer number of hands, people, and egos that come into play are astounding, and it's now amazing to me that anything gets done at all.
I still love Jay, even if he is stubborn and immature.",1270080000,3,519,4.098039215686274
8382473,5,B002VRNJDU,"I'm one of the people that couldn't wait to see what project runway season one winner was doing now and to find out where he was in the world.  As always I love his style, character and fabric choices this a good follow up dvd that showcases the designer and the ups and downs of the behind the scenes fashion world.",1269734400,2,316,4.180327868852459
8382474,3,B002VRNJDU,"I am a fan of Jay McCarroll after watching season 1 of Project Runway. Ever since I heard about Eleven Minutes I was checking every few months to see if it would come out on DVD. A couple years later, here it is.

It's basically a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to build a collection and get it into a major fashion show. There's a lot that goes into it that you don't really think about. Some of it is quite interesting and gave me a greater appreciation for what it really takes to put together a show and get clothes made.

The reality of the situation is that Jay is/was a new designer that was just released into the wild with huge expectations due to his win on Project Runway. He seems broke (can't pay his staff), and hasn't mastered all of the logistics around putting a show together and having clothes made. All of these things ball up together and create a lot of pressure for Jay. Anyone in that position would be pretty uncomfortable. That uncomfortable feeling is present throughout most of the documentary and makes it drag at times. It wasn't so much of Jay's clever and funny personality (which we do still see quite a bit) as it was the reality of how crappy his situation was.

It's worth seeing once, especially for those interested in the world of fashion and for fans of Jay, but I just didn't get the feeling like I'm going to want to watch it again. Jay is 5 stars, his collection shown on the documentary is 5 stars, but the documentary itself is just a solid 3 stars. Not bad, not great.",1267228800,12,1523,4.355633802816901
