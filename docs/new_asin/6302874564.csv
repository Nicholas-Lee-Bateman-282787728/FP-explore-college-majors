522259,5,6302874564,"Do you think is it possible to inspire in Bogart films to make such decision as become a private eye?

This sharp and very clever film begins with this premise and develops an original story that will delight you to the end. Deeply rooted in the true origins of the British humor; dark, sinister, elegant, cynical and stylized.

Wonderful entertainment for Finney buffs and far beyond. A film that turned my personal attention for this young promise: Stephen Frears.",1121472000,,466,4.886075949367089
522260,5,6302874564,"I've followed most of Finney's films from the beginning, as I always find him amusing and his eye for unusual roles and interesting scripts has kept me keen. Add in the directing skills of Stephen Frears and some good English character actors and you're bound to have a good time.
I've always paired this one with ""Wolfen"", made about a decade later, in which he also plays a detective. While that one was a supernatural thriller set in New York with dizzy editing effects and great location sets, this one is a grittier and more whimsical take on 1940s' detective/crime thrillers, set in Liverpool.
Finney's character here is a keen observer, film buff and and fantasiser, and is responsible for some wonderful punning dialogue, perhaps a trait that was of its time and better suited to novels, but in Finney's hands it comes off.
It's a film not for mainstream tastes, perhaps, as it's decidedly quirky, and no doubt why a number of critics didn't enthuse about the film. But for wit in the script, acting and direction this one is from the top drawer. Definitely overdue for DVD release.",1069891200,4,1090,4.742105263157895
522261,4,6302874564,"I have to confess that I've never seen the video of this.  I saw this movie at the University of Iowa when I attended there in the '70s but I did like it.
The show is essentially a parody of Bogart movies.  I thought one of the best scenes was the one on the bus when he shakes the envelope.  Nice.
This is the only movie with Albert Finney that I really liked.",995328000,,361,3.9178082191780823

522383,5,6302874564,"In my opinion, its Finney's best movie after 'Tom Johns'. An unusual film noir parody with 'The Maltese Falcon' story line.  The genre's cliches are a delight.  A classic line goes like this: 'A gun, a buck and a broad, that's the kind of world that I live in'.  This movie is a must see for noir lovers.  Despite th British locals and culture, its could rival 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid'.",1296604800,,389,4.361111111111111
522384,5,6302874564,"""Gumshoe"" is a rare bird indeed.  A homage to old-style detective films that could also serve as parody.  Fledgling director Stephen Frears neatly walks that tightrope and comes out with flying colors.  The film is funny but at the same time respectful of detective convention notably the work of Dashiell Hammett particularly ""The Maltese Falcon"".  It helps that your star, Albert Finney, is at the top of his game here as a stand-up comic turned accidental private eye.  This isn't a buyer beware because the product description on the DVD says the film is in color.  It's in black and white and gloriously so.",1252022400,2,612,4.836538461538462
522385,5,6302874564,"This is a gem; worthy of cult status.
But is my memory deceiving me or is there a bit missing -at least on the dvd version. I could swear there was a substantial segment of the movie where Eddie is calling a bingo game that evolves into a confrontation with his brother. In this verbal altercation Eddie identifies with those bingo players as opposed to those who can ""compete"", such as his brother. A telling scene that foreshadows the more recent scandals of CEO corruption and lost worker's pensions. Is this just a telling coincidence or a willful omission? If restored, it would add a shine to this gem.",1245369600,,608,4.587155963302752
522386,4,6302874564,"I am still trying to figure out what makes a film a ""Martini Movie,"" but this is the best one in the series so far. An alarmingly young Albert Finney plays a bored Liverpuddlian would-be comedian who places an advertisement promoting himself as a private eye and gets more than he bargained for. This early Stephen Frears film is both a sendup and a celebration of pulp private-eye film noir, tight, crisp, clever without being precious, darkly comic, and downright scary when it needs to be. Finney bounces off the always electric Frank Finlay as his shipping magnate brother, as well as at least two delicious femmes fatales in the most welcome persons of Billie Whitelaw and Janice Rule. The witty soundtrack score is by some hungry young dude named Andrew Lloyd Weber.",1239494400,4,772,4.81203007518797
522387,2,6302874564,"I've read reviews of this film that praised it, that discussed it as a cult classic. For me it only fell into that category by being a misguided film that made little sense and felt more hodge podge than most films. In essence, a movie that offered little entertainment but plenty of ""what's going on here?""

Albert Finney plays Eddie Ginley, a bingo caller and wanna be comedian at a local club.
Bored and a fan of tough P.I. novels, Eddie has placed an ad in the local classifieds on a lark. Claiming to be a private detective, he waits for a phone call to the ad.

On his birthday he gets that call, directing him to a hotel where a mysterious man provides him with a package. Inside are a picture of a girl with information about her, 1000 pounds (it's a British film kids) and a gun.

Thinking this is some joke his brother has plaid on him, Eddie goes to visit. Eddie and his brother William (Frank Finley) don't get along and never have. The fact that William married Eddie's girl Ellen (Billie Whitelaw) didn't help matters. Now Ellen is in an unloving marriage and the brothers still quarrel. At this meeting, Eddie finds out that the set up didn't come from William at all.

Looking into the matter, Eddie finds no leads at the hotel he went to. Finding the girl results in a late night visit from a friend of hers who demonstrates for Eddie the power of a gut punch. And another player gets involved trying to confiscate the money from Eddie who at the moment is unwilling to part with it.

Another talk between brothers results in Eddie knowing on the sly that his brother isn't the import/export person he claims to be. Garden tools headed to Africa have little to do with growing crops and Eddie knows it but lets it slide. With no help at this end, he goes about his life and keeps searching for the truth.

Given the chance to do his comedy act at the club, he comes offstage having done well only to be told by his boss to take a vacation. It seems someone called to tell him not to employ Eddie. All this does is increase his efforts to get to the bottom of things.

And that's where the whole problem lies with this film. Each clue doesn't feel like it's really a clue at all. The film feels like a bunch of mismatched pieces tossed about with the hopes that the end story results in a great mystery solved. But a great mystery involves the viewer with clues that can be followed and leads that link to other portions of the film. Here, we have that mismatched odds and ends feel.

Worse yet, they all seem to come from a group of characters who have little life in them at all. No one seems to take the whole mystery aspect of it seriously. No one gets upset or angry and if they do they're so reserved about it you have to watch their nostrils to see if they're breathing or not.

The wordplay between characters is fast and furious at times and that offers a little distraction. But as I watched I never felt engrossed enough to care about the results. And the end results didn't feel satisfying at all. The summation, always in a mystery, didn't feel like it was put together well enough that you could have garnered the end in advance. Sure, it all made sense, but a great mystery should offer us the chance to figure things out as we watch, not wait for the hero's summation.

If you believe a cult film is something that's different for the sake of being different, you might like this one. If you think British films are a form unto themselves, well maybe that as well. But if you want a mystery that keeps your interest this one isn't it.

Released as part of the Martini Movie series of films from Sony, the extras are small consisting of the preview for the film and two Martini Minutes. Great if you need a recipe for a drink, bad if you're looking for a good mystery.",1236988800,3,3799,4.329113924050633
522388,4,6302874564,"A lovable Liverpudlian loser plays at Philip Marlowe in this English re-examination of the private detective genre similar to those that flourished stateside in the early 70s. This one though is like a cross between Billy Liar and The Big Sleep and manages to be both amusing and yet offers some believable tension to the story's hardboiled moments.  It's not a classic like The Long Goodbye or Night Moves, but it beats dreck like Peeper.  And director Stephen Frears pours on the local color.  The no-frills DVD looks good, and really accentuates the flavor of the colorful scenes set in the seedy nightclub that Finney works in. These moments are terrific and this may be Finney's most charming performance.

If there's a downside it's in Finney's casually racist remarks about the lone African character, which may be accurate to our hero's world view, but they're a bit jarring and temper our endearment towards the character.

Andrew LLyod Weber scored and you may recognize the main theme was recycled as the title song from Sunset Boulevard.  (The dynamic between the hero and his brother and the brother's wife also echoes the later film The January Man.)",1234569600,3,1164,4.943589743589744
522389,5,6302874564,"I am so pleased this long neglected film is finally being released on DVD! I have owned the VHS version for almost 20 years, and have worried the tape would degrade before it would become available on DVD. I re-watched my VHS of Gumshoe recently. Though it's been a few years since I had viewed it, it remains my favorite movie of both Albert Finney and Stephen Frears. To enjoy it you have to realize it is pastiche, a tongue in cheek tribute to those old film noir detective films of the 1940s. It is fun and interesting to watch from that aspect. The musical score is hysterical and the dialogue is fast, sharp, and laced with dry humor. Americans without an attuned ear to English accents may have a little trouble following, but it is worth the effort, even if you have to replay certain scenes.

Though it couldn't have been a challenging performance for an actor of Finney's caliber, he and the entire cast are terrific. If you are a British Cinema film buff, watching this 1972 production today, one almost feels as if you are seeing a piece of motion picture history, with an amazingly talented cast that includes Frank Finlay, Billie Whitelaw and Fulton Mackay. Add to this it was Stephen Frears movie directorial debut and Andrew Lloyd Webber is credited for the music.

Other trivia:
--Gumshoe was a Memorial Enterprises production. This is the production company formed by Finney and Michael Medwin in the 1960s that also produced breakthrough films such as Lindsay Anderson's ""If"" and ""O Lucky Man"" and Mike Leigh's first film, ""Bleak Moments"", and Finney's own masterpiece, ""Charlie Bubbles"".  Medwin is credited as Producer on Gumshoe, as he is on most or all of M.E. productions.
--Finney is a confessed fan of the noir, detective genre and a fan of John Huston who among other classics directed the Maltese Falcon

Gumshoe is a ""must see"" for any fan of British Film, Stephen Frears or Albert Finney. It would also be enjoyable to fans of film noir detective movies, as well as anyone who appreciates good pastiche.",1230681600,18,2033,4.734463276836158
522390,3,6302874564,"Mark Twain once said something along these lines about women swearing: ""They've got the words, but the tune isn't quite right.""  I shall distance myself from the subject of Twain on women (run away from it like a thief, as a matter of fact), but turn the observation to the English and their understanding of American hard-boiled detective stories.  They've got the words, but the tune isn't quite right.

They certainly have an ear for the patter.  (Dashiell Hammett: ""The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter."")  A British critic once defined the American mystery as the literature of the extraordinary comparisons.  They hear the wisecracks--or ""cracking wise"" as Hammett would have it.  (Raymond Chandler: ""I don't like your manners.""  ""Neither do I, I grieve for them.)  But they too often respond to them as a surface phenomenon, a mere style, rather than underlying nature.

And so it is here.  In this 1971 movie, Albert Finney plays a 31 year-old slacker (Ross MacDonald might have called him a ""mope"") who has failed to come to terms with the realities and responsibilities of the adult world.  He retreats into his Sam Spade fantasy life by putting an ad (or advert as they'd say over there) in a newspaper, describing himself as a private detective.

Since this is a movie, the ad gets immediate results.  A mysterious commission arrives, leading the slacker to indulge in little soliloquies that almost, if not quite, serve as the voice-overs in canonical hard-boiled films.  Laconic directions bring him to a meeting with a fat man in a hotel suite.  (Hee-hee, you can almost hear the screenwriter giggling, just like Sam Spade and Casper Gutman, get it?  Get it?  We get it.)  Needless to say, there is a rich and willowy dame, a discontented wife, a fast with his fists bodyguard, a guy who thinks he's in the know but finds out the hard way that he isn't, a shadowy big shot pushes around a little guy who just wants to make a living, a respectable public figure who isn't, a couple of tough guys who barge into the slacker's flat-cum-office with malice intended, betrayals, assorted felonies and sudden death.  In short, a routine day at the office for hard-boiled Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe or Lew Archer, something demanding his undivided attention as soon as he finishes polishing his shoes or getting a haircut.

The plot structure, in general outline, is strictly canonical.  They've got the words down pat.

But the tune isn't quite right.  A woman Finney's slacker character might love turns out to be a fine, noir-ish spider-woman.  Instead of a grand renunciation scene (D. Hammett: ""I'm going to send you over.  The chances are you'll get off with life.  That means you'll be out again in twenty years.  You're an angel.  I'll wait for you.""  He cleared his throat.  ""If they hang you, I'll always remember you.""), Finney hardly even shrugs his shoulders.

In the end, when Finney has traversed his mean streets and emerged triumphant, does he savor the victory (if you give him the benefit of a doubt or gloat over it if you don't) in a typically (North) American way--take advantage of it, build on it, become the man he has proved himself to be?  Heck, no.  He's English.  He was born to be a slacker.  That's his nature, his class, his station in life.  A slacker he was born, a slacker he is, a slacker he shall be.

The movie has other problems.  The outline of the plot is classical hard-boiled.  The details of the plot can only be described as slapdash.  Any watcher of ""Gumshoe"" must carefully avoid asking why things are happening.  Once the question is asked, the whole thing falls into a meaningless, unmotivated heap.  To some extent, that is also true of such classics as ""The Big Sleep,"" but there, everything is so wound up and moving so fast that you hardly even notice it.  The casting is odd.  Finney was 34 or 35 when the film was shot, but he looks like a hard-driven and dissipated fifty or more, far too old for the 31 year-old slacker, who behaves more like a callow 20 year-old.  Finney is supposed to be fearful of one tough guy who shadows him.  But Finney looks like a light heavyweight and the supposed tough guy looks like a superannuated lightweight.  It just doesn't work.  The designated spider-women of the cast throw off remarkably little erotic charge or heat, They are completely overshadowed in that aspect during a short scene featuring the actress would later play Miss Brahms in the old ""Are You Being Served?"" TV series.

This is not a bad movie.  It is simply not a very good movie.

Three stars.",1186272000,,4574,4.703656998738966
522391,5,6302874564,"Here's a terrific little film that's never gotten its proper due. Yes, it works wonderfully as a comedy, filled with funny & fascinating characters, as well as being an affectionate parody of classic Bogart detective films. But there's more to it than that ...

Albert Finney provides us with a compelling, funny, yet sometimes sad study of Eddie Ginley, a man reluctant to grow up, reluctant to let go of the dreams & fantasies of childhood. The comparison with his older, more realistic, businessman brother couldn't be sharper -- especially when we learn that his brother wound up marrying Eddie's girlfriend, because Eddie wasn't quite prepared for marriage & all that it entails.

It's telling & deeply moving, for instance, when in the midst of solving the real-life mystery which has enveloped him, Eddie runs into an old friend. The two stop to converse & catch up, reminiscing about favorite rock 'n' roll songs, teenage exploits ... and almost in passing, the friend reveals that he's married & has children. Eddie is both touched & a little lost. There's a pervading sense of, ""Where did the past go?""

Yet Eddie isn't a loser. If he's let fantasy enrich his life at the expense of some maturity, he hasn't succumbed to the banality & corruption of ""realistic"" life, as represented by his older brother. And if the world isn't as neatly black & white as a classic detective film, there's still a difference between right & wrong, however wide the gray area between them.

By the time we get to the end of the story, and the mystery has been resolved, Eddie's definitely matured ... yet without entirely losing the richness of his fantasy life. He's simply learned how to take those ideals portrayed so clearly in his cherished detective films & carry them into the everyday world. Eddie's story ends on an elegaic tone, which has been building throughout the film, but he's ready to negotiate the adult world on his own terms now. He's not only solved the mysteries of the film, he's started to solve the mystery of living.

So, when is this superb early film by director Stephen Frears going to be released on DVD?

I must admit I bought it primarily for the scenes of Liverpool, in the 1960s. Being an expat and former Liverpudlian, it brought a smile when the film went to some very familiar places. I remember very well the grimy buildings (as a result of the heavy use of coal fires in homes and industry) at the Pier Head and what a shock it was on a later trip to see those same building glistening white after a thorough cleaning.
