8270968,5,B0000ALFA2,"When I first found WARRIOR WELLNESS a couple of years ago I was pretty much a wreck.  After 3 decades of hardcore (read that improper) training in martial arts and free weights my joints were in almost constant pain.  I was 45 with the joints of a 90 year old and had been trying everything looking for relief but finding little.  Enter Scott Sonnon and WARRIOR WELLNESS.  I started training with tape one and did so daily.  As the weeks went by I could gradually feel the pain easing and greater capability of movement returning.  This comes as no great surprise as Coach Sonnon has proven himself to be one of the great training geniuses of our time.
WARRIOR WELLNESS presents simple movements that graduate in their degree of difficulty but only as your ability to perform increases.  I believe that this program would be a great benefit to all ages as it does not require one to be an acrobat or in great shape to begin with.  By simply performing along with the tapes your ease of movement will begin to return to levels long forgotten.  I highly recommend giving this a prolonged try and believe in it whole-heartedly.",1062979200,6,1124,4.58
8270969,5,B0000ALFA2,"I highly recommend this video to anyone who would like to become healthier and more mobile.  Why do I recommend this set of tapes - because they work.
I watched all three tapes (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) and began working on the beginner tape and over the past week have done the program and the results are very good.  I do have more energy during the day, my joints are in the process of increasing the ROM (range of motion) and I am finding out my body/balance is more stable.  Also, I am finding out that I have a long way to go before I can do the advanced tape effectively.
Coach Sonnon's tape are very instructive and easy to follow and the excercises are such that anyone can do them and gain the benefits of them.  I highly recommend these tapes to anyone.  I for one will be doing the tapes and as I progress I will be able to obtain the elusive goal of being - truly healthy - joints that are stronger, more ROM (range of motion), a more stable and balanced body and stronger core muscles (legs, hips, back and chest).
Also, this is the first review that I have felt like writing for any excercise methodology.",1061942400,6,1132,4.345971563981043
8270970,5,B0000ALFA2,"In the mid '80's I was in a car accident that left me with 2 bulging discs in my neck, and 2 herniated discs in my lower back.
I went through 5 years of physical therapy with very little results. I finally found a good chiropractor and after a month of adjustments was able to move about without much pain.
The problem was that after feeling good for a short while, the pain would always return, causing more trips to the chiro. and more money.
I got involved in the martial arts for the health, stretching and self defense, hoping that it would help keep my back/neck strong and flexible. It helped, but caused alot of trauma too.
Around 2001 I came across Coach Sonnon's website and was curious about the ""joint strength"" program mentioned with reguard to the WW tapes. I liked the idea of using my bodyweight for resistance instead of needing a gym membership or the latest gadget.
I ordered the tapes and immiadiatley jumped to tape #3.
That was a very stupid thing to do, as it is a progressive series and needs to be gone through in order.
The exercises were things I've never seen before. Anyone can do them. The tapes are very easy to understand and the exercises can be done anywhere. They develop a greater range of motion, coordination, and ""looseness"" in your body that I hadn't felt in quite a few years. They hit every joint in your body, including the hands and feet. The way Coach Sonnon takes you through the exercises gets you stretched as well. That is a great thing because I HATE stretching, but you almost don't even realize it is happening while you follow along.
Don't let the title fool you. You don't have to be an athlete or martial artist to enjoy the benefits of this series. Some of my best friends are world class couch potatos and they are reaping the benefits of Coach Sonnon's work.
My back and neck haven't felt this loose in a long time. Using this tape series has made a HUGE difference in my life.
I haven't been back to the chiro. since beginning the tapes 2 years ago.
I hope that helps.",1059177600,6,2027,4.422459893048129
8270971,5,B0000ALFA2,"I have bought the separate beginner level, then intermediate level of the Warrior Wellness tape series, as well as other
books, tapes by Scott Sonnon, and have nothing but praise
for this man's programs and instruction.
Warrior Wellness programs are well instructed and deceptively
easy to do at one's particular level, although unique in scope
and far-reaching in benefit. I found myself looking forward to
this as my 20 min morning routine wake-up. It's actually fun,
especially the intermediate program, and I have regained movement
and strength in my shoulders (injuries!) particularly.
I have to say that I feel my spine and neck being moved agreeably
in ways that even years of yoga have not achieved. The smooth flowing manner of movement is pleasurable and I find my body
craving it- buzzing and tingling back to life. Scott's genuine and amusing style of delivery is eye-opening, from the heart and very motivating.
As he says- ""move it or lose it folks""!
Highly recommended!!",1059091200,4,985,5.049079754601227
8270972,5,B0000ALFA2,"This video series contains easy to follow, but extremely effective exercises. A person only needs to follow one time through the video to feel an extrodinary difference in their energy levels and general movement. This is a must buy for anyone that participates in athletic competition, or someone that is interested in improving their quality of life. A great series that is not only informative, but fun to improve upon.",1059004800,2,422,5.042857142857143
