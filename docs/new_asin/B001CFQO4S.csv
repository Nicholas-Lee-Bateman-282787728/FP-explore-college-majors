She is very happy to get the two Vol. I got her.
Now if I can just get her to let me watch them....",1453593600,,114,3.107142857142857
8287526,5,B001CFQO4S,This a wonderful DVD. It just happens that the person I bought it from was selling the Limited Edition Two Disc case which was awesome. I was expecting just the one dvd case so I was happily surprised by that. The series is a must see.,1375920000,,235,4.130434782608695
8287527,5,B001CFQO4S,"As much as I would love to be able to buy the original Japanese release, I have to live in the real world and except it's not going to happen.  Despite all the things people like to complain about when questioned about english re-releases like this one, I adore it.  Why?  Simple really.  It's CHEAP when compared to the original(thank you failing economy and rising echange rates)and if I don't feel like reading while watching tv, I just turn to the dubbed version(the voice actors actually do the anime justice) and voila.  Sure, you don't get all the nifty extras, but you also don't need to reconfigure your DVD player to make it playable.  The only draw back is having to wait for the newest releases to get dubbed.",1306454400,,721,4.550387596899225

*Excellent video/sound quality.
*This version of ""Hellsing"" has excellent imagery and graphics.  It includes a lot of computer-generated-imagery, but none of it looks too hoaky or out-of-place.  It is definately high quality animation.
*Excellent amount of bloody action.  Includes a few comical moments.
*Storyline is great.  It is very very close to the original manga.
*Characters are splendid.  All of the main characters are still great.  Alucard is probably the most psychotic in this volume so far.  The final bad guy is fun to watch.
*Some good lines throughout.
*Funky music (although I think the music in the old ""Hellsing"" show was better).

The Bad Things
*Not for the squeamish; contains lots of bloody violence and swearing (rated TV-MA).
*A lot of stuff is packed into a single hour.  As fast and condensed as everything is, it may be seen as overly compressed with not enough exposition.

The Other Things
*If you buy the single-disc version, you get little or no special features.  The two-disc steelbook edition (although more expensive) includes a small wealth of interviews and textless credit scenes.

This third volume is generally not bad, and still boasts some very excellent action and fighting.  It is actually a lot more psychotic than before.  It is very exciting and is a good episode in the ""Ultimate"" series.",1224547200,,1355,5.072398190045249
