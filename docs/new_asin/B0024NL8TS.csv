8350709,3,B0024NL8TS,"I saw Dennis Adams on YouTube, liked his easy style and searched Amazon to see if he had any books or DVDs out. I found this little video available to rent for the princely sum of $2 on Amazon instant video. It's dated and there are newer and more effective techniques out there, but some may still find these few simple techniques useful. Adams has the viewer ""stripping"" excess energy from their bodies kind of like using your hands in a squeegee like manner. He claims that in tests when they measured people after they lost actual physical weight off their bodies. He also offers a few simple meditation techniques, one using your breaths and one is a 7 color meditation. I thought he might use the chakra colors and some colors relate to the chakras, but the last color is gold so Adams is using his own color scheme that appears to be partially based on the chakras. The video starts off a bit slow and I would have liked more explanation and information especially since on one of the YouTube videos it was said Adams was being studied at a hospital. Adams has a genial personality. The best part of the video for me was when he leads the viewer through the color meditation as he was so encouraging and it was restful. I wouldn't say it was worth paying for a permanent download, but if you want to learn a simple and relaxing simple color meditation and a few other tips the $2 is probably fine.",1319500800,,1404,4.424710424710424
8350710,5,B0024NL8TS,"I had read the reviews on this DVD. I read a couple of them that stated that this DVD was amateur to say the least. I also noted that the review was written by a Reike healer. Of course to a professional healer, this may look amateur... however, I thought the DVD was very adequate for someone who is just interested in learning a few healing techniques. I happen to like this DVD... it made a whole lot of sense to me and I have been using it along with other family members. I think it is a good DVD. The price was good and it was delivered on time. I don't think you will be disappointed in it if you are thinking about ordering it... go for it!",1259539200,4,648,4.0310077519379846
8350711,1,B0024NL8TS,"A very boring, and amateur presentation. Where does the title 'WESTERN MASTER'come from?? I'm sorry but i must be honest. I have been teaching the  energetics of healing for 25 years now and watching this D.V.D. has made me realize how far advanced i am in thefield of mental, emotional, and spiritual healing.
