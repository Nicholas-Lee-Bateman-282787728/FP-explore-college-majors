8488636,4,B005XH3688,"Synopsis: An aspiring female journalist in Victorian era England investigates the Jack the Ripper slayings. Alas! The closer she gets to solving the mystery, the more she begins to suspect that her charming suitor could be behind the crimes.
My thoughts: Seemingly cheesy, but actually pretty entertaining. 'Love Lies Bleeding' was panned by the two critics I could find, but the youtube trailer made it look like so much fun! The first of two Jack the Ripper films featuring fabulous Welsh character actor Paul Rhys, it was not any worse than 'From Hell'.
