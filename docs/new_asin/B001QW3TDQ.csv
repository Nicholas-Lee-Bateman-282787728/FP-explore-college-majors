8336641,5,B001QW3TDQ,"I bought all 4 together because of the great price, and gave away the 2 that I already had.  They say that laughing is good for our health.  In that case, my life span has probably increased a couple of years from watching these.  So much fun!",1354060800,,243,4.127659574468085
8336642,5,B001QW3TDQ,"Well this is the funniest thign ive seen in a while. Whether its the dry sense of humer idk, but its great to have around.",1319846400,,122,3.92
8336643,3,B001QW3TDQ,"I wish I'd understood before I purchased this set that it didn't contain ALL the episodes from seasons 1-4. I truly thought it did. After viewing them all, I realized many episodes appear to be missing, and the full set of episodes can only be bought, apparently, through The Discovery Channel's Store at a much higher price. This is a great set for the money, but I was seeking a FULL SET OF ALL EPISODES as I lived without cable TV for several years and missed many episodes.  I'll be selling this set, and purchasing the full set of all episodes.  Dirty Jobs and Mike Rowe are worth it. Don't want to miss any episodes.",1284422400,2,622,4.4
8336644,5,B001QW3TDQ,"I love watching Dirty Jobs they are Awsome! and everyone in my family loves to watch also. I could not find these at dicovery's website so buying it here at amazon is the only place that you can find the whole set and for a great price,

sweet deal!",1274054400,,249,4.081632653061225
8336645,5,B001QW3TDQ,"I don't think there is a bettter possible host they could have chosen for this seris. I got my set a few days ago and everything is great! DVD are in great condition and I the picture quality is good. I really would have liked to see a few specific episodes on here but the ones chosen are good. There are a few that I feel they should have not put in these collections due to the fact that there isn't much getting dirty. I mean they are interesting, but some not dirty enough for my taste.",1273708800,,491,4.072164948453608
8336646,5,B001QW3TDQ,"DVDs in perfect condition.  Prompt shipping.  Given as a gift, so cannot comment on how they did when played.",1262822400,,109,4.684210526315789
8336647,4,B001QW3TDQ,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine and she loved it.  It is four different one-disc collections, each in its own case, with each individual collection spanning multiple seasons.  This means that the episodes are not in order of when they aired, or even by season.  I found that this didn't detract from the discs at all, and it doesn't really matter what order you view the episodes in anyway. I was a little surprised with how many episodes were on each disc (and I don't think any of them repeated any episodes), especially considering how inexpensive it was.  All in all, it's a great gift for any Dirty Jobs lover.",1262822400,4,638,4.474137931034483
8336648,5,B001QW3TDQ,Dirty Jobs is a pretty cool show and Mike Rowe si great on it I have heard him on Opie & Anthony and he seems to be the same person as you see on the show.,1257033600,,155,3.3333333333333335
8336649,5,B001QW3TDQ,"I bought this as an anniversary present for my husband, and he LOVES it! He has watched every episode on these four discs multiple times and he still hasn't tired of them! It's so great not having to sit through commercials and he loves being able to isolate his favorite episodes to watch over and over. Great gift idea!",1250467200,3,321,4.4576271186440675
8336650,5,B001QW3TDQ,I gave this to my nephew for Christmas.  What a hit!  He is such a Mike Rowe fan.  The price was great and he loved the gift.,1249603200,,125,3.5555555555555554
