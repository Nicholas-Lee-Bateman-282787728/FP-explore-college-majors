8365748,5,B00295QFJE,One of my ALL-TIME favorite groups.  I saw them live at Schwagstock a few years back; betcha never heard of Schwagstock!  It's legendary in MO.,1416528000,,143,4.68
8365749,3,B00295QFJE,"I'm a big fan of this band and I believe that they make great music together.  When I saw that they had a DVD release, I jumped all over it.  I was sad to find that the production of this release leaves a lot to be desired.  It has a very bootleg quality and not in a good way.  The band's sound is in and out and to my ear, they never seem to really gel on this particular night.  That could be just because of the way that the sound is mixed; you don't ever seem to get the full presentation as intended.

I hope that in future they intend to release a live DVD that is up to the standards of their wonderful audio releases so we can all really experience the force of one of the best fusion acts of the modern era.",1251331200,,717,3.8767123287671232
