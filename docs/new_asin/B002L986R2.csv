Each segment is on a different archer and a particular aspect of their shot process. Each having their own particular style, it's a great way to learn about different techniques and experiment it within your own shot process.

The production quality is a bit dated but still professionally done. Audio is clear and video is good .",1523059200,,436,4.7368421052631575
