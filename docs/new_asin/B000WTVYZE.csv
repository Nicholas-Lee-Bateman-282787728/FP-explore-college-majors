2992278,5,B000WTVYZE,"This DVD is like a private house call with Mayo expert doctors.
I loved how they interacted with their patients.
All their tips are working for me.
After years of discomfort (and embarrassment) I'm on the road to relief.
Thank you Mayo Doctors for helping me to understand and manage my condition.",1201564800,4,297,4.730769230769231
2992279,1,B000WTVYZE,"Terrible. Do not purchase this if you have IBS. The information contained within is entirely things which you already know from having experienced the disorder, or things your doctor probably told you. It is almost as if the video is set up for people who are not afflicted with, but want to learn about IBS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, some of the information is so vague that attempts to follow it may actually make symptoms worse for some IBS sufferers. There is no explanation as to the different types of fiber available to us (soluable and non-soluable)which is the most basic tenet of getting IBS of any type under control. And the eating for health section is completely generalized, without any consideration for the fact that the person watching the video most likely has IBS. They are recommending foods like tomatoes and whole grain breads because of their nutritional value, ignoring the fact that these foods will exacerbate the problems of those suffering from IBS. I am very dissappointed by this production and it should not be supported in any fashion. Instead, i recommend two books, both by the same author, whose name i have forgotten, one called 'Living with IBS: Year One' and ""Eating for IBS"". They give far more in depth examinations of what we can do to lessen and alleviate many if not all of the symptoms associated with IBS. This DVD, on the other hand, offers only useless platitudes at best and dangerous misinformation at worst.",1200355200,28,1450,4.850806451612903

8225659,1,B000WTVYZE,not at all...I ended up returning it. The CD can only be played in DVD...not in computer's CD drive...too bad,1442534400,,109,4.5
8225660,5,B000WTVYZE,This was a useful guide on diet and exercise for irritable bowel issues.  My wife and I enjoyed the presentation diet discussion which was easy to understand.,1437004800,,158,4.851851851851852
8225661,5,B000WTVYZE,good one,1405468800,,8,3.5
8225662,4,B000WTVYZE,This DVD was exactly what I hoped it would be.  I got it for a friend who has IBS and he is having good results by using the suggestions in it.,1400025600,,143,3.6129032258064515
8225663,5,B000WTVYZE,I bought this DVD to replace the worn out one that I had already from some years ago.  The yoga and meditation videos on here are excellent.  The advice is a collection of the very best that I have come across.,1384560000,,210,4.097560975609756
8225664,1,B000WTVYZE,"I was excited to receive the DVD and looking forward to some relief for my symptoms.  However, when the DVD arrived it was scratched and would not play past the first 10 minutes.  Needless to say, I didn't bother to order another. -EH",1373760000,,234,4.4186046511627906
8225665,5,B000WTVYZE,really love the meditation support and videos are very well produced and easy to follow. The diet is also well produced,1371686400,,119,4.714285714285714
8225666,4,B000WTVYZE,"I've had IBS for almost 30 years, so I didn't hear a lot in this that I didn't already know. However, I was impressed with the way the information was presented and how it captures exactly what someone with IBS goes through. I would recommend that anyone with IBS show this to the ones closest to them to facilitate their understanding of your condition and to prove that it's not ""in your head"".

I do agree with one previous reviewer that the books ""The First Year: IBS"" and ""Eating for IBS"" by Heather Van Vorous are the gold standard as far as practical advice on managing your symptoms - I have both of these books and the latter one is well worn since it's full of recipes that I use regularly. I found the dietary advice on this DVD somewhat vague and lacking. But I enjoy the yoga and meditation segments. And, as I already stated, the explanation of what IBS is and what it entails is the best I've seen.",1325030400,2,913,4.3391812865497075
8225667,5,B000WTVYZE,I received the DVD about IBS and Weight Loss from my husband for Christmas.  As an IBS sufferer for most of my adult life I found this DVD to be helpful and clear in their explanation of IBS.  I enjoyed and are using the many dietary tips.  The Mayo clinic doctors are wonderful and offer great insight.  The weight loss DVD is great as well-down 5lbs and counting,1201564800,4,364,4.3088235294117645
