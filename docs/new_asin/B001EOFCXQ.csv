Each move is explained and demonstrated from different angles and is available in the two count styles of Salsa. The moves are great and broken down for both leader and follower. I would recommend this dvd for any intermediate to advanced Salsa dancer looking to really spice up their dancing. Great stuff, I look forward to buying more of azucena perez and carlos leons
 material.",1298160000,,551,4.739583333333333
8299085,5,B001EOFCXQ,"This is one of the best salsa instructional dvds that you can buy on amazon.  A word of warning, though, this is not for beginners, you need to be a strong intermediate at least.  You will learn great patterns that are broken down on 2.  After they explaniation, they are then danced on the one.  For on '1' dancers, I recomended watching the the explainations with the sound off.  Just start counting on the footwork on the count you would normally dance, and it will all work out that same way.
Also Carlos and Azucena teach in Austin, and if you ever want an experience to raise your salsa dancing level, have a lesson or two with Azucena, it will blow your mind.",1270166400,,666,4.382113821138211

8299087,5,B001EOFCXQ,"Carlos and Azucena are accomplished dancers and instructors from Austin, Texas. In this video they present several of their creative, stylish turn patterns and give styling tips along the way. The material is presented on1 and on2 and their breakdown of the patterns is easy to follow. The DVD is very high quality and is shot in HD in a really pretty setting, which is nice because alot of instructional videos look like they were taped with a home movie camera. I would recommend this video to any intermediate or advanced salsa dancer looking to add some cool patterns to their repertoire.",1219708800,2,592,4.813725490196078
