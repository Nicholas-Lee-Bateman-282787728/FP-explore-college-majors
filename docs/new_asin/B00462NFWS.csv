These are great films for anyone weather you've had addiction issues or not.
I saw Bedridden at it's premiere and it was really funny. It was great to see so many A-listers in this film. Joel David Moore (Avatar), Alan Tudyk (Firefly), Skyler Stone (Raising Hope) even Garrett Morris from Saturday night live!

Can't wait to get see it again!",1293926400,,378,4.478260869565218
8416953,5,B00462NFWS,"Saw this short film a few months back at a screening in Hollywood.  Wow.  It takes a very serious problem and turns it into a very funny movie.  If you've ever known anyone with a serious drug addiction, this will make you smile and stay with you for a while.  Hint:  The Bedpost he's chained to is a metaphor you can take on the subway.",1293926400,,337,4.123076923076923
