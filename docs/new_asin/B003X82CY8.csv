8407887,4,B003X82CY8,"Both of these movies are entertaining in their own ways.  Run Lola Run has one of the worst English dubs I've ever heard.  The voices are terrible, and actually painful to listen to.  So, I struggled through with my limited German language capabilities, and subtitles.  Still worth it.

Nikita was fine, all around. (still, avoid the English dub though)

A worthwhile purchase, regardless of the inconveniences.",1506211200,,411,5.151515151515151
8407888,5,B003X82CY8,"I love both of these movies especially ""Run Lola Run"" with its take on Einsteins Theory of Relativity where one event is happening endless times with different outcomes. ""La Femme Nikita"" is a classic and needs no more explaining by me.",1505865600,,236,4.780487804878049
8407889,5,B003X82CY8,"Usually, collection have one good movie, and one fluff piece they're trying to unload from their inventory.  Not here.  Both the original La Femme Nikita and Run Lola run are brilliant films.  It may be the best adrenaline filled double-feature led by female actors. The fact they aren't both action stars are shameful, as they carry these classics.",1460764800,,349,4.982758620689655

great female lead actresses.

8407892,3,B003X82CY8,"The Two-Pack Blu-ray of La Femme Nikita and Run Lola Run isn't for everyone. La Femme Nikita, directed by Luc Besson was a disappointment. I love Mr. Besson's work including some of my all-time favorites like ""The Fifth Element"", ""Wasabi"", ""From Paris with Love"" and others. The film also has some of my favorite French actors like Jean Reno and Anne Parillaud. Unfortunately, unless you speak French, the dubbed version leaves a lot to be desired. The translation from French to English was horrendous. The American version, ""Point of No Return"" with Bridget Fonda was much better. I give this film only two stars.

Run Lola Run is a good film if you have a taste for quirky foreign films. When I first saw the film 10 or more years ago, it was the first time I saw Franka Potente. She had an immediate effect on me. By the time she starred in the Bourne films, I was already a fan. Keep in mind that this film has some strange animation woven into the action and the action itself is almost non-stop and frenetic. All in all, the film is worth watching. I give this film four stars, which makes it a three star rating for the two pack.

My recommendation, buy Run Lola Run and forget La Femme Nikita. It's not worth the cost of the blu-ray, even with the discount.",1371081600,,1266,4.452586206896552
