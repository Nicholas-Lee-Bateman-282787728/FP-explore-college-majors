1752755,5,B00006G8FE,I had seen this movie on television and wanted one to keep.  Also to share with others as I love what these amazing dogs can do.  It also shows that dogs from the pound can achieve great things given a second chance.  The storyline is good too and it is fact not fiction.  Gives hope to all of us and makes us see that most lives can be changed when given a new direction.,1390435200,2,372,3.9864864864864864

1752761,5,B00006G8FE,"This is a fact-based film based upon the first prison, which happened to be a woman's prison, where enlisted inmates were selected to train helper dogs.  It is necessarily gritty at times and has the feel of 'happening,' rather than the Lifetime style where a tinkling piano cues and over-wrought acting overwhelms the viewer.

  ""Within These Walls"" is textured by the light hand of a director who respects the instincts, timing and pacing possible when great actors are given the opportunity to inhabit their characters.",1266105600,,522,5.105882352941176
