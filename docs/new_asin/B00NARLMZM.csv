6621385,3,B00NARLMZM,"Hello, this is Harold Brodie, I am listed as the ""director"" here. I just wanted to clarify a few things here for anyone interested in this ""film."" Unlike most ""found footage"" fictional works, Final Entries is actually footage that was found. I am on the record about this with an interview at the ""B Is For Best"" movie site. The interview is quite long so I won't recap it all here, so just search for it, if you like. In that interview I explain where the film came from and its history since I came across it. It's all very weird, trust me. Look, I am not pitching for anyone to watch this, or like it, or whatever. It is what it is. All I hope for is that people who are curious about it learn more, because it may not be (or may be?) what you think it is. Myself, I just don't know. I was hoping that with the release of the film, someone would come forward, but that has not happened yet. We're still waiting.",1416787200,8,914,4.140449438202247
8676853,1,B00NARLMZM,"I don't know where to start on my check list of all the things I didn't like about this movie. Well,here we go,the 1st 30 minutes were the most boring and useless to the plot of any found footage I've watched. You could actually start looking on your laptop at about the 30-35 min mark and not miss anything except two of the most unlikable,nasty,foul mouthed,female stars ever. Oh,thats not all,its not like the movie suddenly picked up,it was boring,and just didn't make any since at all. AT ALL!!! So theres two obnoxious girls(farting in each others face to awaken each other,,foul mouthed,etc),sharing a cabin and a strange stranger shows up. Of course the big dummys make him welcome. If you can watch it free and your a found footage fanatic like me............PASS ANYWAY!!!!!",1429574400,,784,4.858208955223881
8676854,1,B00NARLMZM,"Watched this because I love the found footage horror genre but this was one of the worst I have seen. There is no story line, the acting is terrible and I only watched to the end hoping there would be some sort of twist to redeem it. I was disapointe all the way aaround!",1426291200,2,271,4.037037037037037
8676855,4,B00NARLMZM,"This wasn't bad ! I'm sure all the professional reviewers out there will come unculed, but it really isn't bad. The girls do a good job of acting - - very believable.",1425513600,,166,4.21875

8676857,4,B00NARLMZM,"Maybe it's because this is the first ""found film"" I've ever seen (my friend's college-age son recommended it), but I thought it was kind of cool. It seemed real, although like the other reviewer, that might be questionable, but then, so what? Since I had no real expectations, the pace didn't bother me, and I started to enjoy the dialogue as it felt realistic, with humor and anger, what you'd expect from a couple of teen girls in this situation. The Guy was pretty creepy (no spoilers!) and added another level of discomfort. I'll admit the ending left me wondering, but then if it's ""found"", it would be a lot more suspicious if it was all neatly wrapped up, right? Definitely worth the rental price, and made me curious to watch a few others like it!",1424995200,,755,4.5588235294117645

8676859,1,B00NARLMZM,"Rented this movie because I am always on the look out for new found footage movies. But this was just plain boring and was actually like watching a teen's real home movie of her and her friend being young and doing dumb things that teens do. I kept checking to see how much time was left till it was over, and tried to not fall asleep. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1423180800,,372,4.180555555555555
8676860,1,B00NARLMZM,"It started out funny, the girls were a hoot! Then it driveled down to a really bad high school project that left me feeling embarrassed for watching it all.",1422230400,,156,4.413793103448276
8676861,1,B00NARLMZM,"**NO SPOILERS** I'm a big fan of ""found footage"" horror/thrillers ('m almost Pavlovian when it comes to seeing a new release that even mentions found footage and horror in the same sentence :) and I've seen and reviewed perhaps 100 or so of them in the last two or three years. Most of them are c-movie, microbudget disasters than can now make their way onto Amazon fairly easily with self-publishing, etc., so you have to wade through a lot of chaff before you can find any real wheat. Having said that, I can say that ""Final Entries"" is indeed unique - and yes, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation, so allow me to try and explain without wasting as much of your time as the writer and director of this thing did with me.

Getting to the point: this video is...bizarre yet still manages to be utterly boring. It does start somewhat interestingly, with a confrontation, and you go along expecting the slow build and some eventual payoff. But, ultimately, this one is just a very, very boring film that wasted an hour and 19 minutes - and at that, having just finished watching it, all it is, is a long, drawn out tale that might have made for an interesting 10 minute short film. Instead, they chose to stretch it out and make a somewhat feature-length video. There are no scares, no thrills, and the plot and script are dull and ultimately lead nowhere, despite the effort at a supernatural-ish twist in the last 1/3 of the film.

My suggestion is definitely do not waste your time or money on this one. Even for avid found footage fans, this one will disappoint badly. This reminded me a bit of the recent ""Mockingbird"" found footage movie, though I found that film far more interesting and worth my time. Also, and to be fair, the two teen lead actresses did a decent job - good job, ladies - with what they had to work with.",1421280000,5,1837,4.464285714285714
8676862,3,B00NARLMZM,This was a fast one for me just watch did not catch on  got  watch again but a lot of fans may not like slow footage movies like ithis very slow it may be not enough action in this picture  people may or will get bored fast and. Not satisfied. Me um a movie junkie  its worth my time  but  I would not  sleep on.this,1417219200,2,316,3.769230769230769
