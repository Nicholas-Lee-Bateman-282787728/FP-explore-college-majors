6964642,4,B00S8M03WW,"An ardent fan of The Beatles -- a middle-aged school teacher -- is determined to meet John Lennon when he hears about the singer/songwriter's sojourn in Spain. This is his golden opportunity to hear the words directly from the horse's mouth (figuratively speaking). Well, literally, since some of Lennon's lyrics he just couldn't get them right. So, he drives down to Almeria to set the record straight (pun intended). ;) Along his arduous journey to where Lennon is ostensibly shooting for a film, teacher meets two nonconforming teenagers. But now, the guards won't let them meet the celebrity singer. So what happens? Find out. :) Now here's the best part - after that trip to Spain in 1966, all LP jackets for The Beatles music carried song lyrics. That's a fact! Such a delightful film - Last weekend NetFlix had obliged, but I'd love to watch it again if/when Amazon Prime is streaming it.  ;)",1433808000,,899,4.8
6964643,5,B00S8M03WW,"I was a little turned off by the title and ignored this film for quite a while.  Fortunately I gave it a try and was so happy that I did.  This is a true gem, one of the most satisfying films I've seen in a while.  Knowing very little about the Franco era in Spain I didn't really fully understand the significance of the Beatles to the mild mannered schoolteacher who is the main character in the film.  Fortunately, better informed viewers filled me in on that!  I also didn't understand the significance of the title until I read it here.  Likewise I didn't know that John Lennon had actually made a film in Spain at that time.  Duh!

However even in my ignorance of the greater political/social implications I totally loved the human story of three strangers whose lives intersected in an accidental, but providential way;  Now, knowing more I can appreciate it even more.  The story is lovely, magical, a total tribute to the spirit  of the Beatles.  I'm sure John Lennon would have loved it.  I hope that more people see it.  .",1431820800,4,1033,4.483870967741935
6964644,5,B00S8M03WW,"After fifty years, it is still difficult to assess the full effect the Beatles have had on our culture. Even with the emergence of truth-tellers such as Bob Dylan in the early 60s, the full flowering of independent thinkers and irreverent behavior was not fully realized until the Beatles arrived to help make it a permanent transformation. While the impact of the Beatles was greatest in the U.S. and Britain, the sense of being a part of a new community was felt even in totalitarian regimes where the hippie look and the Beatle-style longhair among teens became a reason for a resurgence of hope even when accompanied by establishment panic.

The subject is explored with confidence in writer/director David Truebas (Soldiers of Salamina) Living is Easy with Eyes Closed, winner of six Goya Awards, the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars. Inspired by a real incident, the title of the comedy/drama mirrors the first line of the Beatles song Strawberry Fields Forever whose lyrics signal attention to the growing use of psychedelics. Set in Spain in 1966 during the last years of the oppressive Franco regime, Antonio, played by veteran actor Javier Cmera (Im So Excited), is a single and somewhat lonely English teacher who is a devoted Beatles fan and uses their lyrics as a teaching tool.

When he hears that the famous Beatle John Lennon is filming Richard Lesters How I Won the War in the south of Spain, he decides to take some time off and drive down to Almeria with the hopes of meeting John and asking him to include his song lyrics in future albums. Along the way, Antonio picks up two young hitchhikers, both on the run from unpleasant situations at home, Beln (Natalia de Molina) a three-month pregnant 20-year-old leaving the nunnery where she was sent by her mother, and Juanjo (Francesc Colomer, Barcelona Summer Night), a 16-year-old boy (oddly a Rolling Stones fan) who has run away from his abusive father after an argument over his Beatles-style haircut.

Although there is some initial uneasiness, Antonios friendly, talkative nature allows them to relax and feel comfortable. Once in Almeria, the trio bond in a local farmhouse and the more experienced Beln has much to teach her new young friend. Though the film abounds with warmth and humor, especially when Antonio attempts to fulfill his dream of meeting John, there are some dark moments as well. A local bully, who may or may not be a stand-in for the Franco regime, messes up Juanjos thick mop of hair and worse but the bullys strawberry fields will not last forever.

Beautifully photographed by Daniel Vilar (The Artist and the Model) and buoyed by authentic performances from the entire cast, Living is Easy with Eyes Closed touches deep human emotions. Though the coming of age theme is fairly common in world cinema, rarely has it been done with such tenderness and intelligence, and its message of standing up to fear even though you may look foolish in the process is an important one. When Antonio tells his young friends that, you cant live in fear. Too many people in Spain live in fear, its a comment with multiple undertones. Living may be easier with your eyes closed, but it is much more satisfying when they are open.",1431820800,7,3211,4.832727272727273
6964645,2,B00S8M03WW,"Tried to finish this a few times, but just didn't connect with anything about it. Slow and fragmented.  I wanted to like it due to topic, but just didn't.",1431043200,,154,4.310344827586207
6964646,5,B00S8M03WW,"Rather quiet but never a dull moment. I felt as though I was watching slightly quirky decent people in back-road atmospheric Spain and sharing an interesting bit of their lives. That was enough to enjoy it. I am the 5th reviewer and probably can't add much to the comments of the other four 5 stars.

I do have some familiarity with Spain under Franco and felt that there was a very subtle aroma of the hardness for many Spaniards at the time, and the quiet struggle to pursue one's humanity and dreams. I don't think this  was overplayed in any way, but it may have hit Spaniards harder than it would an English speaking audience. In those times the Beatles meant the possibility of happiness for many young people around the world living in boring and/or repressive societies.",1430870400,8,778,4.630434782608695
6964647,5,B00S8M03WW,"A wonderful film that captures that moment in time when the world began to change thanks to a new consciousness inspired by The Beatles and the genius of John Lennon.

6964648,5,B00S8M03WW,"Nice little movie - not one of the cinematic treasures of all time, but a well-crafted, well acted movie that is definitely, definitely worth a couple of hours of your time. I saw it a few days ago during the DC Film Festival, and I'm so glad I did. It's sweet, and sometimes bittersweet, and underneath, a subtle reminder how art (in this case, music) can nurture you even when the rest of your life is not giving you much sustenance.",1429488000,,435,4.382716049382716
6964649,5,B00S8M03WW,"In 1966, the Beatles were still together but each started working on solo projects. John Lennon wanted to try his hand at acting and headed off to Almeria in Spain to star in Richard Lester's film ""How I Won the War"". This was a point in time when Spain was still under the rule of General Franco and there was control on pop music and the like.  With this as a background, writer/Director David Trueba created a story of a grade-school teacher who was a true Beatles fan who decides to head off to try to meet his idol, Lennon. On the way he picks up a pregnant young woman and a young man - who has just left home because his parents don't understand why he wants to grow his hair to look like the Beatles. The film follows their road trip together. I don't like spoilers so I won't tell you how it ends but the actors are so engaging that you follow their journey with compassion.

The 108-minute ""road trip""  film was released in 2013 but now just making its home video release. The score was composed by jazz guitarist Pat Metheny and jazz bass player Charlie Haden and has an ""Americana"" feel to it - though it works perfectly. (I intend to seek out the soundtrack album - if one exists).

The DVD contains two short bonuses: First are a couple of deleted scenes (totally about 4 minutes) which really wouldn't have added much if kept in the film. The other ""bonus"" shows Metheny and Haden in the recording studio laying down the soundtrack. No dialogue here; just music. This runs about three minutes. Oh yes, there is also the theatrical trailer.

The subtitles in English are easy to read, for which I'm thankful.

As for the film's title.. it comes from a Lennon/McCartney song. I won't say which one - you'll learn near the end of the film - but I was embarrassed that I didn't guess it.

All three main cast members were new to me but I'd love to see them in something else (especially Natalia De Molina, the young pregnant woman. I literally could not take my eyes off of her. Her face will draw you in too.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6964650,5,B00S8M03WW,"Franco's Spain during Beatlemania...Beatlemania in Franco's Spain
A self-contained yet lonely English teacher with a sweet obsession for the Beatles sets off on a journey to meet his idol, John Lennon.  Along the way he picks up two young, downtrodden yet hopeful misfits. They join him on an oddly serene road trip to the coastal town of Almeria. The viewer is inextricably drawn into each individual's search for freedom in a land that offers so little of that.  The story is engaging. The acting is sublime. The cinematography is an homage to the rough landscape, which mirrors the bleakness of Franco's Spain, while the succulent and sweet fruit that sprouts from that same bleak landscape a sign of the hope that all three characters carry.
I went to this film with absolutely no idea what it was about and walked out of the theater feeling so touched, so satisfied, and so uplifted. I can only say:  Go see this film!!!",1423353600,19,925,4.76875
6964651,4,B00S8M03WW,"""Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed"" (2013 release from Spain) brings the story of Antonio, a thirty-something English teacher. The time is 1066 and the place is Spain. Antonio is Beatles-obsessed, and as the movie opens we see him using the lyrics of ""Help"" to teach his class. When Antonio finds out that John Lennon is in southern Spain (to film ""How I Won the War""), Antonio decides to drive down, determined to meet Lennon. Along the way, Antonio picks up two teenage runaways: first there is Beln, whom we later learn escaped from a nuns' caretaker place to go back to her mom in Malaga. A bit later there is Juango, a 16 yr. old who tired of his father's dictatorial antics. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from well-known Spanish writer-director David Trueba (he also brought us ""Madrid, 1987""). Here, Trueba mixes facts (Lennon was indeed in Almeria, Spain then, and he did write the basis for ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" at that time) and fiction (the three main characters) to bring us a wonderful little film about the hopes and dreams of these three people who come to depend on each other more than they realize, and along the way find a renewed lease on life. The movie does a great job of establishing the insecurities and flaws of the main characters, without ever going overboard or falling into sentimentalism. Natalia de Molina (remarkably similar in appearance to Dakota Johnson) is sensational as Beln  You'll enjoy the movie even more if you are a Beatles fan (is there anyone who doesn't like the Beatles?). At one point, Antonio laments the fact that the Beatles albums do not contain the lyrics to the songs. ""John, give us a break!"", he sighs, ha! Also, I don't know this for a fact, but I believe that the demo version that we hear in the movie of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" is the same one that we hear (partially) on the Beatles Anthology 2 compilation0.

I recently stumbled upon this movie while browsing the foreign film section at my local library. So glad that I picked this up! As the movie approached its conclusion, I so wished that it could've played just a little longer, as I was not ready to say goodbye to these three endearing characters. If you are in the mood for a top notch foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1456012800,,2452,4.6192660550458715

6964653,5,B00S8M03WW,"This is a wonderful film. I would say that John Lenon, Beatles' songs, or Franco's Spain of the '60s are not the core of this movie's theme but just the scenery. What really impressed me was the main hero, the middle aged, bald, unassuming, sensitive, single, school teacher Antonio, and his attitude toward life and children in particular. Antonio is the real essence of teaching and caring for kids. His persistence to meet his music idol despite many obstacles, combined with the genuine tenderness he shows to children of all ages (including those with serious disabilities), but also his ethos and character, are moving. The film makes you think what really matters in life and how a charismatic man can teach simply by his personal example. It won six Goya Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Writing and Best Leading Actor. It was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.",1451606400,,975,4.915151515151515

6964656,5,B00S8M03WW,"I've raved about writer/director David Trueba's film to so many people, I've probably started turning them off.  But that won't stop me from doing it again here.  This complete surprise of a movie -- I defy you not to be moved at the end -- dominated Spain's Goyas.  It's easy to see why.  It's cinematic magic.

To be upfront: Like many others, I worship the canon of John Lennon.  So, to see that someone crafted a film out of Lennon's time spent in Almeria in 1966 to film ""How I Won the War""...well, that's enough to shoot any fan steeped in the arcania of Beatles history into fits of joy.  And, moreover, the main narrative -- that of Javier Cmara's character driving to meet Lennon so he could get him to translate Beatles lyrics (supposedly the impetus for all Beatles releases after that to include lyrics) -- is based on a true story.  As is the backstory that Lennon conceived one of his masterpieces, 'Strawberry Fields Forever',  while in Almeria (a fact known not even to Richard Lester who directed ""How I Won the War"" and was thrilled by Trueba's film). Well done, David Trueba!

But even non-Beatles fans will love the movie.  My wife falls into that category.  Trueba hooks them, too, because he's stitched together an equally compelling story parallel to the Lennon tale that provides the backdrop.  It's a classic road trip tale: Cmara's Antonio plus passengers Beln and Juanjo (a fetching Natalia de Molina and impressive newcomer Francesc Colomer), each running away from repressive situations.  All this plays out against the background of a gray, severe Spain of the Franco era.  Indeed, the hues and stringency of Trueba's film could not be more different than the colorful explosions of Almodvar, what first springs to mind when western audiences think about Spanish cinema.",1438387200,,1800,4.836601307189542

8697682,3,B00S8M03WW,"Living Is Easy With Eyes Closed has a cute, picturesque aesthetic, yet its sterile production quality robs the drama of any plausibility. The actors depicting the three key characters are better suited for cellphone advertisements than they are for representing thinking, feeling beings. As a result, my attention naturally started shifting towards the eye-catching landscapes and seascapes of Spain. The main character is a geeky Beatles fan and English instructor in the midst of a mid-life crisis who receives word that John Lennon will be in Almeria for the filming of How I Won the War. Revelling in this exciting bit of news, he quickly organizes a road trip with the hope of meeting him. Lacking company, but not wanting to travel alone, he picks up two runaways and offers them an opportunity to ride with him to Almeria. One gets the impression that this movie was made by a first-time director overly preoccupied with making everything look postcard-perfect. Some Beatles fans might be interested, but most will find it lacking, not only in Beatles content, but in its ability to entertain. Cynthia Lennon is portrayed as a witchy crank, probably for dramatic effect, however, the portrayal is far from believable. I found this lighthearted drama to be of the neutral variety, not really disliking it, but feeling as if it was far too meticulous in its staging and too long. I couldn't recommend this to anyone except those who tend to be pleased with most movies.",1510704000,,1474,4.97165991902834

8697690,5,B00S8M03WW,"This wonderful little film from Spain was directed and written by David Trueba (Welcome Home) and won a host of European awards including the Spanish version of the Oscars for best picture and more.  Also nominated was its excellent score by American jazz guitarist, Pat Metheny.  Javier Camara (Talk to Her) plays Antonio, a 40-something English and Latin teacher in Madrid.  He uses lyrics from Beatles songs to instruct his students.  He is a big fan, especially of John Lennon.  When he learns that Lennon will be the coastal town of Almeria filming Richard Lesters 1967 movie How I Won the War, hes determined to go there over the weekend and meet him.

Along the way he picks up a couple of hitchhikers.  First there is Belen (Natalia de Molina), a young woman, maybe 19 or 20 who is about 3 months preggers.  Shes headed to a place to have the baby where they will then place it up for adoption.  Shes conflicted, alone and scared.  Antonio is a happy go lucky guy, easy to talk to and a bit goofy.  Next they pick up a 16 year old runaway named Juanjo (Francesc Colomer).  He comes from a large family and resents his classmates and especially his policeman father who nag him about his Beatles mop-top haircut.  Although in a funny bit, he tells Antonio he prefers the Rolling Stones and The Kinks to the Beatles.

Truebas tidy little road trip lands in the small town where they befriend a local innkeeper and tavern owner.  The trio get along well, even to the point where Belen, in a poignant moment, allows Juanjo to get to second base and a little more.  But for Juanjo it all results in a home run.  The film is never lurid or intimidating but offers some tender moments with all of the characters.  Trueba takes his time with the each, allowing the audience to become invested in what happens to them.  Even secondary characters like the tavern owner and his disabled son become important parts of the story.

The photography is excellent providing some great scenes of the sometimes dusty countryside.  The film gets its title from a line from Lennons Strawberry Fields Forever which Lennon wrote while working on his movie.  This is a funny, heartwarming cinematic surprise and worth seeking out.  Highly recommended.",1467936000,,2235,4.674358974358975
