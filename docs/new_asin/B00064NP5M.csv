8609914,5,B00064NP5M,"I'm a computer teacher for 4-8th graders at a public school in New Jersey. In our computer lab we have 45 computers that are on average about 3-4 years old each. Many of the computers started to slow down because of the heavy use and programs that the students use on the computers on a daily basis.

Our budget for our computer system is not enough to cover new computers every years so doing some research online I came across this video. I purchased a copy and figured I didn't have much to lose. I have to say I was shocked at how much information was covered on this DVD. Not only did it help speed up the computers in our classroom, but I actually have had the video approved by our Board of Ed to allow it to be viewed by our students in our classroom. It covers a broad amount of topics related to computer security, online identify theft, and tons of trouble shooting techniques like how to fix Windows errors, startup problems, slow computer speeds and much more.

Many of my students have learned great tips and techniquest to help out their parents with their computers at home. Many parents like myself did not have the luxury of growing up with computers so their children (my students) are the main computer users at their house. I've had my compliments from parents that their children have helped fix their computers at home.

This video has been part of my curriculum now for 2 years, and have had great reviews from both my students as well as fellow teachers. I highly recommend this video for both young and old computer users alike (If my 4th grade students can understand this video, anyone can). You can't get a better value for your money when it comes to a video that is easy to watch and covers so much valuable information.",1227571200,4,1751,4.465625
8609915,5,B00064NP5M,"This video was exactly what I was looking for. My computer is starting to get old (around 5 years old), and I noticed when it was starting up it would take around 7 minutes for Windows to load. This video showed me how to clean up the computer to remove all the old junky programs that were slowing it down. Now it starts up in less than 3 minutes. Plus I noticed all the programs like AOL loads faster too. Im not very good at computers, but I now feel a lot more confident. There is a lot of information on the video, but its organized easy in the menus and everything is explained in terms I can easily understand. They also have a great part about identify theft which was very good. Overall I would recommend this video for all computer users. Especially older people like myself who are not that knowledgeable with computers and didn't have the luxury of growing up with them.  This video really explains things out in terms every computer can understand.",1202860800,4,961,4.429378531073446
