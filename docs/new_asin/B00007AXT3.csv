7974924,4,B00007AXT3,Stupid me.  Did not think to check netflix first to see if they had this.  If you have netflix get it from there.  Luckily I was able to resell on the big bidder site.,1395532800,,167,3.8529411764705883
7974925,1,B00007AXT3,This is the worst excuse for a traing video I have ever seen.  It is a total waste of time and money.  Would not recommend it.,1366934400,,126,3.8076923076923075
7974926,4,B00007AXT3,"I ordered this to help train my lab, it is almost solely about using a shock collar.  The quality is lacking but the information is good.  I would recomend it but only for those who are serious dog trainers and have some experience with a shock collars use already.",1338854400,,265,4.387755102040816
7974927,5,B00007AXT3,"""Top Dog"" DVD is the ""bible"" for electronic training of waterfowl and upland retrievers and pointing dogs!  It breaks down the training into simple, 15 minute steps and displays a red dot on the screen whenever the electronic simulation is applied to my dog.  This takes all the guess work out and makes the training much faster and more humane!!

Training with the electronic collar is definitely the way to go, once your dog has the basics taught in the ""Water Dog"" DVD.  Now, I can control my dog at 100 yards!!",1202428800,,514,4.554347826086956
7974928,5,B00007AXT3,"This video teaches you how to train a dog using an electronic collar.  I would not recommend it to a novice, because an electronic collar is an advanced technique.",1174521600,,163,4.620689655172414
7974929,5,B00007AXT3,"Top Dog touches on the proper way of using an electronic collar and stresses again and again that the collar is not used to teach the dog from the start but to reinforce what you have already taught the dog through shown and verbal commands.

I do not have a dog but bought the video because my retail store sells electronic collars and I want to know a little about them. I thought the video would require toothpicks to keep my eyes open- far from it !

All throughout the video is shown HOW to teach your dog techniques and also touches on his other videos if you want to go more in depth on other dog-trick skills. The video has advice on how to fix trouble spots. Top Dog shows a dog putting to use the techniques shown on the video- like the dog retrieving a downed duck way far away from the blind set up . The dog goes for the duck and is out in the middle of the water treading but doesn't find the duck. The dog looks back to the master and knows where to go based on the masters body movements that are taught in the video.  This video was expensive but far worth it. very well put together on an 84 minute dvd",1151452800,,1120,4.081818181818182
7974930,1,B00007AXT3,I got this flick and started watching it but there was no Chuck Norris. It's NOT the awesome Chuck Norris flick that shares the same name so BEWARE. I'm sure you got confused and clicked on it because you wanted Chuck Norris but he's not here. This is just some terrible thing about nothing.,1118016000,,291,4.407407407407407
