8419228,1,B0002OXVC8,"The first was incredibly hard-hitting and difficult to watch; but it had purpose and drive. There was a point and it hid away from nothing, giving a clear indication of it's goal. It was well produced and for all the sickening footage on display, leading to a grim finale, you walked away from it feeling that you've watched something important, albiet horrendous.

This second installment is little more than a video slideshow of snuff. Aside from leading with footage shown in the original, there is no narrative, no purpose and no justification for the viewer to stomach this ordeal. If you have watched, and no doubt been somewhat enlightened by the original, do not expect the same from this. If, however, you enjoy clip shows of random death with no intent to educate, you may very well find your fill. Just don't admit that you paid for it.",1242345600,,847,4.722972972972973
8419229,5,B0002OXVC8,"I've seen a lot of indy movies over the year but, nothing can hold up against these three movies.  I've seen a screener copy of DEMON SLAUGHTER and DEAD BODY MAN a few months ago and I was blowen away by both flicks.  They are both low budget movies, but done in a style that I can't discribe.  Most indy movies are boring and I usually end up fast forwarding them but, not with these movies.  They really entertain you from start to finish.  Demon Slaughter is a complete action flick done in the style of the Evil Dead Movies.  Dead Body Man is dark comedy about a Serial Killer who is just trying to get by.  I loved these flicks and if they are out on DVD, then I would grab them.  Plus I'm sure the DVD's are full of kinds of extra goodies.  So, if your looking for some cool indy films, then you can't go wrong with this 3 pack.",1094169600,4,834,4.067484662576687

He's the head honcho of 4th Floor Pictures and has been writing, producing, and directing indie horror flicks for years. Once again, he delivers the goods with this box set. Serial Killer is unique take on this particular genre. If you like your horror with a psychological twist this is for you. Dead Body Man is a dark comedy with plenty of nudity and gore. Finally, Demon Slaughter is slick horror flick that mixes in mafia action and suspense. You can't go wrong with a movie that has wise guys, hitmen, zombies, and even the devil himself. This one appeals to comic book fans as well as horror fans. If your fed up with mainstream horror and its lack of originality, do yourself a favor and check this box set out.",1093392000,3,809,4.5793103448275865
