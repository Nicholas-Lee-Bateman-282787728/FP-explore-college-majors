8106324,5,B000E63Q2E,"Let's take a trip, you and I, back in time...back to when 'politically correct' meant you voted for the winning candidate. Back to a time when using a name like 'Warriors' was not considered disrespectful to anyone. When 'native American' meant you were born here. The Marquette Warriors basketball team was led by one of the fiercest 'warriors' of all: Al McGuire. In 1977 he took his team to the pinnacle of college basketball, winning the NCAA championship against one Dean Smith and his NC Tarheels. Al turned the tables on Dean, using one of Smith's favorite tactics: the stall. Coach McGuire was one of the great ones, and I am glad he finally made it to the top. Dean finally made it, too...but not for several more years.",1197763200,5,729,4.658914728682171
