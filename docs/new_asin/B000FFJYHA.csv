2562559,5,B000FFJYHA,"For us ' Hawaiian at heart', This movie is why we love Hawaii. What a great portrayal of The Duke ! As Don Ho once said, ' most visitors leave Hawaii without knowing more than the beauty of our beaches and the excitement of a luau' , they never get to know the Hawaiian people or the culture- that have made these Islands so very special ! This movie shows what can happen to someone, Kawika, when you are 'taken in' by this place known as Hawaii.  Great story ,great scenery and a wonderful use of Hawaiian language. You'll never get tired of viewing this movie, I know I don't. I miss that kulana kai !",1195516800,3,604,4.206896551724138
2562560,5,B000FFJYHA,"Ever since I saw it on Waikiki beach in the summer of 2003, I knew this was a movie to love.  Recommended for all ages.",1185148800,3,119,3.76
2562561,5,B000FFJYHA,"A great movie that really captures the true sense of Aloha and how Duke and many other great Hawai'ian people have the true Island Spirit.  Not many tourists can see that Spirit of Aloha in the Islands today...but if you look hard and give respect to the people and the places of their land some might find it's way into your heart.

The love of the ocean and the gift of surfing... 'riding the wave, not the board' is apparent.  Much can be learned from the Hawai'ian culture and it's people, just take a moment the next time you visit the Islands to drink in the Ohana.  The surfing on the old style boards is great... take out one of those boards and you had to be a real waterman.

Aloha & Mahalo, Mike",1177459200,6,706,4.2388059701492535
2562562,5,B000FFJYHA,"I first saw this movie on a plane coming back from Oahu, Hawaii. I am really impressed by how the movie conveys the history of Hawaii and what it was like before it became so commercialized. I recommend this film for anyone who truly loves the beauty and history of Hawaii. There is some great surfing too! The movie explains the origins of Duke and how he shaped the sport of surfing. Now when I go to Duke's (restaurant) I understand his role and how important he is to the Hawaiian people. Rent it!",1167696000,12,501,4.340425531914893

2562569,5,B000FFJYHA,"David Monroe, dubbed Ghost, is humbled when he wipes out and finds himself in old Hawai'i, saved by none other then Paoa ""Duke"" Kahanamoku himself.

I enjoyed seeing old Hawai'i. Not a lot of people know that Waikiki and what is now Ala Moana Shopping Center, was all swamps. The characters, the CGI removing the hotels, and the costumes were excellent! Even the soundtrack was nice, with Hapa, Keali'i Reichel, etc. I really liked ""On the beach at Waikiki"" being put into the mix as well.

This is a great movie! I've been ""borrowing"" my friend's copy for too long so I went to Native Books and finally bought one. Nathan Kurosawa, at Third Reef Pictures, excellent movie! I'll go on your website and buy it again if I lose my copy.",1278288000,4,733,4.545454545454546
2562570,5,B000FFJYHA,"This DVD is a great surf movie!  Anyone who loves surfing or some of the history of Hawaii and surfing, would love this movie.  I show this at work and of all the movies I show here, there is always at least one person, if not more, that asks me about this movie.",1229904000,2,263,3.943396226415094
2562571,5,B000FFJYHA,"I saw this film on a flight to Hawaii and forgot the name.  I asked all the surfers, anyone who knows the culture, etc.....and nobody knew.  I cannot remember how I eventually found it, but when I did I said ""yahoo"" and bought it!  It's FANTASTIC!

Made my eyes tear to see Duke and feel the experience of being on Waikiki in days gone by.

I recommend this to anyone interested in Hawaii, surfing or wanting to see a really good film.  (I'm a sci-fi fan, so the time travel was a plus.)",1209945600,3,487,4.182795698924731
2562572,5,B000FFJYHA,"I love this movie. I am a surfer living in Hawaii and I have always appreciated Duke Kahanamoku's gift of surfing to the world. It's a fun look at what life might have been like for Duke and his beachboy friends back in the day. Back when life was simple...no phones...no traffic...clean water and air. Hawaii is different today, but, most people still have the aloha spirit. If you want to travel back in time for a couple of hours and visit old Hawaii watch this movie. Aloha!!",1207008000,2,479,4.454545454545454

8121685,5,B000FFJYHA,"Helps if you have an overwhelming love of Hawaii and history of Surfing. Little bit of comedy and romance mixed together. Watched it a on the plane coming home from Maui and I was hooked, I had to add it to my video collection.",1476144000,,227,4.181818181818182
8121686,5,B000FFJYHA,would you like to see honolulu in 1911?This movie is the Back To The future with a surfboard and not a delorean. This is a movie that you will watch MANY times in the future.,1454544000,2,174,4.0
8121687,5,B000FFJYHA,"I love this movie for my students (middle school). It is highly visual, gently and innocently romantic, and does give a fairly accurate portrayal of duke in a very compelling way. He was known not just for his surfing and swimming ability, but for his aloha in accepting and befriending 'haoles' when many of the other locals did not. It also has some great surfing scenes, especially on the old wooden boards of that era, to show how difficult surfing them really was.",1444953600,2,469,4.662650602409639
