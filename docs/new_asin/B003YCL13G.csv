8408954,4,B003YCL13G,"Please keep in mind that you get what you pay for when you buy these bundle packs. The image will not be crystal clear (in most cases the films have not even been restored) and the dubbing is going to be bad. With that said, if you are a fan of Eurocrime (mainly Italian police and mafia dramas from the 1970s) and do not mind bad dubbing this is a good set for the money.
  The set includes: Mister Scarface, The Cop in Blue Jeans, The Cynic the Rat and the Fist, The Master Touch, and Violent Naples. Some of these films are violent even by today's standards (just a warning in case you wanted to watch with children in the room). The only reason I put that in there is that the set does not provide the buyer with a rating.
  If you know what you are buying you are in for a treat. The Cynic, The Rat, and The Fist is a very good Dirty Harry type film, as is Violent Naples. The set alone is worth it for those two. The other films are pretty good Mister Scarface and the Master Touch coming next then The Cop in Blue Jeans.",1408492800,,1027,4.044334975369458
8408955,4,B003YCL13G,"PopFlix, Mill Creek, Videoasia, Echo Bridge, the list goes on. Crummy looking version of rare films crammed onto as few discs as possible, costing less than ten dollars. Most of the time you're better off going with other versions, but sometimes there just aren't any other options.

I bought this set because it features The Cynic, the Rat & the Fist and Violent Naples in widescreen. These two films are incredibly difficult to find. Having them here makes up for the obvious flaws of this set. But I'll go in the order the film are presented.

The first flick is the Fernando di Leo film titled MISTER SCARFACE. This film was originally released as I PADRONI DELLA CITTA aka RULERS OF THE CITY. While I believe this is not one of di Leo's best films, it certainly bears watching. The print included in this set, however, comes with a fullscreen crop and extremely muddy visuals. What I would recommend is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fernando-Di-Leo-Crime-Collection-Caliber-9-The-Italian-Connection-The-Boss-Rulers-of-the-City-Blu-ray/dp/B005MTHRDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fernando Di Leo Crime Collection (Caliber 9 / The Italian Connection / The Boss / Rulers of the City) [Blu-ray</a>], which has MISTER SCARFACE and three other fantastic polizioteschi directed by di Leo complete with stellar transfers. I wouldn't bother with the version included here.

Second, THE COP IN BLUE JEANS. I am not sure that a widescreen print of this is available in the United States at all. If someone releases it, I'll more than likely buy it. Despite my problems with watching films shot in widescreen formatted to 1:33:1, the print isn't terrible. While it won't widen any eyes, it is very watchable in terms of sharpness and detail. Don't misunderstand: this is not a good looking print by any means. It can justify its existence by being a readily available version of a hard to find film.

The second disc houses the remaining three films, all of them in widescreen. This is the meat of the package, and the reason to buy this set.

THE CYNIC, THE RAT & THE FIST, THE MASTER TOUCH, and VIOLENT NAPLES are overall pretty sharp, decent looking prints. For the low price tag, they are well worth it. MASTER TOUCH looks the worst of the three, but it is by degrees as none of them approach even the meager standards set by B-Movie distributors like Media Blasters. Still, though, two Umberto Lenzi films from his prime in widescreen was enough to make me salivate.

I would have paid twice what I did for only the second disc. The two Lenzi movies were essential viewing for me, and THE MASTER TOUCH was a great throw-in. I'm very satisfied with this product, but I would not hesitate to part with it if restorations of the films on the second disc were to surface.",1378598400,,2807,5.064935064935065
8408956,4,B003YCL13G,"This review is from the two-disc collection, as opposed to the four disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mafia-Kingpin-Collection/dp/B0076YFJ3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mafia Kingpin Collection</a>.

I enjoy European genre films from the sixties and seventies - I think they often make up for their questionable production value by their often outrageous plotlines and bizarre situations.  It can be something of a hit or miss proposition, which I think accurately reflects the selections on this MAFIA KINGPIN collection.

THE MASTER TOUCH is, I think, the best of these discs.  Take the average heist film and couple it with the fatalistic conventions of Greek Tragedy and you get something that may not be must-see theater, but certainly justifies the cost of this collection.  Kirk Douglas stars as a safecracker newly released from prison, but with a 'foolproof' plan for one final score to finance his retirement.  I've always liked Douglas' films, and this was solid as usual - plus, there is a nice change of venue as this was filmed in Hamburg.  Dated, yes, but still entertaining.  Four stars

VIOLENT NAPLES and THE CYNIC THE RAT AND FIST both star Maurizio Merli and John Saxon, and were both directed by Umberto Lenzi - probably back to back.  I was ambivalent about both films, though I give the edge to VIOLENT NAPLES for its stunning choreography of a helter-skelter motorcycle ride through Naples at rush hour.  Otherwise, the two films are very similar, with Merli kicking mob butt with nary a hair out of place.  Three stars each.

I was disappointed in THE COP IN BLUE JEANS - I thought I had heard good things about it, but it didn't live up to expectations.  Starring Tomas Milian and Jack Palance, and directed by Bruno Corbucci, it has Milian as an undercover cop who idolizes Serpico.  Half comedy, half drama, neither really worked for me.  Two-and-a-half stars.

MISTER SCARFACE is another Palance vehicle.  It's not bad, but I have it on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fernando-Di-Leo-Crime-Collection/dp/B004D8P23U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fernando Di Leo Crime Collection</a>&nbsp;(as RULERS OF THE CITY), and the transfer on the MAFIA KINGPIN collection is quite poor in comparison.  I only previewed the film to see what condition it was in.  Still, if you haven't seen it before, it may be the second best film - storywise - in the collection.

The DVD case lists THE COP IN BLUE JEANS and MISTER SCARFACE both as full screen and the others as wide screen - but that is only correct if you are watching on a standard, 4:3 television screen.  For those watching on widescreen TVs (16:9), both THE COP IN BLUE JEANS and MISTER SCARFACE are 1.33:1.  THE MASTER TOUCH is 1.77:1 (fullscreen).  THE CYNIC, THE RAT, AND THE FIST and VIOLENT NAPLES appear to be 1.85:1 (letterboxed).

There are no subtitles or special features, and the only audio is 2ch Dolby Digital.  The audio and transfers are average to good, and the films themselves average out to a mid-range rating.  As with other Pop Flix productions, this two-disc set is also marketed as a four-disc set with the same name.  It includes the contents of the two-disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Guns-Collection/dp/B002ID095S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Guns Collection</a>.  These two collections are coupled with the two-disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-Boss-Collection/dp/B002ID093U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime Boss Collection</a>&nbsp;to make one last six-disc set, also titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-Boss-Collection/dp/B003XUC6ZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime Boss Collection</a>.  (You can count on Pop Flix for making things confusing.)  Anyway, this last set is the set I would recommend, as you get all three sets cheaper than buying them individually - at least, that is, if you have any interest in Eurocrime films from the seventies.  If you are a casual fan, as I would consider myself, then I can easily recommend these inexpensive sets.  Those more dedicated to the genre may want to look at the output from Raro Video or Wild East Studios, which, from what I've seen do a great restoration job on these films, though consequently are forced to charge a premium for it.

I was a tad disappointed in this particular collection in comparison to other sets I've purchased from Pop Flix, though they have all been made up of average to good films.  I think in this case I had higher expectations, and they weren't quite met.  Three-and-a-half stars.",1354492800,4,4710,5.688125894134478
8408957,1,B003YCL13G,"The picture is washed out. The acting is stiff, and clumsy. It's terrible. The action scenes look awkward.

In short, it's a waste of money. I bought it on sale from the local Walmart. I gave it to charity after that.",1319673600,,217,4.2926829268292686
8408958,3,B003YCL13G,"I've bought virtually every Euro-thriller and Spaghetti western that Pop Flix has issued because some of the titles are difficult to locate and often come in the letterboxed format.  The ""Mafia Kingpin"" DVD collection advertises ""The Master Touch"" as a widescreen print, but it turned out to be Full screen when I played it on the Blu-Ray player. I checked ""Violent Naples"" and ""The Cynic, the Rat, and the Fist"" and both of them are in widescreen. I've been searching for a widescreen print of ""The Master Touch"" for years, but I haven't found one yet. I wasn't concerned about the other Jack Palance movies on the second disc. It is really a shame that ""The Master Touch"" was not presented in widescreen because the cinematography was done by ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" lenser Tonino delli Colli. If you're searching for a widescreen copy of ""The Master Touch"" don't make the same mistake that I made.  I am happy about ""Violent Naples"" and ""The Cynic, the Rat, and the Fist.""",1299888000,7,985,4.687861271676301
8408959,5,B003YCL13G,"A great collection featuring two excellent John Saxon films - The Cynic, The Rat and The Fist and Violent Naples (also starring Barry Sullivan). Rome Armed To The Teeth with Arthur Kennedy is the third film on disc 2. The star of all three is blonde leading man Maurizio Merli, who does a fine job all round. The supporting cast all turn in top performances and the U.S. performers all have their own voices, which is always a plus. All three films are excellent prints - wide screen and uncut.
Disc one features two full screen Jack Palance films - Mister Scarface and The Cop in Blue Jeans. These prints are just average, watchable if you are not fussy and Jack Palance has his own voice in both.
For my money disc two is the standout all-round. The price is also very good.",1257811200,12,776,4.433566433566433
