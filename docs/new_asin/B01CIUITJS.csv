7683369,1,B01CIUITJS,"I purchased this film because it has Joey Lawrence in it, who I think is a very underrated actor. He can take on a variety of roles and has never disappointed. His performance in this film is convincing too, however, the film itself is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Mostly because in my opinion it is Christian propaganda. Every other word is ""Lord"" or ""God"". Don't get me wrong, I do believe in God and think a movie about faith (or how faith can help you in your life) is a good idea but not if it's done the way this film is - very preachy. Also, the character Grace is not very likable. I don't know if it's the actress or the way the character was written but I didn't find her to be very pleasant. All in all, I only watched half of the movie, took the DVD out of the player and regretted investing the money in this.",1463270400,5,845,4.035714285714286

7683389,3,B01CIUITJS,"2.5 stars if I could have given them.  A weak formulaic plot, where the only surprise is that one of the characters asks for a ride home ""across town"" and seemingly lives in another state! Yet, they continued to walk, and in spite of warnings to the contrary, it never gets cold!  Christian movies can be so much better than this.  It was well acted apart from the pouting pre-pubescent who obviously needed his dad around to teach him how to throw.",1521849600,,449,4.451219512195122

7683401,3,B01CIUITJS,"I was expecting more from this movie, but it didn't deliver.  Joey Lawrence was very believable in his role of a grieving husband who couldn't get over the loss of his wife and shut himself off from his son.  Catalina Rodriguez, on the other hand, while being gorgeous, wasn't believable for me at all.  She lost her husband in the war, and her little boy met a tragic death, but she seemed quite flip about the whole thing.  Supposedly her faith in God helped her deal with this losses, but I've never met a mom who lost a child who could speak of it without losing it.  It's such a traumatic thing!  The ending is over-the-top happily ever after, but it couldn't make up for the rest of the movie for me.  Anyway, I'm glad I watched it on Prime before purchasing a copy.",1518825600,,772,4.319444444444445

Yes it's a slow moving story but in my opinion, does not do it any harm.  This movie is all about second chances at love and happiness and mending a broken heart.  I would watch this type of movie any day as opposed to watching left wing liberal actors like Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DeNiro, Sean Penn, Danny Glover, Barbra Streisand, Jane Fonda, ALEC BALDWIN (), The Sheens, Joy Behar, Whoopie Goldberg, Kerry Washington and that's just to name a few!",1497571200,,618,4.6422018348623855

7683447,3,B01CIUITJS,"I was really let down by this, if I'm being honest.  It seemed very low-budget for a Joe Lawrence project, and it moved very slowly.  I'm quite surprised that my husband didn't fall asleep during the film, actually.

Besides that, it was very far-fetched.  At the risk of giving away spoilers, if you can even call it that, I'll tell you that the girl he picks up on the side of the road actually comes off as a bit pushy throughout the entire film.  Basically, she asks for a ride to visit her family for Thanksgiving, no big deal in the grand scheme of things I guess, but there are so many stops along the way that it makes the movie unrealistic.  A couple of these stops even include places that, for some reason, just happened to be unlocked so they could sneak right in.  I know the premise is to believe that God planned this little adventure for His own divine purpose, but the unlocked doors were a little too much for me, and it distracted me from the movie.

I had trouble getting into it, and I often found myself saying ""yeah right, like that would really happen.""  The icing on the cake is how they fell in love after only one day, especially when he was supposedly so heart-broken over losing his wife.  Now I've seen movies where people fall in love over the span of day, but it's done in a way that at least makes it believable.  This was so not.

The best part of the movie was the first ten minutes when it shows what happened to the main character's wife, but the rest is all downhill from there.  That being said, I have always been and will always be a Joe Lawrence fan, so the three stars I managed to give this film were for his acting alone, sadly nothing else.  Glad I didn't pay fifteen or twenty dollars for this one.  :(",1496880000,,1749,4.257575757575758

7683472,2,B01CIUITJS,"I honestly was not a fan of this movie. I normally enjoy Christian movies, but there were many different times throughout the movie that I thought ""wow, inappropriate"". Example... them kissing on her dead husbands grave/dead sons grave at the end. I understand the connection between them due to their similar losses, but that just seemed way too ""seriously?!"" for me.
I felt that the movie went pretty slow. I noticed that the more adventures they took, the more I was thinking okay... time to wrap this up already.

The acting I thought was good! It was just the plot was too slow and some of the connective moments between the two of them seemed to come at the very worst of times. Which maybe is the point. I don't know. I haven't been in that situation but I do fairly strongly feel that if I were in that position, I'd have enough respect for my dead husband NOT to kiss the new guy I just met whilst on his grave.

7683485,5,B01CIUITJS,One of the better Christian movies I've seen to date.  A bit of fantasy.  A bit of over the top romance.  For those of us who truly believe that such things are possible - it is a wonderful movie.,1479254400,2,196,3.9743589743589745

7683489,3,B01CIUITJS,"Movie has a happy ending and the lead lady is excellent in her role.  The homeless man also does a good job in his role.  He and the lead woman have contagious smiles.  Faith and trusting God are stressed.
Most of the film moves very slowly, with an uninteresting plot.
Thus I don't recommend this movie.",1475884800,5,304,4.392857142857143

7683502,5,B01CIUITJS,"Saved By Grace has too much God & faith according to one review. That is probably true UNLESS you have lived long enough to see how God works through coincidences. Anyone who has lived several decades has faced loss. This film deals with LOSS and RECOVERY. The interplay & dialog between Rick and Grace is the movie. Lawrence plays the part of discouragement with gritty reality. Youll hear the words. Dont miss the gestures, facial expressions, etc. Grace is much too upbeat in loss, too able to keep the faith UNLESS you have lived with a woman who has demonstrated such optimism through 50 years of the hardships and triumphs of life. I have. Rick and Grace demonstrate the dance of life which ends in love. If you like action movies, don't bother. (Dont miss Joey in a different role in Hitched for the Holidays.)",1466380800,14,817,4.641379310344828
7683503,3,B01CIUITJS,When i saw the preview for this movie i thought it was going to be good but to be honest it wasn't that great. I'm not a fan of it.,1465603200,2,131,3.4
8753111,3,B01CIUITJS,"I LOVE Joey Lawrence, I LOVE Christian  movies,and I LOVE romance movies,buuuuttt im not too sure about this one. It was ok cause it was free on prime video,but the main actor Grace....anybody else get annoyed with her?. Lol she was sooooo pushy,nosey,and ruuude! Rude cause she snooped in his box& rude cause she kept making pit stops when this nice guy offered to take her accross town! Lol I dunno...she wasn't the greatest actor...Ive seen Joey's other chick flicks,and the leads are usually a little more believable.  Joey gave a solid performance as always though.

8753112,4,B01CIUITJS,"Mr. Lawrence has some serious dramatic chops that haven't been given enough time and material to truly showcase.  This movie was quite good.  There was some deep drama with a well-place chuckle here and there to keep it light and the story flowed nicely.  It was cut and edited very well.  The true highlights, however, were provided by Joe Lawrence in several scenes; before leaving the house at the beginning of the story, in the truck before he meets Grace and again in the truck just after he meets Grace.  Best of all was the scene in the empty dance studio.  I look forward to seeing more dramatic roles from Mr. Lawrence.  It will be worth it, and this movie is most definitely worth the time to watch and to purchase.  Happy viewing!",1535587200,,741,4.518796992481203
8753113,2,B01CIUITJS,"Doesn't deserve 4.5 . It just dragged on. That Grace chick appears out of nowhere, dragging a  to go home, miles away, and then dragging Joey around all over the place and then ends up at his mother's house, not hers.. Nothing throughout the movie tells you how does she know where his mother lived? Just didn't make any sense. I was expecting her to vanish, like an angel, once the assignment was over, but no, they become an item. Sorry, folks.. Spoiler alert. Waste of time and money.",1535587200,,487,4.47191011235955

8753120,1,B01CIUITJS,"A former cop (Ricky) drives past a woman (Grace) on the side of the road who asks him for help.  She talks nonstop about how excited she is to spend Thanksgiving with her family.  For what should be a 20-minute drive turns into an all-day affair because Grace makes him stop several times along the way.  They 'break in' to a school pool, a dance studio, and church.  There was no chemistry between these characters and the acting was so contrived and wooden it was all very nauseating; it even had a hint of a 'homeless angel' thrown in!  At the end of the film we learn there was no family dinner at all.  Grace wanted a ride to the cemetery and 'fell in love' on the way there!  Please.  This movie was so stupid I cannot even believe I wasted 1.5 hours watching the whole thing.
I watched it so you don't have to. :(",1531180800,3,820,4.211538461538462
