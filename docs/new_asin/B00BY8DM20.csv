5682164,3,B00BY8DM20,"I love Jack Benny's comedy.  The major problem with the film is, that like a lot of things is dated.  I hadn't seen it in years and some of the references and bits are a little old.  Some of it is good, not just quite as funny as I remembered it from seeing it on television 50 years ago.  Perhaps the fact that George M. Cohan wrote the story has something to do with ""age"" factor.",1383350400,,382,3.986842105263158
5682165,4,B00BY8DM20,"Good old Jack Benny comedy.  Made during the war.  I remembered it from seeing it in my youth, so it made some sort of lasting impression.  Upon seeing it now, much of the humor might be considered racist, but Rochester gave it to Benny even more than Benny gave it to Rochester.

I enjoyed it.  Definitely a B (budget) movie..",1376438400,5,327,4.383333333333334
5682166,3,B00BY8DM20,"It is fun to watch Jack Benny on screen, no matter what film it is.  This particular one isn't memorable, though.  Jack finds himself having to be a real meanie to everyone, hence the title of the film.  Not a total waste of time, but not something you'll want to watch a second time in one year.",1375660800,2,296,4.157894736842105
5682167,3,B00BY8DM20,"Some of my fondest memories as a kid was rushing home from school to watch repeats of ""The Jack Benny Program"" on UHF.  I loved Jack's deadpan delivery, his tightwad persona, and his supporting cast.  His influence would later be exhibited by performers like Johnny Carson and Bob Newhart.  This film disappointed me somewhat.  At a brief 57 minutes it seems a little stretched out.  Even at half the running time there's not enough material sufficient for a single episode of Jack's TV show.  Highlights of the film are the exchanges between Jack and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson.  Divorce those moments and your not really left with much.  Not a complete waste of time but not on the level of Jack's other screen ventures like ""Charley's Aunt"" or ""To Be or Not To Be"".",1370304000,8,768,4.7218045112781954
5682168,5,B00BY8DM20,"Writers George Seaton and Allan House rewrote this play to fit the comedic talents of the legendary Jack Benny. Benny plays a friendly lawyer with the image of being a tightwad.  Things are not going well in his professional or personal life. Benny is then convinced by his valet, Anderson, to become mean and uncaring and his business will become successful. Benny agrees and he becomes a financial success. But his girlfriend, played by the beautiful and talented Priscilla Lane, doesn't like the new personality and promptly dumps him. After a highly publicized photo of Benny taking candy from a baby he's dubbed ""The Meanest Man in the World"" by the New York City papers. Can Benny change his new found image?  Can he win the respect of the girl he loves?  Can he find his redemption? This is a Benny movie worthy of belonging to your collection.",1369699200,15,851,4.736486486486487
8575521,5,B00BY8DM20,"Great film! A comedy classic and a very impressive duo performance for Jack Benny and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson.

There are many hilarious situations and both comedians are in top form. True professionals and authentic friends, they complement each other sublimely!

This DVD-R release is very well restored with excellent audiovisual quality, it upscales pleasantly with a 4K Bluray player & TV.

Great fun and a happy purchase, I love it!",1525305600,,441,5.271428571428571

8575524,2,B00BY8DM20,"At 57 minutes, ""The Meanest Man In the World"" must be one of the shortest B+ movies ever made.  The film is a cheap exploitation of Jack Benny's radio reputation, pairing him with Rochester, his off-sider on the air.  He stars as a small time lawyer who is unable to make a buck because he is not tough enough with his clients. He wants to marry his fiance, played by the vivacious Priscilla Lane, but can not afford to. His future father-in-law packs him off to New York to get him away from his daughter. He is still unable to make a living until he turns mean and then he becomes swamped with publicity and work but it backfires when Lane no longer respects him. The outcome is perfunctory.

The film has some good lines and an amusing performance from Anne Revere as a sharp secretary.  Benny wears an obvious hair piece and has some romantic scenes but the film would be much funnier with Bob Hope to whom the screenplay would be better suited. In fact, I would say Benny is miscast.

The film is available in the Fox Archive Series which means it is expensive and bare bones. The print is adequate.",1451606400,,1104,4.392156862745098

8575528,3,B00BY8DM20,"""The Meanest Man In The World"" was a disappointment. The story resembled a perfunctory, bland radio program of the era--say, ""Father Knows Best."" Jack Benny's famous (but not all that bad) bomb, ""The Horn Blows At Midnight,"" was, in comparison, a masterpiece.",1408924800,,259,5.190476190476191
