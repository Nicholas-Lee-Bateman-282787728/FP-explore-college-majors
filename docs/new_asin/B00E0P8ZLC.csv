5883043,4,B00E0P8ZLC,"""My Father and the man in Black"" (2012 release; 88 min.) is a documentary written, produced and directed by Jonathan Holiff, the son of Saul Holiff. Saul was the manager of Johnny Cash for about 15 years (late 50s to early 70s).

As the documentary opens, we see a re-enactment of Saul's suicide in 2005, and Jonathan's subsequent obvious struggle with the passing of his dad, whom he barely had spoken to in the last 20 years apparently. As it happens, Saul left a true treasure trove of memorabilia from his entire career, including of course the golden years with Johnny Cash. Through the use of pictures, archive footage, and tons of reel tape with Saul's thoughts on everything (as well as taped telephone conversations--I wonder if the person on the other side of the line knew about that), Jonathan is able to paint a vivid picture of his dad's humble beginnings in Hollywood, only to eventually make it into ""the business"" as Johnny Cash's promotor and manager. The highlight of Saul's career is probably when he suggests June Carter as an additional act to Johnny's touring circus. The rest, as they say, is the stuff of legends.

Couple of comments: as mentioned already, there are a number of re-enactments in the movie, basicaly to provide an image to the multitudes of reel tape being used. I must say that the re-enactments didn't bother me at all. Second, the documentary of course focuses on Johnny Cash (for obvious commercial reasons), but the TRUE story of this documentary is how Jonathan is trying to find closure in the relationship with his dad. Why was his dad so angry and mean with Jonathan? Why did his dad commit suicide? All this eventually is answered in this documentary.

Bottom line: I was pleasantly surprised how well this documentary played out. No, this isn't an earth-shattering documentary along the lines of, say, that other  documentary I just saw, ""The Act of Killing"". If you are a die-hard Johnny Cash fan, you absolutely do not want to miss this. For the casual Cash fan such as myself, ""My Father and The Man in Black"" possesses enough charm and yes, entertainment, that the documentary flew by in no time. This documentary came out over a year ago in Canada, and it's just now finding its way into US theatres with a DVD release soon thereafter. Not sure why it's taken this long, but better late than never. Well worth checking out!",1377648000,15,2380,4.727710843373494

5883048,3,B00E0P8ZLC,"Jonathan Holiff is the son of Saul Holiff, who managed Johnny Cash for almost 20 years bringing Johnny from near obscurity to fame and fortune that had alluded him prior to his management by Holiff.  Relying on film clips, photographs and reel to reel audio tapes of Saul's verbal diary, we are introduced to the thinking of Saul Holiff.  Jonathan tries to unveil and dissect the man that he knew as father in name only.  His father like Johnny Cash was a hard drinker and daily used pills as well.  Holiff's day in day out dealings with a drug and alcohol addled superstar left him totally drained and removed from his role as husband and father.  In the end, his desire for control was so powerful that he chose when to die, without even leaving a note.  Thus his widow, who plays an almost non-existent role in this documentary, Joshua, his brother, (not included in the video) and Jonathan must some how move past this tragedy.

We are not informed why Joshua nor their mother do not participate in the film, perhaps, they own sorrow prevented them from doing so.  Jonathan presents to us primarily through the audio recordings made by his father, the summary of his father's life as it relates to Johnny and June Carter Cash (not much real detail, certainly not an expose of them that you haven't already been privy too through other sources); his frustrations when dealing with vendors who are angered by Johnny's last minute cancellations to music executives; and his anger due to his inability to properly parent.  Jonathan had a great deal of conflict with his father and was frequently told he was a disappointment but had no real understanding that this is typical in growing up in a home where substance abuse overshadows every aspect of life.

As a study, of a substance abusing household this is as accurate as any example, those who are adult children of alcohols (or addicts) will tell you.  As many children in this environment tend to do, Jonathan left home as early as possible running from his home in Canada to Hollywood to become a manager of stars just like his dad.

I liked that Jonathan doesn't play the victim in this movie.  Those survivor's of such homes must choose to walk in forgiveness and love or live their life tormented by the bitterness by all they missed because they didn't have a ""normal"" childhood.  Jonathan has obviously chosen to forgive as his understanding of his father increased.  It is an uncompromising look at the isolating pain, he experienced as he suffered ongoing rejection but never knew how to be acceptable.  This would puzzle any child.  However, that said, I felt he missed an opportunity to explore for the viewer how he overcame his pain of rejection or if he still struggles.  Further, I am so curious why the other family members only got a passing comment but never share the screen with him.

I thought this documentary was going to be more focused on Johnny Cash instead of using his name to entice you to watch a true story about a son whose father just happens to work for Johnny Cash but is absent physically and emotionally from his childhood.  I thought it was a story about his father and Johnny's Cash's partnership ""secrets to fame"" or something more to do with their work relationship than the mere fact that Johnny's addictions were part of the reason for Saul's absences.  I felt this usage of Johnny Cash is plain misleading and intentional and thus I deducted a star for that.

Furthermore, we only have a limited view of Jonathan's isolation, no one else is included in an interview format be it a relative, a girlfriend, neighbors, sibling or mother contribute their observations.  I am sure his mother had a great deal of her own pain having to parent two boys almost like a single mom at the hands of a verbally abusive husband (this is an assumption based on his treatment of Jonathan, little is mentioned about the parent's marital dynamics).  I do respect that this may have seemed to personal or invasive by his mother, it just wasn't touched on or it's lack of inclusion explained.

It was a fair job as a documentary, its limited point of view kept it from being exceptional.  Other title options might have been more accurate, ""A Look at Johnny Cash's manager, my Dad, Saul Holiff"" or ""A Look at Parental Substance Abuse impact on a Childhood"".",1426291200,,4336,4.6723684210526315

However, I don't know if I would recommend purchasing it, if you think it is about Johnny Cash and his father....The story is about Johnny Cash agent and promoter and his son, that is done very very well....Loving Johnny Cash I now understand how June Carter was instrumental for him to turn to the revival message and believe because of his conversation of being born again,,,he felt called to share the message of Jesus but,Hollywood and Capitol records, who he built their building, turned against him. I now believe JC dedicated his life to show the world what Jesus meant to him.",1401148800,2,882,4.764705882352941
5883052,3,B00E0P8ZLC,"I suppose this film would not exist had not Saul Holiff had a penchant for taping things -- i.e., a great many conversations with a troubled Johnny Cash and a great many soliloquies from a troubled Saul Holiff -- and had not Jonathan Holiff opened the storage unit where the tapes lay for many years.  I can well understand how Jonathan Holiff found irresistible the opportunity to utilize this material to tell the story of his father and Cash and their manager-artist relationship, and to reveal Saul Holiff's conflicted emotions vis-a-vis his career and his family.  Forgive my suspecting that some of the elder Holiff's ramblings were more self-serving than one might hope.

The resulting film includes well-cast recreations of scenes from Cash's life, but at 88 minutes, it seems to go on a bit longer than necessary.",1400716800,2,822,4.942028985507246

This could have easily come across bitchy and whiny. It just didn't. It leaves you with inspiration to grapple with your own relationship issues.

It was my husband`s too and I do not even know, how much I have CD-s with country music at my home. Never calculated. And of course Johnny Cash is one of my beloved singers. But this is not a story of Johnny ""foremost singing storyteller"" Cash. This is a story of a man, who stood behind him and maybe without him there would not be any Johnny Cash as we know him, a renown artist. It is always exciting to know, who stood behind an artist, was his back up and I guess that a quot of J. Cash "" I just want to be myself and for what I`m worth, I`m me."" is just a proper keyword to the story before there was Johnny and June, there was Johnny and Saul. Saul Holiff was his agent and manager, who gave his soul to Johnny, was living a quite caotic life and as a famous singer admits: "" We both know that You are much more a part of our lifes, that is told here. Thank You for living it with me.""  Saul wanted to be himself again, rebuild his self - respect, get his robbed soul back and that is why he got out this relationship, because he wanted it. So, the both of them wanted to be as they are and that was a reason of breaking off and driving them apart. And finally, this inside story has been told by the son of Saul Holiff, who is searching for his father in the shadow of a greatest icons and legend.",1386028800,,1396,3.9679715302491103
5883057,1,B00E0P8ZLC,"I must say that I am very disappointed with this documentary. Are the contents of it accurate? I have no way of knowing and really don't care. It is not what I thought I was purchasing. That I suppose is my fault in that I did not read the reviews prior to now.

I thought I was getting a positive documentary about Johnny Cash and his singing career. What I have is a one sided negative documentary by a disgruntled young man with an ax to grind. While I certainly do not believe Johnny Cash walked on water, and I don't recall him claiming to, I am reluctant to take the biased opinion of one with an obvious desire to degrade the reputation of a man he feels did his father an injustice.

Bottom line, it is not what I wanted, thought I was getting, or would recommend to others. The ""Man in Black"" is dead. He will answer to a higher one who knows the facts without bias. No legitimate purpose is served in further stepping on or kicking him down here.",1384300800,7,956,4.218579234972678

There's no exception with this documentary.  Touching story about how a son discovers his fathers works, and the fact that he did speak lovingly of the son to associates, namely, the man in black, we all know who that is, for legal reasons, his real name was not used.  I'm not sure I can honestly recommend this film for Cash fans, whoops, I said his name.  Perhaps the bonus 20 minutes would be worth the price.

5883062,5,B00E0P8ZLC,"Jonathan Holiff has courage. He has created a story about his own sense of isolation and loneliness and disregard by his father and unlike so many men who have had the same submerged life of regret, Jonathan Holiff has worked through his - through soul searching, agonizing recollections, the death of a father that was so distant, and through research that unearthed years of recorded tapes made by his father that explain many of the problems Jonathan never understood.

Jonathan Holiff's father, Saul Holiff, was Johnny Cash's personal manager from 1960 to 1973. This film is the untold story of 'bad-boy' Johnny Cash, his talented but troubled manager, Saul Holiff, and a son searching for his father in the shadow of a legend. But what the film delivers in a sophisticated approach to a documentary (mixing many clips of historic clips and conversations on tapes with live actors standing in for the featured characters of this tale) is another look at just who Johnny Cash really was - from a mediocre country singer to a drug addict and alcoholic to a wreck of a human being who failed to show up for concerts, to his gradual comeback via his unique recordings from prisons and then to his fall again as he became a radical fundamentalist born again Christian, through two marriages and a divorce, his fame with  June Carter Cash and his eventual death from complications of diabetes in 2003. Tat is not the Cash the public knows and the fact that he sustained the glow of fame is in large part due to the tireless efforts of Saul Holiff, himself an alcoholic and tormented man.

But at what costs? This film allows us to connect most closely with Jonathan Holiff as he comes to grips with the man who as his father was carrying on the tradition of emotional frigidity with his son. The young Holiff knows just how far to push the buttons and when to back off, and the end result is a very powerful film on so very many levels.

5883065,4,B00E0P8ZLC,"The question I ask and have not found the answer, is to the writer and star of the documentary, 'My Father And The Man In Black', Jonathan Holiff, ""Did you ever find what you were looking for?""

Jonathan Holiff narrates this documentary about his father, Saul Holiff, and ties it with Saul's relationship, personal and professional with Johnny Cash. Jonathan and his father, Saul, had a difficult relationship. While Jonathan was growing up his father was absent, on the road with Johnny Cash. When Saul was home, he was distant and verbally abusive , showing no warmth at all, ever. It was not until, Saul committed suicide , and Jonathan was looking for answers that he found a room full of documents, audio recordings, letters, pictures and some video about and from his father.

What this documentary does give us is a perspective on crucial moments in Johnny Cash's career. Saul was there from the beginning. He grew up in Canada and then went off to find his fortune. He ran into Johnny Cash at the very beginning of his career and became Cash's manager. This was not an easy feat, as Johnny Cash began to fall into the deep abyss of drugs and alcohol. Saul became the 'fixer' of all problems, all the while his wife and two sons were living the best they could all alone. Johnny Cash found sobriety and then religion, and it was during this time that Johnny Cash's career began to falter. Saul could no longer find the kind of venues, with the big money that Johnny Cash wanted. Eventually Saul handed in his resignation and ended his time with Johnny. He went on to obtain a college degree, and tried to spend time with his family. However, this was not a good time and Jonathan and Saul became estranged and never saw each other again.

Jonathan went looking for answers, but I am not sure he found them. A cold, aloof father who was following in his own father's footsteps. We know Jonathan's brother has become the kind of father he always wanted, but we don't know about Jonathan.

I found the dramatic reincarnation of events did not fit well with this documentary. The audio recordings, the letters and tape and videos did supply a sense of what life was like with Saul and Johnny Cash. I hope both men were the better because of their relationship. I was given this DVD for review.

With that being said, we were incredibly skeptical about seeing ""My Father and the Man In Black."" We watched it together and all came to a consensus: This is a great movie that reveals so much about Cash, his manager, and June Carter that has never been revealed to the public before. It's production value is exquisite, and I especially enjoyed the reenactments that put you right there as things were unfolding. But what really makes it shine is just how much new information is in here. I came away from it feeling like I had known Johnny Cash personally. It was that in-depth.

5883068,5,B00E0P8ZLC,"Johnny Cash is ,and will continue to be, one of the greatest legends in American Music. I have been a diehard fan of his since the 50's. He was so many things to his fans,his family,and even himself. Over the years we saw so many different faces or sides to him. In fact,he was many different people ,that kept changing throughout his long musical career. Throughout those great changes,the one thing that remained the same was that he was always true to himself and his values. In other words,it didn't matter if it was the days when he fought demons,visited Folsom Prison,performed on stage,or in his TV Show,his trips abroad in Israel or Ireland,sang alone or with June,the Outlaws or others,and in his later years with completely different and original music;Johnny Cash was always Johnny Cash.
 This documentry is something different and will be very informative to anyone who has loved Cash and really wants to get a feel as to what he was really like.
No better way than to see the relationship between Cash and Saul Holiff,his manager and friend for over 15 years. It is very enlightening to see how close this relationship really was and that it became all encompassing;so much so,that Holiff even gave up his body and soul for Cash;and actually even neglected his family and son in the process. It shows us the great struggle and sacrifice that the Legends in the entertainment world actually make during their careers. I remember a Johnny Cash performance several years ago  here in Toronto. June was with him as well as John Carter Cash,who was a teenager at the time. He mentioned that his was a great responsibility,in that there were at least 25 families who depended on him. This dependence and and love is clearly demonstrated throughout this documentary.
 I guess the most surprising thing I learned was that of all the friends and associates that Cash knew and worked with,mainly in the American Country Music world,that his manager for many years was a Canadian from London Ontario and was Jewish. Then again ,I really shouldn't have been ,particularly after his success in later years working with Rick Rubin.
 I really can't say enough about this documentary;but I know I'll be returning to watch it again,and again;and read the wonderful Reviews already posted,and the many more that will be written as it becomes well known. There is no doubt that it will be enjoyed and treasured by all of Cash's fans and would also be a moving and interesting movie. If anything,I wish it had been longer than 1 Hr and 25 minutes. More of Cash's songs could be included as well as more footage and photos of Cash and Holiff ,from the treasure trove found in the London locker would be appreciated. Somehow,the thought came to me ,that wouldn't it be interesting to be a mouse in the corner when this documentary was being watched by Johnny,June,John Carter,and Saul and his son Jonathan?
 Thanks Jonathan ,for sharing this with all of Cash's fans.",1379721600,2,2957,4.801571709233792
5883069,5,B00E0P8ZLC,"Coming as I do from a long line of Johnny Cash devotees, I've always been suspicious of anything promising a look at ""Johnny Cash as you've never seen him before."" ""My Father and the Man in Black"" is one of the few pieces of Cash historiography to actually earn that tagline. The film's focus on the intertwining lives of Johnny, June, and manager Saul Holiff makes it a refreshing take on some familiar material. Director Jonathan Holiff, Saul's son, reconstructs the story from previously unheard audio in his father's possession; actors' reenactments are used to add a visual element to the taped conversations. The mysterious ""Man in Black"" has never seemed so accessible as he does in this film, seen from the perspective of one of the men who knew him best.

The resentment Johnathan felt after a life of emotional estrangement from his dad is tempered as he discovers the interminable pressure inflicted on Saul by the erratic, reckless behavior of Cash.

5883071,5,B00E0P8ZLC,"As the title indicates, Jonathan Holiff has produced what is a very fine documentary of his father Saul Holiff, long time manager of Johnny  Cash, and his often rocky relationship with the country singer.  It is doubtful that either of these men would have accomplished what they did without the other. After his father's suicide on March 17, 2005, Mr. Holiff discovered a treasure trove of information including tapes and other records that his father had preserved in a locked storage space. He has done a terrific job in putting together this documentary using the information he gleaned from that discovery as well still photographs, old live footage of both Cash and the elder Holiff, tapes of these men's voices, re-enactments and music.

The result speaks for itself. The CD is both informative and objective. Mr. Holiff holds up a mirror to Cash, his wife June Carter and Holiff and makes no attempt to present anything but the unvarnished facts about  what happened: the time from 1958 when Holiff and Cash met, through their long business relationship, Cash's performances in San Quentin, the Johnny Cash television show in the 1970`s, Cash's trip to Israel, his producing of ""The Gospel Road,"" his conversion to fundamentalist Christianity and baptism in the River Jordan, Holiff resigning as Cash's manager, his then achieving his dream of getting a college degree, Columbia Records dropping Cash in 1986, Holiff's depression and suicide, and of course, both men's reliance on alcohol and drugs. Jonathan Holiff unflinchingly covers it all. At one point Cash says that he had gone through 100 pills and a case of beer in a day, noting that some men have died having abused fewer drugs in the same time period.  In another scene June Carter chastises Holiff  because he has given less than an enthusiastic response I believe to the Cash production of ""The Gospel Road."" (June played Mary Magdalene and Cash cast Holiff as Titus in the film.) She accuses him of  only being  interested in money. Holiff responds by saying that she is  being anti-Semitic.

What is most unsettling about this documentary is the relationship or lack thereof that Saul Holiff had with his two sons Jonathan and Joel. The elder Holiff at one point opines that  when we express love that we are being an exhibitionist and phony.  Every child deserves better.

Fans of Johnny Cash and those interested in the inner workings of the music industry  as well as anyone wishing to view the lives of two extremely talented but flawed human beings--there but by the grace of God go all of us-- will be moved by this CD.",1378857600,7,2599,4.877272727272727
