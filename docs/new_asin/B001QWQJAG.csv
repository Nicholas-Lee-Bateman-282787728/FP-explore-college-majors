3771327,2,B001QWQJAG,"Did not watch all of it, very bad acting.  Looks like a home made movie?  Should have been R with language.",1373587200,,107,4.0476190476190474
3771328,5,B001QWQJAG,"This is an action packed Western, with less swearing, and better acting.  Bob Handigan plays a good role in this movie, and after seeing it--I know you won't be disappointed. This movie is a cross between HIGH NOON and TOMBSTONE.",1337212800,,229,4.725
3771329,1,B001QWQJAG,"claims to be another classic ... well it aint going to happen...
actors.. they aint.. sound quality isn't there lacks a lot of luster ..
the director must have been asleep during the making of the picture... if u want to call it that ... this is  a film ... that should not have been made ..save ur money .. there is better films out there than this....",1302393600,,353,4.1911764705882355
3771330,1,B001QWQJAG,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is nothing more than a home movie with a family of amateurs as the cast. The acting is horrible - totally unbelievable. the plot is not much better. I fast forwarded through most of it to see if there was anything worth watching.
Do not waste your money on this movie.",1299888000,2,313,4.147540983606557
3771331,1,B001QWQJAG,"After watching half of it I did turn it OFF.
I have one word for it as what Leonard Maltin says in his classification's
for the bottom of the barrel movies-He does not give them even one star, It is not worth even one star from me.
Wasted my time and money.",1296086400,,257,3.9615384615384617
3771332,3,B001QWQJAG,"Considering that this is a very small time production it is not bad, not great but not bad.  Some of the dialog is cheesy as well as the acting.  But all in all not a bad movie.  Also, I know the star Bob Handigan, we go way back, Bob would be so good in a comedy.  I had a hard time taking him serious, cause he rarely is.  It is worth a watch.",1242864000,,345,3.671232876712329
3771333,5,B001QWQJAG,"I was very impressed with the final edit done by Barnholtz Entertainment.  The film is now down to 93 minutes and flows much faster now.  Also check out this review by Fitz at blogcritics.org:

3771347,1,B001QWQJAG,So poorly made and acted.  We laughed at serious parts because of the way actors were projecting their lines.  Like an elementary school production.,1453507200,,148,5.125

3771354,3,B001QWQJAG,Modern day made movie.  Acting was just so so.  Not much of a story. Matter of fact I it did not impress me enough to remember what it was about.,1446681600,,145,3.8

3771366,2,B001QWQJAG,"This is an olde fashioned horse opera set in a cardboard, plywood, movie set painted out to be real with a certain videoographic backdrop attempting to fool the viewer into thinking ~ this is authentic! When it is painfully obvious this was a low budget film with unknown actors!",1436486400,,279,4.714285714285714
3771367,1,B001QWQJAG,I normally don't review movies. I watch pretty much anything. This one I couldn't figure out if it was meant to be deliberately bad or not. The acting was very melodramatic. The dialog was very wooden and poor. The music was over the top.  I've seen high school plays much better than this. Bad? Almost bad enough to be funny good. Fortunately an hour into the movie they started using split screens that way the pain was shortened. Too bad they didn't use it all the way to the end. Im just curious where they got the actors? Did they get paid?,1436054400,2,545,4.3431372549019605
3771368,1,B001QWQJAG,Terrible acting. Worse than the spaghetti westerns of the 1970s,1435276800,,63,5.4

3771390,1,B001QWQJAG,"If you like the old time westerns, you will not like this. It was poorly written in my opinion. It looks like it was done by high school students trying to get extra credit! The acting just wasn't believable.  My husband and I could not watch the whole movie. It was boring",1402531200,,273,4.25
3771391,1,B001QWQJAG,"I couldn't handle the slow, poorly acted story of this movie.  I made it through 1/2 of it before I called it quits.  Normally, I persevere through but I just couldn't stomach this one.",1402099200,,185,4.411764705882353
3771392,1,B001QWQJAG,Tried to watch it but couldn't get past the first 5 minutes. Even fast forwarded to see if it would get better - it didn't. Horrible acting and looks like it was shot with home video equipment.,1402012800,,193,4.243243243243243
3771393,1,B001QWQJAG,"I agree with the other reviewers that the acting was elementary, like grade school acting.  Very wooden in delivery.  The other criticism that I have is the dialog.  The only good thing about this movie are 1) makes your appreciate good acting, and 2) good screen play, two thing that this movie lacks.",1401753600,,302,4.660377358490566
3771394,5,B001QWQJAG,It was a really entertaining move about family and values about being lost amd then found Bob Handegan played a good roll o have watched the movie several timr and would watch it over again,1401235200,,189,4.428571428571429
3771395,1,B001QWQJAG,Couldn't get past the first 20 minutes due to some of the worst acting and directing I think I've ever seen.  No wonder I never heard of this movie (and I see most of the good movies at the theatre when they come out).,1399939200,,218,3.9545454545454546
3771396,1,B001QWQJAG,"I would classify this movie as being barely ""ok'.  I was tempted a couple of times to just cut it off and do something else, but continued watching it in hopes that it would improve.  The acting is basically at an amateur level.",1399766400,,228,4.27906976744186
3771397,4,B001QWQJAG,"This is a good western because it has all the earmarks of adventure, violence and fun.  The sheriff is not someone you want to fool with and it has a twist in the end which you will like.  Thanks for having a bunch of westerns.",1398729600,,227,4.022222222222222
3771398,1,B001QWQJAG,I would give it a minus 5 if I could. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. Not worth watching. I quit right away.,1395360000,,126,3.5357142857142856
3771399,1,B001QWQJAG,Acting and production appeared to have been done by amateurs.  How can you screw up bad guy vs good guy?,1394755200,,104,4.2
3771400,2,B001QWQJAG,Good storyline. But very predictable. Poorly acted. If you want to see a good western watch Open Range. One of the best modern Westerns I've ever seen.,1392595200,,151,4.62962962962963
3771401,3,B001QWQJAG,"Interesting story concept but acting not up to par. Photography and scenery was good, but production clearly puts movie in B category(or lower).",1388620800,4,144,5.304347826086956
3771402,2,B001QWQJAG,How is this in the tradition of Dances With Wolves? I didn't get past the first twenty frames of predictable lines and watching actors act.,1380585600,,139,4.6
3771403,1,B001QWQJAG,Bad acting. I was not able to watch even half of it. I will not recommend this movie to my friends.,1375488000,2,99,3.761904761904762
8336728,5,B001QWQJAG,enjoyed this movie as it took place here in area where i live.,1522540800,,62,3.8461538461538463
8336729,4,B001QWQJAG,Filmed in my home town and it will be a good gift for my sister who also left,1513814400,,77,3.3333333333333335
8336730,1,B001QWQJAG,"I really enjoy westerns, and have for years. This one was bad. Didn't watch it all. That says something.",1472428800,,104,4.526315789473684

8336734,5,B001QWQJAG,Great western.,1466121600,,14,6.5
8336735,4,B001QWQJAG,I don't watch these movies because I want an award winning show I watch then for entertainment on a lazy after noon. Yes some of the acting is poor but the story line was good and of course it's low budget that doesn't make it bad.,1465862400,,231,4.043478260869565
8336736,4,B001QWQJAG,This is a good old-fashioned Western movie. Lots of action.,1465257600,,59,5.0
8336737,3,B001QWQJAG,"What a turkey. This was a low budget or let's make a western in half an afternoon. The family that acts together stays together: I counted 6 Conovers in the credits and at least 2 more families in it,too.",1464739200,,204,4.256410256410256
