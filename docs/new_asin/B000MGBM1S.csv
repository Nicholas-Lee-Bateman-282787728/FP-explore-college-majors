2730728,5,B000MGBM1S,"The Gallagher family is like some horrible traffic accident. Part of you wants to turn away, but part of you must watch. Their moral code is that you look out for those who look out for you - family, friends, maybe some neighbors. But when it comes to strangers, institutions, and society as a whole - anything goes. Lie, cheat, steal, do anything you can get away with. If this reflects the state of American morality today, it's a small wonder that so many things seem to be coming apart.

An old Italian proverb oft quoted by Gerald Celente states: A fish rots from the head down. For decades the American elite have been openly amoral in the pursuit of wealth without regard to law or morality. (And unlike us, they can break the law with impunity) It's clear they feel no obligation to the general social good. They send our jobs abroad and bring in low wage illegals to impoverish the American working class. We hear the lies, and empty rhetoric of self-serving hypocrites, Luciferian narcotics and child trafficking pedophiles like the Clinton, Obama, and Bush families. Yes, the head is rotten; the head needs to be cut off.",1513728000,,1132,4.66

2730903,1,B000MGBM1S,"For anyone who grew up in a family, or knew a family like this, then you will remember that alcoholism and overt sexuality are the norm. While certainly there are moments that are funny and very true to life, the over the top glamorizing seem to be geared toward an audience that wants to live vicariously through other peoples dysfunctional lives. I suppose this is true of all reality programming but this episode failed, in my opinion, to link a broader story of family, hope or in lessons of life (not to mention in comedy), to make it worth watching further.

2730973,5,B000MGBM1S,"I wanted to see the original. It took some getting used to seeing different versions of all the characters I'm used to seeing on the American version, but now I'm hooked on both. I always find myself curious about how the cast and crew of each show would compare or contrast the two versions. Does David Threlfall feel ripped off by William H. Macy? They each bring their own unique perspective to the character of Frank. I think Macy's is a bit more dynamic, but Threlfall's Frank Gallagher is more forgiveable and sometimes even sympathetic. He's not quite as much of a total dirtbag as his American counterpart. In a lot of ways the American version of the show has pushed the boundaries and taken the story in a lot of directions that the original never really began to touch on. But when you start with an idea that's already been done, you have to build on it and maybe go a step or two further in order to make something new and unique as opposed to just a knock off. The Brits deserve credit for bringing the story to life in the first place for Showtime to start with. It would be interesting to know what each character thinks of their counterpart though. And one last thing: If I go to the American Shameless here on Amazon, will I find more reviews for the UK series? All the ones here seem to be for that one. Why don't people know what show they're reviewing before they post stuff?",1482537600,3,1396,4.3938223938223935

2731148,4,B000MGBM1S,"Well, if you happened to be looking for the most uncouth, tasteless, iconoclastic, warped, twisted, unapologetic situation comedy on the market.....YOU FOUND IT!!!  This is a series that pokes fun @ alcoholics, dysfunctional families & poor people (not necessarily in that order).  Meet the Gallaghers:  once you are drawn into their humble home, you'll never bee the same again!!

Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy) is a prototype deadbeat dad.  No, he's more than that.  If there were an award for ""world's worst dad,"" Frank Gallagher would doubtlessly win.  He has custody of his children (sort of) as his ex wife (Monica) is estranged.  However, Frank Gallagher doing his familial duty is about as common as a Labrador singing Verdi opera.  Frank is a drunk & puts more effort into trying to ""game the system"" of getting disability checks than he does into simply making an honest living.

Fiona (Emmy Rossum) is the catalyst of the show.  She is by far the most likeable character & the one we empathize with the most.  As the eldest daughter, she has taken it upon herself to take on the duties of being the surrogate mother of her younger siblings.  She is often frustrated & overwhelmed with the tasks life has dealt her, but she still finds a way to face each & every day with her winning smile.  Unlike her father, she works odd jobs & does her best to support the rest of her family.

Laura Slade Wiggins (Karen)  delivers a command performance as the girl-next-door who is caught in the body of teenage girl with an overactive libido.  Full confession:  Laura Slade Wiggins has ""got the goods.""  She is built like a cheerleader and she's the type of woman whom guys like me dream of taking to the mall.  Her acting talents outstrip this role;  I look forward to seeing more of her.  For now, all I can say is....WOW!!!

Somewhat surprisingly, as raucous as this show is, it still finds a way to have some rather poignant, heart wrenching moments.  While most of it is obnoxious humor, the fact that these moments exist in the series is profound.  So, bottom line is, if you're looking for an off-the-wall adventure in Chicago, the Gallaghers would be elated to invite you over to their house.  Be sure to accept the invitation!  8-)",1477958400,,2243,4.684615384615385

2731256,5,B000MGBM1S,"I haven't loved a series this much since being hooked on Breaking Bad! It's a wild and crazy ride through the life and times of the very dysfunctional Gallagher family. Covers all kinds of drama: poverty, crime, addiction, mental illness, promiscuity, poor parenting, education system failure, homosexuality, disability, illicit sex etc etc in a very darkly comedic way. Sometimes it's just zany. Other times it's truly heartbreaking.  The writers really nailed this one, in my opinion.  Under all the wicked humor there is some seriously raw truth and honesty here.

There is a lot of graphic sex and the show is very queer-friendly. Gays, lesbians, bisexuals, trans all get some air time, which was very cool to see. Though the male gay characters get the really developed threads. Yet no one is spared a good beat down and heavy drama. No one. If it's something scandalous, taboo, and offensive this show will cover it and mock it!

I did try and watch the original British version, but I just preferred our USA rendition. I don't care if it's not the original.  The storylines here are more developed and I just liked the characters more.",1474761600,,1142,4.865979381443299

Some viewers would probably find this show rather offensive, but those with open minds will find a show that portrays a family that although truly dysfunctional, find a way to endure their narcissistic, alcoholic fathers antics. They find love and support through each other and various quirky friends and neighbors. The characters are awesome! A big thumbs up to Joan Cusack for her portrayal of Sheila, a woman trying to overcome acrophobia, among the other phobias that plague her life.
Truly entertaining and hilarious at times.

2731937,5,B000MGBM1S,"Great show.  Just got through watching season 1 twice.  Just ordered season 2, can't wait to see it.

Frank is a jerk but a great one.  Fiona she holds them together.  Carl, the deviant little guy. Debbie, she's trying to be normal but she has her times.  Liam, he's Liam.  That brings me to Lip and Ian.  You can tall that they both love everyone in their family (Fank mite be the exception) but there's that bound between the two of them.  I loved the scene of the two of them in the van talking talking about Ian being being Ian. (Don't want to give it away)  Lip going to van told Ian that they we're cool after the fight the night before.

If you want to know, Ian and Lip are my two favorites, but I love them all.  Ian struggles about who he is reminds me of me.  And I think it's great how Lip sticks with him.

It is not for the prude to watch so if you are one don't watch.  A great show like I said.  As soon as I finish season two I'll order season three.

Wish I could put my thoughts about how much I love this show in the words of one of Franks rance, but it would get censored.  If you don't know what I'm talking about and Ian being Ian, buy the first season and find out.",1441756800,,1189,3.9451476793248945
2731938,4,B000MGBM1S,"Most of time, when people try to remake British television shows in the U.S., they don't work because of all the cultural difference. This has always been the case with two exceptions, The Office and Shameless. For those who think that Seinfeld is the only show about nothing, they've never seen Shameless. That show followed the day to day antics of four friends in New York City. This show follows the day to day antics of a deranged family living in Chicago.

In a Emmy winning role, William H. Macy stars as Frank Gallagher, an alcoholic man with six kids, who will do absolutely anything to get money without having to work for it. Frank's antics are really something to see, but as with most of the shows story lines, there is an underlying sadness to the whole thing. Deep down Frank cares deeply for his family and wants to change, but every time he appears to turn a corner, things just seem to get screwed up.

Frank's opposite is his daughter Fiona, played admirably by Emily Rossum. This being a comedy show and her not being very funny, has cost her the acclaim that Macy has received, but she is every bit as important to the story, as she's the one whose put her life on hold to raise her brothers and sisters.

The other stand out in the show is Cameron Monaghan, who on top of being part of a dysfunctional family, is also dealing with being a gay teenager in a traditional Irish family. He too has his funny moments, but is also the character, that most people can relate to on the show, not because he's gay, but rather he's in a place that he feels he doesn't really belong. He knows for as much as he loved, he will always be seen as different.

The lack of a solid story line most certainly effects the show, as most developments only last a couple of episode, but even after five seasons, the antics and scheming of the Gallagher family hasn't gotten old. For me one of the best parts about Shameless is seeing the characters develop and change over the years. When the show started, most of the cast were just kids, trying to find their way without any adult role models. They learn and grow as they go and to me that's more interesting and important than all the odd ball schemes and dirty words.

Shameless is unique in that the focus, direction, and characters are always changing. This is great for fans who are into the show, but it also makes it very difficult for people who are trying to get into the story. With so many things happening in such a short period of time to nearly a dozen characters, it is almost impossible, to figure out what lead up to what your watching, if you haven't seen it from the beginning.

Overall this show is hilarious, but has an underlying sadness to it. Everyone can related to at least one character, and we all know at least one family that's forced to live this way. We feel for them, but at the same time we are laughing voraciously and are thoroughly entertained by the antics of the entire Gallagher family.",1441497600,,2978,4.425182481751825

2731952,5,B000MGBM1S,"I remember waiting for the first season of Shameless to start. I was so completely excited about it: Great cast playing compelling, unique characters on a channel that has run several shows that I've loved. And thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.

The premise of the show is that the Gallagher family is struggling to make ends meet. Fionathe oldest Gallagher and caretaker to her numerous siblingsis played by Emmy Rossum with applomb. William H. Macy as Frank Gallagher, the alcoholic who's more than willing to throw his family under the bus if it gets him another beer, is another standout; he personifies the character that you love to hate. Each of the other Gallagher children are compelling in their own ways, from Lip the prodigy to Ian with his secret same-sex trysts to Debbie as a Fiona-in-training, even Carl and Liam earn and deserve their screentime. Justin Chatwin's Steve/Jimmy is a nice balance to Fiona's neuroticism and isn't bad to look at either. My favorite character might be Sheila, the agoraphobia and unlikely girlfriend to Frank played by Joan Cusack. Of course, Kev and Vthe mixed-race couple who lives next door to the Gallagher clanare also very entertaining.

By now, the show has several seasons under its belt, but I maintain that the first season was the best. It gives you a great introduction to the characters, their personalities, and the atmosphere of the show. I've not seen the original UK version of the show, but the US version has to at least give it a run for its money. If you like comedy and drama, like the idea of watching underdogs trying to rise above, and appreciate great acting and writing, then Shameless is for you. At the very least, you'll be entertained and feel proud of your own life and accomplishments.",1437004800,7,1765,4.841059602649007
2731953,5,B000MGBM1S,"Its raw portrayal of family is not for everyone, and there is too much nudity, sex, violence and foul language for me to be comfortable watching with my age-appropriate teens, but I do love Shameless.

2731955,5,B000MGBM1S,"I love this show. The story lines are well written, often extremely funny and very inventive compared to most other shows out there. All the central characters comes across as real human beings that you care about and love - and sometimes hate.... At times the show can get pretty outrageous, in fact pretty (ahem) shameless, but rarely goes too far in my opinion. The writers have managed to find a balance between humor / seriousness that works really well. And Emmy Rossum is fantastic - and gorgeous - in her role as Fiona Gallagher, for me her character is the true heart of ""Shameless"". The Gallagher family is like no other family on TV!

I highly recommend ""Shameless"". Seasons 1-4 have all been very, very good.  Looking forward to season 5 :)",1436313600,,752,4.646616541353383

I like dark comedy, but I was waiting for the ""comedy"" comedy, as my friend had repeatedly told me.  I should give my friend zero-stars.  Now that I know what to expect, I will watch it again.

There is romance and drama without purple prose. The comedy is meticulously-crafted; stemming from razor-sharp writing and fueled by the impeccable delivery from the show's stellar cast. Its engaging and sexy without being hackneyed; hilarious and shocking without being low-brow.

It's realistic and emotionally driven with comedic undertones. This thing I enjoy the most about this show is how well they have developed the characters. They haven't done what some shows do and that's put characters in situations that they'd never be in or react in ways that character would never react as. It's completely and utterly shocking how beautiful this show is.,1413590400,3,532,4.793478260869565

It is so nice to be able to understand all the connections among the group. There are cast comments that have been interesting. The sex and the dialogue can be quite explicit. The working class family doesn't have money to burn but they do have each other and desire for each to triumph over the conditions that surround them. It is fast paced and the dialog is witty  Having the first three seasons doesn't feel like enough.  Money well spent.,1396915200,,591,4.453703703703703

2732385,5,B000MGBM1S,"I start this by saying if you are a person that offends easily this show will probably not be for you. With that being said, it is a show that shows you the real life struggles that families go through. At the same time it shows how you can make the best of a bad situation and get through anything with a loving family by your side. The Gallagher's do get in some odd predicaments but always stick by each other side by side. One of the best things about this show is the fact that it is a show for ADULTS. It has adult issues, some nudity, profanity. People often give this show a bad rap but if that is what ratings are for when it comes on television it is rated TV MA for a reason. To some, it has a slow start to the series but if you stick through you will think its worth it.",1393113600,,783,3.930817610062893

I judge good shows against Breaking Bad and Dexter (which probably isn't very fair), anyway I gave this a shot and it was fantastic, funny, sad, and just plain hilarious. It's not as good as Dexter and BB, but it's almost as good. Give it a try. I bought season 1 used here on Amazon just to see if I was going to like it. Well I loved it and then promptly bought seasons 2 and 3. The second and third seasons are even better than season 1. Give this a try, you will love it.",1392768000,2,518,3.942857142857143

After watching just a few minutes of a random episode, I WAS HOOKED!! Unfortunately, it was a busy weekend, so I couldn't drop everything and watch all episodes back-to-back as I desperately wanted to! Anytime I had a few spare minutes, I'd quickly turn it on! I didn't know the characters, didn't know the storyline, but it didn't matter! The series is so well-written!  It's funny, dramatic, shocking, happy, sad...it keeps you on your toes and longing for MORE!!  The show deals with real life social problems of families in the lower economic class trying to thrive & survive! Although the Gallagher clan is one of the most dysfunctional families ever, they all love one-another so much. Their strong bond is what holds them together and gives them hope for a better tomorrow! I love this family!
I'm currently watching Season 4 on Showtime, while catching up with seasons 1-3! I knew that the Shameless series would be one that I watched over and over; therefore, I knew I must own each season on DVD! My Prime membership enabled me to receive the DVD's in two days! Included on each DVD is deleted scenes and interesting commentaries! Thanks, Amazon!!",1392681600,,1319,4.857777777777778
2732419,5,B000MGBM1S,"I am not sure if this falls into the category of 'black' comedy however the characters are very Shameless as they will do ANYTHING.  The dad is a drunk and has no limits on how he will acquire the money he needs to keep drinking.  The lead female, Fiona his oldest daughter, keeps the family together while falling into the sack with a lot of guys.  There is a lot of T & A here too.  Even with all of this, it is a well told tale of a south side Chicago family trying to make ends meet.  You will laugh, you will be disgusted, you will very sorry for them, you will feel their happiness and you will get caught up in their lives.  After finishing season 1 I ordered seasons 2 and 3 and cannot wait to see what happens in season 4.",1392595200,2,731,4.006896551724138
2732420,5,B000MGBM1S,This show is amazingly dysfunctional!  Every character has some type of flaw but at the end of the day they all support one another! Best show!,1392595200,,143,4.5
2732421,5,B000MGBM1S,how could you go wrong with shameless? every season is spectacular.....love it love it love it love it love it,1392422400,,110,4.55
2732422,1,B000MGBM1S,"The way this show consistently depicts violence, drug use, prostitution, pre-adolescent sexuality, sodomy and the sodomite as normal and routine, even banal, elements in the tapestry of ""enlightened"" modern urban life is appalling and repulsive. As a kind of dystopic ethnography, however, Shameless remains instructive, managing the seemingly impossible feat of squeezing into each episode, if only in the smallest measure, every form of human degeneracy and vice imaginable; offering the viewer a very vivid cross-sectional glance of a sick, depraved culture--not too distant from our own today--that is the inevitable result of the subversion of traditional social norms by the the basest human instincts, and where the untrammeled forces of greed, lust, fornication, and violence are given free rein. The writers of Shameless, in seeking to titillate and shock a morally jaded audience (comprised predominantly of corrupt teens and thirty something Gen X-ers) through a calculated (and tritely predictable) recurrence to gratuitous displays of amoral sexuality and violence, demonstrate not only a crass cynicism and intense contempt for the sensibilities of their viewers, but in some measure also set in sharp relief the misery and absurdity that is the inevitable issue of a philosophy of life which has adopted as its guiding ethic the nihilistic imperative to ""do what one pleases when one pleases"", a stark hallmark of every exhausted, decaying culture, from Roman times up to our own.

Moreover, in contrast to the ethnic and racial pluralism conspicuously on display in every layer of the show's heterogeneous, episodic structure, it is interesting to note that no less than THREE OUT OF SEVEN of the writers of Shameless are ethnically Jewish. Should this surprise us? that the ethnic group most active in the production and dissemination of hard core porn in America and abroad, should figure disproportionately in the writing of what is arguably the raunchiest, most unabashedly pornographic mainstream serially produced show in the history of television entertainment? That the long procession of anti-white tropes neatly woven into every story line, in which whites are cartoonishly portrayed as either ridiculous patronizing bigots or cynical guttersnipes more than willing to cash in on ""white privilege"" should the need arise; in which  young white women are shiftless criminal offenders and non-whites their innocent victims; in which snow white Christian Bibles are set ablaze and ethnic Russians, historically the great hobgoblins of the largely Eastern European Jewish diaspora, are all corrupt racketeers and prostitutes, a slander that would no doubt elicit howls of protest from organized Jewry were it directed by a white gentile majority at any other group, should issue from an ethnic quarter notorious for its crass chauvinism and racial double standards?

Has anyone else bothered to inquire as to how or why a people whose presence in this country consists of little more than a miniscule two percent of the total population should somehow come to make up forty percent of the writers of a vulgar farce like Shameless, not to speak of the similarly conspicuous Jewish ethnic influence exerted on other decadent shows like Mad Men, House of Lies, Masters of Sex, Sex and the City, etc.? Why are so many people of Jewish descent so keen on exhibiting for public consumption a crude, dispiriting, dehumanizing portrait of American life, awash in rootlessness and the depravity of moral relativism, while through the mainstream Jewish organizations speaking nearly in unison out of the opposite sides of their mouths in addressing Jewish causes generally, and Zionism and the Arab-Israeli conflict in particular, with regard to which we are condescendingly instructed to uphold by these same influential representatives of God's chosen, the fairy tale of the morally superior Jewish state engaged in a heroic campaign against evil Arabs to retain its sacred ethno-cultural core, one, it is hypocritically insisted, that deserves to be upheld by force of the unstinting flow of American money, arms, and diplomatic cover, despite the overwhelming evidence that such a policy runs counter to genuine U.S. national interests, fomenting regional instability by locking the U.S. in a costly civilizational war with the Muslim world?

These are, after all, the same organized Jewish groups that comprise the vanguard of those who aggressively promote multiculturalism and open immigration in the United States and Europe. Could the gross hypocrisy at play in this juxtaposition therefore be any more palpable? or any more deplorable? Is there even anyone left with the courage necessary to broach such dangerous questions, in these shameless and disheartening days of low thought, and even lower living?",1392163200,5,4826,5.422103861517976

The idea of a story about a family's life may not seem special to you at first, but the plot for each of these characters (not just the main ones) is great and very well written. Plus this isn't just a normal family! :) All the characters in the show have great depth; very well characterisation and well expressed by their actors! Primarily a tv drama, this show is also hilarious and very ""raw"". Pretty truthful and straightforward with it's messages to the viewers, and definitely very engaging in it's plot. I had decided to give this a try once with just one episode, but it immediately turned into an all-3-seasons-chase. Caught up with all of them within several days, and no, I never did that before with any other TV show. Shameless is great! Personally, I believe each season keeps getting better so far, with season 3 being it's best at this point. Can't wait for season 4! Unfortunately very much underrated, I wish more people would recognise this show and give it a try!

  Beneath the wacky, dark humor there is always an authentic, poignant human problem.  For example, the young Debbie kidnapping the toddler from a neighborhood birthday party, a totally ridiculous concept, shows in the end how lonely she is.  Not only does she not have any friends to play with, or a nurturing grandparent like the role the pretend Aunt Ginger filled, but she doesn't even have any dolls with which to create imaginary interactions.  The latter is a key part of healthy child development.  The other irony is that the person who understands this in her is Fiona's boyfriend, not her own family, and he's the one who gives her a doll & stroller at the episode's conclusion.",1379808000,,774,4.862595419847328

2732553,5,B000MGBM1S,This is a knockoff of the British comedy of the same name. Some of these characters remind of the folks living in my neighborhood growing up. Just about everything done in Shameless is plausible. William Macy is perfect playing the estranged family alcoholic con man. I think he expends more energy on his scams than that required of an honest job. Can't wait for next season.,1373414400,,376,4.712121212121212

2732580,5,B000MGBM1S,"Seldom does a show consistently fail to disappoint.  Writing is unpredictable, with superbly cast characters who are not only believable, but deliver their dialogue with precision & pacing that has become all but a lost art.

There are not-so-subtle messages within messages, dealing with very real issues about family, integrity and loyalty, which holds a moral compass if not a mirror  to modern life.  At the same time it manages to navigate that fine line of making a statement while remaining non-judgemental.

I can not recommend this show highly enough.

2732626,4,B000MGBM1S,"Obviously I was off doing something else when television changed, because I could not get my jaw to snap shut after watching the first episde of ""Shameless.""  No, make that after watching the first ten minutes.

Holy Bad Behavior there Batman!

Yeah, yeah, I know cable was supposed to be pushing the envelope, but except for the F-word getting worked to death, it was pretty much business as usual. Or more to the point, BS as usual.  Dexter? Come on...same old cheap Moralizing for Dummies, only now we have a serial killer teaching Bad Guys about the wages of sin, not Jim Anderson teaching Bud and Kitten about good citizenship. I cancelled my cable and walked away for a couple years.  I took another peek a couple of weeks ago and fell right off of my high horse!

When did TV get so smart? So funny?  So...seditious?  When did they start using real writers, not frat boys or survivors of the Sheldon Schwartz School of Sitcoms? It all started with Treme, an amazing show about New Orleans that got it all right, the characters, the place, the setting, the music...everything.  Next came The Wire.  Another eye opener. Gritty, violent and good.  I sensed a new direction but still I had no clue how far things had gone. So then I watched The Vikings.  Let's hear it for Violence.  Eye-bugging, jaw dropping, violence with severed aortas pumping away, torsos cleaved in two, limbs flying, eyes gouged. And that's just  the opening credits.

I thought I had seen it all...until I watched the first episode of ""Shameless.""

Real, honest, funny, horrible...it's a family. The way families really are. More or less.  It feels real. Frank is not going to be Father of the Year, and Child Protective Services would have a field day if they peeked in the window. But he  loves his kids albeit in his own way. The kids look after one another. And love one another. That's not necessarily a given even when the parents are church-going, steadfast, homework monitoring, balanced meal serving pillars of the community. But the language is coarse, the kids are lighting up doobies, and no moral values are being ingrained.  They're just getting along day to day.

So is this a good thing, this new celebration of the sordid? This wallowing in sex, drugs, violence and all sorts of Bad Behavior?  What impact will it have on society?  What will happen to our children if they grow up seeing stuff on TV you would not discuss with your husband or wife (or both)? In the first episode of ""Shameless"", I saw a kid do something with his underwear (and for good reason) that had me torn between hysterical laughter and abject horror.  The show shocked my modesty, which is some good trick, believe you me.  But mostly I just like it.  Shameless is not pandering to our lower instincts, it's really funny. Witty, even. Bright, clever and disgusting. How's that for the trifecta?

Into the fourth episode now, and am torn between wanting to marry Frank or having him put down like a rabid dog. He is a drunk, a welfare cheat, an absentee father with the parenting skills of a newt.  And it is a joy to behold. William Macy is one of the best things ever to happen to movies or television. The entire cast is good. So far it keeps getting better.

And really, did the old school kind of television, the kind that taught Good Behavior have any influence on us? Did anyone ever not cheat on a spouse or on their income taxes because of Mike Brady's endless sermonizing? Do you ever see a criminal or some poor drugged out wretch or other miscreant and say to yourself ""There but for the grace of June and Ward Cleaver go I?""

Thought so.

Enjoy the bad stuff without guilt. It cannot possible make us any worse than we already are.  Four stars because this is a good show, not a great show.  Some episodes are a lot better than others. Compared to Treme, The Wire or Breaking Bad, it's not quite top tier. And there is not nearly enough William Macy.",1368316800,3,3932,4.56490727532097

2732688,5,B000MGBM1S,"When I first saw Shameless, I was almost disgusted. The stuff that goes on in the family - the dad inparticular - was just so.. terrible, unbelievable..but then.. I was hooked because of the realness and honest grit.

This is definitely a show unlike any other. Although some of it you just shake your head at in disbelief, most of it is relatable in one way or another and just so very real. I am totally hooked on it now. There are so many different story lines and types of drama within it, that it stays interesting and attention grabbing.

There are also many tear jerking moments, and not because of cheesey/corny moments, but because a lot of the situations are so seemingly real and/or sad or just emotional in general. (The second season gets more into the emotional aspect).

I actually bought this first season set for my mom as a Christmas present. She had never seen Shameless yet and it is such a great series on so many levels, that I thought she would like it.

It is one of those shows where you watch and say O M G, about 10 different times throughout the episode.

Definitely give it a try. Watch a few complete episodes before giving up on it! I gaurantee you will be hooked too! It truly is a series that EVERYONE can get something out of.",1362873600,,1260,4.390557939914163

I'm not sure what the problem might be.

I really do like the series though and it has made us laugh a lot.  It's very quirky and the characters are very strong characters.  I would love to watch an episode where it isn't stopping in the middle of a scene.",1361750400,2,582,4.245454545454545

Shameless had been recommended to me several times by several different people of all walks of life. They never gave much of an explanation other than it was something I would love and be thankful for having been recommended. They were dead on. Without giving away any plot points, the first season introduces you to a family that you have know all your life. The Gallaghers have lived on my block for years and now I get to watch them through a prism of refinement. The vicarious enjoyment that borders on voyuerism is apparent throughout. You have a true ""fly on the wall"" perspective of a no income family in one of the worst neighborhoods in Chicago. Yet you love them and feel the richness of their lives. I recommend it to anyone with an open mind and a curious spirit.

That being said, I do have Netflix which has opened many windows for me and allowed me to view shows that air on those ""fancy"" channels to which I do not subscribe.

One of these shows is Shameless.

Wow.  I was hooked from the first 30 seconds of the intro in the pilot episode where they're all standing outside by the huge bonfire and Frank is telling a snippet of information regarding his children, friends and neighbors.

Shameless is a one of a kind show - there is nothing else like it out there.  It's a raw, gritty and face paced `dramedy' based on a struggling Chicago family trying to make ends meet while the father, William H. Macy, is an out of control, narcissist alcoholic and the mother is missing in action.  The eldest sibling of the 6 children, played by Emmy Rossum, is the head of the household and does her best to keep things together, while the family goes buck wild in their day to day excursions.

This show is wonderfully cast and I think each and every one of those cast members does a phenomenal job portraying each of their characters.

I would highly reccommend Shameless to anyone looking for something different in their life.  Something with some pizazz, some spunk.  Just don't be surprised by the offensive and sometimes disturbing material you will see.",1349136000,,1511,4.478102189781022

I am so glad that I held off because I ventured to my local Pawn Shop today and what do you know, someone had sold a bunch of sealed, brand new tv seasons on Blu-Ray, they had Mad Men, Fringe, Star Wars The Clone Wars and Modern Family.

The family mores are scandalous, but the characters are fully human. I was put off by one of the main character's martyr complex, but it was a counter-point to the father's ""shameless"" pathological behavior. It amazes me that people can have children, then neglect them because of their own selfish needs.

Believe me it is worth the long wait if the show is as good as SHAMELESS. I had never heard of the British series but following a great local review of the US series I bought a copy . I was not disappointed. The entire cast are  brilliant. William H Macy  is  truly one of the World's finest actors. The series also moves  at the speed of the bullet train ,unlike most tv  stuff that  drags on to fill out it's time slot. Superb writing and very very funny. That is something  utra rare for US  as I  generally find that Americans cannot write comedy. I was not shocked by the so called child abuse. It wasn't meant to be taken seriously and  it was  the teenagers  that  make the first move. You could hardly call them children at their age and level of maturity. You can almost guarantee that the series will get more raunchy  in future if they can get away with what was in the first series. Most of the sex was in  viewers minds rather than seeing it  full-on on screen. Let's hope that the series does not lose its momentum  in the future as so many  do. Finally is is good to see an American home looking lived in unlike the vast majority of US shows/films where  they look like  they were only lived in by rich people. With millions of people living in poverty in the US , it is about time that more films reflected this.",1336608000,2,1475,4.112676056338028

Frank the protagonist is the guy you love to hate, and all his kids you love to love. The accents and some humor are quite British, but they have all the same problems and issues any American might have.

Now I'm sorry folks but watching an alcoholic Dad abuse his kids like that is NOT FUNNY, or endearing, or 'black comedy' its criminal. Have we really gotten so warped in our society that were now making 'dramatic comedies' that present abuse as entertainment? The sad thing to me is unlike the Amazon review I think this kind of Family and the Dad's behavior IS very common and the show is not far fetched nor what the kids endure unbelieveable. This show depicts the all too common life of living with an alcoholic but attempts to 'lighten it up' by presenting the alcoholic as 'eccentric' rather than abusive.

2732937,4,B000MGBM1S,"Showtime's 'Shameless' (2011) is a more self-conscious, fanciful, and decompressed adaption of the original BBC program of the same name. But, while 'Shameless' aggressively celebrates its inversion of traditional American values, it is important to keep in mind that it represents as much an idealization of the values it does uphold as 'Leave It To Beaver' (1957-1963) and 'Father Knows Best' (1954-1960) did in their era.

While 'Shameless,' which is essentially a comedic soap opera with dramatic overtones, explores 'the broken home,' adultery, alcoholism, teenage sexuality, homosexuality, mental illness, suicide, child sociopathy, sexual fetishism, theft as a way of life, and other elements traditionally consigned to life on 'the other side of the tracks' in America, note that very little genuine harm of any kind ever comes to any character, no matter how young or vulnerable, as a result of their behavior.

In traditional American television fashion, physical injuries heal within moments or by the next scene, emotional trauma seems to be only of the readily-manageable kind, and characters fall asleep drunk in the snow in the dead of the Chicago winter without freezing to death or losing toes or fingers.

Despite the abundance of threats and dangers surrounding and intruding upon them at every turn, including extreme violence and, in at least one case, a murder, nothing of permanent significance ever happens to any of the Gallaghers, who are clearly the heroes of the series, so what might be called 'the traditional unspoken American television show contract between the producers and the audience' applies: ""The Gallaghers will persevere.""

Even secondary characters seem impervious to trauma: teenage psychopath Mickey (Noel Fisher) is sent to juvenile prison, but reappears in the narrative when the producers need him to reappear; his months-long incarceration is brushed off as if completely inconsequential.

Another secondary character commits suicide with apparent success at the climax of Season One, but nothing nearly as final happens to any of the Gallaghers, with their almost a superhuman ability to recover from arrests, loss of employment, beatings, expulsions from school, kidnappings, and other experiences which most people find very difficult to assimilate and overcome in real life.

Despite the relative deprivation, chaos and squalor the Gallaghers are presented as existing in, note that their household is typically flooded in warm amber hues mornings and evenings. Though food is constantly implied to be in short supply, the motherless Gallaghers are constantly seen eating, and no one ever complains of anything approaching actual hunger.

While the Gallagher children's alcoholic and habitually grifting father, Frank (Willam H. Macy), is typically absent, the Gallagher children nonetheless receive genuine abundant love and oversight from oldest son Lip (Jeremy Allen White). Elder daughter Fiona (Emmy Rossum) and her best friend and neighbor, Veronica (Shanola Hampton), and their respective lovers, professional car thief Steve (Justin Chatwin) and bar owner Kev (Steve Howey) are regularly on hand to hold the figurative roof up and thus prevent outright catastrophe.

Which is to say that the American branch of the Gallagher clan, despite the show's trappings, actually have it pretty good.

As in 'Father Knows Best,' 'The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriett' (1952-1966), or 'The Brady Bunch' (1969-1974), most episodes of 'Shameless' end in 'feel good moments' in which some or all members of the Gallagher family reassert their love and concern for one another, though here in a hearty 'us against them' fashion that wouldn't have been out of place on 'Married With Children' (1987-1997).

As the degree of sentimentalization remains identical, regardless of the values esteemed, 'Shameless' no more presents an accurate or honest view of American life, or a segment of American life, than 'The Donna Reed Show' (1958-1966) did in its time. This is important, as some critics, and no doubt many viewers, seem to believe that 'Shameless' is finally representing a segment of American life as it actually is in fact.

The irreverent 'Shameless' is a creative, colorful, and romanticized version of its BBC counterpart. It is funny when it tries to be and dramatic when it wants to be. William H. Macy, Emmy Rossum, Jeremy Allen White, and Joan Cusack, among others, are beautifully wedded, even welded, to their parts.

If 'Shameless' is grossly unrealistic and potentially irresponsible from a social perspective, then perhaps the producer's frequently rose-tinted approach to their predominantly White suburban ghetto is meant to underscore the program's fictional basis, even if we ""all know a family exactly like that.""",1329696000,2,4781,5.454668470906631
2732948,4,B000MGBM1S,I'm glad I found this show early enough in its running to get caught up on the previous episodes. But now I have to wait each week to see what happens.

2732949,5,B000MGBM1S,"I love this series.  I've been a William H. Macy fan for years and though he's played a lot of character roles and been excellent in them he's seldom the lead.  I'm so happy he was chosen to play the patriarch in ""Shameless"".  Having said that I was a little disappointed in the first episode.  In the pilot he was mostly face down sprawled on the ground or floor sleeping off the alcohol and pills he'd taken.  Macy, Frank Gallagher, is a single father of six kids.  The eldest is Fiona at 21.  Since their mother left almost two years ago Fiona has had her hands full raising the younger kids with not only no help from Frank but major interference on his part.  Frank waltzes in and out of the house to party, take the kid's money, rage, and be a general nuisance.  Fiona is played by Emmy Rossum.  She's a real standout in the pilot but her charm waned for me in subsequent episodes.  She has beautiful brown eyes but how many close ups do we really need?  Another stand out cast member is oldest brother and brainiac Jeremy Allen White as Phillip or Lip as his family calls him.  At 17 he's trying to find his place in the world though he's already sure of himself as the heart of his family.  I have to mention 10 year old Emma Kenney who plays Debbie.  She's a real stand out mimicking Fiona's mother role by taking care of her toddler brother Liam.  She's always the first to come to anyone's rescue when upset threatens and no matter how badly Frank or anyone in their tough Chicago Southside neighborhood treats her she still leads with her heart.  This is not to say she's a pushover.  This little girl knows how to come out swinging metaphorically.

""Shameless"" is real, meaning the language and situations can be graphic, the emotions raw, and morality is pliable but it's all for a reason.  I can't wait for the second season.  I think it starts tonight!",1329004800,2,1868,4.4035087719298245

And just like the U.K.'s, America's 'Shameless' is so well-acted and brilliantly written I watched almost every episode in a row on a rainy Sunday. We're invited to view the hilarious and erratic lives & exploits of the Gallagher family in Chicago's South Side. Frank (Macy) is a chauvinistic alcoholic on disability and has six kids: Fiona (a sexy Rossum) is bearing the responsibility of supporting the clan; Philip (Jeremy Allen White) is a high school genius who sells his services; Ian (Cameron Monaghan) an active homosexual who wants to join the Army; and then there's younger Carl, Debbie, and Liam (who is black!). The remaining outside characters are fantastic and the show is laced with off-the-wall one-liners and scenarios that are socially conscious of the underlying difficult economic situation that they're faced with. But make no mistake about it - it is Macy's drunken white-trash antics and utter contempt for society, that clearly owns the show. Currently on the second season every Sunday and it just seems to get better and better as it goes along.

The pilot of this series is quitte good, with an excellent cast, headlined by the beautiful and talented Emmy Rossum (""Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom Of The Opera""). There's only one griope I have with the pilot: a scene showing a naked guy in bed. Did he HAVE TO BE FULLY NUDE? That scene was disgusting, and makes me seriously consider whether or not I want to watch more episodes of this otherwise interesting series. I hope the gay character is straightened out at some point as well. At least, nothing was shown in the pilot, but you never know how far writers will take things these days.

The rest of the episodes are really good, but my main issue remains: Ian is still gay, and though nothing is shown, it's still strongly implied. And do they have to profane God's name? (ie. God's name followed by a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity). Real minuses for me, hence the four star rating. Other than that, I highly enjoy the series. I like how Fiona really loves her siblings, even the rebellious ones, like Carl (the actor looks like he could really be Miley Cyrus' younger brother).

2732973,5,B000MGBM1S,"So just how hot is Emmy Rossum!  But I digress.  Where Californication is carried by David Duchovny and Evan Handler, the humor on Shameless comes from an ensemble cast.

All of the characters are ""flawed"" to a certain degree and most have redeeming qualities as well.  What makes this work is that the plot lines are not formulaic or ""black & white"".  Furthermore, what makes this show truly rare, is that there is evolution wrapped around the comedy, where character development is highly evident.  Many shows that are billed as comedies get lost when the writers attempt to show growth in the characters.  Generally, a show will last for a season or 2 or until the formula that made the show funny is lost.  I don't see that happening here, as there are so many directions that the writers can take show while staying true to the comedy.

Of course there is a fair amount of nudity and dialogue that would even Alec Baldwin blush!

Finally, while the US TV viewer would not likely imagine the number of shows that have emanated from the UK, the vast majority implode when ""re-made"" for American consumption.  The aforementioned has most certainly not happened here.  Watch a few episodes of the UK series Shameless.

So if you've seen the UK version then you know what's going to happen next in the US version(aside from the last episode). But the US version does have A LOT more female nudity which never hurts.

And I don't know about where they are but I worked all over Kansas City, Mo in nothing but the poorer ghetto type areas and I've never seen a predominantly white ghetto, actually I've never heard of one anywhere in the US. I'm not saying that we don't have them but it seems more believable that there might be an area in the UK with a large number of poorer white people.

Frank has few, if any, redeeming characteristics, and the kids are reared by the oldest sibling, Fiona.  Fiona's boyfriend is Steve, a successful car thief with a heart of gold.  Steve is played by James McAvoy, a Scotsman I've heard described as ""the thinking woman's dream man.""

I worked in England in 2008-9 and was able to catch-up on Channel 4 UK, so I got to see several years of this series. Don't try this at home - unless you have a UK ISP, you are blocked! Channel 4 online is only for internal consumption.
I want to buy them all! I don't usually buy TV series, but this is worth it. I contacted the production company to see if they had plans to issue the US region (for those who don't know, DVDs have regional coding - US players can't play UK regional disks.) The production company referred me to Channel 4 UK, the distributors. The Channel 4 website is for UK residents - without a UK postcode, you can't even fill out their comment form.
Only being able to buy the first season is like getting a taste, then finding out you can't have the feast. Unless you've been able to keep up with the spotty showings on the Sundance Channel, you ain't seeing no more (except for bits and pieces on You Tube.) Since there is a continuing story arc, it's tough to just jump in in the middle of a season.
What I want to know is, how dumb are these distributors? I know you can buy the whole series in the UK. How much of a risk is it to print up a batch on US regional disks? DVDs are almost pure profit! There's got to be tens of thousands of Shameless fans in the US. They can only make money. Why don't they? That's what I want to know.",1282089600,2,1429,4.053003533568905

Humor, sex, drama, pathos, and what's a pleasant surprise is that Frank Gallagher ISN'T the main character, which I'd expected, but is just one of a great ensemble cast. Frank is kind of like the character Mickey Rourke played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barfly/dp/B0000696I5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barfly</a>, but his little comments about life being a ""working-class hero"" and how tough it is being a ""single parent"" are hilarious, since A)he's probably been on the dole his entire life & never worked a day and B)He's so screwed up all the time that his oldest daughter, Fiona(played by the wonderful Anne-Marie Duff), has single-handedly raised her sibs since their Mum left a couple of years before the series opens. With the help of assorted neighbors and friends, the Gallagher clan struggle on.
With nearly as many plotlines per episode as a ""Seinfeld"" episode, it's no surprise that American TV is ripping ""Shameless"" off(ala ""The Office""), reportedly to star William H. Macy as a Rust-Belt version of Frank. I enjoy Macy, but there's only one Frank Gallagher(except when I'm bloody pissed, and then I see two or three.

This show doesn't pull any punches in its depiction and feels truly honest whilst producing belly laughs and snickers alike throughout most episodes.
General plot: mum does a runner on a family with six kids and dad goes on a three year bender, leaving eldest daughter to run the family with only meager resources while also trying to have a life. The youngest daughter's coping is less than perfect and provides some of the funniest and scariest moments of the first series.

play it close to the vest in this film, because of his part--that of a young man drawn into the vortex of an

insane, volatile dictator, and McAvoy doesn't miss a  beat.  He was marvelous.

So I bought ""Shameless,"" and it is wonderful in every department:  the writing, the directing, and primarily

the acting were all spectacular.  I laughed, and then, once, I was brought to the point of damp eyes.  Man, this

DVD is worth the money.  I can't wait for the other three seasons.  (Also, I've read that McAvoy is cast in the

The Gallaghers - and neighbors Veronica and Kev - are a unique bunch.

Shameless maintains it's quality throughout the first 5 series, and a 6th series is due for 2009.",1178496000,3,434,4.837837837837838
2733047,5,B000MGBM1S,"I ordered this DVD without having seen or heard anything about the series, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was thoughtful, funny, and generous, even while maintaining a gritty realism. Whenever an episode or storyline started to drift into the ridiculous or melodramatic it was quickly intercepted by a brutal but honest (and hopeful) reality. And even when their characters were at their most unlikable, the actors brought to them a warmth and passion that kept you involved. (In my opinion episode six is one of TVs best examples of the diversity of emotion that can be explored in under an hour.)

Basic plot: Single father Frank Gallagher [David Threlfall], whose wife disappeared about three years ago, lives (sometimes) on a council estate in Manchester (England) with his six children (Fiona, Lip, Ian, Carl, Debbie, and Liam), aged 20-3, respectively. Other central characters include the children's neighbors, a young couple named Kevin and Veronica, and Fiona's well-to-do boyfriend Steve [James McAvoy]. Together they deal with relationships, poverty, abandonment, their father's alcoholism, debt collectors, and the local police. It's not an easy life, but the family is determined to enjoy it whenever and however they can. There *is* some violence (fist fights), nudity, drinking, lots of swearing, and even one extremely inappropriate, even illegal, sexual relationship, but it is addressed and responded to reasonably (though definitely not in the PBS-broadcast sort of way). The younger children/characters really seem to peak in the second half of the season, as they become more integral to the plot. Their additional screen time is well-deserved, as they are all exceptionally talented actors.

As for the DVD itself, it is, of course, Season 1. Although Season 4 recently finished airing, this is the first installment to be released on DVD in the US. Disc 1 consists of episodes 1-4 (45 min. each) and Disc 2 contains episodes 5-7 and two bonus features: a brief ""Meet the Cast"" and an interview with Paul Abbott. Suffice to say this is a bare-bones DVD release for this day and age, but the show's quality warrants the purchase. Also note, subtitles are on by default for anyone who has trouble with the accent.",1177545600,55,2247,5.153424657534247
2733048,5,B000MGBM1S,"Brilliant, ""comedy-drama"".  Because of the differences between British humor and American humor an American audiences will find more drama than comedy.  Yes, we do ""get"" irony; however, it tends to make us smile rather than laugh out loud.

This series contains some of the best, most powerful scripts I've ever seen written for broadcast television. Yet, I expect this very R-rated series to be heavily criticized for coarse language, for themes of sex, scenes of drunkenness, and under-age smoking.  Nevertheless, this series is one of the most family-positive series you'll ever see.

Imagine the picture perfect family, the very embodiment of ""family values"".  Then one day somebody in the family snaps and is revealed to be involved in criminal activity, or infidelity, or substance abuse or darker more sinister assaults on the body and mind of other family members.  In short, this imaginary picture-perfect family is dysfunctional.

Now, envision the opposite, a family with all the trappings of being dysfunctional.  The father is unemployed and alcoholic, the children thieve, smoke and swear.  One child has to keep his head shaved because he's so prone to nits, and there is no mother in the home because she's taken the family van and run away. Yet, this family is supportive, loving, caring and more honest than the Brady Bunch ever was.

There are no skeletons in the Gallagher family closet.  They are very much a what-you-see-is-what-you-get group. Sometimes funny sometimes surreal and unlikely the goings on in this family are often moving and always entraining. While not promoting ""family values"" this is a very family positive series (but not for the whole family: R-rated I said).  There is good reason why this show is called ""Shameless"".

One warning for American audiences.  The story is set in Manchester, so that people in the story have strong northern accents.  If your ear is unused to this or if your exposure to British accents ends at Hugh Grant... there are subtitles available on the DVD.
