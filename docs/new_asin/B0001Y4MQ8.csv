8018242,3,B0001Y4MQ8,"This DVD is available as part of the Ultimate Dragon Collection (Grindhouse Experience.) That is a 10 film set that packages this DVD (same cover and all) in a cardboard box with 2 other DVDs.

Currently that set is selling for $19.98 on Amazon. So for $2 you get two extra discs of Bruce Lee knock offs.",1197504000,3,304,4.333333333333333
8018243,2,B0001Y4MQ8,"First things first: this quadruple feature does not, I repeat NOT star Bruce Lee. The films included star a host of amusingly sub-par Lee imitators that sprung up after his death (Bruce Li, Bruce Le, Bruce Leung, Dragon Lee).
""The Dragon Lives Again"" is an unforgettable movie that was the reason I ordered this disc. The premise: Bruce Lee (Leung) is in hell, where he becomes the enemy of a group of famous characters (James Bond, Zatoichi, Dracula, The Exorcist, The Godfather, Emmanuelle) that want to overthrow the emperor of the underworld. Along the way, he befriends the One Armed Swordsman and...Popeye the sailor! A veritable cornucopia of copyright infringements, this is just about the most enjoyably bad Bruceploitation movie you'll ever see.
""Bruce Lee: The Star of All Stars"" (""Exit the Dragon, Enter the Tiger"") tells the story of one of Bruce Lee's pupils (Li) who wants to unveil the truth about Lee's death. His quest sees him meeting Bruce's mistress, getting tangled with the mob, and even engaging in some Bruce Lee-inspired comedy relief moments.
""Enter the Game of Death"" is the best movie on the set. A shameless ripoff of Bruce Lee's uncompleted ""Game of Death,"" it's packed to the gills with surreal and exciting fight scenes. Though Bruce Le is no Lee in charisma, his fighting skills are decent and the action scenes are among the best in a bruceploitation movie. Also starring Bolo Yeung.
I didn't watch Dragon Lee's ""Mission for the Dragon."" Sue me.
These two double-sided DVDs from VideoAsia are absolutely horrible. ""Enter the Game of Death"" is widescreen, but it has a jittery picture that makes it nearly unwatchable. ""Dragon Lives Again"" is in severely cropped and faded full screen that makes the already lacklustre fight scenes that much worse. ""Bruce Lee: Star of Stars"" is actually in its original Chinese language track...but the subtitles are faded and constantly run off the screen, making the action sometimes impossible to follow! Argh!
The only special feature is something called ""InstaAction,"" which allows you to watch the movies' action scenes skipping past all that pesky plot.",1103587200,10,2128,5.048295454545454
8018244,2,B0001Y4MQ8,"What can I say...? The only plus signs about this particular 2-pack are the fact that it features one of my childhood fav's, Enter the Game of Death(which, in my opinion, outshined many of the other attempts to present Bruce Lee's true vision for Game of Death) and the Bruce Li film is HOTTT because for the most part he's being HIMSELF and the subtitles and original language give it a certain authenticity that an english dubbed version wouldn't have. What left me P.O.'d was the quality(ie, Enter the Game of Death looked like it filmed during an earthquake and the plot structure wasn't there until Bruce Le got to the Tower of Death...before that, Bruce fights Bolo Yeung in the forest, then they're in the ring and Bruce breaks the guy's neck, then they ""fight to the death"" by the tower? Gimme a break.) The other films were BRUCE ploitation at worst and not worth mentioning. My advice...save your money and get a hold of Chinese Connection 2, the Fist of Fury Legacy, Exit the Dragon...Enter the Tiger, & Game of Death II.",1095897600,,1032,4.614130434782608
8018245,1,B0001Y4MQ8,"Take a look, it is a Chinese fake.  That is NOT Bruce Lee.  It is Bruce Le.  A pathetic scamming of a great Chinese-American!",1090108800,,125,4.125
