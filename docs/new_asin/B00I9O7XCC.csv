8640225,5,B00I9O7XCC,"I am not a musician. I am a writer. However, I bought this DVD in order to see how a great composer / artiste / creative man lives his life. I am pleased to say that watching this DVD has brought me so much joy. I have had the chance to get a glimpse into the life of a creative master. I wish this DVD ran for much longer than it does. And I have a lot of questions. I also wish that the DVD covered much more of Penderecki's travels outside Europe, that is, in America or Asia or Africa and other places. I wish they explained certain things like how he makes his money [his sources of income] or how he arranged funding for a certain important building on his property which was featured in the film. Nevertheless, I am so glad to have this DVD because I know that Professor Penderecki will not be around much for longer. This DVD is an everlasting record of a year in the life of a great man. I am glad to see some of his creative habits and life achievements on screen. I will watch this DVD several times throughout my life. God bless the producers of this DVD and may God be with Maestro Penderecki.",1531958400,,1106,4.125
8640226,5,B00I9O7XCC,"What an interesting personality!  Krzysztof Penderecki has had a profound influence on musicians and on his audiences since 1960 (when he composed Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima). As a young composer, Penderecki infamously submitted three separate compositions in a national contest under three aliases and three different types of handwriting and won the top three prizes.  His fame has caused him to be sought out by personalities no less than Stanley Kubrick (for whom he lent music for the film The Shining) and composer/Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.  But in this documentary, beautifully directed by Anna Schmidt, Penderecki is revealed to be humble, approachable, and sincere.

Fans of Pendereckis music who only know about him through his recordings will discover many things that may help them understand his process of composition.  For example, he uses colored pencils when he writes notation.  Penderecki doesnt like to be alone; he likes to surround himself with people he cares about.  And he has a penchant for trees.  Penderecki helped design the layout of the trees and gardens on his expansive estate, and he goes out regularly to purchase more trees, many of which he plants himself.

While there are no complete performances of his works, snippets of Polymorphia, Threnody, and Symphony No. 3 (among others) can be heard throughout the film.  The 1080i Hi-Def picture on Blu-ray is sharp and clear; the audio is 2.0 PCM stereo, which will suffice for a documentary feature.  Bonuses are limited to short interviews with Jonny Greenwood (in German) and Lorin Maazel (in German with subtitles, surprisingly), as well as a selection of trailers from the C major label.  I would love to see more composer documentaries presented like this.  Highly recommended.",1397001600,,1788,5.231578947368421
8640227,3,B00I9O7XCC,"I have followed Penderecki ever since his Threnody burst upon a startled world and have many of his works on DVD and CD. I was hoping for more from this first Penderecki Blu-ray release and was more than a little disappointed. Not a single one of his works, many of which are quite short, is offered, all we get are snips, many of which were very old, mixed up in an overly philosophical risotto of Polish, German (subtitled in English) and home counties English (inexcusably not subtitled) by pop musician Jonny Greenwood who mutters into his hand and is very hard to hear. Penderecki rabbits on about his labyrinth on his vast Polish estate but none of this is a worthwhile substitute for a decent feed of his music. This is a disc for specialists and I predict those who like me want to hear his music will feel short-changed. This program would have been a very good extra to a recording of say The Devils of Loudon but on its own is a basic Mac substituting for a prime steak at top dollar price. Interesting but very poor value.",1395964800,3,1034,4.447368421052632
