Thus, it is a much better deal, it also comes with never seen before interview with Audrey while filming these series, and other extras!!!!  If you don't  have a DVD player yet, you are missing treasures like these series.
The  DVD version comes with more than 4 hrs of video and separate musical  tracks.
Ideal after a hectic daily routine, just to lay back and watch  it or listen to it with headphones repeatedly. The excellent commentaries  are subtly interspersed with soothing world music that flows like poetry  into your ears!!!!",940377600,6,606,4.759615384615385
