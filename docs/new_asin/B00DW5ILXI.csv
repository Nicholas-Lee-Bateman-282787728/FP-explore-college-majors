5861038,5,B00DW5ILXI,Very engaging narrator.  Have also previously seen his series on the Impressionists. Brings out a lot of interesting background facts as well as putting developments into a broader perspective.,1406246400,,193,5.655172413793103
5861039,5,B00DW5ILXI,This is a fascinating look at the cultures of what used to be called the Dark Ages. Clearly that was a misnomer.,1400284800,,112,4.136363636363637
5861040,5,B00DW5ILXI,I am a huge fan of Waldemar Januszczak's videos.  His extensive knowledge and  no-nonsense witty delivery makes history and art very accessible for the everyday non-scholar who is interested such topics.  He packs his programs with a lot of interesting history and facts while keeping it very watchable and utterly interesting and entertaining.  The Dark Ages: An Age of Light got me very interested in a period of history I knew little about.  After watching this program I was interested to find out more and have been doing a lot more reading on the topics and period of history that Mr. Januszszak covers in this program.  For me this is worth every penny.,1397520000,5,660,4.79646017699115

5861042,2,B00DW5ILXI,"Januszczak overstates his case on the shaky premise that the Germanic tribes weren't barbaric because they had fine craftsmen and liked bling. Compared to what art, architecture, scholarship they destroyed, what they created in carving and jewelry certainly doesn't justify the subtitle, The Age of Light. Islam can certainly justify that  as could Byzantium, which is excluded. This is more opinion than scholarship and it doesn't add up. More disappointing because the author's previous works that are much more solid.",1382227200,19,520,5.5
5861043,5,B00DW5ILXI,"Dark Ages consists of 4th to 11th century. This BBC documentary is an educational look at an era that brought about wonders of art, architecture, artifacts, and aesthetics. But history has previously given it such dark connotations. This is an excellent film of visuals of the artistic treasures from all over the world of the Dark Age era. The Dark Ages were not as dark as the name suggests. Did the Barbarians get a bum rap? Narrator Waldemar Januszczak says ""Yes."" This British art historian is informative while entertaining. I first enjoyed his humorous presentation style in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Every-Picture-Tells-a-Story/dp/B001O7R768/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Every Picture Tells a Story</a>&nbsp;. That is also recommended highly for art enthusiasts.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 hour-long episodes.
1 THE CLASH OF THE GODS--Persecuted Christians looked for new ways to visualize their God. Symbols evolved, placed on the tombs and artifacts surviving to today's modern times. They decorated elaborate worship spaces as well.

2 WHAT THE BARBARIANS DID FOR US--Barbarians caused Rome to fall. They took to Christianity and thus produced some of the greatest earthly architecture and artistic achievements of the Dark Ages. Huns--Vandals--Goths of the 4th century; misunderstood groups.

3 THE WONDER OF ISLAM--The Arabians birthed the Islam faith and it spread to the Christian regions. Islam art forms traveled with the movement and left a footprint behind. Its architecture was a wonder; a graphic eye-delight.

4 THE MEN OF THE NORTH--Viking raids on Ireland and Britain was a method to steal the monk's art treasures. However, the raiders were as accomplished in creating their own jewelry, calligraphy, Gospels, and bling.

A worthy addition for any artistic library: home, public, university, or gallery.",1378944000,14,1873,5.771739130434782
5861044,5,B00DW5ILXI,"This is a marvelous series. Ever since learning many years ago that the ""Dark Ages"" characterization was unjustified, though not nearly as unjustified as the sticky persistence of it, I've enjoyed works which show why it's a travesty. Januszczak is an irrepressible and highly informed host taking us through many breathtaking examples of the creativity of this maligned era. The architecture, works of art great and small, and the elegance and taste apparent in them make this a real treat. Any age should be so dark!",1486166400,2,518,5.034883720930233

5861046,5,B00DW5ILXI,"Very interesting and informative series. The host is very engaging and brings the subject down to earth. His premise that the Dark Ages were anything but, is intriguing. Using art as his emphasis to this, clearly shows us how the term ""Dark Ages"" is misleading.

5861047,5,B00DW5ILXI,"We have watched the first two episodes of this series on the Dark Ages and been very impressed.  Almost every detail presented has been something we had known before.  Although the places such as the Catacombs of Priscilla may have been known to us (I have been there), the details about the art and architecture were revelatory. The presenter is fun to listen to and he gets you excited about the subject.  Understanding a people through its art is what most museums do but this program adds a new dimension by placing the art where it is found.  Fantastic show.",1483574400,2,563,4.6

""sleigh - a vehicle like an open-air carriage, pulled by horses, using runners instead of wheels for use in winter on show/ice. sled - a small single person conveyance to slide down hills, usually has runners, but may just have a flat bottom. sledge - any kind of flat conveyance to be dragged over ground.""

I continued to watch to see if the color would change to normal but after 10 minutes I could not continue because it was too distracting.

5861101,5,B00DW5ILXI,"This is a great series. Januszczak is ribald and irreverent, but amidst all of the full-throated jocularity are some amazing insights into how the ""Dark Ages"" help to advance the arts, religion and science in the so-called Dark Ages.

5861103,4,B00DW5ILXI,This has 4 episodes and we really love them.  The trouble is that the 4th episode was so visually distorted that we couldn't really enjoy watching it.  I'm sure it would have been as good as the others if you don't mind just listening.  We learned a lot from this series.  Too bad there was a problem with the last one.

The video quality of the digitized version is obviously corrupt (looks like an old TV with a bad antenna).  I have reported it to Amazon (1/24/16), but they haven't fixed it yet.  Once they do, I will revise my review.

I was more interested in watching a documentary about the dark ages not knowing this was only about the art (I didn't notice the fine print on the cover) but I still enjoyed watching it.  I'm not an artsy-fartsy person so I probably will not get much replay value out of this documentary.,1438300800,2,343,4.428571428571429

5861122,5,B00DW5ILXI,My only complaint is that Januszczak forgets that there is more to civilization than just great art.  I don't care how sophisticated the Huns or the Vikings were in terms of their art.  The centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire in the West were very dark in terms of the way people lived and what they knew.,1406678400,3,318,4.372881355932203

8598596,2,B00DW5ILXI,"the visuals, the camera work, the cheeky delivery, even the music, are all fun.  On the other hand, for example, the images often don't match what he's talking about and his facts are, ah, loose.  He's tackling a very interesting and complex idea (how Christianity retained, changed, deleted, or reinterpreted 'pagan' culture).  But he dumbs it down to the point that it is no longer close to accurate and even deceptive: I presume he knows better.  All he needed to do was temper his pagan-christian associations with just a modicum of nuance and this could have been useful, even in an academic class.  As it is, the only way it could be used would be to demonstrate its many, and sometimes deep, errors.  Specific examples?  Well, Santa Sabina was not built by Constantine, but rather 100 years later, to name one.  Others? The transformation of the image of Jesus from beardless to bearded...sure, I sort of like the Apollo to Jupiter thing, but it is also (moreso?) from Roman senator to Greek philosopher.  Mary based on Isis, fine, but there are plenty of 'mother suckling babes' goddesses that could just as easily apply and, for the record, Mary was never worshipped as a feminine goddess in Christianity.  The basilica form transformed to the rotunda?  nonsense, frankly--these were going on at the same time and Monreal in Sicily sort of disproves his thesis even as he is explicating it: it is not a combo. of basilica and mausoleum at all and please note that the 'Jupiter' Christ seems to be smiling rather pleasantly , not the uber-masculine image we're meant to see.  The simple point is that Christianity transformed that which it borrowed so that the message behind the image or building is utterly re-interpreted in shockingly novel ways (the  imperial mausoleum form becomes the christian baptistry--not the 'church' so much--so it no longer is the house of death, but the house of spiritual death and spiritual re-birth.  Isn't that a lot more interesting?).  Besides, of course each age creates images and architecture that appeal to their own artistic and, dare I say, spiritual sensitivities.  That is cool.  Why not just go with that?  Oh, and nothing in this first installment took place within what was ever called the ""Dark Ages.""",1512172800,,2258,4.897368421052631
