1255941,4,B00002QUMI,"That's what I want to know!  The sound guy was funny as hell.  Is he really like that?  Has he been in any other movies?  The Blair Witch Rejects is weird and funny and I heard somewhere that there wasn't a  script.  If that's true, these actors have alot of talent!  If it was  scripted, the actors have to be really really good to pull off those lines.  Either way I laughed alot.  Monique Pierre as one of the assistants was  hilarious.  SHe reminds me of me (really sarcastic and charming).  Her  suitcase part was really great.  The surprise ending make me snort milk out  of my nose, so that wasn't very fun, but once I cleaned myself and the t.v.  off, I was still laughing.  Great movie!",962928000,2,695,4.296875
1255942,1,B00002QUMI,"Don't let the ""Blair Witch"" comparison entice you into buying this film.  Focus your attention on the ""Rejects"" part of the title.  I know this is a spoof, but it's not even funny.  Watching this  film is like being trapped in a room with the 10 most annoying people you  know for 90 minutes.  The characters are sub-stereotypical, patently fake  and unbelievable.  The most frustrating part of the film is the fact that  there never seem to be less than four people talking at the same time  throughout the whole thing.  One girl can't stop smiling even when she is  supposed to act afraid.  As for the hilarious surprise ending--if anyone  finds it, please let me know because the only thing hilarious and  surprising about this movie was the fact that I actually paid for it and  wasted 90 minutes of my life watching it.",962496000,,824,4.5793103448275865
1255943,4,B00002QUMI,"My wife bought this tape for me knowing I love spoofs.  I laughed so hard, I almost died!  Director Jerry Vasilatos brought together a great ensemble cast, notably Brent Beebe as the Sound Guy.  This guy is over-the-top and  believable.  It's hard to believe his performance wasn't scripted at all.  Deborah Wolff, the Producer, was full of life and irritatingly hilarious!  Mostly, the timing between Ms. Wolff and Kevin Leadingham, the Director (in  the film) was wonderful and very entertaining.  Watching this group of  people bumble their way through slap-stick adventure was funny enough for  me to rewind the tape and run it again that same night during a  get-together with my friends!",961200000,,693,5.035398230088496
7916126,1,B00002QUMI,"I bought this movie at a garage sale, it was in a box of VHS tapes marked $1.00 each! I loved the Blair Witch Project so I thought it would be fun to watch a take off on it. When I tried to give the lady a dallor for the movie she told me the movie was so bad that she would feel guilty charging me a dollar, so I got it for .25 cents it wasn't much of a bargan!",1095552000,,362,3.4814814814814814
7916127,1,B00002QUMI,"Wow, what a low budget piece of garbage this was! I'm guessing that the people giving this movie anything over one star must be friends and family of the loser that produced it.  The only entertainment that my girlfriend and I got out of it was watching it burn and melt after throwing it in the fireplace!",1072310400,,306,4.368421052631579
7916128,1,B00002QUMI,THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT AS DUMB AS BARFEY SPEARS THE ACTORS ARE JUST LIKE HER THE ARE REJECTS WITH NO TALENT,1022716800,,104,4.0
7916129,4,B00002QUMI,"I recently viewed The Blair Witch Rejects on home video.  I have not been exposed to many Blair Witch spoofs, only a couple of short amateur videos.  I believe Blair Witch Rejects may be the only feature length spoof of the original.
Anyway, putting it in a Hollywood setting was a great idea, and I really got a kick out of the scene when our fearless filmmakers finally ventured to the woods, and ran into several other clusters of filmmakers making the same documentary.  That says a lot about people jumping on a bandwagon, taking advantage and cashing in on a fad that will quickly fade.  Isn't that Hollywood?
Special kudos to Brent Beebe, the actor playing the sound man.  I really got a kick out of his subtle ""dumb guy"" performance, quite a few laughs there.
For a moment I was fooled by the ""Artisan Lawyer"" in front of Mann's Chinese Theater.  I really thought our filmmakers were busted, because you never know who is on the streets of Hollywood.  That was an actress, wasn't it?",1014940800,,991,4.564971751412429
7916130,1,B00002QUMI,THE ONLY THING IN COMMON THIS HAS WITH THE BLAIR WITCH IS THE TITLE. INCREDIBLY BORING AND STUPID MOVIE. SAVE YOUR MONEY!,1001980800,,121,4.545454545454546
7916131,1,B00002QUMI,"This movie was not funny. It was stupd nothing in this movie
 made me laugh. The only thing the movie made me do was tape over
 it. I wasted money on this movie and to tell you the truth the
 blair whitch project was funny compared to the blair whitch
 rejects. Don't waste time or money on this movie.",999216000,,302,4.067796610169491
7916132,4,B00002QUMI,"My friends got this moview and brought it over one night and we had a blast! This movie is just as fun as it can get - face it, if you are into spoofs, you aren't looking for The English Patient or something (and who  could really live through that..maybe ""darkgenius"" who also wrote  a review for this film - maybe he's a little TOO dark and deep for spoof  comedy? ) So, invite some friends over and have some libations and a  few laughs - maybe watch the original and then this spoof of Rejects that  poke kooky fun at Hollywood and how the Blair Witch phenomenon has swept  filmmaking of today! If you've been to Hollywood - there are people out  there that really are like this, believe it or not! So, if you are  interested in this ""Living In Oblivion"" style of filmmaking check  it out!",963100800,,793,4.268456375838926
7916133,5,B00002QUMI,"I just read the horrible review this movie just got and I couldn't disagree more!  ""Blair Witch Rejects"" is just what it's supposed to be: ridiculous, funny, mind-boggling and annoying.  The way these 10  people interact is about as real as you can get.  Show me one situation  with 10 real people where only one of them talks at a time, and I'll show  you a well-scripted bunch of actors.  This movie is not about scripting or  peace and tranquility.  This movie is about a group of bumbling morons who  pinball off each other as they all try to obtain their individual  objectives.  Let me tell you something:  It takes alot of talent to act  this insane!  BRAVO to all the actors and to Jerry Vasilatos, the director!  Worth every penny (if you're informed as to what you're buying, that  is!)!",963100800,,797,4.539007092198582
7916134,4,B00002QUMI,"I think Dark Genius needs to get out of his college library basement and loosen up lol... ""Rejects"" starts a little slow... but the characters have more personality than the ones in other ""Blair  Witch"" spoofs and are pretty creative considering what I read here  that they all improvised. Once they get to the forest and run into the  other film crews it's pretty hilarious. I agree with the other reviewer  that Brent the Sound Guy and Deborah the Producer were the standouts. This  is definitely one not to take seriously... I recommend you pop it in on a  Friday night with lots of friends, beer, pizza, and enjoy. I found they  have a website through IMDB at blairwitch-rejects.com that spoofs the  official ""Blair Witch"" site as well. Nice touch. Only other spoof  I've seen that is as good on a different level is ""The Oz Witch  Project"", I recommend it as well (I think their site is at  ozwitch.com).",962928000,,909,4.61875
