McGann take the helm of each oater.

The first of three Richard Dix westerns - ""AMERICAN EMPIRE"" (Released: 11 December 1942) (82 mins/B&W), Dan Taylor (Richard Dix) and Paxton Bryce (Preston S. Foster) are two longtime friends out to make a fortune in post Civil War Texas --- Dan's sister and Paxton's wife Abby (Frances Gifford) assist them in their search, when they set up a thriving cattle business --- Paxton seeks to gain power over them all, and alienates himself from Dan and Abby. Only through personal tragedy does Paxton re-gain his senses.

In the final feature - ""BUCKSKIN FRONTIER"" (Released: 14 May 1943) (65 mins/B&W), an action packed western adventure has good guy, railroad man Richard Dix trying to ramrod a trail right through Lee J. Cobb's land. Cobb, also owner of the local freight service, opposes the railroad. Matters are complicated when Cobb's daughter, Jane Wyatt, falls in love with the railroad man.

542456,3,6303052436,"After stopping a robbery, a wandering cowboy is elected marshal of the small town of Broken Lance. Before long, though, he finds himself at loggerheads with an unscrupulous businessman and town leader.

 Richard Dix plays the cowboy turned marshal THE KANSAN, a better-than-average western from 1943.  The businessman, who is squeezing the townspeople and passing cattle drivers out of every red cent possible, is played by veteran heavy Albert Dekker.  Rounding out the strong cast is Victor Jory as Dekker's gambler brother, Eugene Pallette - on a horse and clad in chaps, no less! - as a friend of Dix and extorted cattle boss, and Jane Wyatt (Margaret Anderson on `Father Knows Best') as the love interest.

  The plot gets a little heavy - Dekker is cheating the town, brother Jory is an accomplice who may or may not betray his brother, Wyatt is a pretty hotel owner over whom Jory and Dix inevitably compete, a satchel of cash must be deposited in Dekker's bank by 5pm or something terrible will happen. A little much for 80-minutes of b-movie escapism, but the mood is lightened by a couple of unexpected musical scenes.  The King's Men, a Sons of the Pioneers type group, sing `Lullaby of the Herd' around a campfire, and showgirl Beryl Wallace gives a stirring rendition of `When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again' in the Golden Nugget saloon. The script is complicated, if not necessarily smart, and the production values are high enough.

 The mystery is why this movie fell to a public-domain recycler like Alpha. Richard Dix may have been a bigger star in the silent era than he was by 1943, but he exudes an acceptable amount of jowly authority.  My guess is that this movie was orphaned because of the unfortunate appearance of Willie Best, an African-American actor from the thirties and forties.  Best's character is named Bones, which ought to tell you as much as you need to know about how the script handled him.  Bones is shuffling, trembling, bug-eyed and thick as porridge.  This heavy a stereotype is uncomfortable to watch today, and thankfully not universal in movies of that era.  At least Best got a paycheck out of it, and was credited under his real name - my favorite internet movie site informs us that Best was credited in some movies simply as `Sleep `n' Eat.'  Mind-boggling.  Besides that bit of unfortunate casting, THE KANSAN was pretty good, with a number of familiar faces to liven things up.  The Alpha print is in good condition, too.",1147478400,6,2476,4.7995283018867925
542457,3,6303052436,"It is not a B-series film, but rather a C-series film, or even something somewhat more advanced in the alphabet. But you will get the crooks and the good marshall, the rotten apple in the community, in this case the banker, and we know that from the very beginning, the calvacades and other chases in the  wild  landscape with many horses and quite a few casual or planned casualties, a love affair and even a sacrifice for a woman, a lot of drinking and some card-playing, and all other typical western elements. But do not ask for subtlety in this film : even the timeline is not very correct and some shortcuts are longer, quite longer, than the longcuts, but, well, we can do with that. It is funny.

542458,4,6303052436,"THE KANSAN appeared in 1943, and was for all intents and  purposes, the last major role for actor Richard Dix. Dix had starred in the 1931 classic CIMARRON, and throughout the 1930s and early '40s starred in some well-done Westerns. Perhaps his biggest role came in Republic Pictures' MAN OF CONQUEST (a retelling of the Sam Houston saga). THE KANSAN is one of his better Westerns, and certainly deserves a viewing from time to time. The present video release, THE KANSAN, is a traditional Western yarn, released by UA, with good production values, and a strong cast, including Jane Wyatt, Albert Dekker, Victor Jory, Rod Cameron, Eugene Pallette, Clem Bevans, and Willie Best (who adds comic relief). The action is swift and true to form. Dix is very solid as the marshall out to clean up the town and undo the machinations of the corrupt clique that originally put him in power. All in all, enjoyable.
  This release is in Standard Play speed, and the video quality is fairly decent.",1059004800,3,985,4.7823529411764705
542459,2,6303052436,"This ""small"" western has the unusual plot of a town marshall turning on the corrupt politicians who put him in place and equally battling them and the usual outlaws.  Dix is fine in the role. Jane Wyatt  is love interest.  Victor Jory suave as the all too human villain.  Oscar  nom for Original Score.",933206400,3,302,4.518518518518518

7835680,4,6303052436,"This early 1943 western The is somewhat better than most westerns of the era. A man is hired as the town marshall because he is seen to be a shooter and appears to be the kind of man who will do what the leaders of the community, who are cheating the town people, want him to do. They are wrong. He arrived in town when the Jesse James gang tried to rob a bank and participated in the shoot out against the gang that was successful. he was elected as the marshall after being shot and unconscious.
The bad person owns much land and charges people to cross his land. He kills people. He has a brother who loves a woman who loves our hero. A question arises whether this brother is on the side of our hero or on the side of his brother.
There is a big fight scene in the film that is filled with humor.

7835681,5,6303052436,"A really good old style western. A B western ,but a higher grade B western than usual. If you like a good shoot-um up then go for this one",1405555200,,138,3.793103448275862

7835683,5,6303052436,"After some fancy shooting against a gang that invades town, Richard Dix is made sheriff, and battles wits with a rich landowner whose greed is strangling the town.  It is later revealed that said landowner has a criminal past back east.  Richard Dix might have been best known for his wonderful ""The Whistler"" feature films, but he is no less appealing as a gentlemanly man with a gun.  Jane Wyatt is also wonderful here as a hotel owner, and Dix's love interest.  She lights up the screen.  There is an astonishing saloon brawl sequence the like of which has probably never been equaled in a Western.  The detail of the fight choreography, of people punching and fighting and crashing into each other, smashing things over each other's heads, simply boggles the mind.  These films are often designated ""B"" Westerns, but they are often well written, extremely well directed and populated by wonderful actors.  And their simply stories are engaging beginning to end.",1400630400,,965,4.91358024691358
7835684,4,6303052436,"The Kansan, 1943 film

This is adapted from Frank Gruber's novel ""Peace Marshal"". The film begins on a street with a tall tree. A man yells a warning about Jesse's gang. Men on horseback ride into town shooting pistols. A new man in town shoots at this gang, some escape. ""Who is that man?"" John Bonniwell is elected town Marshal. He is a Civil War veteran. The Banker and Leading Citizen wants an ""efficient administration"" (to do his bidding). Eleanor Sager, the landlady of the respectable hotel convinces Bonniwell to remain. The Banker Steve Barratt collects tolls from travelers. The railroad put Broken Lance on the map as a site for loading cattle for shipment to the East. Banker Barratt owns the lands around the town and charges $1 each for the cattle headed to the railroad. Barratt owns the town legally and needs an enforcer. [This is all perfectly legal.]

What can the people do? A cattle stampede breaks down the gate at night. Marshal Bonniwell has a strong hand at cards. Would a jury rule for Barratt? The Hatton Gang is in town! Tom Waggoner and his boys will back the Marshal. A bar room brawl breaks out to provide action and some comedy. ""Your ten minutes are up."" Will bushwhackers ambush Tom Waggoner? How did Hatton and Nash get out of jail? Does Barratt have a plan to discredit the Marshal? At night a robber steals a satchel of cash. [No street lights.] A lady saw a man with a satchel go into the Sager House. Who can it be? What will Barratt do next? Horsemen chase the wagon. Jeff Barratt has a plan so Eleanor and John will escape. Will Barratt get back the land he sold? The Marshal arrives with news to overturn the judgment. Banker Barratt has a plan to conquer the town. But brother Jeff has a plan too. ""Bones"" races to town in a heroic effort to warn the Marshal. Forewarned, the people plan to blow up the bridge with dynamite to stop the Hatton Gang. The explosion stops the gang. The citizens form a militia to defend the town from the rest of the Hatton Gang. They succeed. There is a happy ending.

Richard Dix was a silent movie star in the 1920s who continued with talkies in the 1930s. Clark Gable resembled him. The use of ""Bones"" for comic relief reflects the culture of that era. The story of a town uniting against their oppressors would soon be banned from Hollywood in the 1950s. The book ""The Banditti of the Plains"" provides a historical example for this story.",1271721600,2,2417,4.513698630136986
7835685,3,6303052436,"KANSAN was made in 1943 and it is based on a book by a very good writer FRANK GRUBER whose one of the story was a base for movie BIG LAND acted by famous Alan Ladd.

7835686,4,6303052436,"This is a very good film of its type told with plenty of energy. Note the non-speaking quick shot of George Reeves as Jesse James in the attempted bank robbery scene at the film's beginning. Perhaps his part was edited out. The only negative is the Willie Best character as the usual African-American ""non-person"" prevalent in that era. The continual shtick of the rattling of the dice (bones) to entice him into action is extremely annoying and insulting, otherwise it's a good western.",1210291200,2,487,4.879518072289157
