CATTLE CALL

The National Lampoon banner has brought us some really great films over the years from Animal House to the Van Wilder films and everything in between I have enjoyed most of them. Over the years they have went from a movie power house with every film being a theatrical classic to more so of a straight to DVD Company with the occasional theatrical run. While this one is a straight to DVD release I do feel like it is one of the better ones from the company lately. I thought it was funny and very entertaining plus the three guys on here make a great team, as does the three women.

Fellas have you ever been so desperate to meet a woman that you would do anything to find one, the right one. Well if you have ever felt that way then this may be the movie for you, or maybe not depending on if you try to do this. These guys come up with an idea to hold a fake movie casting call in order to audition the perfect girlfriend. It seems that has been tried before in a very famous film called ""Audition"", didn't work out so well for that guy. But regardless of that they all agree that this is the best way for them to meet the women of their dreams. So the scam is on and it is working out very well until the girls learn of their plan, so they play the game right back.

The film is a very interesting one and has some very funny moments but the cast is what makes this film work. Thomas Ian Nicholas is very good in the lead role and plays his part perfectly and comes across greatly as a jerk. Diedrich Bader steals the show in my opinion with his off the wall character and how he plays it. Andrew Katos is good as well and like the other two plays one of the three loser jerks very well. From the ladies Jenny Mollen is great in this one playing sweet and then vindictive much like the other two. Nicole Eggert plays it just as well as does Chelsea Handler because all three women are just as good if not better in this film.

Writer/director Martin Guigui did a great job with this film taking an idea that has somewhat been done and made it feel original. The writing for this film was really good and funny and the direction seemed well executed as well. Now this is not a classic or anything but for a straight to DVD NL film it is good. The way the girls flip it on the guys is great all though it is a little far fetched how everything ends but hey it's a movie. Things end up crazy some times but the last scene in this film is priceless, I loved it.

Over all this is a good and enjoyable film that I think most would enjoy, at least those with a bored weekend looking for something to watch. Is this the best movie ever, no but it is an entertaining one. National Lampoon did a good job with this one as it is better than most things they have been putting out the last couple of years independently. Still even then this is not the best of those, but I recommend a rental.",1257811200,2,2918,4.112280701754386
