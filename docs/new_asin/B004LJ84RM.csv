8434428,4,B004LJ84RM,I got this because I was looking for an ab workout that I can use as a supplement to my regular workouts.  I was VERY suprised by the amount of options the DVD offers including the 3 short ab work outs and one option to combine the 3 for a longer one (almost 30 minutes).  I have not had a chance to actually do the longer aerobic options but I watched them and it's impressive.  I have done the strictly ab options on their own and as a group and they offer a great workout and are very easy to follow.  If you're looking for an ab routine to supplement your current regime or a DVD that gives you cardio options as well as shorter options this is it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.,1344124800,2,670,4.091603053435114
