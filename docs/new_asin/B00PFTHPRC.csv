8687720,5,B00PFTHPRC,"I love this show, bought a cheap all region player and now I can spend the rest of my life watching Mike and Edd fix squiggly cars
I not only got an email saying these were in Pal format and did I really still want to buy it, there was also a BIG note in the box with the same caveat. Good seller, on the ball...or been burned a bunch of times..",1518825600,,345,3.8055555555555554

8687722,5,B00PFTHPRC,"Love Mike and Edd. It's very cool to see their roots and to watch their personalities evolve.  I wish they were able to stay together.
DVD's will not play on players manufactured for the US market but will easily play on most computers.",1501200000,,236,4.488372093023256
8687723,5,B00PFTHPRC,Mike and Edd are entertaining personalities who work well together in showing us some of the coolest cars from Europe and the US.  This set covers seasons 1 through 11 and also includes Mike's Trading Up series.  I was prepared to have to purchase a region 2 player but it turns out I am able to play and rip them just fine using the region 1 player in my PC.  Looking forward to seasons 12 and 13!,1492992000,,398,4.142857142857143
8687724,5,B00PFTHPRC,"It was worth ponying up for a multi-format DVD player (used $48) that could play this monumental collection of the one show I just could not get enough of...It is fascinating to follow Mike's mechanic Edd China as he, ho-hum, converts a Datsun 240Z automatic to a stick shift, installing a rebuilt manual transmission Mike digs up for the project. Edd meticulously walks us through extrication of the camshaft which Mike takes to  to a machine shop have calibrated and then re-machined to a profile giving the engine's power a goose.
So...Mike bought the car for $8k, they put $3k in mods and renovation then sold it for, like, $16,500. You wouldn't catch ""fingers in his hair"" Richard on ""Fast and Loud"" pocketing a measly $5,500 on a car flip.  Mike and Ed are so engrossed in their passion for the specific vehicles they procure, that it seems the bottom line profit is secondary. The challenges that we shade-tree mechanics dread (e.g. chasing electrons; pulling an engine) is a cake walk for Edd and it is delightful to watch him dominate those challenges. For me this is Paradise Found: Feasting on this Car-nucopia!",1456185600,,1122,4.808290155440415
8687725,4,B00PFTHPRC,"This is a very good show. The only problem is that you need to make sure you have an Multizone DVD player as it comes from France. That is the only problem. We had to purchase a DVD player to be able to watch them. The DVD's are great if you like the show on TV. We were not aware of the DVD problem until after we had ordered the set. This information should be listed right under the Amazon listing for this set, that it requires a special player to watch them, so people are not caught by surprise.",1454716800,,501,4.02
