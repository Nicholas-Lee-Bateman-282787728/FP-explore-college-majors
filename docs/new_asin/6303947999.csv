7857039,2,6303947999,"This is a rather ugly and mean-spirited future noir. It is advertised about being about virtual reality - a particular interest of mine - but virtual reality plays little part in it and is poorly represented. It was filmed in Hawaii, but they seem to have intentionally picked the least attractive parts of the islands! The only comparable views of Hawaii I have seen were in the Dog bounty hunter TV series. The movie features repetitive and pointless violence, implications of child abuse, and no attractive characters. I would skip it.",1458259200,,538,4.923076923076923

7857041,4,6303947999,"Morgan Fairchild has a cameo role in this forgettable movie, which is just as well since she can't act, and never could. but she is lovely to look at. Tall, lithe, incredibly sexy, with her proud little breasts, and beautiful long legs and nails.",1395446400,,246,4.613636363636363
7857042,5,6303947999,Morgan Fairchild early movie that I have ordered of her films and like her start acting more before get too old,1386374400,,111,4.333333333333333
7857043,2,6303947999,"The story is a bit thin. Audie England's character (Eve) escapes from some kind of prison - the kind where the prison keepers don't even know who they're keeping, and the kind with a high-tech alarm system with more holes than a Swiss cheese. Even with that kind of start, the strain on one's credulity just keeps getting worse as the movie rolls on.

The biggest attraction may be in the moments when Audie appears wearing only Audie - and I have to say she wears it well. Those scenes are much too brief to make up for the weaknesses elsewhere in the movie, though. I wouldn't run if I saw this movie being shown again, but I probably wouldn't pay much attention, either.

7857044,2,6303947999,"Venus Rising is a thriller set in the near future, where an island prison has been abandoned by the authorities and the inmates left to starve. Years later, three inmates make an escape from the island and find themselves on Pacifica, an island paradise where bored rich people find stimulation in virtual reality. Murder and identity switching ensue, as the authorities hunt for the escapees.

This movie basically steals plot elements from Wild Palms and Strange Days and does a worse job than either of those two movies. For a start, the acting is weak, with a bunch of third tier talent like Billy Wirth and Costas Mandylor. Morgan Fairchild serves no purpose in this movie. The only actor with some salt was Audie England, whose only other roles seem to be in Zalman King type erotica.

This movie also obviously had a lousy budget. Even the scenes where they are meant to be entering virtual reality are hokey.",1123632000,10,916,4.754716981132075
7857045,1,6303947999,"This film was a waste of time. I skimmed through looking for someone I was led to believe played in it, but did not!

I'd give it 0 stars if I could. The acting was pitiful, at best.",1122422400,3,182,3.789473684210526
7857046,1,6303947999,All i have to say is this movie was  not very good period and even having Jessica Alba in it doesn't help as she's in the movie for like one scene that lasts maybe 2minutes. I'd pass on this movie.,1121472000,11,197,3.925
7857047,5,6303947999,To some this movie will not appeal. Some might even go as far to say that it is completely beyond redemption because of its views of the future and its terrible plot line. But I say its got one huge redeming quality and that is Jessica Alba.,973555200,16,241,4.148936170212766
