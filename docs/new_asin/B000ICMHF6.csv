8145169,4,B000ICMHF6,"This appears to be a good guide for pruning modern shrub roses, but I would have loved to have seen a section on pruning climbing roses, and the differences between pruning modern shrub roses vs. old garden roses and tea roses.  That said, the basic techniques will be useful within the context of other information about pruning different classes of roses, and I'm not aware of any other DVD that demonstrates rose pruning techniques so this one will be useful to me as a starting point, but tempered with advice from books on the different techniques required for different classes of roses.",1314662400,,593,4.813725490196078
8145170,4,B000ICMHF6,"Pruning is one of those gardening tasks that I always approach with some level of apprehension. Did I cut too much? Too little? The wrong branch? Unlike a bad haircut that will eventually right itself, a poor pruning job can be disastrous.

With that in mind, I can highly recommend this video. The instructions are very clear and I felt far more confident after viewing it versus just reading about how to prune and looking at diagrams. There's just no substitute to watching someone actually make the cuts.

James's teaching style is clear and easy to follow. I very much appreciated that he explained what he was going to do and why - makes for a much more valuable learning experience.

My only quibbles are the production values. The audio was unbalanced in spots, and the videography could have been better, especially with regard to close-ups and camera shake. These issues never became significant enough to cause a real problem, but the case for improvements could be made.

I'm familiar with James from his gardening book (which I also highly recommend). Hopefully more videos will be coming - I'd love to see one on tree and shrub pruning!

Highly recommend this if you're looking to increase your knowledge and comfort level with rose pruning. Would also make for a great gift - this video plus a rose bush would be a wonderful housewarming present.

8145171,4,B000ICMHF6,"This is a nice teaching video, presented clearly and covering a variety of roses and methods of pruning.  Other useful info includes how to differentiate between suckers and keepers, creating and making the most use of spaces, times of year for pruning and feeding plants and how to avoid most diseases.  James definitely has an eye for shaping roses and I esp. liked the short segment covering miniature potted roses.  Spend time with this professional and soon you will feel just at home with pruning roses as he does!",1300838400,,520,4.820224719101123
8145172,4,B000ICMHF6,"Step-by-step video on how to prune roses - and barehanded, no less! James Smith has an easy teaching style, speaks clearly and slowly enough to follow, and has beautiful hands (you're watching them on this DVD, so that's a perk).

Being a complete novice, I had to watch the video awhile to get a sense of what an ""outward facing bud"" was - critical to correct pruning! (Who knew?!) Also answered later in the video was when to prune.

Seeing the pruning done is easier than reading about it. (And watching the cats walk through the video added comic relief.)

The videography itself was the only weakness. The camera was unsteady at times, and zooming in to something happening on the back side of the branch didn't show much more than a stationary shot would have. Still, the shots are clear, and the teaching is excellent. Jim knows his stuff!

I hope he plans on making more videos, like how to take care of roses the rest of the year!....James obviously knows what he's doing and should make a series of DVD's for my ""How To"" library.
