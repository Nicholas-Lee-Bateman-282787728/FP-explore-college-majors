8309474,5,B001HSLTEK,Love this movie!!! Especially when the old man asked for his duereally awesome. It never  pays to ask a crazy psychopath for your due when she is holding a shot gun.lol,1494028800,,168,4.419354838709677
8309475,1,B001HSLTEK,Kind of stupid an American movie and it is a Region 2 DVD which means it won't play on any DVD player made for The United States. It has to be a Region 1 DVD for it to play on American DVD players made for the United States. This makes about as much sense as a screen door on a submarine. What was the significance of making this DVD a Region 2 DVD?  Be careful not to buy this if you live in The United States only to be disappointed it won't play on your player.,1456704000,,464,3.8333333333333335
8309476,4,B001HSLTEK,Love it.  Great camp.  Marilu is right on.  Pompous.  Unbelievable.  Coocoo.  Why isn't this available in Region 1 (U.S.)??,1409443200,,123,5.2105263157894735
8309477,2,B001HSLTEK,"sordid.  lurid.  way over the top even for a Lifetime made for tv movie.  marilu henner chews up the scenery  & obviously loves doing it.  if it were billed as a black comedy it may be acceptable, but its billed as a drama.",1348617600,,223,4.093023255813954
