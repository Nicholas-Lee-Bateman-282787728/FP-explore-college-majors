If the child you are buying it for doesn't speak or understand the language, you will not be able to use it at all and Amazon will charge you postage to return it.  I suppose I didn't read the information about the product well enough when I ordered it, so imagine my surprise when it arrived and I couldn't read a single word on the outside of the case!  I knew it was either Hebrew or Yiddish.  I checked and yes, when I scrolled down the description said the language was Hebrew.  I don't remember reading that as I was ordering my Christmas gifts. I didn't realize something like a product in a language other than the one I am using when ordering wouldn't be part of the initial information given:  at the top where it doesn't have to be searched for by the buyer!  Innocent mistake or stupidity?  All I know that I feel that the buyer better beware when dealing with Amazon.  They don't allow for any mistakes on the buyers part.",1231200000,,971,4.344444444444444
