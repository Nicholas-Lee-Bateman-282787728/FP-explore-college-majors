7811788,3,6301304799,"This film was made in 1976 when most of the Hollywood Ten were still living. Dalton Trumbo died shortly after it was made.  The film is The Hollywood Left's side of the story.  This is an interesting  documentary from a historical point of view as it contains first person interviews with many of the key players who recall from the point of hindsight their roles in the  HUAC Hearings.  Viewers watching the documentary should also read the book ""Hollywood Party ""by Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley to get a proper perspective.  In this film the Hollywood Left continues to claim they were innocent victims of a witch hunt. To some degree this is true, The FBI no doubt already knew who party members were and the 1947 HUAC hearings were more about Congressman J Parnell Thomas wanting to gain publicity. However the Hollywood Party also knew how to play dirty. Communist union leaders created black lists of Hollywood actors it deemed hostile to its cause such as Ronald Reagan and Robert Taylor. One interview in this film that was  interesting was Mallard Lampbell one the original Almanac Singers who left out of his interview that during the Nazi-Soviet pact the Almanac Singers made numerous anti war songs where FDR was a warmongering imperialist trying to provoke war with Germany.  The Communist Party and movement in America was directed by the Contern in Moscow. This has been proven in de-classified Soviet files made public after 1992. This film is excellent testimony made by the Hollywood left in 1976 but we can now see today their hypocrisy and in some cases outright lies.",1307232000,4,1585,4.866171003717472
7811789,5,6301304799,"This documentarty was made in 1976 and includes interviews with many who lived through this cold war drama including Dalton Trumbo's last. He died months after this film was made.  This film is a must for historians and film scholars. Regardless of your point of view, The HUAC 1947 hearings were a deep human drama, Ironic, Hollywood could not have written this better had it been a movie and it really happened ---to Hollywood.",1301270400,,429,4.797297297297297
7811790,5,6301304799,"This one is pretty hard to find, but well worth it.  It's got alot of really good archival footage from the House Unamerican Activities hearings, as well as some great interviews with Trumbo and several others who are no longer around to tell their stories.  A really grotesque and absurd episode in American politics that should not be forgotten.",1269907200,10,347,4.864406779661017
7811791,5,6301304799,"Narrated by John Huston, and with original trial footage, interviews with members of the original ""Hollywood Ten"" and others affected by the blacklists, this is a riveting documentary that keeps you glued to your seat.
It is an important film that should be seen by all interested in the history of filmmaking, and history buffs as well.",978825600,7,337,4.9298245614035086
7811792,5,6301304799,"Hollywood on Trial serves as a reminder to all citizens of the United States that our freedom of expression and our dedication to the Constitution has never been as sacred as we'd like to think. This film explores the events of the Hollywood Blacklist, during which Communist witch hunts were carried out by the House Un-American Activities Committee during the late 1940's and early 1950'. Alec Baldwin narrates footage from the infamous nine-day trial that saw dozens of careers destroyed as actors like Ronald Reagan and Gary Cooper testified against their colleagues in order to save themselves from censure. Viewers will see the outrageous, comtempible and inflammatory behavior of the Committee member; interrupting testimony, ignorant remarks at the witnesses expense, etc. Intertwined with this footage are interviews with actors who were intimately involved with the trial. The most interesting of these interviews is with Edward Dymtryk, a screenwriter who started as an ""unfriendly witness"" and later implicated 23 colleagues in order to salvage his career. Other interviews include Dalton Trumbo's son (watch for his description of visiting his father in prision), Marsha Hunt and members of the Holloywood Ten. This movie will outrage viewers with any sense of justice as they list to stories of moral equivocation, blind (and not-so-blind) loyalty, fear and dignity in the face of insurmountable adversity. I highly reccommend this film -- especially to teachers of American History and Government as examples of our legal system gone awry.",963100800,10,1554,5.425619834710743
