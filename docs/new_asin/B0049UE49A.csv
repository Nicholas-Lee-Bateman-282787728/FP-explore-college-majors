8419430,4,B0049UE49A,Don't know why this very enjoyable show has never shown up in reruns on t.v.?  It is still as funny as it was when it first ran back in the 60s.,1375660800,2,144,3.6451612903225805
8419431,4,B0049UE49A,"Very comprehensive collection of an early 1960's original.  The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis was ahead of its time in my opinion.  While simple in plot, the show always displayed a unique comic vantage point.  Some of these episodes were not of the best audio and video quality, making me wonder about the origin of this collection.  But to have this comedy show on DVD makes it worth putting up with the less than perfect quality. If you're like me and remember this show fondly from your youth, you will be amused to see Dobie, Maynard, and Zelda on the screen again.",1367971200,2,567,4.529411764705882
8419432,5,B0049UE49A,"Each episode has great video and sound quality.  They're even better than the original airings from the late 1950's to the early 1960's because they contain no commercials.  I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone interested in what TV programming used to be before its big decline in morals, language, and and plots, which have resulted in today's TV trash.",1367366400,3,360,4.885245901639344
8419433,5,B0049UE49A,"Vintage shows not digitally remastered, but simply charming and great condition.  Totally watchable condition.  Great seller, too.  Quick shipment even right before Christmas.",1325721600,8,175,6.521739130434782
8419434,4,B0049UE49A,Great to relive old memories of watchiong Dobie and Maynard getting up to all sorts of mayhem. Highly recommended in the great shows from the 60's.,1320451200,9,147,4.6923076923076925
