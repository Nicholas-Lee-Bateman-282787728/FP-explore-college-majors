2596296,2,B000G0O5F0,"This started out well but quickly went downhill.  Frankly, about 10 minutes into it, the kids were really bored.  I would save my money and buy a book.",1158364800,5,151,4.357142857142857
2596297,4,B000G0O5F0,"My son is really liking this video.  While the video only shows Elmo on the potty in the beginning, it focuses a lot on listening to your body which I like.  It has a nice feel of patience about it--it explains to kids that learning how to use the potty is a process, that accidents will happen and that that's ok.  The video celebrates potty time and growing up, getting big-kid underpants and going forward at your own pace. Unlike a prior reviewer, I love the part where the different children are talking about the different names they use for pee or poo or whatever your family chooses to call it. One of the things that makes Sesame Street so great is the diversity of people and thought to which it exposes our children.  And about Elmo's daddy having an accent?  I believe it is what one would call an African American accent.  You should have no problem understanding him at all.",1158192000,31,888,4.450617283950617
2596298,5,B000G0O5F0,"We recently purchased Elmo's -Potty Time- about a week ago.  We started the potty training process by letting her watch the movie a few times a day (Morning, Lunch & in the Evening)  I can't believe it, our little girl just got up during the movie and sat on her little potty and went!!! YEAH.  I'm sure all your parents out there can relate and understand the amazing feeling of your childs accomplishments.

Good Luck :)",1158019200,14,422,4.5131578947368425
2596299,3,B000G0O5F0,"My two-year old loves to watch this over and over again even though we have other Elmo videos.  We are in the process of potty training and the video does seem to have sparked an interest in the potty.  We now have success every morning and after nap time.  However, as a parent, the video itself was not as great as I had hoped.  I want my child to use terms we have implemented for ""number one and number two,"" and the song where kids express what they call it has confused my child.  I dislike the term ""urinate and pee"" and also ""dooky and doody.""  Hopefully our child won't repeat these.  I also don't care for the accent Elmo's father has.  It is hard to understand him.  The video does not really show anyone (with the excpetion of Elmo in the beginning) sitting on the potty.",1157587200,3,783,4.272108843537415
2596300,2,B000G0O5F0,"My toddler watches this video over and over... because it has Elmo.  But I am disappointed with the actual potty training content.  We only see baby Elmo sitting on the potty briefly, and while other puppets talk about using the potty, none of them actually do it on camera.  I'm not sure why; they're puppets, for gosh sakes!  How could anyone be offended by puppets on the potty?  This may be a great video for a very young, beginning potty trainer.  But for a child who has already started the process (and perhaps used the potty a few times), segments like the one about what words different people use for ""wee wee"" and ""woo woo,"" is entertaining for the toddler but a waste of time in terms of learning to use the potty.  For a slightly older or more advanced potty trainer, I would instead suggest the ""It's Potty Time!"" video, which actually shows kids doing things like sitting on the potty, how to wipe, etc.  This video is a nice Elmo video, but it didn't teach my toddler anything about using the potty that he hadn't already learned, and didn't seem to inspire him to actually use the potty.  It has become a source of entertainment, which is great (it never hurts to have another Sesame Street video) but it is not the teaching tool I hoped it would be.",1157068800,16,1267,4.45021645021645
2596301,5,B000G0O5F0,"you HAVE to get this video! I think I've seen just about every single potty video out there, and this one is far and away SO much better! My two girls love it, and want to watch it again and again. it has helped my 3-year old so much in terms of wanting to use the potty, i'm shocked! and my 6 year old just enjoys watching it because it's fun. The songs are so catchy and we sing them over and over (and some of the lyrics are just hysterical for us parents!) I've been telling all my friends about it. Really, you're going to love it!",1157068800,4,536,3.9722222222222223
2596302,5,B000G0O5F0,"My 2 year old LOVES this dvd.  He asks for it several times a day.  It presents potty concepts in a great way, and it's captivating for kids.  We haven't made a whole lot of potty training progress since we've gotten it, but it's only been a week.  I just wish it showed Elmo, or some of the other muppets actually sitting on the potty, since I think that would motivate my son.",1156809600,9,378,4.136986301369863
2596303,5,B000G0O5F0,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter had no interest in using the potty and we tried everything.  I purchased this video and it arrived at my house on a Saturday morning.  After watching the video my daughter announced that she wanted to put underwear on and she then used the potty for the first time that same day!!! She's been in underwear during the day every day since then and uses the potty consistently.

I highly recommend this video to any parent having a hard time with potty training.  Kids can relate to the characters they know and they make it easy for kids to understand.

The best $[...] I spent by far!",1156809600,166,610,4.3628318584070795

2596307,1,B000G0O5F0,"The DVD implies that the languages are ALSO in Chinese, Arabic, and Spanish. There should be somewhere in the description that the DVD is only in those languages.

But this is the best purchase I made in years...she went from being afraid of the potty to smiling and clapping with the proudest face in 2 days. I highly recommend this to anyone with little ones who struggle with this transition. This saved mom a lot of struggle and totally turned my little girl around on the whole idea of using the potty. Thank you to the brilliant minds behind this video. I would buy it again 100x over !,1509753600,,481,4.344444444444444

We have had to take a break from it for a while. There is a scene that a character says, ""No! Noooo! Noooo!"" Innocent enough the little character (Curly Bear) was embarrassed and hiding when she needed to go potty. However, my child got this little ""no"" and started saying it a lot in the same defiant sound Curly Bear said it in.

2596345,5,B000G0O5F0,"My daughter is 15 months old and we are starting to potty train. We used this DVD as a basic way to introduce her to the potty. It seems to have worked. Before the dvd she had some apprehension about sitting on the potty but since the DVD she sits on it longer and has used the potty 3 times successfully. She loves the music and will sing and dance along.

I don't know that i can attribute all her success to this movie because we also use treats and most recently we bought crayons for the bathtub and we let her color on the outside and she sits wayyyy longer. SO idk if the dvd was all her success but it definitely helped",1485302400,2,627,4.056451612903226

Also, we like that there are segments that we can cut off the video and watch more later (so its not 20+ min of video at a time)",1459209600,,385,4.216216216216216
2596528,5,B000G0O5F0,"We bought this DVD because my daughter loves Elmo and because of the great reviews. It did not disappoint!

We purchased the DVD in February when my daughter was 20 months old. We watched it sporadically. She really loved it!  In fact, she insisted on sitting on HER potty in order to watch Elmo's Potty Time.  After watching this DVD she was more interested in using the potty. It is now end of March and we have just finished successfully potty training her, in large part thanks to this video.

She loves Elmo, loved all the Elmo sequences (which are interspersed with general Sesame Street video and cartoon footage related to trying new things, growing up, listening to your body, toilet paper, washing your hands, etc.).  True, it is not Elmo on the potty all the time, it starts with Elmo leaving the bathroom just having gone to the potty, then reflecting with his dad about when he was a baby and got his first potty - baby Elmo DOES sit on the potty and makes potty sounds at the end of the song - then Elmo goes to Sesame Street and interacts with his friends Baby Bear and his sister Curly, who is just learning to use the potty.  Although some reviewers complained about the lack of Elmo, I'd say the DVD is about 50/50. Moreover, my daughter's FAVORITE part of the DVD is the ""Dirty Diaper Blues"" song, which is video footage of children running around in a backyard and a little girl uses the potty and then everyone rejoices about getting rid of diapers because soggy dirty diapers are no fun. I don't know what it is about this song, but the instant she heard it she started dancing around the living room like a maniac shaking her hands in the air and made me replay it about 5 times.

Overall, we think this video is great! We intend to continue watching it even now that she's potty trained in order to reinforce her achievement and also the importance  of listening to her body, and so that she can take pride in the fact that just like Elmo she can use the potty.",1458950400,10,1985,4.404371584699454

We've been struggling with potty learning, specifically, she doesn't seem interested in using the potty AT ALL. I think this may be helping her a bit. I especially like the song, ""accidents happen."" My daughter got really distressed when she had an accident when we were trying to learn previously (we gave up, it wasn't happening), and I think that's part of her resistance now. So that's a helpful song that I'm sure we'll be singing hundreds of times in the next couple months.

I wish this video was a bit slower paced, maybe had some more anatomical type information, but it's good.

He was really interested and it helped give him language about what he was learning to do. He also got really proud after watching it and would say things like, ""Big boys wear undies. I wear undies. I am a big boy!"" Thank you Sesame Street!!",1449187200,,344,4.3076923076923075
2596580,3,B000G0O5F0,1-2 year old child bores easily with this video and I don't think it's that educational. And it's annoying for parents to hear as well. Various potty books are better. Wouldn't purchase again.,1449100800,,192,4.848484848484849
2596581,4,B000G0O5F0,My daughter (2 1/2) loved the video and seems to have taken the lessons to heart.  Even my son (4) who is fully potty trained had a fun watching the video and it got him excited to help his sister on her journey.,1449014400,,212,3.9302325581395348

Of course my daughter danced  and enjoyed the songs about peeing and pooping even though she had no clue what it was all about.,1448928000,,335,4.55

Prior to this spellbinding, if not enlightening, film, the art of going to the bathroom remained a most elusively befuddling puzzlement; whereas, with some months of endlessly enduring and scrupulous study, guided by Elmo's bottomless well of wisdom, I am now delighted to report that I have nearly mastered - as I have occasionally overheard younger folk crudely, yet colorfully refer to it - ""depleting the lizard of liquid surplus.""

Thanks, Mom!  This is truly the most wonderful gift for which a middle-aged man like me might ask: the gift of wee.",1446249600,,692,5.2727272727272725

They also say number 1 and number 2. While my child isn't potty trained yet, I feel this helps reinforce the concept. Also, to me Sesame Street is less annoying than some other things they could be watching. I also purchased the Elmo potty.",1445817600,,398,4.32

But when it's explained in kid talk/terms it makes s BIG difference. My son is 3 and wanted nothing to do with any toliet. He was scared and showed no interest! We literally watched this did for 10-15 minutes and he looked at me and my husband and said"" I want to pee pee in the toliet, mama"". Wow! We eat him walk over and use his little toliet. We were elated!!!!!! He's still getting the hang of it, but I have to recommend this dvd to any parent struggling with potty training! It's awesome! :)",1444435200,3,663,4.228346456692913

It's Elmo, so that's a plus for my almost 3 year old. It's engaging and practical as it makes all aspects of potty training fun for toddlers and preschoolers. I like the repetition and the real life footage of bathrooms, how toilet paper is made, and no more dirty diapers song! We like all of the songs and it even came with a chart tucked in. I always highly recommend It's Potty Time by Signing Time.",1437004800,,550,4.055045871559633

The DVD makes potty training not so scary and the beloved Elmo character makes it that much more comfortable. As Sesame Street often does the show covers potty training words, making toilet paper, etc. As for those that are concerned about Baby Bear and his speech impediment. 1. My child had a slight speech impediment and characters like Baby Bear helped her feel less self-conscious about it and 2. Most children will experiment with speaking ""baby"" talk even if they never encounter a character like Baby Bear.

It seemed like the movie was everywhere. It talked about a lot of various things that ""big kids"" do and I don't even
Recall the movie showing the actual toilet, which I think is important. They need to associate that word with something
It needs to be familiar and comfortable for them. My daughter did not take an interest in the movie at all. I did like that the amount of the movie that they did spend talking
About potting training, they included wiping flushing and showing you how to wash your hands and cleaning up
At the sink if you make a mess. The movie is 45 minutes long and there was maybe 5-10 minutes of actual
Toilet teaching/training. Hope this helps.",1406505600,,784,4.340136054421769

And Orlando Bloom plays the most realistic CGI stapler that I have ever scene in a movie. The most riveting and climatic scene is at the very end, wherest Elmo sacrifices himself at the hands of Oscar the Grouch to save Big Bird's life during a gang fight gone awry.

But, that being said, I rented this movie from the library, along with some other books and found that this was what got him excited about potty training. He was ready beforehand, but this got his really excited! He no longer wanted the Lightening McQueen Potty that we had picked out previous for him (big mistake by the way. Let your kid pick out their own). So we got him the Elmo potty (his choice).

The songs are cute and fun, and the characters and wonderful (as is all of Sesame Street).

My only issue that I personally didn't like, was when the baby bear in the show refers to pee pee and poo poo as wee wee and woo woo (apparently that is what bears say). I found that my toddler started calling it that because they made it fun. They do explain that everyone has different terms for going potty, but it kind of bugged me.

They weren't interested in the story and they would basically just walk away from it after a few minutes.  My girls were more Disney kids and didn't watch a lot of Elmo, so it really didn't aid in potty training for us with either child.  It may be more effective if your child is already a big fan of Elmo, but if your child isn't an Elmo fan, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

As she loves singing, the song sequences are catchy, and she learns that ""accidents happen, and that's OK"" and that she should ""try and try again"" as she learns new skills.  I don't like to have my daughter watch lots of TV, but I've made the exception here because she needs to be potty trained for school.  She has lots of books on the topic and has understood the potty process, but this DVD addresses more actively the anxiety about using the potty and describes and shows feelings and attitudes such as perseverance and pride.  At first viewing, I was a bit skeptical: Even though I grew up watching ""Sesame Street,"" I was afraid the DVD of varied sequences would be too much information.  But with time, my daughter was following and also looking forward to watching Prairie Dawn and Grover and others as they talked about using the potty.  The gentle humor in the DVD is also helping my daughter take this sometimes stressful process in stride.  We use the catch phrases in daily life, and added bonus.

2596951,4,B000G0O5F0,"Disclaimer: I've only watched the full video once...

First - no, it doesn't potty train your child. (Seriously, did someone think it would? It's a DVD. Kids learn through action. Yes, some watching is involved, but generally speaking, they just need to do it. You, their parent, are their first and most important teacher. Don't pawn this crucial role off on a video!)

Second - I don't expect a video to train my child, but it would be nice to see Elmo, or the other characters, in the bathroom a little more. I mean, he's a monster, so he doesn't need to worry about exposing himself...
He does sit on the potty in the first song, but that is as a baby monster. Since they decided not to show anyone actually in the bathroom, it would have been nice if they covered privacy - something along the lines of ""When you get bigger, you'll go potty by yourself""  or  ""Leave your mom alone when she goes potty!""  (just kidding, sorta)

Third - I bought this DVD because I came across the first and last songs on YouTube. (The first song is Elmo's Potty, the last song is You'll do it, You'll use the Potty). My son loved it, ""See Elmo. See Elmo potty!"" Now, having seen the full video, those two songs would have been enough for us. The other songs are cute. We will watch it again. For the price, I don't mind that it's not an amazing video...
In the last song, they talk about how everyone will eventually learn to use the potty. During that song, Baby Bear comes out saying that she made ""woo-woo"" in the potty. When I watched it on YouTube, it really bothered me that she called it woo-woo; we just don't use baby talk at our house. I was happy to see that the full video talks about how different people use different terms to describe pee and poo. I want my kids to know that different people use different words. But I was also able to tell my daughter (nearly 4, who immediately jumped into baby mode) that woo-woo is the word Baby Bear uses, so she should still say poo. Just like our neighbor calls it pee-pees and poo-poos. We don't, but there's nothing wrong with those other words.

Would I recommend it? Sure. It's cute. It's under $10. It's Elmo...

She has decided she wants nothing to do with any of it but she loves Elmo, so we thought we'd try to use this DVD to get her more ""into it."" She's still holding back but we loved this! (so do her parents) It's very forthright on the topic, very casual. One of the cute things to me is that it features a baby Elmo in diapers with his dad. It's really hilarious to see them go back and forth about bodily functions in a very down-to-earth way. Our granddaughter actually began to watch and listen. Elmo, of course, is the ticket. Kids love him and do tend to ""tune in."" Our daughter called us one night (we had sent the video home with them) and said how impressed she was with its content. We will see how things progress!

She will often ask to watch her ""Potty Video"".  I like the fact that includes many different types of learning styles into the way that it presents the information.  It uses the typical sesame street muppet story telling along with songs and vignettes.  There is even a nerdcore song by McFrontalot about how toilet paper is made.

This was also the case with my nephew that I mentioned earlier. The DVD is full of catchy songs and fun, informative information and animation about using the potty.  If you are struggling with getting your child to potty train, or if you want to introduce potty training in a fun way, I would highly recommend this DVD.

2597012,4,B000G0O5F0,"You can't expect a DVD, book, or a doll to teach your child how to potty. That is your job as a parent, but these are tools to help. If you want your child to see someone sitting on a potty than take them to the bathroom.
This dvd covers not giving up while learning something, mistakes are ok, and steps like washing your hands. Its starts off Elmo coming out of the bathroom, than Elmo taking with his dad about his first potty time, which you see a short clip of baby elmo on training potty. Than we have some songs, talk about different word for pee and poop, washing of hands, accidents, and wearing underware.  Keep in mind potty training is diiferent age for each child, usually starting eighteen months. Try earlier or later, as a parent you know. If they aren't ready give a break and pick up later. You are the best example to show them.
My daughter is seventeen months, loves the video, but she doesnt understand everthing, they are babies learning. Theres a small clip with a song showing children being determine to master.... for example a small boy pouring a cup of milk, little girl trying to blow bubbles, even a kitten climbing stairs.... that the message I feel the dvd is trying to state.... keep trying till you do it.
Would recommend to add this in your babies library of dvds",1359417600,,1298,4.430962343096234

Baby Bear is featured as a ""big kid"" who can use the toilet all the time, and his little sister is in the process of learning, guided by babysitter-turned-vet, Gina. Gordon is the other main grownup -- a delight, as always.

The only part that gave me pause was the segment that taught my kids a whole mouthful of new euphemisms for ""poop"" and ""pee"". I actually learned some new words myself. (Have never heard it called ""woo woo and wee wee"".)

Bonus: the segment showcasing the toilet paper factory is both enlightening and introduces a catchy hip-hop/rap about the process. I loved it almost as much as I loved the original Sesame Street film of how an orange crayon is made.

The bottom line (*snort*) is that this DVD is hypnotic enough to give me a solid 20 minutes on Facebook without interruption. That's priceless.",1358467200,,1072,4.572916666666667

Obviously this video isn't meant to be a step by step instruction on how to use the potty, that would be a parent's job. What it does do is provide some context on the progression from diaper to potty, that it's an accomplishment to use the potty, and that accidents happen and that's OK. If you have an Elmo fan, this is a great buy for potty training since the learning happens in the context of fun songs and uses the same format as the other Elmo videos.",1354665600,,573,4.314814814814815

My son loves Elmo and will sit through the video, but doesn't seem that interested in it and it didn't change his desire to go to the bathroom what-so-ever.

Eventually, she skipped training pants and just wear underwear. Until she started preschool, then she has to wear pull up during school becasuse she keeps singing ""accident happens and that's okay"".

It gets her talking about urine and BMs.  Sometimes I think she doesn't want to admit that she does pee and poo, but when she sees the kids and Curly Bear talk about it, she feels it's OK.  We also quote Grover a lot, ""I've got that got to go feeling. I've got to go!"". We watched the video multiple times as a family and it gave us a common, family vocab for talking about all that goes into using the potty.

I thought the video was fantastic!  It finally made everything click with my daughter and she understood she wanted to wear underpants.  After watching this for a week, she declared no more Dora diapers! And that was it.  We never went back and only have had a couple of accidents since.  I do agree that this video may be most useful with a little bit older toddlers who are finishing up potty training.  And they need to love Elmo as well.  But the music was very cute and I got my daughter to keep coming over to the potty with me by singing ""It's potty time!"" in the same voice as Elmo's father which she cracks up over.

No such luck since they don't show any potty time at all. I wouldnt recommend the video as for us it was $10 wasted.

2597056,5,B000G0O5F0,"My son loved Elmo's Potty Time.  From the moment we turned it on, he was enthralled.  Within hours he was ""going peepee"" on his child potty, and within 48 hours he was indicating that he needed to peepee on his potty.  He still has a long way to go toward being fully potty trained, but this video has broken the nice and allowed the first stages of training to proceed.

The video itself is a collection of sketches involving Elmo talking about potty-related issues with both humans and other Muppets.  After each scene is spliced a video.  Some are directly related (Elmo's daddy singing about Elmo's new potty) and some are only tangentially relevant (a generalized song about trying at activities until you succeed).  The songs were a hit with my son though, and the dialogue scenes were just as helpful.

Topics covered in the video include potties being helpful objects (as opposed to scary), sitting on the potty for the first time, accidents happening, ""listening"" to your body when you have to ""go"", potty training being a gradual process that does not happen overnight, the joy of wearing underpants as you become potty trained, flushing the potty, washing your hands after using the potty, etc.

All in all, an A-1 video, and one that is perfect for a child ready to begin potty training.",1342915200,,1299,4.737777777777778
2597057,3,B000G0O5F0,I'm a bit disappointed by this DVD. My boys LOVE Elmo but it's not enough to keep them interested in this potty training DVD. I think it's geared toward an 'older' audience not my 27mth olds.,1342483200,,191,4.333333333333333
2597058,5,B000G0O5F0,"We have been working with my son on-and-off for months in using the potty, but he was always reluctant to sit on it without a diaper. He was so resistant around his third birthday that he'd say, ""no, no, no"" anytime I even mentioned or pointed to his potty. I put his potty away for awhile after that, and just got serious again with pre-school starting in two months.

As one last effort before just having him run around diaper-less, I ordered this Elmo DVD. When it arrived, I pulled out his potty chair, popped in the DVD and -- I kid you not! -- he had is diaper off and peed in the potty with the first 3-4 minutes of the DVD. He did it again two hours later and was as happy and excited as could be. I was shocked!

Obviously, he's an older child and we'd been talking about the potty for several months before using the DVD. But I still give it five HUGE stars for getting us over that final hurdle and in a way that made him happy, positive and very proud.",1341964800,,965,4.127659574468085

Not to say this video is to blame or I guess thank, but my son is just 2 years old and already goes to the potty multiple times a day all on his own. He loves this show and I do think it has helped him get use to using the potty. If elmo does it so can he.",1340841600,,448,3.4356435643564356

If your looking for a movie that ""teaches"" potty training to your toddler this is not the one. If your looking for a way to introduce the potty concepts to your toddler this is a great way to help them understand. I love that it focuses on hygiene and has an understanding approach to accidents. Just today my 23 month old had an accident and she was upset, so we sang the accidents happen song and she felt better.

I can see why:  there's probably about 10-15% of the video actually showing potty time, and the remainder of the video is not evening interesting.  I was hoping for a fun video that just shows Sesame Street characters doing ""stuff"" with or around the potty to help my child realize that the potty's not a bad thing.

Was hoping to have a elmo dvd for her even if pottying didn't work out. This DVD was quite boring and had a bunch of songs and clips of nothing to do with pottying. The songs might have conveyed encouraging messages about pottying but loosely related. She lost interest and I actually lost interest as well as it seemed to drag on forever. The upside is that the DVD does include this interactive book ernie potty book if one was looking to purchase that book.

2597090,5,B000G0O5F0,"My son (3 in a few months) requests this DVD by name. I can't say for certain whether the video is helping him, but he is learning quickly. Here's what it covers, in sequence:

1. Getting your own potty seat
2. It's one of the many things you have been learning to do by yourself
3. Learning takes time and practice
4. There are lots of words for ""peepee"" and ""poopoo"" (I think this part also makes the subject matter more comfortable)
5. Listen to your body and go when it tells you to
6. Accidents are OK and part of learning
7. Don't be embarrassed and hide under the table when it's time to poopoo :)
8. After learning, you get to wear ""big kid underpants""
9. After using the potty, be sure to wipe, flush and wash up
10. Everyone uses the potty and someday you will, too!

The first time you see it it's a little odd to think about monsters using the potty, but you get over it. And of course, it's done in Sesame Street style with all of the singing, dancing and (clean) humor you would expect.

As a dad, I really like that it includes Elmo's dad. He and Elmo talk about when Elmo first learned to use the potty. There's a musical number featuring dad and toddler Elmo.",1321488000,,1176,4.1946902654867255

2597093,5,B000G0O5F0,"I purchased this DVD because I was planning on having my 18 month old daughter start thinking about using the potty. We use Pampers Cruisers and we have a lot of fun picking out the Sesame Street characters on her diapers. Switching to the potty with the same characters was a great idea.

Towards the beginning of the movie Elmo's father begins singing a Potty Song. It's very catchy and my daughter began dancing. She started saying ""potty"" almost immediately. There is a seen where different children come out and say what terms they use for the restroom. I have to admit it was a little odd but by no means inappropriate. I think they did the best they could to make sure all children could relate.

The movie mainly features older children 3-5 yrs old. I think it would have been a good idea to have some younger children in the video as well. They do show Elmo as a very young child in diapers learning how to use the potty and I thought this was very cute and my daughter seemed to think it was very funny.",1319500800,,1013,4.354497354497354

After completing my research, I found that this DVD might be a good way to start. Especially, after finding out that there are limited potty training videos. Once I received the producte I was excited but I was quickly disappointed when my daughter and I began to watch the DVD. The DVD did not play correctly. The moment I put the DVD in my DVD player it began to skip. I took the DVD out and found out that the DVD was badly scratched and had water damage. But I guess this is what you get when you purchase a used DVD. However, I was shocked because I have purchased used items from amazon before and I was pleased. I quess I am saying that customers should think twice before you order used products. On the other hand, the DVD seemed that it would have been a good training tool for my daughter.

2597102,5,B000G0O5F0,"Keep in mind that this is appropriately titled- Potty TIME, not Elmo uses the potty. While they don't show people using the toilet much, it does have a comprehensive view on washing hands properly, using toilet paper, accidents, big kid underwear, how scary toilets can sound, different names for pee and poo and more.

 This is basically a beginner's introduction to using the restroom and cleaning up afterwards. I certainly don't expect a video to teach my children step by step how to use the potty, that's my job and should be tailored to each individual kid according to their personality. I will say that between the dvd and board book, I never had to chase my daughter through a store with her pants in hand because she was frightened by the automatic toilet flushes. She still jumps a little bit but she's gotten a good handle on it almost 2 years later.  Lol.

It starts w/ Elmo and his dad talking about how big elmo is and how he learned to use the potty. Then elmo goes out and runs into other characters, talks about washing hands, the sounds toilets make, and eventually comes to find Baby Bear and his little sister Curly, who's scared to use the potty but hiding under a table and trying to avoid going. They lead her into the house and to the bathroom, which is not shown, and then get excited because she went in the potty.
I really like that it's lighthearted and still maintains a certain amount of privacy for potty goers. After the actual potty training, teaching privacy for bathroom breaks is definitely the hardest thing. I can't say the number of times both of them have decided to show off their door opening skills while in a public restroom while I'm trying to get my 30 seconds on the potty.

I guess there isn't much that Cookie Monster could teach kids besides eating their teeth rotten or eating their selves into a diabetic stroke!

Let me explain what I mean when I say universal, my daughter is still not old enough to understand English, but she clearly got the message from this DVD and she kept saying ""I wanna go use the big girls potty like Elmo!"" Obviously she will appreciate the morals and lessons more as she understands the lingo but it seems to have worked.

I have to admit that it wasn't like those many toddler programs where they drive the adults mad! It was actually a very well produced piece of work which was put together in a very fun style! Even I enjoyed it as an adult... I could appreciate how fun it would be for kids! I especially liked the part / song where kids count out the numerous words they use for poop! Kinda fun for kids... various words for poop still make older kids in the family giggle when they hear them!

Overall, a fun and very useful tool for parents who are about to potty train their kids... just think if it can work with a kid who doesn't speak English yet, then it is bound to wok wonders with English speaking kids!",1313280000,,1438,4.338289962825279

I just couldn't watch it again, not because its annoying (its not), but because we have only had it less than six hours & I'm sure it will be on our tv quite a bit in the coming days.  I gave it 4 stars because I really don't know how much its going to help get her potty trained (we are on day 4 of a modified/semi-boot camp program, and she's been doing well).  I think if we would have had it from the beginning it probably would have helped her understand more on the first day.  She watched the entire 45 minute video while sitting on her potty one of the times it was on.  She sits completely still and watches the whole thing - she rarely sits still that long. We also ordered the once upon a potty dvd, and she could have cared less about it.  In typical Sesame Street fashion, the characters have age appropriate discussions about learning to recognize your body telling you when its time to use the potty, that accidents will happen and that its ok.  She also LOVES the Princess of the Potty book, and I do think that it helped her understand the process better (we have had that since day 2).",1311724800,,1238,4.180672268907563

I decided to get out his Elmo talking potty from big brothers potty training days, take off his diaper & sit with him to watch it again. He kept telling me ""its coming"" though nothing ever did. Then all of a sudden he peed just a bit on the floor while again yelling ""its coming."" So, I had him stay seated on the potty while we watched the video & tossed a small ball back & forth.

My 20 month old son has been watching this video (and asking for it by name) for MONTHS and this thing is on repeat at our house. Seriously. It is on while he plays in the house - he LOVES it. For him to get a cheery, positive message that will offer encouragement and reinforcement after he REALLY starts toilet training ~ works for me! The images are cute, there is a lot of variety, not unlike on Sesame Street (going from one short skit and 'look' to another), and there is a lot of reinforcement about ""as you get bigger, you'll use the potty."" Accidents are ok, keep on trying, wash your hands (I thought the ""how to wash your hands"" bit was a bit overkill, but hey - the little girl even wiped down the sink and hung the towel up, so maybe my 15 year old should watch and learn!), how exciting it is to be in ""big kid underpants"", different names for ""pee pee and poo poo""... I don't know WHAT people were expecting but it is cute, positive, entertaining, and stars my son's little hero. I think the people with the critical reviews are looking for too much here. It's Elmo, not ""how to get into Harvard"".  And btw, one day as he was watching, he did run to his Elmo potty, shouting ""POTTY! POTTY!"" and had his first little pee in his mini toilet. Something must be going right!  Lighten up, folks.",1299628800,4,1644,4.282958199356913

2597145,4,B000G0O5F0,"My two-year-old is as devoted to 'Ama' (Elmo) as they come. She lives and breathes that furry red monster. For me, I admit it gets old, but she loves him and, to make it even better, she learns from him. We've been having a serious lack of interest in pottying. She's not defiant about it, just utterly and completely uninterested. But the first time she watched this movie, she sat on her potty. The second time (the next day) she sat on the potty and used it. Now, it's not magic. She's not potty-trained just yet, but she's now interested. We still do sticker prizes and lots and lots of postive feedback, but the wheels really didn't start moving 'til we got this little DVD. I say, get it! Every child is different, I can't say it will work for your child, but it is quintessential Elmo, and it might just be the push your little one needs.

For those reviewers who had an issue with the 'potty talk', I can't pretend to understand you, but I will say that I didn't find it offensive at all. The movie is clear that there are lots of different words for waste, and, c'mon, they are toddlers. Give them a break.",1290470400,2,1115,4.3349282296650715

After watching this twice she was not afraid to use the 'big girl toilet' (with kiddie seat attached) to go number 2.  I bought it because someone at the DMV told me their child watched it once and immediately started using the potty, well I didn't have such great results, but every child is different, and I don't expect her to switch right away.

They are very clear about how not everyone learns the same time or uses the same words. I think it's very educational and cute too. I bought the Elmo's training potty with it and whenever he watches this movie he wants to run into the bathroom and sit on it (he's yet to actually use the potty but the fact that he sits on it is a good step since he will only be 2 on oct. 22) great movie for toddlers if they love elmo and wanna know about the potty.,1287446400,,569,3.871794871794872

2597154,4,B000G0O5F0,"First and foremost, I was sooo nervous about buying another potty DVD. I bought a different one from amazon.com and, not that it was a bad video, I didn't like how it didn't address the ""potty"" it only addressed the toilet and my little one is kind of scared of the toilet. This DVD is very good with songs and examples and the best is the different words for #1 and #2 (pee, tinkle, piddle, poop, dookie). I thought that was cute. My daughter wasn't really into it as much as I wanted her to, but she started using the potty and singing the songs later on I realized it was from the video. She followed me in the bathroom once and started singing ""mommy YOU do it, I do it...even my daddy do's it!""
The only reason I didn't give this video 5 stars is because it is quite lengthy. 45 minutes is a LONG time to keep children's attention and even I walked away from it thinking it would be over soon and came back and it was still on.

I love how Elmo covers everything and how everyone in Seasame street has their own little potty story. There is a toy at Toys R Us tyhat goes with this video. Its Elmo and hes in a diaper and he comes with a potty and talks about how when he drinks he needs to use the potty. Too cute! It's a great video and it helped my baby alot! Potty training is all about consistency and encouragement. As long as you stya on your child asking ""do you have to pee/poop?"" They will get it. Don't worry if it takes a while, ""They'll do it!""

GOOD LUCK!",1286409600,3,1473,4.093425605536332

This really helped spur on some interest in the potty training and she asks to watch it often. I'll admit, some of the songs are a little lame, but it is for kids, not adults.

It's funny, it has catchy songs (the song ""Accidents Happen"", with Grover and Elmo singing a duet, can stick in your head for days), and it explains all about using the potty/toilet, as well as the importance of washing your hands afterwards (which many parents don't seem to tell their kids).

2597158,5,B000G0O5F0,"I bought this video for my son just after he turned 2 with the hope that he would learn how to use the potty before his little brother was born- not a chance!  He just wasn't ready and he didn't have a one hour plus attention span.  Now, he is 29 months old and he loves the DVD!  He laughs at all the kids yelling their terms for what they put in the potty and sings and dances with the songs.  He uses the potty once in awhile, but isn't completely trained- I'm giving him time.  But the DVD has been a great help- it helps direct his attention away from his toys for a brief moment and toward using the potty.

I read some negative reviews that mentioned that they wanted actual ""instruction"" from Elmo.  Geez- do you want Sesame Street to teach your child everything?  The video has a lot of ""concepts"" and some funny ways of looking at using the potty- it is not an instructional thing- it just gets your kid comfortable with the idea.  I applaud Elmo for  the ""adjunctive"" instruction and leaving the parenting to the parents.  What did parents do before Elmo DVDs?  Show your kid how its done, people- don't be silly.",1284940800,,1124,4.3

What's wrong with saying dookie, honestly? It's true it doesn't show Elmo on the potty much, but it does offer lots of encouragement, which is pretty important.",1283472000,,582,4.4485981308411215

He had some painful stool to pass at one point and it scared him and he became afraid of going after that.  After much looking around and trying just about everything we could think of, I found this dvd online and decided it couldn't hurt to try it out.  I am so glad I did!! After watching it, my son was reminded it's fun to be big and use the potty.  Also, that there are other kids out there that are learning to use the potty and other kids that have accidents too. He excitedly told us, ""I'm not afraid to go anymore! Other kids are trying too!""
On this dvd, Elmo, along with many familiar faces from Sesame Street, talk about the fact that accidents happen and it's okay, just keep trying.  My son's accidents are non-existent now.  This dvd is in the same format as the Sesame Street show.  It covers all the basics of potty training and helps make the steps to going potty easy to remember.  It also addresses the fact that everyone has different words for pee and poop (however, those are the words they use to describe it most in the show).  They have a segment where they show a toilet, then show it flushing to get kids used to the sight and sound and then show a sink running and turning off, then a towel being used and they show all three of these things happening over and over to help cement the steps in their heads. Even my older kids (7 & 9) were entertained by it.  I definitely recommend this dvd to anyone whether you are just starting to introduce the whole potty thing or helping a child who has regressed get excited about using the potty again.",1280188800,3,1699,4.235294117647059

2597173,5,B000G0O5F0,"First let me just say there is no potty video out that your child is going to watch and magically be able to use the potty that takes time and practice. To successfully be able to potty train a child your little one must be able to understand and recognize the urge to go. This is usually when they come up to you and tell you they've peed or pooped in their diaper. Second this is a potty video OFCOURSE there is going to be a lot of talk about pee and poop because that's what goes in the potty right?! But were all parents we can handle a little poop and pee talk cant we? Now on to my review, this video is GREAT!  This video covers everything, from accidents to washing hands. I think most importantly helps you little one realize that using the potty is a part of growing up. I like how the video showed baby bears little sister was having a hard time pooping on the potty then the triumph of her doing it. The songs are very catchy, and cute. I started to show this to my daughter after she had peed for the first time so she'd better understand what they were talking about. I was THRILLED when we watching it for the first time and she ran over to her potty and pooped for the first time. I memorized some of the songs before she watched the video so she got even more excited watching it because she knew some of the songs. So if you're looking for a magic video your child will watch and all of a sudden use the potty this isn't it (and if you find one please let me know) but if you're looking for a fun tool to help aid you in training your little one this video will help.",1265846400,,1586,4.050955414012739

This was a smart move because Sesame Street has a long history of providing positive learning experiences for children, and this DVD is no exception. Elmo and his friends and family use snappy songs, and down to earth talk about a subject most of us would rather avoid.

Then we got Elmo's Potty Time.  He watched it daily for about 3 weeks.  Then he disappeared one morning.  When I went looking for him, he had used the potty all by himself -- having removed his pants and diaper all by himself as well.  That was two weeks ago, and he's been using the potty at least once every day since.

While this isn't a technical instruction video on how to use the potty, it is positive reinforcement for using the potty.  The songs do get stuck in your head.  I've found myself humming ""Accidents Happen"" in the shower...",1244937600,,743,4.205673758865248

It seems like some reviewers don't realize that this DVD does, in fact, show Elmo on the potty! The very first song shows Elmo on the potty through the whole song!

She LOVED this video and is one of those kids who you can explain something to and she'll do it, hence the video working for her. All kids are different so I'm not suggesting a miracle will happen when your little one watches this video. But seriously, whats the harm. There are definately no negatives in showing your child this video. Yes, some kids in the video say poop and pee and dookie....but it's for toddlers! Its suppose to take the stress out of using the potty. My daughter thought it was hilarious and it didn't make her a foul mouthed child. Its fun, happy, and outgoing. She is almost 4 and still likes to watch it. We'll be using it for our other child as well. Give it a try.",1240790400,,815,4.264516129032258
2597191,2,B000G0O5F0,This DVD is pretty informative about why and how to go potty. But - it drags on and on and I don't think the kids can relate to Elmo as much as the actual kids shown in other poty training DVDs. My son did not even sit through the video while he keeps watching the other one (with real children in it over and over again). I guess it is a matter of preference but it did not work for my son at all.,1240358400,2,398,3.75

She asks for the video, switches the player on herself and then goes and picks up her potty (which has elmo making a high five on it) from the bathroom and gets it out in front of the TV and watches the video. The excitement she has in anticipation of Elmo opening the door and coming out of the bathroom is very obvious.

We have been teaching her about the potty with books and toilet sessions for sometime now and then we came upon this video with its potty time song on youtube and showed it to our daughter and it was an instant hit. We had to buy the DVD and I tell you its extremely useful. It talks about pee and poo very openly and about dealing with anxieties that might arise during this phase.

She has been watching the video for a week now and today for the first time asked to sit on the potty stating a possible poop and sat down with her pants and diaper off. Though she did not do anything its obvious she is getting the idea of what its all about.

I encourage every parent to give this DVD a try and any other resource they can get their hands on that is able to get their child to engage actively with and make this phase of learning and transition free of embarrassment and filled with fun.",1240099200,,1301,4.154761904761905

He asks to watch it every day ( once a day) and sings along and even wiggles to the beat. I do believe this video is for slightly older children though. My son is 20 months and he is ready to use the potty. It explains ""almost"" all about potty and its ok if you ""don't succeed"" at first and its very encouraging. However, it lacks the actually introduction to potty ""going"" or the ""process of potty sitting"" . We have a couple of potty ""training"" books and they explain it so much better as to my opinion. Another reason this DVD is for older tots, because of the ""not so cute computer animated monkey in one of the scenes. I don't think it scares my son, but it definitely not so pleasant to look at and he wants to fast forward it as soon as that monkey is about to come up.

I work at a daycare and they play this and every kid under 3 loves it.  The only kids that don't want to watch it are close to 3 or over 3.  I love it has a parent because it introduces him to the concept of the big boy potty.  Yes, it doesn't show Elmo actually going to the potty but as a parent aren't you the one suppose to be teaching your child how to use the big potty and not a video?

We enjoy the movie, Sesame Street always comes through in entertaining the audience.  However, I do not recommend this dvd if you think your child will watch it and be potty trained as a result.  We love Elmo in our house (the adults, the 6 yr old., and 11 yr. old have been caught watching when it was thought no one was looking) and will continue to watch Elmo's Potty Time but I am no longer waiting for the miracle to happen.

But for my wife and I as first-time parents it was squirm-in-your-seat awkward to watch.  But then we went to give her a bath, and she sat down directly and deliberately on her training seat, exclaimed ""I go potty,"" and did just that!  We didn't even prompt her to try...she just did it on her own.  We hadn't even really been training her to go on her own, since she's still young for it.  Talk about proud parents!...it was definitely a potty party!

There is no more awkwardness now when we watch this video with her, and there is no question it has helped her (and us) to get more comfortable with using the potty.  With Elmo's help, she may even be out of diapers by age 2!...if that's not worth $12 or so plus shipping, I don't know what is.",1235260800,2,866,4.308641975308642

Now, when she's trying to do sth but unable to do it (for e.g. open a box), she will look at me & say ""try"".  Finally, she'll able to do it.

We watched our god son one night and because he is 6 months younger than my son I think that it hurt the process a little bit, so I bought this movie as an extra motivator for him. He loves it. It was that extra push to get him into telling me when he had to go instead of me asking. All I had to say was ""see Elmo uses to potty"" and he was fully on board. I would not recommend it for anyone who have very little tolerance for Elmo. But if you will walk through fire for your child then a little help from Elmo, and maybe some headache medicine for you, potty training is a little easier.",1232928000,,694,3.9642857142857144

It became a fun challenge for him to pee and poo in the potty like Elmo! It encouraged him to keep practicing and that he would eventually get it right and sure enough he did.  He was so proud of himself. I highly recommend this to HELP train your child.  The parents that expect it to do all the work for them are insane and frankly a bit lazy.

It *talks* about using the potty but doesn't really show anything... unless it's all near the end (don't know cuz we put on Curious George).

I guess we'll try it again in a few days or weeks but it's pretty lame for Elmo.  Nothing like how informative Elmo's World episodes are.  Just a lot of talking and some silly songs.  I recommend making this video like Elmo's World.  It would be a lot more entertaining and helpful for younger ""potty-ing"" children.  A lot more FUN.",1230249600,3,787,4.263513513513513

We talked about ""Accidents Happen"" while toilet-training, and still do even though she is now 4, though now we mean other sorts of accidents. Maybe your child is also sensitive? The gentle encouragement of this video may be helpful.

Some of the other reviews mention shock at the ""potty-language"" contained in thie video. Huh? What part of potty-training does not include words like ""pee"" and ""poop""? It's beneficial for your kid to know what other people say so they aren't confused at day care, school, church, by babysitters, etc. Sometimes we forget that parents are not the only people that interact with our children.

I always loved Sesame Street as a kid, so I enjoyed the music, some of the older skits (I remember the kitten going up the stairs from when I was a kid), the the funny lines snuck in there just for parents. Some of the dialog drags and I could do without the last musical number (aaaak! in tune next time, please!). But the TP Rap and Accidents Happen make up for the slow bits. I also liked the way you can put the DVD in and it plays the Public Television intro, and then goes right to the movie without annoying menus, then auto-loops back to the beginning.

Good luck on your potty-training adventure.",1225756800,,1387,4.562248995983936

2597238,5,B000G0O5F0,"We bought this video to introduce potty training to my daughter at the age of two.  She still insists on watching it at least once a day 7 months later.  To her it is just another Elmo video, like Elmo Goes to the Doctor, and Elmo Goes to School.  They are all three very similar as they are set up more like an episode of Sesame Street instead of an Elmo's World DVD.  The songs are cute and the video is very enjoyable for a toddler.  I do not think that this is a miracle video that will train your child for you.  This is more of an introduction to the process.  I think it would be great for the toddler who is scared to use the potty.

I would like to mention though that several other reviews have claimed that there are no scenes with someone actually on the potty...this is not true.  The very first scene of the movie shows a much younger Elmo sitting and singing on his potty chair the day his dad brings it home.  There is also a second scene towards the end of the movie where there is an outdoor party of sorts where children are playing outside in diapers and one girls grabs her mommy to go inside and use the potty.  They show her take her diaper off and sit on the grown up potty.

My 2-year old daughter enjoyed it from the beginning and is very interested in what Curly Bear did in her potty.  I only wish we saw more puppets/people/animals/monsters actually going potty.  There is quite a bit of talk of pottying but not much actual pottying going on.

I do think, though, that the emphasis on trying to go, not wearing diapers, and listening to your body work well.  My kid loves Elmo but this is the only Elmo concession I have been willing to make.  It does have catchy songs and she enjoys dancing to the 'factory' part.  The ""Stomp"" inspired section is her other favorite.",1214265600,3,668,4.610169491525424

She likes Elmo so I thought she would find this entertaining and educational. However, she got bored of it halfway through and wanted to watch something else. I got bored of it too. I found myself asking ""Come on, Elmo, when are you going to show us how to actually USE the potty?!"" There's a lot of singing and dancing about growing up and doing things for yourself, and there are shots of the potty but when it comes to crunch time, when at the end of the video Baby Bear's Little Sister goes, she does it behind closed doors. There are no scenes of her actually sitting on the potty. There are no scenes of her wiping or washing her hands afterwards. She just opens the door, says that she went, and everyone is happy. What's the value in that, really? I want my kid to see exactly how it's done. If they're going to shy away from showing kids the nitty gritty, then this is not a subject they should have tackled. It seems it's just one big long introduction on how great it is to grow up and a little bit peppered throughout on actually using the potty. Not recommended.",1211068800,2,1232,4.269230769230769

And that is what he is interested in learning to do right now.

The songs are cute, the sets are realistic, and I disagree with the Mom who said the clips in between the Elmo parts were boring--- they have great songs that go with them--- much better than the clips that often go with the less-high quality Elmo's World videos.

In the video, Elmo says ""it's easy"" and somehow, hearing it from Elmo did the trick.  He was pooping on the potty that day and hasn't gone back (6 months later we are golden).  He still says ""it's easy"" just like in the video.

I read some of the reviews and although after watching this many times I still have yet to see the scene with Elmo's Daddy without pants!  For one reviewer this was a concern.  But most of the time ""monsters"" do not wear any clothes so I am a bit confused on that one.

I gave this four stars because since I missed the whole Muppet babies era it would have made more sense to me to have Elmo using the potty at his current age, which I believe is roughly 3 or 3 1/2, rather than a ""baby"" Elmo. Also, I think Elmo should have been seen on the potty more often as I think that would have been a big motivator. For them to see their beloved Elmo using the potty too!

2597258,2,B000G0O5F0,"My son is 2. So having that out there, this review is geared towards parents of younger toddlers considering this DVD.

My son LOVES Elmo with a passion. I think ""Mo Mo"" was his first word and since then he's begun to say his ABC's and 123's. Elmo is engaging, reaches kids at their level and his show, Elmo's World, is short, quick, and has a certain layout that is comforting for littles. They like routine.

That being said, I thought this DVD would be great for my son once he started to show signs of wanting to potty train. I bought this and an Elmo Potty chair. Well we loved the potty chair but didn't like the DVD.

It's slow paced. Too slow for my son. And even too slow for me. I thought it was going to be laid out more like an Elmo's World episode but it's one continuous story broken up by older Sesame Street clips and segments that connect with the idea of learning something new but have nothing to do with potty training. Also, because it is a continuous story, there is a lot of dialogue by the human actors and that's when my little one gets up and confronts me, asking for Mo Mo and pointing at his Elmo's World DVDs.

In all, I would not recomment this to parents of a young toddler or a toddler who is very familiar with Elmo's World.",1203552000,2,1257,4.203319502074689

I read the criticisms that the dvd introduces different names for pee pee and poo poo.  That's wonderful!  My child needs to know all the information she can get in order to understand the world!  I want an educated child, not a child so protected that she is not comfortable with her body and the names for its functions.  Let's face it, the body has basic functions and we all have to use the bathroom, so let's know what dookie means, what wee wee means, etc.  Another criticism is that Elmo is only seen on the potty one time.

To be honest, it is up to the parent to teach that. Those who want a video to teach it are just plain lazy.

My daughter actually liked the DVD but didn't want to use the potty which obviously is not the fault of the DVD. So for us it would serve the purpose but my expectations were completely different. I thought that the children would actually been shown what to do and how to use the potty. Instead everyone only talks about the potty. Elmo (as baby Elmo) sits on it once but that's about it. What we see in detail is how to wash hands after having gone to the potty which is just mentioned and not shown.

If you're looking for something that gives your toddler a step by step guid to what happens on the toilet, well, the other reviews are correct; this isn't the place to find that. But the topic is explored in an entertaining, positive, and non-stressful manner, which is helpful for me with my son. If it becomes a battle, he digs his heels in. Elmo makes the whole idea more fun, so he's happy to try it out. Plus, he didn't seem to have any difficulty catching on to the potty process, and identified the DVD with his own potty training without much prompting from us.

The songs and segments are cute and catchy, and my son likes to ""talk"" to Elmo when he talks. I'm somewhat mystified as to how anyone could find it offensive or odd, because the language is age appropriate for young children and it's helpful for the little ones to hear words they recognize.

Our son (2) has learned his alphabet and numbers in record time by watching Elmo and his Sesame Street friends and so we thought this DVD would help him putting other things in the potty than his toy cars. Regretfully the Sesame Street makers felt they needed to fill the 45 minutes of show time with so many musical skits and talking about getting out of diapers, using training pants and underwear they forgot to actually show Elmo in the process of having to go, sitting on the potty until done, wiping and washing hands afterwards. Could it be that these mundane facts of life are now too close to the realm of unspoken acts for adults to discuss with young children? Maybe the page-sized ad for the Potty Elmo play set in the Printed Parents Guide is a hint you will have to invest a little more to actually see Elmo on the potty (we use the image now to show our son that yes, Elmo has to physically sit on a potty to pee and poo) Even the Interactive Storybook element included on the DVD talks in hurried words about the actual act of using the potty, but the image shown is one with baby Ernie holding his underpants slightly down, bending in front of a potty. If my 2-year old understood full sentences to that degree, we could have told him that without visual aids. And that's what it comes down to: this DVD adds nothing to my son's understanding of the odd little plastic seat and bowl other than that his parents and the whole of the Sesame Street cast seem to bestow it with great importance...until we either show him using the toilet ourselves or find a different DVD that actually is a little more revealing and a little less fluffy.",1193356800,102,1793,4.4363636363636365

2597289,4,B000G0O5F0,"The idea is great: Turn a process that can be a headache and a chore for both parent and child, emphasize the positive, and make it fun.  Unfortunately, this is not Sesame Workshop's finest job.  The video has almost as much filler material as potty-related content.  For example, did we really need two nearly identical songs encouraging kids to try doing new things?  Several of the other segments are recycled from previous episodes of Sesame Street, including the hand-washing segment which was re-dubbed to make a reference to using the toilet in the beginning.  I really think that's kind of cheap.  Incidentally, the only songs from this video that my 2-year-old will sing along are the ones written specifically for the video and performed by the cast.

  In addition, the skeleton cast of 2 humans and only a handful of muppets makes the street scenes look empty!  You get the feeling that everyone on Sesame Street was on vacation the week this video was shot (either that, or most of the actors and muppeteers didn't want anything to do with this project).  Well, maybe it's for the best.  I wouldn't want Big Bird giving lessons because birds are pretty filthy about their toileting habits and I don't even WANT to know where Oscar the Grouch goes potty!

Unfortunately, the dialogue uttered by the few cast members and muppets is awkward and forced (but then it's hard to write a script where you go from reading the Sunday comics to discussing bowel movements in 60 seconds flat).  Fortunately, the awkwardness for parents who are watching along is broken up by Baby Bear with some off-color jokes that will soar over your child's head.  Finally, the segment where Prarie Dawn reminds kids to wipe, flush and wash drags on too long (meaning that's when my toddler leaves the TV to explore something else in the house).

However, it's possible that our toddlers don't care about these short-comings.  As I type this, my 2-year-old is watching the video and becoming more excited and confident with using the potty regularly.  So, even with the low production value, I'm still giving it 4 stars and recommending it to Elmo-loving children who need something to get them excited about using the potty.  The video's upbeat, encouraging attitude toward using the potty alonw is worth the price of the DVD.

My daughter (2 years 9 months) identifies with the following segments (meaning she sings along or repeats parts of it while she's on the potty herself): The song where baby Elmo uses the potty for the first time, the frank discussion between Gordon, Elmo and Baby Bear about listening to your body, and the song at the end where the cast ensures that everyone uses the potty and that you will too.",1187049600,5,2713,4.7935483870967746

This is the first potty training dvd that he will watch from beginning to end.  He requests to watch it...I don't even have to encourage him..he just comes up to me and says ""watch Elmo potty training dvd"". He loves it.

Sure there is content that isn't quite related to potty training on it but for a kid who knows what to do but just needs an extra encouraging push from characters he knows, this is a great dvd.

She wanted to watch it 5-6 times a day and all of the sudden, she ran to the bathroom about a week later and we haven't had any accidents since.  We had tried everything, including keeping her naked which kind of helped.  I fully believe this video pushed her over the edge and made her want to be like Elmo and use the potty.

It is however very entertaining to my 20 month-old toddler with all the characteristic singing in Sesame Street DVDs. He loves it and wants to watch it over and over. He has shown a lot of interest in toilet paper and washing his hands since watching the DVD but still has absolutely no interest in the potty despite having watched the DVD countless times. It's probably just not the right time for him maybe later it will bear fruit. I personally think there should have been more to show kids using their potties, there is a lot of beating about the bush so am not sure the subject is very clear for younger kids who need more visual and less talk to understand things.",1181865600,,860,4.449367088607595
2597298,5,B000G0O5F0,"Clearly some of the parents writing these comments were potty trained at too young an age themselves.  The value of this video is that it IS funny, that kids DO giggle when they say words like poo-poo and piddle, and that there ARE ""filler"" songs showing kids learning to do new things in life like riding a bike.  The effect is to help parents and kids relax in talking about this tricky subject, and put learning to use the potty in the context of other new, exciting, but scary things that toddlers must experience for the first time - instead of making it the childhood equivalent of climbing Mount Everest.

This video is fantastic, and has been indispensable to our 3 year old getting comfortable with using the potty.  She has asked to watch it again and again.  We rented it two different times from Netflix, and even though she is trained now, she still talks about the video often.  So we have decided to buy it for her so she can watch it whenever she likes, and share it with her younger cousins and their parents.

Elmo has truly helped by filling them in with ALL the details. They cover everything from making sure you go when you feel the urge to clean up afterwards. There are also many musical numbers which are catchy and fun! A few of them have a real bluesy feel and my husband and I laugh when they are stuck in our heads and we can't get them out. It is true that there are fillers in there, but my boys and I find them clean and entertaining. I am even glad to see that some of them have the old school Sesame Street feel. I really screen what they watch and they have been exposed to VERY little so I feel that the comments about this video being inappropriate are going to vary from viewer to viewer.

For some inexplicable reason there is an animated King Kong sequence in the middle of this video that is unecessary and makes my daughter run screaming from the room. The content of this video contains too much filler, bad music, and the use of the word ""dookie"" (!)- and this from the team that brings us Sesame Street!

If you are looking for a DVD that goes through detailed steps about using the potty and toilet training this isn't the one for you.  It is not straight forward which is what I think younger toddlers need in order to understand how the potty works.

He has never shown any resistance to sitting on his potty or the toilet. Finally, at age of 2 years and 3 months he finally ""pee pee'd"" in the toilet. He loves the dvd and has been very enthusiatic about using a potty. The poor thing just can't coordinate timing with his bladder.  He's on the right track. I also recommed the Sesame Street cushioned toilet ring as he prefers the toilet to his potty. I also purchased the Elmo potty plush doll which has been great is demonstrating the need to use the toilet after drinking water. He loves helping the plush Elmo doll use the potty.

2597306,4,B000G0O5F0,"If you expect a video to show your kids all the specific steps involved in using the potty, you better look elsewhere.  Or better yet, teach them those things yourself.  The main objective of this video seems to be encouraging kids, instilling pride, and getting them excited about being a big kid, wearing underwear, and being free from diapers.  I think it is a good video to use when your child already knows how he/she is suppose to use the potty, but they just aren't all that interested yet.  Also, it is for kids old enough to hold their interest through a pretty long video.  My daughter begs to watch this all the time.  My husband and I get a kick out of it, also.  We especially like all the catchy songs.  And, it is great how nobody in the video is shy about talking about poop and pee.

Some reviewers complained about filler, but I like that so much is covered, even if it is just to get kids interested in how toilet paper is made, or about trying things and never giving up, in general.  Though my daughter isn't completely potty trained yet, this DVD has certainly piqued her interest more than we could have done on our own.",1177459200,3,1143,4.374407582938389

2597308,5,B000G0O5F0,"We decided to let my 21 month old daughter watch this prior to hard core potty training so that she would become at ease with the subject. It has certainly helped.

I was really surprised to read some of the bad reviews. For one, Elmo's Dad does NOT sound like Chef from Southpark. And if he was voiced by Issac Hayes, that would have been great too! His voice brings back fond memories of School House Rock (think ""I'm Just A Bill""). If it was intentional, it was genious as his character felt nostalgic to me even though I had never seen him before. Next, there is a segment in which kids yell out what they call poop and pee. It's funny. One of the reviewers was offended but I feel that if my daughter sees big kids and Elmo speaking so comfortably about poop and pee, then it minimizes the stigma and will make her more comfortable about it all. I think that being uptight about poop and pee makes you, well...constipated. And that is counter-productive.

OK, so, the songs are cute. My daughter sings and dances. The language is very clear and comprehensive with subtle side jokes for parents. My daughter gets the message. And it is very very supportive and encouraging which makes me happy. Oh, and Grover is in it, which also makes me happy.

I recommend this Elmo film. We have watched it daily for two weeks and I am not tired of it. Neither is my daughter. She went from pulling her potty apart in play to actually sitting on her potty (clothed). She has also told me that she is almost ready to try to use it.

I guess it's ok.  She likes it ok, but she has never asked to watch it or anything.  However, I was really disturbed by it, mostly because Elmo's dad sounds exactly like ""Chef"" from South Park (Isaac Hayes).  It is uncanny, so much so that I had to check the credits to see who did the voice.  As a result (and especially because of the subject matter), I spent the entire time watching it expecting Elmo's dad to say something really inappropriate.

It goes back and forth between Elmo and short film and animated clips that focus on independence and doing things for yourself.  But it doesn't really hold a 2 year old's interest and the song lyrics and such are overly complicated for a child of that age.

She voluntarily went in the potty on the first day she viewed the dvd.  I believe that it is a great dvd to introduce the potty and it serves as a great reinforcer.  The songs are catchy and enjoyable to children as well as adults.  The portion that expresses that accidents happen help to make kids feel alright about mishaps in the mist of potty training.  It helped my daughter feel better about having accidents.  I would highly recommend this dvd especially if your child likes Elmo.,1163030400,2,600,4.5607476635514015
2597340,5,B000G0O5F0,We have loved this video as well as our daughter.  She was 19 months old when we ordered it and her interest peaked about potty training.  It has been a big help.,1162771200,2,162,4.03125
2597341,5,B000G0O5F0,"I absolutely enjoyed this DVD. Of course, I showed it to my grandson who was quite interested at the time.  My Little One is still wearing diapers but at least he understands what a potty is.  The ""Elmo"" family in this DVD and the lessons they teach are wonderful.  I intend to show my grandson this again now that he's a bit older. (2yrs.) This is a *must* for anyone who wants to take on the laborious task of potty training. :)",1162598400,2,430,4.219512195121951
2597342,5,B000G0O5F0,"My son just turned 2 and had ""0"" interest in going potty. He had dropped out of potty training after about 2 weeks of trying around 18 months- he just wasn't ready yet. Anyway, I bought him this DVD for his birthday. He LOVES it and he watches at least once a day. Shortly after his birthday, he also got a terrible diaper rash that was painful to him and I started talking to him about the DVD and about how it would be better to put his ""poo-poo"" in the potty. Now that his verbal skills are more advanced and that the video helps him use the words he need to tell us when he has to go, he started asking us to go. We talk about the DVD and how Elmo is a big boy and goes potty all the time. He even had an accident during nap one day and was crying about missing the potty and I started singing the ""Accidents Happen"" song from the DVD and he brightened right up instead of giving up. The point is that the DVD will not potty train your kid for you but it opens up discussion and gives your child words to use. It also makes them feel ok if they have an accident and stresses that the important thing is trying. I think it's very reassuring to my son and he is doing so great now. Also, the songs are corny yet catchy. And, come on, if you can't laugh about Sesame Street being sponsored today by the letter ""p"" and the number ""2""- then you are missing your humor chip! :)",1162166400,12,1375,4.003636363636364
2597343,5,B000G0O5F0,"Our 3 year old daughter loves it...and we think it is an excellent product.  A nice change from the basic ""only seeing the kids on the potty"" shows.  There is lots to learn in this...our daugther loves the part about how toilet paper is made.  The story is educational, encouraging, and fun.  We think this has helped her interest in using the potty very much...five stars from this very pleased family!",1162166400,3,403,4.633802816901408
2597344,5,B000G0O5F0,"I am a 25 year old mother of a 17 month old boy and we absolutely LOVE this video!  We are in the very early stages of potty training, and since my son adores all Sesame Street characters, I thought this would be a good supplement to the training that his father and I give him.  I have to say that most parents are right to say that there is not a lot of actual ""potty footage,"" but I think that this video is more of a tool to encourage toddlers instead of a graphic ""how-to"" guide--isn't that our job?  The content presented here is highly positive words from Muppets that apparently potty like pros.  They discuss wearing diapers, listening to your body, having accidents, and of course, wiping, flushing and washing up.  There are segments that do not relate directly to using the potty, but the moral of those clips, I think, is that ""it takes time, but you can do anything with practice.""  I also really appreciate the fact that Elmo's dad is the parent in the show that talks about training with his son--I like to see daddies taking part in important milestones like this.  As for terms used to describe ""what you put in the potty,"" if you don't like them, teach your kids what YOU want them to say.  Unfortunately for all of you that cringe at a less than proper word being uttered in front of your child, you might as well get used to the idea--if you plan on letting your child spend any time with other kids, they are going to hear a lot worse than the word ""dookie.""  Your influence will ultimately reign supreme.  So parents, if you would like a fun and unintimidating supplement to go along with your adventures in potty training, this is a great choice.",1161734400,214,1670,4.392857142857143
2597345,5,B000G0O5F0,"My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves this movie. She asks for it everyday. She has also shown a much increased intrest in the potty since seeing this, although she is not yet potty trained. I am quite surprised by the negative reviews here. The movie does cater to a large audience by covering ways different families say potty terms. I also like all of the different clips that talk about other aspects of potty training like flushing and washing our hands. Those are also things our little ones are learning. If you love Sesame Street, you'll love this!",1160611200,5,558,4.646464646464646
2597346,2,B000G0O5F0,"This video is poorly made. I am a daycare provider and I was excited when I saw this video came out. I brought and watched it first without the kids. I thought it was kinda weird. It has a LOT of filler than has nothing to do with potty training. Which would have been ok expect it's BORING. One spot is about were toilet paper comes from. I don't know any 2 or 3 yr old who cares. The potty training songs are not cute or catchy. There are some parts of this video that can gives kids bad ideas such as putting their hands down their pants, pouring milk and not holding the cup, and playing with toilet paper. There also was a LONG argument between Elmo and Prairie Dawn that was useless. I really discourage  my kids from having arguments. This video seem to be made for older kids than those who need to be potty trained. I have let my daycare kids watch this video. They are bored during the spots I was bored during and are not excited during the rest of the video. Half the time the will not watch the show. It's Potty Time ~ Duke Family Series is a much better video. This the video which train my daughter when she as 18 months and my daycare kids LOVE it. It does have some filler but my daycare kids LOVE it and cheer when I put it on.",1160092800,4,1245,4.081632653061225
2597347,1,B000G0O5F0,"I agree with the other reviewers.  THERE IS LITTLE IF ANY POTTY TRAINING CONTENT.  Elmo and friends just chants ""potty is good"", ""potty is cool"", etc. throughout the overly long video.  Can you really convince a toddler who has always been in diapers that just because ""potty is cool"" to go pee/poop in the toilet?  I think not.

The video is also overly long, close to an hour.  My son who LOVES Elmo got bored after about 20 minutes.  I am glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste any money buying this video.",1159315200,17,528,4.381443298969073
2597348,2,B000G0O5F0,"First of all, the video itself is okay, and probably entertaining to most children.  Older children, would probably actually ""understand"" the video.  But, as for POTTY TRAINING content... it would have received ""0"" Stars, if I was basing it on that alone.  I agree with another reviewer who suggested having Elmo and the other puppets actually ON a potty more frequently.",1158969600,4,371,5.049180327868853
2597349,3,B000G0O5F0,"We bought this video at the tale end of our potty training experience.  My son had been ""almost potty trained"" for months and months and we were down to crunch time - 4 weeks to get him seriously trained so he could start preschool.  I thought this video would be the push he needed.

I think this video bored him.  He watched it for maybe 10 minutes and then went outside to play in his sandbox.

I was hoping for something of an ""Elmo's World"" format...  I really don't know what Elmo's World does potty time would be like, but that's what I was hoping for.  This is NOT Elmo's World, even though it has Elmo.

This video has a lot of filler that IMO tends to become boring after a while and not have any impact on encouraging your kid to use the potty.  A segment on how toilet paper is made, a segment where various bathroom fixtures turn on and off on their own...  etc.  Stuff that is kind of entertaining but not useful.  I think it would be better to focus just on using the potty here, maybe show more puppets going as someone suggested.

Two things I really didn't like about this video were the ""dirty diaper blues"" segment where they show a bunch of kids running around in diapers and then looking unhappy, presumably because they are wet...  then at the end, one girl actually runs inside the house to use the toilet.  Every single kid is in disposable diapers.  As a cloth diapering mom, I would like to have seen at least a nod towards cloth diapering.

The other thing I didn't like was when they had kids giving other words for ""pee"" or ""poop""...  one boy says ""I call it DOOKIE!"" with a big grin.  Maybe I am just getting OLD (I am 29) but I do NOT think children should be using the word dookie and I can't imagine anyone using that to toilet train.  Dookie is a word that I first heard in 5th grade and it was one of those words that isn't exactly a swear word but still gets a rise out of adults.  I mean, I don't think Green Day named their album ""Dookie"" because it is a family-friendly word.  Anyway, I guess I am an adult now because it sure got a rise out of me.  Yeah, yeah, I know our kids can and will hear words we don't want them to hear - I'll even confess my son picked up at least one choice word from me - but I like to think of Sesame Street as being a ""place"" we don't have to worry about our kids hearing such things.  Just my opinion.

One thing I did like about this video was when the baby bear (not Baby Bear but Baby Bear's baby sister Curly- yeah, I can't figure that logic out either) goes and hides under a table because she had to poop and Gina came along and convinced Curly it was OK to come inside and use the potty.  This was a favorite caper of my son's for some time...  he would go outside and stand behind the bushes or in a certain spot of the yard and we KNEW it was because he had to poop.  FRUSTRATING!!!  I liked seeing a video give a nod to this quirk - none of the others we have seen did this.

All in all, I can't say I reccomend this video.  It was mildly entertaining (oddly enough now that my son is trained he watches is over and over, go figure) and mildly informative/encouraging, but I don't think it has any merits over any other videos we have seen - chances are you can get a few from your local library, which is what we did before buying this.

If this video has any merit at all, I think it may be in getting a younger child interesting in the process - not getting an almost-trained child to wrap things up.  My son is 2y10m...  maybe at 2 this would have been more useful but I really don't know.  Turns out what we needed to do was lay down the law and say no more diapers and after 3 days with a few accidents, he was trained.  Your milage may very.",1158451200,83,3730,4.089531680440771
