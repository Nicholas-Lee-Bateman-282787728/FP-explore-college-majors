2910837,5,B000TVUBI6,"this is fabulous -- most of us don't yet have an hour in the morning for an entire yoga session - this 10 minutes flies by and leaves you wishing for more. It is safe, simplified for beginners and less than flexible bodies and mariel is pleasant to follow. I bought and re-sold 4 yoga products in my search for just this very thing.  a keeper.",1202515200,17,343,4.196969696969697

8211201,2,B000TVUBI6,"I would love to say I loved this, (because I love both Rodney Yee and Mariel Hemingway) and I love yoga, but this was not one of my favorites. I feel they are all starting to look and feel the same. No creativity or imagination put into the 10 minute routine.",1488153600,,259,4.098039215686274
8211202,5,B000TVUBI6,Great dvd,1487980800,,9,4.0
8211203,5,B000TVUBI6,"Great video. I bought it because I like Rodney Yee, but was surprised because I like the a.m. video more. I use it everyday.  It is very easy to take just 11 minutes of my morning routine. Also, I feel so more energized after completing it. It's great to start the day! Buy it.",1461196800,,277,4.12962962962963

8211205,5,B000TVUBI6,"Love the AM energizer with Mariel Hemingway. Actually 12 min in length, it is just the practice to use when my time is limited. Gets me up and going. I must confess, I have not yet done the PM de-stressor, but knowing Rodney Yee, I am sure it is good.",1406505600,2,251,4.04
8211206,5,B000TVUBI6,"I love this DVD - I consider myself a lazy yoga person, and this DVD is perfect for me, it is mellow and quick and there is basically no reason in the world to not fit in the ten minutes.  You will feel good doing it and afterwards!  It is gentle and perfect for the reluctant exercise person.",1395187200,7,293,4.0344827586206895
8211207,4,B000TVUBI6,"I wanted some short sequences, because I find it hard to want to exercise early in the morning or before bed. These are just the right length. The nighttime one is so easy that it doesn't seem like yoga. I'm not a big fan of the morning one, but maybe it's because it's not with Rodney Yee. I really wish it contained more than the 2 sessions.",1382054400,3,343,4.134328358208955
8211208,5,B000TVUBI6,"I purchased this DVD primarily for the morning energizer. I have Rodney Yee's AM Yoga for your week&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-M-Yoga-for-Your-Week/dp/B000YV1L4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.M. Yoga for Your Week</a>&nbsp;and love all of these routines. However I follow yoga with a trip to the gym for cardio so I don't always have the 25 minutes for these routines. The AM Energizer is a great routine. It definitely is energizing and fun. Perfect to get a yoga primer in before the gym.

I have not tried the PM de-stressor with Rodney yet. I am a fan of Rodney's and had wished he had done both routines. However I was very impressed with Mariel.",1362009600,9,700,5.542056074766355
8211209,5,B000TVUBI6,Love!!! Has helped with my daily stress greatly ! It is easy and could be done by anyone of any age or athletic ability.,1350000000,3,120,4.041666666666667
