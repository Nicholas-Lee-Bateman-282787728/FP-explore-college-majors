2430839,5,B000BO0LPO,"I was also confused about the two different DVD covers that are being sold with this movie, and to answer an earlier question:  No, January Jones (the old Missy) isn't in Love's Long Journey, no matter the cover picture.

I was disappointed that she was not in it since she did a fantastic job in Love's Enduring Promise, but I still give this movie 5 stars because all three of these movies are my favorites.  Erin Cottrell did a fine job acting as Missy, and I can't wait to see more when they are made.  I am going to purchase the books also-because the book is always better! :)",1144281600,3,582,4.3119266055045875

2430842,5,B000BO0LPO,"We are confused.  There seem to be 2 versions of this movie being advertised...one with the old Missy on the cover and one with the new Missy.  Are they two different movies?  We watched the one on Hallmark, with the new Missy, so can't understand why there also seems to be one with the old Missy.  Can anyone explain?",1142294400,3,319,4.3559322033898304
2430843,5,B000BO0LPO,I have seen all the prievious movies in the series and have read some of the books.  This show is a good wholesome film that the whole family can watch. When I watch these films I often look back to the show Little House on the prairie.  I find that these movies are a modern take on Littlehouse on the prairie.  These are one of my faverite movies so I give it a five star.,1141862400,11,374,3.96
2430844,5,B000BO0LPO,"This is the 3rd movie in the Love Comes Softly series.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Every time any of the movies are on the Hallmark channel, my husband and I drop everything to watch them.  I highly recommend all three movies.  They are heart-warming stories that make you feel good inside.",1139443200,23,292,4.666666666666667
2430845,5,B000BO0LPO,"Out of the three Love Comes Softly movies made, this one is my most favorite. Very touching, but most inaccurate from the original book by Jannette Oke. Neitherless I enjoyed it!

After 2 years of marriage, Missie and Willie have arrived at the land where they are to establish a home/ranch. While Willie goes off to find some ranchhands, Missie befriends her Native American neighbor Miriam who is a blessing from God b/c Missie is pregnant and w/out a doctor around. The story also focuses upon these 3 mysterious men who seem to be gangsters. Later on they discover that there is money hidden somehwere on Misse and Willie's ranch. They hold everyone hostage while searching out for the money. How will Missie and Willie handle this? Well just watch it and you'll find out!

If you have read the book there are TONS of differences. The first half of the book focuses upon their journey on the trail while in the movie they have arrived at their destination within the first 10 minutes. Missie gave birth in a little city Willie left her at in the book and she names the baby Nathan not Matthew like she did in the movie. And Miriram does not exist in the book. The little boy who they adopted, and the 3 gangsters were not present in the book either I believe. To me they made most of the movie's plot up, while keeping some elements from the book--God's faithfulness, love, and I love the last line from the movie Missie says--""To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.""

All in all I reccommend the movie to fans of the Little House on the Praire series and the Love Comes Softly book series by the amazing Janette Oke. Go read the book if you never had...it is truly beautiful. Love's Abiding Joy, the 4th book in the series is in the works right now of being produced into a movie. It will premiere later this year and I am looking very forward to it! :-D",1138406400,100,1896,4.442528735632184

2430866,1,B000BO0LPO,"I am not the biggest fan of the Love Comes Softly series. Some of them (of the ones I have watched) are good, but this one is so bad it literally hurts to watch it. First of all Erin Cottrell was waaaaay to old to play the role of Missy LaHaye. It was obvious that Logan Bartholomew was allot younger than Erin(eight years younger) and it just looked awkward and a little bit gross. They either needed a younger Missy or an older Willie. The movie was unrealistic and just plain stupid and pointless. The fact that a group of THREE men ALL armed would simply turn tail from ONE man with ONE gun and his PREGNANT wife was simply laughable. And what was with the whole dramatic scene where Willie and Missy are fighting after Missy's visit to the Indians. WHY was Missy crying again in that scene? Trust me, I really did try to understand the reason, but it made no sense. What I would want say to a woman who cries over something like that is simply this ""BUCK UP WOMAN!"" In short the movie stinks. There are better ones in the series to spend your money on.",1430870400,,1057,4.263681592039801

For the price of a few cups of coffee at your favorite Barrista's, you can get all ten movies.

But Missie and Willie see themselves as a means to bring the love of Christ to the land.  Missie discovers she is pregnant at the beginning, but doesn't want to worry Willie.

2430915,3,B000BO0LPO,"Well, once again, like all the other movies in the series, the movie is COMPLETELY different from the book.
It starts out with Missie and Willie leaving the wagon train alone for a small town not far from their property. Now, seriously, were they the ONLY people who wanted to go to town?!
Missie is pregnant in this one, fyi.
So they arrive on their property and voila!!! There is a nice old house sitting there all ready for them to move into. Unlike the book, where they had to live in a tiny sodhouse for two winters before they could afford to build a house.
In the movie, Missie can't cook to save her life. Now, really. If her cooking was THAT bad, what did they eat on the trail? And if you were a pioneer woman, would you have allowed your daughter to go on a trip which was thousands of miles long without teaching her how to cook decently? Marty wouldn't have. Besides, in the previous movie, she tells Willie that she makes really good cornbread (or something.)
Missie later meets her Indian neighbor, Miriam, who (surprise, surprise!) speaks perfect English with a perfect American accent. (There are no Indians in the book.)
When they go to town, notice that all the deciduous trees are still green and pretty in the middle of winter.
The LaHayes meet Jeff and Sonny Huff, who are brothers. Sonny is a guy who steals money so that he and his little brother can have their own ranch one day. When Sonny and some other gangsters try to steal the LaHaye's hidden money, Sonny is shot by one of the bad guys and dies, after which the LaHayes adopt Jeff (which you know is going to happen from the beginning anyway.)
Missie gives birth to a boy whom they name Matthew after Willie's dead younger brother who never existed in the book. Once again, like in so many movies of this type, you hear the baby crying, and five seconds later, the door opens, revealing a smiling Missie who is sitting up ten seconds after having the baby, and everything has been magically cleaned up, leaving no traces of blood or any other mess. Missie's hair is perfectly neat, too. And the baby looks like at least a three- or four-month-old.
So, yeah. Just some thoughts. This is a very nice movie, sweet, touching, and even exciting in some parts, but all those realistic details that make a movie great are MISSING. You laugh in all the wrong parts because it is so fake sometimes. But it has a nice message, and in the long run, is worth watching. Just don't overexpect.",1347753600,,2461,4.471111111111111
2430916,5,B000BO0LPO,"I saw this movie for the very first time visiting my pops. I never heard of this movie nor that there was a book version. It was a beautiful movie, but I was also shocked that it was unlike any other western setting, where it was not gunshots every few seconds, which did me a favor, for I not like violence, anyway. It was about a newlywed couple, and Missie feeling like her encounter with a Native American is from God. The part near then end had me about to bawl, for a young man confesses his sins before God, but something sad happens right after he confesses. But his confession, and how the people this man has hurt make known he is receiving forgiveness is so very touching. This movie takes place in 1878 to 1879. And, you see Missie's husband for the most part is a real good man to her and truly loves her the way most women of today wish their man loved them.

2430923,5,B000BO0LPO,"Whenever you see the words ""based on"" you know the film isn't going to follow the original story...as proves the case in this series.  I don't usually like films that are ""based on"" - particularly if I have loved the original stories - but I did enjoy this series directed by Michael Landon Jr. If you can accept these aren't the stories of the books written by Christian author Janette Oke, they are an enjoyable set of films of love & faith to watch in their own right. This film is my favourite of the series.

In this film:
Willie & Missie LaHaye arrive on their new land and set to work to start up a home & a ranch. Willie hires some cowboys to help out & Missie becomes friends with her neighbour from the Indian settlement - a blessing to Missie as Miriam is a midwife & promises to be there for Missie when it's her little one's time to enter the world. Missie starts teaching the children in the settlement to read, & also befriends an orphan boy in Tettsford Junction who boards with an elderly lady while his older brother goes out on ""jobs""  to earn money so they can start up their own ranch one day. Oh, & there's a mean trio of bandits who hold up folks...it's only a matter of time before it's the LaHaye's turn.
Missie's quote from Ecclesiates at the end of the film ""To everything there is a season, & a time for every purpose under heaven"" sums up the faithfulness of God in her life throughout all the changing seasons of life.

Only complaint is that they are like 90 Min. episodes of a series simular to the Little House Series. But both my wife and I are fans of L.H. so we enjoyed all five of the series currently out. Note, we caught two of the films on Halmark Station, which will air the sixth sometime this year I think.

Many had not celebrated a Christmas before and responded with the love that was extended to them. It is a movie like those made in earlier years filled with love and compassion for others instead of sex, violence, money, power, and greed.

Well, although it may have some of those aspects; the grunt of this story is imbedded in a young adventurous couple who have strong faith in God, and a lot of guts to make things happen in the wild west.

For the traditional western fan, this movie has it all, covered wagons, indians, bad-guys, shoot-outs, cattle ranches, saloon scenes in town, etc. and so-on.

2431035,5,B000BO0LPO,"I bought this film recently on DVD, and thought it was a good family-friendly film, very inspired!  (I loved the first two as well, ""Love Comes Softly"" and ""Love's Enduring Promise"")  Based on a novel by best-selling Christian fiction write Janette Oke, ""Love's Long Journey,"" is a heart-warming continuation of the story of Missie & William LaHaye (newly married).  This movie is based on the third book in the series.  There is a switch of the actress playing Missie (January Jones is noticeably absent), but newcomer-to-the-series Erin Cottrell does a fine job as Missie (she had me convinced by the end that she WAS Missie); this movie is also not quite accurate to the book, but is so well-told overall, that it stands quite well on its own as a film & continuation of the series.

Missie & Willie LaHaye, newly married, encounter quite a few adventures, both on their journey West & in settling their new homestead!  From Indians (Native Americans) to rustlers & outlaws, they must perservere to establish their new ranch & keep it running.  And to add to the drama, Missie becomes pregnant and is miles from the closest doctor: will this brave couple be able to overcome the obstacles in their way?!?

For those of you worried about content, this is a clean film! There is no language that I can recall; there is some tense situations with Indians & again with some outlaws, but overall it is very family-friendly, and content is not going to be an issue.

This is a wonderful, family-friendly story that promotes good values of love, honor, courage, faith, forgiveness, and much more! Highly recommended as a break from the typical Hollywood fare: this is wholesome family fun!",1153440000,12,1685,4.822916666666667
2431036,4,B000BO0LPO,"This is a family-friendly movie, enjoyable for children as well as adults. While the plot is very unlike the book, the story line is good. I would recommend reading the book series first, then watching the movies in order(Love Comes Softly, Love's Enduring Promise, Love's Long Journey).",1152835200,3,287,5.127659574468085
2431037,5,B000BO0LPO,"This latest screen version of Janette Oke's stories presents a beautiful and believable portrayal of Christian virtue in real life.  A strong sub-theme of racial inclusiveness as what should be part of authentic Christian belief and practice, adds great value to this story.  Our family opted out of network television and cable years ago and have chosen to order quality dvd series.  This movie, along with the previous releases are excellent.  I especially appreciate that the Christian witness is clear but not delivered with sledgehammer blows.  Persons are ""won over"" subtley and embraced with Christ-like grace and love long before they make their own personal discovery of redemptive grace.  Conversion, in these movies, does not follow a predictable ""born again"" model, but clearly people's lives are changed.  A telling line in the movie is when one of the older hands says (and I can only roughly paraphrase), ""If what they believe makes them act like they do, then maybe they deserve a hearing.""

I enthusiastically recommend these movies to anyone.  For me and my house, Love's Long Journey is a delightful and edifying tale.  It well fills the prescription in Philippians 4:8.  ""...whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, ... meditate on these things."" (NKJV)",1152489600,4,1337,5.200934579439252

2431040,5,B000BO0LPO,The book was an excellent story with a moral baseline. The depection of the old west was very accurate in my opinion and the story line was outstanding. I have all three in the series and hope there will be more coming. My daughters and I have all read all the books in the series and truly enjoy each and every one.,1151452800,2,316,4.112903225806452

2431042,5,B000BO0LPO,"Anyone who has lamented the absence of January Jones (for even a second) is quite possibly insane.  The performance delivered by Ms. Cottrell was excellent.  Because it was just THAT: a performance.  January Jones vapidly stood in front of the camera like the proverbial deer in headlights.  I think that if they are to continue making movies from this book series, bringing on Erin Cottrell to lead the cast was an excellent choice. Bravo to Erin and the rest of the cast.",1150070400,5,473,4.7317073170731705
2431043,2,B000BO0LPO,"I miss January Jones. If you read the book you will see why for she brought the Missie I read in the book. What also dissapointed me is the inaccuracy of the movie and the notion that Missie can't COOK. I believe any daughter of Marty could cook very well and since she could make corn bread pudding and fried chicken (In the first two she mentions she can make them) I believe she wouldn't burn biscuts. Erin I believe is a okay actress but I really REALLY perfer January Jones. I hope if they make Love's Abiding Joy that they would use JANUARY JONES.

This movie is okay for renting or buying for it is a okay movie but wouldn't make a good sequal to the Love Comes Softly series.",1148774400,6,683,4.213740458015267
2431044,5,B000BO0LPO,"I thought this movie was great, as well as the first 2 in this series.  I enjoyed seeing ""Willie and Missy"" homestead and the hard times that can come with ""real life.""  They had good times and bad times, just like real families do.  But, they stick together through thick and thin.  They invite others into their home and treat them like family.  It's a great picture of how God ""adopts"" us, His children.  I would definitely recommend renting this movie, if not adding it to your DVD collection.",1147478400,4,497,4.52808988764045
2431045,1,B000BO0LPO,"The first two movies in this series were far better than this one.  The acting is horrible (especially by Erin Cotrell).  I hope she took the money she made from this film and bought some acting classes with it.  Overall, I was really disappointed with this film, considering that the first two were excellent.",1146009600,5,310,4.703703703703703
2431046,5,B000BO0LPO,"Based on Jeanette Oke's ""Love Comes Softly"" series, which has sold over 30 million copies, ""Love's Long Journey"" is the 3rd installment, and is a charming period piece about Missie and Willie LaHaye, going west to start a ranch, build a home, and have a family of their own. This is mellow filmmaking, with a peaceful ambiance, and an occasional dramatic sequence. A Christian theme flows through the plot line, and the film makes excellent family viewing. Those who are used to ""blow 'em up"" fare will find the film slow, others will find it refreshing.

Missy is a gentle woman, and also a natural tomboy, who knows how to shoot a lot better than she can make an edible biscuit, but she learns how to cook from an older cowhand (Frank McRae, endearing as Cookie), and her toughness comes in handy when dealing with some unsavory characters.

Directed by Michael Landon Jr., who also had a hand in the script, the cast is wonderful, with Erin Cottrell as Missy, and Logan Bartholomew as Willie, with John Savage as leader of a trio of bad guys, and Graham Phillips delightful as the young boy Jeff. Irene Bedard is exceptionally beautiful as the LaHaye's Native American neighbor, Miriam. Shot on location in some scenic locations like Big Sky Ranch in Ventura County, California, the cinematography by Brian Shanley is lovely, with endless panoramas and a feeling of how life was in a past era.

""Love's Long Jouney"" is an above average television production, and I'm looking forward to the next film in the series, ""Love's Abiding Joy,"" which is presently in post-production. As Missy quotes from Ecclesiastes in the film, ""For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven,"" and the saga of this family is heartwarming as well as fine entertainment.",1146009600,29,1778,4.803921568627451
2431047,4,B000BO0LPO,"The opening scene in this movie is of a young couple splitting ways with their wagon train and heading off to find the land they will be homesteading. From their calm self assurance, you'd almost think they were on a Sunday drive, but the peaceful atmosphere is broken when the wife, Missy, who is suffering from morning sickness, jumps off the wagon and loses her lunch in the bushes. The first conversation between the couple is stilted, almost as if they had met each other yesterday and weren't sure how to act. But it gets alot better as it goes along, revealing a beautiful interpersonel relationship between two Christian young people beginning a new life in the west together. The dissapiontment was that it could have been ANY couple. There wasn't a whole lot Missy an Willie about their relationship. In Love's Enduring Promise, Willie was blunt and mischivious, as well as sensetive and warm-hearted, while Missy was something of an idealist. January Jones portrayed her as a woman of intense emotion, but reserved and poised, with deep convictions, warm, but not a Teddy Bear, independant and opinionated, and, perhaps most of all, with a gentle dignity. The Missy in Love's Long Journey is a very sweet lady, but not the Missy Davis from Love Comes Softly, and Love's Enduring Promise. She is a cuddly, mellow, tenderhearted benefactress, on the lookout for someone with troubles, and easy to please. Missy Davis always was a hard worker, but now that she's preagnant and in the west, her industrious side is not brought out. After she cuts down the tall grass in her front yard, all she is shown doing is galloping (yes, preagnant!) over to her Indian friend's house to teach the children there how to read, driving into town, writing letters to her parents back home, making conversation with the ranch hands, or serving rock hard biscuits when she has company. Sounds like a modern woman thrown back in time. Throughout the movie, bad guys pop up on the sideline, and when a tipsy ranch hand inadvertantly tells them about Willie's money, trouble starts for the Lehaye family. When tragedy strikes, Missy must summon all her courage to save the day. At the close of the movie is a touching scene of Willie meeting his new son, who Missie names Matthew, after his long lost brother. Heartwarming family movie.",1145664000,2,2324,4.827067669172933
2431048,5,B000BO0LPO,"I absolutely love all three of these films! These movies take us back to a time in our lives when things were still pure and simple and it was the little things that mattered. I whole heartedly encourage you to buy these DVD's and watch them with your kids...it may be the only decent and moral thing they watch on T.V. tonight! If you loved Little House as a kid these movies will welcome you right back to good ol' Walnut Grove! I personally have not read Ms. Oake's books so I can't speak to how the movies compare to the actual storylines, but I can say for certain that even if you haven't read them, you will very much enjoy the movies.

8089829,5,B000BO0LPO,"I haven't read the books that this series is based off of, so my review is simply based off of viewing the movie.  In this movie we have the young couple portrayed by Erin Cottrell and Logan Bartholomew finally finding a place to settle down after two years of struggle.  Although, it turns out, that the Wild West is still wild and they have to fend off gangster thieves.  They had an exciting twist to the story with Marty (Erin Cottrell) tricking one of the would be thieves out of his clothing.  But, I don't want to spoil the plot too much.  The senery in this installment isn't has pretty as in the first two, I guess because they are out West more.  We do have the young couple having their first baby, which is sweet.  And overall, the movie is a clean and wholesome one.",1456444800,,779,4.294520547945205
