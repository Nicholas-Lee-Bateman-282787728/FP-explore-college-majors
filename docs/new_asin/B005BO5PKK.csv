8464102,3,B005BO5PKK,"Yeah, this is what I get for not reading the product description more closely. I haven't been keeping track of recent cartoon shows so I assumed that I'd simply missed catching the new GREEN LANTERN animated series... and that this DVD offers the first five episodes. Nuh-uh. This no-frills DVD, THE BEST OF GREEN LANTERN, contains five episodes culled from various of Warner's DC animated television shows. Obviously, this was produced to cash out on the live action film, as well as the new GL cartoon. Taken individually, the episodes on this DVD border on pretty good to great, except that these are episodes I already have in other DVD collections. I guess if you're some rabid GL fan, this DVD may be your huckleberry. I wish, though, since they were rolling with the GL theme, that this DVD had also squeezed in the ""Hearts and Minds"" episode from JUSTICE LEAGUE, the ""Fallen Hero"" episode from STATIC SHOCK, and ""The Green Loontern"" episode from DUCK DODGERS.

The DVD's five episodes:

- ""In Brightest Day"" (from SUPERMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES) - When a dying Abin Sur crashlands on Earth he sends his ring to seek out a worthy replacement... who turns out to be Kyle Rayner.

- ""In Blackest Night"" Parts 1 & 2 (from JUSTICE LEAGUE) - An extraterrestrial high tribunal deploys the Manhunters to bring John Stewart to trial for his destruction of a planet and its three million sentient inhabitants. The fun starts when the Flash volunteers to defend him in court (""If the ring wasn't lit, you must acquit."").

- ""Ring Toss"" (from THE BATMAN) - Finding himself in a losing battle with Sinestro in Gotham City, a near-unconscious Hal Jordan directs his ring to go and find the Batman. But the ring ends up on the Penguin's chubby finger.

- ""The Eyes of Despero!"" (from BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD) - In the prequel, it's Batman and Dr. Fate versus Wotan. Then Batman and the Green Lantern Corps (including Guy Gardner, Sinestro, and G'nort) team up to face the menace of Despero.

The DVD's only bonus: the trailer for the GREEN LANTERN: RISE OF THE MANHUNTERS video game.",1323820800,18,2082,4.7217630853994494
8464103,1,B005BO5PKK,"First, I must disagree with the review from TIGER...Jon Stewart is the most interesting GL, and has been since his character's introduction. The truth is the GL character has never lived up to its potential. Ever. Jon Stewart has been-and is the best GL- because he brings angst and attitude,not just cockiness. The two episodes in which he stars carry this collection. With the recent release of the Blackest Night series you have a great example of great story telling- with the Sinestro Corp carrying the series. The truth is GL is sub par, and will always be, when compared to DC's big three. My advice: buy teen titans instead; everyone one of those characters are more compelling than the other GLs in this collection.",1323475200,2,724,4.8
8464104,2,B005BO5PKK,"I thought this was new material from the upcoming series or something to do with the movie. But, this is a collection of previous cartoon appearances. Was I decieve into thinking this was new material by the advertisement? Or was I overeager to get the newest DC comics cartoon?",1321833600,2,278,4.6938775510204085
