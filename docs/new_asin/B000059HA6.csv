1405628,3,B000059HA6,"The plot was tired, but the acting was ok especially Ja Rule who seemed a natural to his role. Not a bad first outing Ja.
Pras co-produced and I think he should stick to doing that. His character just seemed too disinterested, or perhaps it was just Pras.
Props to Robert Adetuyi for writing and directing - Jolly good show mah men, but did the editing kill the flow?
Keep up the work guys, hey everyone's a critic...",1018137600,5,417,4.358974358974359
1405629,1,B000059HA6,I gave it a chance and not suprisingly I was thoroughly sickened. This is one of the latest in a crop of Hip Hop crime dramas featuring the same horrible rappers that fuel the ... soundtracks in the acting roles. This movie left a foul taste in my mouth and quite a headache. This is further proof that Rap is ruining all forms of entertainment. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this incorrigible trash.

1405631,4,B000059HA6,"Going into this movie, I expected alot of bs. Especially noting that the two lead characters were rappers; I must give alot of props to Ja Rule, he actually was a pretty good actor! Also, I expected alot of gun fights, with no real plot. However I was pleasantly proved wrong. This movie actually gives us a chance as the audience to get in tune with the characters. In return giving us the ability to be sympythetic towards them, and what they're going through.  The plot is pretty simple, two 20 something black males, trying to get over their 'cash-flow' problem. One, who's love is music, the other just want any method of getting 'set for life.' Throught the movie, we see what obsticles they must cross in order for their dreams to become reality. Even though the start is slow, the tone of this picture slowly developes so that you'll still want to sit through til' the end!",980640000,,881,4.540880503144654

1405659,1,B000059HA6,"Will somebody please get me a glass of water? This movie is about as dry as the Sahara Desert. Pras of the Fugees plays Diamond, a former drug dealer who aspires to be a rapper. Ja Rule plays his best friend ""Gage"", who goes out of his way to help him at the risk of getting beatdown for not paying the people he owes money on time. The simplistic storyline is not the reason why this movie sucks. The ""actors"" are the reason for this film's lousiness. Pras cant act! Repeat: PRAS CANT ACT! Picture a slug crawling in a garden. That's Pras's personality summed up in a nutshell. Ja Rule is not a great actor either but he's better than Pras! Oh yeah, the songs they perform in this movie blows as expected. The little actions scenes in this movie are pathetic and the other actors who star in it such as Tamala Jones, Vondie Curtis-Hall and Jason Statham of ""Crank"" fame don't add much to this movie. Turn it up? How about turning that racket down so I can get some sleep!",1203552000,,972,4.288043478260869
