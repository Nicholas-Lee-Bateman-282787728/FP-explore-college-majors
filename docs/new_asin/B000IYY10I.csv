8147812,2,B000IYY10I,"With Manny Pacquiao stepping in the ring again this coming November, what better way to celebrate the big fighty fight than by watching a Manny Pacquiao movie? Except that LICENSYADONG KAMAO (something like ""Licensed Knuckles""), a 2005 release, doesn't exactly blaze new trails in cinema. Still, it serves to tide his fans over during those in-between lulls when he's not doing what he does best. And what he does best isn't acting, isn't singing, isn't playing hoops, isn't politics.

Whoever wrote the screenplay didn't exactly stretch himself, did he? Stop me if you've heard this before: A talented young boxer seeking to overcome his poverty-stricken background is forced to give up boxing because of a tragedy. Except that redemption lurks from just around the corner and it's not too long before he rises above whatever's dragging him down. He lands a title fight.

Pacman plays Ambrosio ""Bruce"" Lerio, a down and out pugilist supporting his sickly mother and blind little sister by selling balut (which are these nasty duck eggs) and chicharon (pork rinds) on the mean streets of the Philippines. Along the way, he's befriended by three policemen who take an interest in him when they see how well he fights (""Bruce"" occasionally does get to mix it up against various hoods). We learn that Bruce once had a promising boxing career until he accidentally killed his girlfriend's brother in the ring. There went his boxing license. There went his girlfriend. There he is, back to being a street vendor.

But now Bruce is given a second chance, an opportunity to resuscitate his boxing career, and so then the movie tracks his rapid rise up the rankings. But his shot at the world championship is curtailed when his family and girlfriend are abducted by seedy characters who want in on the action. So, to recap, there's the tragic past, the lost love, the lovable blind little sister, and the ""you better play along or we'll kill your loved ones"" plot twist (Hmmm, I wonder if Bruce's cop friends will come in handy at this point?). Yeah, this Pacquiao exploitation flick checks off all the boxes. I'm surprised there isn't a pet dog to kick around here.

This film features what may be the most unresponsive crowd I've ever seen in a Manny Pacquiao fight. The film also shows something which you don't see a lot of from Manny in real life, which is taunt his opponent to promote the boxing event. One note of familiarity is the trademark fiery trunks which Manny often wears. His character wears the same shorts. Manny, in the street brawl scenes, resorts to elbows and kung fu kicks (moves which you definitely can't get away with in the sweet science). Acting-wise, I thought our guy actually does okay and, in fact, seems pretty natural. It doesn't hurt, too, that we get to eyeball two cuties in Aubrey Miles (the girlfriend) and Juliana Palermo (the film's busty femme fatale, Sheena).

LICENSYADONG KAMAO won't give you any definitive clues as to why Manny Pacquiao is so beloved and celebrated in his home country. Making this movie is just one of the perks the man has earned with his real life exploits in the ring. I recommend this film for die-hard Pacquiao fans, but be careful if you decide to get this DVD and you don't speak tagalog. My DVD didn't have English sub-titles.

The ""American"" champion who Manny faces in the title bout is named Rocky Stonewall. That's about as subtle as this story gets. Finally, it's worth mentioning that Manny Pacquiao, as a boxer in motion picture, is absolutely not half as exciting as the Manny Pacquiao you see in actuality, blasting his opponents away with scorching fury and unflagging exuberance. Mad respect to the Pacman. But this movie, it goes down like a balut. Which is fine if you like them nasty duck eggs.",1286409600,,3774,4.798461538461538
