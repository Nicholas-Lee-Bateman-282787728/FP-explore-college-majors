4295526,2,B004A73IY4,"This film combines the grindhouse style with ""Sex and the City"" as it examines the lives of four young girls over a weekend. It starts with Shannon (Ophelia Lovibond) who comes home and discovers her mother is leaving. She desperately needs to talk to her girlfriends who suddenly don't have any time for her. We discover why as the film examines the other girls' lives from their point of view.

Cassandra (Tamsin Egerton ) has left to go to NYC for a piano audition and to lose her virginity to her Skype friend. Things don't go as planned. Kerays (Shanika Warren-Markland) is from Brazil and prefers girls. Joanne (Emma Roberts) is working the night shift at Ted's grocery mart where much of the action happens. Toss in the fact they cross path with some unlikely jewel thieves and you got the bare bones outline.

The film appears to be designed for older teen girls as it combines the more hip grindhouse style, but makes teen girls the heroines of the story. The film blends aspects of comedy, crime drama, action, and thriller but unfortunately does each very sparingly. It is a story in which you can lose interest.

What's it about?
This exciting crime thriller tracks 4 best friends over 3 days they will never forget.  Their lives change forever when a chance encounter with some deadly thieves sends their worlds on a collision course with the players in a major diamond heist.

What did I think?
It was ""Pulp Fiction"" meets ""Mean Girls"" in this edgy British thriller.  You go on a 3 day journey with 4 girls, but you follow one girl at a time.  I liked that it would tell one girl's story, then rewind and tell another's.  All 4 stories tie together in pieces during the movie, then as a whole at the end.  It made for a nice movie where you got the whole story and not just one point of view. I enjoyed it and I hope you will too.",1344297600,,857,4.279503105590062
4295528,1,B004A73IY4,"A film following the lives of four London girl friends; Joanne (Emma Roberts (niece of Julia Roberts)), Shannon (Ophelia Lovibond), Kerrys (Shanika Warren-Markland) and Cassandra (Tamsin Egerton).

All four are more interested in having a good time than being concerned about anyone other than themselves. They are all hard to like characters.

What is interesting is the film breaks into four intertwining stories, each following one of the girls, and how they occasionally re-interact with one of the other leading characters.

It starts with them all going to their respective homes to find something happened. With Shannon, it's to discover her mum is leaving home for a younger man, but she's explained everything in a note that ends up being in Cassandra's bag. The passage of the note back to Shannon forms a smaller interweaving thread.

Kerrys is a anti-man lesbian. Cassandra is looking to go to New York to both audition for a piano part and to meet someone in the flesh who she has only known over the inter-net. Joanne has to work extra shifts now that her dad has lost his job due to an accident.

Further complicated is another thread interlocking the four stories; that of a diamond heist. The diamonds are hidden in a Pringles packet and Pringles appears throughout the film.

Unfortunately none of the main characters are likable. The story thread involving the diamonds is also highly contrived.

What is interesting is the odd assortment of other people in minor roles:
Kevin Smith as Big Larry, rapper Eve as Latisha, Mandy Patinkin as Jago Larofsky, (Star Trek:Deep Space Nine's) Alexander Siddig as Mr. Jauo-Pinto, Sean Pertwee as Mr. Richards.",1310601600,,1667,5.018115942028985

4295533,4,B004A73IY4,"4.3.2.1 is a hard to follow film because it often makes no sense (especially in the beginning) so it's somewhat of a minor miracle that I enjoy it enough to give 4 stars.  Hey maybe that's what the movie title means!  It's impossible to give it a 5 so our choices are 1 through 4, haha.

This movie is definitely for teens because the writing involving sexual stuff is really immature in a way that makes adults blush.  It's also extremely hard to follow because the story often switches into several different directions at the blink of an eye, while making it difficult for the viewer to keep up.  This is due to the camera jerking around like mad *all the time*.  Good luck keeping up with the events on screen and trying to make sense of anything!  What I can make out strikes me as a bunch of teenage drama involving young ladies however, but it *does* begin to make sense when the focus is on each of the ladies lives.

Ophelia Lovibond is depressed and suicidal with her own family matters (her depressed dad blames her for their mother leaving I think, and on one occasion shows violent outbursts).  She's the one in possession of the diamonds and frequently finds herself roaming around town to be with her friends, but she always appears during the wrong times while conflicts are occurring with the other girls, so we end up feeling sorry for her that nobody's giving her any much-needed attention (and trust me the way Ophelia looks and acts with her pale face and quiet demeanor, she *needs* urgent attention!)

Tamsin Egerton who is absolutely gorgeous (quite possibly the hottest girl I've ever seen in fact- yes I'd go THAT far!  Just look at her amazing elegant hairstyle, beautiful blonde hair, perfect eyes and stunning face!).  She has her own issues trying to lose her virginity while dealing with punk kids who are secretly teaming together with one of them using her for sex and the other a private computer nerd who obsesses over Tamsin with her picture of her scattered all over his room.  Funny when Tamsin discovers this and the way she responds, LOL!  All kinds of you-know-what breaks loose!  It is hard to believe someone as beautiful as her would be a virgin though.

Shanika-Warren Markland is the one who is well, very frisky let's just say!  And this friskiness is in relation to other girls she meets at clubs and often brings home to sleep with despite her gloomy stepfather disapproving.  He's actually a nice guy wanting the best for his stepdaughter but Shanika can't shake away from trouble and late night partying/excitement.  She's quite the opposite from her stepdad.  While at nightclubs and partying, she often gets into disputes with other guys and usually outsmarts them and can handle herself quite well when it comes to self-defense.  Later Shanika and her girlfriend get stuck in an underground panic room.  This is all really silly!  However not silly enough to lose me completely.  Well the first 20 minutes of film are *really* confusing, but the rest of it is just crazy in a more focused kind of way.

And then we arrive to the final girl of the group- Emma Roberts, who works at a downtown convenience store with her sister, however her sister always has relationship issues and needs Emma to fill in.  Emma has to work hard to support her entire family.  Anyway Emma's boss (Noel Clarke) is a total demanding jerk who dislikes whenever Emma takes out her cellphone and talks, when she should be stacking items on shelves.  It turns out there's a scheme going on involving Noel and others, that eventually turns violent later on with the introduction of other characters and a pretty good cliffhanger of an ending.  Too bad the actual diamond aspect feels like it's wasted so a group of teen girls can go around town on their own adventures, however in the movies defense a lot of this writing is fairly clever the way it ties the lives of each girl together.

Overall, 4.3.2.1 is a drama for teenagers.  The storyline is supposed to be about four teen girls in possession of diamonds and the story behind how they got ahold of the diamonds and what they should do with them, and while the story is very creative once it gets going 20 minutes in and the girls find themselves involved with their own side stories, there's all kinds of confusion concerning the direction of the story in the beginning- vital writing at that.  For what it is however, it's pretty good.  You just have to wait 20 minutes for the story to get going because the actual diamond stuff is tacky and insufficient.",1446854400,,4543,4.645807259073842

I LOVED the girls, these gals can take care of themselves and don't take crap from anyone (well, almost) ... and the script, written by the film's co-director Noel Clarke (who also plays Tee in the film), is very clever in playing out each girl's individual story, while tying up every loose end in how their stories all play off against each other, as well.

4295548,3,B004A73IY4,"Four young women with diverse social, economic and lifestyle backgrounds still manage a girl bonding familiarity with each other which they will need as future events unfold. Soon after a social get-together and as they are about to part ways they get, unknowingly, caught up in a street diamond heist. The camera follows each girl for a few days; with each telling their individual stories. Eventually they all come together to sort out their personal issues as well as the unexpected addition of the diamond heist.

Problems come with some of the acting or role portrayals as either being too superficial, or in opposition, at times too over-the-top unbelievable. Almost cartoonish, stereotypic portrayals.
Storyline flow problems show up with the time consuming, redundant, flashbacks. Relatedly, cinematography was too disjointed - at times a nauseating hand held viewpoint and at other times, scenes were too brief to follow; and at times bad camera angles gave an artificial, made up, feel to the story. Add strange editing and it becomes even more visually disruptive. In summary, not a viewer comfortable flow to the movie.
The script had it's creative moments, but overall was a bit too stereotypic with the usual bad guy, bad girl roles contrasted with our get tough heroine girls. One of the main selling points was suppose to be females standing up for themselves. But, tough girls have been around for decades, e.g. ""Lara Croft"" - Jolie to ""KickAss"" - Moretz to ""The Girl ..."" - Rapace and if we add Thurman, Beckinsale, Jovovich, the standard has been set. Anything less seems like a weak copy.",1347321600,,1608,5.022471910112359

8419560,4,B004A73IY4,"4.3.2.1 or as we're told in the opening credits 4 Girls, 3 days, 2 cities, 1 chance, is a film you've probably never heard of (the title probably didn't help it when it came out), It's a dark film about friendship of four British girls at least three from rather affluent households.  These girls don't take lip or bad behaviour from males at all. The film starts with the financially poor girl on the fence of a bridge looking like she's about to jump with a hand full of  diamonds, the other three rushing from their car telling her to stop.  Most of the film is a flashback to this point, beginning  when a handbag thief gets his brutal comeuppance when he tries to run off with one of there bags at a cafe. It didn't entirely make sense that the police were called since the girls left straight after thereby leaving no one to press charges, but it showed the audience these girls can take care of themselves.  Something some diamond thieves will find out when they cross paths with these girls throughout the movie.  After the handbag thief beating the four girls go home separately, and we one at a time follow each of their stories that of course cross over each other over the next three days.  Initially we follow the girl we saw on the bridge, who walks in on her parents arguing as her mother is leaving.  Her mother doesn't want to talk to her, rudely telling her she wrote her note and put it in her bag.  It's no longer there after the attempted theft.  She assumes one of her friends must have it and tries to contact them or visit them.  Each has no time for her or tells her to get lost.  She grows more and more depressed, and is attacked by muggers, chased by police and gets more and more depressed.  But as we start to see things from the other girls stories we start to realise nothing is as it seemed outside of the mind of the initial girl.

The other three girls are a wealthy girl flying to New York (movie is set in the UK), to audition for a music school who also plans on meeting up with a guy she's met online to lose her virginity to.  A dark skinned girl whose biological dad isn't on the scene and doesn't respect the guy who raised her.  She doesn't like her brother (and viewers probably won't either), and she's very violent towards men who do the wrong thing.  Emma Roberts' character (the only one of the main three most viewers will likely recognise), has some weird set up where her parents own a convenience store, but her dad injured his leg doing something else, so her mother expects her or her sister to go in and do late shifts instead of her.  The sister has just met a guy and wants to go on dates.  This character's story was the most fun, although it made the least amount of sense.  I'm assuming her parents owned the store or it just made no sense at all otherwise.

4.3.2.1 was a pretty fun film.  It's not an anti male film, it just has all its main characters being female. There's some obvious product placements such as Pringles, but most movies do that these days. The end scenes leave it open for a sequel, I'd check that out if it was made.",1481673600,,3100,4.299483648881239
