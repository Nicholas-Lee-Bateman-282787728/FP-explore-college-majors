The movies themselves are classics, campy and nostalgicgreat for a saturday morning with a friend. The extras are so-so, but pretty standard for collections of rubber-suit films from this era. Overall, I love this collection, and I watch it all the time!",1354752000,2,362,4.950819672131147
8274088,5,B0019H6IWC,"This dvd is great, you get all the three films in a normal dvd cover, the artwork on the dvd looks great and the picture quality looks good.
These movies have more imaginative and interesting creatures than any fantasy movie from hollywood. Fantasy movies from the west often have creatures that looks just lame or ugly. Yokai monsters is what i hoped pans labyrint would be(that movie had only two creatures and it was only the one with eyes in his hands that looked intersting). There are hundreds of creatures in japanese mythology so you don't get to see all of them. Spook warfare is the first and best of the trilogy, one hundred monsters is less good than the first and along with ghosts is the last and worst of the trilogy, but all of the films is worth a watch.
The movies are very unique and weird, if you like these movies you should check out the great yokai war and sakuya:the slayer of demons.",1339632000,4,908,4.4431137724550895
8274089,3,B0019H6IWC,"This set of three videos sits in that strange land between adult and child. To the american audience, two of the best-known neighbors in that land would be the original versions of the stories collected by the Brothers Grimm and Struwelpeter (Shock-Head Peter). These are stories from a time when even the children of the upper middle-class were much less insulated from the violence of the world than are many american and japanese children. At the same time, these Yokai tales are squarely centered on the idea that justice will prevail and innocence is, sometimes, worthy of protection even by monsters.

Yokai are supernatural japanese beings that run the range from fully corporeal monster to ghosts. In these movies it is men (or, in one case, an ancient assyrian foreign monster) that cause problems and the yokai who battle the forces of evil, especially to protect children. They are are crudely animated and bizarre monsters (not unlike the screen versions of the Addams Family) but are effective in portraying their playfulness and protectiveness. I believe that many children will find them frightening at first then strangely comforting with later viewings. In a world where most children's cartoons and movies have been trimmed to the point that there is little or no tension to sustain children's interest beyond following colorful forms across a screen, these yokai movies may be a crude but effective antidote.",1320105600,2,1427,5.124463519313305
