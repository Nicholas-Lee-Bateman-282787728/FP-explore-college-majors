8689641,5,B00PX7SWRI,A strange story about a woman who latches on to a demonic husband in order to bail out of her life as a singer nin a nite club in the Tropics. Excellent Carole Lombard as always and Charles Laughton..mesmerizing.,1484524800,,212,4.461538461538462
8689642,5,B00PX7SWRI,"What a movie! Way over the top and much better than I had expected. Charles Laughton completely dominates this Paramount film which looks a lot like the more famous ""Island Of Lost Souls"" from the same period. This was so good I watched it two nights in a row. Laughton is as vicious as they come in this film; he seems even more so after starting to earn some sympathy from the viewer before he lures Carole Lombard to his own private ""Heart of Darkness"" upriver. Read the other reviews for the plot, but if you like ""Island of Lost Souls"", you'll like this one as well (and it's a beautiful print).",1445212800,5,600,4.366071428571429
8689643,5,B00PX7SWRI,"Yes it was a good movie,and seeing Charles Laughton,as he started out in his familiar roles as the ""heavy""...was great...And Carole Lombard always gives a great performance..Charles Bickford,was a great favorite of mine........",1431993600,3,227,5.909090909090909
8689644,5,B00PX7SWRI,Great movie. I watch it all of the time.,1427760000,,40,3.5555555555555554
8689645,3,B00PX7SWRI,Great movie but disc a purple copy not slated to last long.,1423180800,,59,4.0
8689646,4,B00PX7SWRI,"Paramount' answer to Red Dust is almost as fun.  Carole Lombard, looking bored throughout the whole movie in a role better suited for Dietrich, marries Charles Laughton, who is way over the top.  She has all the men in at the jungle plantation lusting after her, which just seems to bore her even more.  The men are all unshaven, sweaty & dirty, while Lombard is perfectly groomed & doesn't even break a sweat.  To say anything of the plot would be unfair.  Must be seen to be believed!  A fun pre-code film.",1422057600,4,508,4.467391304347826
8689647,5,B00PX7SWRI,"Classic pre-code lunacy with a great cast. Carole Lombard young and alluring but not salacious.
Laughton as an evil, disgusting, blackmailing, rubber plantation owner in Malaysia.
Charles Bickford as a sexually aggressive newly hired hand. The most morbid scene shows
Bickford with a deadly blow dart in his neck sitting at a poker table (with Laughton) with his
eyes rolled back in his head.",1420070400,13,392,5.140625
8689648,5,B00PX7SWRI,"This is a prime example of pre-code cinema. Murder, suicide, love triangles, and gruesome death scenes.

Carole Lombard is a singer who's reputation is ruined when her husband commits suicide. Fired from her job, she's offered a marriage proposal by a creepy land owner played by Charles Laughton. Once they're hitched, he takes her to his boat on a river far away from civilized society.

If you love pre-code cinema, pick this up. You won't regret it.",1416873600,35,453,4.87012987012987
