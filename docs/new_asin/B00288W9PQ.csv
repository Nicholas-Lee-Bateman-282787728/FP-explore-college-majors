3872165,3,B00288W9PQ,"Like many other people, I have been watching GREER CHILDERS' commercials on TV for years.  You do have to hand it to this Lady -- she HAS managed to stay young looking for a long, long time.  Along with diet author OLEDA, and model CARMEN, Ms. Childers seems to have found a way to make the years pass much, much more slowly on her face and body.

In the commercial for SHAPELY SECRETS 7 - 7 MINUTE WORKOUT, women go from on-screen to an off-screen ""mystery room"", where they perform the routines to help them lose weight.  NONE of these routines or excercises is every shown, (even for one second).  The ladies just come out of the ""secret room"", and praise the excercises.

After watching this commercial for about 20 years or so, and remaining intrigued, I finally bought the excercise video, (Volume One, of two volumes), and put it on my DVD player. )I didn't have a video player for 15 of those 20 years, so I guess that may have had somethng to do with my waiting so long to buy it!)  Well, the room in which these excersises take place ls lovely, and Ms. Childers is a pretty good teacher, not doing the excercises too fast, or too slow, and one could probably do them, after watching several times.  However, SOME of these excercises are definitely NOT for people with even
a small amount of limited mobility.  This is NOT mentioned on the TV commercial, and NOT mentioned on the DVD cover.

Further, on her website, Ms. Childers recommends E__ B__, a vitamin with green tea.  I bought this vitamin from her website, and yes, it did help me to lose weight.  However, since I bought it from her website, I concluded, (logically?) that Ms. Childers had formulated this vitamin herself, and that it was made by her own company.  (Well, it STILL seems a logical assumption to me).  But when I got the small bottle, I noticed it was made by a completely different company!  Searching for this vitamin supplement on Amazon, and elsewhere, I FOUND I COULD GET TWICE AS MUCH IN A LARGER BOTTLE, FOR THE SAME PRICE!

I can understand Ms. Childers and her organization wanting to make a small profit on these vitamins -- but FIFTY PERCENT??????

Since the vitamins, filled as they are with GREEN TEA, do work, I am sure the excercises work, as well.  Only I can't do many of them, myself.  And I'm sure there are others who can do even less of them.  It would have been nice if the fact that many of the exercises may be difficutlt for those with limited mobility was mentioned in the commerical, and also on the DVD.  And SUPER-NICE if Ms. Childers and her organization had taken somewhat less of a profit on the vitamins with green tea in them, which, however, DO work -- at least for me.  So, (to paraphrase Charles Dickens), this is NOT the worst of all workouts and vitamin supplements, but then, neither is it the best of all workouts and vitamin supplements.",1281571200,11,2864,4.488416988416988

8355960,5,B00288W9PQ,"I had started BodyFlex in the 90's but raising children and working outside the home I allowed myself to get distracted.
 I am now in my early 60's and am a Nanna to 3 grandbabies and a homemaker.  From my neck to my calves I have about 53 inches I would like to loose between doing BodyFlex and Callanetics .  Both of these programs are excellent exercise for the body with no stress on joints etc.  With both of these exercise programs you stretch and elongate all areas of your body and improve your posture, strength muscles, burn fat and increase your oxygen intake through BodyFlex with keeps the whole body healthier. I am on a Self-Improvement Journey

I thank God for these two women who dared to research and gain knowledge about the human bodyand searched out answers to overcame their health issues.
These two women dared to think outside the box and through their unique ways of improving their body they then shared with us and made it possible financially for us do improve ourselves as well getting the same results that Callan Pinchney and Greer Childers did.  Their bodies are true examples that their exercise works!!!!

Remember this:  The KEY to success IS CONSISTANCY AND PERSISTANCE.  I am doing these two workouts for my body as part of my life-style until the Lord takes me home.  I want to be at my best for God, myself and my family.  Life is good!  I am feeling a difference already doing Callanetics and BodyFlex.

I cook healthy and I am not ""dieting"".  I enjoy the occassional dessert on the weekends only and avoided processed food.  Yes there is some effort in cooking however make it a family activity like you do playing a game or going for a bike ride.  Eating is a time for family to get together from preping food, to cooking it, eating  and the clean up... get the whole family involved because Eating is a Family-Affair. Make your kitchen attractive by just having it neat, clean and organized so that you enjoy too.
  May God Bless Your Self-Improvement Journey!",1369180800,9,2003,4.607344632768362
8355961,5,B00288W9PQ,"After years of use, I needed to replace my original DVD of Shapely Secrets as it had worn out.  Greer Childers' exercises meld well with those my physical therapist has given me.  Her advice to start slowly and only do what one is able to do must be stressed.  The exercises seem easy, but the body knows better, so follow her advice.  Isometric exercises may appear to be like you are doing nothing in 7 minutes; however, each day I saw and felt progress.  After a couple months I was getting complements on my posture, my shape, and facial tone and I felt good with more strength.  Her exercises helped me to move on to more strenuous kinds of exercise. I would recommend the program to anyone who can stand and is just starting to exercise; however, do heed Greer's advice.",1362614400,9,776,4.468085106382978
8355962,1,B00288W9PQ,This video was not worth the price. It was only about 10 minutes long and had little information. The price should have been a lot lower for this product.,1302652800,7,154,4.344827586206897
