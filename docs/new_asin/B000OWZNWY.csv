2801576,4,B000OWZNWY,"I was impressed with Jim Grover's Combatives series. He covers the basic techniques in combatives in a clear, easy manner. Even if you have no martial arts experiance you can learn effective techniques from this set.",1358294400,2,216,5.027777777777778
2801577,3,B000OWZNWY,"Fast shipment.  Well packaged.  I bought this based on the ""Building Your Library"" article in Shooting Times magazine.  Nothing wrong with it.  The material is practical and very well presented.  But I'm a smaller and older guy - most of the techniques would not really work for me.",1357689600,2,282,4.791666666666667
2801578,5,B000OWZNWY,"I just got the Jim Grover Combatives DVD Series 1-3 and I think this is some very top notch combatives.
The no nonsense approach, the practicality of the techniques and the simplicity of movement...coupled with the easy explanations by Kelly, makes these DVDs a must have to anyone's library on self defense and combatives.

I train in jujutsu and Krav Maga.  I enjoy them both and they provide a great foundation.  After seeing the Jim Grover DVD's,  I saw techniques and certain applications that made me think ""Wow. That was very cool!""  But most of all, it was simple, which it what you will need when SHTF.  After training in these combatives for some time, I would think it would be very hard to train in any thing else.  Just being honest.  The weapons work looks interesting.  I am more familiar with Krav Maga weapons work, but I look forward to experimenting with Kelly's approach.  I would also add that the mindset is around self defense, not sport combat or traditional martial arts.  That is the paradigm you are working in and the DVD's achieve that objective nicely.

If you are a person that is just looking for some basic combatives that are easy to learn and apply, these are a great start.  If you are experienced, I still think these DVD's are a great supplement to any martial art/self defense system.",1346284800,3,1323,4.650862068965517
2801579,5,B000OWZNWY,"I ordered this DVD, after watching his collapsible baton training DVD, this DVD finds a much younger Jim Grover, but you can see where he developed his system.  His techniques are simple, direct and effective.  He has a core system that he builds on, and relates to other weapons systems, and defense, they're integral.  I like this guy's approach, on the attack, multiple stikes, targetted body parts, sensible below the belt kicks, groin, knee, shin and ankle, no off balance high kicks or spinning on your arse kicks, just take him out and keep him down. No fancy dancing, no death touch B.S. or mystical intrigue, just fast effective techniques.",1331856000,,649,4.881818181818182
2801580,5,B000OWZNWY,McCann is an excellent instructor.  His training philosophy is perfect for people who want to learn how to survive a violent encounter.  This set is absolutely packed with material and is a tremendous value for the student of combatives.,1326844800,,237,5.051282051282051
2801581,5,B000OWZNWY,"This is a great DVD set worth every cent.

Kelly McCann/Jim Grover is not just the ""real deal"" as is often said, but a smart, well spoken and skilled instructor/teacher.

I purchased this set along with ""Ultimate Krav Maga.""  I watched this first, and in doing so I think it made the ""UKM"" set look even worse than it is.

As a result of this DVD series I will be buying more of the McCann/Grover series.

This is a VERY GOOD training aid.",1310169600,6,439,4.240963855421687
2801582,5,B000OWZNWY,"I've been a martial artist for 9 years.  I'm a brown belt in jiu-jitsu and have trained in boxing and kickboxing.

This is the best material I've ever seen for using open handed striking.  If push came to shove and I needed something to save my skin quick, this is the stuff I'd use first despite all my more ""technical"" martial arts experience.

The high points are the open handed striking instruction and the excellent weapons instruction (by far the most realistic, practical weapons defense instruction I've come across).

The low point of the DVD's is the ground fighting instruction, which I found a bit TOO simplistic.  As I said, I'm a jiu-jitsu brown belt, so it is hard for me to bracket that experience, though; it might be great ground instruction for someone with no ground experience.

Besids the techniques, Grover is certain to explain principles and give drills.  This is an awesome DVD.",1267056000,19,905,4.7935483870967746
2801583,5,B000OWZNWY,"As a life time student of the martial arts and reality based combatives, I found this three-set series of combatives by Jim Grover(Alias Kelly McCain)to be the very best on the market today.  This series has some of the most practical and highly effective self-defense techniques for the real world.  The first video covers how to deliver powerful strikes and kicks.  Grover demonstrates how to create enough power to effectively take down an attacker.  I have practiced his striking methods and found them to be efficient and simple to master.  The second video deals with ground fighting and countering club/stick attacks.  With the popularity of ground fighting these days the counter techniques demonstrated in this video are practical and reality based.  The final video in this series covers weapon disarming techniques.  There is nothing fancy, complicated or difficult in all the techniques taught in this series. It is important to note, that this is not a series of videos on formal martial arts.  However,  if you are seeking a realistic and highly effective reality based street combat lessons, you will want to purchase Jim Grover's Combative Series. This series is the absolute best practical combat techniques on the market.

 Rating:  5 stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Pro-Systems Combatives Vol. 1,2)",1247270400,10,1322,5.228571428571429
2801584,5,B000OWZNWY,"Kelly McCann has the kind of credentials that the vast majority of reality based trainers, instructors and charlatans pretend they have, wish they had or hope they could get.

Mr. McCann IS the REAL deal, unlike so many self-profess they are.  He possesses both experience and training histories within the Marine Corps as a Major, and a High Risk Operator/Trainer within the Private sector.

The video selections cover everything it promotes that it does--simply, effectively, concisely and realistically.  No BS present any where within the DVDS that I could smell.  The Material convey the essential
hard-hitting, brutal truths of violence management 101.  And this is something Mr. McCann always stressed: that all advance applicatons are merely the basics executed with the highest levels of proficiency.  There are no such things as advanced survival skills in violence--only situationally correct actions, with which this video presentation abounds.

When our awarness faulters and our judgments slip from avoidance, when the event turns horrifically bad, resorting to physical mayhem, one really does need to have proficiently mastered all of the materials presented in this DVD selection, if one really wants at least a fighting chance for survival.

Hands down, Kelly McCann's materials are top of the line!!

2801585,5,B000OWZNWY,"These DVDs {Videos} on Jim Grover's Combatives are BY FAR some of the best instructional self-offense videos you can get.  PERIOD!!!  Of course you'll have to put in some hard work and training but really not much.  This is Hard-Core in your face stuff.  I KNOW YOU MAY COME ACROSS A LOT OF ADDS OUT THERE SAYING SOME OF THE SAME STUFF ABOUT OTHER VIDEOS THAT I'M SAYING HERE -- BUT TRUST ME I'VE SEEN MOST OF THEM OUT THERE.  AND THEY ALL FALL SHORT.  I consider this one of my holy grails of fighting.  For real.  I am not a big guy but I do feel confident in my skill to defense myself thanks to what I've learned here.

  Jim Grover is a Amazing man and teach.  And even though these will teach a great deal I MUST recommend getting his Self-Offense video as well.  In fact I think I would put that one head of this if you've already had some good training in combative arts.  Self-Offense offers a chance to see Jim beating on a few bigger guys hard and fast PLUS some cool techniques to us if you are going against a Bigger, Stronger, MORE SKILLED FIGHTER.

  KELLY MCCANN {AKA JIM GROVER} IS THE BEST!",1175817600,8,1108,4.22488038277512

8187045,5,B000OWZNWY,"Another top notch product from someone who does not subscribe to , ""this SHOULD work.."" that most martial arts fall into.  His stuff hurts to receive, as it should be.  When you're tired of the 2 year Black Belt plan that many schools unfortunately subscribe to, (how can any school guarantee you are black belt level within that two years?!  Oh yeah, that's right, you PAID to be ready....how about earning that right by working hard for 6 or 7 years?), then you'll appreciate McCann's material.  Many of McCann's students burn their prior black belts after training with him.

These techniques will be considered too simplistic for many who believe a MASTER is someone who has the most stripes on their obi, (belt).  A real 'master' is someone who has been in harm's way and then tells you how it feels to be punched, even shot or stabbed so that others do not have to suffer that by training realistically.  Excellent material Kelly!",1440547200,,936,4.705521472392638
8187046,5,B000OWZNWY,"This set of DVDs are pretty good compared to other ones from my collection. It does provide an easy simple approach to combative. You can study, analyze and practice these techniques presented by McCann. You don't have to follow it to the T, but use it to enhance or support the method of close combat you are currently practicing. One clear message is inflicting pain. That supports my current training approach. It's all about surviving.",1437782400,,439,4.866666666666666

8187048,5,B000OWZNWY,"Jim Grover's (aka Kelly McCann's) Combatives Series of videos is a foundational set of DVDs for those in high-risk situations, people who travel and those to who don't wish to be unprepared when bad things happen to good people.  Kelly takes a welcomed approach, rather than learning a set of techniques that are applied one after the other he teaches effective techniques that can be mastered and the approach of cycling (i.e. one combative technique followed by whatever other you is most appropriate) rather than a, followed by b, followed by c.  In the real world, the aggressor(s) won't wait while you try to follow a script you've memorized.  Combative you learn an approach and if it isn't working go to another instinctively. I highly recommend it!  Hats off to Kelly McCann!",1436140800,,783,4.909090909090909
8187049,5,B000OWZNWY,"This is raw self defense. No holds barred. No nonsense. No Hollywood. I like Grover's straight-to-the-point approach. Keep in mind his techniques are about surviving and escaping an attack. Whether or not you carry a firearm for defense, you need to know how to defend with your bare hands.",1427846400,,290,4.938775510204081

8187051,5,B000OWZNWY,"...foundational video training set for beginning combatives training available.  I purchased this (on VHS) about 14 years ago and have since purchased everything McCann's produced.  He's the Bruce Lee of combatives! If you're interested in the subject, I urge you to avail yourself the benefit of this video instruction.  IMHO, it's the best place to start.",1365724800,,357,5.339285714285714

8187053,4,B000OWZNWY,"I feel like I've been giving too many four stars lately but with this product I would be amiss to do any less.  McCann(Grover) now has a wide vareity of material one can choose from to increase their preparedness level.  His newer ""Kembatives"" series is probably the best overall, but you're going to be paying hundreds of dollars when all is said in done if you choose to collect them all.  I call this little set the best bargain for the guy on a budget.  NOT as a good a deal as it was a few years ago when I bought them.  I'm a little shocked to see the increase in cost.  It still is a good choice.  He covers all the basic concepts except for knife fighting and firearms which if I'm not mistaken there are also ""Grover"" versions of those as well as in the Kembatives.",1365552000,2,774,4.1891891891891895
