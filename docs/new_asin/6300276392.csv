7809316,3,6300276392,"I purchased it - hoping it was like a Donald Duck documentary - I had it transferred on to DVD-R.
I Love Classic Disney. This is just like 3-4 Donald Duck short cartoons. Some with Goofy.
Nothing about the making of Donald - or Carl Barks - or any of that stuff.
I love the coloring, artistry and animation.
Can tell it's older - with the smoking and violence etc (I mean compared to present day)",1386633600,,396,4.223684210526316
