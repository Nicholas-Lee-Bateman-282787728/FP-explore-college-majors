2385052,4,B000ACPALW,"Having retired from the Womans Army Corps after 25 years of service
I really enjoyed this film. I took my Basic training at Ft. Lee,VA.
and even saw several friends from those days as extras in the film. Rosalind Russell was perfect for the part and the supporting cast, especally Marie Wilson,were all excellent. Things have changed quite a lot in the army for women since this film was made
but you will still find yourself laughing at the trials & tribulations of Roz Russell as she goes through training  and must finally make the decision that will change her life. Give it a look and enjoy.",1251504000,5,596,4.570093457943925
2385053,4,B000ACPALW,Love the character Rosalind Russell portrays in this great old black and white classic film. Wish there were more like this one!,1219449600,7,128,4.863636363636363
2385054,3,B000ACPALW,"""Never Wave at a WAC"" is a must for anyone who has ever served in the Women's Army Corps.  Many of the women stationed at Ft. Lee when the film was made were extras in the movie; some had speaking roles.  Many WAC Bandsmen were in the movie, which made it very nostalgic for me.  The quality of the DVD left much to be desired; some of the VHS tapes are of better quality.",1218931200,5,372,4.0
2385055,3,B000ACPALW,"If you love Roz then you will love this movie, Roz is a spoilt society dame who joins the WAC (sound like Private Benjamin?)The first part sees her very much as the Auntie Mame/Sylvia Fowler socialite, as she progreses we see her humble to enjoy her position as a mortal private. Loads of fun, print looks like it's come straight of a VCR but still worth every cent if you love this talented funny lady.",1209254400,7,403,4.386666666666667
2385056,4,B000ACPALW,"This 1952 movie was made in cooperation with the Department of Defense, Department of the Army, Women's Army Corps at Fort Lee, VA and had a cameo appearance by (then) General of the Army Omar Bradley.

Divorced socialite learned her new boyfriend was going overseas. Her father talked her into joining the WAC so she can go with him. She joined thinking she was going to become an officer.

Scenes included real WACs at Fort Lee marching to briefings, in classes, parades, being issued clothing and getting their shots, as was the 14th WAC band.

When her ex-husband, working for the Quartermaster Corps creating and testing new uniforms and equipment, spots his ex-wife in uniform he requests that she be assigned to his project. One scene the women were dressed in arctic uniforms and placed in a controlled environment with -20 degrees and wind like a blizzard. Another day they were testing wet weather outfits.

This romantic comedy brought back many memories and chuckles of my own Basic Training and my time spent at Fort Lee. While this movie may not have been Rosalind Russell's best work it certainly showed a bit of Army life that the WACs endured.",1207526400,13,1160,4.814070351758794
2385057,3,B000ACPALW,"This comparatively little known film, with the extremely unlikely storyline is, nevertheless a joy to watch. It is pure escapism with more than a hint of nostalgia for those of us of a certain age. The script is good with some nice one-liners, but because the plot itself is obviously rather weak things become a little laboured. I doubt it would come over as successfully as it does, where it not for the one and only Rosalind Russell - ever able to combine excellent dramatic and comedic acting with the epitome of Hollywood glamour. And where oh where would it have been without that stalwart, always believable, and I think much underrated actor, Paul Douglas as Russell's long suffering ex husband.

If you feel like some light hearted 1950s entertainment you could do a lot worse.",1178928000,5,786,4.779411764705882

2385064,5,B000ACPALW,This is Rosalind Russell's show and she is absolutely wonderful.  Whoever made Private Benjamin with Goldie Hawn in 1980 MUST have seen this movie because the similarities are too many to be accidental.  Hawn was wonderful in Private Benjamin but nobody compares to the great Rosalind Russell.  She was a national treasure.,1425081600,2,323,5.173076923076923
2385065,2,B000ACPALW,"Rosalind Russel is the only good thing about this. She comes pretty close to doing an I love lucy shtick...frequently. Message is pro America, pro army. Ex husband is older teddy bear of a man,it's all alot of a far fetched bit of fluff",1421798400,,236,4.386363636363637

2385073,5,B000ACPALW,I am not a big fan of Rosalind Russell but from time to time she surprises me. She was quite funny in her early films. She was that in this film. I would watch it again.,1394409600,,169,3.7222222222222223
2385074,2,B000ACPALW,One of the worst Russel films I have ever seen. The ending made no sense. Who joins the Army to go to Paris?,1393545600,,108,3.739130434782609

2385076,4,B000ACPALW,"The transfer is middling to poor quality, there's a pesky RE logo present throughout that's annoying.
This film is mainly for Rosalind Russell fans (it's the only reason I bought it).  The comedy is all over the place.  The story involves an overage spoiled rich `girl' (Russell), who wants her father (a senator) to get her a commission as an officer in the army so she can fly to Paris on the government's dime to be with her boyfriend Lt. Col. Schuyler (Sky) Fairchild.  She's not picky; she could easily see herself as a general.  Her father though, tricks her into joining the army as a private.  During basic training, she meets up with her ex-husband (Paul Douglas).  The result is pretty predictable.  And although Russell can toss barbs like no one else, she's easily undone by scene stealer Marie Wilson as Clara Schneiderman, alias Danger O'Dowd (a model......of sorts).  Favorite scene has Russell going through the physical exam, smoking, while being told to inhale and exhale.
This is a cute film, hardly a classic.  But I enjoyed watching it and don't mind adding it to my collection.",1388620800,2,1099,4.803191489361702
2385077,3,B000ACPALW,"Was this a recruitingfilm for early WACs?  Too predictable characters,  The interferring ex husband needed to be worked over with an e-tool.",1387065600,,140,5.318181818181818
2385078,4,B000ACPALW,"It's cute, but not the best Rosalind Russell movie ever made.  I'm glad I have it, but would not buy it if I had seen it before.  Made in 1953, black and white, includes Paul Douglas and Marie Wilson.  Rosalind, a rich divorcee, joins the army to be closer to her boyfriend.  She is not prepared for the lack of partial treatment and finds army life really difficult.  Her ex-husband is an army consultant and uses his position to make life harder for her.  It is funny.",1383609600,,470,4.344827586206897
2385079,3,B000ACPALW,"A stuck-up and self-centered socialite decides to become a WAC officer... with predictable results. A fun movie, I really enjoyed this film. While some of the actors seemed a little wooden, this was because many of them were actual WACs assigned to Fort Lee at the time. Some of the scenes with the WACs going through ""environment trials"" for uniforms are especially hilarious! It's also notable for General Omar Bradley's brief appearance.",1379635200,,440,5.125
2385080,1,B000ACPALW,"Dismal.  Starts well; could have been fun.  Quickly becomes a boring, slapdash, slapstick film with no redeeming value.  The pairings are poor; the love triangles that could have been something never materialize.  Don't waste your time.",1379203200,,236,5.472222222222222

2385082,2,B000ACPALW,Nothing creative or interesting. Turn it off half way through and you won't care about the ending. Weird story line characters either unlikable or predictable.,1372550400,,159,5.4
2385083,4,B000ACPALW,"Even though I was there at Ft. Lee during the time the movie, ""Never Wave at a Wac"" was being made, I was there for Basic Training and we  ""passed in review""...in our ""Dress"" uniforms for the movie...

Never saw hide nor hair of the stars.  We were given instructions not to ""bother"" any movie people if we saw them.

When I did see the film I was surprised to realize how good of a movie it is.",1367193600,,395,4.0256410256410255
2385084,3,B000ACPALW,"---Cute, mindless film, about a society lady who is tricked into joining the WACs...The bright spots in the film, are, of course, Rossalind Russell and a darling star turn by Marie Wilson, who plays Roz's ditzy friend and fellow enlistee. The only glaring hole in the film--and it IS glaring---is the casting of PAUL DOUGLAS---as a romantic lead???? Ugh!!! Daffy Duck would have played the lead better in looks and in personality!! Douglas unfortunately ruined whatever ""suspension of disbelief"" I could have mustered towards the film, as I simply couldn't picture ANY woman falling for him (let alone, the vivacious and lovely Ms. Russell).....",1364688000,,645,5.211538461538462
2385085,4,B000ACPALW,"This is a great classic movie.  My interest was wanting until Jo McBain entered the WAC.  My, those instructors sure were much nicer than my Drill Sergeants were!

2385087,5,B000ACPALW,Great Classic comedy. As always Roslind Russell gives you great entertainment. I know have several of her movies and this is a classic.
