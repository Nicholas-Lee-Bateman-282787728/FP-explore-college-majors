4980650,2,B0069R253S,"This is an almost-complete compilation of Lee Van Cleef spaghetti westerns that are now in the public domain, i.e. for which the copyright has expired.  The only one missing, afaik, is ""Beyond The Law"".  There are many other spaghetti western compilations of public domain material, but I haven't found any that contain all six movies on this compilation.  Three or four movies at best.

In this compilation, all movies are displayed in 4:3 full screen even though they weren't all filmed that way.  As a result, you'll see characters with the tops of their heads cut off, half a person on the edge of the screen, etc.  One of the other compilations I have contains ""The Grand Duel"" in widescreen format, so I was disappointed to find it in full screen here.

The picture quality is neither better nor worse than any other public domain compilation I have.  If you've never seen one of these public domain compilations, picture quality is sub-par: it's noticeably worse than standard DVD quality, but not so bad that it's un-watchable.  If you have a large, high-def TV, you'll probably find the picture quality more annoying (don't watch a blu ray disc, then switch to one of these - you'll regret it).  I'll be watching these DVD's on my second TV, an old 27-inch 'standard' TV.

The two discs come in a metal case with embossed detail on the front - a nice touch.  But inside the case is a cheap piece of plastic that does a poor job of holding the discs.  I heard the discs sliding around inside the case even before I removed the shrink wrap.  When I opened the package, both discs had scratches on them (luckily, they did not affect the ability to play the discs).  I removed the cheap plastic piece and put the discs inside a couple of paper CD/DVD holders I had lying around.  You'll probably want to do the same.

The above adds up to a 2-star rating.  If you want to call it 3-stars because you're getting 6 movies for (at today's price) $7, that's up to you.  I'm not going to do so because of the questionable packaging and the fact that all movies (such as ""The Grand Duel"", available in widescreen format elsewhere) are in full screen format.  Had this come in a standard two-disc plastic case, or contained a widescreen presentation or two, I would have graded it higher.

Update: in March 2012, Encore Westerns (a standard definition channel, at least it's broadcast to me that way) showed 4 of the 6 movies on this compilation.  The picture quality for all was far superior to that on these DVD's.  So, I've recorded the Encore Western tv broadcasts to DVD-R's and placed them inside this set's metal box.  I'm not going to lower my rating for this set to 1 star, but I am tempted ...",1328572800,11,2701,4.544513457556936
8495412,4,B0069R253S,"Like the old westerns, they really knew how to make them. Especially like the ones with Lee Van Cleff and Clint Eastwood together.
