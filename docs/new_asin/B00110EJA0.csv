The set that came in a suitcase?  If so, then that set can still be bought for less than this release.  Or, has this been remastered?

3057858,5,B00110EJA0,"I was interested in this DVD set because I only saw a few episodes from the last season when I was 12 yrs. old.  The quality of the DVDs was good, except for the ""Iowa Scuba Affair.""  The shows were a bit campy, and it seemed the same set was used extremely often.  The acting however was superb, and the actors played off each other well.  (They were also easy on the eyes!)",1220140800,9,375,4.095890410958904
3057859,4,B00110EJA0,"I haven't had time to watch the episodes yet but while the DVD box sets inside are good the attache case box is terrible. It looks great, but since it's made of cardboard it doesn't stay in decent condition. I bought this set brand new from a private seller & was very disappointed when I received it to discover the corners already showed wear & the seams on both sides in the front (on the sides of the latches) were already torn/split so that I had to tape it up immediately. Since it was still sealed in the original plastic wrap & packed well, I don't blame the seller but it would have been nice to have it in a decent box to last more than 30 seconds out of the wrapper. Otherwise, I look forward to many hours watching my favorite TV spies.",1204848000,7,748,4.201388888888889

The episodes are transferred well enough,each season/year is numbered and color coded for easy referance,all 41 DVD's come in an attache case with handle. Each season/year comes with a booklet. There is some brief video distortion,and audio pops,but nothing serious enough to ruin your viewing/listening pleasure. To take out season 3, and season 4,you have to stand up the attache case and tilt it forward. Now the minus side-you get only 1 of the 8 1960's ""U.N.C.L.E.""movies[""One Spy Too Many""/1966],there is only one 'next week's episode'preview[""The Test Tube Killer Affair""],some episodes have scratches/blemishes to them here and there,the case the DVD's come in is made out of cardboard instead of plastic/metal,and the 1983 reunion movie,""The Return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E."",is also missing.

3057874,5,B00110EJA0,"I recently changed from one Medicare supplemental provider to another and got one of those ineffably STUPID phone calls from an alleged nurse working for the insurance company who was BSing me about how ""Medicare needed the answers"" to her questions.  This was bullspit, but I played along.  Most of the questions were about my mental state, like how often did I wake up depressed, etc.

At the end of the call I told her I knew that her company was just trying to cover its posterior with most of those questions but I was *so uplifted that I was going off to binge watch ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" -- she literally said, ""HUIH?  What is THAT?""

I tried to explain that it was a very silly, utterly false television show starring the recently deceased Robert Vaughn and David McCallum as a US secret agent and his Russian counterpart working for a fictional international peackeeping force.. i.e. the ""good guys"" fighting evil every week. I said the level of cartoon violence outdid Qintin Tarantino weekly in 51 minute segments cut up with commercials.  -- she replied ""WHO?""

I asked her if she'd ever seen the movie ""S.O.B."" by Blake Edwards, said Vaughn's bit part in that was a gem.  She'd never heard of the film.  I asked her if she'd heart of ""N.C.I.S"" and that David McCallum played Dr. 'Ducky' Mallard. the agency medical examiner.  She had seen that but didn't know about any of the other.

I realized I was old enough to be HER grandmother and she was allegedly a nursing school graduate.

In addition I realized she had no sense of humor,

Good grief.  Sit your younger relatives down and run a few of these episode for them and see if they're not laughing at the absurdity of them.

I'm really worried about the general level of humor in the younger folks in the U.S.  It takes intelligence AND a good education to laugh at a lot of things, and I'm wondering about how low we may be sinking.  This collection may be one of the antidotes.  We need a bit more idiotic buoyancy, IMO",1488585600,,1993,4.5195530726256985

Several episodes descend into very campy territory (girl raised by gorilla, anyone?) but there are some funny interviews where the actors talk about the show years later and joke about the campier episodes that were great to watch. Considering the time these were made, the effects are (mostly) credible  and stunt-double work is matched in pretty seamlessly.

3057889,5,B00110EJA0,"This is currently selling for about half price at a little over $50. This is a fantastic deal for the complete four seasons. It comes nicely packaged and the look and sound are in great quality.  There are also abundant behind the scenes extras. All of which are very interesting.  The recent demise of Robert Vaughn, who became famous from starring in the show, has stimulated renewed interest in this show. For those too young to remember, or those new to the show, here is a guide to the changing faces of the Man from UNCLE over the four seasons.

 The changing theme music for each of the four seasons reflects the tone of how the show changed.  This is not surprising since the title music is meant to convey what to expect from the show to anyone tuning in for the first time. In the first season, the theme music was scored by Jerry Goldsmith, who went on to become famous for scoring Star Trek movies  and many other famous movies The theme music for season one is orchestral and serious. The show was filmed in black and white and  was essentially a straight spy, action show  with a sprinkling of humor throughout. It was pitched mostly for a younger audience. But could be enjoyed by the whole family. The story plots were often suspenseful.  Notably, the visuals of the title sequence changed several times in the first season, along with the hairstyle of Robert Vaughn changing often. But by the middle of season one, the show found its stride. Each week the  incidental music was scored for that episode by different people.  But it reflected the main theme of the show's tone. Robert Vaughn was the star of season, the man from UNCLE, and David McCallum was his sidekick.  The show had some success. By season two, Lalo Schifrin was asked to write a new version of the theme music, using less musician  to reduce costs.  He later wrote the Mission Impossible theme and music for movies such as Dirty Harry and Enter the Dragon. This UNCLE version was more jazzy and cool, emphasizing the slick and smooth nature  of the show's heroes.  It was now really the Men from UNCLE, with David McCallum's character being given equal standing with that of Robert Vaughn's, due to popular demand from young, female fans.  The plots were mostly as good as those from season one, sometimes a little more far-fetched. The banter between the two main heroes and with their boss became more amusing, and increased the appeal of the show. Season two was the first season to be filmed in color. The producers  gave us elegant cars, exotic locations and colorful set design.  The personal communicators switched from cigarette cases to the famous pens. ""Open channel D."" Pre-dating the communicators of Star Trek, said to have inspired cell phones! The show aired at a more popular timeslot and was the most successful of the  four seasons, with up to 50% of TV sets in the USA tuning in to the Man from UNCLE. However, for season three, new produces gave a new flavor to the show. The theme music became overly jazzed up, straying away from the main theme itsel. This reflects where the show went wrong. The plots  became quite silly, with threats to world peace from things like hypnotized school girls and gas that caused hiccups!  The show still looked good, but began to lose its fan base. The disastrous spoof The girl from UNCLE was also now aired. Thankfully it is not included in this boxed set. But by association and due to its own misdirection, season three of the man from UNCLE disappointed fans of the show. The theme music for season four is somewhere between the style of season one and season two, reflecting a return to more serious themes.  But declining audiences from season three meant the show was now aired at a less popular time. So despite worthy efforts from everyone involved, the show was canceled about half way through . A pity, since it was getting back on track.

 I find the show is fun and relaxing entertainment before bedtime. Nothing too intense that's going to keep me awake. But  I'm not going to fall asleep during it, except maybe a few episodes from season three. The music from each episode of season two adds a lot  to the show, whereas in season 3 is so goofy, it can detract from what's happening. It was from season two music that Hugo Montenegro  wrote his highly successful album of man from uncle inspired music.

At about $50  for the four seasons and five discs of fascinating special features, this is a fantastic deal. There were several Man from UNCLE movies. These can be bought separately. However they are all slightly expanded versions of two part shows from the weekly TV show. So in my opinion, it is not worth it since you already have them here. This is a show I expect to watch again and again, though I will probably skip season three.",1482278400,10,4799,4.598591549295775

3057900,4,B00110EJA0,"This series is definitely a mixed bag.  The first season is one of the best seasons of a spy series of all time: good writing, real danger, well acted, great guest stars.  Napoleon Solo was truly cool under pressure.  The writers proceeded to ruin the show after that season, (think the first Lethal Weapon movie vs Lethal Weapon 3 or 4 or Twin Peaks Season One vs. Twin Peaks Season Two)  It is probably still worth getting the full series set to see everything, but you can see how they destroyed a show with an excellent beginning.  If you just bought Season One and saw how good it was, you would likely want to buy Season Two anyway, so you might as well get the whole series at a pretty reasonable price.  (Had this show ended after Season One, this show would have had the same, or better, cult following as The Prisoner; just an excellent show that inexplicably ended, leaving everyone wanting more.)  As it is, it very much wore out its welcome by the end.",1478822400,,965,4.418079096045198

The extras included here were not only entertaining but very informative.

And I'm not even sure it's because I enjoyed the movie.  Illya was a personal favorite, and he wasn't in the first two episodes except in the goofy intro (which I hope goes away, I'm up to the fifth episode in Season 1).

3057977,4,B00110EJA0,"I remember this show when I was a kid and I always liked suspenseful, ""whats going to happen next"" shows. This one is a true classic. The show revolves around British agents infiltrating World-Wide enemies to thwart their evil plans. Although there are pretty cool plot lines, I didn't realize they can be a bit corny. Maybe that's part of the entertainment. Plus, there are some good guest stars too.

This set comes in a cardboard box with 5 (4 series + 1 bonus) plastic DVDs cases. Each DVD case includes the discs for each season along with a folded insert with each episode title and a little tidbit of information about the shows.

This could have been a 5 star product if Warner had re-mastered the episodes and included stereo sound. I guess for about $60.00 this is a good deal to have the complete series with some extra bonus material including one of the Man From U.N.C.L.E. movies, i.e. One Spy Too Many.

Overall, I am happy to have this set in my DVD collection.",1442016000,2,977,4.508474576271187

3057981,5,B00110EJA0,"We used to watch this with great enjoyment when I was in middle school. This was around the height of the Cold War (just after Bay of Pigs) and the show was as timely for Baby Boomers as ""West Wing"" has been for GenX'ers.

I wanted to see if it aged well--because the Russians-as-Evil-Empire is not the same anymore, no matter what Putin is doing these days. Lo, it's just as captivating today as it was back in the Sixties, although I think I'm watching (binge-watching) these episodes with more than a bit of nostalgia.

The show aired from 1964 to 1968. Two secret agents,  Robert Vaughn playing Napoleon Solo (what a Sixties moniker) and David McCallum as Ilya Kuryakin, who was quite the heartthrob, believe me.  In the true Sixties secret agent tradition the organizations have acronyms: U.N.C.L.E. United Network Command for Law and Enforcement versus ""T.H.R.U.S.H."".

In this box series, there are 41 DVDs with 105 episodes:

SEASON 1 (1964-65) 10 DVDs-- 29 episodes
SEASON 2 (1965-66) 10 DVDS-- 30 episodes
SEASON 3 (1966-67) 10 DVDs-- 30 episodes

BUT - you can purchase the identical 41 discs new on Amazon for about the half the price of this package.  All that is new here IS the packaging - it is a slim format.  If that is important enough for you to spend an additional $80, then buy it.

I bought this set brand new from a private seller & was very disappointed when I received it to discover the corners already showed wear & the seams on both sides in the front (on the sides of the latches) were already torn/split so that I had to tape it up immediately.

3292371,5,B00110EJA0,"I recently changed from one Medicare supplemental provider to another and got one of those ineffably STUPID phone calls from an alleged nurse working for the insurance company who was BSing me about how ""Medicare needed the answers"" to her questions.  This was bullspit, but I played along.  Most of the questions were about my mental state, like how often did I wake up depressed, etc.

At the end of the call I told her I knew that her company was just trying to cover its posterior with most of those questions but I was *so uplifted that I was going off to binge watch ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" -- she literally said, ""HUIH?  What is THAT?""

I tried to explain that it was a very silly, utterly false television show starring the recently deceased Robert Vaughn and David McCallum as a US secret agent and his Russian counterpart working for a fictional international peackeeping force.. i.e. the ""good guys"" fighting evil every week. I said the level of cartoon violence outdid Qintin Tarantino weekly in 51 minute segments cut up with commercials.  -- she replied ""WHO?""

I asked her if she'd ever seen the movie ""S.O.B."" by Blake Edwards, said Vaughn's bit part in that was a gem.  She'd never heard of the film.  I asked her if she'd heart of ""N.C.I.S"" and that David McCallum played Dr. 'Ducky' Mallard. the agency medical examiner.  She had seen that but didn't know about any of the other.

I realized I was old enough to be HER grandmother and she was allegedly a nursing school graduate.

In addition I realized she had no sense of humor,

Good grief.  Sit your younger relatives down and run a few of these episode for them and see if they're not laughing at the absurdity of them.

I'm really worried about the general level of humor in the younger folks in the U.S.  It takes intelligence AND a good education to laugh at a lot of things, and I'm wondering about how low we may be sinking.  This collection may be one of the antidotes.  We need a bit more idiotic buoyancy, IMO",1488585600,,1993,4.5195530726256985

3292386,5,B00110EJA0,"This is currently selling for about half price at a little over $50. This is a fantastic deal for the complete four seasons. It comes nicely packaged and the look and sound are in great quality.  There are also abundant behind the scenes extras. All of which are very interesting.  The recent demise of Robert Vaughn, who became famous from starring in the show, has stimulated renewed interest in this show. For those too young to remember, or those new to the show, here is a guide to the changing faces of the Man from UNCLE over the four seasons.

 The changing theme music for each of the four seasons reflects the tone of how the show changed.  This is not surprising since the title music is meant to convey what to expect from the show to anyone tuning in for the first time. In the first season, the theme music was scored by Jerry Goldsmith, who went on to become famous for scoring Star Trek movies  and many other famous movies The theme music for season one is orchestral and serious. The show was filmed in black and white and  was essentially a straight spy, action show  with a sprinkling of humor throughout. It was pitched mostly for a younger audience. But could be enjoyed by the whole family. The story plots were often suspenseful.  Notably, the visuals of the title sequence changed several times in the first season, along with the hairstyle of Robert Vaughn changing often. But by the middle of season one, the show found its stride. Each week the  incidental music was scored for that episode by different people.  But it reflected the main theme of the show's tone. Robert Vaughn was the star of season, the man from UNCLE, and David McCallum was his sidekick.  The show had some success. By season two, Lalo Schifrin was asked to write a new version of the theme music, using less musician  to reduce costs.  He later wrote the Mission Impossible theme and music for movies such as Dirty Harry and Enter the Dragon. This UNCLE version was more jazzy and cool, emphasizing the slick and smooth nature  of the show's heroes.  It was now really the Men from UNCLE, with David McCallum's character being given equal standing with that of Robert Vaughn's, due to popular demand from young, female fans.  The plots were mostly as good as those from season one, sometimes a little more far-fetched. The banter between the two main heroes and with their boss became more amusing, and increased the appeal of the show. Season two was the first season to be filmed in color. The producers  gave us elegant cars, exotic locations and colorful set design.  The personal communicators switched from cigarette cases to the famous pens. ""Open channel D."" Pre-dating the communicators of Star Trek, said to have inspired cell phones! The show aired at a more popular timeslot and was the most successful of the  four seasons, with up to 50% of TV sets in the USA tuning in to the Man from UNCLE. However, for season three, new produces gave a new flavor to the show. The theme music became overly jazzed up, straying away from the main theme itsel. This reflects where the show went wrong. The plots  became quite silly, with threats to world peace from things like hypnotized school girls and gas that caused hiccups!  The show still looked good, but began to lose its fan base. The disastrous spoof The girl from UNCLE was also now aired. Thankfully it is not included in this boxed set. But by association and due to its own misdirection, season three of the man from UNCLE disappointed fans of the show. The theme music for season four is somewhere between the style of season one and season two, reflecting a return to more serious themes.  But declining audiences from season three meant the show was now aired at a less popular time. So despite worthy efforts from everyone involved, the show was canceled about half way through . A pity, since it was getting back on track.

 I find the show is fun and relaxing entertainment before bedtime. Nothing too intense that's going to keep me awake. But  I'm not going to fall asleep during it, except maybe a few episodes from season three. The music from each episode of season two adds a lot  to the show, whereas in season 3 is so goofy, it can detract from what's happening. It was from season two music that Hugo Montenegro  wrote his highly successful album of man from uncle inspired music.

At about $50  for the four seasons and five discs of fascinating special features, this is a fantastic deal. There were several Man from UNCLE movies. These can be bought separately. However they are all slightly expanded versions of two part shows from the weekly TV show. So in my opinion, it is not worth it since you already have them here. This is a show I expect to watch again and again, though I will probably skip season three.",1482278400,10,4799,4.598591549295775

3292397,4,B00110EJA0,"This series is definitely a mixed bag.  The first season is one of the best seasons of a spy series of all time: good writing, real danger, well acted, great guest stars.  Napoleon Solo was truly cool under pressure.  The writers proceeded to ruin the show after that season, (think the first Lethal Weapon movie vs Lethal Weapon 3 or 4 or Twin Peaks Season One vs. Twin Peaks Season Two)  It is probably still worth getting the full series set to see everything, but you can see how they destroyed a show with an excellent beginning.  If you just bought Season One and saw how good it was, you would likely want to buy Season Two anyway, so you might as well get the whole series at a pretty reasonable price.  (Had this show ended after Season One, this show would have had the same, or better, cult following as The Prisoner; just an excellent show that inexplicably ended, leaving everyone wanting more.)  As it is, it very much wore out its welcome by the end.",1478822400,,965,4.418079096045198

3292433,3,B00110EJA0,"Who doesn't like this series?  I remember watching this as a kid, eagerly awaiting each week''s new episode.  This collection doesn't disappoint.  The video is extremely sharp, and the audio is as clear as a bell.  My complaint is in the packaging.  I opened season one to find the case containing the first ten disks shattered.  This being a polypropylene plastic, I don't think it is repairable.  Maybe I'm being overly fussy, but for the price of this collection, I would have hoped the packaging would have been intact.",1451001600,,523,4.808988764044944

My only complaint is that Amazon has been so tempting with these specials. I need to cut back, but these will go to a good cause because after I watch them, I will donate them to our county library.",1449964800,,414,4.2405063291139244

I had every imaginable item that was marketed for this series. This set arrived earlier than promised and is worth every penny I paid for it. It will probably be a while before I am able to make it through every single episode, but it will be a certain pleasure to do so. It is functionally packaged, as to be expected from  United Network Command fot Law Enforcement.  See thats what UNCLE stands for. Anyone from my generation will remember this, and it should certainly be a part of their collection of classic TV.",1448582400,,635,4.410256410256411

3292445,5,B00110EJA0,"I can't believe how much I'm enjoying this series!  I loved it as a kid, but a lot of old shows are unwatchable today.  Not this one. Totally fun. And I'm not even sure it's because I enjoyed the movie.  Illya was a personal favorite, and he wasn't in the first two episodes except in the goofy intro (which I hope goes away, I'm up to the fifth episode in Season 1).  Then when he finally becomes partnered with Solo on cases, he seems more like a bungling buffoon.  I have a feeling I'm going to see this partnership evolve, and I'm having a great time doing so.",1445904000,2,564,4.185185185185185

3292474,4,B00110EJA0,"I remember this show when I was a kid and I always liked suspenseful, ""whats going to happen next"" shows. This one is a true classic. The show revolves around British agents infiltrating World-Wide enemies to thwart their evil plans. Although there are pretty cool plot lines, I didn't realize they can be a bit corny. Maybe that's part of the entertainment. Plus, there are some good guest stars too.

This set comes in a cardboard box with 5 (4 series + 1 bonus) plastic DVDs cases. Each DVD case includes the discs for each season along with a folded insert with each episode title and a little tidbit of information about the shows.

This could have been a 5 star product if Warner had re-mastered the episodes and included stereo sound. I guess for about $60.00 this is a good deal to have the complete series with some extra bonus material including one of the Man From U.N.C.L.E. movies, i.e. One Spy Too Many.

Overall, I am happy to have this set in my DVD collection.",1442016000,2,977,4.508474576271187

3292477,5,B00110EJA0,Great 060s. Spy drama with a tongue in cheekiness to delight all.,1441152000,,65,4.5
3292478,5,B00110EJA0,"We used to watch this with great enjoyment when I was in middle school. This was around the height of the Cold War (just after Bay of Pigs) and the show was as timely for Baby Boomers as ""West Wing"" has been for GenX'ers.

I wanted to see if it aged well--because the Russians-as-Evil-Empire is not the same anymore, no matter what Putin is doing these days. Lo, it's just as captivating today as it was back in the Sixties, although I think I'm watching (binge-watching) these episodes with more than a bit of nostalgia.

The show aired from 1964 to 1968. Two secret agents,  Robert Vaughn playing Napoleon Solo (what a Sixties moniker) and David McCallum as Ilya Kuryakin, who was quite the heartthrob, believe me.  In the true Sixties secret agent tradition the organizations have acronyms: U.N.C.L.E. United Network Command for Law and Enforcement versus ""T.H.R.U.S.H."".

In this box series, there are 41 DVDs with 105 episodes:

SEASON 1 (1964-65) 10 DVDs-- 29 episodes
SEASON 2 (1965-66) 10 DVDS-- 30 episodes
SEASON 3 (1966-67) 10 DVDs-- 30 episodes
SEASON 4 (1967-68) 6 DVDs-- 16 episodes

3292480,5,B00110EJA0,"Another retro-cool spy show on DVD! Growing up my local CBC affiliate aired BW reruns of U.N.C.L.E., so I have fond memories of the slick and cool spy series. I'd rank it just behind Patrick McGoohan's Danger Man/Secret Agent as my favorite of the 60s spy shows (The Prisoner is a different multi-hyphenate beast altogether). If you're a fan of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., a collector of television nostalgia, or just a lover of TV and movie secret agents, this is a must-own collection!",1440892800,,484,4.773809523809524

While it looks like all of the bonus features are listed in the box set description, I know one that is not: David McCallum's home movies. They'er great! He took his own camera and shot behind the scenes footage of the cast, crew sets and on location.  {if memory serves,} David does the narration. But for those of you who don't want to-or can't  spend the $$ on the complete set, can watch MFU on tv.  Those {of course} that get the station ME-TV, can watch it. It's been airing since August/September of last year. As part  of their ""The Spies Who Love Me"" block of shows {which also include Mission Impossible and Get Smart.}

I thought the shows wouldn't hold up in today's world.  Well, I was wrong.  They are entertaining from beginning to end.  The episodes are in black and white.  Not sure when they go to color.

3292497,5,B00110EJA0,"To be clear, the five stars are for the series itself - while it may seem retro now, it was very influential to those of us who watched it as teens in the mid 60s.

BUT - you can purchase the identical 41 discs new on Amazon for about the half the price of this package.  All that is new here IS the packaging - it is a slim format.  If that is important enough for you to spend an additional $80, then buy it. But search Man From UNCLE in Amazon and you will see the ""brief case"" packaging available as new for HALF the price of this item.  Same discs - they have not been remastered.
