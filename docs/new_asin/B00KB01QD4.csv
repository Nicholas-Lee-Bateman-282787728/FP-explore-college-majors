6411716,5,B00KB01QD4,"Nicely done. While the distributers may be UFOTV, the word UFO isn't mentioned one time. Neither is aliens as I can recall. This is a well produced and filmed trip into South America, from Mexico to Nicaragua, and other countries. Several museums are visited, but more than that, the trip has touches of the native peoples and is more broad at highlighting the various cultures of the past. I did learn some new things I didn't know before, that's a plus to me. I would almost call this a documentary. But you won't see any archaeologists doing a show like this, simply because they don't like to embarrass themselves when they don't have all the answers. David Childress is not afraid to say he doesn't know the answers to all these  mysteries, but that doesn't make the journey any less interesting. And we all like a good mystery.",1435190400,3,833,4.628378378378378
6411717,4,B00KB01QD4,I enjoyed this presentation. There could have been quite of bit more of ancient technology than what we are able to find today. And finding such technology would probably tell us how the people made pyramids that around the world. Or make other things.,1432857600,,252,4.75
6411718,5,B00KB01QD4,"Nice one !

Some Topics are discussed and researched where there is not much material there yet. Olmeks, Stone Balls and so on.  Nice capturing of the ancient sights.

What was a bit interesting for me, since its David Hatcher Childress... he didn't used the word extraterestials once :D ! Pretty uncommon, but no problem for me.

Btw. the aspect ratio is 16:9 and not 4:3 as it is stated in the details here !!!",1408492800,,412,4.453333333333333

6411759,1,B00KB01QD4,"David Hatcher sadly once again will show and discuss ancient artifacts giving explanations from theories of Atlantis and various UFO related stories. He throws out the one Book that explains all of these discoveries and how they came about.  The Bible in Gen Chapter 6 speaks clearly of the Nephillim they had the technology and the size to build such large structures it also speaks of them not only having sex with women but leaving there habitat in the Heavens with the fallen one and having strange flesh sex with animals.  The nephillim and there off spring did everything to get man to worship them after the flood which caused these huge rocks ( which were probably made for a simple game due to there size 10 to 20 tons is nothing to the Nephillim. The book of Enoch explains these events and picks up again in the New Testament in Jude were it is clear as in the days of Noah which were the Nephillim there is nothing in outer space these demonic entities are inter demensional this author will say anything as long as he leaves God out the creator DNA itself requires a Creator, Satans job is to keep you and others from seeking real truth written in the dead sea scrolls to the Bible ( sorry of the mis spelled words) cant locate my reading glasses at 3 am",1475625600,,1267,4.4334763948497855

6411767,4,B00KB01QD4,I have watched David Childress on the Ancient Alien series and he is very entertaining. He tended to be very repetitive in his presentation which was distracting but the information was certainly informative and enjoyable to watch.,1470960000,,231,5.27027027027027

8657054,5,B00KB01QD4,"Not sure if anyone else found it, but there's a drinking game utilizing the word ""Balls"" Between 00:06:00 and 8:30:00 or so.  I lost when the reference ""Giant Balls of the Gods"" arrived at 00:08:09.  The little balls are just oddball items buried with chieftains.  But balls frequents the dialogue thereafter as well.  Aside from that, pretty entertaining and usually follow up some of the grandiose claims with some sort of evidence.  At times, solid indisputable evidence.  I still say delivery method is critical when conveying unconventional archaeology/anthropology/geology/paleontology.  This guy is amazing.  No wonder Ancient Aliens picked him up.  Excellent speaker.  Balls.",1507420800,,683,5.607843137254902
