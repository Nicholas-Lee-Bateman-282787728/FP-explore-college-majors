7891437,3,6305538352,"Dr. Phillip Rothman is a professor running audio and visual experiments for extra credit to improve video game graphics using volunteers from his classes, but the side effects cause homicidal and suicidal impulses in the subjects, eventually including himself. Even during the experiment, emotions are manipulated to cause ecstatic reactions as well as disturb*. As these triggers sublimate, they turn into virtual zombies when likened stimuli is experienced while going about their lives, demonstrating trance-like symptoms and sudden aggression. A detective becomes suspicious when a series of apparently senseless murders become prevalent.

 The film begins with a girl hanging herself for no apparent reason. Another girl seeking to improve her grades through ""extra-curricular"" activities essentially becomes addicted and overdoses in the laboratory as the program initiates pleasure likened orgasmic bliss initially, which then becomes sensory overload, transforming her into a mindless killing machine; while another girl with a sweet disposition takes an axe to some classmates during a Halloween party. While being questioned by the detective, another paranoid subject commits suicide by jumping out a window. The professor decides to preserve the corpse's head for cerebral analysis, despite the efforts of the detective to retain the body in the morgue for autopsy.

 The professor eventually learns this project is a secret plan by certain secret agencies to initiate mind control upon the populace, that he was merely a pawn, and is stifled for his discovered knowledge. The film concludes with a boy playing video games  exhibiting sociopathic behavior.

But BRAIN TWISTERS is really bad, so why would you want it?

When I read the description -- campus college experiment turns students into crazed psycho killers -- I thought I was in for a horror/slasher film. It's NOT. The killings are few and far between, and not very graphic.

This plays like a TV movie, with less suspense. A BORING film about a BORING college professor -- actor Terry Londeree often looks like he's falling asleep, with his weak smile, atonal voice, and sleepy eyes -- whose experiment causes some students to kill (mostly off-camera). Then a BORING police detective, with a mostly cardboard delivery, investigates. There's also an evil corporate CEO who now and again talks to the professor on the phone, because his company is funding the research. Yak, yak, yak.

Amid all this, some mostly LISTLESS students wander about, until sometimes there's a killing (not often enough). The listless actors include the boring Farrah Forke, mostly known for her role on TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wings/dp/B001QU9RSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wings</a>. Apart from a few scenes, her face usually looks like it's shot full of Novocaine. She gawks a lot in this film, which I guess means that her character is perplexed or puzzled.

Not much suspense in this film. We all know from the start what's going on. This film is no mystery. Just waiting for something to happen. But since we don't care about these boring characters, it doesn't really matter when something does happen.

I fast forwarded through the last 10 minutes just to see how it would end. I rarely fast-forward through films. A film has to be mind-numbingly dull to impel me to fast-forward.",1369612800,,2003,5.594059405940594
7891439,1,6305538352,"Some movies go with the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" philosophy.  If you throw enough generic elements into a movie, it just has to be good.  Conversely, if a director takes the elements of one or more genres and puts the elements into a movie without a bit of creativity, the result could be similar to this movie.

This movie seems much like a typical slasher film.  We have a variety of scenes that appear vaguely disturbing, with strange or sinister characters at every turn.  A number of scenes have the slasher perspective, so we know where the slasher is, though the victim does not.  However, other than have the accouterments of a slasher film, this movie is actually a schlock science fiction movie.

You would hope for something that is not stereotypical in this movie, but you may as well forget about that.  We have a corporation that is funding the work of Dr. Philip Rothman.  Naturally, anyone connected with a large corporation that wears a suit and rides in the backseat of a car must be evil (stereotype alert).  Dr. Rothman shows flashy lights in a little booth to various people, consisting mostly of young, reasonably good-looking female students (stereotype alert).  Apparently the flashy light thingy is supposed to be part of a mind control experiment, and the software for the mind control is going to be installed in video games (stereotype alert).

Caught up in the paranoid nonsense and experimentation is Laurie Stevens, played by Farrah Forke.  Forke is the only actor in this movie who went on to have a career in acting, starting with an on-going role in ""Wings"" the year after starring in this movie, her first.  Laurie gets the flashy light treatment from Dr. Rothman, but the treatment just ramps up her libido, a little (really little), and she kisses the target rather than killing him; oopsie!

Laurie wanders around campus looking generally morose and sad, as various people on campus kill themselves and other students, though not necessarily in that order.  It would all be fun, except the action is slightly faster than watching grass growing.  There are a few, all too brief moments of suspense, but the movie lets those moments go to waste.  I could provide more details about the non-excitement, but you have the gist of what is happening.

This movie has a few moments where it seems like it will take on the most stereotypical elements of slasher films, nudity, wanton sex, blood, gore, extended chase scenes through the woods, and the not-so-occasional expletive, but the movie backs away from these elements at what seems to be the brink.  We do see what appears to be blood in a couple of scenes, but the appearance of the blood seems inconsistent with the attacks that cause the blood, so the appearance is more humorous than terrifying.

When you get to the far side of the movie, there is the obligatory final scene that suggests the end is far from over (trust me, it is over).  Oh, my, is it possible that video games are being used by large corporations to establish mind control over our children?  Only if you are a paranoid person who believes there is a nefarious plan behind the actions of corporations and governments.

This movie bears some similarities to other movies, beyond just the slasher stereotypes.  Depending on the aspect of mind control, some other movies in this genre might be ""Videodrome,"" ""Dreamscapes,"" ""Mirage,"" ""Conspiracy Theory,"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate.""  All these movies handled the subject much better than this movie, in more interesting and intriguing ways.  Indeed, if you are looking for a movie where someone is either being controlled or trying to control someone through some kind of brainwashing or mind control, try any of the aforementioned movies rather than this one.

As a side note, the picture quality seems quite good, as is the sound, which should be expected for a film from 1991.

With so many good movies in the world, the only reason that would justify purchase of this film is that you must have all the movies about brainwashing or mind control.  Alternatively, perhaps you are a huge Farrah Forke fan and you must have every film in which she has appeared.

Incidentally, if you want a good twist (or twister), try ""Peppermint Twist"" by Joey Dee and the Starlighters, ""The Twist"" by Chubby Checker (""Let's twist again...""), or the game ""Twister.""  While none of these will twist your brain, they are far more fun than this movie.

7891440,1,6305538352,"Dr. Philip Rothman (Terry Londeree), a somewhat smug creepy Eric Roberts type, experiments on the minds of his willing students. It appears to be an alpha wave manipulator with a 70's soundtrack. The subjects turn into killers and then commit suicide. There isn't much of a mystery or plot.

The plot was simple and the characters shallow. Looked like a made for TV movie. Film was outdated when it was made.

7891441,2,6305538352,"Disclaimer: This film is included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gorehouse-Greats-Collection/dp/B002DHACSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gorehouse Greats Collection</a>, which is the version I saw.  As such, I cannot comment on the quality of this individually packaged disc offered from this page.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.

Considering that only Farrah Forke, the lead actress in 'Brain Twisters', went on to have any kind of success in acting, and that the overwhelming majority of the other players only have this one film to their credit, it is surprising that this low-rent 'sci-fi thriller' isn't unwatchable.  Yes, Terry Londerdee, as the mad neuro-scientist Dr. Rothman, is about as expressive as a stump, but for all that, the rest of the acting chores are handled rather well - or at least as well as anyone could expect for an early '90's schlock science-fiction film put out by Crown International Pictures (it's always best to go into these sort of things hoping for the best but expecting the worst).  In fact, there are several elements to the film that could have been excruciatingly awful, but somehow the filmmakers shucked and jived their way to near mid-field.  From there though, it's three-and-out, with a shanked punt - little of interest and little to recommend.

A shadowy corporate entity is funding a college professor as he experiments with the effect of certain projected images on the stimulation centers of the brain.  The corporation's ultimate goal is to subliminally place these colorful and random flashes of light into the background of their video games, thus stimulating areas of the brain and creating a product as addictive as ... video games, I guess.  However, once the Pandora's box of the brain is levered open with the stimulus, what comes out isn't always pretty.

Neither are the primitive graphics of this early '90's release, though we are saved from having to watch too much of the 'amazing special effects' of Commodore 64 computer technology - the filmmakers were probably rescued by budget concerns.  Instead, we simply get a hint of the professor's experiments, which works in the film's favor.  And those who still remember the 'Nineties Kind Of Guy' will appreciate Joe Lombardi's pastel performance of the police detective assigned to the case.  Additionally, Ms Forke is such a pleasant Girl Next Door as one of the mad doctor's students, I'd be willing to watch another of her films based purely on the job she does here.

Now that I've rather archly described how bad this film isn't, it's time to backpeddle - it isn't really any good, either.  It's south of mediocre because it isn't interesting, with few of the staples of B-Movie science-fiction or horror to spice up the story.  And except for the last scene in the movie, there isn't anything kooky enough - intentional or no - to recommend it either (but I did get a chuckle out of the last thirty seconds.  I'll keep it to myself in the interest of avoiding spoilers, but it might be the unintentional best part of the entire film - just not enough to redeem it).  No nudity that I remember (and I'm not watching it again to verify, no matter what you say), and only one F-Bomb that I recall.  Hardly enough gore to be included in the 'Gorehouse Greats', or to be rated R - more of a PG-13 quickie in the style of the Lame and the Innocuous.

Watch it if you must, but if so, do yourself a favor and pick it up on one of the several multi-packs in which it's included (but skip the two-fer release with 'Prime Evil'.  That film is so bad the studio should include a five-dollar bill inside the DVD slipcase and retail it for 1.99).  Sound and picture were completely serviceable for 'Brain Twisters' in the Gorehouse Greats edition, surely as good as this Rhino plain-jane release.  Plus you get other movies to throw popcorn at too.  Bonus!",1288224000,3,3948,4.946969696969697
