5026295,1,B006WY0VRU,"In this DVD, by Discovery Channel, Stephen Hawking gives his reasons that there be no god required to explain the existence of the universe by pointing out firstly that the mass in the universe is balanced by the negative energy of space such that this could all have come from nothing thus needing no creator and secondly that time only started with the big bang leaving no place in which a creator could have created the universe. This part of the DVD is fine.

  A 20 minute discussion on the existence of god is included in the DVD including some scientists but only those who believe in god such as Paul Davies a well known science author.  Comment is made refuting Stephens views while ignoring other reasons to believe in a lack of god such as the commonly understood view of Richard Dawkins that the god itself is too complex to have just come into being or always existed so that by the logic that demanded the existence of the god to create a complex universe you would also need an infinite number of gods each having been created by another.  The god itself is attributed with the complex traits of self awareness, the cognitive ability to understand the universe, and the ability to bring the universe into being.  Thus the use of god to account for the creation of the universe only puts the question of the origin of complexity back a step rather than resolving it, and further shows the existence of such a complex thing as a god to be extremely unlikely as follows.

 The argument raised against Stephen's ideas involved the use of the idea of the multiverse but makes no mention of the well known idea that with an infinite number of universes in the multiverse that the apparent unlikely nature of physical laws in the universe just happening to allow for the existence of life is no longer a valid argument in favour of the need of a creator because an infinite number of such universes each with their own laws will statistically likely create some that allow for life.  Nor is it mentioned that as we learn more the apparent impossibilities of various aspects of a naturally caused 'creation' become understandable as natural occurrences, such as evolution showing how complex organisms and eco-systems could exist without the need of a god creating them, and that as we learn more again, and hypothetically everything, then more again, and hypothetically everything, could be explained without the need to resort to a god.  There is, however, no such explanation that would allow for the complexity of a god to have come about.  I think Stephen Hawking refers to the use of god to explain the shrinking number of unexplained aspects of the universe as the ""God of the gaps"".

  Not to mention the likely hood of a god creating such cruel eco-systems where almost all animals are torn to pieces by predators or starve when to old to hunt if they don't first die from terrible injury or one or more of god's hideous diseases.

  I emailed Discovery Channel asking the following questions but they said that their data base, although containing much information, did not contain that which I had asked for.  That is to say they did not answer the questions.

- was Stephen Hawking or others given opportunity to reply?

- did he know a discussion only involving those of religious beliefs that often had poor logic  and failed to even mention other well known reasons for the lack of existence of god would follow?

- do you think that such a biased and poor discussion effects the credibility of the Discovery Channel?

  Possibly Discovery Channel was concerned for market reasons that in a very superstitious country, such as the USA, that many people could react against such a DVD if it lacked Christian propaganda.  It is also possible that such propaganda was included because of superstitious beliefs of those involved with Discovery Channel.

  The inclusion of superstitious propaganda in this manner harms the credibility of both Discovery Channel and those involved in the discussion, including Paul Davies, who would have been knowledgeable of the above mentioned major floors and omissions of the arguments used for the existence of god and the apparent lack of opportunity of others to reply to criticisms made.

  When I watch documentaries I want information presented to be both correct and complete so due to their lack of credibility I will never buy anything from Discovery Channel again, nor from Paul Davies.

  There are of course other books on these subjects but I've included those I have at least read.  I included above a book on creation science but did not include one on intelligent design as I am waiting for one to arrive called God, the Devil, and Darwin: A Critique of Intelligent Design Theory, although not having read it yet I can't say more than that it exists. There are also books on the psychology of why people maintain superstitious beliefs even in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence but I have not yet got around to any.",1343952000,18,6761,4.829991281604185
5026296,5,B006WY0VRU,"Is there a God? Hawking considers this a valid question for science. He also points out that the universe is not as mysterious or fearsome as it once appeared. Starting with the Greek philosopher Aristarchus (310 - 230 B.C.) our understanding of natural phenomena has improved, though very slowly until recent years. Aristarchus realized the Earth was not the center of the Universe and explained the eclipse of the moon. Unfortunately, his insight did not become pervasive and even the Vikings were terrified of the sight centuries later. Aristarchus also realized that the stars were actually other suns, not light shining through holes in the floor of the Universe. Galileo (1609) saw the four moons of Jupiter with his telescope and saw that as proof the Universe doesn't revolve around Earth, and weakened the grip of the Church on science.

Hawking then poses the question, ""If the laws of nature are fixed, what role is there for God?"" He asserts that science doesn't deny religion, it just offers a simpler alternative.

Our Universe needs matter/energy and space. Per Hawking, when the Big Bang produced energy and matter, it also created negative energy/matter stored in space. Thus, the Universe adds up to nothing, and one doesn't need a God to have created it when it exploded from a size smaller than a proton. Illustrating his logic for negative energy/matter, Hawking points out that when we make a hill, we also simultaneously make a hole from which the material is removed.

Nothing caused the Big Bang. Time began with the Big Bang, and did not exist prior to that point. Thus there was no time for a Creator to have existed and made the Universe.

An added feature on the DVD shows evidence of primitive life forms on Mars found on a rock that landed in the Antarctica 13,000 years ago. Aliens could attack the earth by first sending multiple electromagnetic pulses - inactivating everything electronic. This could be followed by high-speed kinetic energy directed into coastal waters that create tsunamis and kill up to two billion. Biological warfare could be next. Nuclear weapons exploded in space against alien craft would have little/no effect. Our only plausible defense would be based on a 'Thunder Well' directed at the alien's spaceship.",1340755200,27,2267,4.98941798941799
5026297,5,B006WY0VRU,Everyone should view this video.  And take away what you will.  Hawking presents his interpretation of how things work although I think he is limiting his assessment to a singular view.  I think he needs to back away a bit and let the sun shine in.  He has his point(s) and he has certainly earned the right to them.  I just think there are more than one big bang and that they are happening all the time all over existence.,1340582400,6,424,4.25

5026320,1,B006WY0VRU,"I am scientifically oriented, and have yet to find convincing FACTS disproving the possibility that higher powers than the human mind (and intellectual's arrogance) might exist in physical nature. Hawking's arguments, while selectively citing legitimate facts and laws of nature are, in my opinion, nothing more than the wildest of speculation and completely unworthy of serious consideration. While the presentation was very professional and graphically attractive, I consider my purchase a waste of money from a knowledge acquisition point-of-view. It is recommended that young and impressionable mature people should be thoroughly cautioned about the lack of veracity in consensus opinions within the academic and elitist community built on arguments like Hawking's before viewing this program.",1393977600,,797,5.939130434782609

5026323,2,B006WY0VRU,"I was disappointed in this. I was looking for more intelligent discussion involving actual science, and not a speculative entertaining cartoon about possible life forms.
