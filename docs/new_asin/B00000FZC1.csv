1212637,4,B00000FZC1,this movie will not win any awards but it does give you a perspective of how we can cause a lot of our own problems from not allowing people to help us and take counsel from others.

1212639,5,B00000FZC1,I've shown this movie to all my best friends.  Keri Russell is amazing as Erica French.  It's honestly one of my favorite performances of hers.
