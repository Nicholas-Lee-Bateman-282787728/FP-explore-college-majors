It is supposed to be a movie where a woman recounts her years of child sexual abuse, but to be quite honest, I feel most of the disturbing scenes could have been acted differently, could have been made without having to show the nudity of the actresses involved. But, giving the producer the benefit of the doubt, I'll let you know the movie gives you all the turmoils people who have been abused go through mentally. It is an inside look at abuse from someone who has been there. The movie shows the woman at her current age (I think in her late 30's) and flashed back to when she was 8 years old and when she was 14 . And for each character there is a shocking scene. At the very least, the movie is controversial, and I would compare it to the Brooke Shields movie Pretty Baby, which also deals with abuse. It is certainly not a movie for the whole family to view. Also note that older vhs editions of the movie on vhs are produced better (film quality)",1239062400,,994,4.264550264550264

It is a movie about a woman's view of child abuse and its after effects before the idea had hit the main stream. It is intense and Ms. Ross decides to pull no punches when it comes to her anger. While trying to track down Ms. Ross for her permission to use her film as part of my band's live show, I talked to the director of photography,  Mr. Ted V. Michaels (normally known for his indie horror movies). Being a really nice guy, we talked for a while and he gave me a great deal of insight into the film that made me appreciate it all the more.

***WARNING*** Some of the scenes are graphic. There is a good deal of nudity, two kinda  kinda graphic sex scenes , and intense psychological scenes thrown in thoughout. (One review of the movie said two scenes bordered on soft-core porn.) However, props to Ms. Ross as she filmed and edited the rape and abuse scenes to make you wince and get grossed out but you are never shown anything that could be considered obscene.

Maybe by today's standards some parts are a bit dated, but what she did was very very original for the time. These days with a video camera it is much easier to do such a work. She had a great deal of stamina to make her film happen. I recommend that all indie film makers see it as a reference point.

It is a shame that Doreen Ross lef the movie business just before she could have had the chance to ride the wave in independent films, especially those about women. I am STILL trying to find her to get her permission. If anyone knows where she is, please contact me thru my site [...]",1119744000,4,1631,4.214743589743589
