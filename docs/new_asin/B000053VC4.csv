7930534,5,B000053VC4,"JOHNNY SKIDMARKS is one of those movies that debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, and then shipped off to HBO.  A shame, as this dark, disturbing film is brilliant.  Director John Roffo gives us a ""noir"" feel with some really catchy oldies played throughout.  Peter Gallagher stars as Johnny, a crime scene photographer, who is also making some money on the side by taking pictures in a blackmail scam.  Things turn sour when Johnny's cohorts start turning up dead, and it looks like Johnny's next.  Gallagher is at his best in his role as a man who has stopped participating in life, has stopped caring, has stopped feeling.  He doesn't want to know anything about the people he photographs, either on his crime scene job or his blackmailing.  He has a brother in law, played well by Jack Black, who runs a clown burger joint(...).  Gallagher meets up with Frances McDormand (brilliant as always) as a newcomer who just might have some connection with his blackmailing scam.  The ever chameleonic John Lithgow appears as Larry, Johnny's detective friend, who seems to encourage Johnny to feel a little more.  Geoffrey Lower adds some macho depth in his role as Larry's partner, who for some reason just doesn't like Johnny.  In a small role, lovely Charlie Shadling portrays Lorraine, the hooker the blackmailers use in their scams.
This is a dark and unsettling film, and the finale on the rooftop is gut-wrenching in its brutal honesty.
A very good film, overlooked, but worth seeing!",1082592000,12,1489,4.869047619047619
