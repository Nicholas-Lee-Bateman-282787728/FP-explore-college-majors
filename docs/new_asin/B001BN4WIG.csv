3495267,1,B001BN4WIG,"By my calculation, one can order the 5 seasons separately (the 1-3 set, plus the 4th and 5th) for approximately sixty-three dollars less than the cost of this set.

How stupid do they think we are?

To be fair, I do not own this set. Does it come in a gold-inlaid wooden box or some such?  Somehow, I doubt it.  If it came in a attache case complete with replica self-destructing tape player, it still wouldn't be worth it.",1227052800,7,423,4.3164556962025316

8283661,3,B001BN4WIG,"I'm on the second box now - still no Peter Graves. I purchased Seasons 1-5 because I liked watching as a child. Today the action seems ""slow"" and tedious as well as predictable. Movies of this venue today are complex, lots of special effects, fantastic car chases, etc. Sometimes I can barely sit through a complete episode even though this was a dvd of ""my choice"". I like ""excitement"", this has lost its lusture.",1283644800,,414,4.608108108108108
8283662,5,B001BN4WIG,"This show is one of the standards of classic TV.  Unfortunately, it does not get rerun, and I have not seen it in syndication since the early 80's.  It is dated, but it also showcases the very best automobiles and gadgetry that was available in the 60's.  It is very entertaining, and if you know LA, you can spot a number of locations easily.  The writers used a formula, which is consistent with each episode.  Someone almost gets caught, something almost gets given away, the ""scam"" which goes over on the bad guys is always subject to being timed exactly right, and the end of the show is the last moment in the story where the viewer knows the team has been successful.  It is like a James Bond movie without James Bond.  I sit and watch a couple of episodes every night after my son goes to sleep, just like when it was in reruns during the 70's.  Even though the scripts are a product of the Cold War era, the episodes consistently deliver believable situations and tense drama.",1267574400,,985,4.433333333333334
8283663,5,B001BN4WIG,The quality of the discs are excellent so far.  I still have the 4th & 5th season to watch but don't foresee any problems.  The cost was a little high but was well worth it.,1267401600,,173,3.914285714285714
8283664,5,B001BN4WIG,"I am enjoying the Mission Impossible set.  The quality is great and the episodes are fantiastic.  Exactly what I expected.

8283666,1,B001BN4WIG,This is a great series and good family entertainment.  I own the seasons and bought them individually.  AMAZON needs to make it easy for consumers to find the BEST PRICE/SALE PRICE/ together or separately.  The set prices should ALWAYS be lower than the individual items.  The set price is listed at $224.  The price of each season is currently $20 (Season 1) to $35 (Season 5).  Save MORE THAN $100 by purchasing the seasons individually.  It is difficult to have confidence with AMAZON pricing policies!!!!,1237939200,3,508,4.905882352941177
8283667,1,B001BN4WIG,This is a very expensive Pack.  If you buy each season individually it will cost $155.95 as of today.  That is a savings of $69.04.  I love Mission Impossible but whoever put the price tag on this Pack obviously did not do their math at all.,1229731200,8,241,4.195652173913044
8283668,5,B001BN4WIG,"I purchased these five seasons individually and the quality is beyond superb.  However, another reviewer had it correct when saying the current price is too high for the bundle.  Consider buying these seasons individually instead.",1228262400,7,230,5.542857142857143
