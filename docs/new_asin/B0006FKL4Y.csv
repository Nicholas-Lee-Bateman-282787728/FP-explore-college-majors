8041282,5,B0006FKL4Y,"Outstanding, I would recommend this DVD set to any serious baseball coach or athlete who wants to improve his team or hitting abilities. I personally have been looking for something like this for a long time. Dave Hudgens does an excellent job of breaking all the information down into simple steps from hitting to off season training.",1170288000,3,335,4.894736842105263
