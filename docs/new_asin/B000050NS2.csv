1386045,5,B000050NS2,"This movie is hard to find but great fun to watch.  Many of the cast are young performers who are now well known. (John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum, Ellen Barkin, Christopher Lloyd and a pre robocop Peter Weller) Buckaroo Banzai doesn't try to be anything but fun.  A bigger than life hero, an alien invasion, comedy, some action and a little romance too. I've been a fan for many years.  I've been trying to find this movie for a long time so I could add it to my collection of favorite movies.",974419200,6,490,4.362637362637362
1386046,5,B000050NS2,"'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' nearly defies definition! A cult classic, this send-up of alien invasion stories, pulp fiction heroes, and adventure movies is a love/hate proposition; while I found it to be brilliant fun, many of my friends thought it was incomprehensible! One thing for sure...There is NO other film quite like it!
Buckaroo (played with laid-back coolness by Peter Weller) is a Japanese/American race car driver/neurosurgeon/rock star/comic book hero who, with his rock 'n roll commandos, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, balances his time between saving lives, pushing the boundaries of science, troubleshooting for the President, and playing gigs in nightclubs (lost, yet?). The film opens with his performing surgery, recruiting a new Cavalier member (a pre-stardom Jeff Goldblum), then hopping into a prototype race car, supposedly to break the land speed record, but actually to test a device that would allow man to travel through solid objects by adjusting their molecular density! (NOW are you lost?)
The experiment works, but thrusts Bonzai temporarily into the Eighth Dimension, a kind of Phantom Zone for criminals from Planet Ten. The breech allows an alien invasion to begin, as  Planet 10 stormtroops (frog-faced creatures who all take the names of various celebrities named 'John') get their marching orders, and invade New Jersey!
This is not the first time the Eighth Dimension has been breeched; in 1938, Dr. Lizardo (John Lithgow, in his funniest performance ever) attempted a similar experiment, but his head became stuck, temporarily, in the hole! An alien presence entered his mind, and Lizardo was shipped off to a mental hospital, where he plotted the destruction of the human race (""Laugh-a while you can, monkey boy! You all are-a gonna die!"") Freed by the invasion force, Lithgow begins to carry out his threat!
Meanwhile, Bonzai meets Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin, in an early performance), the twin sister of his lost love, while the Hong Kong Cavaliers are performing at a gig, and begins wooing her with his philosophy of life (""No matter where you go...there you are."") A frantic call from the President and a murder attempt breaks up the romantic interlude, and the adventure REALLY begins! (If you aren't lost by now, you may just be a Buckaroo fan!)
The film careens from one climax to another, scarcely allowing the viewer time to think (which, in a film like this, may be a GOOD thing!). Director W.D. Richter deftly keeps the tone light, although there is a heartbreaking death scene tossed in. As the situation grows more desperate, alien Black Lectoids, and the Buckaroo Bonzai Fan Club (Team Banzai) arrive to lend a hand! Will Good triumph? Will Buckaroo find happiness with Penny Priddy? Will the sequel, with Buckaroo taking on a world crime syndicate, ever be made? (Sadly, as the film bombed in it's initial release, THAT appears unlikely!)
Loaded with more imagination than any three films you can name, and a oddball sense of humor, to boot, 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai' is a wonderful, wacky triumph, that challenges you to toss aside preconceptions, and 'enjoy the ride'!
I HIGHLY recommend it!",973209600,127,3163,5.12984496124031

It's the most clever & CAMPY sci-fi send up I have ever seen. Just a jewel of raw, over the top, movie making.  All the main acting is great but Lithgow deserves the oscar for his outstanding performance.  Gets better each repeat viewing because the zingers continue to sink in.

The story line (and the backstory!) is pretty cool, especially if you understand the culture of the 1980s  this should be a required reading/viewing in a 1980s media appreciation course.

It is the Casablanca of film fantasy.",1490572800,,262,5.55
1386075,5,B000050NS2,"Buckaroo Banzai is one of those films I go back and watch again every few years. The eclectic plot line, characters and (by today's standards) hilarious special effects are a lot of fun. But what really makes this movie worth going back to is the cast. Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum and many others that were in this film saw their careers flourish in the following years.

The movie is filled with over-the-top humor and crazy plot twists. Lithgow's Dr. Lizardo is stunning but don't discount  Weller's or Goldblum's performances either. I still laugh at how all the aliens are named John... Of course, in the end Buckarro saves the world (we are all still here, right?).

I'm kind of sorry there wasn't a sequel. The film seemed to keep that possibility open. Decades too late now.

You gotta know if I keep coming back to this film I'm going to give it 5 stars. I see it very differently now then I did back when it first came out, but I enjoy it every bit as much if not more.",1490486400,10,992,4.434065934065934

1386077,5,B000050NS2,"My third viewing -- at long last after decades of not seeing it.  This is a film that is sinfully silly and refuses to explain itself, and if it weren't a relic-classic, it would be but lowly regarded across the theatrical spectrum.  Tons of bits that worked.  Money was spent, yep.  Embarrassing to watch as way back then, check.  Funny, yet still to this day.  And 30 year old Barkin is not to be missed -- eat your heart out Scarlett Johansson lushily adorable that you are.

Last time I saw this, I was in another world -- many old patterns were not triggered, but well do I remember my youthful resonances with its various parts.

Thing's change.

Now, one major dynamic saturates this experience -- poignancy.  Seeing such familiar actors whose careers were yet to come -- I knew their individual fates when they did not -- each so innocent about destiny and I so certain of it.  Like I said, poignancy.",1490054400,3,909,4.515337423312883

The movie is a modern answer to Flash Gordon , Buck Rogers, Doc Savage and the like . This very smart , fast-paced, colorful , well written , well acted, and well directed. The production value is really high for 1984.

Both travel the world with a band of men, but Buckaroo's men are a musical band. The men in both groups go by colorful nicknames. Both films performed poorly at the box office, and promoted an ambiguous sequel that was never made. However, Buckaroo gets involved with women and uses guns, where Doc does not, nor would Doc promote himself with Rock and Roll and comic books. There are also comparisons to Sherlock Holmes, such as Mrs. Johnson (Mrs. Hudson) and the Blue Blazer Regulars (Baker Street Irregulars).

Robocop was far and away the best of them. Buckaroo is not the worst, but it's no Robocop. Weller's deadpan acting, which works fine as Robocop, is a black hole here, leaving Lithgow to furnish 9/10ths of the energy.

After seeing it several more times, I still don't know exactly what's going on, but don't care any more. The cast features a whole rack of actors who were just starting up the star-curve, like Peter Weller, Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin and Christopher Lloyd.

1386149,4,B000050NS2,"It is admittedly difficult to give a bizarre, flawed movie like THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE EIGHTH DIMENSION 5 stars.  I thought the same thing about Big Trouble In Little China which is another great 80's B-movie that W.D Richter also had a hand in creating.  Richter wrote-adapted Big Trouble for John Carpenter's very belated cult hit (sounds familiar).
But, W.D Richter Directed and produced BUCKAROO BANZAI; and if you get the Special Edition you should enjoy his interview where he talks like the Banzai Institute is real and ""Buckaroo"" is real and rather reclusive, etc...(actually in the commentary with Pepe Serna this ""inside joke"" that Buckaroo and his Hong Kong Cavaliers are ""real"" gets a little tiresome), but it all makes for a rather bizarre commentary that fits this uniquely funny sci-fi movie that is rather hip in its 'tude anyways.  (By the way the rocket car in first scene did really have a jet-rocket engine and traversed the desert landscape at 200 MPH!)
With all the bonus features the movie does make more sense right down to the Jamie Lee Curtis (as Buckaroo's mom) home movie sequence, as well as all the main characters given a ""biography""; and there is much talk (in 2000 or 2001) of a sequel (or tv show) with the ""know"" that certain characters would be brought back and another would be killed!  Right down to HOW person would be killed off!
And when I saw the Bonus Feature of Album Covers(!) for the Hong Kong Cavaliers complete with play list(!) I, personally, was thoroughly entertained.  5 well designed album covers/with titles; and one 10 song set titled Live at Artie's Artery (the place  ""Buckaroo and Hong Kong Cavaliers"" are playing when Buckaroo stops to ask ""Is someone not happy...?"" and meets/sees his ex-wife's twin sister  - who he did not know existed - scene...)
But, get this one if considering.  I spent $20 on this without a single regret.  Buckaroo is a rare breed indeed.  Part rebel/neurosurgeon/physicist/musician all rolled into 1 original package.  Or - as director W.D Richter points out in bonus feature - ""Buckaroo is a combination of DaVinci, Einstein, and Adam Ant!""  Adam Ant!?  Yes, this sure was an 80's movie!
Oh, and by the way, there might never have been a Flux Capacitor (Back to the Future) if not for Buckaroo Banzai's Oscillation Over Thruster.  Might be worth thinking about.",1461024000,5,2370,4.84863523573201

However, if you're renting or purchasing digitally from Amazon video, AVOID the SD version at all costs. Pay the extra dollars for HD.

Admittedly, the original film was shot on a low budget, but the SD version of Buckaroo Banzai is the worst digital transfer I've ever seen on Amazon video.

1386211,5,B000050NS2,"Well, there are over 200 other five-star reviews here, so I can only really add one thing...

This film is a cult classic for a reason - if there had been no Buckaroo Banzai, there would probably never have been a Firefly, The Avengers, Galaxy Quest or Guardians of the Galaxy.  I realize this is a bold statement but this was truly a seminal moment in science-fiction filmmaking, because the humor (particularly the snappy repartee between the characters) was paramount above everything else, including the crazy-silly plot.  Which is its own kind of comedy, truthfully.

I love everything about this film, but the actors in particular deserve a shout out.  John Lithgow and Christopher Lloyd, as the alien leader and one of his cronies, are hysterically over-the-top.  Jeff Goldblum is the perfect brainy nebbish.  Clancy Brown brings some sexy western swagger. And of course, Peter Weller, in his prime, is utterly radiant and his chemistry with Ellen Barkin, as a wacky goofball-in-distress, is red hot.  The supporting cast, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, the aliens and the conservative politicos are all spot on.

Peter Weller was, as usual, effective though so low-key you couldn't say he was great(witness his turn as Robocop).  John Lithgow, on the other hand, was way over the top as a foreign agent, while Ellen Barkin was wonderful as the love interest.
The plot was so complex that it's impossible to fully state here.  Suffice it to say, Buckaroo has a rock band(which leads him to Ms. Barkin) while also testing the nature of our existence (extra-dimensional travel, time shifting) on the side. During the course of the film, we see groupies, outer space aliens, extradimensional 'creatures', and some people acting really weird.

It has lots of action and some romance that are fun but when John Lithgow appears as the alien-possessed Italian scientist the hilarity starts. He not only steals the movie but also the audience, the dogs and the spiders. When he takes his shoes off--well I don't want to spoil the movie for you.

This is considered a cult film but isn't some intellectual, complex drama; it falls into the comedies group that include The Rocky Horror Picture show--very sexy, the Repo Man--sly and counterculture, Beetlejuice--Tim Burton's macabre humor, and the totally black comedy, Falling Down.

This movie is worth watching for Lithgow' performance alone. Christopher Lloyd has a part but unfortunately he is hidden behind a mask that limits his abilities.",1408060800,,882,5.160839160839161

To start with, anyone who is anyone is in this movie.  Jeff Goldblum is in this movie with an important supporting role that almost plays like a minor, inconsequential part.  John Lithgow has a prominent role in this movie as the largest ham you have ever lain eyes on--no surprise there.  Christopher Lloyd has a minor but critical support role.  Some of the people who are too insignificant to make the abridged cast list are huge.

The plot is so ungodly over-the-top, and the characters are built to match.  Buckaroo Banzai is a half-Japanese white man with multiple Ph. Ds or jobs or something, everything from brain surgery to building an inter-dimensional car that can go through walls.  Again, the main bad guy is a large ham in a world filled with large hams.

The first scene introduces us to Buckaroo Banzai, brilliant neurosurgeon and particle physicist, deep into experimental surgery, and which he concludes with his usual bravado and inimitable style...  We learn that life of late has however been rather tough on Banzai, what with the loss of his young wife.  Though now, with his invention of the oscillation overthruster, a device designed to open doors to the higher dimensions, matters are again beginning to look up for the brilliant scientist and martial arts expert.  So then, in the second scene, we see Buckaroo testing out his new device on the salt flats of Utah, with U. S. government officials dutifully close on his tail, monitoring progress.  ""He's fast; I'll give Banzai that.  But one heat seeking missile and he's history."" ...  But the experiment apparently has consequences that for some reason transcend the Earth, as we discover we are not the only inhabitants of the solar system.  So the story unfolds from here, with the results and consequences of this test run by Banzai... With aliens threatening an invasion from higher dimensions, and through the third, and with Russia on the trigger, should we be worried?  No, not at all. Not while Banzai is in the mix, and still alive.  Has he ever let us down?

John Lithgow plays a deranged scientist who breaks out of a mental asylum with aliens from another dimension. This film is high camp and silly. Silly in an enjoyable way that could only have come out in the early 1980's. The film has an infectious quality with the use of music and the coolness of the characters.

It's somewhat difficult to say what makes this film unique. Is it the quirky ensemble mini music video during the closing credits? Is it the tongue-in-cheek presentation of sci-fi? There have been some forgettable movies attempting to meld science fiction with comedy, but Buckaroo B. is absolutely not forgettable. Remarkably, the film provides more laughs during subsequent viewings, probably because the first viewing results in sheer bewilderment.
Flaws: Ellen Barkin did fine in her role, but her character was the antithesis of Princess Leia and unfortunately the Banzai troupe is strictly a boys club. Honestly I can't think of any other flaws at the moment. However, it IS a bad film if you take it seriously, or if subtlety is lost on you.

The Electroids of the 10th dimension threaten that if Buckaroo doesn't stop him, then they will have no choice but to destroy Earth by triggering WWIII.

A bunch of characters (the Hong Kong Cavaliers) led by a genius/rock musician (Buckaroo Banzai) fight against aliens from the eighth dimension (who sound like they are Jamaican). The thing is, we the viewers are supposed to know who these characters are and I confess, having seen this in the theater when it was released, I had NO idea who they were talking about. The plot was barely convincing and some of the actors seemed to be just playing along.

I read a few reviews before checking it out to see what this film was all about, because my friend's description left me confused.  The knock on this film, in fact, seems to be that it is hard to follow.  So when I sat down to watch I made sure to turn my attention up full throttle.

This film does go by at a breakneck pace and occasionally I had to stop and rewind a scene or two but honestly it wasn't really all that confusing after I just accepted that the plot was going to be pretty zany.  Everything is explained within the movie (which is more than can be said about some more recent films in the Sci Fi genre -- Star Wars prequels, I'm looking at you).  It all ties up by the end.  The fun part is getting there. This is one of those experiences that is definitely more about the journey than the destination.  It's what you get when you put James Bond, Mel Brooks, MacGyver and Dr. Strangelove in a blender.  Banzai himself is a mish-mosh of things, a true renaissance-man-superhero who is as talented a surgeon as he is a rock n roller.  This multidimensional hero creates a lot of the humor, as he is constantly revealing a new facet to his knowledge and abilities.  He's surrounded by a group of goofball sidekicks, each with their own gimmick (and each a talented musician).  The villains are hilarious, a group of dopey aliens under the rule of the alien-possessed Dr. Lizardo (John Lithgow, in what might be his funniest role).  There is also an off-kilter love story (generating some funny scenes) and enough hilarious asides to satisfy any habitual movie quoter for years to come.  Plus there is plenty of cold-war-era political satire which, although now very dated, still can elicit a chuckle for those of us old enough to remember those years.  Basically there is so much going on here that it might take a few viewings to absorb and process it all.

Which for me is the mark of a brilliant comedy.  This is quickly becoming a new favorite for me, and I recommend anyone to give it a try.",1308528000,,2107,4.417098445595855

When Buckaroo discovers that aliens from another dimension are infiltrating our world, he and his intrepid band of engineers and scientists go on the job to investigate and correct the dangerous situation. The word ""band"" is not used lightly. In addition to their work beyond the frontiers of known science, they are also a music band with raving fans and groupies.

However, I am not used to suspension of all neural activity, which watching this movie requires.

Jeff Goldblum must have really needed the money to dress up like one of the Village People.

Note to the producers: endless jargon does not science fiction make. Good science fiction has good plotting and characters you can like. You might also want to pay a bit of attention to continuity. A movie this confusing is not interesting, just annoying. If you want to see a confusing movie that is intertesting, try ""The Big Sleep"" with Bogart and Bacall. Of course, William Faulkner and Leigh Brackett were not available to write ""Buckaroo Banzai,"" so I guess you had to settle for whoever showed up for work that morning.

Another note to the producers: High-powered rifles and Colt .45 revolvers do not sound like firecrackers when fired.

1386341,5,B000050NS2,"'Buckaroo Banzai' is a cult film, and with good reason. In spite of cheap and cheesy special effects it is very entertaining. In fact, the cheapness and cheesiness contribute greatly to the overall effect and create a comic book world, with a great action hero, Buckaroo, who is quite the Renaissance Man: doctor, inventor, speed racer, martial artist, rock star, who is battling aliens from another dimension to save our planet. Ensuring its place in the cult film cannon, it presents this preposterous premise with the proper wit, camp, parody, and panache it so richly deserves.

---------------------
Lord John Whorfin: May I pass along my congratulations for your great interdimensional breakthrough. I am sure, in the miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly enshrined.
==========================

Peter Weller, who plays Buckaroo Banzai, is quite a Renaissance Man himself. In the film he leads a band called the Hong Kong Cavaliers. He caps off his electric guitar solo with a piccolo trumpet solo. In real life, he plays trumpet in a jazz band with Jeff Goldblum, who played New Jersey, the newest member of the Hong Kong Caviliers in the film. Peter Weller holds a master's degree in Roman and Renaissance art and is working toward a Ph. D. He teaches at Syracuse University. He was Robocop in the first two, but not the third, Robocop movies. He couldn't do the last sequel due to a prior commitment to ""Naked Lunch."" [Let's do ""Naked Lunch."" I'll have my people call your people.] In ""Mighty Aphrodite"" he plays Jerry Bender, who is another Renaissance Man who is seducing Lenny Weinrib's (Woody Allen) wife, Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter). Peter Weller was the perfect actor to portray Buckaroo Banzai, who was not only all of the previously mentioned things, but also a philosopher:

-----------------------
Buckaroo Banzai: Hey, hey, hey, hey-now. Don't be mean; we don't have to be mean, cuz, remember, no matter where you go, there you are.
=================================

Jeff Goldblum really shines as New Jersey, a doctor who works with Buckaroo and is asked to join the Hong Kong Caviliers. He shows up for what he thinks is the audition dressed in a red cowboy suit. Goldblum's offbeat humor is really perfect for the Cavaliers, who haze the newcomer and rib him about his outfit. Soon he is off on their latest adventure: saving the world from aliens from another dimension:

--------------------------------
New Jersey: Why is there a watermelon there?
Reno: I'll tell you later.
======================================

John Lithgow is totally over the top, and loving every minute of it, as the criminally insane Dr. Emilio Lizardo, alias Lord John Whorfin.

-------------------------
Lord John Whorfin: Home... home is where you wear your hat... I feel so breakup, I wanna go home.
===============================

Christopher Lloyd is instantly recognizable even though he plays alien John Bigboote behind a cheap and cheesy rubber mask. How is that pronounced? ""BigbooTAY!"" he keeps repeating, to no avail. [screaming] ""BIG-BOO-TAY! TAY! TAY!""

Dan Hedaya, Vincent Schiavelli, and Clancy Brown are just of few of the talented character actors who add so much to the festivities.

Bottom line is Buckaroo Banzai is a unique film that has to be seen to be believed -- and enjoyed. It has built up a richly deserved cult audience, and I heartily recommend it to fans of bizarre, and funny -- if you have a weird sense of humor -- films.

I was very happy however that a label was put on the outside warning me not to open unless I was sure that my DVD player could actually Play DVDs from Zone 2 - who knew? Alas, mine could not and I emailed and received direction on how to return the DVD. I did that and have yet to receive a refund but I am patient.

1386345,5,B000050NS2,"Out of all the films I saw as a kid, Buckaroo Banzai is one of the ones that has this aspect to it.  When I first saw it I didn't love it, probably because of this.  There was more there than I could process as an 8 year-old, but as the years went on and I revisited the film I got more and more out of it.  It's actually very similar to the Big Lebowski in that on the one hand it's a simple action movie, one of a million in the 80s, that deals with the threat of an alien invasion thwarted by a small band of unlikely humans at the last possible moment.  Yet the cast of characters is amazingly rich and the plot is, like Lebowski, unnecessarily complex and weird to a point where it all becomes much more than the sum of its parts.

I want to say that I first saw this film on HBO during the day on either a summer vacation or a weekend sometime in the mid-eighties, and like I said sort of dismissed it.  Later on I would keep coming back to it because of the actors, a lot of which went on to star in other movies I loved (Peter Weller in Robocop, John Lithgow in Harry and the Hendersons, Jeff Goldbum in The Fly, Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future).  I also love the unexplained ""I just started reading in the middle of this comic book"" feel the film has.  All the unanswered questions.  Who is this infamous World Crime League?  Why is Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith) so perfect?  Who is Peggy Priddy, twin sister of Penny Priddy, and Buckaroo's first wife who was murdered?  Why does New Jersey (Goldblum) have such an affinity for woolly chaps and 50s era cowboy clothing?  Etc., etc., etc.  In fact, in the film itself Buckaroo and his team, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, are stars of their own Marvel comic book, which was also released in real life by Marvel.

Add to this the dry delivery by Peter Weller of some really obtuse yet hilarious lines such as: ""Hey, hey, hey.  Don't be mean.  We don't have to be mean because, remember, no matter where you go, there you are.""

There are also a lot of little touches everywhere that make the film really fun to watch.  How they manage to tie in the original invasion of the Lectroids to the 1938 Orson Welles broadcast of War of the Worlds is genius.  I also love that the character names are silly and funny, breaking the unspoken rule of comedy of no funny names and still managing to pull it off.  I mean Buckaroo Banzai?  Penny Priddy?  All the Lectroids being named John something or other (Christopher Lloyd's Bigboote is a standout.)  Tie this together with insanely esoteric concepts like an 8th dimension that allows solid matter to travel through other solid matter, yet also serves as a gateway to either a parallel universe or as a worm hole to another galaxy, and you have a very rich and fun film that manages to mix action, comedy, and pulp nostalgia into one giant roller coaster ride.

I really do love this film, right down to its dated special effects (some much more effective than today's CGI nightmares leaking off the big screen) and corny dialogue.  I love this film because it's intentional and crafted to be exactly what it is.  I think the scene that sums this up the best is the end sequence, a wacky dance/walking montage set to some awesome 80s synth music that finds all of the characters in the film (except the bad guys I think, but including those who have died) dynamically joining up at a concrete drainage area to just, well, walk dynamically.  It really is a beautifully shot scene with plenty of fun zooms, twists and turns that is so upbeat, yet so serious it's almost mind numbing.  Wes Anderson made an homage to this sequence in The Life Aquatic at the end when all the crew members and characters meet up and walk to the ship.",1244678400,2,3727,4.353111432706223
1386346,5,B000050NS2,"Yes, it's half a campy film but also half a 1980s classic.

This movie has all you could want from a cult classic - from the campy special effects to the great dialogue ""It's bivouac man, they sleep here"" This movie is simply a lot of fun. As such - you definitely cannot take it too seriously or you will be disappointed. John Lithgow puts in a superb performance as well.

1386351,5,B000050NS2,"Once upon a time ...  there was a neurosurgeon who was also a rock & roller, and his wife died, or did she just leave?  Not sure that really matters because he can drive through solid rock, except that it's really not solid, it's actually another dimension, or maybe not.

Confused?  Not surprising.  You may be just as confused the first time you watch Buckaroo Bonzai.  You may need to watch it a few times to catch it all. You see, it's a bit like a cross between a screwball comedy from the 40's and a Woody Allen film. Half the time you can't keep up and the other half you don't understand what's going on.  But, and this is a big but or bute' (inside joke), it is well worth watching, as many times as it takes to get it, all of it.  Every bizarre detail.

I first saw it in the mid 80's on cable.  My daughter, who was about 5 got it very quickly and thought it was a hoot.  She went around playing Buckaroo games for days and  I finally had to hide the hammer and explain to her that it was make believe and that there really were no aliens in the rocks in the yard.  She still loves to watch it twenty years later and I have to admit to a certain fondness for Buckaroo and the Hong Kong Cavaliers which is why I recently bought two DVDs - one for each of us.

It's fun to watch, with or without popcorn.  I'm not sure which part I like the best -  John Lithgow as a maniacal dictator or Jeff Goldblum in fuzzy chaps.  It's a quandary.  It's a fast paced thrill ride into an imaginary world inhabited by ordinary people doing extraordinary things with surreality.  You'll love it!

It has moments - isolated performances such as John Lithgow's speech to the other aliens - that are pretty funny, but as a film it is a completely disjointed mess.  There are many scenes that don't seem to connect to anything.  The editors could just have easily shuffled the scenes and put them together in random order since it doesn't make any difference (and maybe they did).  And could the acting have been more non-existent?  No Mabel, it couldn't!  Instead of getting well known actors it would have been easier for the film makers to wander around town until they found and recruited a local garage band.  If you want to see a really bad sci-fi film that is funny in spite of its' awfulness have a look at Zardoz.  If you really need Buckaroo Bonzai do yourself a favor and just get a movie poster - it will be less painful.",1209254400,7,953,4.344632768361582
1386357,3,B000050NS2,"Really, this movie is quite typical of what you'd expect in a sci-fi movie.  Two scientists attempt to discover a way to travel inside of things based on the premise that atoms of matter are composed of mostly empty space.  The scientist played by John Lithgow succeeds only partially, and the results of his experiment leave him in a nutty mental state.  The other scientist later teams up with Buckaroo Banzai, and Buckaroo is the first guy ever to pass through a solid mountain by entering what I assume to be the 8th dimension.

Buckaroo is really the most likeable character in the movie.  He never loses his cool and he can pretty much do anything.  Unlike Neil Connery in Operation Double 007, Peter Weller makes this role somewhat believable.

Anyway John Lithgow finds out Buckaroo's experiment has succeeded completely, so he breaks out of the mental asylum to try to get his hands on some of Buckaroo's technological stuff that will finally allow him access into the 8th dimension.  And we find out that the reason he wants to get there so bad is his body has been taken over by one of the alien beings from that dimension, and this alien wants to go home.  Lithgow gives a terrific quotable speech when he's just on the verge of accomplishing this long awaited task.

But of course, he's foiled by that darn Buckaroo Banzai.  A few good aliens from the 8th dimension warn Buckaroo that stopping John Lithgow is imperative or some kind of physical explosion will happen that will cause nations of the world to lose their cool and go to war with one another, destroying the entire planet.  It's all very scientific.  Buckaroo heeds their advice, gets help from an alien disguied as a Jamaician, and the world is saved.

This is like a heavily sci-fi movie with just a few eccentricities thrown in sporatically here and there.  I figured it would have a LOT more eccentricities, but it's mostly just your typical, somewhat mediocre, sci-fi movie.  Aside from the character names, the Buckaroo Banzai comic, Jeff Goldblum's cowboy costume, and the whole rock band image, there really aren't any eccentricities in this film.

Honestly, I'm not a big fan of sci-fi movies, which explains most of my disappointment, but I love the old 80's style music, and Buckaroo Banzai and his band are just plain cool.  Even though I don't care for their movie all that much, I'll probably promote the characters themselves till my dying day.  Buckaroo Banzai rules!",1208563200,,2459,4.757075471698113
1386358,5,B000050NS2,"I saw this movie in its original theatrical run. I remember liking it inmensely. I have not seen it since, and bought the DVD since it has a lot of extras. No dissapoinments here. The film still works for me, and the extras (WARNING-SPOILER AHEAD) continues in the same humorous vein, so if you get the humour, you will have hours of entertainment. And here is the key: reading other reviews I found out a lot of viewers don't get the humour. There is no way to explain what tickles some people over others. It does not make a film bad (as they say), but unique and different to the normal ""satires"" out there. So open your mind, go back to those years (it helps in understanding the humour) and have a blast.

The quality of the image and sound is very good. The extras are a blast (as I said-it continues in the vein of the movie), and it gives you a lot of behind the scenes information. It is a shame that the work print has dissapeared, since the quality of the added scenes in the extras is not very good (source is video), but it's better than nothing. Could not test the NUON features since I don't have a player that supports it.

1386360,4,B000050NS2,"Here's a movie straight from the school of ""they don't make them like this anymore"".  It's a comic book/pulp novel/Saturday morning cartoon put on film.  In a very general sense the plot is rather simple:  Aliens are out to destroy the Earth and only Buckaroo Banzai can stop them.  Make no mistake about it though, it's something you need to watch more than once to get the gist of it.  Even though this is the only BB film, it flows as though it could be the second or third film in a series of BB films.  It hurls you straight into the action from the getgo and never lets up.  This makes the movie seem longer than it actually is, and it's not a terribly short film to begin with.  The character of Buckaroo Banzai is shoved in your face without any real concrete explanation of just who he is(the alternate intro clears that up a tad).  You do learn as the film goes on however as you ride out the craziness with him.  The first twenty minutes has him performing brain surgery, then suddenly he's test driving an experimental vehicle across the desert where he drives into another dimension(and gets a brain stuck to the undercarriage of his vehicle), and then he's in a nightclub performing a show with his rock band!  If this is the first time you've seen it, you're asking yourself, ""just what the hell am I watching?"".  I feel sorry for the poor SOB who comes in during the middle of the film!  The film never lets up however, and you're bombarded with every sort of craziness there is, as Buckaroo and his entourage of scientists/musicians/action heroes race around to stop the invading aliens, all of whom are named ""John""(they include Christopher Lloyd, Dan Hedaya, and John Lithgow).  After repeated viewings you will find that you undertsand more and more of what's going on, and who is who.  You'll also get more jokes that slipped past you before.  Needless to say that this movie will only appeal to a select group of people, and others will think it's just plain dumb and way too much insanity to handle.  A ""cult"" film if there ever was one.  The movie was obviously supposed to be the start of a series of films, but that never happened(probably coz it wasn't well received for the aforementioned reasons).  At least this one exists and is readily available for you to enjoy.  I seriously cannot even fathom Hollywood trying to make a movie like this now, at least not in the same style.  Definitely a more comic-like feel than any of the so called ""comic"" movies that have come out in recent years.  If you have a taste for the weird and just flat out fun, DO NOT let this pass you by.",1196208000,,2606,4.476694915254237
1386361,4,B000050NS2,"No science fiction collection is complete without this movie, in particular no camp-sci fi collection is complete without this quirky, strange little movie.  It is influential enough to have earned a nod in the buffy spin-off Angel;  Yoyodine Labs is one of Wolfram and Hart's clients.  Buckaroo Banzai is a modernized send-up of the old Doc Savage pulp novels.  Buckaroo is a half-Japanese, half-Texan super-genius whose parents died in a trans-dimensional accident in 1936.  Banzai is a cross of Dr. Schweitzer, Rambo, Bruce Lee, Stephen Hawkings, Bill Gates and Huey Lewis.

The cast is a surprising A and B+ list group including Peter Weller, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, and John Lithgow.  The actors are clearly having fun, and that is communicated to the screen.  Lithgow in particular steals the show.  The film successfully combines humor, a fast pace and general weirdness.  There is a watermelon in a vise in the Banzai Labs.  The aliens are all named ""John.""  One alien dies in a trip and fall accident.  The President is in traction.  All in all the film is a definite popcorn-munching fun film.

Now for the tough love.  The film has some deep flaws.  This is not really the first episode, like Star Wars: A New Hope was really Episode IV.  Buckaroo and his team: Reno Nevada, Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Pecos, Pinky Caruthers, etc. are all presumed to be household names. You are supposed to be disappointed when you hear that Pecos is not going to be in the film.  These people are intended to be familiar from comics, movies, novels, TV adaptations, etc.  This is a big episode in the nonexistent series.  It is the one where Buckaroo meets Penny Priddy, where New Jersey joins the team and where some old friends die.  Since there were no other episodes, the fact that Penny looks just like Buckaroo's dead wife Peggy, who was murdered on their wedding night in a hotel room by Hanoi Xan with a cyanide bomb, (take that Clue) is meaningless.  When an old friend dies there just isn't the impact as if you did know the character.  Since this is not the first episode, the writers decided to pretend that you know who these people are.  When this is combined with the frenetic pace of the film and the oddball elements, the characters just kind of fade out.  Only the villains and Perfect Tommy really shine.

Another problem lies in some of the action, in particular the ten-year-old who accompanies Buckaroo on the Yoyodine raid.  There might be some backlash today to a kid with an M-16 running around, shooting aliens, even if he is a Blue Blaze Irregular.  This might bring up gang issues etc.

As to the extras, on the disk, they are a pretty good set.  In particular one scene from the deleted scenes really deserved to be in the movie.  Penny Priddy, drunk, desperate and depressed has wandered into a bar where Buckaroo is playing.  When he talks to her she gives a speech about how bad off she is.  She says ""It's like the guy at the unemployment office said: ""Honey, as long as there is a sidewalk you'll have a job.""  Seriously funny.

I hope, with the recent talk of a TV series and one of the major obstacles to the film having passed on to another dimension (check out the gossip about the film) that the writers take some of these criticisms seriously.  I almost loved your film, I hope that whatever form it takes in the future is...better.  By the way, the reason there was no sequel or TV series was not due to panning or low box office receipts, but due to behind the scenes nastiness and politics.",1195776000,2,3550,4.63884430176565

The movie focuses on the (further) adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, scientist, neurosurgeon, rocker, protector of the world.  He has his collection of memorable characters around him, the hard-rocking scientists and adventurers known as the Hong Kong Cavaliers.  The action and dialogue and characters are camped up, and eveyone is having a good time harkening back to the serials of old with a modern flavor.  Pay close attention, or you'll miss some of the fun in the movie (for example, a droning in the background of the mental hospital that lithium will no longer be available on credit).  For no apparent reason, John Litgow goes into a cheesy italian accent free assocation on the word ""home,"" finishing with a Beach Boys quote:  ""I feel so broke up, I want to go home.""  Jeff Goldblum asks why there's a watermelon attached to a big, scary-looking machine.  He's promised he'll be told later but of course never is.  We're left to smile and wonder.  Of course there's the classic lines such as, ""No matter where you go, there you are,"" and Perfect Tommy coming to the defense of Mr. Wizard as a top scientist.  You never know when a line is coming.  While performing neurosurgery, Banzai says ""No, don't tug on that.  You never know what it might be attached to.""  Ellen Barkin has several fine moments and was perfect as the female lead.  For me, the social message (if there is one) came from my son, who watched it with me and said ""it's really cool to be that smart.""  The scientist is also a rock star and action hero.  Being Banzai or one of his adventurers is all that any kid could ever hope to be, and the movie is just plain escapist fun for the people who get it.

1386383,5,B000050NS2,"This is totally a cult movie, so if you're into straightforward, clearly painted storylines and conventional  scripts, I suggest this is not your film. This would be more for the appreciators of Monty Python or anything sort of avant-gard, although I must say it bears no resemblance to any of the Pythons - it just takes itself no more seriously than any of those movies. Years ago I was weekend projectionist for a neat little art-house theatre in northern Vermont, and showed this movie. The house was very evenly split down the middle between the ""get-its"" and the ""don't-get-its""; one side was practically rolling on the floor from all the ""in"" jokes and the other side sat stone-faced, completely in the dark. After purchasing a dvd of it not too long ago, I discovered there really was more to it, and W.D. Richter apparently harboured ambitions to develop a minor franchise of Buckaroo Banzai - in the special features we learn about a diabolical megalomaniac who has it in for everything Banzai - but this was news to me, twenty-plus years after becoming a Banzai-ite. At any rate, also in the special features a good number of the cast is quizzed on what it's all about, and the consensus is - nobody knows. More to the point, nobody really seems to care. This is a movie to just enjoy without trying to make too much sense of it. Certainly everybody concerned seems to have abdicated investigation and are all just having a hell of a good time. John Lithgow, as the evil John Whorfin, has occupied the body of 40s forward-thinking scientist and specialist in particle physics, Dr. Emilio Lizardo. The occupation has driven the good Dr. Lizardo mad, and when the movie commences, he is residing at a hospital for the criminally insane in New Jersey. Our hero, Buckaroo Banzai (played with commendable restraint by Peter Weller, who still looks at times as though he can barely contain himself)has just gone through a mountain in Nevada with his jet car, aided by his Oscillation Overthruster, and has become the darling of the entire U.S. population. Dr. Lizardo, watching this breakthrough on TV in the insane asylum, breaks out of the place with remarkably little resistance to find the Overthruster and reassemble his team so that they can blast back to the Eighth Dimension where they came from. (I never said it would be easy to synopsize.) So much goes on in this - Dr. Lizardo's bunch, the Red Lectroids, are the bad guys and, to further complicate things, are all named John, and the good guys - chasing them in spaceships that look like big seashells - are a bunch of apparent Rastafarians called Black Lectroids. Come to think of it, they're all named John too, including the women. Buckaroo and his band - quite literally a band, they play rock-and-roll gigs when they're not saving the world - the Hong Kong Cavaliers (honestly, I'm not making any of this stuff up) are recruited to oust the Red Lectroids from Earth or else -or the Black Lectroids will take serious steps. It gets more and more involved - in the way of cult movies, multiple viewings will give a much clearer overview - but some schtick that is howlingly funny is easily overlooked because of the amount of business happening. At one point in the insane asylum, Dr. Lizardo is sorting through a mountain of debris in his room - don't miss the butterfly net that falls by his bed - while an ethereal, airport-announcer female voice announces over the loudspeaker, ""Lithium is no longer available on credit."" One of the other inmates is playing a Buckaroo Banzai pinball machine. Two hunters in another section of the movie find a Buckaroo Banzai comic book in the weeds. I have never really found anybody, other than the two guys who introduced me to the movie, who quite got what I did from this movie, but if you're willing to suspend your disbelief totally and just roll with what happens, you will probably enjoy it. At least cut it some slack for all the wonderfully over-the-top performances - it's quite clear that the cast is having a whopping good time.",1152576000,3,4051,4.7136812411847675

In fact, I think multiple scenes in the The Life Aquatic (the team marching at the end anyone?) were heavily influenced by this bizzare movie. Admittedly this movie isn't perfect. John Lithgow sometimes really stinks it up with his hammy comedy and there are some dead areas in terms of pacing, but overall it's worth your dollar.

1386388,5,B000050NS2,"This movie. like the ReBoot TV show, was officially done down by the powers that be, but became an absolutely critical fave among viewers. Panned by critics, it had an abysmal track record in its short box office run. However, its marketing program was a textbook case of how not to do PR, and a great ""B"" movie like this could not fly under the radar long. Fans have made it an all-time cult classic (as the hundreds of reviews here attest). I can add nothing to the insightful and detailed reviews here, and so merely give my reasons why this is my all-time favorite movie (I've seen it more than twenty times).

I began by vowing never to see this movie, based on the bad posters and ridiculous taglines. The very idea was overreaching: a rock star cum physicist plus martial arts expert and brilliant surgeon as well as comic book hero who--duh!--saves the world. Absolutely to be avoided. I was nevertheless pursuaded to see it at a special showing with a group of college friends. Never has a film been more wrongly marketed.

To start with: the test market showings were in the South. Nothing wrong with that. That's where Cartoon Network is which has the smartest audience and best writers in TV bar none. Having said that, it's still possible to get these things wrong. The Grand Ole Opry might not be the best place for a Chuck Berry revival (but it might, for all I know). Regardless, this film rated dismally with its test audience. Next time launch it in the northwest, where it's rainy and people read all the time.

Next, the only thing as dense as this movie is a Charles Williams novel. I don't think you can get even a glimpse of this film in one showing. It's so brilliant not only in its many send-ups (like Rocky Horror, as one reviewer pointed out) but also in the details interwoven, comic book style into the plot such as it is, that it repays a few hundred midnight matinee showings. Ellen Barkin is absolutely fabulous. Peter Weller actually plays sax and the music is mesmerizing. A lot of movies have stolen from this one which, flying under the radar, remains unsung. The rest of the cast is also fantastic. Jeff Goldblum plays the role he always plays, but so much better than in Jurassic Park, The Fly, Earth Girls are Easy, etc. Perfect Tommy is well, perfect. With a built-in ""coming attraction"" blurb and more story possibilities than twelve Back to the Futures, this film's sequel is long overdue. As numerous reviews testify, the groundswell is reaching critical mass. We want Buckaroo and Team Banzai!",1140652800,8,2538,4.623059866962306
1386389,5,B000050NS2,"Team Banzai was positioned with this adventure ""across the 8th dimension"" to save the world over and over.  Unfortunately, this was the only movie.  20 years ago I paid to see it in the theater.  Twice.

Peter Weller was perfectly cast as ""Buckaroo Banzai,"" rockstar, neurosurgeon, savior of the world.  Together with his team of cowboy scientist warriors, they battle the forces of alien evil and - in the case of Buckaroo - even have time to rediscover love.

Some people hate this movie.  But ""Banzai"" fans who meet each other in a crowded room share a knowing look.  It's sort of like finding a fellow Freemason in the least likely place.  Anyway, even fans have to experience the movie over and over to make sure they've ""gotten"" all the subtleties.  And for those of us who always wondered about the ""watermelon,"" the director commentary provides that little nugget of information.

Many of the cast were relatively unknown back in 1984.  Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, Chris Lloyd, Ellen Barkin, etc. etc. have since gone on to other things, but for those who love the kooky dialogue and interesting mix of dead-pan and over-acting, this is a movie to enjoy for years to come.

Improve your sex life

Think and grow rich

Increase self-esteem

Enhance your creativity

Grow your intelligence

This film will teach you about

The secret of the Universe

The nature of God

How to make friends and even influence enemies

With such matters in the bargain I think I can say with great confidence that ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai"" is the greatest film of the 1980's.  More intelligent than ""The Maltese Falcon"", more sweeping than ""Gone With The Wind"", more sexy than ""Casa Blanca"" this film will completely restructure the way you see the world and feel in your inmost being.

There's a reason why people call it a cult classic.  It does things to the people who watch it.  Any young whipper-snapper worth his or her salt wants to grow up to be Buckaroo Bonzai or at least grow up to be a member of his Team.  Buckaroo is a shining role-model for the youth unlike the whacko politicians and religious leaders who will corrupt our youth into insanity or death.

Buckaroo is not a god only because a god would not be fit to kiss his feet or even untie his shoe-laces.  Buckaroo is the true successor of Bugs Bunny.  He, like the August Rabbit, is too anarchical to be an anarchist.  He doesn't have time to rebel he is so busy saving the world and reshaping the structures of all that we humans consider sexy and intelligent.

Did I fail to mention that this film is actually humorous?  But it is a humor born of a supreme freedom.  Nothing is safe in the universe from the soul and wit of Buckaroo Bonzai-ism which wreaks havoc with our sacred necessities.  All true lovers of freedom love 1. the music of Beethoven, 2. the antics of Bugs Bunny, 3. the fact that Elvis Presley shot his television, and, of course, 4. ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai"".

I don't know what fascists and fundamentalists everywhere were doing in the Eighties but I was contemplating Buckaroo Bonzai and plotting the destruction of civilization as we know it.  Bonzai had a great influence on the perverse but glorious mutations of my own brain and I owe a debt to him never to be re-paid.

This time, he's out to save the Earth from the Lectroids of Planet 10 across the eighth dimension. (Dimensions four through seven seem to have gone astray, but don't let that worry you.) Buckaroo is the only one who can see them as they really are, so it's his job to lead his men (girls not invited, apparently) on this mission against the Lectroids and their front company Yoyodyne. Along the way, he enlists Scooter, a small boy in the Buckaroo fan club, Scooter's father (with a helicopter conveniently at hand), and Penny Pretty. She's the token female, suitable for screaming, saving, and wearing of costumes that threaten structural failure at any moment.

This movie promised a sequel, one which seems never to have appeared. That's probably for the best. This movie had its own mad logic, but I'm not sure it would have withstood repetition.

It's a goofy cult classic, suitable for lots of popcorn and a late night when you don't want to worry about things making sense. It's a self-concious satire of a half-dozen adventure genres, but you don't have to worry about that too much. Just let it all wash over you.

It's not about a ""plot"" or ""characted development"" or any of that other stuff y'all are compalining about.  It is just for laughs, and was probably a bit ahead of its time.

Fast moving, energetic and a great cast, make this a classic. I've waited years for em to make a sequal, guess thats not gonna happen.

Peter Weller is excellent as Buckeroo and his mismatched band of followers are just as good. Too many good characters in this film to name 'em all.

1386399,5,B000050NS2,"The last time I watched this DVD, I was also reading the `Pinky Carruther's Unknown Facts' from the DVD special feature while the movie was playing.  For a movie that was made in 1984, a lot of details were interesting enough to try to comprehend as the movie continued to play in the background, but such extras will seem like an annoying distraction to anyone who has not seen this movie often enough to worry about numerous loose ends.  The relationship between the cast and the characters they play seems to be endlessly amusing to Pinky Carruther, but I enjoyed references to the pink cake box, as an item that was totally unexpected.  For those who vaguely remember the movie, but wonder what anyone else could possibly be thinking about, allow me to reveal that the greatest revelation for me was that each character from Planet Ten had the first name John because it sounded like a normal greeting in the language of Planet Ten.  Etiquette on Earth has become such a quaint cultural niche that having someone identified as John Ya-ya hardly seems polite, but names that were easier to figure out seemed even less polite.  As they never quite say, so there.

There are five big movie stars in this movie, people I recognize whenever I see them again, and it is usually a relief when each finally has a hit of his or her own.  Among the minor characters, I thought the Secretary of Defense was given a tremendous part.  Secrets are something special for me, and when the high speed jet car heads off toward a mountain after only eight minutes of the original theatrical version, the Secretary of Defense has the most dramatic line:  ""What the hell's Phase Two?""  At the news conference explaining travel in the 8th dimension, the Secretary of Defense is asked about the possibility of war in the 8th dimension even before anyone knows the red lectroids are in the room, trying to get the oscillation overthruster to return to Planet Ten.  I like all the twists and turns in the plot, particularly those which tie in so well to Orson Welles, the old guy in the wine commercial.  In the confrontation at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in famous Grover's Mill, New Jersey, Buckaroo Banzai is thinking no human being may have ever been in the place before, while the Secretary of Defense is looking for a bomber that Yoyodyne is supposed to be building, even if he has to go through a door that says SEKRIT.

I like the music, which does not predominate, but rouses me in the few moments when the characters are quiet enough for music to excite more interest in what is going to happen next.  I even like the original theatrical version opening more than the extended 5-year-old Buckaroo birthday party with Jamie Lee Curtis as Buckaroo's mom because the original gets to the main theme music so much quicker.  Story details that were cut from the original release don't excite me now because I associate most of my excitement with the versions that I saw on television after renting the video a few times.  I had to hear most of the jokes several times to remember them forever, but one look at the

DECLARATION OF WAR

The Short Form

should be enough to convince people that we have been pretty lucky so far.

This movie has an outstanding sequence filmed for the credits, and the music at the end of the film sums up the experience of people marching together with some odd hops like this movie heading straight into the camera before everybody disappears off to one side.  The clothes were incredible, too.",1094601600,7,3510,4.638126009693053

Peter Weller did this better than he did 'RoboCOP'. Jeff Goldblum is suave and funny in this feature, even more so than in 'Transylvania 6-5000' with Ed Begley, Jr. and Geena Davis. To V. Mejia: Calling this a boring film is the most absurd thing that I have ever heard since George Bush said 'Read my lips.'. You must have been watching a different film or the humor is just beyond you. It is hard to be funny when your audience doesn't understand little things like science and levity.

The folks at the School of The Americas could probably use this movie as part of their torture training program. John Lithgow's performance is excrutiating to watch. It's uncomfortably over the top.

Sure the plot makes no sense, but that's the point- once you realize that, you can basically enjoy the humor which is at certain points hillarious...
I first saw this movie when I was in around 8th grade back when it came out in 84 and while I didn't understand it back then either,  the highly original and unique special effects ideas (the creature stuck to the bottom of Buckaroo's car) and style stuck with me for a long time.
If you grew up in the 80's this makes for a funny flashback film in some ways. However, even with Perfect Tommy's Duran Duran style, Peter Weller's straight from '84 striped shirt, the way overdone music video-type ending sequence, and the totally 80's synthesizer soundtrack, this movie isn't just ""80's cheese"" by any means.

1386405,4,B000050NS2,"""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension""is a movie that is, as the filmmakers intended, hard to categorize; it's part comedy, part social satire, part bug-eyed alien flick, and part doomsday thriller.  It's such a hodgepodge that it deserves repeat viewings to get all the jokes, nuances, and confusing plot line.
The biggest smiles come from the puns at the expense of the alien ""John's"".  Christoher Lloyd's character's last name is a prime example of this technique.
The actors seemed to have had a ball in their respective roles.  Especially memorable are bits by John Lithgow as the demented Dr. Lizardo, Carl Lumbly as a quirky alien with a Rastafarian complex, Matt Clark as a representative of the military, the aforementioned Lloyd, Robert Ito as Dr. Nikita, and in a brief appearance, the late Rosalind Cash.
The extended opening sequence, offered on this DVD, features an uncredited Jamie Lee Curtis and provides some much needed background prior to the opening credits.
The film's frentic pace and off-the-wall sight gags/jokes might cause some confusion and slight discomfort, but it has its pluses.
After all these years, it would be interesting if, say a Tim Burton, decided to ""reimagine"" this film from 1984.
Now, that would be something!

The people who say this film is low budget, plotless, and generally a bad film are obviously over-Lucas-ized and can't get passed the 'Star Wars is the measuring stick of Sci-Fi' mentatility. This movie was designed to have a low-budget look. It's supposed to have a campy feel with stupid dialog. THAT'S THE POINT! It's a flashback to the Ed Wood era. Wondering why the alien ships look like sea shells? They are! They wanted a non-tech look.  No plot? Are you nuts, there's a clear plot. Some folks must have gone to the bathroom. This film stands the test of time... if you can laugh every time it's played, it's a good sign. This classic is not meant to be a big epic film and win an Oscar; it ain't the Godfather. It's fun, plain and simple. The stars shine, Ellen Barkin is unbelievably sexy, Jeff Goldblum is perfect as the new guy, Peter Weller plays the straight-man with flawless ease, and John Lithgow is a god.

1386413,1,B000050NS2,"After watching this film, I immediately knew I'd just witnessed one of the lowest points in motion picture history.  However, that in itself was understandable--after all, how many people can truly claim they've beyond a doubt seen one of the worst films ever made? Not to say Buckaroo Banzai was the only bad film I've watched--I've seen many terrible films which hollywood studios have passed off as real entertainment, including ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot.""
Buckaroo Banzai, at its best, made absolutely no sense, had no real point, no incredible action scenes to speak of--not much of anything.  But that's all okay.  There are many pointless, worthless films out there.
What struck me as inane about Buckaroo Banzai was this--it seems to have a large following.  Some strange ""cult"" film appeal, which apparently leads people hopelessly into the love of obscure and pointless things (some may prefer to call it ""existential,"" or ""experimental"") has led most of the reviews I've read of this piece of garbage to be praising.
In the special features section of this DVD, the director tried to pass of this ridiculous piece of mess off as a ""cult classic.""  Then he continued on to say that the lack of cohesion of his film was due to lack of funds.
This film simply had NO plot, NO developed characters, and NO sense!  A joke was made which played on the name of one of the characters, ""Perfect Tommy.""  However, nowhere earlier in the film had any understandable reference been made to this character as Perfect Tommy.  I did not understand the joke until I watched the special features in which the director explained it all--and even then, the joke was terrible.
There is NO excuse for bad filmmaking.  To create a [bad movie] and then tell audiences that you intended to make it that way is a petty excuse, and it's a shame anyone ever fell for it.  I suppose some director should come out of the woodwork and say that ""George of the Jungle"" was actually supposed to be a profound intellectual dialogue on idiotic filmmaking, or that ""Master of Disguise"" showcases Dana Carvey's genius at making himself look like an untalented, albeit sometimes mildly funny fool.

The outlandishness of the main character and the far out plot seem on paper to be too much, but director WD Richter and the excellent cast pull off one of the greatest feats (in my opinion) in cinema history: Making a movie that really does defy pigeonholing into any genre or category. It is a pulp comic book, serial adventure, sci-fi, action-comedy movie with a dose of romance thrown in. John Lithgow's over the top performance as Doctor Lizardo and Peter Weller's superb job as Buckaroo along with the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum and scene stealing steamy innocence of Ellen Barkin help make this a true classic and one of my favorite movies of all time. The closest movie I can compare it to is another one of my favorites, Big Trouble in Little China.
For those who have not seen the movie, Buckaroo Banzai is a world famous Neurosurgeon, rock star, comic book character, rocket car driver and scientist. He also has his own organization of boy-scout like groups called Blue Blazers. His band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, are a group of top scientists and all around good guys with very distinct personalities. Penny Pretty is the love interest of Buckaroo, who also happens to be his deceased wife's long lost twin sister. There is so much going on in this movie that I probably saw it three times before I totally understood the whole story. Which in a nutshell is: Black Lectoids = good. Red Lectoids = bad. Dr. Lizardo is a Red Lectoid. The Black Lectoids have discovered that arch criminal Dr. Lizardo is on the loose on planet Earth and they threaten to wipe out the entire planet to make sure that he does not escape. They give Buckaroo 24 hours to capture or kill him before they put their annihilation plan into place. With his band and a few others, Buckaroo infiltrates the hideout of Dr. Lizardo and manage to set things right. I really could go on for pages on details on the story and the plot, but you wouldn't believe me. There is no way anyone could have gotten so much into a 102 minute movie. And do you know what the most frustrating part is? At the end they display to be on the lookout for ""Buckaroo Banzai and the World Crime Syndicate"". They obviously had plans to make another film after this one made everyone rich and famous. When that didn't happen (at least from this movie) that meant that the sequel didn't happen. The screenplay has been written for years and now and again talk comes up that all of the main characters needed for a sequel are interested, but still nothing has come of it.
The disk is great with tons of extras including the segments ""Jet Car All Access"", ""Pinky Caruthers Unknown Facts"" and an alternate opening scene. There is another segment titled ""Buckaroo Banzai Declassified Documentary"" which is from the viewpoint that he is a real person. The writer and director also do a full length commentary and there are some other extras. Picture and sound quality are excellent. At around [X]this is one of the best buys going on dvd.

Buckaroo travels with the Hong Kong Cavaliers, a band of lab assistants/back-up musicians who are also really snazzy dressers. Buckaroo's inter-dimensional experiments with his Oscillation Overthruster (when attached to his rocket car Buckaroo can drive through mountains by way of another dimension) throw him straight into the middle of an alien war, and before you know it, he has just a few hours to save the world. A race of aliens called the Red Lectroids have been waiting for such an item to become a reality, as they need it to return to the distant planet they call home (their arrival on Earth was covered by Orson Wells, but was later covered up by convincing everyone that the radio broadcast was a work of fiction called ""The War of the Worlds""). One of Buckaroo's archenemies, Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), who has been possessed by the Red Lectroids when he attempted to create a similar device to the Oscillation Overthruster decades before, and has now escaped from an insane asylum, is back at work with the Lectroids on a plan to control the world. Throw in Rastafarian aliens, unscheduled travel between dimensions, and the odd inexplicable watermelon, and Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin), the twin sister of Buckaroo's late wife, and you get a film that is pure enjoyment with its fast pace, quotable dialogue, and barrage of gags (the Red Lectroids' leader (Christopher Lloyd) has chosen the unfortunate name of John Bigboote, and no matter how many times he tells people that it is pronounced ""Bigboo-t! T!,"" everybody calls him Big-Booty).

Confused? Hang on, that was only the first 10 minutes of the movie. Don't worry though; you won't be bored even when you're not sure what's going on. Buckaroo Banzai hurls you right into the middle of its comic-book universe and keeps going at a breakneck pace. It's chock-full of overlapping jokes (even as we're trying to make sense of Dr. Lizardo's hospital room, a voice calmly announces that ""lithium is no longer available on credit"" over the PA system), hilarious throwaway dialogue (""You're like Jerry Lewis: you give me hope to carry on.""), and weirdness just for the sheer joy of it (""Why is there a watermelon there?"" ""I'll tell you later.""). You'll want to watch it at least twice--there's just no way to catch everything the first time around. Ellen Barkin has a terrific time doing a dead-on film noir parody as Penny Priddy, and John Lithgow turns in a brilliant manic performance as Dr. Lizardo/John Whorfin.

OK, one is that they take up less room. Another is that you don't have to rewind them. (We are a nation of people who tell the microwave to hurry up.) But the biggest reason we love DVDs is
 FEATURES!
Despite the fact that this movie was made a long time ago, the creators of the film have loaded this DVD with fun features. There are cast and crew interviews, a slide show (put it on your computer and download those badges to your color printer!), a cute ""Easter egg"", schematics, and two tracks of add-on material. By that, I mean that there is a voiceover track you can pick where the director and one of the Hong Kong Cavaliers chat about backstory and the production of the movie. The other track is very silly subtitles, which also add backstory to the movie and explain some obscure references that some folks did not get. If you want to know about Hanoi Xan, for example, you need to see and hear these backstories.
If you really want to blow your mind, play it with the director commentary on audio *and* the subtitled backstory. While eating watermelon.
Now, if they only had recipes for Mrs. Johnson's fabulous baked goods.

1386492,5,B000050NS2,"Since the release of this film in 1984, it has achieved bona fide cult status, and with good reason; for it is, without question, one of the most unique offerings in the universe of cinematic science fiction.  chock-full of quirky, memorable characters and scenes, ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,"" directed by W.D. Richter, is laced with clever dialogue, action, adventure and surprises.  And where else are you ever going to find a main character who is a scientist, brain surgeon and rock n' roll star all rolled up into one?
 After years of research, Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) and his colleague, Professor Hikita (Robert Ito), have successfully developed an ""overthruster,"" a device that has allowed Buckaroo to pass through solid matter-- a mountain, in fact-- driving through it at high speed in his specially designed and equipped car.  But when his achievement hits the news, it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum, where he has been a resident for many years, ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.
 But though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed, it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm, one of whom-- Lord John Whorfin-- has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body.  They are Red Lectroids from Planet 10 by way of the 8th dimension, stranded on earth (in human form) and awaiting the development of the overthruster, which will enable them to return home.  These are dangerous and resourceful beings, and they are about to take Buckaroo Banzai-- currently on tour with his band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers-- by surprise.  And soon, all that will stand between the Red Lectroids and the destruction of the earth, will be Buckaroo, his band and some help from his loyal followers, the ""Blue Blazer Regulars.""
 Working from the highly imaginative, clever and detailed screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch, Richter has fashioned and delivered a colorful and exciting adventure filled with subtle humor, the unexpected and an array of outrageous characters, from Whorfin and the Lectroids (all of whom have the first name ""John""), to Buckaroo's cohorts like ""Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith)"" and New Jersey (Jeff Goldblum), to the alluring, mysterious woman Buckaroo encounters, Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin).  It's an unconventional, yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides, lines and situations, all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next.  He throws so much at you, in fact, that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through; but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings, because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be:  Pure entertainment from start to finish.
 Peter Weller is perfectly cast as Buckaroo, and he successfully captures all of the elements that make his character the ultimate Renaissance Man of the immediate future.  With this performance, Weller becomes the personification of the genius, adventurer and master-of-all-things; it's the definitive portrayal of a unique individual, quite unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before.  Weller's Buckaroo is intelligent and self-assured-- watching him you get the feeling there's always something going on in his head, and always a step ahead of the next guy-- and it's his ability to convey the complexities of the character that makes him believable, and his incredible exploits seem credible.  Simply put, Weller has taken a comic book character and made him real, and it makes the film work.
 As Lizardo/Whorfin, John Lithgow takes it magnificently over the top with a character that is something of a precursor to his High Commander Dick Solomon on TV's ""3rd Rock from the Sun.""  And watching this guy in action is a real kick.  He's larger than life, wildly animated and extroverted, while affecting an accent that's a veritable smorgasbord of dialect.  He lumbers along like a mutated Quasimodo, and when he gives a speech to his fellow Red Lectroids about going ""home,"" it's one of the most hilarious scenes you're ever going to see anywhere.  There's definitely a method to Lithgow's madness, and it's a terrific performance.
 Christopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids, ""John Bigboote,"" and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot (especially when Lizardo insists on calling him ""Big-Booty,"" and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced ""Bigboo-TAY!"").  And that's just an example of the many, many finer and detailed elements Richter uses to make this film so enjoyable and successful, from consistently funny verbal exchanges to broad physical humor, all interspersed with the action and woven seamlessly into the story.
 The additional supporting cast includes Rosalind Cash (John Emdall), Pepe Serna (Reno Nevada), Matt Clark (McKinley), Clancy Brown (Rawhide), Carl Lumbly (John Parker), Vincent Schiavelli (John O'Connor), Dan Hedaya (John Gomez), Bill Henderson (Casper), Damon Hines (Scooter), Billy Vera (Pinky Carruthers), Ronald Lacey (President Widmark) and William Traylor (General Catburd).  A film that will take you on a wild ride and into regions beyond the known, ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"" is that most rare treasure among cinematic discoveries:  A truly unique film.  It's enthralling and entertaining, and will keep you laughing and involved no matter how many times you see it.  And it's filled with great lines you'll be able to quote endlessly and use for any occasion.  Or, as Buckaroo himself would say, ""No matter where you go, there you are...""

I thought that it was clever and fast-moving and altogether a perfect Doc Savage analog for the Eighties.
I rewatched it for the first time in years over the weekend with my stepdaughter and a friend of hers (both of whom apparently enjoyed it as much as i did in '84) and discovered that while i may have been right about all of those qualities, there was a third quality that, as part of the group experience, i failed to notice the absence of -- and that was ""Substance"".
The pacing and the surface glitter serve to keep the mind from catching up with itself and the film on first viewing and asking plaintively of itself ""But *why*...?"" or going ""Wait a minute -- how...?"" (not unlike most Steven Spielberg films) or from examining the plot contrivances necessary to make the story ""work"".
Perfect Tommy's watermelon could be a metaphor for most of what happens in the film, in that respect -- ""Why a watermelon?""  ""Why not?""
The villainous Red Lectroids never manage to do anything but look more or less vaguely ridiculous, and why must the Good Guy Black Lectroids have Rasta dreadlocks and accents?  Do the spaceships remind anyone else of giant kidney stones?
Why are all Lectroids named ""John (something)""?  And why do some have comic-relief last names and some have perfectly ordinary last names?
Neatly nestled in the tissue-thin narrative, however, are a few goodies.  ""It's not my planet, monkey-boy!"" and ""Wherever you go, there you are"" have, quite properly, become catchphrases, and it's worth watching the whole film just to see John Lithgow's totally deranged performance as Dr Lizardo.

His genius and talents cause women to swoon, men to raise their beers in salute, and children giggle with glee. He's the hero everyone wants to be. This is the world this film throws you into.
The movie is successful on many absurd levels. However, it never quite reaches the level of either camp or sheer un-self-consciousness that it needs to become the cult classic it seems to want to be. On first viewing, you might find yourself wondering if you've missed the first installment of the Banzai trilogy - and you haven't. Earl Mac Rauch crafted a giddy homage to all the sci-fi serial characters of the 30s with a mix of 80s sensibility and a dash of Doc Savage and Our Man Flint. Peter Weller is fine, though the script doesn't really require much of him besides looking good in a suit and being able to speak well. Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, and particularly Clancy Brown and John Lithgow give fine performances without a single wink to the house.

I was initially quite excited about the large number of features on this disk but they turn out to be a detriment!  In a way, I wish I had never seen them.  The problem is that director Richter treats the material as though it's a dramatization of the real adventures of a real Buckaroo Banzai.  This is a far bigger problem than simply being annoying:  it eliminates the possibility of discussing some very interesting topics such as how he came up with the idea for Buckaroo, the struggles he's had with studios both in making the film and trying to create a franchise, and why it's such a cult classic.
But it's even worse than simply missing opportunities to provide meaningful stuff.  Richter gives lots of bogus information to play up the ""docudrama"" angle.  He tells us that all references to Hanoi Xan were removed because Buckaroo thought such a dastardly person shouldn't even be mentioned in a lighthearted movie.  In reality, the studio (wisely) ordered Richter to excise Xan, feeling that the plot was already a bit much.  Once you hear Richter's bogus explanation, you really don't know how much of what he tells you on the rest of the DVD is true!
Most of the ""deleted scenes"" are truly awful, including the overhyped Jamie Lee Curtis ""alternative intro"" scene.  The ""Pinky's 48 billion unknown facts"" is painful to watch.  And Richter gives you the impression of someone who still hasn't accepted the fact that the film only appeals to a very niche crowd.  I've lost a lot of respect for him.
Look, this is a classic movie and I'm glad I have it on DVD now.  But the opportunity to provide some valuable info about this legendary film has been utterly wasted.  What a shame.  If you do buy this disk (and I *am* recommending it -- barely), do yourself a favor and never watch the bonus features.",1012953600,8,1975,4.629310344827586
1386509,4,B000050NS2,"for something like 10 years this film has been out of print. I was doubtful that it would ever be released on DVD, considering all the controversy surrounding it.
THere's a lot of internal jokes on the DVD, references to Bonzai being a real person, which is sort of cute and amusing when it is pulled off correctly. It finally has all of those deleted scenes that everyonje has been clamoring for, for years.
If you watch this film though, be prepared to have your eyes and your senses assaulted by garish 80's fashions, 80's music, and some of your favorite stars with 80's hair. This entire film is so stuck in its time that it's hard to get past, unless you just let go and follow Peter Weller in his Miami Vice fashions and jump into the fun.

1386511,5,B000050NS2,"I've tried and failed to explain this movie to people who had never heard of it.  That's part of its charm: it is such a melange of comic book uber-achieving characters, science fiction distorted reality, tongue-in-cheek wierdness, and a steady torrent of subliminal jokes (think ""Airplane"") that it defies easy explanation.  That complex mixture also makes this as rewarding in its thirtieth viewing as its first, and has made this a regular favorite at Science Fiction & Fantasy Conventions and at Mensa Gatherings.  The reviews can tell you the plot; I'll tell you why I liked it.  I'll also tell you that you're likely to either love or loathe this movie.  You'll be in the first group if you 1)pay close attention to dialog and details, 2) thought that B-movie science fiction needs a send-up, 3) appreciate (or can at least tolerate) some inspired weirdness, and 4) want to see what an ""all star"" cast can do with some of the most (intentionally, I think) insipid lines ever placed in a script.  This is the movie that gave us that gem, ""No matter where you go, there you are.""
I jumped up and down in the store when I first saw that Buckaroo Banzai (easier to say than the full title, or even TAOBBATED) on DVD, and plunked down my money immediately.  I was not disappointed. The quality is exceptional after all those years of VHS viewing.  (The Anamorphic Letterbox presentation also fixes that disturbing compression of the end titles that marred earlier tape releases).  The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack was a pleasant bonus.  The DVD includes the expected outtakes, director's commentary, alternate beginning with Jamie Lee Curtis, and other goodies to keep the faithful entertained for hours!
All of that doesn't detract from the fact that this is one of the oddest movies of the last two decades.  The alternate beginning helps only a little in the initial impression that the viewer missed the first third of the film.  That disorientation causes many to miss some good throw-aways that serve as the film's visual wallpaper.  (For example, the computer displays during the countdown  [in a test of Buckaroo's Jet-powered, oscillation overthruster-equipped pickup truck] show status as ""Sined"", ""Seeled"" and ""Delivered"".)  I can get choked up just thinking of Dr. Banzai's resume: Brain Surgeon, Particle Physicist, Test Pilot, frontman of the hard-rocking (and heat packin') Hong Kong Cavaliers, and leader of an elite team that mobilizes to save the world, with a posse of Blue Blaze Irregulars (whom I believe discovered their calling from an ad in the back of a comic book.)

In addition to excellent sound and a very good transer, there are more extras than one will know what to do with. I'm big on deleted scenes and the like, and there are quite a few here. Most especially, the expanded beginning sequence that shows/tells about the explosion that killed Buckaroo's dad (and features Jamie Lee Curtis).
This is a love-it-or-hate it film, to be sure. Those that hate it aren't reading this. Those that love it just want to know if it's worth the money. I love it and it's worth every penny.",1012089600,8,653,4.5423728813559325
1386514,5,B000050NS2,"Before ""Austin Powers"" there was BUCKAROO BANZAI - Poet, Doctor, Global Protector and Man-About-Town. Buckaroo made it to the 8th dimension a dozen years ago, but it took a minor miracle to get himself released on DVD - and at an affordable price at that!  IT'S WELL WORTH THE WAIT.  This is a hysterical, inspired movie that lets the audience enjoy a wild bumpy unexpected and thrilling ride (if you dare.)
John Lithgow is brilliant as the hunch-backed mad scientist Lizardo.  He's a chameleon of an actor and here proves he can and will do ANYTHING to become his character.  With bad hair days  and bad teeth to boot, his Lizardo is a devilish creature you'll love!  Lithgow plays this part TO THE HILT.  Peter Geller looks great in the title role, but in his character's self-depreciating style, is regularly upstaged by Chris Lloyd and Ellen Barkin in flashier supporting roles.  Still, you can't help lovin' Buckaroo and his band of heros as they fight off the bad guys, tackle resident aliens, cure diseases, rescue entire nations, and go about their everyday humdrum Superhero lives.  Like ""Rocky Horror"" before it with its inside jokes, wild characters and odd edits, ""Banzai"" time warps, space-travels and shimmies.  Heck - the Banzai theme ALONE will keep you humming for days.  And when you least expect it, out of nowhere you'll burst out laughing thinking about a particular scene or character (and that's easy to do with names like Perfect Tommy, Penny ""Pretty"" Priddy and John Big Booty (John Big-bootaay.)
Destined to always stand as a camp epic, movie-moguls and Broadway producers should consider varied versions for the masses(as in BIG BUCKAROOS). At minimum the film should have  extended run midnight show at the local cinema (like ""Rocky Horror"" ... a much needed alternative to Friday nights.)  I bet plenty of folks would enjoy experiencing Buckaroo on the big screen, since most of us missed it the first time around!
Not only is this a fun family flick that withstands repeat viewings it also provokes uninhibited childish outbursts that we all need every once in awhile - especially these days.  PLUS,
the DVD is chock-full of goodies that BUILD on the film experience, and tie some tangled pieces together for its audience (and trust me, you'll be confused.)  Yes, the sets are truly tacky at times, and Ed Wood-ish qualities abound.  But those exact same qualities make it that much more FUN!  In fact, as strange and as stupid as it becomes at times (and it WILL BE at first) part of the magic is letting it swallow you whole!  In the end, it may still seem stupid or inane, but I bet you'll never forget it!
I'm suprised the BANZAI franchise hasn't been more deliberately marketed to new generations and audiences.  Most likely, no one can be really be expected to improve on this original and its  dishevelled work of genius.  Plus, the film's idiosyncracies and values might be doomed in an update or remake, and that would be a shame.  Think ""Planet of the Apes"".  THAT SAID, in the right hands, with its RAIDERS of the LOST ARK themes and STAR WARS shtick, I'd bet on Buckaroo!  Calling Dreamworks!  Again, the story needs repeat viewings to be enjoyed fully, but don't worry about keeping up - half the fun is not knowing exactly WHAT's going on, but experiencing it anyway.  Just listen closely and enjoy!  And remember - ""no matter where you go, there you are""!!",1011916800,16,3401,4.779109589041096

If Penny Priddy could be digitally re-clothed and given a new hairdo, she'd look great.
""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Little Shop of Horrors"" are similar in a dated, campy way to this movie, but they're both actually good.",1011916800,2,484,4.705882352941177

1386527,5,B000050NS2,"BB is one of these movies with the highest quotefactor. Nearly all scenes contain a sentence, a dialoge or a gesture that one can use for any occasion. Its like Ghostbusters or MIB, but with one flaw: Noone knows it (esp. here in germany) and without the reference you can sound very strange, e.g. when quoting ""tell ya later"" as an answer to a serious question.
Unfortunately there was never a good version of the movie available. Either the screen was filled with just a third of the original picture (as in the actual vhs-version), or when on tv they send a old fuzzy copy and cut the end credits(AAAARGH!).

1386528,5,B000050NS2,"THE FILM
BB is second to ""Rocky Horror"" as the greatest cult film ever.
A lot of the recent appeal is the ""Before they were Stars"" factor--Peter Weller, Robocop; JOHN Lithgow, 3rd Rock; Jeff Goldblum, Ten Speed and Brownshoe, Jurassic Park; Christopher Lloyd, Back to the Future, Taxi; Vincent Schiavelli, Subway Guy in Ghost; Yakov Smirnov, plays the Secretary of Defense.
They characters look like the people they are supposed to play. Weller is gaunt and tan enough so that he does indeed look half-Japanese. Vincent Schiavelli looks alien enough, and Lithgow does one mean Mussolini. Ellen Barkin is perfect as a lost girl in a big city.
This is sci-comedy, along the lines of Ghostbusters, Hitchhikers Guide, where it simultaneously contributes to the Genera while satirizing it. Look at all of the BB references on Star Trek!  In the commentary, Ruach and Richter explain they were imitating the odd humor found in ""DR. STANGELOVE,"" so see that film first before you judge!  PS--the watermelon in the Steel press is explained in the audio commentary.
There are emotions surrounding a film, and meaning found in repeating lines, as in Rocky Horror, or Princess Bride. It almost becomes a type of liturgy, where the filmed padre speaks his parts, and we respond-a communion of comedy! A morality play!  Ruach and Richter want us to believe that BB is actually a docudrama of a real but enigmatic person.  And at a certain level, we want to believe them!
The choice for synthesized music was correct, and also a slice of the times, as in Ladyhawke, or Tron. The music itself is catchy, killer, and DEMANDS TO HAVE A CD ISSUE!
For those who don't like this film, try these things. First, you need to see this film. Secondly, read some of the BB fan-pages on the Internet. Thirdly, see the film again. Fourthly, read the book, which is the indispensable companion to the film. Fifthly, see the film again. Repeat the process until you get it. I think it takes about 6 viewings (or is it 88?) viewings of this film to understand it.
On the down side, this film has been described as being ""Part 6"" of a series. We enter ""in the middle of things,"" but it is more like ""in the muddle of things."" There is the Elvis-esq Banzai, surrounded by a cloud of secondary characters that we see for a second, and then they pass. ""In the middle of things"" may not have been the best place to introduce the world to Dr. Banzai. Why not do the origin story and work foreword?  True that Lucas began with Episode IV, not with Episode I, but the cadre of characters was smaller and easier to follow. ""Doc Savage: Man of Bronze,"" Unbreakable,"" or ""Batman I"" are great origin films, and we are not complicated by secondary characters such as Patricia Savage, or Robin and Batgirl. Slowly they worked up to the secondary characters
For example of this middle-muddle, the gatekeeper ""Pinky Carruthers"" has an extensive background. He is a Blue Blaze Irregular, is Knight Commander, and knows 47,000 unknown facts. But this in not germane to the story and is wisely never mentioned in the film, just in the book. But this background may have a bearing on any future episodes of this movie.  There was a lot of work for something that never surfaced. The Simpsons slowly worked up to all the secondary characters, with the core of the Five Favorite Family members being the lynchpin of all Springfield. There was too much ambition--you always leave room for growth.
Editing destroyed The Abyss, and hurt this film. I agree that the parts of Hanoi Xan were wisely taken out of the film, since this would only add another layer of complexity that was not germane to the film, but other scenes were taken out for no reason, which hurt the continuity of the film, such as the extended beginning which showed Dr. Banzai's early life, and death of his parents.
This picture has a lot of action, but it doesn't accentuate the action. Dr. Banzai parachutes out of the spaceship, but they could have made his exit more dramatic.  And he is a martial artist, but the extent of his physical action is to kick an alien in the crotch.  Marital artist huh?
!!!THIS DVD IS STUFFED FULLER THAN SANTA'S SACK!!!
They are finally making DVDs that utilize the technology to the utmost!
The copy is superb, light-years ahead of the grainy copy on the VHS re-release, plus it is in wide screen format, so you actually see the movies in its panoramic glory.  It is indeed like seeing another movie!  The only problem is that the work prints are of a lower quality than the rest of the film, but we can deal with it.
Included are all of the deleted scenes from the editors work print, the bootleg that has been floating around for a decade and a half.  Paramount of these scenes is the original opening with Jamie Lee Curtis as Buckaroo's mother.  Frankly, this is the beginning that should have been the theatrical release, and the film not only makes more sense, but you emotionally connect with Dr. Banzai and the trauma he has experienced.  In a movie they should show you what happened, you shouldn't have to read about it!
Other extras are a bio on Dr. Banzai, and a sample of his philosophy, plus some of Pinky Carruther's 47,000 unknown facts are presented as an optional subtitle.
This DVD will keep you busy for hours!!!
Marketing note: The original film poster, the current VHS and the DVD cover all stink, but what would be a good one? I don't know.

1386531,5,B000050NS2,"I first heard of Buckaroo Banzai at a science fiction convention in 1984.  The filmmakers were showing a preview and handing out Team Banzai headbands.  The film was being pitched as a ""docudrama"" (though I'm not sure that was the word used at the time.)  They presented it as if it were a dramatization of real events in the life of Buckaroo Banzai, a scientist/rock star/neurosurgeon/crime fighter, combatting evil red lectroids from planet 10.  The marketing ploy assured cult status for the movie, though the nature of the film probably would have assured it anyway.  Others have done a good job of reviewing the film itself, so I won't go into that beyond saying I loved it, and will instead focus on the DVD special features.
I just finished going through the DVD features, and one of the most unusual aspects of the special features is that they never let go of the ""docudrama"" conceit.  The director's commentary is with the director and the ""real"" Reno.  There's an ""unknown facts"" subtitle track with ""quotes"" from Buckaroo Banzai, background information on the ""real"" people the movie is about, historical and biological information about red and black lectroids, etc.  It's an entertaining concept, but I really would have liked more honest background information at times.  There is some real information, but it often contrasts the actor to the ""real"" person he's playing, or talks about how the actor and the character go out clubbing.
There's a ""making of"" documentary that seems to be a new documentary using some footage taken at the time the original film was made plus some new footage, and again, the director thanks the ""Banzai Institute"" and Buckaroo himself for their help in making the film.  It's certainly worth watching.
There's also a very interesting trailer for a CG Buckaroo Banzai TV series they were trying to get going in 1998.  It looks like it would have been a fun series if they could have converted the style of the trailer into viable scripts.
The deleted scenes are also interesting, and give a little more background on some of the characters, but it's easy to see why they were cut.
Overall, I'd say the special features were among the best I've seen, with only ""Legally Blonde"" doing better for entertainment value in the added material.  This DVD is a definite ""must-have"" for any serious sci-fi geek, and the rest of you out there will almost certainly enjoy it, too.  To those who don't like the film, there's really only one thing to say:  ""Laugh while you can, monkey boy!""",1010793600,2,2523,4.823665893271461

The packaging of the film in the special edition DVD release is amazing.  Too many special editions are simply haphazard collections of trailers and pointless cut scenes.  While this dVD does have the trailers and cut scenes (would have been nice if they could have been integrated into the movie, as the X-Men DVD did); it has soo much more.  Trivia, commentary, interviews, all very well done; using the ""docu-drama"" format that really kicks it from ""about the film"" to something truly appropriate for a cult classic of this nature -- often contrasting the ""real"" story behind certain scenes with the ""toned down for the film"" version.
""Pinky Carruthers' Unknown Facts"", a running subtitle commentary with trivia and editorial comments (again, in the docu-drama vein) is so well done, and so funny, that it alone justifies the purchase of the DVD.  But it's not alone.  There is also detailed information on the Jet Car (a real jet car made by Thrust Racing), the ""bunkhouse"", the Lectroids, the ""real"" Team Banzai and the actors who portrayed them in the film, and much more.
The transfer is amazing, with the clearest and cleanest picture i've seen, short of a ""never before run"" print in a theatre.  The audio is also well done, there are no noticible compression artifacts visible anywhere.
I have seen few special edition packages to compare (the only two that come to mind are Fight Club and Monty Python and the Holy Grail).",1010793600,3,1589,4.7355072463768115
1386533,5,B000050NS2,"Hooray for DVD!
I saw ""Buckaroo Banzai: Across the 8th Dimension"" during its original theatrical run back in1984, and though I enjoyed its wacked-out (and sometimes very subtle) humor, I had no idea what the hell was going on plot-wise. The film opened with a screen full of text that gave me the entire background to the characters, but that quick burst simply wasn't enough to bring me into the movie's world.  The movie seemed to start in the middle and work its way to both ends simultaneously.  I'm telling you, if I hadn't been a Doc Savage fan as a kid, I would have never caught on to anything in the movie.  For a few years I thought that my confusion was due to the fact that I was both drunk and high when I saw the film in the theater, but when I saw it on TV later on, I realized that I still didn't quite get it.
Well, BB gained a cult following over the last decade and a half, and now it is getting the royal treatment on DVD. I can't go into all the extras, there are simply too many of them.  The feature I want to discuss is the ""Extended Version"", in particular the restored original opening sequence which was cut from the 1984 theatrical version.
This extensive opening sequence (which by the way features Jamie Lee Curtis as Buckaroo's mom) is presented in the form of archival footage from the Banzai Institute, with narration explaining the origins of Buckaroo (including his name) as well as the origins and functions of the movie's main plot device, the Oscillation Over thruster.
I cannot tell you in strong enough terms how much the reinstatement of this opening sequence improves the film. If director W.D. Richter had left it on back in '84, the film might not have had to ferment 15 years to become a hit!",1010707200,12,1737,4.41875

1386538,4,B000050NS2,"If, like me, you're a fan of this movie and are looking forward to the DVD with all the special extras, I must warn you; you *may* be dissapointed.
There's a ton of stuff on this DVD, and you *should* own it, but the special feature I was most looking forward to was the most dissapointing to me.
The running commentary by the director W. D. Richter and writer Earl Mac Rauch is nothing like what I was hoping for. I was hoping for a real examination of the writing and directing of the film, *as you'd expect* when the director and writer are sitting there for 2 hours talking about it.
Instead we have the writer, pretending he's one of the *real* Honk Kong Cavaliers, from the 'real' world, talking about how 'accurate' the movie is compared to reality. The conceit here is that Reno wrote a book based on a real adventure, and Richter directed a movie based on that book. The writer is always referred to as 'Reno,' he's in this commentary *playing* the 'real' Reno who's played by Pepe Serna in the movie.
This is something that might confuse the casual fan, something I'm sure Richter and Rauch thought would be deliciously ironic. A movie that many people (not me) found confusing with a commentary that further confuses the issue. I wasn't confused, I was just really sick of them explaining it over and over again because *they* thought it would be confusing.
The writer doesn't actually talk much during the entire commentary. The director talks a lot about the casting, that's neat, but it's always within the context of the 'real' buckaroo. There's not much else about the production or filming of the movie.
This notion, that the film is really a movie based on a novel written by a real Hong Kong Cavalier about a real event that happened to him and Buckaroo and the rest of the group, would be neat if we ended up learning a whole bunch about the group. It'd be neat to learn what the different divisions of the Banzai Institute are, how one becomes a HK Cavalier, what the Institute is working on now. We don't get anything like that. They spend most of the commentary making sure we understand the idea that the institute is 'real' in the first place. So it's an interesting idea with nearly 0 follow-through.
The DVD is *packed* with extra features including deleted scenes, interviews, and just a ton of extra stuff, much of which is really cool. So, buy the DVD. It's a *great* print of the film, crisp, clear, a perfect transfer. The sound is great, though I found it frustrating that there were no subtitles and you have to go back to the menu if you want to switch audio tracks (very frustrating). But if you're looking forward to the inside scoop on how this movie was made (and if you're a fan of the film, how can you not be?) you may be dissapointed by the commentary.",1010188800,3,2795,4.4931237721021615
1386539,5,B000050NS2,"The best part about the DVD version--apart from finally seeing the film in letterbox--was how it maintains that it's nonfiction docudrama instead of pulp sci-fi action comedy.  The ""Pinky Carruthers' Unknown Facts"" subtitle overlay track pops up some hilarious pseudotrivia and commentary on how Rawhide isn't dead but comatose, that the Lectroids' holoprojector formed the basis for the DVD player, that the violent acts perpetrated by the Red Lectroids had to be toned down from what ""really"" happened, that Buckaroo took Einstein's preserved brain with him in the Jet Car at the beginning, and quotes like ""Comfort the afflicted, afflict the comfortable.""  In addition to the deleted footage (Penny's lament included an unemployment agent telling her to be a hooker, the John Emdall holo reacted to Perfect Tommy's commentary on Soviet jumpiness), it allows you reintegrate the original ""home movie"" opening sequence featuring the death of Buck's parents.

THis is hte reason i find this DVD so strange. It's relitively unknown, yet it got teh royal treatment. First off the disc is animorphic, which is an enormous jump form all the old vhs copies i've seen of this movie. In fact up until yesterday, the best copy I had ever seen of this movie was plagued by grain and color shimmer. The picture on the dvd is perfect; crisp ,clean and artifact free. In the same vein the film is widescreen, which means that the squished and elongated characters seen at the endings creidts, on the vhs version, are now restored to their origional selves. The sound is not mind blowing but it is just as good as any other dvd i've ever heard. I did hear hte theme song i nthe movie alot more than i remembered, so maybe the audio is vastly improved too, i;m not an audio dood, sorry. As far as extras go, i'm surprised that so many still exist. There are 1 deleted scenes on this thing, in relatively good quality too. In addition there is the origional opening of the film which i'm glad they cut out. THere's a making of documentary, and a commentary track i haven't listened too yet. In addition there are specs on the rocket car, weird tidbits of info o nth history of buckaroo bonzai, and all kinds of other interesting stuff. If you like this movie, but hte dvd now, it is absolute gold.

1386542,4,B000050NS2,"As far as cult flicks go, ""Buckaroo Banzai"" remains one of my personal favorites.  Blending fantasy, action, and even comedy into a rather surprising mix, this movie hits the notes perfectly (despite the slight dating to the 1980's, the decade of which it was born).  The DVD itself becomes a bit of an in-joke for the movie itself, going as far as to claim the movie is a ""docu-drama"" based on real events.  The commentary by director W.D. Richter (and a man who calls himself Reno who may or may not be the film's screenwriter) blends reality and fiction together by not only explaining the making of the film, but about the involvement of Buckaroo Banzai, the man (and for you fans, there may be an honest explanation to one of the films more obscure gags, the watermelon).  Also included are some deleted scenes, a documentary, an alternate opening, profiles of the characters (NOT the cast and crew), and some interesting notes of the history of Banzai.  Considering the price it's available for and the amount of stuff to look at, this Special Edition is definitely a Banzai fan's dream.",1010016000,12,1093,4.731578947368421
1386543,4,B000050NS2,"Surreal, off the wall and down right gut splitting funny, BB was a full decade of its time. The cast is clearly having fun with the material. You'd think that the folks from Planet 10 would learn something from Superman's experience with the Phantom Zone--limbo can't keep nasty, evil and weird aliens out of your hair forever.
This deluxe DVD has a beautiful wide screen transfer of the film, 14 outtakes taken from the workprint (and integrated into the sequences they were cut from so they actually make sense)and the alternate opening with Jaime Lee Curtis as Buckaroo's mom (that explains this film!). THe cast is a who's who of cult films and odd ball performances; Peter Weller plays the brain surgeon/rock star/agent for good (ala Doc Savage)with wit and a sparkle in his eye; Ellen Barkin sparkles in one of her first major screen roles as Penny Pretty the despondent, sexy secret twin sister of Buckaoo's late lover; Jeff Goldblum helped define quirky with his straight faced performance as ""New Jersey""; John Lithgow shines as the possessed scientist Dr. Lizzardo playing Lizzardo as an over the top melodrama villian (with a bizarre Italian accent no less!). The cast also includes Christopher Lloyd, Clancey Brown and a watermelon...
The inclusion of the trailer for the never made television series from 1998 is a gem although it doesn't quite convey the quirkiness of the film. I kept wondering, who else besides Peter Weller (who's much too old to play BB nearly 20 years later) could pull the role off?
My only complaint is that since I don't have a nuon enhanced DVD I can't enjoy this weird feature. Still, with the running commentary from Richter and pop up factoids of Pinkie, this deluxe edition of a great cult classic finally gets its due. It gives me hope that MGM went to as much effort as they have at putting this fine DVD together.

Peter Weller (Robocop) stars as Buckaroo Banzai, a neurosurgeon, rock star, physicist and two-fisted defender of justice who also protects the President along with an assorted group of heroes who are also his band mates.  In an attempt to break the interdemensional barrier, Banzai accidentally opens the flood gates for a bevy of bad-guy aliens who have been hiding incognito on earth since 1938, when Orson Welles' famed ""War of the Worlds"" radio address proved to be a hoax.  Now he must stop them from returning to their home planet or lose the planet to nuclear annihilation.  All of this, plus he has to save the girl!
Director W. D.

As a Systems Engineer working for national intelligence agencies and now a defense contractor I loved the lampooning of our industry.  I swear I work for YoYodyne!  I viewed with interest the movie's portrayal of the cutting edge computer systems of the day that were all text-based screens.  Indeed we have come a long way with Motif, x-Windows and (dare I say it/) MS NT.

1386562,5,B000050NS2,"The main reason I love this movie is the amazing performance by John Lithgow as Dr. Emilio Lizardo, aka Lord John Whorfin.  His Nosferatu-like pallor, his rotting teeth and wild eyes, his Einstein-like scattered hair; the astounding accent and slavishly-imitating-Mussolini mannner; the cheesy b-movie-villain dialogue delivered with such gusto; it's all so wonderful.  Lithgow is one of our greatest clowns--he's up there with Nathan Lane and Darrell Hammond.  I endured much silliness watching ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" just to see what he would come up with next.  An undervalued national trasure (he's also a great dramatic actor too.)",992390400,3,637,5.404040404040404
1386563,5,B000050NS2,"Buckaroo Banzai, the product of a Japanese father and American mother, (I guess that explains the name) is a brilliant scientist, philanthropist, adventurer and rock star who, with his staff of oddly nicknamed sidekicks, must save the world, (again) this time from invaders from space. It seems Orson Wells' War of the Worlds broadcast wasn't a hoax after all...I have just one question: Is somebody ever going to explain about that watermelon?",992217600,,444,5.180555555555555
1386564,4,B000050NS2,"As a devoted Buckaroo Banzai fan for the last 15 years, I was disappointed that this ""new"" video release was taken from an old, beat-up print. The sound is ho-hum as well.
One of my all-time favorite movies, in all its threadbare glory...
It's too bad all the rumors about a well-restored DVD were wrong.
Given that this is the only release of this film available, I give it 4 stars. But it really is a sad, sad effort at a re-release.",990748800,3,435,4.317073170731708
1386565,5,B000050NS2,"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, lovingly written by Earl Mac Rauch, harks back and pays homage to the wonderful Doc Savage novels by Lester Dent with a little comedy thrown into the mix.  It's funny.  When I first saw this movie at the Oleander Theater in Wilmington, NC, I was one of ten people in attendance.  Everyone in the theater, including myself, thoroughly enjoyed himself or herself and I kind of felt sorry for everyone who either deliberately ignored the movie or laughed at me for going to see it.  Now, those same people are telling me how much they like this film!  If only they listened to me the first time.  Now, you, fellow customer who is considering to part from your hard earned money, can slap those bucks down and purchase this wonderful, tongue-in-cheek, science fiction adventure packed with a lot one liners and memorable quotes.  For example, everyone has heard of the quote, ""No matter where you go, there you are."" It originated and was first spoken by Buckaroo.  Don't be a monkey boy.  Buy this film!",989884800,6,1035,4.705555555555556
1386566,4,B000050NS2,"To begin, the first time I saw this movie, at age thirteen, I didn't get it.  I got lost at the part where Lithgow (Dr. Lizardo) attaches the electrode to his tongue, then cuts to a flashback.  I thought that the electricity had done something to him . . . I was just lost.
Then I came back for the end credits . . .
Well, this movie became a sci-fi ""Ishtar"" for me, although ""Battlefield Earth"" seems to have become the new sci-fi ""Ishtar.""  Well, last year for reasons I have forgotten I was surfing the BB fan pages, and they mentioned they were re releasing the film.  Later that night, a friend of mine started talking about the movie.  Odd!  So I bough the movie on a whim.
I saw it with a fellow sci-fi afficionado, and boy were we surprised!  It was like watching another movie.  I got the humor, which was absurd humor.  Like trying to figure our British or Jewish humor, absurd humor requires some practice.  It is an acquired taste.
GOOD:  Where can you see John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, Peter Weller, Jeff Goldblum, and the subway guy from ""Ghost"" all in one movie?  This is it.  Absolutely impossible to do a sequel!  Not enough money to pay all of these people.  Plus, this is a tongue-in-cheek ""sci-fi comedy cult"" film.  Weird mishmash!
BAD:  From what I read on the fan pages on the web, this film was rather butchered in the editing process.  Knowing how things go on the Internet, I am inclined to belive this.  It was that weird transition to a flashback that lost me the first time around.
Also, if you don't like absurd humor, you will not like this movie.
Another difficulty for me was the costuming.  In some scenes, Lloyd would appear as a human, then appear with a weird mask on.  When I re-saw the film, I realized that when we say the masks it was because Buckaroo had been translated to see the aliens.  If you don't realize this, the film become trans-absurd.
ABSURD:  Probably the watermelon in the steel press.  Plus the ""Sined, Seeled, Delivered"" sequence at the beginning.
CULT:  One again, according to the fan pages, the novelization of the film is even more complex, with Dr Hanoi Xan, Dr. Masado Banzai's rival, who was masterminding the Lectriods.  Complex!
It seems that BB is a cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boy's ""SMiLE"" album--edited and hacked beyond recognition.",989625600,2,2314,4.555825242718447
1386567,4,B000050NS2,"This is either going to be one of the most ridiculous movies you've ever seen, or one of the stupidest movies you've ever wasted your time watching. The result really depends almost exclusively on your appreciation of the absurd.

1386568,4,B000050NS2,"This movie was unfortunately released before its time. It got good reviews in the newspapers and magazines, but I saw it on opening night in a nearly-empty theater and it was gone shortly afterwards. A few years later, films such as Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, Big Trouble In Little China (same writer as BB), Men In Black, and Galaxy Quest would make audiences more receptive of sci-fi and/or fantasy movies that played as comedies. Its production values aren't the greatest, and it definitely looks dated (8o's hairstyles, clothing, and music), but it has a quirky, hip quality to it. The movie also features a lot of  stars (John Ligthow, Christopher Lloyd, Ellen Barken, Peter Weller, Jeff Goldblum) who went on to bigger and better things. A campy film that could have been the start of something great...too bad it never caught on!",985910400,4,843,4.895104895104895
1386569,3,B000050NS2,"I saw this film when it was in theaters in the 80's and it struck me as fun, original, and unique. A few years later I purchased it and was disappointed. I concluded that it was the kind of picture best discovered by accident. To appreciate Buckaroo Bonzai you really have to lower your expectations for science fiction and comic book genre films. The script is very quirky and the jokes are often too subtle to inspire big laughs, i.e. ""What's that watermelon for?""  It plods at a pace too slow for a real adventure. Fans of the 80's comics like  ""Love and Rockets"" will find it interesting, but if you're into blockbusters like Star Trek or Batman--you'll probably hate it--a lot. It has one of those awful electronic soundtracks from the time period and it has become badly dated by its ""Flock of Seagulls"" wardrobe and hair styles. However, even with its flaws it has a strange nostalgic charm for folks who think thin pink ties, rolled up jacket sleeves, and Flash Gordon serials are still nifty. It's worth a look--but not a very long one...",985305600,2,1047,4.593582887700535

But, being an avid movie buff, I knew that certain films, (usually the best ones), must be viewed more than once to really be appreciated.  So, I watched it again, and again, and again.  I soon realized that I couldn't stop watching it.  I had fallen in love.  It isn't easy to find a film that goes totally out of bounds and really has fun with itself.  Buckaroo Bonzai is entertainment with brains and heart and a whole bunch of ""what the...""  I guess my friends were right after all.",983232000,2,659,4.216

It took me about 4 viewings to ""get it"" about this great movie.  It's a sci-fi comedy that flows, looks, and reads like a comic book.  Buckaroo himself is over the top multi-talented and even has a comic book title named after him.  He and his band of followers must stop an invasion from the 8th dimension.  But be forewarned -- the movie is sometimes hard to follow (you must pay close attention) and the humor is somtimes not obvious.
