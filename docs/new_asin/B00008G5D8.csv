7982478,5,B00008G5D8,"This is absolutely terrific for any bass player. All the excercises he shows on the video are also transcribed in a little book let that comes with it. Great for people that are trying to learn more about music theory and get more technical with their playing. The excercises are not impressive or necessarily fun, (a lot of choral patterns, chordal applications, etc.) but if you run them every day, or even less probably, you will be amazed with your progress. This guy went to Berkley College of Music so basically you are getting a seminar from Berkley School of Music without the insane entrance test and the pressure of swinging with the best of the best all the time. In addition to the excercises are a few little impressive pieces and at the end he jams with Derek Sherinian and Mike Portnoy. This film really helped me a lot, not just with playing but also theory and some cool techniques (he shows his three finger technique and how to practice it, some tapping technique and more). I would say definitely buy it, I already have it and I will buy it again when it comes out on dvd or bluray.",1270166400,,1102,4.487562189054726
