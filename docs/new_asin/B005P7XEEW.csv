4856455,2,B005P7XEEW,"Ok, I turned Kill Katie Malone off way into the movie last night so I could fall asleep in the chair. The movie is that bad. The movie is shot in what is supposed to be a college dorm. So much of this movie is shot in very small rooms. The college isn't even good for atmosphere. At least they could have used some older college with a history, with old architecture. But no, the rooms look quite modern. The three young college kids also must be complete idiots, for after having bought a so called ghost online horrible events soon transpire but the college students simply can't see or feel any ""ghostly"" connection to any of it. When the ghost visits their small dorm apartments they again stay very DUMB to the point of retardation. A ghost was in the bed or it just trashed the apartment but yet it must have been some fast very moving college senior or junior. Yes, upperclassmen are picking on the lower classmen.

The acting is terrible in this movie as is the dialogue. Dean Cain is supposedly in this movie but what I saw was a cameo at the beginning of the movie. He is the one who put the ghost on the ""YouBid"" auction website. I don't know if he is in the middle of the movie or not but PHASE FOUR studios milks his name for all it is worth by putting it above the movie title. I assumed Dean Cain would have a measurable part in the movie, but it seems he only had a very minor acting part.

I'll finish this movie later but be forwarned this movie is simply POOR. Yes, some people are killed but even then we don't get to see much. So just don't expect much from this movie. And forget about there being any dramatic tension. This movie is just another ""dramatic turd"" in a collective punch bowl of bad movies.",1348876800,3,1726,4.259146341463414
4856456,4,B005P7XEEW,"I don't recall the picture on the cover being part of the movie. Three college kids purchase an Irish ghost on-line. The spirit grants them wishes, but also protects them at the cost of others. The ghost, for some reason, likes to redecorate, and is not very good at it.

The film is low budget. The gore sequences take place off camera to avoid the idiotic special effects that kill low budget productions. Instead they spent their money on a good script, some fair acting and direction. Better than an Asylum production. Makes for a fair rental.

The movie has the same scare potential as the paranormal series, without the annoyance. It sets up for a sequel with some real potential.

4856457,4,B005P7XEEW,"I just watched this movie this morning on Netflix wondering if I was going to hate it.  Much to my surprise, I actually found it entertaining and worth at least a few more watches.  It's not all that original and it's not all that gorey, so I wouldn't mind letting a tweener watch this one.  Others here have outlined the plot of the angry ghost of Katie Malone, so I won't rehash it again.  It's got a basically good premise; this ghost wants family and wants to keep them together at ANY cost, so lots of people who mess with our three protagonists are dealt with in very unsavory ways.  I have to say that, unlike some of these types of movies I've watched, the script isn't half bad, and the story keeps you glued to the end.  There are a few surprises in the plotline, but I won't give them away, and the story of Katie as a human is actually quite sympathetic.  It won't scare you out of your wits like a more expensive film, but if you're not big on gore like I'm not, I'd urge you to check it out.  It won't win an oscar, but it's downright entertaining.",1335139200,,1062,4.197044334975369
4856458,1,B005P7XEEW,"The only thing scary about this movie was the DVD cover photo which if it appeared at all in the movie - I missed it. Usual cheap scary effects of sounds and thrashing about that you don't see until post event when a room is shown with furniture tossed about and the usual obscure message scrawled on the wall which is given to the usual academician for interpretation. Usual couple of scenes using wire and green screen and props to show people being held up in the air by a mysterious misbehaving spirit. The search for box-with-trapped- spirit becomes contemporary with an online auction. Winner, appropriately for this movie, calls the losing bidder a jerk because he got aced out at the last moment by the winner. That and the usual act tough swearing and dialogue makes the script writing as juvenile as the storyline.  Usual bad guy - good guy love triangle. Usual it's not over ending when the box is sent to someone else where the spirit gets out to wreck future movie havoc. High school drama class style acting and cheap production utilizing a couple of room and hall way sets. Even the credits list was surprisingly short.",1332460800,,1134,4.641791044776119

4856460,4,B005P7XEEW,"This movie had a lot more ""bump"" in it than I thought it would, making it a low budget that scored high in the B movie range that might have been really bad but was better than anticipated.

Basically, a group of college students looking for a thrill go online and find a box for sale. It offers your very own ghost. The three laugh and two are apprehensive because of both price and what is offered, but one wants and buys it. When it arrives a few odd things happen, and the oddity turns deadly and makes them wonder what, if anything, can be done about the spirit of someone named Katie Malone.

Like I said, it is a cheap movie. The ending is somewhat disappointing. Dean Cain has a cameo in it despite his high billing. These things are kind of what I expected, however. what I did not expect were some rather creepy moments in the middle of the film, or a few times when I actually wondered what the ghost would want.

This is NOT to say I would buy the film, I thought about it but am still debating that, but watching it was entertaining enough. I am a fan of lower budget horror so that does help with these, but a few of my friends who watched this also seemed to think it was a lot better than expected. It is already coming on the movie channels, too, if that means anything to someone wanting to make up their minds whether or not to pick it up.

I would say watch some of it, the plot is not complex and it solely relies on the horror of the moment. If that does not seem up to par for you, then pass on it.

3.5/5 - noting that this is a grade on lower budget movies, not to be confused with a 3.5 on some  big budget scale.",1328918400,3,1639,4.0588235294117645
4856461,3,B005P7XEEW,"In spite of top billing, actor Dean Cain appears only briefly in this horror film.  I don't believe his work here even rises to that of a special guest star, more of a walk-on.  The real stars are the 3 college students who buy a box online, purported to encase a ghost.  The movie details the repercussions of their actions upon opening said box and releasing the ghost within.  What follows is a bit weak.  Few overt chills are produced (I counted only one genuinely creepy moment), the bulk of the frights are pure suggestion: did you hear that, did you see that, what was that!?  Most of the victims simply throw themselves against walls as unseen forces supposedly attack them (none of this is effective).  At best, this serves as how not to make a ghost story.  (The idea proves more interesting than its execution.)

I'm not sorry I watched it once, it held my interest for 91 minutes, but I have no plans to watch it ever again.",1328918400,3,936,4.458823529411765
4856462,2,B005P7XEEW,"Kill Katie Malone was so disappointing,the only bright spot was looking at Steven Colletti whom is very attractive but his acting and demeanor is more suited for a PG movie at best,you can take the boy out of Laguna Beach but!
The effect's consisted of the actors throwing themselves on the ground and into walls as if a malevolent force was doing it..maybe a drop of blood and weak storyline.
I say skip it,If you think this is going to scare you or gross you out ,wrong,it will only bore you to death. I saw it for free on cable and still wanted my time back. For synopsis read the one given.",1326326400,,594,4.3125
4856463,2,B005P7XEEW,"Kill Katie Malone is a step above most straight-to-video horror flicks in that the visuals are quality, but it has little more to offer besides that.  The movie tells the story of three friends in college that decide to buy a ghost on an online auction site, and receive a mysterious box soon after.  But after opening the box, a series of tragic events occur to people around them, and one of the trio tries to discover a means of reversing their fate.

This was the first feature film by director Carlos Ramos Jr, which is a surprise considering how well it was shot. The cinematography was good, as was the color correction.  The cast is made up largely of TV actors, so the performances are a bit better than what you'd expect for most low-budget horror movies.  Some horror aficionados may also appreciate that the malevolent spirit in the movie almost never appears in a visible form, which gives the movie a similar vibe as the 1982 film ""The Entity.""

That being said, Kill Katie Malone disappoints when it comes to the story itself.  The concept of passing along a curse or evil entity has already been done. The Ring, Drag Me to Hell, and the upcoming Heart-Shaped Box film based on the 2007 novel by Stephen King's son.  While the film does offer up a few unique deaths and injuries, it's light on blood for gore fans.  The movie simply plods along, with characters that are hard to keep up with, and a generally uninteresting plot.  And if you're a Dean Cain fan, you may want to pass on Kill Katie Malone. Despite having his name front and center on the movie's cover, Cain gets a grand total of five minutes of screen time for the entire film.

Considering this was the first major film project by Carlos Ramos, I'd say that he did a quality directing job.  The visual look of the film is enough to consider it four out of five stars, but the weak plot and uninspired writing drags it down to a two-star review. If you enjoy independent horror flicks like I do, it's certainly won't hurt to add this to your Netflix queue. Other than that, I wouldn't suggest buying the Blu-Ray until after you've at least given it a rent.",1326240000,5,2136,4.47680412371134

I suggest everyone watch this heart-racing flick.",1325462400,2,343,4.375

8482370,4,B005P7XEEW,"I just got finished with watching Kill Katie Malone. It was an OK movie... OK Horror. A few times I found myself saying, ""Umm... Aren't you going to tell them the super creepy thing that just happened??? I mean you all know about a possible ghost and what???? nothing???"" ...that kinda thing. Like, sure I was just attacked by something, but I'll meet you at the Soc-Hop tonight after going back to my spooky Dorm! Other than a bunch of this prattle it was a OK film. Fun and good acting with some very nice special effects. Overall a good premise, but they could have made it plainer and more direct as far as the story line. I'd recommend it for a fun night with the wife and give it 3 Skulls out of Five!!! (  ...maybe four if there was a nude scene!)",1356220800,,754,4.236111111111111
8482371,2,B005P7XEEW,"Here's the premise (I think?!):
You go on-line and buy a ghost which shows up in a strange little box.  But don't open the box or the vengeful spirit of servant girl Katie Malone will eventually kill you in truly graphic ways.  Once you release Katie, you have to somehow get her back in the box and sell her to some other on-line nincompoop.
This all plays out torturously slow with little thrills or terror.  And don't let Dean Cain's top billing fool you...he's only in two brief scenes that last no more than five minutes.
KILL KATIE MALONE has an intriguing if unbelievable plotline but its poor acting and uninspired direction sabotage the final results.",1355961600,,660,4.672413793103448
8482372,5,B005P7XEEW,This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time that has ghosts in it .the best !!!,1354838400,,90,3.3333333333333335
8482373,4,B005P7XEEW,"This is the story of three college students that buy a ghost (evil ghost) on an auction site. Not Ebay, but the other one. One student wants to buy the ghosts and the other two loan him the money, due to the fact most college students are broke and can't afford to buy ghosts online for $50. Sure that might sound like the makings of a comedy and it does have its moments of light heartedness, but this is a scary movie. The ghost comes in a box, and once the box is opened strange things happen and people get hurt or killed.

Kill Katie Malone is a low budget film with sparingly used quality special effects. They do a lot with a little. These are unknown actors (and actresses), so don't expect the charm, wit and laughs that movies like Scream brought, but they do a better job than most scary movies. The scares build to a boil toward the end with a good climax.

Oh and if you're some sort of Dean Caine fan, he's in this movie less than five minutes. At least the worst thing about it is the name. Give it a watch.",1348963200,,1022,4.156565656565657
