8410865,5,B003ZT1ZIE,"You can watch some of these shows at several sites on the internet, but the quality is terrible. I purchased this DVD set to get the complete collection and the quality is excellent. This is real classic TV from late 1949 to early 1950. Jackie Gleason does an okay performance as Chester Riley, although he's not as funny as William Bendix. Anyway, if you are a collector like me and want the best quality set of this old sitcom.. this collection is the one for you. I also purchased The Life of Riley with William Bendix from this merchant.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-of-Riley-William-Bendix-Collection-TV-Shows/dp/B003ZMBNK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life of Riley - William Bendix Collection - TV Shows</a>",1282003200,5,757,5.828828828828829
