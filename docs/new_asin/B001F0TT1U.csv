Approximately 325 minutes

Note that the subtitles are yellow which I find ugly.  They are clear and easy to read though.  This is one of the better English dubs that I've listened to, so I didn't count off for the yellow subtitles. Only one of the minor characters has an annoying voice, but it fits in well.  The 5.1 sound quality is amazing, but I am only listening to it on a Sony soundbar with a small sub.  I imagine it sounds even better with a quality 5.1 setup.

I knocked off a star for the complete lack of any booklets, artwork (except the discs which are nice), or interesting special features.  That was very disappointing.  The show makes up for it though with exceptional video and audio.  The story is wonderful and sucks you in with great characters and art.  The main character is a spear wielder, so there are some action scenes.  The fight scenes sound and look great, but are not the focus of the show in my opinion.

The rating is 13 and older, but with all anime I always recommend watching the entire show before you let your children watch it.  I feel this is one of the better anime for the whole family to enjoy from my conservative viewpoint.",1351814400,,1959,4.605187319884727
3559337,4,B001F0TT1U,Bought both part 1 and part 2.  Awesome anime with a great story line and characters.  Absolutely recommend this anime. You won't be disappointed.,1340755200,,146,5.041666666666667
3559338,5,B001F0TT1U,"I've only just ""discovered"" this recently and must say it was refreshing. The animation quality is top notch because if you'd told me it was a series at first I wouldn't have believed it. Money was spent doing this right.  Another upside is that even with all the action it doesn't fall prey to an all together common failing with anime lately: the habit of throwing everything but the kitchen sink into a wild melee where the eye has little chance to rest. Being able to blind someone with action doesn't mean you have or even NEED to. Story driven series with first rate art and humane pacing are always at the top of my list and this ranks up there with the best.",1322179200,,666,4.370967741935484
3559339,5,B001F0TT1U,"""Seirei no Moribito"" or ""Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit"" is about a traveling warrior and bodyguard named Balsa, ""The Spear Woman of Kanbal"".
As Balsa is traveling the land, in part to fulfill a vow she made long ago, she comes across a prince of an Imperial Family. His name is Chagum, and Balsa is witness to a supposed accident that nearly claims the young princes' life.
After saving the prince, Balsa is invited to the Imperial Palace where the second empress pleads with Balsa to take her young son away and become his bodyguard, as she fears his life may very well be near it's end.
Chagums' father, the Imperial Emperor, believes his son the prince is possessed by an evil spirit and must be offered up as a sacrifice so that his Kingdom will not experience a deadly drought. Although most of the Imperial court is reluctant to go through with this, they see no other way to save their homeland.

After firstly declining her request, Balsa accepts the task. Balsa also has good reason to save this young boy, as she has vowed to save the lives of eight people in order to attone for a ""sin"" that lays heavy in her heart. Balsa and Chagum flee from the palace, with some help from the second empress, and our story starts to unravel.
If Balsa succeeds in saving Chagum, this would be the eighth and final life she has saved.

Great opening, yeah? That's just the first episode. There is so much to love about Moribito, I could write all day about it.
The animation production by I.G. is amazing. The english dub is also surprisingly good. And Balsa has to be one of the most powerful and courageous female leads anime has given us.
Alot of you will no doubt have seen or heard about this fantastic anime, as it aired on Cartoon Networks Adult Swim in 2008 and 2009.
But whatever the case it's a classic that all otaku need to have in their collection.

So, if you love a fantasy that's not so ""cookie cutter"", but is something high above the rest of the genre, then Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit is waiting. Highly Recommended!",1301097600,,2039,4.490566037735849
3559340,5,B001F0TT1U,"I've seen the whole series of Moribito. It's based on a novel by Nahoko Uehashi and tells the story  of a female bodyguard who takes on a job to protect a prince from being killed by his own father. The violence never gets too intense, there is no sex, and the show is beautifully drawn and entertaining. I highly recommend it!",1267488000,,327,4.360655737704918
3559341,5,B001F0TT1U,"Few series in my mind have had the instant gratification as this first DVD has, save for Fighting Spirit.  Moribito, if this first disc is any indication, starts off with an interesting main character faced with an interesting dilemma.  After selflessly helping a Prince from certain death, Balsa is invited to the town's main palace, where the Second Queen of the Emperor summons Balsa for an unexpected request:  Save the Prince's life from assassination attempts by the Emperor himself.  It seems that the Prince, Chogu, has been 'possessed' by a demon and the Emperor must kill of his own son to save the Kingdom from dissent from this news.  And so Balsa accepts, not for money or power, but just by a self-imposed code of duty.

And so Moribito starts.

While this premise isn't wholly original (it has some inklings to Sword of the Stranger) the real draw is Basla.  A stoic female character with a moral code of her own doing, Balsa has a sense of wisdom and justice that doesn't feel forced.  She's been through much in her life and on this journey we follow her as she feels some nostalgia for her own youth and actions of the past.  Her way with a spear, (an unlikely weapon of choice for a lead role) and the fact that she is a strong woman figure older than twenty speaks volumes how this anime is beign approached.  Most roles of this kind fall on barely teen boys or girls with a propensity to be annoyingly stubborn and anti-authority.  The refreshing take on a female lead old enough to be thirty and have a sense of justice is a breath of fresh air in this so typical cliche genre.

Plus the production levels are amazing to boot.  This is one of the most beautiful animes out there.  Gorgeous animation and fluid movement litter the screen.  The fighting scenes are intense and just enthralling to look at.  It renders some of the most resent animes out there completely amateurish in comparison.  But after all, this is from the same folk that brought us Ghost in the Shell : Stand Alone Complex 1 & 2.  They are truly geniuses with their artwork, plus the combined use of 3d helps flesh out this world.

With all this in mind, there are still some questions to be answered.  How does the aspect of magic and fantasy going to figure out into the tale?

Still, even with that the first DVD is a welcomed addition to anyone's library.  This looks to be a classic in the making if the high production and story keep up.

Can't hardly wait for the second DVD.

Must Buy.",1262995200,,2486,4.495535714285714
3559342,5,B001F0TT1U,"The Emperor's younger son has been possessed by a water demon. Social norms demand that the Emperor kill his son, but in order to prevent the public from learning of the disgrace to the honor of the ruling family, he has assassins arrange for a fatal accident. The anime begins when a wandering female bodyguard named Balsa foils yet another  ""accident"". The Prince's mother knows what is going on and hires Balsa to protect her son.

The culture is similar to Japan's Heian Era (before the rise of the samurai as a distinct social class) but the two moons in the sky belies that. I have to say in all honesty that this is one of the best anime series that I have ever seen. For me it's as close to perfection as I am ever likely to experience. In fact I was so taken by it that I saw all 26 episodes in only 4 days. I don't think I've ever done that before. (Well, maybe the first time I saw Record of Lodoss War. It was so long ago, I'm not sure.) In terms of character, voice acting (Japanese---as a rule, I don't like dubs), story, action, animation, and BGM it is top-notch. Whether it is the sweep of natural vistas or the pomp and splendor of life at court, the visuals are stunning. It takes the time to develop the characters so that they feel like real people. Chagum, for example, grows from a pampered prince into a young man. One of the things I really like is that the story has no true villains. Even the assassins who are sent out to murder Balsa and her ward are behaving as their society dictates by being loyal to the Emperor. Even the ""bad guys"" have nobility of character. If Hayao Miyazaki were still making TV series, this is what they would be like. It has much in common with Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke. As much as I liked that movie, Moribito is better. It is directed by a young guy named Kamiyama Kenji, who also directed GITS-SAC I & II and GITS-SAC: Solid State Society. He's a protg of Oshii Mamoru and a director to be watched.",1252281600,,1961,4.311653116531165
3559343,5,B001F0TT1U,"This series is worth adding to anyone's anime collection. The quality of story telling, character design and story is better than 90% of what else is out there. Others have given their recaps of the story line. I just want to point out that this anime series accomplishes two unusual things. First, the action and fight sequences are increadibly well portrayed: fluid, dynamic and eye popping. It's all rendered in a way that recalls the very best of what we might expect from a great live action martial arts movie. Second, the civilization portrayed by the series feels like a real place. In the way that Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies made you feel as if Middle Earth was a real place, Moribito accomplishes the same thing. Science, superstition, magic, fate, art, ceremony, humdrum economics... it's all rendered in detail. The attention to detail and realism builds until you are completely engrossed. And with likable characters thrown in, you really can't lose with Moribito.",1245024000,,992,4.981927710843373
3559344,4,B001F0TT1U,"This is a fairly solid action/drama title. The first review gives you the basics of the story so I won't rehash that. Of the first four episodes only two feature really significant action, but it's good action. The animation quality is excellent and the story thus far seems more well thought out than many other anime shows. They do a wonderful job of keeping motion realistic, so the fighting is not only visually interesting, but intellectually interesting because it's close to being real.

This show does a very good job of staying away from the things that annoy me (and many other Americans) so much, such as extended pauses where people are simply looking at nothing, or the useless ""Uh!"" scenes (you know, where somebody says nothing but ""Uh!"" and nothing happens). It's not completely action packed, but things are going on that are essential to the story, even if it's not the main characters, so you don't feel like a single minute has been wasted. If you're the kind of person who can pay attention but hate shows that waste lots of time (like say, Naruto), you'll like this much better.

Furthermore, the animation is really clean. Top notch quality. You don't usually see stuff this good on tv shows. You may not want to buy the series in single dvds, but find some way to watch it. I'm pretty sure you'll like it.

By the way, this anime adapts the first novel of the ten novel series.",1224806400,,1401,4.618473895582329
3559345,5,B001F0TT1U,"What can I say about Guardian of the spirit that would truly let people know that it is no joke. Well to start it off, when I saw the first episode I got the same feeling I had when I saw the first episode of Cowboy Bebop. (Definitely Not Comparing The Two) but it just gave me that same feeling. It has that remarkable originality, beautiful animation, and a nice story that was a bit hard to predict at first. Nobody likes a flick they can predict right?

Moribito Guardian of The Spirit is about a traveling warrior named Balsa. Balsa starts out just looking for a blacksmith to fix her spear. Right here is when I'm thinking that a spear as her primary weapon may not add that spark to the action. Of course I was incredibly wrong. While on her Journey, Balsa saves a young prince from drowning. The prince's bodyguards don't exactly treat her as if she just did though. She gets away but is tracked down later, not without a fight though. The guards apologize and ask Balsa to come to the palace with them so she can be properly thanked.

The queen finds out that Balsa is actually a bodyguard. What the queen didn't know is that Balsa only guards people who remind her of past comrades that died. She wants to atone for her warriors life. She is asked to take the prince away and guard him forever. The boys own father is trying to kill him. Now Balsa and the young prince will embark on one long journey to escape the kings grasp. Can Balsa survive with the king sending such heavy weapons at her?

OK lets get it started, Balsa is an amazing character and one who has room to expand. A major problem with anime that tanks is that they lack good characters and good character development. Coyote Ragtime Show is one example of a series not have a dynamic main character. Balsa not only sparks the series but keeps good pacing as well. The big time supporting characters are slowly starting to show themselves but in good time.

I like that the villains are known but still hidden in a way at this moment but it should make for a good surprise to see the kings character in action. The animation is gorgeous, amazing fights sequences with great camera views to really get you into the series. The animation is very colorful and the character designs are on point. I loved the voice characters, especially Balsa's. I don't really know what else to say except this is one of the best anime I have seen in a while for sure. You gotta go get it, I have no worries but I doubt that this series can be messed up after having such a great beginning. So if you know me, you know I love good anime and I wouldn't give you a dud, this is a must have.",1221868800,,2646,4.307228915662651

8300321,5,B001F0TT1U,One of my favorite anime of the past decade.  Stage actress Anduki Mabou shines as the voice of Balsa.,1426809600,,102,4.368421052631579

8300323,5,B001F0TT1U,The menu is low quality but the episodes themselves are high quality. I love this anime and was very happy with the quality.,1408752000,,124,4.434782608695652

8300325,5,B001F0TT1U,this is a classic already and I hope it continues. This a good story about learning and who you are and what you can be. you can change. My kid already loves it.,1365033600,,161,3.909090909090909
8300326,5,B001F0TT1U,This is one of my favorite series.  It's based on a series of novels instead of the usual manga that inspire anime these days.  You can definitely tell as there is a good deal more character development and story complexity than you'll find in standard fare.  The fantasy world is well developed to the point where there are distinct cultures in the various countries explored throughout the series.  I highly recommend this one.,1364428800,,429,4.835616438356165
8300327,4,B001F0TT1U,The director even admitted that if done right the show would've lasted only 13 episodes in one of the extras inside! But I don't mind; since the trip still worked for the most part.,1362873600,,181,4.352941176470588
8300328,4,B001F0TT1U,"Don't let the 4 stars fool you. The series as a whole deserves 5. This is just the impression I was left with after watching volume 1. That changes greatly after the story developed. The story is about a wandering bodyguard for hire. Her name is Balsa. Balsa is out for atonement. She killed 8 people that were close to her. To repent, she has decided to save 8 lives of equal value. She nearly dies saving the life of Prince Chagum after he falls in a river. Chagum's father, The Emperor, wants him dead. Chagum harbors a water spirit that has supposedly caused a drought. The Princes Mother hires Balsa to take Chagum away and save him from the Emperor's murderous legions. They escape , but the enemy is hot on their trail. Will one woman be able to fight an entire Empire?

This series starts off kinda different. I wasn't sure if I would like it at first. The animation sort of took me off guard. I got accustomed to the different animation style and began to get really interested. It took about 4 episodes for the story to really start to shine, but it's great. It is pretty unique. If I had to give you a frame of reference, I think I would say that it's like a cross between Utawareumono and Princess Mononoke. As we all know, nothing is in the same league as Mononoke though.

The soundtrack, voice acting, and animation are all quite good. This series also has plenty of great characters, and a very good story with plenty of action and drama. I think that this is a pretty safe bet for just about any anime fan, no matter what genre you prefer. Just don't expect much comedy or fan service; this isn't Heaven's Lost property. It's Moribito, and it's definitely giving a look see.",1357776000,,1691,4.416666666666667
8300329,5,B001F0TT1U,I first caught a glimpse of this series years ago on Adult Swim. Its an engrossing and well done series. The animation is top notch. The story is intrigueing. I highly recomend this for the anime lover who also appreciates Lord of the Rings and stories of this nature. My ten year old nephew watched almost the entire series in one sitting.,1355702400,,340,4.5
