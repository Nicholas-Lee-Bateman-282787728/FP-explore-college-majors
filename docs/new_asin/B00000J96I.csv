Angelica Houston is just amazing - it's worth it just to watch Floyd Redcrow Westerman . . .

Its a beautiful and extra-sweet made-up story involving real life people in history, as 'Calamity Jane' narrates thru letters she is writing - can't say more - will spoil!!

Its a tear-jerker- comedy-drama all in one.",1458259200,,396,4.184210526315789

1231787,4,B00000J96I,"This movie, based on a Larry McMurtry book, is an interesting take on some well-known Western figures, exploring their personal lives and problems as the West that was wild becomes more tame.  The main characters are very well acted, and the costumes and settings are accurate to the time, except that Angelica Huston could never be as ugly as the original Calamity Jane.",1412985600,2,371,4.888888888888889

1231791,2,B00000J96I,"The movie steered too far from the book for my taste and the casting was all wrong; I think Angelica Huston is way too pretty to be Calamity Jane and while Gabriel Byrne's accent was convincing I thought Robert Duval would have been much better. And Liev Schreiber did not fit the picture I had in my head for Ogden, I think Bill Fagerbakke would have been a much better fit.",1388102400,,375,4.295774647887324

1231794,5,B00000J96I,"I read the book (by the great Larry McMurtry) first, and, while the movie isn't quite as good, it was still immensely entertaining. Great cast - especially Angelica Houston as Calamity Jane. The best part is when our heroes travel to London as part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Weirdness ensues! In many ways, this is a poignant elegy for the Old West, but with plenty of humor, excitement, and fun. Oh, and the scenery is spectacular.",1326585600,3,440,4.653846153846154

Some people say read the book by Larry McMurtry.  I'd rather read, ""The Comedy of Interaction in Human Relationships"" by Chester Isaiah Muncie.
Big effort by several people (in front of & behind the camera), but it seems awkward now and then as if nobody could agree on what was supposed to happen, so they left it up to the cutting room floor.  May have been too many egotistical divas and prima donnas sitting like a fat kid at the end of a chocolate candy assembly line with their mouth open.  There are historical inaccuracies, and some Hollywood liberties taken here and there, but overall the movie has entertainment value, even beyond the A-list cast.",1323043200,2,1717,5.538167938931298
1231796,5,B00000J96I,Angelica Houston is at her best in this movie.  Everyone did a great job.  Wish Sam Elliott had a bigger role.  This is one of the best westerns I have seen in a very long time.  Beautiful scenery!,1313798400,,197,4.105263157894737

1231798,5,B00000J96I,"I really don't understand all the bad reviews that I've read. I guess people just don't get it. I love this movie, and have watched it over and over again. My husband also loved this movie. Angelica Houston is the best Calamity Jayne I've ever seen. I'm not a big fan of Melanie Griffith, never thought she could act. But she is nice to look at, and plays her part as good as Melanie possible could. I love her costumes. This movie goes through some really fun history of Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jayne, and Annie Oakly, played by Reba McIntire. It's fun, it's realistic, and it's entertaining. I love the scenery. The film locations added much to the movie in my opinion. Angelica Houston seems to steal the show in this one. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good western.

1231802,4,B00000J96I,"A lot of ""poetic license"" was taken in making this movie about the historical Martha Jane Canary but it's still highly entertaining. So what if most of it didn't actually happen? That's why we go to the movies in the first place;to go into a fantasy world. Both Anjelica Houston and Melanie Griffith do superb acting jobs. Taken from yet another great novel by Larry McMurtry.",1204416000,,376,4.712121212121212
1231803,4,B00000J96I,"A good TV film. The main characteristic is typical of TV films or mini-series. It is slightly too slow and it concentrates too much on close up shots of characters or faces, and less on action, vast movements that the TV screen cannot capture. The story itself is based on the life of Bill Hicock and Calamity Jane, and of course Buffalo Bill. You can find them in Cody, South Dakota, with the Buffalo Bill museum, but also the Colt Museum and the Indian village Museum. You can visit the reconstituted western village composed of all cabins and houses recuperated everywhere in the west, and of course the cemetery with the tombs of Bill Hicock and Calamity Jane and a few others. You also have the rodeo ground and the old western saloon where some wild cowboys regularly organize some real true false holdups and gunfights in the street. This film is a commemoration of this period when the wild west turned into the not so wild west and pretty soon the no longer wild west. The film is trying to show this period and these characters from inside their psyches and it is pretty sure not to become over-sentimental. But it provides us with a picture of that wild west that is rather interesting and definitely human. The other side of the traditional western films with the guns, the fights, and the dishonest settlers or exploiters of settlers. And it is good to have that other vision, particularly with the women, and why they came to the west. But also the nostalgia that inhabited the minds of the pioneers, the trappers, the hunters and also, but far behind in this film, the Indians who were seeing a mode of living, a life style disappearing, and themselves along with it. The shortcoming at this level is that it did not explain enough the new world that was coming out of it, that was emerging.

1231808,5,B00000J96I,"the cast is just great and i'm an Anjelica Huston fan..i'm really 13 years old.but don't tell.i want to be an adult.

In the beginning of the movie Calamity Jane(Anjelica Huston)goes in the army then gets kicked out because--

Her love interest is Wild Bill Hickock(Sam Elliot).

She soon gets involved with him and does ""it"".Later her friend No Ears,they call him No Ears because he really doesn't have ears. Well anyways her friend No Ears tells her that she's pregnant,but she takes it like it's a very horrible thing. She couldn't belive that she was pregnant so she then is somehow happy,but not really.

Calamity is a very much a tomboy and after she has her baby then she relizes she doesn't know how to take care of the baby and has no where to live. So then she--

Her baby's name is Janey Canory.(that's Calmity's last name)

As she writes her child the letters sunddenly disappear. Weird uhh......

I can't tell you more because i'll ruin it.

it's a good movie,you should see it.

1231810,5,B00000J96I,"Buffalo Girls is one of the best made-for-tv movies from the 1990s and it is a pleasure to have this forever on DVD.

The film stars Anjelica Huston, Melanie Griffith, Peter Coyote, Sam Elliot, Gabriel Byrne, Liev Schrieber, Jack Palance, and Reba McEntire.  Even if the film hadn't been as well written as it was, the sheer star power of the film would have carried it through.

Huston plays Calamity Jane expertly with such emotion and understanding of the character.  Melanie Griffith was my favorite, however, playing ex-madame Dora DuFran, Calamity's best friend.  Her story is an emotional rollercoaster, and Griffith's incredible skills as an actress shine through here.  Sitcom star Reba McEntire plays Annie Oakley, and it's a shame that her role in the film is so small.  In the 3-hour film, she is maybe in it a total of fifteen minutes.  I think Reba is wonderful and it would have been nice to see more of her as Annie.  All in all, a great, involving movie that is a joy to experience.

The DVD from Platinum Disc Corporation has no extra features, but luckily presents the movie as it originally aired on TV, in two seperate parts.  The earlier VHS release had the two parts edited together into one long movie and had a scene edited out.  It's nice to have the Buffalo Girls in it's original form.  The picture quality is perfect and the sound is a robust 2-channel stereo track with surround seperation at very appropriate times in the film.

For the low price Amazon is offering this 3-hour DVD at, it is ridiculous not to buy it.  Even if you are not a fan of westerns (I certainly am not), it will still keep you entertained!",1109635200,40,1645,4.6048109965635735
1231811,5,B00000J96I,"I saw this movie re-aired on TV several years ago, and was thrilled to find it in video format. The cast of this movie was filled with superstars and familar faces in the movie world. Anjelica Huston's performance as Calamity Jane was amazing. She created an astounding depth of passion to this character, and the rest of the cast rose to her performance.

I love this movie because I enjoy Westerns, but prefer those with a feminine touch. The setting of the movie and the development of character is what makes this movie such a great Western. It has action and drama, but this is no ""B"" rated Western with gun fights, and chases on horseback. The heart of this movie is its heart and the human drama; set in the West with characters such as Calamity Jane, Annie Oakley, Buffalo Bill, and Wild Bill Hickok.",1101340800,5,808,4.534246575342466

The complite seris is here and the piture is much more clear than the VHS. The part where jane leaves for the boat is HERE. I love this seris even though it is not like the book. Melanie Griffith and Anjelica Huston are wonderful. The art work on the disk is beautiful and the case is as well.
