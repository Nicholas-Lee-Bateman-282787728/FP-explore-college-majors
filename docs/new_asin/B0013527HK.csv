3102133,4,B0013527HK,"The South Beach Diet Super Charged Workout is designed to help you burn more calories in less time. This is done with interval training. High intensity exercises are alternated with low intensity exercises. This means that there is quite a bit of jumping around. So I would only recommend this workout to people who consider themselves to be intermediate or advanced. Otherwise you will spend most of the time modifying the exercises - which is not difficult if you've done a ton of workout DVDs over the years.

Here is what you get on this DVD:

Cardio (21 minutes) - The workout starts with jumping and side steps and progresses to lunges, jumping rope and squats. I modified a lot of the exercises so they were not high impact.

Total Body Workouts:

Phase One (14:11 minutes) - A lot of the exercises in this workout are based on Pilates. There are also some belly dancing moves for your abs.

Phase Two (15:14 minutes) - This workout focuses on the bigger muscles from the waist down however there is still some time to do biceps with weights.

Phase Three (15:47) - I found this to be shoulder intensive. There is also some floor work for inner thighs. At the end of this workout I was saying...""yeah right"" because I could not do some of the exercises while flat on the floor on my stomach. Let's talk advanced Pilates. I modified those moves too.

The only caution I would give is that this may be hard on the knees and lower back. If you have any issues in those areas either you are going to have to modify everything or skip this altogether.

The exercises are illustrated, but it was still difficult for me to understand what I was being asked to do.

3102155,4,B0013527HK,"I purchased this DVD along side the Super Charged book, and also the Super Quick Cook Book. For the money, I have to say this is a very good workout. I have been on South Beach going on 2 weeks, faithfully utilizing the DVD workouts along side the diet. This workout is great for beginners; the low intensity work-up to the high intensity with short intervals in the cardio training, is helpful for any who are new to interval training or exercise in general. Having used the Insanity program in the past, I can attest that this incorporates a little bit of the same exercises used which was great for me; I wanted a workout that is effective after being sedentary for awhile, but I did not want to kill myself doing Insanity...(Just yet!)

All newer South Beach books recommend alternating between cardio and the phase workouts. I do cardio (20 minutes) on one day, and then Phase 1 & 2 (15 minutes each) the next. The book recommends that you do as little or as many phases as you are comfortable doing in each session. I absolutely love the way the stretches and free weight exercises make me feel!

The South Beach Super Charged DVD is definitely worth purchasing!",1361923200,,1168,4.557142857142857

3102168,2,B0013527HK,"I rented this from the library before purchasing it to see if it was for me.  I only have about 25 pounds to lose and have arthritis, especially in my knees.  I understand the concept of interval training and for this purpose, it is really good.  I was annoyed though, that the person on the back right, Lisa, was suppose to be the ""modifier"" for those who are not able to do the workout so easily at first.  Most DVD's (like Leslie Sansone), the modifier person, really does tone the moves down.  I found that throughout the dvd, she did the work out at full-tilt, almost more intense than the instructor/lead.  At one point, they had these side lunges with the knees and she was doing them full spread and deep (impossible for me).  The only thing modified was that she did not move her arms.  The arms for most people are not the problem!  I think I will stick with my Leslie Sansone dvd's and save my money.",1331337600,12,911,4.34319526627219
3102169,5,B0013527HK,Great seller! DVD arrived on time and was in great condition as described. I like the way the DVD offers a time clock that goes along with exercises. It shows how you pace the exercise which is very valuable. The exercise is not for someone who has been a couch potato.

It is a beautiful piece because it combines cardio, total body burns and athletic plies that challenges your body and helps the body posture each and every time.

3102174,5,B0013527HK,"I recently got this DVD and so far I love it.  I DO recommend watching the workout without participating before you begin.  I have bad knees and wobbly ankles so I watched it through first and realized some of the interval workout exercises I could not do.  When it comes time to do those I substitute activities of the same intensity in their place, for instance I can't do the jump-rope section for more than 15-20 seconds before I feel my ankles straining so when it gets to the longer jumping portions I switch to the high knee run.  I do lunges at a depth I can handle instead of jumping jack squats as well.  It is a good workout overall, I handle the core workout sessions much better than I thought I would though I'm still in the beginner phase using a chair.  The only thing I would change about it is the stretching after the interval training, I generally just switch it off and do my own stretches.  You definitely do want to stretch either with the video or on your own or your legs will hate you later.  I was a little worried about doing the work out after seeing all the reviews from people with knee issues, but either mine aren't as bad or they just aren't modifying like they should.  You can still do this workout with weak knees if your careful.  If you're not used to working out you definitely want to take it slower and maybe use a joint support supplement to help keep your remaining cartilage healthy, if you can't do the pill forms of glucosamine chrondroitin you should try joint juice.  If your just beginning your work out routine you want to double the daily dosage since you want to build more cartilage not just maintain it.",1299110400,6,1658,4.38562091503268

I first tried this out prior to purchasing it and after doing bout 10 workouts I started seeing a change in my body and it was more lean and starting to firm up. Even everyone around me noticed and made comments.  I think its the combination of cardio, muscle strength with the weight and pilates that helps give an over all workout. I have been working out for 10 years and after doing certain workouts I feel a certain way, well afer doing this workout I still feel the affects of it hours later and my resting heart rate is higher so I know I am burning way more calories hours later.

The SBD Supercharged DVD was a great workout, I was exhausted afterwards and that is exactly what I was looking for! The only thing I had a problem with was that there was a lot of jumping in the cardio section and it kind of hurt my knees and I'm only 21! There wasn't really any streching leading into the cardio, luckily I had just walked a mile before starting it but if I hadn't I could have possibly hurt my knees even more!
Along with the cardio I did select parts of the Phase 2 workout, mainly focusing on arms and abs and today I feel great! I can actually feel my ab muscles! It is a great workout just make sure to strech beforehand!",1223424000,3,773,4.0588235294117645

I have tried the South Beach parpard food from the grocery store but found some of them to be on the salty side and with this book you can add or subtract the amount of salt that you need.

Has options to do a ""cardio"" workout (20 minutes) and/or 3 different ""toning"" workouts (about 15 minutes each).  So you can do as little or as much as you'd like!

I agree with other reviews that the modifications for beginners are essentially non-existent.  Best suggestion is to just walk in place or something like that until you catch your breath.  The good news is, the more intense intervals don't last that long and you always get at least 15 seconds to recuperate in between.

3102202,4,B0013527HK,"I think it is a good dvd.  I will probably only use it when it is just too hot to get out or raining.  I think I would rather do the interval walking outside.  Also, the book wants you to work up to 3 sets of 8 with the ab and resistance workout, which the dvd does not do.  It is a good dvd and does all of the exercises in the book. I feel that you can't go wrong by purchasing it.  It is good to have for everyday or to use as an alternate to your regular plan.",1218585600,2,464,3.6
3102203,5,B0013527HK,"I have never enjoyed exercise, but I can tolerate it for about 15 minutes. When I read the new book, The South Beach Diet Supercharged, I was intrigued by the claim that I could lose weight faster by the right kind of interval exercise. Why not?

I was concerned that many of the exercises in the book seemed designed for human pretzels rather than those with back problems (like me). I decided to get the DVD and see if I could do the exercises.

Realize that the workout is only half of the South Beach Exercise plan. You alternate the workouts with walking days. Those walking programs are described in The South Beach Beach Diet Supercharged book.

There's good news and bad news.

The good news is that I was able to do the exercises just fine without injuring myself or getting bored. I've now finished 11 weeks, and I'm in maintenance mode on the exercise.

I gained a lot of fitness very quickly. I'm in better shape today than at any time since I was 21. It was very impressive to me.

My appearance gets lots of compliments. I look about 12 pounds lighter than I am.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that the workouts made me much hungrier than I usually am. My weight loss has really slowed down. I've only dropped five pounds in 11 weeks.

I suspect that part of the reason is that I've converted a lot of fat into muscle.

But if your reasons to go on a diet are to be healthier and to look better, this program works great.  But don't expect to look like a young Twiggy when you are done.

If you are a woman, you'll probably find this program tougher than I did.  My wife was moaning over the arm exercises which I found to be quite easy. She also found the walking harder than I did.

If you are a man, you'll be amused by the DVD's references to making your shoulders look pretty for a dress and directions to ""Get going, ladies.""

But whatever works is good.

I plan to stick with this exercise program and the diet.",1218499200,4,1941,4.291208791208791

3102205,3,B0013527HK,The South Beach Super Changed Workout is excellent especially when coupled with the South Beach Diet!  You only get out of it what you put in it!,1216857600,2,145,4.37037037037037
3102206,5,B0013527HK,"I love ""The South Beach Diet Super Charged Workout"". I believe using this video along with proper diet and attitude can help transform someone's life!  There are some areas that could be improved on this workout DVD. But because I feel it can be such a strong tool, I am giving it 5 stars.

""The South Beach Diet Super Charged Workout"" DVD is a supplement to ""The South Beach Diet Super Charged"" book but can be used as an exercise plan without using the diet. To achieve best results, reading the book is very helpful. The book explains in depth how to maximize fitness results with interval training and core conditioning performed in a short period of time. With this knowledge you can optimize your results with the DVD.

The DVD begins with an introduction from Dr. Agatston in which he explains that new research has shown how interval training in short durations can provide greater benefits than lengthy workouts.  The workouts follow the introduction. There is a 20 minute cardio interval training workout and 3 fifteen minute total body workouts to select from. In the book Dr. Agatston uses walking for the cardio training but gives alternatives. In the video the instructor varies exercises using simulated jump roping, lunges etc. Each burst is followed by a recovery period. For example you might do 30 seconds of jumping jacks followed by a 45 second recovery period of marching in place.  The 3 total body workouts follow the exercises given in the book and evolve in difficulty from Phase 1 to Phase 3. Agatston also suggests a leisurely walk of 15- 20 minutes on the days you do the total body workout.

What I love about the program is it is so doable. Not many of us can or want to spend a lot of time exercising, so short exercise with maximum results is very desirable. Also the variety of exercises keeps things moving and interesting. Instructor Kris Belding has an easy style that is motivating but not over the top. And if you ever do decide you don't want to listen to her an audio set up option on the DVD allows for music only. I also felt the exercises were very effective. I could really feel my core in Phase 1 and the interval training in the cardio section had me working hard but not so hard that I felt I needed to pass out on the couch!

As much as I love the DVD, there are a few issues with it. The biggest drawback on the DVD is the modifications for beginners. These are not well done. Beginners will have to work out their own modifications on some of these moves, because in some cases the modifications shown are high impact. In the jump rope interval, for example, the woman demonstrating the beginner modification is doing a full out side to side high impact hop/jump!  In the book Agatston starts you out on a Phase 1 cardio but on the DVD there is only one cardio choice that is at an intermediate fitness level. This may be to much for beginning exercisers. I think 3 cardio choice levels should have been included on the DVD.

Another critique of the DVD is the setting. It's a large room with a huge picture of the cover of ""The South Beach Diet Super Charged"" book on the wall. Ummmm, I think a beach setting or a prettier studio setting would be nice.

The DVD also has a bonus section which includes an interview with instructor Kris Belding, an overview of the library of South Beach diet books on the market and South Beach Diet tips to keep you on track.

Overall I have to say I love the DVD. It gets the job done in a short amount of time. Very energizing! Just keep in mind you may have to modify.

3336630,4,B0013527HK,"The South Beach Diet Super Charged Workout is designed to help you burn more calories in less time. This is done with interval training. High intensity exercises are alternated with low intensity exercises. This means that there is quite a bit of jumping around. So I would only recommend this workout to people who consider themselves to be intermediate or advanced. Otherwise you will spend most of the time modifying the exercises - which is not difficult if you've done a ton of workout DVDs over the years.

Here is what you get on this DVD:

Cardio (21 minutes) - The workout starts with jumping and side steps and progresses to lunges, jumping rope and squats. I modified a lot of the exercises so they were not high impact.

Total Body Workouts:

Phase One (14:11 minutes) - A lot of the exercises in this workout are based on Pilates. There are also some belly dancing moves for your abs.

Phase Two (15:14 minutes) - This workout focuses on the bigger muscles from the waist down however there is still some time to do biceps with weights.

Phase Three (15:47) - I found this to be shoulder intensive. There is also some floor work for inner thighs. At the end of this workout I was saying...""yeah right"" because I could not do some of the exercises while flat on the floor on my stomach. Let's talk advanced Pilates. I modified those moves too.

The only caution I would give is that this may be hard on the knees and lower back. If you have any issues in those areas either you are going to have to modify everything or skip this altogether.

3336652,4,B0013527HK,"I purchased this DVD along side the Super Charged book, and also the Super Quick Cook Book. For the money, I have to say this is a very good workout. I have been on South Beach going on 2 weeks, faithfully utilizing the DVD workouts along side the diet. This workout is great for beginners; the low intensity work-up to the high intensity with short intervals in the cardio training, is helpful for any who are new to interval training or exercise in general. Having used the Insanity program in the past, I can attest that this incorporates a little bit of the same exercises used which was great for me; I wanted a workout that is effective after being sedentary for awhile, but I did not want to kill myself doing Insanity...(Just yet!)

All newer South Beach books recommend alternating between cardio and the phase workouts. I do cardio (20 minutes) on one day, and then Phase 1 & 2 (15 minutes each) the next. The book recommends that you do as little or as many phases as you are comfortable doing in each session. I absolutely love the way the stretches and free weight exercises make me feel!

I understand the concept of interval training and for this purpose, it is really good.  I was annoyed though, that the person on the back right, Lisa, was suppose to be the ""modifier"" for those who are not able to do the workout so easily at first.  Most DVD's (like Leslie Sansone), the modifier person, really does tone the moves down.  I found that throughout the dvd, she did the work out at full-tilt, almost more intense than the instructor/lead.  At one point, they had these side lunges with the knees and she was doing them full spread and deep (impossible for me).  The only thing modified was that she did not move her arms.  The arms for most people are not the problem!  I think I will stick with my Leslie Sansone dvd's and save my money.",1331337600,12,911,4.34319526627219

3336671,5,B0013527HK,"I recently got this DVD and so far I love it.  I DO recommend watching the workout without participating before you begin.  I have bad knees and wobbly ankles so I watched it through first and realized some of the interval workout exercises I could not do.  When it comes time to do those I substitute activities of the same intensity in their place, for instance I can't do the jump-rope section for more than 15-20 seconds before I feel my ankles straining so when it gets to the longer jumping portions I switch to the high knee run.  I do lunges at a depth I can handle instead of jumping jack squats as well.  It is a good workout overall, I handle the core workout sessions much better than I thought I would though I'm still in the beginner phase using a chair.  The only thing I would change about it is the stretching after the interval training, I generally just switch it off and do my own stretches.  You definitely do want to stretch either with the video or on your own or your legs will hate you later.  I was a little worried about doing the work out after seeing all the reviews from people with knee issues, but either mine aren't as bad or they just aren't modifying like they should.  You can still do this workout with weak knees if your careful.  If you're not used to working out you definitely want to take it slower and maybe use a joint support supplement to help keep your remaining cartilage healthy, if you can't do the pill forms of glucosamine chrondroitin you should try joint juice.  If your just beginning your work out routine you want to double the daily dosage since you want to build more cartilage not just maintain it.",1299110400,6,1658,4.38562091503268

There wasn't really any streching leading into the cardio, luckily I had just walked a mile before starting it but if I hadn't I could have possibly hurt my knees even more!

I agree with other reviews that the modifications for beginners are essentially non-existent.  Best suggestion is to just walk in place or something like that until you catch your breath.  The good news is, the more intense intervals don't last that long and you always get at least 15 seconds to recuperate in between.

I was concerned that many of the exercises in the book seemed designed for human pretzels rather than those with back problems (like me). I decided to get the DVD and see if I could do the exercises.

Realize that the workout is only half of the South Beach Exercise plan. You alternate the workouts with walking days. Those walking programs are described in The South Beach Beach Diet Supercharged book.

There's good news and bad news.

The good news is that I was able to do the exercises just fine without injuring myself or getting bored. I've now finished 11 weeks, and I'm in maintenance mode on the exercise.

I gained a lot of fitness very quickly. I'm in better shape today than at any time since I was 21. It was very impressive to me.

My appearance gets lots of compliments. I look about 12 pounds lighter than I am.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that the workouts made me much hungrier than I usually am. My weight loss has really slowed down. I've only dropped five pounds in 11 weeks.

I suspect that part of the reason is that I've converted a lot of fat into muscle.

But if your reasons to go on a diet are to be healthier and to look better, this program works great.  But don't expect to look like a young Twiggy when you are done.

If you are a woman, you'll probably find this program tougher than I did.  My wife was moaning over the arm exercises which I found to be quite easy. She also found the walking harder than I did.

If you are a man, you'll be amused by the DVD's references to making your shoulders look pretty for a dress and directions to ""Get going, ladies.""

But whatever works is good.

I plan to stick with this exercise program and the diet.",1218499200,4,1941,4.291208791208791
3336701,5,B0013527HK,I am loving the workout -- it is a total workout but as strenuous as you want it to be.  The 15 minutes increments are great too.,1218067200,,129,3.7777777777777777
3336702,3,B0013527HK,The South Beach Super Changed Workout is excellent especially when coupled with the South Beach Diet!  You only get out of it what you put in it!,1216857600,2,145,4.37037037037037
3336703,5,B0013527HK,"I love ""The South Beach Diet Super Charged Workout"". I believe using this video along with proper diet and attitude can help transform someone's life!  There are some areas that could be improved on this workout DVD. But because I feel it can be such a strong tool, I am giving it 5 stars.

""The South Beach Diet Super Charged Workout"" DVD is a supplement to ""The South Beach Diet Super Charged"" book but can be used as an exercise plan without using the diet. To achieve best results, reading the book is very helpful. The book explains in depth how to maximize fitness results with interval training and core conditioning performed in a short period of time. With this knowledge you can optimize your results with the DVD.

The DVD begins with an introduction from Dr. Agatston in which he explains that new research has shown how interval training in short durations can provide greater benefits than lengthy workouts.  The workouts follow the introduction. There is a 20 minute cardio interval training workout and 3 fifteen minute total body workouts to select from. In the book Dr. Agatston uses walking for the cardio training but gives alternatives. In the video the instructor varies exercises using simulated jump roping, lunges etc. Each burst is followed by a recovery period. For example you might do 30 seconds of jumping jacks followed by a 45 second recovery period of marching in place.  The 3 total body workouts follow the exercises given in the book and evolve in difficulty from Phase 1 to Phase 3. Agatston also suggests a leisurely walk of 15- 20 minutes on the days you do the total body workout.

What I love about the program is it is so doable. Not many of us can or want to spend a lot of time exercising, so short exercise with maximum results is very desirable. Also the variety of exercises keeps things moving and interesting. Instructor Kris Belding has an easy style that is motivating but not over the top. And if you ever do decide you don't want to listen to her an audio set up option on the DVD allows for music only. I also felt the exercises were very effective. I could really feel my core in Phase 1 and the interval training in the cardio section had me working hard but not so hard that I felt I needed to pass out on the couch!

As much as I love the DVD, there are a few issues with it. The biggest drawback on the DVD is the modifications for beginners. These are not well done. Beginners will have to work out their own modifications on some of these moves, because in some cases the modifications shown are high impact. In the jump rope interval, for example, the woman demonstrating the beginner modification is doing a full out side to side high impact hop/jump!  In the book Agatston starts you out on a Phase 1 cardio but on the DVD there is only one cardio choice that is at an intermediate fitness level. This may be to much for beginning exercisers. I think 3 cardio choice levels should have been included on the DVD.

Another critique of the DVD is the setting. It's a large room with a huge picture of the cover of ""The South Beach Diet Super Charged"" book on the wall. Ummmm, I think a beach setting or a prettier studio setting would be nice.

The DVD also has a bonus section which includes an interview with instructor Kris Belding, an overview of the library of South Beach diet books on the market and South Beach Diet tips to keep you on track.

Overall I have to say I love the DVD. It gets the job done in a short amount of time. Very energizing! Just keep in mind you may have to modify.

It addresses people in any level of fitness and offers training to increase your own personal fitness performance.  I like that it will ""kick start"" those of us who may have found ourselves on a stubborn weight plateau.  It's gratitfying to see your own personal progress as you work through the sections that almost kill you one week and after a few weeks of training become much more managable and even fun.  You will definately feel the ""burn"" with these training DVDs.  I don't have time to go to a gym and I appreciate that I can get a good workout on my own time schedule without added expense and equipment.",1213315200,7,708,4.457364341085271

The Supercharged book gives me an overview for eating healthy foods with carbs that are naturally satisfying verses my previous intake of unhealthy carbs that caused uncontrolled cravings and appetite. Now I eat healthier foods that satisfy my appetite, resulting in intake of smaller portions. Since learning about interval training in the Supercharged book, I am motivated to exercise daily since just a half hour of interval exercise produces a noticeable effect on my energy and shape. The SBD and exercise plan are very doable and have greatly improved my health and fitness.",1213315200,4,645,5.09433962264151

8249217,1,B0013527HK,Was looking for an easier way to incorporate the exercises described in the book into my routine and this is not it.  The routine didn't seem to match the book at all.  Found the instructors movements hard to follow and the movements were not well explained.  Hard to believe they expect people to be able to do the total body moves on Phase 1.  If you have any physical issue at all you are out of luck.  The camera didn't spend enough time on the modifier to be useful in the total body workout and the person being filmed didn't do anything differently in the cardio section so if you can't start off doing the unmodified version you can't complete the exercises which is very frustrating.,1484438400,,692,4.4603174603174605
