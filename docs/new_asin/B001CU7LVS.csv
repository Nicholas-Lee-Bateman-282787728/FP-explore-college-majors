8289320,5,B001CU7LVS,"This film, then only on VHS, was my first introduction to Nolan's Cross back in 2001. When I watched it I immediately observed that the cross probably could be half of a Tree of Life, thereby combining a Jewish and a Christian symbol. And I kept on going ever since. Fun to be part of a new film (History is part-owned by A&E), presenting my theory in the episode called ""The Secret of Solomon's Temple"" of The Curse of Oak Island. The old A&E film is a valuable document with its interview with Fred Nolan. There aren't many around. He has made the most important discovery on the island after the original Money Pit was found in 1795.",1392336000,10,636,4.398305084745763
8289321,2,B001CU7LVS,"Only 45 minutes long.  However, they did manage to squeeze in all of the popular history and theories, even one I had not heard.  I didn't feel it was very well done and somewhat skimpy on details.  Still, it probably should be viewed by Oak Island Money Pit fans as another piece of the puzzle.  But, it's definitely not worth price they are charging.",1392076800,3,352,4.453125
