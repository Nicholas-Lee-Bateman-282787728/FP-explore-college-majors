8299223,4,B001EP35WA,"My copy seemed to have volume control problems with the Intro; A young Mary, (A superb horse woman, by the way, even as a Nun) galloping across the countryside to an excerpt from Gounod's ""Mass of Ste Cecile"". The documentary-style story is well presented - at least the main points, but seems to end rather abruptly with her death in 1909. One minute she's walking around, the next, there she is in a coffin!  In reality, she was ill for several years, yet still managed to continue her work after a massive stroke, teaching herself to write with her left hand! And, for animal lovers, there was no sign of her little Terrier from whom she found comfort in her last years. Having attended one of her schools (St. Joseph's Russell St. Adelaide) It was a happy experience seeing St. Mary's story being told at last.
Should be of interest to Believers and the curios alike.",1398729600,,871,4.583333333333333
8299224,3,B001EP35WA,"""Mary Mackillop' is a recent Australian production about the Catholic luminary Mary Mackillop (1842-1909) a Sister of Saint Joseph's who beautified by Pope John Paul II in 1995 making her Austraila's first saint. Beloved for her tireless efforts to help educate the poor and underprivileged she fought long and hard against the ""Powers That Be"" which included her own church from which she was excommunicated and exiled. It certainly seems that a pre-requisite to sainthood always begins with condemnation from the Catholic establishment doesn't it?

If you're expecting this to play like a feature film you will be disappointed. It is presented in documentary style with live-action sequences interrupted with interviews of contemporary Catholic religious and church historians discussing Mary, her accomplishments and the impact of her life on the Church and the people she served. Lucy Bell is well cast in the role of this rather obscure saint and the format works well giving the audience a more than adequate glimpse into the life and accomplishments of Mary Mackillop.

Enjoyable watch geared primarily for the Catholic devout and those fascinated with the subject of sainthood. If the subject matter is not of interest to you neither will this film.",1222214400,4,1257,5.28
