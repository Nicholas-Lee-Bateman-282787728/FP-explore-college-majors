2727644,5,B000M9BPJO,"I could have done without the nothing-to-do-with-the-D80 ""how to be a photographer"" section at the start of the DVD. However, it is short and bothered me less on a second viewing.

This DVD expands on the manual by providing some idea as to why you might want to change a camera setting or use some feature. I watch a DVD or read a book for this. Most manuals, including the D80's, limit themselves to what there is, not why. Maybe that is what another reviewer referred to as, ""how to"" rather than ""how it is"". It is what I seek and I found it in this Blue Crane DVD; more so on a second viewing.

This is a fast way to become familiar with the D80's settings and features. It does a good job of spending time on the most important ones. For example, focusing settings and features are covered in detail while the D80's retouching features are just touched on.

2727645,4,B000M9BPJO,"This DVD on getting better results from your Nikon D80 is a good source of information and useful pointers and tips.  As is pointed out in the video, the manual tells you how the camera operates, not how you should use it.  What I have to say next should not be taken to mean that this video isn't useful, only that it could be better, and that not everything it passes on should be accepted without thought.

The first thing I noticed was that when the camera is not on the speaker the sound quality changes - this was disconcerting until I got used to it.  In any case, it seems unnecessary.

It is stated that the flash indicator in the view finder tells you if the built-in flash is ready.  No reference is made to the possibility of an external flash.  They could just as easily have said that the indicator tells you when the flash is ready, rather than ""the built-in flash.""

The assertion is made that [r06] in the view finder tells you the number of exposures that can be taken in continuous shooting mode (for your picture size and quality settings).  This is grossly wrong, it tells you the remaining buffer capacity.  Since the buffer is simultaneously being filled and emptied while you are shooting you can certainly take more than, say, six or nine pictures before the camera needs to slow down.

In chapter 12, it is stated that you need to shoot at least as fast as the reciprocal of the focal length of the lens when holding the camera in your hands.  This is a D80 with a ""DX"" sensor that's only two thirds the size of a 35mm frame.  It would, therefore, be advisable to shoot 1.5 times faster than the rule used for film cameras.  For example, with a 100mm lens you might try 1/150 sec or faster, not 1/100.  The warning in the video, however, that the rule starts to break down at 300mm and longer seems to be valuable information.  The suggestion that when a tripod is used you should use the self timer or custom setting 31 to impose a delay after pushing the shutter release seems necessary only for certain shutter speeds, and no mention was made about Nikon's nifty little IR remote shutter release (it works great over a considerable distance).

In chapter 14, it is stated that the ISO button can be pressed and the command dial rotated to change the ISO setting.  This only works for the four manual shooting programs, a critical fact not mentioned. For the preprogrammed modes, ISO can be controlled only from the menu system.

In chapter 15, it was stated that ""RAW images store 12 bits of data for each pixel instead of 8 bits for JPEG,"" and, ""this may be most important for high contrast images.""  In the first place, the difference is between 12 and 8 bits per color channel for each pixel (i.e. 36 and 24 bits per pixel), and this can be important in low contrast images where posterization might be evident.  The general rule involved is that if you wind up doing any major adjustments to brightness, contrast, gamma, etc. you may need those extra bits of data.

In chapter 16, when showing examples of the rule of thirds, it seems that one of the example images was replaced by solid black background with superimposed white lines.  Also, in talking about where to place the horizon in an image, the rule is given - ""Never allow the horizon line to cross the exact center.""  OK, in general, but if you are using a wide angle lens tilting the camera can introduce very noticeable distortion.  You just might want to keep the camera back vertical and crop the image in your computer.  Cropping is a lot easier than correcting for distortion.  Later in this chapter, there is a discussion of lens selection (concerning focal length) in relation to the geometry of a subject to the background.  The specific example is for portraiture, but without a warning that a short focal length lens can result in the camera being brought too close to the subject with very unflattering distortion of facial features.  Also, since many users will consider taking pictures of people to be a major use of their D80, I would have expected a word about softening the focus.

In chapter 17, the discussion about color temperature will not make a student of physics happy.  ""degrees Kelvin"" and ""degrees centigrade"" are not the same, and the concept of color temperature is not tied to the element carbon.  There are a few other gaffes concerning color temperature, but I'll just add that the discussion on selecting white balance and fine tuning it only applies to the four manual shooting modes.  The failure to mention this could lead the unsuspecting into a very frustrating experience.  (See next paragraph.)

Early in the video, it is asserted that the ""Auto"" mode will produce average results, and that the other preprogrammed modes will result in improvement, but still near to average results.  Too bad they didn't come right out and say that all of the discussion and instruction to follow was geared to the use of the four manual modes only.

To end this, let me add that chapter 20 on exposure metering seemed very well done and useful.",1179446400,55,5064,4.592880978865406
2727646,5,B000M9BPJO,great dvd. i learned so much. this is much better than trying to read the owners manual.,1179014400,3,88,4.235294117647059
2727647,4,B000M9BPJO,"All in all a good product and it would be a good investment for those that want more than they can get from web sites and the Nikon manual.  Where it falls a little short is in the lack of practical applications of the product.  Needed a little more ""how to"" rather than ""how it is"".  For instance, the D80 has a very good feature called Auto ISO and it would have been helpful to have more practical information on how to use that feature with Aperature Priority, Shutter Priority, etc.  Instead it seemed like the book was a cut a paste of most of the stuff that was from the D70 manual with a little on the new D80 material.",1176249600,9,627,4.1570247933884295
2727648,5,B000M9BPJO,I purchased this DVD at the same time I purchased my D80. I am familiar with film photography having used a Nikon FM2 for years. This DVD was a tremendous help in learning the specific functions of the D80. But don't expect to watch it once and absorb it all. I've watched it twice now and will probably benefit even more from multiple viewings as I become more familiar with my new camera. The only thing I might add is that the DVD states it is for beginners through intermediate photographers. If I was a true beginner I really think I'd be quite lost with this DVD. But the beauty of the DVD is that you can rewind and replay as often as you like! And it's really about the functions and capabilities of the D80 -- it's not a DVD about photography. Well worth the money. I'd certainly recommend it.,1170633600,36,802,4.317880794701987

8167329,3,B000M9BPJO,This is a helpful guide to familiarize you with the operating system of the Nikon D80.  A visual learning tool to reinforce the applications.  This camera has so many bells and whistles to utilize that you just have to practice by using each step outlined and then apply them to your photography before moving to the next step.  Also a good review if you have not used your camera recently.,1319068800,,390,4.542857142857143
8167330,4,B000M9BPJO,"The Blue Crane Nikon D80 Training Video is a superb learning tool.  While it does not replace the handbook that came with the camera, it is an excellent adjunct to it.  In easy to follow instructions, the video takes one through the more complex operations of the D90...and serves as an easy-to-use reference tool.  I like mine so much I gave one to a friend.",1299456000,2,359,4.492307692307692
8167331,5,B000M9BPJO,"I purchased this DVD for my wife who has recently upgraded from a compact digital camera. It primarily covers the use of the four manual modes on the camera as apposed to the camreas automatic settings. We have found it to be very informative in this respect and alot easier to follow than the Nikon manual that came with the camera. Combined with the other tips in the DVD,eg one third composition technique, it has helped her alot.
It states on the Amazon site that this is a North American region DVD but we have had no problems playing it here in New Zealand.",1258156800,2,563,4.423076923076923
