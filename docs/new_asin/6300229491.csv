266042,4,6300229491,"I figured this movie was gonna be pure cheese, but it was actually alright.  Paula is a mega-spoiled rich girl who acts all prim and proper but is actually a hard-livin' hoodlum who, along with her all girl gang, rob gas stations, molest boys at gun point (off camera), steal, vandalize the school, kill a cop and throw wild pajama parties.

Written by the great Ed Wood, Jr. THE VIOLENT YEARS would have been much better if it was also directed by him instead of William Morgan who's closet claim to fame was being the editor on SONG OF THE SOUTH, which by the way was a good movie.",1123545600,7,583,4.339449541284404
266043,4,6300229491,"You know, I think The Violent Years is actually a pretty decent film, despite its over handed commentary on the whole juvenile delinquency craze that swept through Hollywood in the 1950s.  It's hard to believe, but filmmakers actually used to make films with messages, exhorting viewers to straighten up and fly right - or else, this could happen to you: kids with no respect for anyone, committing crimes just for the kicks, man, etc.  Of course, the effectiveness of such movies can be called into question - but more on that below.

As for the film, witness one stone-faced young blonde with impeccable sweater-wearing skills and a lust for thrills.  She leads a gang of buxom hooligans on a crime spree that escalates from gas station holdups to a physical attack on a young man (probably the highlight of the poor dope's entire life, truth be told) to fencing stolen goods to Communist-inspired vandalism to murder.  Poor Paula Parkins (Jean Morehead) has been forced to grow up with rich parents who don't spend enough time with her, always out working or organizing charity events.  Naturally, she has to rebel - and her parents, despite all of their money, are somehow incapable of buying a clue.  Paula is a bad, bad girl, and it's only a matter of time before she discovers why living dangerously is in fact dangerous.

I could go into all the crimes they stuff into this one film, but that doesn't get to the heart of this movie.  The whole point of The Violent Years is to lay the blame for juvenile delinquency squarely on the parents.  Certainly, Paula's parents share some of the blame for their daughter's actions, since they were always too busy to talk to her or make sure she was really the good girl they thought her to be, but The Violent Years pins all the blame on Ma and Pa.  Weren't these films targeted at young audiences?  What good did it do to lay all blame for juvenile delinquency on the parents?  Sure, judge, I robbed that store and shot a man in cold blood - but we all know I'm not to blame; it was those rotten parents of mine.  Fortunately, Paula does pay the price for her crimes in this film, but she never takes responsibility for her own actions.

Well, maybe the big ending will help convince all those kids in the audience not to make juvenile delinquents out of themselves, even if they have bad parents.  Uh, no - it doesn't.  What you get is an exceedingly long and boring speech from a judge whose monotone could put kids to sleep by the thousands on the night before Christmas.  As it turns out, none other than Ed Wood wrote the script for The Violent Years, and that does a lot to explain the judge's big speech at the end, which has him mandating a return to God and the rehabilitation of the whole woodshed industry.  It's a good and valid message, but the excessive moralizing and seemingly endless length of the whole speech robs it of any real effectiveness.

To sum up, I think The Violent Years is a pretty good, albeit campy, film with an important message, but I think the message is directed at the wrong audience and thus fails to accomplish its obvious goal of curbing juvenile delinquency.",1109376000,,3152,4.564831261101244
266044,4,6300229491,"""The Violent Years"" is a camp classic with the emphasis on the camp.  This 1956 film scripted by the legendary bad movie director Ed Wood (the film is actually directed by William Morgan) begins with four young hellions walking disdainfully by a blackboard on which the rules of propriety have been written.  Meanwhile, a narrator intones: ""This is a story of violence, of violence born in the uncontrolled passions of adolescent youth and fostered by this generation of parents, those who, in their own smug little world of selfish interests and confused ideas of parental supervision, refuse to believe today's glaring headlines.""  There is Georgia (Theresa Hancock), Geraldine (Joanne Cangi), Phyllis (Gloria Farr), and the leader of the pack, Paula Parkins (Jean Moorhead).  Paula's parents are too busy to have heart to hearts with their little girl anymore and so she and the other gals start up a gang so they can rob gas stations, attacks young men at Lover's Lane, and mainly having as much fun as they can on the road to Hell.

Now, as you have come to expect with any film bearing the Ed Wood label, the dialogue is horrible, the acting is nonexistent, and the lecture the judge gives Paula's parents at the end of the film is an absolute hoot, all of which speaks to the appeal of this film.  It is so bad that you keep munching on the popcorn through all the pajama parties, heavy petting, murder, mayhem, dope rings, and the baby born in jail to keep your jaw from laying on the floor.  On this Rhino video the 70-minute film is sandwiched by the commentary of former teenage thrill kitten Mamie Van Doren (star of such classics as ""Untamed Youth,"" ""High School Confidential,"" and ""Girls Town"") who makes a series of lame jokes.  But the theme songs for ""Teenage Theater,"" which both starts and ends the tape, sets the stage for this camp classic and gets you in the proper mood.  This is not a first tier Ed Wood film but it is still enjoyably bad and you can make up your own crude jokes and barbs even if, like me, you missed this particular turkey on ""MST3K.""",1056067200,9,2077,4.622282608695652
266045,1,6300229491,"If Ed Wood had directed this film, as well as scripted it, the movie might have been a jd version of Jail Bait.  But, alas, the direction is merely mediocre and thus doesn't rise to the top of the pond.  The plot is stagnant and the dialogue so dry that any breath of camp would have evaporated in the actors' scowling mouths!",1033948800,4,326,4.241935483870968
266046,4,6300229491,"Pajama parties, heavy petting, murder, mayhem, the mob, dope rings and illegitimate babies born behind bars. Ed Wood was way before his time. He was the original Jerry Springer. I am a firm believer that flicks like this must be reviewed by fans of the genre, because let's face it - who else would want to watch them? For you fans, this one is a keeper, in a hilarious ""Reefer Madness"" sort of way. The plot is typical Wood fare and the actors struggle bravely to keep up with the speed of the film running through the camera. Rich spoiled babes stick up gas stations, rip the clothes off good gals and force rich guys to do their bidding. I wonder which part of Ed's brain brought this premise to paper. It's one of those ""do you know where your children are?"" horror stories. I give this debacle four stars because despite the subject manner, lack of decent actors, script, props and...for that matter...plot...Ed Wood followed his dream.  He got his films made. So you ""roughie"" and ""thrill kitten"" fans, give this a whirl. Everyone else should run quickly in the opposite direction.",998006400,15,1087,4.632124352331606
266047,5,6300229491,"This is my all-time fave film to laugh at. The  thing is, it's NOT a comedy; it's a deadly serious ""cautionary tale"" about parents ignoring their  children, who as a result turn to delinquency and the  ramifications for everyone around.  For this film alone, Ed Wood Jr (who  wrote the screenplay but did not direct it) deserves to be remembered.",960336000,7,346,4.7

Cool features.

7806839,2,6300229491,"Ed Wood's name is synonymous for bad movies. It's not that he didn't try or even that all of them were intentionally bad. But most of them ended up that way with his film PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE being hailed as one of the worst movies ever made. But Wood had a passion for film (and for cross dressing in angora sweaters) that pushed him to make movies in whatever way possible.

And so it is that AGFA (American Genre Film Archive) is now releasing THE VIOLENT YEARS to blu-ray. AGFA is making a name for themselves releasing movies that are not on the most watched list, not on the most wanted list and not on the best movie ever made list. What they've done is saved movies that have a historic value to film lovers, restoring them and offering them in the best format possible. It doesn't matter if the movie is a stinker, all movies deserve to be preserved for history's sake if nothing else. And in the end there is a certain fan base out there who will clamor to pick up a film like this, reveling in just how bad it is.

The story here, as in most Wood films, is fairly flimsy. Paula Parkins is the once bright and shining teen who, due to neglect and no attention from her parents, turns down the wrong path. She leads a pack of degenerate girls into a gang doing things like robbing a gas station, pajama party orgies (if you can call them that) and eventually murder. If it weren't for the bad writing and terrible dialogue you might think this was one of those government films from the 50s warning of the dangers of girl gangs. Instead it's just a low budget movie that was probably a filler at some point.

Just to be clear Woods didn't direct this film. Instead he was the writer on the film and that dialogue I spoke of becomes clear with each second of film that runs on screen. With such memorable lines as ""I shot a cop. So what!"" be read by actors in need of acting lessons it's easy to see why this film garners laughs today.

If that weren't enough there's a second feature on this disc as well. Count them, two for the price of one! What a bargain! Well it would be if it were a good movie. Instead it's another movie along the same lines as the first. This time though we have a young man whose brother is a condemned killer sent to the electric chair causing him to seek vengeance on those who sent him there. More bad acting, bad dialogue and weak production values makes this a perfect companion piece to the main feature.

To show the dedication AGFA has for movies like this consider the extras and work put into this release starting with the fact this is a 4k scan from the original 35mm camera negative. You'll also get a commentary track with filmmaker Frank Henenlotter and Ed Wood biographer Rudolph Grey, a collection of trailers from Something Weird, a memorabilia scrapbook and more.

The honest truth is that most will not want to add this to their collection let alone watch the movie. But from a historical aspect it does make for a somewhat interesting viewing. Fans of all things Ed Wood will not want to pass this one by. Lovers of bad movies will want to have it on hand as well. All others be warned in advance.",1518480000,,3157,4.324324324324325
7806840,3,6300229491,"The Violent Years is a tale of good girls gone bad. Made in the 1956 by legendary low-budget filmmaker Ed Wood, the film focuses on Paula Perkins (Jean Moorehead) and her gang of girls who get their kicks sticking up gas stations, engaging in wild pajama parties, trashing their school, molesting men and cold-blooded murder.

The film, meant to be an expose of juvenile delinquency and the dangers of cigarettes, alcohol, and making out with older guys, gets the full Wood treatment with its impossibly awkward dialogue, tight-sweatered cuties, wooden acting, and choppy editing. If Wood didn't invent the term camp, his movies fall perfectly into the definition. In films such as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and his dubious masterpiece, Plan 9 From Outer Space, Wood put together stories with minuscule budgets, controversial subject matter, and terrible, but enthusiastic, acting.

The Violent Years is fun mostly because Wood actually managed to get the film made. He was determined, enthusiastic, and wouldnt be stopped by trivialities like lack of money, talent, and a coherent screenwriter. Wood wrote the script for The Violent Years which is filled with complex sentences that no one ever speaks in the real world. The sheer artifice  of the dialogue is one of the films joys, as well as one of its dopiest ingredients. The final scene features a didactic speech from a judge in which he lengthily lectures about the perils of heading down the wrong path in life.

Ed Woods films are an acquired taste. They are usually so bad, they are entertaining. Though not as awful as Plan 9, The Violent Years provides many jaw-dropping moments.

Bonus materials on the Blu-ray release include commentary track with filmmaker Frank Henenlotter and Ed Wood biographer Rudolph Grey; trailers from the Something Weird vault; memorabilia scrapbook; and the movie Anatomy of a Psycho (1961), starring Ronnie Burns (son of George Burns and Gracie Allen).",1511308800,6,1957,5.103125

7806844,5,6300229491,"It's been awhile since I've written a review, but what better way to get back into the swing of things than with a movie so bad it's hilariously entertaining. When I saw the cover to the DVD featuring the chick with the tight sweater and torpedo mammaries I was interested, when I turned it over and saw the name ""Ed Wood"", I was sold. I knew I was in for a treat.

This film is inept and terrible, but as entertaining as a decent film. That was the genious of Ed Wood. Most bad movies are a chore to sit through, but Ed's movies are even worse than the worst of bad movies, but you cannot stop watching, laughing, and enjoying yourself. The Violent Years will never reach the levels of Plan 9 from Outer Space, but this is a damn fine film if you are an Ed Wood fan.

Paula is a 25 year old teenager who doesn't get any attention from her parents. Her father is so busy running his newspaper that he can only get poor Paula a brand new watch for her birthday year after year!! And her mother is so wrapped up in her charity work that she never has time for mother/daughter heart to heart chats. So what is a poor teenage girl in 1956 supposed to do? Naturally she starts up a gang and goes on a crime spree.

They stick up gas stations, force girls to strip off their pretty sweaters at gunpoint, and rape men at lovers lane. But the grand finale of their crime spree is a hoot that must be seen to be believed.

They have a 'contact' who has a 'contact' that will pay good money for school vandalism. Why you ask? Paula asks also which is the most intelligent thing she does throughout the movie. The contact tells her never mind and not to ask questions. This is good advice for this film, don't ask questions, just go with it. So off they go to their high school to take revenge on their hated teacher and get paid for doing it.

Well classroom destruction in 1956 is a little different than the Columbine massacre. One girl actually ERASES the blackboard! The horror!! Desks are overturned as well, and the teachers desk calandar is ripped in half. Oh the humanity! After a window is broken (the horror), the cops show up and a shootout ensues. The cops are out on the street hiding behind their police cars firing at the girls who are returning fire from the classroom. One girl is shot and has a final line so unforgettable and stupid you'll find yourself hitting the << button just to hear it again. Another girl gets shot outside during their escape. But watch how this escape goes. The girls are moving so slow and they are practically right in front of the cops when they get in their car! They even drive their car right past the cops and the getaway car passes by the parked cop car by inches. It is so ridiculous you'll laugh your hiney off and wonder if there was a way the scene could possibly be worse!

Of course everyone who gets shot never has a bullet hole in their clothes, a drop of blood spilled, or even a look of pain on their faces.

Well poor Paula is actually pregnant (and unmarried! The HORROR!!!!) She dies in childbirth and the baby becomes a ward of the state.

One of the unsung highlights of this film is the judge. His mundane speeches that could never actually be spoken by a human being in real life will have you rolling with laughter. ""My old friend, it is hard to judge an old friend, espescially when he is an old friend....""",1261353600,2,3368,4.284591194968553

Yes, this is a camp classic with wonderfully absurd scenarios, fabulous fifties outfits, dated homilies, ridiculous dialogue and plenty of sex and rock 'n roll.  The film is so bad it's laughable and the situations are totally unbelievable.  But for those of you planning on buying the DVD, cave canem!  Buyer'd best beware because the quality of the film is terrible -- it's a faded black and white and the images are about as sharp as a butter knife.  This is obviously an image recorded off a projection screen so anyone who really is a film buff, don't buy this DVD no matter how cheap it is!  Even the sound quality sucks!  OK, the lines are priceless and the hackneyed moralizing may be worth $2.99, $8.99,  or whatever it costs. But be prepared for an extremely low quality film.",1211673600,2,938,5.4206896551724135
7806847,1,6300229491,"Four teenage girls, who are well into their twenties, disguise themselves as boys (they wear bandannas) and ""run rampage"" through the city by pushing their sexual advances on a weaselly boy on Lovers' Lane and hitting a gas station employee with a handgun, not killing him of course, but, as one policeman remarks, ""Not for lack of trying.""

After enduring a friend of her father's who shows up at their slumber party, trying to hold a conversation with the ""teens"" as they make out robotically, Paula leads the gang on their most heinous crime of all:  breaking into their classroom in order to slightly disrupt the furniture and even erase the blackboard! Fortunately, the cops show up before they can finish the job, and a shoot-out ensues.  One of the girls, after being blasted with a shotgun, announces, ""It wasn't supposed to be like this,"" before lying down gently with no visible signs of damage whatsoever.  After running out of the school, the girls stop directly in front of the cops and chat long enough for another girl to be shot down as well.  Day and night lose all meaning as the remaining two girls speed off at a snail's pace past the police.

After another shooting, the girls have a wonderfully ridiculous car crash into a plate glass window.  One of the girls dies in the wreck.  Paula receives some cuts on her face, but manages to live just long enough to give birth to her illegitimate child.  A judge refuses to grant Paula's parents custody of the child and further punishes them by reading a speech so long and pointless that even he seems to be dozing off by the end.  In short, it's the fault of the parents that Paula turned to crime as a hobby because they didn't give her enough love or force religion upon her.  Let this be a lesson to us all.

""The Violent Years"" isn't nearly as inept as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or ""Glen or Glenda"" (possibly because Ed Wood only wrote it, didn't direct it) but it's still terribly entertaining.",1172448000,6,1967,4.572649572649572
