2696514,4,B000KN7D5W,"With the 2012-2013 it's been a great time to watch old hockey footage on DVD. I purchased this DVD when it wasn't widely available. Because there weren't too many copies around, I paid a little more, but I don't regret it.
The script on this and just about all videos of this sort is pretty bad, but that's not the reason we watch -- we watch for the sport, and there's a lot of great hockey here. At almost 2 hours running time you're watching hockey most of the time, it's not overrun by reminiscences, but that is a big part of it. While I personally find the scripted part embarrassingly awful -- it's predictable, cliche kind of stuff and that makes it easy enough to tune out -- the comments from veteran players are much appreciated. It's also just fun to see so many of these guys again after so many years.
Most of these guys will tell you Bobby Orr is the best there ever was. They may very well be right. The greats all bring something a little different and Orr left a big-time stamp on the game. Some die-hard fans may think of a highlight or two that is not included, but make no mistake, there is some amazing footage collected here and the video really does bring together ""the Best of Bobby Orr.""",1356998400,2,1213,4.324561403508772
2696515,5,B000KN7D5W,"This is one incredible DVD!  Just to see Bobby Orr skate and work his magic again is amazing.  To see all the Big Bad Bruins again - Esposito, Bucyk, Sanderson - brings back all the great memories of Boston's Golden Age of Hockey.  I consider this a must-see for all Bruins fans; as well of all fans of hockey.  I can't get enough of this DVD - highly recommended.",1334534400,9,364,4.231884057971015
2696516,4,B000KN7D5W,"There's much by way of talking from his peers, management and from #4 himself, but the chatter don't make it boring. Esposito and company shed light on the playing reality of their day and make it pretty durn clear that Orr was way better than anybody else. If they don't convince you, let the footage convince you. There's a lot of classic NHL footage of Orr that you just can't get anywheres else.

To use the parlance of our times: This guy was sick.",1331596800,6,453,4.392857142857143

8158289,5,B000KN7D5W,"I bought this as a gift for my dad as he was always an avid Bobby Orr fan, and as a child he and I watched ""the goal"" together. When we bought this for his Christmas gift, it was better than all of his other ones combined, and he's shared it all over work with his friends. Well worth the buy!!
