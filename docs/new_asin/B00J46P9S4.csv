8647904,5,B00J46P9S4,"Just when you think there is nothing new in horror, something comes along and grabs you. Axed is a separate breed of dark comedy, I call dark slasher comedy. This include scenes you find yourself laughing at, yet embarrassed that you do so.

Kurt ((Jonathan Hansler), a somewhat prudish man just got the ax at work. I like the small details Driscoll works into the scene. At a beautifully laid out breakfast table, Kurt picks up and looks at a burnt toaster waffle. Having just been fired at work, Kurt decides to have a surprise family day taking everyone into the country. As they pass school, Kurt informs them of his plans.

His daughter Megan says, ""This isn't funny.""

Dad replies, ""I wouldn't say that."" A little hint the writer tosses at us that this was meant to be a very dark comedy.

Dad has issues with his family. His son Jay (Christopher Rithin) isn't manly enough and gets bullied. His daughter Megan (Nicola Posener) isn't modest enough. His wife Steph (Andrea Gordon) has been having an affair with his boss Zack Peterson (Henry Douthwaite).

Kurt has a nasty little surprise for them all as he gathers them together .

Jonathan Hansler reminded me a bit of John Cleese in his role (what Brit doesn't). The ending dragged on a tad after a great beginning.

F-bomb, sex?, no nudity (Nicola Posener bra/cleavage) Clearly a film not for everyone.",1431993600,,1361,4.69327731092437
