1172949,5,9089707255,"I have bought and used several treadmill work out videos and these from the Ambient
Collection are head and shoulders above the others!! They are beautifully done, clear,
clean, bright pictures. You can actually wrap your head around the walks and almost
believe that you are walking a path in this great scenery. There is no way that I
could recommend them more highly!!! I have a couple of them and will eventually buy
more.",1378598400,13,426,4.693333333333333

7901517,5,9089707255,"In this DVD you can see beautiful autumn landscapes in the mountains of Spain and France. I really like the first walk. Here you walk on a small mountain road and in the background you can see the snow-capped mountains and the beautiful blue sky. In walk two everything is very quiet, you can hear the ringing of the cowbells and see some houses that are typical there. Walk three is also very impressive, everything can be seen in autumnal colors, whether trees or meadows, only the blue sky contrasts with the orange colors. A very impressive DVD, exercising with the treadmill is great fun.",1445126400,,593,4.6571428571428575

7901520,5,9089707255,"Gorgeous autumn country/mountain scenery!  I use these walks with my mini InMotion elliptical trainer or if my legs are too tired from that, I just jog in place. The pace is a brisk walk / light jog. It would suit a leisurely ride on a stationary bike too. Only nature sounds from the area (no music). Great production quality!!!",1408492800,,329,4.576271186440678
7901521,1,9089707255,"Very disappointing. I bought this to view when using my exercise bicycle. The scenery is lovely, but each walk lasts less than 30 minutes and has many edits. One walk on one of these ""Virtual Walks"" was 22 minutes long and had 14 scene changes. I did the math - that gave me an average of 1.57 minutes per scene. Most other walks had at least 6 or more edits. What were they thinking? Just as I was beginning to feel I was really cycling along that road, an edit would have me heading a different direction in another area of the region. NO, NO, NO!. If I truly was riding a bike on that road, I wouldn't be magically transported elsewhere. As a former professional videotape editor for television news, I say LET THE SHOT ROLL. Since the speed is about 6 miles and hour, find a gorgeous area 3 miles long and LET THE SHOT ROLL. No edits!

My ideal cycling video: 30 or more UNEDITED minutes of a gorgeous view - preferably with no cars, people, buildings or billboards. Then offer it in blu ray. (After many years working with videotape, I love, love love, HD and blu ray).",1407801600,5,1074,4.316831683168317
7901522,5,9089707255,Good for getting your mind off the pain of walking.,1406073600,,51,4.2
7901523,4,9089707255,"This is a beautiful mountain walk.  I wish I could give it a 4.5 stars.  The scenery is exquisite.  The only two concerns I have (and I feel bad even writing these) is that I wish you could follow the trail to the end, rather than ""page turn editing"" (which makes things feel a bit random.)  It's fun to learn the nuances of a trail and following trails to the end gives one a sense of accomplishment.

The only other thing I'd add is the ability to look off to the side every so often.  People rarely walk with blinders on and it's nice to look down a ravine or out towards a valley.  By doing so, it helps give the viewer a sense of perspective and makes the hike feel ""real.""

I wholeheartedly thank the filmmaker for this generous mountain footage and for bringing it to life on dvd.  I love it.  A++",1394150400,12,804,4.162337662337662
