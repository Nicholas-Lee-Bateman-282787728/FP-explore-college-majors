8311734,2,B001J20GYS,"This isn't really what I was expecting. I wouldn't title this learn bharatanatyam because it doesn't seem to be teaching, it is more of a teacher with two performers, unless this is meant for very advanced users. if you want a performance then this is a good dvd. I wish the description had been better.",1426291200,,303,4.527272727272727
8311735,4,B001J20GYS,"I am not learning the performance of Bharatanatyam but after spending several weeks in South India and seeing live  performances, I wanted to appreciate the skills of this artform. I have purchased all four volumes of this series and have found them very useful for this purpose. Being a retired teacher I can appreciate her method of instuction which has made me understand the strict discipline which her pupils must adhere to and which have given me a deeper understanding of this artform.
 These four volumes will be played by me many times in the future. I do not speak Tamil but have needed the internet to fuuly appreciate hand gestures and the order of pieces in a complete performance. I wish her students the best for the future.
 The only drawback was that three of the four volumes were shorter than advertised so that these four volumes could have been put onto two.",1398902400,,879,4.694805194805195
8311736,1,B001J20GYS,"With all due respects to the teacher, I was excited to buy this item but was disappointed when I got to review this. Everything is so I complete in the video, it's good to watch but will not advise anyone to buy this, it definitely does not help anyone at all, but will only give you an introduction to the dance style, no continuity!",1353024000,,334,4.234375
8311737,5,B001J20GYS,"Srimati Srekala is such a sharing and giving teacher and a renowned dancer. In this program of adavus, she teaches four different steps of importance- jumping, sliding, diagonal moving, and ending. Her explanations are very thorough, her hand gestures (mudras) so perfect. Her students who demonstrate are already professionals, very talented, fit, showing signs of having learned from an authentic teacher.

Srekala performs solo a skilled dance with music in Sankarabharanam. She has all the 10 required skills of an accomplished Bharatanatyam artist. She is agile, strong and yet delicate, her steps are fast and swift as needed, and most of all, the emotions she expresses really reveal the story told in the song. The choreography is well-thought out and put together.

Srekala is unique.",1345766400,4,793,5.336
8311738,1,B001J20GYS,"DVD is of poor quality. DVD player is not able to play it but I can play it on my desktop, probably format issue. Video is good for kids who wants to learn BharataNatyam.",1320537600,,170,4.029411764705882
8311739,4,B001J20GYS,I purchased this DVD for my children when their teacher was temporarily unavailable to teach.  I find the video to be very informative and is an excellend learning resource to anyone who lives far from a Bharatanatyam instructor.,1260230400,13,229,5.026315789473684
