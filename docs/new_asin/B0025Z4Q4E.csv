3850119,5,B0025Z4Q4E,Ballerina is a wonderful inside look at the dedication that these dancers must have to attain success.  My neice is a 13 year old aspiring dancer so I mailed this to her.  She loves it and watches it over and over and I plan on buying her more movies like this.  The women portrayed are real dancers and the stories focus on their personal lives as well as professional.  If you appreciate that ballet is more than just another kind of dance you can't help but love it too.,1257897600,,473,4.280898876404494
3850120,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"For years during the Soviet era, the Kirov ballet was the premiere, and most guarded company in the world.  Many dancers defected to the ""West"" while on tour.  Now that the USSR has been torn apart we are allowed to see, and film, many ""sacred cows"" of the Soviet era.  This film focuses on five girls whose desire is to rise up the ranks from student to prima ballerina in the mighty Kirov Ballet company.  It is a fascinating look into just how much work, practice, attention to detail (in one clip a dance-master tells an 18 year-old who's just danced her first performance as Odette/Odile (the female lead) in ""Swan Lake"" that her arms and hands were not placed correctly). This is immediately after the final curtain, the dancer is still in costume and holding bouquets of flowers!  Fascinating rehearsal coverage and private interviews interlace with performance footage to make this one of the most interesting documentaries I've seen.  Well worth the money, and, by the way, ballet ""haters"" will enjoy it, too.",1257033600,4,1018,4.82183908045977
3850121,4,B0025Z4Q4E,"This documentary is a suitable companion piece to the old Soviet era ""The Children of Theater Street"" and a welcome antidote to Hollywood's depictions of the life and training of professional dancers.  Any university or college that has a dance program or dance team should buy this for the fine arts media collection.",1256256000,13,318,5.0
3850122,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"A wonderful documentary following some of the most talented ballerinas of today. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is pursuing a career in ballet, or who is a fan of ballet. 5 stars for me!",1255910400,,203,4.368421052631579
3850123,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"This movie is a jewel from ballet world! It is a documentary that can move those who are or were in any way related to ballet, as it captures the inside story of this fascinating and challenging art form and profession, presents lovelly personal stories of several young Russian ballerinas and allows us to enjoy segments of most popular and beautiful classical ballets...The film that is as nice, touching and educating for young people who chose this path, as much as captivating for those that simply love and enjoy classical ballet and music. My own reasons were of personal nature; as somebody whose late mother was a ballerina and has installed the love for ballet in me, I found it to be beautiful and honest, personal, professional and very moving ! It is so nice to see and hear the ""behind the scene"" of a life that shows it's glory and perfection in a theater performance, but in meantime it takes years of dedication, hard work and sacrifice to get there... The movie presents its full magic and lets us appreciate how somebody can be taken under ballet's spell for life... Magic of dance and music that enriched my mother's life and through her, mine, too...",1255392000,3,1171,4.689320388349515

3850125,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"You don't have to be enamored of Russian ballet to be struck by its beauty, by the intense years of dedication and hard work (to say nothing of innate talent) it takes to succeed in the rarified air of the Mariinsky or the Bolshoi.

This excellent new documentary takes you behind the scenes at the world-renowned Vaganova Academy in St. Petersburg, the guardian of Russian classical ballet (see Russian Life, Nov/Dec 2008). It traces the lives and fortunes of a handful of ballerinas in training, following recent graduates through their first years of service in the Mariinsky, while comparing their careers with those of world-renowned primas. In all, it is an astoundingly intimate, up-close portrait of these dancers' lives.

One of the most unexpectedly fascinating parts of the film, however, is when the cameras turn to interview a leading dancer from Paris. His declaration of the unparalleled toughness and grit of Russian dancers is insightful as only the judgement of one's peers can be. (As reviewed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russian-Life/dp/B00008CQIB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russian Life</a>)",1247097600,51,1162,5.7894736842105265
3850126,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"This is the best ballet documentary I have ever seen on the Kirov. It is almost a sequel to ""The Children of Theater Street."" The Kirov has taken its history and technique and brought it into the modern arena - even the leotards and tights are like amazing costumes from Karinska. These women have incredible technique and artistry - each one very different from the last. They are current and yet old fashioned, in a good way, at the same time. If you're a dancer - you'll love this because its is filled with behind the scenes, rehearsals, class, and life in the reality of being a Russian dancer. Interesting perspective on performance scenes as well.",1244592000,94,654,4.646551724137931
3850127,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"There are a lot of short, beautiful clips of ballet by some of the world's greatest dancers. They're even more interesting when put into context with the many interviews by these dancers and their teachers and trainers. There is a lot of emphasis on how difficult the profession is but also how much the dancers love it. ( The narrator speaks English but most of the dancers speak Russian so there are subtitles.) It's one of my favorite films.
P.S. I ran into Ulyana Lopatkina on the street when I visited St. Petersburg and she's just as lovely in real life as she is on the dvd.",1433376000,4,581,4.4392523364485985

This video gives a close up of the Ballerina's long hard road to the stage. Very well done.",1401580800,,173,4.8
3850134,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"I've watched it thrice and find this documentary absolutely mesmerizing. I grew up in the era of the great male dancers and really have never had the opportunity to see contemporary women dancers of this caliber.

This film follows five Russian ballerinas at the Mariinsky [ formerly the Kirov] at different stages of their careers from first year student to prima and demonstrates  the selection and training they undergo even before the enter the corps. The documentary also shows the back story and daily routines of the five young women, who are so charming and unspoiled, as they discuss their lives and training, hopes and dreams.

Their styles and personalities are, of course,  reflected in their work- and the rehearsals and staged productions are fascinating to watch. The performances of the fiery Diana Vishneva and the cool, near perfect Ulyana Lopatkina are enthralling, while the charm and warmth of Yevgenia Obraztsova and the two younger girls is captivating .  Highly recommended for lovers of ballet.",1400371200,,1019,5.151515151515151
3850135,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"This was available for streaming on Netflix.  I watched it about a million times until they put it on to DVD only.
I hope some of the proceeds of purchases make their way to the dancers and dance companies.
I've been a hobby dancer for many years.  I am so inspired by watching these young dancers bloom.

3850139,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"This excellent film takes a close look at four Russian Ballet Dancers: Zakharova (now with  the Bolshoi) Lopatkina (the now Prima Ballerina of the Mariinsky Theatre) and two then young and coming future ballerinas: Somova and Obratzova (this last one now also with the Bolshoi Ballet).This film shows the incredible amount of talent, studying, guidance and dedication that is required for a female dancer to reach the rank of ballerina. This is the highest level achieved in a great  company, and not a generic term. This film proves why",1370736000,,537,5.022471910112359

3850141,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"This is a beautiful film on what it takes to be a Kirov Ballet ballerina. It features 5 dancers - one young one in her final year of ballet school and first year in the Corps at the Kirov, another a year ahead of her who is beginning to get her first solos, and then 3 prima ballerinas - one seasoned, one newer, and one returning from a 2-year injury recovery and maternity break. All are shown both training and dancing, and if you love to watch ballet you will be in heaven watching this. They are all interviewed as well, and talk about the hard work and their relationship to dance - what it means to them emotionally, and what kind of dancing they would like to do in the future. There are also interview clips from the ballet directors and teachers.

Some of the dance scenes are just exquisite. My favorite was actually not a stage scene, but one in which one of the prima ballerinas practices moves from Swan Lake in silence, with the light shining in a window behind her. It is amazing.

I will say though that this is not in the least bit critical, so in that sense is more of a promotional documentary than a probing one. There isn't any attempt to show the underside of ballet - no eating disorders, back-stabbing, or injuries shown here. The one ballerina is returning from an injury, but that's about it. Also, all of the ballerinas featured are successful, none are featured whose careers have stagnated, or who have been forced to leave the company. There is mention of this happening, and of the hard work involved, but otherwise, it's more a celebration of accomplishment than investigative.

That's fine with me, as a celebration of these beautiful dancers is more than entertainment in my eyes. So as long as that is what you are looking for, you will love this film.",1359590400,2,1788,4.495384615384616
3850142,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"From the opening scene of beautiful St. Petersberg in winter, with Tchaikovsky's
""Winter Dreams"" symphony in the sound track, I was mesmerized. I have little
knowledge of ballet but am quite familiar with symphonic music. I found this
documentary enchanting and educational. There were brief snips from about eight ballets.
I like that they noted the composer and the the choreographer on each snip.
This is an excellent dvd for ballet novices. Experts in the field may prefer more
detail and analysis but most viewers should enjoy this. It inspired me to begin
attending live performances and to educate myself about the art form. This film
is almost at the level of the Ballet Russe film.",1326585600,9,690,4.956896551724138
3850143,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"This film is both enchanting and enlightening.  How wonderful to be able to witness the Kirov dancers as they are today.  For so many years, while it was a great company it seemed rather a museum piece.  They have definitely entered the 21st century!!  The film bears watching and rewatching.  The dancers are delightful.",1320624000,,321,4.87037037037037

3850146,4,B0025Z4Q4E,"I was expecting more, but this might be because of having just bought 'The Dancer' which is a much more in intimate experience, behind the scenes. I loved the cross-section of truly talented ballerinas that were featured. I wish there had been more backstage, warming up moments. And I'd also wished their had been more scenes dancing. The ballerinas talked a little more than I'd liked. Dance is best explained thru watching dance. That said, I've watched 5x since I got it two weeks ago, so it does fulfill the ballerina 'fix' when you need one. I'm glad I bought it. I do absolutely love the ballerinas in it. I love how when a ballerina takes off her toe shoes and just walks down the street you can't tell what a tower of strength and determination she is, she seems just like a regular girl.... it's like having a super-power. Lovely women, all.",1299974400,9,851,4.568627450980392

Great contrast to the movie 'Etoiles' and the more recent 'La Danse', also documentaries but of the Paris Opera Ballet.  This one looks at individual dancers and focuses only a little on the school or company, showing perspectives from different points of a dancers career.  The dancers talk a lot throughout the movie and it's interesting to hear them speak about their lives and careers, but I just enjoyed the scenes of them dancing, learning, performing.  You really get a look at the hard work involved in making this art form look effortless.",1270598400,6,610,4.836538461538462

3850151,5,B0025Z4Q4E,"Let me start by saying that I am not a ballet afficianado.  However, this documentary was stunning.  It offers a very detailed look at the Russian ballet.  Most notably the Kirov (Mariinsky Theatre) and it's history of ballet, though it does show a brief segment on the Vaganova Academy.  It chronicles several aspiring Prima Ballerinas, Alina Somova and Evgenia Obratzsova.  These 2 girls are lovely, absolutely lovely to watch.  My 3 young daughters and I were captivated, even though it was in English subtitles.  We enjoyed the ballet class glimpses, the rehearsals and clips of stage performances.  Also featured were Zvetlana Zakhorova, Diana VIshneva and Uliana Lopatkina, 3 of Russia's most popular ballerinas.  They were breathtaking.  Uliana had just decided to return to ballet after taking a 2 year absence and on the DVD we saw her working hard to make a successful comeback.  Which of course she did.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this documentary.  We completely enjoyed every moment and have watched it numerous times.  It runs 77 minutes but the time seems to fly by.  Definitely worth the money!  We recently saw Alina Somova perform in the Sleeping Beauty ballet and it was completely delightful to see the accomplished ballerina she is now compared to the young girl she was when this doucmentary was filmed!",1266883200,23,1341,5.027272727272727

Only those who already have an intense interest in Russian classical dance will get much of a lift out of ""Ballerina,"" a well-meaning but pedestrian behind-the-scenes portrait of five promising members of the Kirov Ballet Company.  Through interviews, rehearsal footage, and snippets of actual stage performances, this 76-minute film, written and directed by Bertrand Norman and narrated by Diane Baker, gives us some sense of the discipline, dedication and physical stamina required of any woman who hopes to succeed in this field - women who, in some cases, can go on to achieve near-rock-star status in their home country.

What the movie lacks is any real means of making the material come alive for those with little or no interest in ballet.  Contrast that with ""Ballets Russes,"" a far superior documentary that truly does provide a fascinating look at not only some of the premier dancers of all time but the long and distinguished history of ballet itself.

These young Russian women are all in elite ballet schools and we follow them as they dance at the Maryinsky Theatre, one of the greatest dance companies. not only don't get deprive body and soul from sustenance, their emotional well being is always in a constant flux. Criticized daily they strive for the best. The five young women were pucked because of their talent, and this film reveals very little of their lives, only the ballet lives. I was interested in their diet or lack thereof, how many hours a day are they practicing, do they have boyfriends, do they have family support. One young woman took two years off because of an ankle injury, she married and had a child. Now, she is back dancing again. Do they make a lot if money or is it only the prestige. So many questions, so few answers.

This film feels lind a setup from the Russians. The women speak in Russian with English subtitles.  Not enough substance, but an overview.
