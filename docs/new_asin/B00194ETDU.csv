It's hard to find good Latin dance routines that hold my interest for very long, and this is a keeper.",1353801600,,264,4.479166666666667
8271849,4,B00194ETDU,"Carlos' DVD is ecellent and has more than one workout program so you can start off slow with the introduction and move into more advanced and complicated steps.  I have tried it and will love it after I improve.  Right now I am using Elise's Video to learn from.
Can't wait to really learn Carlos' moves as it is a great workout and a lot of fun.  I highly recommend it.  I am spoiled with the great music my Latin teacher at the YMCA classes use.  Have not been able to find a workout for home that compares with her music.  The music Carlos uses is okay, better than just drums.",1258156800,,580,4.18018018018018
8271850,4,B00194ETDU,"If you want a workout that doesn't dwell long on explanation but gets you moving right away and keeps you going, this is it. Carlos' presentation is very straight forward - going through he first segement of a routine on a slow beat, speeding it up, adding the next segment etc.  One routine moves straight to the next.  You never feel like you have to always wait through the ""learning"" segment to get to the cardio segment.  The Abs workout in a good one focusing on ""core"".  There are two pre-set routines, each a little over 40 minutes.  Carlos just does the routines, there is no cutesy chat to endure and the music makes you want to move.  I really enjoy this DVD.",1233792000,3,670,4.40650406504065
8271851,5,B00194ETDU,"OMG - how much fun is this? Admittedly, it doesn't make me sweat like a Cathe workout, but it put me in the best mood for the rest of the day. Wow! I'm not particularly talented with dance workouts, but I was able to follow this one quite well the first time through. Carlos is an excellent instructor. As I'm getting more familiar with the routine I'm looking forward to adding more high-impact moves. There is also an ab section, short but good and different. Excellent DVD!",1228953600,5,476,4.482758620689655
