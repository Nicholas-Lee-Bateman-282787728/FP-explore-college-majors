699295,4,6303579345,"Saw this strange and enchanting film in the theatre upon its release.  From the moment I saw the Caption, ""Blackpool by the Sea"" - superimposed over a wide shot of the city - I knew I had to visit there. Just returned from a week-long visit in June - my third since 2000.  Oddly enough, the people of Blackpool are not all that different from those depicted in the film.  Many are quirky, offbeat and super friendly.  Have watched the VHS tape many times and still laugh at the variety of brilliant comic set pieces, particularly the ""audition montage.""  Many heartfelt moments in this picture.  Just learned of the DVD, which I will purchase immediately.
Thank you Peter C. for making this little gem!",1062806400,4,702,4.620967741935484

Lee Evans is a genius, the screenplay is tremulous with psychological insight and artistic vision. You'll never think of John Lee Hooker's ""Boogie Chillun"" the same way again.

How I loved this film, one of the edgiest, darkest comedies I've ever seen. No opportunity is lost: the idea of a black comedy is driven home, from its setting (Blackpool, England) to its music (James Brown, Duke Ellington, John Lee Hooker...). There is a very dry wit, and a wonderfully executed display of human frailty, while we watch Oliver Platt's character try to figure out how to resuscitate his career in comedy. Then-newcomer Lee Evans adds a terrific element, as the questionable partner whose sanity is always under suspicion, and Jerry Lewis, as Platt's father, does a great job in derailing Platt's career and finally jolting him.  I love this movie, in a way I love very few movies.",1060560000,5,699,4.776859504132231

It sounds like a linear plot, but it took a long time for me to figure out what was going on. There are a lot of very strange things that happen at the beginning, and one scene made me dream of amputations that night.

When he should've stayed wide. I can't believe that he wrote a fine script but as a director of his own words. He was a stinker!,  2) The Director of Photography can light a shot but that was about it. HORRIBLE camera work. 3) The editing was way off. The opening scene should have been cut in half. Some of the gags like the pissing on the crooked cops leg. We needed to see this to get the gag. Hey! If you are going to steal from CHEECH & CHONG then do it right. Jerry Lewis and Oliver Platt and the rest of the cast were great. Time should have been spent on Oliver Reed. his gay gangster role was wasted. Jerry is always great and plays it straight. Should have hired a good storyboard artist first.

FUNNY BONES: Tommy Fawkes (Platt), 35, is the son of ""America's Funnyman,"" ""Mr. Originality,"" George Fawkes (Lewis). But as a comic, Tommy's a total bomb. He wants it badly enough, but he just hasn't inherited his father's ""funny bones."" After a humiliating flop in his Vegas debut, he heads for Blackpool, England, a seaside resort that boasts of being the birthplace of British vaudeville--and the place where young Tommy collected his most cherished childhood memories. He hires an agent to parade local ""talent"" before him, in the hopes of discovering and buying the performance rights to a unique and hilarious physical comedy act.

On a parallel track, young Jack Parker (Evans), Blackpool's certified city maniac and son of England's most obscure comedy team, is trying to get his own act into a club--but no club will hire him since...the incident. In flashback, we see the terrible tragedy that befell him as a young circus clown-in-training. (Jack's also on the lam from dishonest cops and a group of Frenchmen who... Oh, it's just too complicated.)

Their lives intersect (or, more precisely, collide) when Tommy sees the one act that floats his boat: Jack's. But when he sees Jack's dad and uncle, the legendary ""Parker Brothers,"" perform, he witnesses more than he bargained for. As clues and memories and confessions fall into place, Tommy realizes his attraction to their acts indicates that this collection of funny bones is taking the shape of a skeleton in his family's closet...

Discussion: ""I never saw anything funny that wasn't terrible, that didn't cause pain,"" Tom Parker confesses to George Fawkes. One theory of comedy says that it springs from pain--and what could be more painful than a crisis of sanity, or a spiritual crisis? And by applying this philosophical logic, couldn't the greatest pain then yield the greatest humor? To put it another way, comedy is a serious business. ""Funny Bones"" knows this and interweaves high drama and low comedy with seamless skill.

The performances, first off, are first rate. The pudgy, intense Platt seems dangerously close to breaking into a ranting tantrum even when playing panic, and Jerry Lewis has never done better work (which you can interpret any way you wish). The real standouts are the Brits, however. Carl and Davis as ""The Parker Brothers"" are wonderfully funny, and Evans is a true buffoon: a rubber-faced alien; a `toon in loony goon's clothing.

As for the slapstick routines in the film, I am reminded of reading ""The World According to Garp"" in the late 1970s. The fictional character Garp is described as a brilliant writer, and John Irving takes a courageous gamble to clinch this description by including a story ""written"" by him. If the story were brilliant, we'd have proof of Irving's claims. But if the story were anything less than amazing, the character (and therefore the entire novel) would have lost all credibility instantly. In ""Funny Bones,"" if the comedy routines did not live up their legendary status, the entire film would flop for lack of credibility. Luckily for us, they do prove the claims of the characters, and are laugh-out-loud funny.

The complex plot is strewn with red herrings, like the mysterious giant wax eggs, containing a mysteriouser rejuvenating powder sought by the mysterioust Reed character--a bit of magical realism that merely garnishes the central stories. Plot twists that seem immanent and inevitable never occur, and the slowly unfolding story of the two families, connected by more than just karmic comedy, tells tales of trust and betrayal, lust and larceny, professional success and personal tragedy. And the incredibly original ending is simultaneously a bittersweet story of salvation and dangerous, cutting-edge comedy. Like the films of Hal Hartley (specifically ""Trust,"" ""The Unbelievable Truth""), ""Funny Bones"" dances on a razor-thin tightrope between comedy and tragedy, where even the slightest gesture could nudge the entire film right off the rope. It's a hilariously liberating film: You'll laugh, you'll cry--and you'll laugh while you cry.

Let me state this unequivocally: ""Funny Bones"" is unique; an original; a work of cinematic and philosophic brilliance; a hilariously serious film about the spiritually redemptive power of comedy. I urge you most strongly to see this singular cinematic masterpiece if you're funny, or suspect you're funny--or wonder why you aren't.",1422489600,,4682,5.135170603674541

With a fantastic cast, this film is an homage to old vaudeville comedy acts, leavened with a family drama and a grown son's coming of age, all wrapped in a bizarre crime story.

699454,5,6303579345,"Soundless 8mm films of his vanished childhood draw failed comedian Oliver Platt back to Blackpool, Britain's home of sea, sand, oddball entertainment and -- for Platt -- vanished perfection. The first thing he asks the lawyer retained to help him find material to buy is, ""Did the sun always shine back then? Were WE funnier back then?""The lawyer, with a tentative glance at this intense new client, agrees: ""Yes. Yes, I think so.""

Platt, as the failed son of a megastar comedian, Jerry Lewis, has known pain. But his return to childhood's paradise will bring more. He learns that his father stole the act that made him famous, and left behind an unacknowledged love child, Lee Evans, with the peerless Leslie Caron. The boy's path has not been smooth, but his pain has transmuted his talent for comedy into something rare and original.

The secondary plots and characters are too numerous to try to enumerate here, but here are some lines I scribbled down: ""I never saw anything funny that wasn't terrible -- that didn't cause pain."" ""Why do all the best things in life belong to the past?"" Perhaps. But Platt' s character will learn that everything in the past was in the present once, and that perhaps the present is only raw material for the past.

Jerry Lewis gives a rare performance as a pure straight man, and knocks it out of the park, He tells his son, ""There are two kinds of funny people; those with funny bones, and those who tell funny stories. And son -- you're not funny."" He then confesses he left his own ""funny bones"" behind when he became a ""joke man,"" and you see a new dramatic range in Lewis's genuine conflict and desperate fatherly love.

Platt takes the blow and hooks up with his half-brother, who has a very funny act indeed. I won't describe the climax, but the gooey-ized word redemption is, for once, not off the mark. A movie you will watch twice -- it makes demands on you -- and revisit often thereafter. It is the soap bubble we both want and fear to catch.",1411689600,4,1993,4.57422969187675

First, you either love or hate this film; there's no middle ground. That's clear just from the dozens of posted reviews on its&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/main-DVD-page/dp/B00008L3TQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">main DVD page</a>. Here's what I take from ""Funny Bones"" beyond the basic plot.

We the audience are given a chance to visit for two hours with entertainers of all variety. We're all special in our own way, have our talents, and the folks in this movie are no different, for they are blessed with a unique ability to take the stage and hold our attention. And I don't just mean George Fawkes, the Parker brothers or Katy Parker, but also that crowd of oddball performers we see during the auditions, and a staccato jazz guitarist at a British cafe talent show. These people have the same gift as George Fawkes or Jack Parker, but perhaps in different measure.

Tommy Fawkes has that inherited drive of his father too, but he's unable to combine it with talent. After bombing terribly in a Las Vegas stand-up debut, off to Blackpool Tommy goes to discover his roots and try to learn the secret of being funny.

But the universe doesn't revolve around any single person. As Tommy is lost, so is Jack Parker, who killed his stepfather in front of an audience! Jack's Uncle Thomas was so traumatized by this horrific event, he stopped talking altogether and for twelve years. Thomas's brother Bruno, obviously the anchor of this family, steadfastly endures a wife who was unfaithful, the stigma of a murderous son who isn't even his, a friend who betrayed and abandoned him (George Fawkes) and the loss of that which he loves most dearly: entertaining, yet somehow Bruno perseveres in his own eccentric way.

Just a mention here of the 'fountain of youth powder' subplot which seems an excuse to shoehorn Oliver Reed and some colorful Frenchmen into the story. Nuff said.

So, Tommy discovers the amazingly talented young man (Jack) is his half brother and that his father ran to America when he impregnated Bruno Parker's wife (note that the story's main character, Tommy Fawkes is CLEARLY named for the elder Parker). When he left Blackpool, George stole the Parkers' act and used it as a steppingstone to American superstardom and enormous wealth.

Meanwhile, the Parker family is in shambles with young Jack a public pariah and Uncle Thomas withdrawn and silent. Bruno and Katie got divorced and she married another entertainer, a shiny-pated tyrant who abused teenaged Jack so much, the boy bashed his head in on-stage.

Years after the tragic event, Tommy Fawkes stumbles into this dysfunctional situation, despondent himself and ready to commit suicide but still willing to look for answers. He bonds with his half brother, confronts his father over George's wrongdoing, and together the Fawkes (father and son) help put the broken Parkers back together. The brothers (fueled by youth powder) have a triumphant return to the stage, as does Katie who is brilliant as ""Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile."" Then, Jack appears from nowhere and proves as Bruno admiringly tells George, that ""he is funnier than all of us.""

Even Tommy ""takes it to the edge"" and finds a way to get an audience to like him. It's a superb, exhilarating ending to a great story.

If you've read this far, I thank you.

French singer Charles Trenet's beautiful and emotional ""La Mer"" and its vandalized English version ""Beyond the Sea"" carry the movie to another level. The cast is phenomenal, and I think the movie should at least be seen for their performances alone. Jerry Lewis shows another, truer, darker side of him; the only real glimpse of him I saw after Scorsese's King of Comedy. Lee Evans is both sad, funny and on occasion scary, which would be mainly Peter Chelsom's credit. And it's refreshing to see Oliver Platt in a role in which he can fulfill his true potential, for a change. This is one of those rare movies where everything clicks together perfectly to make you realize, after seeing it, that cinema can be an art form, after all...",1303689600,2,1253,4.943127962085308
699645,5,6303579345,"I enjoy repeat views of this movie, as I know that I will find unexpected humor that I missed. TIPS:  1) If you purchase this video and not have seen it before, then you should skip the great review entitled ""for those who don't ""get"" Funnybones - instead, you should experience it first on your own.  2) ALSO, SKIP MY LAST SENTENCES. Read them AFTER you view the film; for starters, allow yourself to be baffled or surprised in some spots, and I envy your first experience.  3) BUT DO THIS: put your TV on closed captions at the ultimate and final circus scene at the sway pole, as you might not otherwise understand the thick British accent for the movie's final lines -an important conclusion.

NOW FOR THE DESCRIPTION: This movie was clearly a labor of love: a rich, sensitive exploration of many forms of humor and the people who do it. With every repeat view, you will see something new in the style of humor: in the set-up, often in the visuals, and in some one-liners - many of which are not central to the plot - just funny!  I think of it NOT as a ""comedy"", but as a drama ""about comedy"".  I did NOT laugh in the first viewing, but was, instead, was engaged, surprised and touched.  In later viewings, I found myself more relaxed and laughing in many unexpected scenes (the few seconds of the Jerry Lewis-Leslie Caron b/w scenes were the first to get me, as it was humor from childhood).  To the critics: Repeat criticisms have been made of the underdeveloped Oliver Reed / Magic Egg plot, but to its defense, it gives energy to the boffo performances by the Parker Brothers towards the end of the film.  Also, why not give the music a good listen, particularly at the rolling of the credits?  Can music be funny? Sure! Mere evidence of more good, loving choice by the movie makers.

SPOILER ALERT; newbies do not read this: There are clever lines that are often quoted from this movie, but an unquoted one that really caught me off-guard was the incongruity in ""Tommy! Oh, Tommy! Your father is worried to death!  He's in the pool.""  The wolf howl at the mortuary was another that got me chuckling, and a tip-off of the humor to follow.",1264982400,2,2147,4.460358056265985

699647,5,6303579345,"That involuntary shudder one experiences when ""Jerry Lewis"" is mentioned in the Gallic pantheon of cinematic greatness? We've all experienced it.
However, in the most unexpected of surprises, the director Peter Chelsom has set the stage in his home town of Blackpool, England for what must be considered one of the funniest movies ever made.

Making an extraordinary comedy required the direction of extraordinary comedic talent. In ""Funny Bones,"" three of the world's funniest older men (George Carl, Freddie Davies, Jerry Lewis) are woven into the backstory of someone even funnier than themselves (Lee Evans), via the pretext that Oliver Platt (Lewis' son and comedic flop) flees to Blackpool. The set-up takes patient attention, but it's well worth it.

699648,5,6303579345,"There is nothing I don't like about this movie, where buffoonery, pain, laughter, hard work and life itself come together and make magic.
In search for ""true funny"", main character - a tired-of-it-all comedic flop from Las Vegas - revisits his childhood home, Blackpool. He finds the true funny, and along with it, some truth about his father, some tragic secrets of the funny trade, with a dollop of reality.
To me, it's the ultimate truth about art as way of life - being good at what you do requires sacrifice and real life experience, no matter how weird. Even the wildest whimsical acts can't match the reality sometimes, and in some cases, the weirdest and darkest comedy seems like the only normal way of self-expression when compared with real life.
I highly recommend this movie also because it features phenomenal music, and when combined with the visuals it is absolutely out of this world.

This is NOT a comedy - it's a very serious film about funny people. It's wonderful and well-worth watching, but if you expect it to be 'funny' you'll probably be disappointed.

This is not to say that there aren't many brilliant comedic routines in the film (Lee Evans is fabulous--), but the storyline itself is serious.

This film starts well (with a kind of ""Local Hero"" vibe to it) and has a fantastic cast, but the various subplots become awkward and don't mesh well.

699653,5,6303579345,"I went to see Funny Bones when it first came out at the art theatre in Austin TX.  I thought there were several good comedic bits but was underwhelmed by the film as a whole.  Yet embedded in this movie are strange bits that linger in the fringes of the mind - not quite brilliant, but very intriguing.  Among these (and occurring within the first 20 minutes of the movie) are the drive through the Blackpool ""characters"", the fun house ride where patrons scream loudest at the living mannequins, the comedic horror of the opening smuggling boat scene, and the edginess surrounding Oliver Platt in his dressing room before his Las Vegas show.  These scenes stick with you after the movie ends, continuing to haunt you until you see the movie a second time and begin to make some sense of the convoluted plot.

And this movie is definitely worth a second viewing - for nothing else if not the comedic genius of Lee Evans, who is so adept at physical comedy throughout.  The plot of this movie explores the twinned natures of tragedy and comedy through half brothers (Evans and Platt) who are both pursuing ""funny bones"".  The plot has multiple lines, involving drug smuggling, redemption, finding one's place, and uncovering the nature of what is funny, that come together in the grand finale under the big top with the sway pole, Evans and Platt.

So give this one a second viewing - just see this movie as a combination of David Lynch and the Marx Brothers - to absorb the cosummate intricacy of FUNNY BONES.",1186704000,3,1509,4.6254681647940075

699736,4,6303579345,"Here is one more somewhat-unknown film I wish got more notice, although I'm not sure how many would like it because it's so different. It's a bizarre combination of humor and tragedy, of supernatural and straight drama. It's just an odd combination, but I find it very, very interesting and I've seen it three times, equally fascinated each time.

The movie goes back and forth between drama and comedy which makes unsettling for some viewers, but not me. It kept me on my toes, so to speak, even with those multiple viewings. Also in here is another example of how good comedians can be in dramatic roles, in this case, veteran comic Jerry Lewis. Oliver Platt plays his son, and does an outstanding job as the main figure in this film. The comedy is really provided by others, most notably the most tragic figure in the film: ""Jack Parker,"" effectively played by Lee Evans.

There is really is no way to adequately explain this strange film in a few paragraphs. I would just say if you are looking for something different, give this a try. And stay with it, even if the first half hour is not to your liking. You will be rewarded.",1145232000,4,1131,4.53921568627451
699737,5,6303579345,"Funny Bones is a hilarious black comedy that got overlooked because it is too smart and multi-faceted for easy categorization. Admittedly the film has flaws.  The Vegas-Blackpool connection is something of a kluge, and the Parker Brothers vaudeville act is a far cry from the Tommy Fawkes - two dogs walk into a bar - style of comedy that begins the movie. The sub-plot of stolen life-preserving powder, corrupt policemen, and French-Egyptians is a distraction at best, although the severed feet do provide a splendid ""running"" gag. But these criticisms are trivial when compared to what the movie gets right.

First, it totally understands the relationship between humor and pain, and gives an honest and sympathetic view of this bond, a bond that is closer than liver and onions, corned beef and cabbage, wang and chung.  Next it features some true comedy genius, primarily thanks to Lee Evans as a semi-autistic virtual mime who is as funny in his interactions with a police psychologist as he is on stage in his one-man radio-riffing manic extravaganza. Those few minutes alone are worth the price of the movie, as is the scene where he and Platt sneak into the mortuary to retrieve the severed feet.  Evans, Jack, has cleverly decided to stash the feet in a ski-boot case, and, to complete his disguise, carries a pair of skis with him. Priceless.

Equally inspired are the scenes where assorted Blackpool entertainers audition, (you'll replay this many times), and when we finally get to see the Parker Brothers do their famous act - vaudeville at its very best. That the Parker Brothers live inside a roller coaster and earn their living as human mannequins in a chamber of horrors train-ride is simply par for the course in Funny Bones.

Oliver Platt is very good as a man trying to survive a narcissistic and insufferable father. Leslie Caron still looks good although her contribution is minor, and Oliver Reed makes the most of a small part. The surprise is Jerry Lewis. This is not the obnoxious, pseudo-retarded Jerry Lewis you've come to know and hate through decades of despicable films. This is the Jerry Lewis you saw in King Of Comedy, another movie that looked unflinchingly at the relationship between comedy and pain. He's not on camera much, but every moment he is rings true and affirms the movie's authenticity.

Wonderfully cracked, characters you have to love, extremely funny, well made. Don't miss this one.  And the first dog says....",1140912000,14,2463,4.918072289156626

699739,5,6303579345,"Whether you label this film as a black comedy or as a dark familial drama with bits of comedy thrown in, FUNNY BONES is a brilliantly dark masterpiece containing first rate acting performances by all of the principals, and especially Lee Evans (There's Something About Mary, Mousehunt). In fact, it is Lee Evans who super-charges this movie with his complex and outrageously funny portrayal of the disturbed comic genius Jack Parker.

The supporting cast, including the brilliant Jerry Lewis, Leslie Caron, George Carl, and Oliver Reed, all offer strong performances as does Oliver Platt, playing the failed comic Tommy Fawkes, who goes back to the Blackpool, England of his early youth in search of the secrets of comedy. He will eventually uncover many of these secrets, as well as some dark family secrets he didn't anticipate finding. Lewis plays a supporting role as Tommy's father, a superstar comic who rules the Las Vegas strip and overshadows his son.

The quirky citizens of Blackpool, including the aforementioned Jack Parker, add charm, comedy, and warmth to this film. At times disturbing, heartbreaking, suspenseful, and hysterical, FUNNY BONES is an odd little film, but one that lends itself to many viewings.

I review very few films, but feel compelled to recommend FUNNY BONES since few people seem to have seen it and because it is one of my favorite films of all time.

699740,5,6303579345,"I have grown to love this movie.  The first time I saw it I was put off and disturbed.  Yet, it stayed with me.  I wanted to and did see it many more times.  The tension between Oliver Platt, as the failed son of superstar Jerry Lewis, is palpable.  The shock Platt's character suffers when learning his father stole his material from Blackpool vaudevillians seems to redeem and reinspire Platt.  The many Blackpool comics who you see add splashes of color and old-fashioned slapstick talent to this drama.  The ""Parker Brothers"" from whom Lewis stole his material are completely bizarre yet utterly charming.  Platt's newly discovered half-brother (Lee Evans) is the unheralded star of the show, playing a disturbed yet highly talented physical comic.  Some of the best scenes involve Platt and Evans' new routine and a visit to a morgue.  Jerry Lewis is wonderful in a backing role, a Las Vegas superstar whose dark secrets are revealed, becoming more human and less of an obstacle for his troubled sons.  The more I see this film the more I spot the details and many layers to the story.  What makes this movie special are the tensions between the characters and the challenges each overcomes when Platt's travels unveil the past and reinvigorate a seemingly more innocent and forgotten community of performers.  Poignant comic moments abound but, again, this is a drama.  Because this is such a unique film, I think it must have been a nightmare to market.  You can't accurately describe it in 10 words or less.  ""Troubling and inspiring"" occurs to me, but that won't sell tickets.  Fortunately for you, it's inexpensive and regularly appearing on cable tv if you want a trial run.  A worthwhile addition to my DVD library.",1108944000,17,1727,4.836177474402731

If you saw Mouse Hunt with Nathan Lane you might remember the brother. That was Lee Evans. He does a very unusual, very funny bit, in this movie. Worth the price of the film.
Oliver Platt is the son of a famous comedian, played by Jerry Lewis, who fails as he tries to follow in his father's footsteps. To get inspiration he returns to the town his family had left when he was almost too young to remember. Revelations abound. If you approach this movie as a father - son relationship film and not as a comedy you should enjoy it. If you do not enjoy the Lee Evan's bit then you do not have a sense of humor and you should get yourself one.",1083024000,10,803,4.187096774193549

The main bit about the father and the son, and the secrets and desires around them, is all worth watching. But we get hit by these little loose strands about a mob boss and a stolen wax egg that never seem to fit in with the rest of the theme and are hence left to fizzle off half-baked.
Acting etc is all fine, but the script is doozy and the screenplay patchy, which may work for some (who like ""different cinema"") but it is not youe average comedy yarn. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.",1082419200,7,710,4.007042253521127

Having seen ""king of comedy"" recently, and some old jerry classics from the 60's. i was expecting and looking forward to alote of fun here! according to the cover, you're suposed to believe that jerry has one of the leading roles.. yeah right, more like a cameo. ok?
jerry has a short scene at the begining of the movie, then he doesnt show up untill near the end. (how 'bout that?) where he does a couple of quick shots. the movie's main stars are oliver platt and his psycho half brother, who beats a clown to death. very cruel and disturbing, yes. comedy? this isn't a comedy folks, its a drama with alote of cruel violence.
the movie starts off with a kid being slaughterd under a boat at sea. then you see oliver platt performing before an audience, being humiliated before a crowd sence they doesnt laugh at his jokes. jerry lewis is magnificent as his suporting father.
oliver platt though, the star of the movie, plays an ego who only cares about himself and acts like a.. well you know. and thats the guy who you gotta follow through the whole movie!
jerry lewis actally has only about 3 or 4 ""real"" scenes, the rest is just short cuts at him. sitting in an audience or something. so all in all, quite an annoying film with alote of disturbing scenes. love jerry though, catch him in some of his old classics, or ""king of comedy"" where he stars along with robert de niro, now thats an old masterpiece! one of my favorite movies. there are so many great movies in this amazon jungle, so take my advice and spend your money on something else.
the cover on this film is misleading, and when the cover is misleading.. well.. you know what that means.

blues legend john lee hooker boogies away on his hit ""boogie chillen"". so i suggest you buy the soundtrack and skip the movie.

For example:  in the very first scene a man is pushed overboard into the ocean and his feet are chopped off by the boat's propeller.  In the next scene, the feet wash up on shore (separately).  Perhaps this was supposed to be funny, but it made me gag (just like most of the people who were on the beach at the time).  Most of the English characters are troubled in some way - some are deeply psychologically scarred.  The main character as played by Oliver Platt is full of enthusiasm for his ""mission"" but certainly never funny.
In fact, the only part that made me laugh was after the feet had been stolen from the morgue and Platt's character holds up a newspaper with the headline ""Feet Walk from Mortuary.""
The climax of this movie was tense and I almost turned the DVD off without finishing the movie, but it redeemed itself in the last 2 minutes, so I'm glad I at least finished it.  It did bother me for a few days though.

First, you either love or hate this film; there's no middle ground. That's clear just from the dozens of posted reviews on it. Here's what I take from this picture beyond the basic plot.

We the audience are given a chance to visit for two hours with entertainers of all variety. We're all special in our own way, have our talents, and the folks in this movie are no different, for they are blessed with a unique ability to take the stage and hold our attention. And I don't just mean George Fawkes, the Parker brothers or Katy Parker, but also that crowd of oddball performers we see during the auditions, and a staccato jazz guitarist at a British cafe talent show. These people have the same gift as George Fawkes or Jack Parker, but perhaps in different measure.

Tommy Fawkes has that inherited drive of his father too, but he's unable to combine it with talent. After bombing terribly in a Las Vegas stand-up debut, off to Blackpool Tommy goes to discover his roots and try to learn the secret of being funny.

But the universe doesn't revolve around any single person. As Tommy is lost, so is Jack Parker, who killed his stepfather in front of an audience! Jack's Uncle Thomas was so traumatized by this horrific event that he stopped talking altogether and for twelve years. Thomas's brother Bruno, obviously the anchor of this family, steadfastly endures a wife who was unfaithful, the stigma of a murderous son who isn't even his, a friend who betrayed and abandoned him (George Fawkes) and the loss of that which he loves most dearly: entertaining, yet somehow Bruno perseveres in his own eccentric way.

Just a mention here of the 'fountain of youth powder' subplot which seems an excuse to shoehorn Oliver Reed and some colorful Frenchmen into the story. Nuff said.

So, Tommy discovers the amazingly talented young man (Jack) is his half brother and that his father ran to America when he impregnated Bruno Parker's wife (note that the story's main character Tommy Fawkes is CLEARLY named for the elder Parker. When he left Blackpool, George stole the Parkers' act and used it as a steppingstone to American superstardom and enormous wealth.

Meanwhile, the Parker family is in shambles wth young Jack a public pariah and Uncle Thomas withdrawn and silent. Bruno and Katie got divorced and she married another entertainer, a bald-headed tyrant who abused teenaged Jack so much that the boy bashed his head in on-stage.

Years after the tragic event, Tommy Fawkes stumbles into this dysfunctional situation, despondent himself and ready to commit suicide but still willing to look for answers. He bonds with his half brother, confronts his father over George's wrongdoing, and together the Fawkes (father and son) help put the broken Parkers back together. The brothers (fueled by youth powder) have a triumphant return to the stage, as does Katie who is brilliant as ""Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile."" Then, Jack appears from nowhere and proves as Bruno admiringly tells George, that ""he is funnier than all of us.""

Even Tommy ""takes it to the edge"" and finds a way to get an audience to like him. It's a superb, exhilarating ending to a great story.

If you've read this far, I thank you.
I'll leave with one final point: FUNNY BONES is NOT a comedy. There are elements of comedy in it but in large part this is both a psychological study of dysfunctional families and a look into the souls of that special breed of people: entertainers.",1435276800,3,3614,4.758785942492013
