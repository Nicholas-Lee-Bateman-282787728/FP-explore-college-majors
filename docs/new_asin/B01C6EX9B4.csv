I find her instructions easy to follow with a range of modifications so as I improve I can continue to challenge myself. What I most appreciate is that this is a real workout that is actually achievable by someone who is more of an '''average person' when it comes to fitness level, and does not make you feel like a loser because you can't keep up from start to finish with moves that only your top fitness level people can achieve(I find such videos very discouraging). As someone who can not spend her life in the gym, this video has helped me build core strength AND  work up a sweat with a  good balance of cardio and strength building. Plus, it  does not aggravate my knee injury from 'the good old days'. I would purchase this again and  hope she creates more videos.",1461974400,,883,4.327272727272727
