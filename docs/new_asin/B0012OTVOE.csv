8246970,2,B0012OTVOE,"This dvd was recommended by yoga instructor.  However, I find that the filming of the instruction was focused on instructor talking rather than actually showing the asanas.",1361577600,,172,5.37037037037037
8246971,5,B0012OTVOE,"Real Yoga for Real People can be done by anyone wishing to try it out for themselves.
Simple, easy, and utilizing the breath.  I liked that the focus was on the power of the breath.",1358899200,,181,4.171428571428572
8246972,2,B0012OTVOE,"Unfortunately, this video provides neither real yoga nor real people.
The practice of yoga is much more than the asanas.  Grated, Mark Whitewell acknowledges this fact in the introduction; however the camera zeros in on young women with ballet training and leaves those with bodies representing 99.9% of human beings in the background.  So, one again, the young and the beautiful are the stars and everyone else is just an extra in the movie of life.
The movements are repetitive and limited.  I was hoping for more of a variety of the thousands of asanas that are part of the physical aspect of yoga.  I am glad that Mark emphasized the importance of pranyama; however, a section on pranyama and perhaps a section on the 8 limbs of yoga would have rounded out the bare bones of the DVD.
To summarize: Both the models and the video need a bit more flesh on their bones.",1339286400,2,869,4.587096774193548
8246973,3,B0012OTVOE,"The filming of this DVD is terrible.  It bounces all around the room.  It also zooms in on particpant's bodies making it difficult to determine what the pose should be.  The DVD itself appears to be somewhat instructional but if you don't know what he is talking about, then you can't see a good example of what you should be doing.",1251849600,,332,4.409836065573771
8246974,5,B0012OTVOE,"I have been studying with Mark when he comes to Tucson and have been quite impressed with his presence and the authenticity of his practice. This DVD is a good representation of his teaching, and the documentary , with the interviews of his students , was fresh and honest. It presents his basic practice sequence with some great philosophical commentary. It would be a great introduction to his approach for someone not familiar with him. It's great so see a yoga DVD that is neither gymnastics or so watered down that it has nothing to do with yoga.",1211241600,,551,4.63265306122449
8246975,5,B0012OTVOE,This yoga video is fantastic simple and easy to follow. One of the best yoga dvd's available - very useful and real instruction for everyone.,1206662400,3,141,4.68
