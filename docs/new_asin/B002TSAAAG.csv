Contacted Amazon and tried to discover what was going on; after waiting on hold for some time they answered, but the phone clicked and they hung up. $9.99 for a single Marx Brothers movie? That's not a great deal. I could do better at the DVD bin at the car wash.",1287705600,5,409,4.394736842105263

3986061,4,B002TSAAAG,"""TCM Classic Films Collection: The Marx Brothers""  contains four feature films:  ""A Day at the Races,"" ""A Night in Casablanca,"" ""Room Service,"" and ""At the Circus.""

In ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), Groucho is Dr. Hackenbush, the epitome of quackery whose special patient is Mrs. Emily Upjohn (Margaret Dumont).  There was never a better comic foil than Ms. Dumont and she is in great form here, especially when she undergoes a medical examination that includes a shoeshine, manicure, and shave.  Groucho and Chico engage in a seven-minute routine in which Chico, hawking ""tutsi-fruitsi ice cream,"" sells Groucho a racing tip which requires a succession of books to decode.

""At the Circus"" (1939) is memorable mostly for Groucho's rendition of ""Lydia, the Tattooed Lady,"" which became one of his signature songs.  Margaret Dumont is on hand again, this time as Mrs. Dukesbury to Groucho's J. Cheever Loophole, and Eve Arden contributes her comic talents as Peerless Pauline, a shady acrobat.",1271894400,4,991,5.15625
3986062,2,B002TSAAAG,"Why indeed would they omit 'Night at the Opera' ? To include 'Night in Casablanca' instead seems disingenuous at best, sneaky at worse.

3986063,4,B002TSAAAG,"The two really great films that the Marx Brothers did after they left Paramount were ""A Night at the Opera"" (the best IMHO) and ""A Day at the Races"". These two have Margaret Dumont sparring with Groucho as usual.  ""Races"" and ""Opera"" were the two films that boy genius Irving Thalberg supervised after personally wooing the Marx's to come to MGM in the first place. Louis B. Mayer really had no use for the brothers, and it shows in the kinds of films they were given after Thalberg died in 1936. The best of the Marx Brothers are what they did at Paramount, still with us in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Marx-Brothers-Silver-Screen-Collection-The-Cocoanuts-Animal-Crackers-Monkey-Business-Horse-Feathers-Duck-Soup/dp/B0002MHDYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection (The Cocoanuts / Animal Crackers / Monkey Business / Horse Feathers / Duck Soup)</a>. The Marx Brothers were iconoclasts at heart, and after the production code began to be enforced they really had no home in motion pictures. I think Irving Thalberg was wrong to think that the problem was that the brothers never helped anyone in their movies, but the formula he came up with in ""Opera"" and ""Races"" did make their comedy work in the age of the code.

""At the Circus"" and ""A Night in Casablanca"" are OK. On the bright side ""At the Circus"" has Margaret Dumont. On the not so bright side it is infected with musical numbers that are, quite frankly, boring. ""A Night in Casablanca"" almost gets the boys back to the quality they had in the mid 30's under Thalberg, so it is worthwhile viewing, although it does lend a generosity to the boys that simply does not fit their brand of humor.

""Room Service"" (1938) is actually an RKO film, so for once no musical numbers. This script was not written especially for the brothers, it was one of the few films they did with adapted material. The humor is OK, but it just doesn't seem like a Marx Brothers film.

In my opinion&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Marx-Brothers-Collection-A-Night-at-The-Opera-A-Day-at-The-Races-A-Night-in-Casablanca-Room-Service-At-the-Circus-Go-West-The-Big-Store/dp/B0001HAIP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Marx Brothers Collection (A Night at The Opera/A Day at The Races/A Night in Casablanca/Room Service/At the Circus/Go West/The Big Store)</a>&nbsp;is a more complete picture of the film career of the Marx Brothers after the code.

In the first film, the laughs do not stop when these guys skewer the medical profession and bring home a horse track winner. Wacky fun! In the second film, it is Nazis against nutsos when the Brothers foil Nazi activity at a hotel with total nonsense. Hilarious! In the third movie, Lucille Ball(I Love Lucy) and Ann Miller guest star in a laugh riot about a poor broadway act tryin to ""get a gig"". Classic comedy all-star cast! In the last film, comedy at the circus galore! Lydia the Tattooed Lady and Eve Arden co-star. Very funny! Just like The Three Stooges, Our Gang, The Little Rascals, and Laurel & Hardy,  this comedy is still talked about and viewed after over 70 years! This is the hilarious, clean comedy that your grandma and grandpa watched when they were young! Why do people still watch it to this day? One reason: IT IS HILARIOUS. This is like classic rock.

3986117,5,B002TSAAAG,"If you're a Marx Brothers fan, or curious about them, and you can get this set for under $20, then I recommend it highly.  Of the four films included, one is among their very best (""A Day at the Races""), one is quite good (""A Night in Casablanca""), and two are okay, but still very watchable (""Room Service"" and ""At the Circus"").  The latter two are a bit slower and more ""stagey"" than the others, but still offer their rewards.

If you're not familiar with the Marx Brothers, this is a good introduction to their peculiar zaniness: puns, wacky practical jokes, physical comedy, sexual innuendo, and musicianship (Chico on piano, Harpo on, well, on the harp!) -- all in the service of a pair of lovers who are being targeted by villains bent on framing or robbing them.  If you're the sort of person who can't enjoy the Marx Brothers, then you have my sincere sympathy.

3986122,5,B002TSAAAG,"They weren't the first, but they were the most remembered. Today their comedy stands the test of time with their flippant mannerism that were certain to disrupt any serious concern in the scene by scene silliness. In truth it has been this method of conflict that washed into out street antics of the 60s and scared the shorts off of our political agenda. As the Marx Brothers depict so splendidly; ""If we don't respect it, then it's not there!""

An excellent bargain for the price. The reason A Night At The Opera is not included was probably because it is a major movie and that one in itself is full of various extra features as well.

The laptop is Amazon's top seller ASUS, but from 2015.  It's unfortunate because both products are awesome, just not compatible for some reason.  Maybe they are compatible for you?  I hope so.  I wish you much luck in your experience.  There are two films on this collection that are generally regarded as among the best the Brothers had ever performed.  Pretty exciting stuff and for me, it's true, but I did downgrade due to the inconsistency of the Amazon production.
