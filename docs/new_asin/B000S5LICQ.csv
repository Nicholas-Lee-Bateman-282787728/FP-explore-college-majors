8204282,5,B000S5LICQ,Vital Remains now this DVD live is some awesome stuff to get into. Metalheads get this item it is worth it. Hammer down the Nails is an awesome track from this DVD and has extras stuff that is interesting also.,1400630400,,210,4.275
8204283,5,B000S5LICQ,"this does not have glen benton of deicide on vocals but has a guy named damian (don't know his last name)
instead. this concert is the the best songs from both dechristianize and icons of evil. the music is fantastic, damians vocals are a bit strained, but still audible. my favorite element of his performance is his stage presence
being that of a wrathful devil pissed-off-at-the-world, giving ""what-for"" to the audiance probably for GP logic.

i happened to get into this band just because glen benton of deicide had joined(at the time, to the shock and disgust of his ex ding dong guitarists the hoffmanns whom some have called muscle-head and laughing-boy) somewhere online glen has professed a revelation that eric has a/o had a steriod problem(i had always wondered why his arms looked puffed-up muscular, rather than veiny iron sculpted natural looking in the 1990's) and apparently bi-polar and brian being wed to a woman half his age whom apparently runs his life for him(not very responsible nor true individualism).

when i listen to this style of black metal music the occultism must be the real thing and not the book of revelations juvinile/judeo-christian faced variety from the 1980's.

unfortunately i cannot give a track listing, because my cd copy is put away for a short time, sorry!

those whom know how this kind of music is supposed to be made and take their black metal with a rightous degree of seriousness and legitimacy will buy this.

thank you>!",1327968000,2,1475,4.884
8204284,4,B000S5LICQ,"Vital Remains blast out brutal death metal songs that are as epic as can be. With seven songs (plus two intros) in one hour's time, they perform about four full songs in the time it takes Slayer to do a complete concert. Sound and video are absolutely on top, the surround effect encompasses you and the bass doesn't let down. Play it wickedly loud next time the Jehova's witnesses are around! Damien Boynton (the live singer for this occasion) does some of the funniest ""wicked"" looks you'll ever see, but he's a pretty solid vocalist (not a new Glen Benton though). The band must be praised for the pure stamina of seven to ten-minute epics with non-stop frantic blast beats, deep guttural growling, and relentless guitar and bass shredding.

On the other hand, the only extra included is an interview with Suzuki and Lazaro, and even though it does cover their full history, it gets to be a bit bland with such a boring interviewer and one too many beers. Who wouldn't rather have liked to see Damien explain those wicked looks he gives on stage? They're priceless!

If you're into Vital Remains, get this for the show - it'll rip you to shreds. But don't expect any special extras (the nifty slide-out packaging doesn't count).",1250208000,2,1231,4.694444444444445
8204285,5,B000S5LICQ,"great dvd. video and sound quality are amazing. i only wish they'd done some filming when they toured with glen benton and tim yeung. damien boyton is good, but he ain't glen...

BUT DAMIEN BOYTON IS OK BUT NOT AS GOOD AS GLEN.
DVD HAS A COOL INTERVIEW WITH TONY LAZARO AND DAVE SUZUKI
VERY GOOD SOUND AND VIDEO QUALITY
ALL AND ALL A KILLER DVD",1196467200,,230,3.9148936170212765
