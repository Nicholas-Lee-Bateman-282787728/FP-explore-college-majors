8323982,5,B00000ICVO,"This video charges me up for the slopes every season.

Not only because of the video footage (which is flat-out

amazing), but because of the soundtrack. By FAR the

best soundtrack EVER. It's hard to beat a soundtrack

that features Misfits, Possum Dixon, Primus, Treepeople,

Black Eyed Peas, etc.

Back to the video part....lust worthy riding in all

kinds of situations...featuring legendary riders that

include Tex Davenport and Victoria Jeaulouse....this video

is lust-worthy.",1172448000,,484,5.52054794520548
8323983,4,B00000ICVO,"Lust for Life is an extremely well performed video.  leaving the viewers actually want to hit the mountain and pull some ...360's or bak flips.  with great musik and sum of the greatest riders to ever hit the slopes, L.F.L. is perfect.  i didn't like though the lack of shos for the boarders.  if ur gonna show like B.J. Leines give him summore clip-time.  other than the shortness L.F.L. was by far one of the greatest film of the 90's",1046390400,,436,4.4
8323984,4,B00000ICVO,good all around video..never gets uninteresting.... my question is when is anybody gonna come out with a video longer then 40 min??,1038441600,,131,5.0
8323985,4,B00000ICVO,"Its pretty good, features nothing but boarders doing what they do best, big air, crazy stunts, and some awesome downhill boarding.",961113600,7,130,5.238095238095238
