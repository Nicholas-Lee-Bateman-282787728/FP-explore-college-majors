8193762,5,B000PY3XJG,This box set is a very good selection among all the films performed by this famous and serious actor. I recommend it for Bela Lugosi`s fans or for someone who wants to watch the early terror films of the 30s and 40s.,1220745600,,216,4.166666666666667
8193763,3,B000PY3XJG,"A half-century after his death, Bela Lugosi's popularity continues unabated. It would undoubtedly please the man to know that he has outdistanced his hated rival, Boris Karloff with fans of vintage fright films.

After the worldwide success Bela enjoyed with Dracula (1931), he was soon relegated to UNIVERSAL's 'B' movie unit, turning out low-budget but still decent films every six months or so. For much of his career, Lugosi labored against typecasting (usually a mad scientist or other demented character), his lack of command of English and an addiction to morphine. By the early 1950s, Bela was all but forgotten, until he met up with Ed Wood, who starred Lugosi in three of his strange little films.

Following the success of FRANKENSTEIN, UNIVERSAL paired up Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-BELA-LUGOSI-COLLECTION/dp/B0009X770E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION</a>, from UNIVERSAL/MCA, features three of these teamed films, plus two solo Lugosi efforts.

ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, liner notes appear on box's back cover.

8193764,3,B000PY3XJG,"Considering the low price and number of films included on the discs, my expectations on DVD quality were modest. But I was surprised and disappointed that ""Scared to Death"" (Lugosi's only color film) was presented in black and white. I was not surprised that the brief color sequence in ""The Death Kiss"" was missing since the sequence has usually been cut in past videos (the color has been restored in the Roan version). However, ""Scared to Death"" has been readily available in color for many years on both video tape and DVD. Otherwise the films in this set are watchable although I'm doubtful about the company's claims of digital remastering. My own favorites are ""White Zombie"", ""The Human Monster"", and ""The Corpse Vanishes."" Lugosi has a field day in those three films as throughly evil characters without any redeeming qualities.",1191801600,11,837,4.985714285714286
8193765,5,B000PY3XJG,"I haven't purchased this ""Bela Lugosi Collection"" 3-Disc DVD set, but I wanted to write this ""FYI"" review to talk about the specific movies that are included in this release from St. Clair Vision.

There are 9 Lugosi films in this set. Here's a list:

1.) ""White Zombie"" (1932)
2.) ""The Human Monster"" (AKA: ""The Dark Eyes Of London"")(1940)
3.) ""One Body Too Many"" (1944)
4.) ""Invisible Ghost"" (1941)
5.) ""The Phantom Creeps"" (1939)
6.) ""The Death Kiss"" (1932)
7.) ""Scared To Death"" (1947)
8.) ""Black Dragons"" (1942)
9.) ""The Corpse Vanishes"" (1942)

Some bonus features are apparently also included in this set too (poster gallery, radio material, and some trailers). Doesn't sound too bad for this budget price.

St. Clair Vision has also put together other ""horror""-themed DVD packages (at similarly-low price points) -- such as multi-movie collections featuring&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boris-Karloff/dp/B000PY50ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boris Karloff</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lon-Chaney-Jr/dp/B000PY3XJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lon Chaney Jr.</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vincent-Price/dp/B000PY3XIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vincent Price</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Lee/dp/B000R3PDFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Lee</a>.
