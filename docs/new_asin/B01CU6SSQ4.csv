7689881,4,B01CU6SSQ4,So far so good. Was questionable even though it was a prime product but was going to take an extra couple days. I believe I ordered this on Thursday and was said to be here the following Monday. Luckily it was here that Sunday I bet the mail lady loved that lol. Packaging was in good condition. Plastic had one tiny hole in I but I think that was there from me opening the envelope. Discs are in a cardboard type sleeve similar to what video games with multiple discs used to come in. Not what I would say is the best I will probably invest in some Blu Ray cases but it does the job none the less.,1499904000,,598,4.033613445378151

7689884,3,B01CU6SSQ4,"This product is actually the European version of Game of Thrones Season 1-5, not the American version.

I noticed the introduction slides were a bit different, but I could not put my finger on it. There was no FBI warning as is typically the case prior to American productions. I wanted to see if the product was going to be a problem in my Blu-Ray DVD player.

Initially, the DVDs played fine. They loaded slower than most Blu-Ray DVDs, but I attributed that to the quantity of information than the disks. However, I have had several disks be inserted only for the Blu-Ray player to display ""copyright violation"" on my TV screen. Obviously, there is no copyright violation as I purchased the product here, but the Blu-Ray players cannot tell the difference. I had to turn the Blu-Ray player off 5-10 times before the disk with problems would play properly.

This happened with one other disk. All of the other disks were slow to display, but otherwise played normally.

The price for this product is relatively  low for what you are getting, but I don't know if the headache is worth is discount.",1496793600,10,1097,4.66321243523316

7689898,4,B01CU6SSQ4,"This is a wonderful addition to the collection of any fan of the series. It includes wonderful pictures of different characters on the individual cases, and a quote from that particular season. If you haven't seen Game of Thrones in blueray yet, I highly recommend it. My biggest complaint, and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5, is how the disks are actually sitting in the case. Rather than snapping into place, as is the case with most movie and game cases, the simply sit inside of little slots that are just a bit too loose. Because of this, at least in disk falls out everytime that I've handled the cases. Not a major issue, but the choice in packaging is enough to bother me.

Overall, I an extremely satisfied with this purchase! More than worth the $$ if you're looking to collect the whole series. It's comparitvely about $35 a piece if you opt to buy each season individually, so this is a steal.",1489536000,4,911,4.4879518072289155

But the product itself has both pros and cons, some pros are that the first two seasons have episode guides that have a list of family trees and the different ""houses"" in the expansive world. While the 3rd through 5th seasons also have these episode guides they don't include these character trees, however all the seasons include lots of extra content along with the episodes.

7689945,2,B01CU6SSQ4,"I am a fan of medieval chivalry and stories, but this series is just grotesque. It is full of unnecessary bloody scenes combined with violence and sex. The script seems to be very stupid. And there is no ending. No actual plot. Everybody conspiring against everybody, and everybody kills everybody. What a pervert plan to have all the Strak family massacred in order to make the young girl, Ayra, a sadic avenger!  In terms of special effects and scenery, the series is very well done, but this is the case for almost every TV series or big screen films these days. Such a waste of time, money, and efforts that went into the production of this hideous series!",1484006400,,660,4.593220338983051

7690026,5,B01CU6SSQ4,"This just showed up and I have not previously seen the series, so I not be reviewing the quality of the show.

Just so everyone is clear, I ordered and am reviewing the package entitled ""Game of Thrones - Season 1-5 (Slimline Packaging) [Blu-ray] [Region Free]""

Here is what is included in this box set.
  - Seasons 1-5. Seasons 1-3 consist of 5 discs each. Seasons 4 and 5 consist of 4 discs each
  - A pamphlet/book insert for each season showing a variety of things. Such as, season 1 and 2s insert include an episode list, a list of bonus features, family tree for the major houses, a map of Westeros, and a map of that place to the East, I cant remember all the names of places as I have only read the first book and have not yet watched the show. See my attached pictures to see the maps.
  - Bonus features for each season include commentaries, extra scenes, some gag reels, and lots of others including bits like 'the making of' and 'character profiles.' I won't list all of the bonus features, because there are a lot of them.

I tested the first disc of each season to ensure this pack isn't region locked for me. I am in the USA, and all the discs I tested work on my PS4.

In the pictures I have included size comparisons to a regular blu ray case. I appreciate the Slimline packaging since it is very simple and fairly compact.",1472774400,217,1341,4.285714285714286

7690028,5,B01CU6SSQ4,"Blueray disks perfect, no issues using them. Haven't tested them all yet we only binge watched the first season so far. Came with a nice little booklet ""cheat sheet"" showing family tree and how all the characters relate to each other. (There's MANY people to keep track of.)

As to the series itself: Unlike many other books to TV renditions, I don't think any readers will be disappointed. Characters are spot on, settings,dress & special effects are amazing, and of course there's dragons. Nothing beats dragons!",1472515200,5,514,4.976744186046512
