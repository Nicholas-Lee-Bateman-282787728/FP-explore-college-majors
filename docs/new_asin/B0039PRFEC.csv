8392237,5,B0039PRFEC,"I was a Loyola student at the time of the 1963 Mississippi State game in East Lansing.  This documentary brought back a host of memories.  A powerful film, indeed!  Congratulations to the producer / director on a job well-done.

We in Chicago had heard vague rumors about what was going on back in Mississippi, but the courage shown by MSU's president, coach and players did not hit home until I viewed this film.  Times, they were a-changing!

P.S.  In a spirit of full disclosure, I should acknowledge that I knew everyone on Loyola's 1963 team including the producer / director's father  Jerry Harkness the team captain..  The late Vic Rouse was my fraternity brother.  While this means that the film hit me at more than one level, you did not have to ""be there"" to appreciate its message.",1518307200,,792,4.673913043478261
8392238,5,B0039PRFEC,"Game of Change is an inspirational and accurate tale of a time of change in Mississippi, sports, and the country as a whole. The bravery and character shown by the Mississippi State basketball team is a story every sports fan, Mississippian, and American should know. It is a story not told enough during a period where stories like these came to infrequently.",1457913600,,360,4.82258064516129
8392239,5,B0039PRFEC,I vaguely recall this game as a 12 year old growing in Mississippi. We didn't realize the significance back then. It is an account of some very young people and their coaches on both the Loyola and Mississippi State teams simply doing the right thing.,1396483200,,251,4.6
8392240,5,B0039PRFEC,Inspirational & accurate. Really shows the positive impact sports can have on society. Should be in every sports fan's dvd library,1387670400,,130,5.238095238095238

8392242,5,B0039PRFEC,"""Game of Change"" was a wonderfully told story which enlightened me about an era that I really hadn't grasped.  It brought to light the racism that existed back in the 60's and how it took just a few strong and brave individuals to take a stand for more to follow their lead.  We could all learn so much from all of these strong players, coaches, and leaders to continue to make this world a better place.  If you love basketball and history, this movie is one you shouldn't miss.",1360886400,,479,4.359550561797753
8392243,5,B0039PRFEC,"This was a fantastic documentary. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see how some young men stood their ground and found a way not just to play a game of basketball, but to take a stand against racism and discrimination.  This is a must see for everyone.",1328227200,2,271,4.313725490196078
