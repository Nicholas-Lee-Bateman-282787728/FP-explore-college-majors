8165367,4,B000HZELV2,"I purchased the product because I love history and this DVD on New York met all my expectations.  New York City has a magnificent history wrapped in the different races and ethnic groups who came here over one hundred years ago to make it a spectacular mosaic.  I was also pleased with the delivery by the company that sold me the DVD.  I would definitely buy from them again.
Thank you,
