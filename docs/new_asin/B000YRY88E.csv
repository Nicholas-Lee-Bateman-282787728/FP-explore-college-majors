8233977,5,B000YRY88E,"As you know, I was not impressed with the first volume of Operation Overdrive.  But I happened to buy this volume, and it was much better.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

624-625:  Thrax, the son of Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, unites all four Corona Aurora-seeking factions of villains into a new Evil Alliance.  When they manage to overwhelm the Overdrive Rangers, their connection to the Morphing Grid is severed, and their powers destroyed!  With the gems still needing protecting, Sentinel Knight assembles a team of replacement Rangers, made up of members of previous (or future) teams of Power Rangers.  Will they be enough to stop the Evil Alliance?  And will the former Overdrive Rangers be able to assist with just their genetically enhanced abilities?  My major incentive for giving Operation Overdrive another try, and it did not disappoint in the least.  Looks like Lightspeed Rescue is going to hold the record for worst team-up episode.  A+

626.  One Fine Day:  The Rangers get a day off, and plan a relaxing picnic in the forest. Unfortunately for Rose, Tyzonn is obsessed with getting to know her better, which goes from flattery to annoyance very quickly.  The Fearcats just happen to be in the same forest, and while searching for the powerful Centurion Torch to use in their latest Giant Robot, they put up a Lamporean force field.  Our heroes bump into it, and despite Tyzonn claiming that forming a human chain with his Mercurian powers will allow them passage, they end up separated... with Rose stuck inside the force field with Tyzonn!  A great episode with some very funny moments.  A

627-628.  Ronny On Empty:  Ronny is kidnapped by the Fearcats, while Will disobeys orders to go after her.  Meanwhile, a clue from the Centurion Torch leads the other Rangers to Egypt.  Why was Ronny's energy specifically needed to power a dinosaur mecha?  Still, if you can go with that (and we all know we've seen dumber things in the franchise) this is a great 2 part episode.  A

629.  Things Not Said:  The Rangers battle one of Kamdor's monsters, & it gives their system a virus which leads to a startling truth.  All I have to say about this episode is wow.  Seriously, this has one of the biggest twists I've ever seen in Power Rangers.  A+

If the other volumes 2, 3 & 5 are as good as this, I'm going to love this series.",1390780800,,2378,4.696601941747573
