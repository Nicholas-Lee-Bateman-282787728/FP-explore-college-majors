8023297,4,B00027JY4O,Well acted and entertaining.  This is a perfect example of a foreign film outclassing Hollywood on more than one front.,1359676800,,119,4.95
8023298,4,B00027JY4O,"Much like in card or board games, in the realm of movies,

there are different styles or classes,  each with a

different flavor, different approach, different visual

presentation and layout, different intellectual challenge.

In fact, BOX 507 (la caja 507), is a professionally

made, straight edge movie, with no nonsense elements that

could get it in trouble with censors, unlike in many American

productions, ( sex, violence, degradation etc.) This is a

welcome decision, as sometimes the excesses are redundant.

Therefore, the viewer is confronted with a European movie,  a

thriller with immense visual, musical elements that are

beautiful in themselves, coupled with a stimulating story.

In fact, the Costa del Sol, ( SE Coast in Spain) was

the locale chosen for this motion picture, bringing many

interesting elements of the outdoors, for those who

haven't visited the region. There is no sign of a megapolis,

such as NYC, LA, Paris, London, Amsterdam or similar, in

that area of Spain, which is actually a benefit, in my view.

We are told that, even in this spectacular area of Spain,

political corruption, payoffs and bribes exist, as well as

tight partnerships between some mob expatriates from Italy,

located in that Spanish area, and some bankers, newspaper

men, and local politicians.

It tells of ecological devastation, in exchange for

the construction and commercial development of

those areas, for purposes of tourism  (marina, high rises,

shopping centers) and the willingness of some of the elite, to

partake in this state of affairs, by either enriching themselves

admitedly or by turning a blind eye to the whole insidious process.

All in all, a beautiful European movie, perhaps a bit

simplistic at times, that will leave its mark on the

viewer by its realism. Clearly, the actors will be seen

more and more, such as the lovely Miriam Montilla, and

the very charismatic supporting actors, too.",1169337600,,1943,5.135048231511254
8023299,4,B00027JY4O,"Enrique's Urbizu's Caja 507 (Box 507) is a strong, perfectly-plotted thriller that fuses crime and political corruption seamlessly.  A bank manager's 16-year old daughter perishes while inside a tent in a forest fire and, seven years later, as the result of the robbery of the his bank, the manager discovers documents in one of the safety deposit boxes (hence the title) that relates to his daughter's death.

In the meantime, the corrupt former police chief becomes aware of these now-missing documents.  The two men each independently track down those linked to what they must find, and this tracking down is the core of this excellent thriller.  Involved here are the Mafia, corrupt officials, a sick wife, and a helpful reporter.  The relentless momentum of the plotting is truly gripping and hair-raising; this is a film that can easily stand as a brilliant model of how to write and direct a thriller.

Highly recommended.",1093132800,,929,5.03921568627451
