8241165,5,B0011ACQNW,"In Phillipe Karl's second volume, he demonstrates on several horses his ""Legerete"" or Philosophy of Ease in Gymnastics.  In this lecture, Karl demonstrates the training of the horse and an introduction in the double bridle.  He also demonstrates working the horse on the ground through the longing and jumping.  In the mounted work, he demonstrates various patterns using shoulder in, counter shoulder in, haunches in (travers) and renvers on the circles and figure 8's and also speaks about the riders seat and balance as well as the horse's. The horse is also taught these moves along a straight line.

The lessons power is evident if you know what to look for.  Such as the position of the horse's neck and legs as he moves, achieving softness and receptivity in the neck and mouth as well as learning to engage the hind end.  In this total DVD/video, the lessons are designed to teach the horse flexibility while keeping his softness in the mouth and carry himself properly without leaning on the forehand.

These classical lessons have truly transformed the total carriage and movement of my horse so that he is more balanced, flexible, and confident.  It was through these lessons that we accomplished the lightness in the half pass and as Karl said, doing these exercises is better than doing 20 half passes.  The exercises teach the horse in each component of his body: mouth, jaw, neck, shoulder, ribs, and quarters.  Instead of jamming all these demands into ""one stupid move"" as Karl says, he teaches the horse these elements separately and teaches the rider to learn how to que the horse properly so it won't be confusing to the horse and thus reduce the anxiety and bracing tendency of the horse.

Again, these lessons are great exercises and wonderful for the classical rider but not necessarily the best for competative dressage because the total form and look of the classical horse is somewhat different than the competative horse of today's contemporary dressage.  It is good if one could implement the exercises to truly create flexibility and elevation of the horse so the horse has the skills to move in self carriage.  The truth is in the horse - and as you watch Phillipe Karl in his training, the horse's appear to be calm and balanced instead of full of anxiety.  This is the work horse of his complete series and is unmatched by any other DVD's I've seen.",1200700800,17,2381,4.803921568627451
