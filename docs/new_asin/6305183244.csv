977572,3,6305183244,Even though the acting isn't that great from the main stars of the movie I still enjoyed watching this movie very much brings back memories from when I was a kid. For the price of 17.99 its not a bad addition to anyones collection.,1207440000,,231,4.2727272727272725
977573,3,6305183244,"This movie had a lot of potential. It could have been a fun adventure, but someone really blew it! The most obvious and glaring problem with this movie is the ridiculously poor theme song. I've heard a lot of annoying theme songs, but this one is so bad that I just can't fathom how anyone could have allowed it in the movie. The other main flaw has to do with casting. The actors playing the kids do a good job and the actors playing the Japanese soldiers do a good job, but the two leads just don't cut it. It may be poor acting, bad script writing, or bad directing, but something just doesn't click when the two lead actors engage in any kind of dialogue. Every word they say comes across as awkward and unnatural. All that being said, the kids and the actors playing the Japanese soldiers do come through with strong performances, it's just too bad that the two leads couldn't support their efforts a little more. Actually, the director should have just focused more on the kids and left the adults in the background. This movie really deserves to be remade (or if there is enough extra footage, re-edited!). It was a great idea that just wasn't executed to its full potential!",1148774400,,1182,4.476851851851852

977575,3,6305183244,"The Last Flight of Noah's Ark is about two strangers, two young children,and animals on a plane that crashes. They all end up on a remote island. The movie is good for family fun, but is a little unrealistic and is very predictable. It is unrealistic in the shark scene because the shark was moving too slowly and the water was too shallow. Also, the storm scene did not show the damage that it should have shown. Noah's Ark was predictable by the ""boy - meets - girl - falls - in - love - and - marries"" scene. In addition, nothing really bad happens. The movie is good to show how families come together and work together. Great for a Saturday afternoon, or a classroom.",1097712000,3,672,4.341269841269841
977576,3,6305183244,"Elliott Gould stars as an impecunious pilot who ,in order to stay one step ahead of two strong arm men anxious to collect his gambling debts ,reluctantly agrees to fly a cargo of animals to a remote Pacific island in the company of a nun ,Sister Bernadette (Genevieve Bujold).She has conceived the idea of importing the livestock as a way of converting the islanders to a farming existence .
Omens are not propitious-the plane is old and rickety ; Gould is unenthusiastic about animals;Gould and Bujold clash and two pre-teenage children stowaway on the plane .
The plane goes offcourse and Gould is forced to ditch on a remote island which -just to complicate matters -is occupied by two Japanese naval officers who have not heard that World War two is over ,and who attack the plane without success.
The bulk of the movie shows how the parties combine in an attempt to escape from the island and how the internal conflicts are resolved.
Nicely shot on location in Hawaii and with a strong performance from the underrated Bujold ,this watchable movie is acceptable family fare but would have been all the better for a livelier actor in the lead role .Gould lacks the lightness of touch that Disney regulars from this era  like Garner or Dean Jones would have brought to proceedings.
Solid and watchable but second string Disney.",1069027200,11,1329,4.778260869565218
977577,4,6305183244,A solid family movie with enough action to hold the entire familys interest.  Outstanding photography with a good professional cast.  Recommended for all film libraries.,992995200,5,169,5.72
977578,4,6305183244,"Elliott Gould  gives another great performance as the world weary, hard drinking loner (ala `Getting Straight', `The Long Goodbye', `MASH'), but similar to his other early eighties foray into Disney films `The Devil and  Max Devlin', his loner character is tested and softened through unexpected  events. Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold also sticks to previous performances as the  determined and sexy emissary of good (`Coma', `Earthquake').  Both leads  give a nice edge to this adventurous tale, made at a time when Disney was  making some interestingly cast and original live action films like `The  Black Hole', `Amy' and `TRON'.  Rick Schroder, in the prime of his  childhood acting career, plays virtually the same character as he did in  `The Champ'.  All of this cinematic pedigree adds a wonderfully  entertaining element to a film that could have dived into the painfully  mawkish.  Complete with night shark attacks, stranded Japanese soldiers,  orphans, an eclectic menagerie of animals (who ever sees a mallard duck in  the same vicinity as one of those hump backed African ox), and a great  South Pacific setting this film has something for everyone.  A guaranteed  good night with nods to the adults and thrills and adventure for the kids.  Hearkens back to a not particularly distant past when Disney was making  wholesome original films with a little edge.
As always Anchor Bay does  a beautiful job in the DVD transfer, giving more time and respect to  Disney's library than Disney does for its own films.  As with all Anchor  Bay DVDs, highly recommended.",961286400,15,1567,5.119047619047619

As the film began, I didn't think that much of it, wondering why I'd liked it.  This is a film that you have to give a little time to.  It takes a while for all the characters to get together and mix.  Once we get to know them and see them interact with each other, as viewers, we begin to care about them and get sucked into the story.  So what began for me as a big yawn turned into a film that held my interest, made me care, and entertained me.  The cast does an excellent job, and wow, does Elliot Gould look young!

977874,5,6305183244,"In 1980 I was an 11-year old who was immersed in World War Two history; especially the aircraft. By the close of the 1970's I knew the B-29 was a rarity, and living at the time in Mesa Arizona I had seen many B-17 slurry bombers (converted), a B-24 and a number of other aircraft fly over my home. But the B-29 was rare. Suffice to say when I saw the trailer for 'Last Flight of Noah's Ark' on TV I was excited! Once the film hit the theaters in Mesa, I got the money from my Mom and rode my bike, (by myself) the 2 miles to the cinema. (Near the old Tri-city Mall for the locals) Seeing that B-29 on screen was, for me, the equivalent of seeing Elvis in-person. It was very special. The flying sequences with the bomber in-flight in this film are some of the most amazing shots ever captured of a B-29 in flight... Beautiful, fantastic work. After the first viewing, I again solicited the funds from Mom and went to see this movie again (by myself) about a month later- I enjoyed it even more and those memories will forever stay with me.

Now, 35 years later I rediscovered this film through Amazon, guessing my 8 year old son would probably enjoy it. This was  the present from me to him for his 8th birthday and I must say, for so many reasons I never realized in 1980, this film is a goldmine. It has: WW2 Bomber, a Christian message, Humanity, Sailing, Sharks, Comedy, Action, Drama, tears. My son loves Sharks and this simple Disney film really delivered in one brief but thrilling segment.

I recommend the film. As an 11 year old it was one of my all-time favorites for many good reasons. As a 46 year old Christian Dad it exceeded my ""matured"" expectations completely and still stands up as a quality Disney film , family friendly and fun with a solid message and serious action and excitement. For my 8 year old Titanic-U Boat-Naval History Shark-Loving son it was very enjoyable and watchable.

Only gripe: The DVD package says Standard format *and* Widescreen. In actuality there is no Widescreen on the DVD itself and no options for screen format. It is the standard screen format only. Unfortunate as this is (I really was hoping for widescreen viewing) it doesn't take away from the film, and my 5-Star rating survives!",1439510400,7,2235,4.45721271393643

during World War II.  When the Last Flight of Noah's Ark debuted, he asserted there was some truth that the fuselage of a B-29, could float
upside down?!  In addition, on Islands in the Pacific, although WW II was over for years, Japanese soldiers continued to be found alive and
finally surrendered?!  This Movie was produced in the late 1970s - and Walt Disney studios discovered young talent like Ricky Schroder.

978119,3,6305183244,"A down on his luck pilot named Noah Dugan, in need of some fast cash to pay off a dangerous gambling debt, takes on the job of flying a wreck of a plane loaded with animals, a female missionary, and two stowaway orphans to a remote island. The group's plans are changed, however, when they end up straying off course and are forced to land on an uncharted island inhabited only by a pair of forgotten Japanese soldiers lost for 35 years and under the impression that WWII is still going on. Befriending the soldiers and learning to get along themselves is only the first part of their struggle, as the group from the ""Noah's Ark"" also must find a way to get back to civilization with only their now permanently grounded plane to use as transportation.

Elliott Gould stars as Dugan and Bernadette Lafleur his unlikely love interest in this Disney family adventure from 1980. It also co-starred a very young Ricky Schroeder and Tammy Lauren as the two children taken under Noah's wing. John Fujioka and Yuki Shimoda round out the main cast as the pair of eventually friendly Japanese soldiers. ""The Last Flight of Noah's Ark"" is a film loved by many Disney fans and not so praiseworthy to others. I am afraid I have to fall in the latter group. I happen to be a huge fan of Disney, especially classic Disney, unquestionably including classic Disney live-action. There aren't a lot of classic Disney bigscreen releases I haven't seen yet nor that I haven't seen in a LONG time. When I finally got around to putting in my newly acquired DVD of Disney's Last Flight of Noah's Ark though, I hadn't seen it since I was a child and really didn't have much of an idea what to expect. I was optimistic. I usually love Disney live-action pre-dating the late-90's. There are rare exceptions though when a film is just okay and not, in my opinion, endowed with much ""Disney Magic"". This is one of those times when the film I was watching was definitely just okay. It has its good points, and it has definitely low points. I was very turned off early on by the fact that I didn't really like any of the characters. All they did was bicker. It was flat out irritating. I realize the point of the plot is seeing how all these very different people end up forming a little family when they have no choice, but I just didn't enjoy hearing these people complain constantly, particularly the main stars, Gould and Lafleur. The pair didn't really have much chemistry to me either. The kids at least were great actors (though I still found Schroeder's bickering irritating, while I normally don't like Lauren but she is a total sweetheart here), and the Japanese soldier characters were both excellent actors and fun characters. They definitely added a lot to this movie. There are fun and exciting moments too, including a part with a shark, but there were also times when I felt I didn't get enough info. The situation with the gambling debt is never resolved. There's a scene where they are about to kill a pet steer to put him out of his misery, but he is fine moments later after the execution is thankfully interrupted. And I'm forgetting some stuff as well, I'm sure. The worst thing about ""Last Flight of Noah's Ark"" though, is the horrible late 70's/early 80's theme song. Ugh. It is painful to endure. Frankly, after seeing this, I'm very worried about how I'm going to feel when I finally acquire and view Gould's other Disney film from a year later, ""The Devil and Max Devlin"". At least that one co-stars a young Bill Cosby though.

The DVD release of Last Flight of Noah's Ark doesn't fair much better in my review. The print is too dark and there are no bonus features unless you count the option of fullscreen or non-anamorphic widescreen. At least we do get a widescreen option. I've actually seen worse Disney live-action catalog releases.

When all is said and done, this isn't an unwatchable film. As I said, it has its good points, but as a Disney live-action classic, for me it's near the bottom of the list. Pros: A good message, some good acting, a few good scenes and ideas. Cons, a difficult to believe romance between stars I found irritating (it seemed like they were going for a Han Solo kinda thing with Gould's character, but it just wasn't working for me, nothing against him), a story that felt a little anticlimactic and had some holes, and an absolutely horrendous theme song. I'd say give this one a watch if there is something drawing you to it, whether it's a cast member, the fact that it is a Disney film, or whatever else. There is a fair chance you will be in the group that loves this film. It seems to be an even split. But, I don't think you will find it anything groundbreaking at any rate. It's fair enough as simple but not too fantastic family entertainment, but there are much better out there under the Disney name. Try a Dean Jones, Hayley Mills, Tommy Kirk, Kurt Russell, or Fred MacMurray selection instead. Save this one for after you've seen all those Disney classics.",1301184000,,5002,4.561735261401557
978120,3,6305183244,"I saw this movie SEVERAL times (lost count) when it played at the local theater by my home when it came out.
I was then, as I am now, a HUGE WWII buff, and the involvement of the B-29 alone made me excited for this film.
The ranking Japanese officer's explaination of where he learned English (""Creve-rand"" aka ""Cleveland"") had me in stitches then as it does now.
NOT out of disrespect for the Japanese, but out of understanding that ""some people in this world are different than we (Americans) are""!
Hey, cheesy and ""family-friendly"" are what Disney does, with the exception of ""The Black Hole""; thankfully I was young enough to NOT know how dark THAT movie really was at the time of its release! Loved it all the same, had the action figure of Maximillian the robot...",1281052800,,770,4.546762589928058

I've never heard anything about this movie (either before, or since we watched it years ago)  I was really excited to find it on DVD so my grandkids could watch it.  My grown son also wants to watch it again.  A great family movie!",1241049600,7,307,4.224137931034483

7884448,5,6305183244,"An older Disney movie, with 2 excellent actors, Elliott Gould and Genevieve Bujold. Gould owes money to some hoodlums and agrees to pilot an old WW11 bomber for Bujold who is a missionary. On the plane are 2 young children, one played by a very young Ricky Shroder. Also on the plane are numerous animals. They are caught in a storm and forced to land on an island. Very soon they discover 2 Japanese soldiers who haven't discovered the war has been over for over 30 years. Together they turn the plane into a boat and float off the island looking to find Hawaii. Excellent movie hasn't aged at all. Highly recommended. Good for all ages.",1480982400,,638,4.508620689655173
