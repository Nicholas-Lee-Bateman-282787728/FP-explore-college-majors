But Krammers lectures on C-Span is a  more thorough treatment of the subject.",1389830400,,165,4.892857142857143
8371855,4,B002KBI4UA,"One of the principles in this documentary, Hermann Blumhardt, was a man I had interviewed several times for some of my own projects.
When Hitler took Germany to war, Hermann was an apprenticed printer and musician who only wanted to live his life in peace. What made
his story so interesting to me was his sincerity and forthright delivery as given in this film.
The title was selected by a book publisher to sensationalize the project at a time when war documentraies began to appear in clusters.
As with other similar projects, the main body of film in this one is stock footage culled from film libraries in Europe and the U.S. and does not
always match the story line; for example, there is a pan of General Paulus pictured in an American POW camp when he was actually in a POW
 camp in Russia when he was filmed. Details aside, this film does a good job of preserving the testimony of ordinary soldiers who found
themselves enjoying the hospitality of their enemy while awaiting the worst possible outcome in their homeland. This is a worthy addition
to the library on any serious collector.",1283472000,,1096,4.649484536082475
