8250873,5,B0013GJU10,I so enjoy this workout that I combine it with treadmill and elliptical. Suzy gives me the enthusiasm to exercise!!,1483833600,,115,4.8
8250874,5,B0013GJU10,"Suzy Stone was a great role model. I started teaching aerobics myself in the early 90's after taking a Freedanse II workshop with her. She was a great inspiration and the sole reason for my own fitness career. I am glad to see she has put forth her knowledge and enthusiasm into her successful kidz program...Both my husband and I were big fans and are to this day. We were so excited to find this video again on the internet as we had lost our original copy. It is fun, creative, upbeat and a great workout!",1279065600,,508,4.302083333333333
