8708301,1,B00UU5KLUO,It is really not for spinning training and very annoying motorbike sounds. For me the best for indie cycling Mat Dogg and Mindy Mylrea,1520121600,,134,4.625
8708302,5,B00UU5KLUO,"I have a few dvds from the series and this one happens to be my favorite. Amazing scenery, good soundtrack ( I think some of the nature sounds are mixed in), and good pace on this one. The three different rides loop so you can have any length workout and start on any ride. One is fast, one medium and one slow to medium.

There is no music, no instruction but thats what I like about it. It looks spectacular on a 55 screen. I don't think its boring at all, its very realistic",1509408000,,477,4.074468085106383
8708303,4,B00UU5KLUO,Very Happy with the speed / pace and the scenery.  The videography is done well.  Though I have only watched the first two rides - it did seem to end oddly - as if the bike was still moving.,1503014400,,190,3.8461538461538463
8708304,4,B00UU5KLUO,"As realistic as you can get with a ""virtual"" ride.  It even has the motorcycle sounds as they pass you, etc.  Nice scenery and it also has you going through little villas with pedestrians/patrons at the little shops.  Very enjoyable, actually.",1457568000,,243,4.878048780487805
8708305,5,B00UU5KLUO,"This DVD features spectacular mountain scenery including jagged, rocky-shaped formations.  I find this disc can be used for my walking exercise (at a fast pace) but, as it says, it is principally a cycle ride rather than a walk.  I enjoy going through the villages with their charming buildings set amongst verdant green hillsides and the lovely pine trees growing all around.  It is marvellous also to experience the sights and sounds of the fast-flowing river running down through the valley.  As well as the sound of the river, there is also wonderful, melodious birdsong coming from all around.

In the first ride there is an abundance of motorcyclists taking in the sights of this picturesque part of the world.  I find this disc has a great summery feel, and it is an invigorating help for my exercise sessions as they pass happily and I am spurred on to continue.",1432598400,,870,4.766666666666667
8708306,5,B00UU5KLUO,"With this DVD the workout on an exercise bike makes a lot more fun, especially for those who want to pedal properly. With cycle 1 and 2 you can exercise in a very fast pace on the mountain roads of the Dolomites. You get company from many other cyclists and motorcycles that are also traveling on this route. One drives past cliffs, some of which are still covered with snow, then back to green meadows with the mountain peaks of the Dolomites in the background. Here the sky is bright blue, with small white clouds, a magnificent scenery. In cycle 3 it gets a little more comfortable. You drive past green meadows, come through small towns, but always with the peaks of the Dolomites in the background. The videos on this DVD are all provided with natural sounds, which gave me the feeling of actually being there. You could hear the noise of passing motorcycles, but also birdsong and ringing of bells. The unique landscape and the magnificent colors make your workout something special.",1430784000,3,989,4.689655172413793
8708307,4,B00UU5KLUO,"I will start with what I liked:  Ride # 3!  Beautiful moderately paced ride down in a valley, surrounded by imposing snow-capped mountains, green fields, pine trees and beautiful hamlets with alpine style chalets.  I give this Ride 5 stars!  However, I did not like Rides # 1 and # 2, mostly because you travel at a very fast speed, mainly downhill along windy roads, which actually made me slightly dizzy.  The scenery is breathtaking, however I could not quite enjoy it because of the speed.  These roads have some traffic (mainly motorbikes).  Rides # 1 and # 2 will definitely appeal to those wanting to ride downhill fast, but they weren't for me.  You can watch a trailer of this DVD (and many other) on the producers website www.worldnaturevideo.com and also purchase individual digital downloads of any of these rides.  I definitely recommend Ride # 3!!",1430006400,,861,4.802721088435374
8708308,5,B00UU5KLUO,"Lovely views of the Italian Dolomites.  It feels like you are actually riding through the mountains, by a stream complete with the relaxing sounds of a babbling water and through a colorful village along your journey.  There are three different ""rides"" to choose from and each is an enjoyable adventure.  This dvd adds some spice to an otherwise mundane exercise routine.  One of the scenes is high in the mountains and gives the feel of a ride amongst the pine trees and craggy snow capped peaks.  This video includes sounds of wind, streams and birds which is very realistic.  Oh, and be careful on your ride as there is even traffic some that pass by rather quickly.
I highly recommend this video for anyone looking for something interesting to watch during your exercise routine.  It is also great for just relaxing.  I own several of the Tony Helsloot/World Nature Videos and they are all high quality products with great sound and video.",1429574400,3,943,4.777777777777778
