8297383,1,B001EAWMMO,"Completely pathetic. The nuns were one of the original punk bands, formed in the 1970s. Early-era member Jennifer Miro started playing shows in NYC with a new Nuns in the 1990s with original member Jeff Olener, Miro got a massive boob job, and they eventually got rid of the musicians they were playing with to form what was basically a very lame excuse for a softcore sex show. Members, including Miro, died and this DVD documents what an embarrassment the Nuns turned into.",1421798400,2,475,4.734939759036145
8297384,3,B001EAWMMO,More of a cult work if you know anything about the scene and what was going on at that time - not for general consumption. But if you know any of what lies behind then it is worth it.,1418428800,,183,3.717948717948718
8297385,5,B001EAWMMO,"I LOVED it! A must have for any fan. It's humorous, entertaining, and overall enjoyable. Long live The Nuns! One of the greatest bands of all time!",1412208000,,147,4.481481481481482
8297386,1,B001EAWMMO,"I am very sorry that I purchased this DVD; I kept waiting for the movie to start, but the grany madness continued! It is not a movie about vampire nums draining people as they pray for them at all! Save your money, do not purchase this dvd, unless you are into this sort of madness.",1289001600,,282,4.1454545454545455
8297387,5,B001EAWMMO,"Great songs and music. Very seductive and compelling for those who like the dark side of punk music. My favorites are ""White Slave"" and ""Maitresse De Satan"". Not for everyone but I recommend this album for those that do. Highly erotic and very enjoyable. I hope this group will have new releases.",1285632000,,296,4.711538461538462
8297388,4,B001EAWMMO,"You could easily write 2 completely different reviews for the Nun's DVD & be equally correct. Let me explain. I am a Nun's fan & it seemed like every week for a couple of years this DVD was going to come out. Frankly I had thrown in the towel, flat out given up, it wasn't going to happen but then It did. Faced with this miracle of sorts it would be easy to rate this 5 stars but would it be right? Simply No! Even though it is the only Nun's DVD out there I have to call it like it is. Basically ""The Nuns"" that Mistress jennifer leads was a Punk Rock group that was Bay area originated. It started in the late 70's & over the years has morphed into more a Gothic/hard rock/S&M inspired performance troupe. Only Jeff Olener & Jennifer Miro( Anderson) remain from the initial band.
Now to the DVD. Mistress Jennifer provides an audio introduction to the contents of this DVD & there is a written history for you as well. There are parts of 3 concerts ( 1 in NYC & 2 from London)presented. All three suffer from the same malaise & it's that the camera is so close you don't get a good perspective as to what you're watching. You may see Jennifer from the waist up or 5 of 10 people on stage or a shot from the floor that shows nothing. Granted the lighting in these clubs ( or lack of same) probably contributed. It seems during these endeavors according to Jennifer uncertainty was the common denominator. They worried about being busted by the police, they worried as well about other female participants too as nudity in some venues was a no no but once things started the rule book seemingly went out the window. Jennifer intimated in their search for beautiful women they hired first & found out what they had later. THere is a lot of stuff on this DVD. There are pictorials & erotic shots of Jennifer as recent as galleries in 2007 & 2008 & a string of Lobby Cards/promotional posters that gives you a feel of what went down before. There is a short film entitled Drusilla where Jen displays her acting chops by plugging herself into 3 different characters. It didn't make the grade as far as I was concerned. As well there is a failed package of 2 episodes of New York Vampires that according to mistress Jennifer was shopped to MTV & was close to becoming a purchase. Given the number of Vampire shows out now you have to feel just being a few years ahead of their time cost them. The trailer for the movie is fine & ""white Slave"" promo video is good. Keep in mind as well most of the music from the On Stage performances is primarily from 3 or 4 Nun's tunes & don't look at this as a video CD because it isn't. Following Jennifer's thoughts their performances involved out-doing themselves ( translated meaning= winging it!)each time out. 4 stars for being a can't help myself fan, if your new to this probably 3 & check out the New York Vampires CD first so you can gauge if you're up for the challenge!",1283558400,3,2913,4.3272394881170015
8297389,1,B001EAWMMO,"i bought this on amazon's recommendation ""PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THIS, ALSO BOUGHT"".  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!  i enjoyed DECADENT EVIL II, but NUNS and GHOULS GONE WILD are pure MONEY WASTING GARBAGE!!!!!!!please don't group these things if you don't know what you're doing.",1268870400,,264,5.414634146341464
8297390,5,B001EAWMMO,"Just had the chance to view the long awaited NUNS DVD. Wow. What a great way to see them. Having been to most of their NYC events, and being able to chat with them from time to time, BAT CAVE, Long Black Veil ect, it was great to see them again.
This was a time before HD Video, but I'm not spoiled, as I got to glimps into some of thier inner lives, and revisit the concerts.
A great video, long time in comming, and worth the wait.
Thanks Misstriss Jennifer.

8297391,4,B001EAWMMO,"After delay upon delay the Nuns dvd finally has an american release. Original founding members the stunning mistress Jennifer Anderson ,Jeff Olener and a gaggle of gorgous goth girls strut their stuff for your pleasure and their own if you like it or not.

you get live music segments, ie nyc's limelight and some from the infamous "" black mass "" gigs/events in london. You get reality show pilots that were too good to be picked up ,ie ' too adult ', bittersweet footage of the too soon to be departed Miss Kris , plenty of still photos and all sorts of Nunmania.

This lifelong fan would have liked a little more of an introspective view to do justice as to why I fell in love with them  in the first place but as dvds go, there's Nun better.  Jennifer,  all the love in the world, Bruce",1228521600,2,789,4.340136054421769
