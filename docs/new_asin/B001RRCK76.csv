8338663,3,B001RRCK76,"Put my first review in the seller feedback section - sorry! I had a hard time finding the ""Pilates"" movement in this CD. It did not seem Pilates like at all but it is good to get the body moving.",1474934400,,195,3.9
8338664,4,B001RRCK76,"This is very, very low impact and you barely lose your breath doing any of the moves. The two standing workouts are quite different which is nice, and the chair is really only used at the end to cool down and stretch, or for balance if you need it. She uses a ball of some sort in both sessions, but you don't need the ball. Each session is about 26 minutes. This is for people - I assume - who have injuries and cannot be jumping around. The ""exercises"" are very low impact, not even really exercise, just stretches. Her music and scenery is awful - a dark living room and dark rug - but it works for me. As someone with severe back pain I can't do much more than this, and the stretches are good for my back. It's not pilates but uses some of the same stretches.",1417305600,,764,4.1
8338665,5,B001RRCK76,"I suffered a bad ankle sprain a few months ago.  I started using Susan Tuttle's Chair Pilates and Chair Resistance Bands.  I loved these workouts because I feel safe doing the exercises, I get a lot stretching to include my hands and fingers and all the workouts are fun.  Now that I have enough strength to stand for longer periods of time, I've been doing the Standing Pilates.  This DVD also has two 30 minute workouts and I like them both.  What I like about this workout and her others is that you get great stretching and core work.  The workouts are  continuous, you never stop moving.  The workouts are gentle, and the 30 minutes fly by quickly.  I feel like I have retrained my body and in a few weeks I will be able to do more challenging cardio and weight workouts.  Other than that, I'm not sure if these are Pilates workouts.  Also, the music is the same on all of these dvds, but it's fun and upbeat so I don't mind.",1374019200,3,930,4.287356321839081
8338666,5,B001RRCK76,Materials arrived on time and in fine condition.  The exercises augmented what I was doing already.  I was going on vacation and couldn't get to my exercise classes at the fitness center.,1359244800,,187,4.8125
8338667,1,B001RRCK76,"I understand this is for seniors and people with low mobility (I have fractures in my spine and neck myself) but I have a couple of issues with this.

1. This is in NO WAY pilates. Too much rocking and bouncing to even be close. I bought it based on the description saying it is ""standing pilates"". So I was very unhappy once I watched it.

2. Like I said I have my own intense mobility issues, but I feel it should be made much more clear to the consumer just how incredibly low impact this video is. I would definitely recommend it to my friend who works as the activies director for a nursing home or my other friend who works in physical therapy (she helps people who have been in horrific accidents re-learn how to do everyday activities.) It would be fantastic in those settings.

For a person just strictly looking for low impact cardio or low impact pilates--this is NOT the video for you. It makes me sick that I spent $20 on this video. I might as well have just set fire to my money.",1346889600,2,994,4.248677248677248
8338668,5,B001RRCK76,"I've tried so many beginner pilates videos and each one left me in a ball of pain, especially in the neck. Not ""the happy I burned some calories kinda pain"" but the ""no one, especially not me, should be doing this without supervision pain."" Funny considering pilates was meant for people like me! I've owned, watched, done, returned and regifted many for this reason.

I decided to give ""Standing Pilates"" a shot figuring that if it's for ""older people"" (I'm 30!) and people with mobility issues (I do have some because of severe fibromyalgia and joint hypermobility syndrome), I would be less likely to hurt myself doing this 30-minute workout.

Well, I was right. I get the workout I need, feel those endorphins churning, push myself a little but without pulling or hurting any sensitive areas. I found myself chuckling with Susan through the workout, smiling at the musical choices and the 30 minutes flew by while still making me feel like I got a good (but careful on my joints and sensitive areas) workout.

This is one of the best pilates videos ever.",1294704000,12,1058,4.739130434782608
