8744034,5,B0195GUZ6I,"This is a comprehensive project and incorporates the four symphonies, the piano and violin concertos and the two overtures. The recordings were made in 2014 and 2015 with the symphonies 2-3 recorded on tour in London and Vienna and the remainder recorded in Cleveland. The quality of the recordings is consistently fine despite the variations of place, time and video directors.

There are bonus interviews given by the conductor and the two soloists in response to silent subtitled questions. These questions are probing and are given informative and clear responses with reasons. The subjects covered include questions of interpretation, relationships and mutual co-operation and provide much inside information as to how these recordings came about and what they were intended to convey.

Franz Welser-Most describes both of the soloists that he has chosen to work with as no nonsense musicians and, as such, they seem to be ideal partners. The conductor has worked with both sufficiently often for there to be considerable mutual knowledge and respect. In the case of Bronfman the relationship goes back 22 years and includes many performances of these two piano concertos. In terms of the Brahms idiom, Welser-Most likens his Austrian approach to that of the Austrian version of the German language where there is warmth and no harsh edges. His aim is to achieve pure beauty and there is a notable emphasis upon the singing line coupled with a fluid and forward momentum. This results in natural tensions rather than imposed ones.

The orchestra is praised by both soloists who comment about its responsiveness and its chamber-like ability to listen and to react to each other as if being just one person. These features are readily apparent throughout these recordings. The two overtures and the violin concerto are given energetic and bold performances and these are the two emotions that dominate. The two piano concertos are less so and this is particularly true of the second concerto which is centred around the final grazioso movement. Welser-Most explains this need by describing the work as a journey which, ending in this way, must therefore travel in a manner that makes that conclusion natural. Bronfman delivers an inherently lyrical solo part working closely with the orchestral solo instruments and this works very well. A similar approach is adopted with the first concerto while being just that bit more demonstrative as is appropriate. Julia Fischers account of the violin concerto is very bold and full of energy. The giocoso element of the final movement is not stressed in the way that Gill Shaham does with Abbado for instance.

The four symphonies make a notably compelling and satisfying unity with the lyrical line always uppermost and held within a forward pulse. The strings in particular are able to sing with a silky sheen in the higher reaches of the first symphony and the upper brass are able to cut through with bright but not domineering nature. The strings in general are able to deliver a depth of tone in tutti passages that would match any other orchestra including that of the BPO. Their pianissimo playing can be breathtakingly effective in an accompanying role. The woodwind are uniformly excellent. It is easy to understand why this orchestra maintains such a high reputation both nationally and internationally.

In common with much current practice, the string layout has both sets of violins to the left, the cellos centre, the violas on the right and the basses on the right behind the violas. This is a regular pattern used these days and delivers a well-balanced live stage sound. It also emphasises the desirability of playback equipment to have same sized centre speakers to match the main left and right so that the stage emphasis is naturally reproduced at home. The sound is presented in excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 as well as stereo. The balance faithfully delivers the stage layout with the emphasis upon the centre stage for much of the orchestra and where the left and right channels act as extensions to this aural image. There is good depth of field. The camera work is excellent in Cleveland, in London and in Vienna with crisp imaging. The Vienna colour range has a slight yellow cast when compared to the other two venues but the eyes soon adjust.

In conclusion this very comprehensive set offers fine value both financially and musically and has the added advantage of excellently informative and interesting bonus material that goes a long way to explain the decisions made when preparing this set of performances.

There is no direct alternative to this set at present but any newcomers will be hard pressed to match it, let alone to supersede it.",1450483200,6,4724,5.033248081841432
