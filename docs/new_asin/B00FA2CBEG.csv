5972812,3,B00FA2CBEG,"This was a movie that focused on one's self belief that if you want something to happen so badly, it will - you just have to keep looking until you find it. The main actor Joseph Philips was brilliantly cast as the boy who never gave up no matter how despairing it seemed at times. The supporting group of actors added to the storyline but sadly for me, it seemed to drift along rather than create real magic out of love. It was a peasant enough movie to watch but if you are expecting lots of christmas cheer and familiar christmas fuzziness you won't find it here. That said, it was quite refreshing.",1399161600,3,602,4.336283185840708
5972813,4,B00FA2CBEG,"A very sensitive and emotional Christmas film. The character Susan is most intriguing. She could represent an angel in some form.
The whole family enjoyed the film and have recommended it to many others.",1390176000,,203,5.0
5972814,2,B00FA2CBEG,"I bought this because I love Christmas movies.  I did not enjoy this movie, it was slow and poorly acted. This of course is not the sellers fault.",1390089600,8,146,4.214285714285714
5972815,1,B00FA2CBEG,"This movie had no plot. It was so boring! For a Christmas movie, it had no touchy feely good feeling that all holiday movies hold. I would not recommend this movie for anyone!",1389139200,9,175,4.333333333333333
5972816,1,B00FA2CBEG,"The only nice thing about this dvd is the fact that there are lovely shots of London at Christmas time.  Other than that there is absolutely nothing to recommend it.  The story is ludicrous and barely holds together.  I suppose the actors do their best with the material but this is definitely one of those films that has you watching the clock and wondering ""How did something this bad get made?""",1387584000,10,397,4.563380281690141

5972818,4,B00FA2CBEG,A nice Christmas movie for all the family. I watched it with my kids who liked the young lead actor and the feel good story. Timothy Spall gave a great performance and we enjoyed the bits with Brenda Blethyn. Worth a look over the holidays.,1385683200,4,240,4.355555555555555

5972820,2,B00FA2CBEG,"Two stars because I was able to force myself to watch it all.  I preordered it.  I don't think I will do that again, both of them were horrible.  I would have been disappointed if I bought it used for .01 and had to pay shipping and handling.",1385337600,9,242,4.0

8613632,1,B00FA2CBEG,"A truly awful movie. You would think there'd be more effort put into the script with such amazing actors, but even they couldn't make it happen.",1416614400,3,144,4.576923076923077
