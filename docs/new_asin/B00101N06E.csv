8236491,4,B00101N06E,"The file the documents the initial history of the USS Yorktown and some of the battles it was involved in very well. There are some breaks in the film where each section was made a part of the total; but they are short.
It is definitely worth seeing for those who want to know the history of the USS Yorktown.",1413504000,,309,4.166666666666667
8236492,5,B00101N06E,"I first saw this film when I was in Navy boot camp back in 1970. I later saw it when I toured the battleship U.S.S. Massachusetts, it's the film they show in the lower aft berthing area on the TV. I looked for it for a long time to add to my collection, and now I have it. Well worth the money for anyone interested in the U.S. Navy during WW2.",1235520000,2,344,3.859154929577465
8236493,5,B00101N06E,"The Documentary:
The Fighting Lady is an Oscar-winning (Best Documentary (Feature), 1944) 1944 U.S. Navy film about the U.S.S. Yorktown. It is shot in color from a 16mm camera with narrated audio/dialog.

This is a very interesting look at life on board a U.S. Navy Aircraft Carrier during World War II. We see not only elements of day-to-day life but the waiting in ready rooms, scrambling to get in the air for engagements and bombardments and the returns from battle.

The film opens with the landing of the ship's planes shortly after the ship was launched. We also see action at: Marcus Island, Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Truk Islands, and Philippine Sea. This action is filmed from the airplane's cameras and includes bombing footage as well as strafing/fighting.

The DVD:
The quality of the DVD is quite good. The colors remain strong and vibrant. There are film lines and spots of damage, especially on shots from the airplanes themselves.

One thing I found funny but could irritate others is you actually see where the reels change including serial numbers and reel titles.

This is quite a good transfer, even if it is not perfect.

The sound is very good and synchronized well to the film.

There are no extras and no menus. The film starts when you load the disc and immediately repeats after the end.

Thanks to the National Archives and Amazon for releasing this one in a more official edition than what was previously available. I highly recommend this edition to anyone who is interested.",1204416000,5,1533,4.891891891891892
