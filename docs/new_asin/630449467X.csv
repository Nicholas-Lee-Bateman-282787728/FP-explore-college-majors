7873093,5,630449467X,"had to watch this twice but was worth the buy,great movie ,Denis Leary  and Joe Mantegna  work good together and should make more movies like this. its sort of a gangster movie but from the 90's before they became shit",1376092800,,218,4.425
7873094,3,630449467X,"This was a pretty decent flick by Larry Bishop (son of Rat Packer Joey Bishop). While I've always been a fan of Joe & Dennis, this film was just a bit too slow paced, but not bad overall. Definitely worth the price, though.",1294444800,,223,4.209302325581396

7873096,3,630449467X,"I saw this movie at my friend Joel's house, and the first time I saw it I didn't get it but I got it the 2nd time. I was half asleep the first time, anywho, It's just about Leary and he kills all these guys who tried to kill his dad and he's especially looking around for a man named Richard Essex( Joe Mantegna), now Mantegna is Frank and Leary is Johnny Crown or Johnny Alt, the 2 have a bunch of nicknames. Larry Bishop is Ned Lynch( Bishop also wrote the screenplay) and later he kills LEary's father and then there's all this mobsterinbetween stuff.  Leary takes Mantegna to see Anabella Sciorra for therapy, becuase the two had been in love and by this movie they still are( Mantegna is a lady's man, let's say that). Leary has an insider who kills off his ""hit list"" and Mantegna and Leary go around doing Leary's "" things to do list"". Leary knows Mantegna's Essex but he doesnt want to tell him. They go to The Underworld where Leary, Mantegna are up against Bishop and Jimmie F. Skaggs( Leary's insider, but who turns on him). This movie is very violent and very bloody. I don't know how manguys get killed in the beginning but Leary just plows um over like sushi. lot's of twists and turns and the story keeps itself up there. Abe Vigoda( who plays Mantegna's father) is never cooler.",1063238400,2,1294,4.369294605809128
7873097,4,630449467X,"I originally saw the tail end of this film on cable television, many years after it was released, but upon re-viewing, found it to be a great exercise in satire--namely, the mob movie scene.  It borrows large doses of Tarantino, but remains strictly a Denis Leary feature.
Whether or not that's a bonus is up to you, but he's on the money in this film.  There are a few exchanges that had me gut laughing in their inanity, and even if the film's a bit too long, I still think it belongs in the guilty pleasure box.",1041984000,,514,4.288659793814433
7873098,4,630449467X,"I think this movie is pretty damn good for what it is. Its a pulp crime story about a guy who gets out of jail and starts talking care of old business.  Things aren't ever that easy, and with a sub plot in tow, violence breaks out around every turn. If you liked Leary in suicide kings  then you should like this. I'm waiting for the DVD, but for the low price how can  you go wrong.",952819200,,383,3.948051948051948
