6775893,3,B00OY7YPRE,"3 1/2 STARS -- SLOW BURN, BACK WOODS KIND OF TALE CENTERED ON A CIVIL WAR MASSACRE AND MODERN REDEMPTION OF A SORT

INTRO: Based on an acclaimed novel by Ron Rash, this slowly paced film is not designed so much to entertain as it is to convey a feeling and certain concepts.  It employs the Civil War story of the real life Shelton Laurel Massacre in North Carolina (an event also featured in the movie Cold Mountain).  In this fictional story ""World Made Straight"", the community still bears the scars of division over 100 years later and there is also pervasive sense of economic immobility that sets up the premise of the film.  Time doesn't always heal and history can present itself again in interesting ways.  Sometimes tragedy can act as a force of creative destruction, making springboards to a better life.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Travis Shelton (Jeremy Irvine, War Horse) is a high school drop out headed down the wrong path.  He has lost his job at a local store, and is out fishing and wandering in the woods when he comes across a neighbor's marijuana grove.  He steals a plant and takes it to another minor dealer named Leonard (Noah Wyle, Falling Skies) introduced to him by a friend.  Leonard sells a little pot now and then, but is a former school teacher who lost his job and family after a false accusation by a disgruntled student.  Leonard lives in a trailer with his girlfriend Dena (Minka Kelly, Friday Night Lights) who is a drug addict on her own self destructive path.  Fate plays a significant hand with the two outcasts, Travis and Leonard, and the teacher soon becomes a mentor and father figure to Travis (who is having troubles with his own family as well).  As Travis renews his studies with the teacher, conflict arises with the local drug dealers when he tries to steal another plant.  They also take an interest in Dena as the plot thickens.  These events will draw the mild mannered Leonard into yet more problems he didn't create.  All through the movie, Leonard reads excerpts from an ancestor's journal that are mundane doctor's entries, yet ultimately reveal secrets of the massacre and a guilt that doesn't seem to heal, even through generations.  This bleakish emotional tale does have some rays of light for the viewer, one of which is a beautiful and kind hospital worker (Adelaide Clemens) whom Travis comes to love.  (I saw Adelaide in a British series Parade's End a few years ago and she is one of my favorite young actresses).  In the end though, there is a world that needs to be made straight. There is more than one reckoning to be made.

FINAL THOUGHTS: The movie deftly conveys the slow country feeling and concepts of divided community, time not passing.  Despite the modest budget, I would even say the production values are quite good.  There may be a few scenes where the acting is only slightly uneven, but overall the performances from each actor are excellent and there are some interesting characters.  I like well crafted stories that can also convey a feeling.  However, this one slows too far and the mostly necessary narrations and pacing have the secondary effect of nearly stalling the movie with dryness.  It's realistic, it's necessary to construct the premise, but it still has that secondary effect.  That pacing is actually part of the atmospheric construction of a 70's Appalachian town, and completely appropriate in a way.  Many people looking strictly for entertainment might not enjoy this movie.  However, if you find something in this description that sparks an interest, or if you are a fan of the novel, you should at least give it a rent to see if it works for you.",1421452800,8,3650,4.714511041009464
6775894,3,B00OY7YPRE,"This is another slow moving rural south character study. To its credit, this film doesn't have any incest, necrophilia, or meth heads. The opening scene takes place in 1863 as 12 year old David Shelton is being shot by Confederate soldiers for the crime of ""Unionism."" Southerners killing southerners.  The film quickly shifts to modern times to the life of Travis, high school drop out, who lives in a near-by county. He just got fired from his job and doesn't get along with his dad. He befriends Leonard (Noah Wyle) who is a small time drug dealer and a fallen teacher. Dena (Minka Kelly) is his live in girlfriend who likes Leonard's drugs, a woman who has yet to learn to care for herself. Leonard takes Travis in and attempts to help the young man out to get his GED and to explore the past. To Travis, events that happened 150 years ago, sometimes outweigh what is happening today.

The film moves along with a lot of dialogue. There is a pair of pot growers that act as the protagonist when dad isn't around. This is another film that seemed like they didn't know how to end it. The acting was good. If you enjoy films such as ""Winterbone"" without Jennifer Lawrence, this one will fit into the groove.

6775905,3,B00OY7YPRE,"I have read five Ron Rash books including The World Made Straight and I thought this was a much better than average film adaptation.  I loved the book Serena but did not care for the movie.  This movie was well filmed (in and around Marshall, NC), had good acting, music and I thought it was a good story that kept pretty close to the book.  It's a version of the Hatfields and the McCoys (Shelton v the Candlers) but part of the story is the foolishness of holding grudges dating to the Civil War.  Mostly, it's a story about redemption.  It's well worth a look and Steve Earle plays a role and even sings a little.  He did a good job considering he was supposed to be a much larger man.",1455408000,,688,4.213740458015267

6775907,4,B00OY7YPRE,"The World Made Straight is a crawl through history.  It is a story of a man trying to make amends got the errors of his kin.  Set in Appalachia (filmed in the mountains of NC), Noah Wyle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Librarian-Trilogy/dp/B00BUELRXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Librarian Trilogy</a>) plays a small time drug dealing man, Leonard, who eventually takes in an aimless high school dropout, Travis (Jeremy Irvine).  Travis meets Leonard through Shank (Haley Joel Osment,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B004NAEH5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>) when they go to buy drugs. After Travis quits his job his father (Alex Van) throws him out of the house.  Travis takes refuge with Leonard.

Travis finds a journal written by a Civil War doctor who also happens to be a distant relative.  While thumbing through the journal Travis becomes more and more intrigued with the contents of the journal.

Through his stupidity Travis becomes involved with more major dealers in Carleton (Steve Earle&nbsp;]) and Hubert (Marcus Hester), a man you just know is itching for a fight.

It may seem too slow for some.  Parts of the movie may feel unnecessary to others.  However, for those who stick with it, this movie offers an interesting story, some important history and enjoyable acting.",1452124800,2,1412,6.015
6775908,4,B00OY7YPRE,The acting was superb and the plot had several unexpected twists. I haven't seen Noah Wyle in any movies in quite some time and was glad to see him acting once again. I thought Jeremy Irvine's acting was awesome! as well.  It would have been nice to have confirmed that he and the girl were together at the last although I don't think he left town with her. Excerpts from the civil war doctor's old  journal being intertwined throughout the story line was a nice touch. Just enough of the journal was read without being overdone. The idea of civil war mistrust among families of this region  a century ago carrying down to ancestors of the present was a novel idea: I liked how it was woven into the story.,1451260800,,706,4.415384615384616
6775909,5,B00OY7YPRE,"I was skeptical about Noah Wylie playing a western North Carolina mountain man, but did respectably well. This movie is based on probably my favorite Ron Rash novel to this point. The movie appears to be filmed exclusively or almost exclusively in Madison County, NC, which is familiar so that makes it even more enjoyable to watch the movie. I thought Dena's character was not as rough-looking as she realistically would most likely be, so that was a bit of a weakness (A bit closer to Dale Dickey in ""Winter's Bone"" but younger would have been more fitting in my opinion). Watched it the first time on the computer, the second time on the TV screen; a larger screen is beneficial to the cinematography.",1444780800,,704,4.685483870967742

6775959,5,B00OY7YPRE,"Ron Rash is a true master at weaving the fabric of history (the Shelton Laurel Massacre of 1863) with rich Appalachian fiction. Though Leonard, Travis, and the Toomeys are fictitious characters, their personalities are universal and stay with you. Amazingly, this film perfectly captured Rash's book. After watching the travesty of a movie based on his incredibly harrowing novel ""Serena,"" I wasn't entering this film was high hopes. Perhaps it's because these characters are so well developed by Rash that they easily jump onto the silver screen, or perhaps this time the actors knew what was needed and didn't try to fake their way through the film, or perhaps it's nothing more than this story being set in the Appalachians and their charm permeates the stories. Whatever it is, ""A World Made Straight"" is truly wonderful. Knowing about the characters in Rash's novel (I highly recommend it - absolutely wonderful without trying to make as much of a statement as ""Serena"" did and without overplaying his hand with ""Saints at the River"") makes these movie versions more tangible, but so much of the spirit from his book is present that you can watch it without journeying into a timeless North Carolina Appalachian town in print. Using Leonard as the narrator for the Doctor's journal was excellent and how I had imagined it, and I really enjoy the ending. That was something I thought a movie would try to tidy up instead of letting it flow; by leaving the ending as Rash wrote it, the viewer can decide on what happens to his/her versions of the characters. If you enjoy Southern noire or are enticed by the repetitions of history that overplay our everyday lives, you will enjoy this movie. As I said, the book is also fantastic and I highly recommend it.",1429142400,2,1760,4.83112582781457
