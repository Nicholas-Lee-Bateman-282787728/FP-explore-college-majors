7359045,5,B012X1YCL6,"One the strangest movies I have ever seen...and loads of fun. Everything from, as the title suggest, gangster Yakuza, to world destroying giant frogs and people farms. Highly recomended",1444435200,4,185,5.413793103448276
7359046,2,B012X1YCL6,"Repetitive, and very stupid during the second half.  Ran out of ideas, did Miike.  The film started to feel like a yakuza version of ""They Live."" (Not that that is bad, it is just that endless fighting - for half an hour - and not very interesting fighting - is not hitting me right at this time.)",1494892800,,297,4.192982456140351

7359059,2,B012X1YCL6,"I so, SO wanted this movie to be good. I love the style and wackiness of films like this, but this one was just a mess. I turned it off about 3/5ths of the way in. Terrible pacing, badly told story, too many characters that don't contribute, etc. Its too bad because the trailer was five levels of awesome. Just skip it.",1472083200,,320,4.17741935483871

The only thing that was missing was an English over-dub. Normally subtitles are no big deal, but when you have to constantly shift your attention back and forth to keep up with the story you miss some of the insanity on screen.

7359071,5,B012X1YCL6,"Even though this was about a vampire, it was more yakuza related.  I learned more about what it is to be a yakuza than a vamp.  So watch this movie if you wanna see a good yakuza rather than Twilight flick.",1463788800,,206,4.0

7359074,5,B012X1YCL6,"F. Scott Fitzgerald famously once said that genius was the ability to hold two opposite views and still function. If he is right, this new film of Takashi Miike, Yakuza Apocalypse, is a work of pure genius.

The remarkable aspect of Yakuza Apocalypse is not the plot  there really is no plot  nor the characters  they are at best cartoonish. It is the ability of Miike to throw into the movie an array of movie cliches and images and still make the movie work.

This is not the first time Miike has directed a movie of this sort. A notable example is Sukiyaki Spaghetti Django. That movie had noticeable elements of a Spaghetti Western, a la Sergio Leoni, placed in a Yakuza conflict, as a musical of sorts, with images of a conventional John Ford Western.

Here, in Yakuza Apocalypse, that Yakuza-based rivalry continues. Instead of guns and knives, the Yakuza rivals battle it out with traditional martial arts. In addition, thrown into the mix are elements of Vampires, Zombies, Godzilla, Night of the Living Dead, traditional Japanese folk tale characters, and as a crowning finish, a Harpie dressed as Dracula.

The gang of the one Yazuka rival can only be described as demented. They are not depicted as morally deprived animals, as in other Yakuza movies, but as just plain weird people. One gang member, for example, while they are holding a group meeting can be seen knitting a doily. For the life of me, I swear Miike took that character from one of the main players in American Horror Story, Third Season, but I cant be sure.

Miike to be sure has produced other fine mainstream films. His re-make of Hari-Kiri and Shield of Straw come to mind.

If you're looking for plot, or character, or over-all message in this film you will be sorely disappointed and utterly frustrated.

The best way to enjoy this film is to sit back and see how many movie cliches you can find in this movie. It is a veritable kaleidoscope, and is an enjoyable movie experience.",1461715200,,1964,4.666666666666667

7359085,4,B012X1YCL6,I just got done watching it was weird like most of Miike movies are and if you want something weird and just a good time than I highly recommend this title to you it's a mix bag of sorts of unexplained plot and yet I was okay with that even with the ending just cutting off like that but if you want a popcorn film and just dive into a movie than go for this one,1458777600,,362,3.776315789473684

7359103,4,B012X1YCL6,"This film really cracked me up and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I see a lot of negative reviews in which the writers obviously didn't understand the aim of Miike when he made this movie.  For one, if you are not familiar with the Yakuza genre a good chunk of this movie will go right over your head, esspecially the humor.  It seems to me that this movie is a comedy before anything else, so if you don't understand the Yakuza related humor you will be missing a lot.  On top of that Miike is a completely off the wall bizarro director, so if you are expecting a traditional straight up action movie you will be dissapointed. That being said, if you enjoy the madness of Takashi Miike and have knowledge of traditional Yakuza film you will probably find Yakuza Apocalypse entertaining.",1457136000,,782,4.524822695035461

7359108,1,B012X1YCL6,I wasn't expecting much of a plot but the previews made this seem completely over the top.

What could have redeemed it was if the fight scenes were actually good.,1456876800,,340,4.467741935483871

I like the fact that it had like an asian mafia in it with a twist and the characters were all very unique, and comfortable with their roles. It took place in a small town called Yakuza. The town was a slum and not like the atypical movie, felt like the old western flicks as everything was just kind of worn and used looking without being a B movie. The actors were spot on with their lines and I liked the kick boxing martial arts rather than the over done anti-gravity martial arts that are so outlandish you love it anyway. But these martial artists were for real with no special effects. If you like movies with Asian Mafia in a small worn down town, a weird guy with an electric bolt shooting gun, a gecko that can do a beat down, a cast of characters that mostly turn into vampires, a big weird semi truck that has twin rotating machine guns and colored blinking lites, and a long asian movie with a western flavor, then this is your movie.

It is a great film to sit around with friends or even alone and watch for a good laugh. It has everything from hilarious wardrobe changes, to kung fu frogs. I personally spent the majority of the movie with a smile on my face from laughing so much. I feel like the average review is so low because people watch it expecting a high budget Michael Bay style movie with kung fu and explosions and while it has both the delivery is for a less serious and more comedic approach. Its not too cheesy that it makes you feel awkward for watching it, and it treads a fine line between action and relief comedy.

So that brings me to the main point of this review. If you are looking for a great cheesy movie to sit down with and have a good laugh with your friends, or just enjoy the format itself, you will definitely enjoy this movie. If you are here for a rather serious type movie where you hang on to every word, and expect larger than life heroes and heroines, i do not think this movie would be for you.

All said and done I will and have been recommending this movie to friends and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh and enjoyable movie.",1453593600,4,1395,4.316793893129771

7359251,2,B012X1YCL6,"As of this writing, Takashi Miike has 99 directing credits on IMDB.  Of those 99, I challenge you to find a film stranger than Yakuza Apocalypse.  Yes, hes directed sadistically gory pictures like Ichi the Killer, goofy films like Zebraman, and prestige pics like his 3-D remake of Hara-Kiri.  He definitely has a broad range, but hes never mashed all these genres up into a single picture until now.

The story starts out simply enough.  A Yakuza oyabun (boss), who just happens to be a vampire, is beheaded by a nerdy guy with a backpack and his friend who looks like Vampire Hunter D.  One of the bosss underlings, Kageyama, is bitten by the head before it dies, thereby becoming a vampire and the gangs new oyabun.  Thats where things start to get really weird.  I won't give away too much, but I will tell you that the climactic battle features a supernatural creature in a theme park character costume that looks a lot like HR Pufnstuff.  No, I am not making this up.

Let me start by saying that I was genuinely excited to see this film.  While I haven't enjoyed every movie that Miike has made, I do appreciate the fact that he often tries new things.  If you do that enough, youll fail part of the time.  For me, Yakuza Apocalypse is one of those failures.  Not only did I dislike it; I found it boring, and thats a word I never thought Id use in association with Miikes work.

The story has no drive.  Kageyama is shown to be a loyal and ambitious underling whos picked on by the other Yakuza.  You might imagine a revenge scenario, and that does sort of play out briefly, but then we move on.  The picture has no backbone.  Its just a random sequence of odd events punctuated by appearances of the Vampire Hunter D weirdoa guy in an Elizabethan ruff who speaks incomprehensible English sans subtitles.  Were never allowed to get close enough to Kageyama to root for himor against him.  I just didn't care what happened next.

My conclusion is that this is all played for comedy and I just didn't get it.  I rarely find Japanese comedies to be funny, so it would follow that the comedic elements of this one wouldnt land with me.  Perhaps this is Miikes Evil Dead 2.

As to the design and execution of the movie, all of the elements are top-notch.  Miike clearly knows how to make a movie look and sound great, even when using a crew of relative newcomers.  Of particular interest to me, was the films portrayal of a kappaa vampiric creature from Japanese folklore.

While I cant recommend this feature, I do applaud Miike for trying new things.  He continues to push the margins so far that he sometimes falls right off the edge of the paper.  Thats what it means to be an artist.  The Hollywood machine certainly needs more directors like Miike behind the camera.  Instead, the big studios are trying to take away directorial clout by relying on marquee franchises in place of inspired talent.  But thats a post for another day.",1451174400,,2940,4.507575757575758

7359253,4,B012X1YCL6,"Takashi Miike's latest gorefest comedy, Yakuza Apocalypse, is as insane and entertaining as Gozu. It's a mashup of violent bloody gang fights, eye popping martial arts, vampires, and fantasy with several shout-out to other movies from Yojimbo and the original Django with the coffin, to Revenge Of The Nerds, to ET or maybe Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, to The Island Of Dr. Moreau with a half-man half-turtle character, to Eddie Romero's bat-man character in Twilight People (the hero vampire's costume and the ending remind me of TP's ending). The weirdest but fun part is the giant Kero Kero Keroppi frog lookalike and its bulging eyes death stare. I enjoyed the movie in all its craziness. Only Takashi Miike can pull off this kind of extremely weird movie.",1449878400,,767,4.953488372093023
7359254,2,B012X1YCL6,"The Yakuza part is a lot easier to understand than the Apocalypse part. Kamiura (Lily Frankie) is the Yakuza for a small town, acting as a benevolent godfather. He used to be part of a larger syndicate. He is also a vampire. The syndicate comes after him with a Japanese version of Van Helsing and succeed in killing him, but he is able to pass on his vampire powers to Kagayama (Hayato Ichihara) a compassionate understudy. Kagayama doesn't know how to control himself and starts a chain reaction where everyone in the town gets bit. The people in the town decide they are all Yakuza and don't need to pay protection money to the real Yakuza. There is a theme that develops that the Yakuza are the real blood suckers who need to feed off of civilians to survive. There was a goblin in the film that used an ET finger touch while they played a riff from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Go Figure.

Now I was okay up with the film at this point and then we entered the head scratch phase where Japan's idea of a plague of frogs is different than the acceptable western thought. This was apparently the ""apocalypse"" aspect of the film which was silly. Now I would not have minded the silly ending if the film had started out that way.

7359255,3,B012X1YCL6,"""What the !$?& did I just watch?! was my immediate response when the throng of Yakuza Apocalypse's closing credits began to roll. To be fair, that's a common response when dealing with the batshit films of prolific director, Takashi Miike, who has probably completed two or three films in the time taken to write this review. With his incredible output the general quality of his movies is hit-or-miss, but he's best the less he's restricted by the bounds of logic and good sense. Yakuza Apocalypse may not be Miike's best film, and lord knows he'll try to top it ten times over, but it's the only one to feature a kung-fu frog monster destroyer of worlds.

No really, there's a kung-fu frog monster destroyer of worlds at the center of Yakuza Apocalypse, but...well...it's also wearing a plush costume. Why? Probably best not to ask because clearly Miike and screenwriter Yoshitaka Yamaguchi's were in some kind of drug-induced mania when coming up with this one. The result is like being detached from reality and sent to that same genre nether-region where a film like R100 exists; if any of it makes sense to you then perhaps a rubber room and straight jacket are in your future.

The plot is absurd in the best kind of way. There's a Yakuza boss (Rir Furank) who just can't seem to be killed. We know this from the scores of bullets he takes before chopping down his foes. He's loved by his men and seen as a Robin Hood-type by the townspeople. He lives by a strict moral code, refusing to use guns or harm any civilians. His closest confidante is young Kageyama (Hayato Ichihara), who is a wimp compared to the other gangsters. As close as they are, Kageyama doesn't know the boss' secret that he's actually a long-lived vampire, and one of the few ways to kill him is decapitation. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happens when a foe dressed like an Old West priest, and TheRaid's Yayan Ruhian, dressed as a dorky tourist no less; jump him in a back alley. After the boss gets his head twisted off his shoulders like a bottle cap, he still has enough to bite Kageyama and turn him into a vampire, too. Super incredible Yakuza vampire strength GO!!!

It's up to Kageyama to get revenge, but first he has to get control of the blood thirst...which never really happens. He starts biting the crap out of everybody, turning them into his own personal yakuza vampire army. But wait...there's also some monstrous invincible creature looming that everyone is terrified of. How'd he learn about it? Well, y'see there's this underground sewing in a noodle shop run by a guy who has a fetish for stomping on feet and...this is actually the tamest thing about Yakuza Apocalypse.

Perhaps that's the biggest problem facing the film as there is simply too much absurdity crowded into a limited space. Granted, at over two hours long there's nothing limited about the run time, but the crazy amounts of bloodshed and goofball antics leave little room for anything else. We only get a few moments of Kageyama coping with his transformation, although the brief scene we get is powerful. Miike briefly touches on the blood-sucking nature of the Yakuza and organized crime in general, and one of the more insane subplots involves the actual growing of human beings just to have people to extort.  This effort is led by the new Yakuza boss who, for some inexplicable reason, has some strange white fluid in her ear like water from the beach.

There's just too much chaos to go around, and enjoyment will depend on how willing you are to embrace it. While there are plenty of big laughs, blood, and gunplay to go around, the film's well-choreographed hand-to-hand brawls are stellar. And yes, this includes the showdown with the aforementioned kung-fu frog monster destroyer of worlds who is like an amphibian Bruce Lee. And of course, any time you have Yayan Ruhian kicking ass its worth checking out. That guy is phenomenal, even when dressed like a total spaz.  Yakuza Apocalypse doesn't make a lick of sense, but if you're willing to get detached from reality for a while this is a different way to do it.",1448323200,3,4098,4.723076923076923

7359261,4,B012X1YCL6,"First, this is from Takashi Miike, so if you like his films, you know what you're getting into. He's quite prolific, but his trademark quirks, humor and exceptional violence are present. I watched this specifically because it was a Miike film, which is probably why others have rated it lower, because they had other expectations. Inevitably, I would say this is a great film if you're looking for some campy Miike that includes; nontraditional, interestingly presented characters, good, but sporadic, choreographed action and solid B-movie story-line with campy humor.

Second, the plot... since there is basically none mentioned under Amazon's direct video and under DVD it's a bit confusing. The movie is basically good-guy Yakuza boss transfers his vampire powers to another good-guy Yakuza underling. He has a crush, so there's a random love interest side thing too if that bothers you. The Yakuza splinter, so there's the vampire Yakuza and human Yakuza, they're at odds with each other. Then, there's this whole underworld of random creatures and characters that sort of gang up on the vampire Yakuza as well. So, essentially it turns into a cluster of various groups seeking vengeance, world domination, whatever and they all fight. It's not deep, it's just random Miike fun if you're in the mood.

Finally, if you're looking for nonstop martial arts action, this probably isn't going to be your type of movie. It takes a bit of time to build and there are certainly pauses between the various fight scenes. Also, the film doesn't take itself seriously, so some of the action sequences are punctuated with campy antics and humor, which I assume might be offsetting for some. Basically, if you like your cinema campy with blood and violence and laughs and odd creatures, then you'll have a good time.",1446768000,14,1807,5.040133779264214

Kageyama, the yakuza sub turned new Yakuza Vampire Boss (capitalized so you know it's important), starts biting people and it doesn't make them vampires, it makes them yakuza. So, shortly the whole town is yakuza. That's when the Frog comes, Kaeru-kun. Yes, you heard that right.

8726694,3,B012X1YCL6,"Takashi Miike returns to make movies that he used to make back in the 90s but with a bigger budget and better actors. It's an interesting situation. He started getting serious  critical acclaim and multiple films shown at Cannes. While all this was going on, Sion Sono suddenly realized he could make his movies fun instead of morose like Suicide Circle. They basically came out as more hyper active versions of early Miike films that despite having tons of gross content also didn't feel nearly as gross as early Miike films. Yakuza Apocalypse feels like Miike's attempt to tell off Sono and let him know he still owns this kind of absurdist style film.

It's not entirely successful. It's close. I can't say that it's terrible. I also can't say it's all that great. He has a lot of the typical Miike elements but in a lot of ways it feels like he's keeping the kid gloves on. Time spent getting accolades has killed some of his slimier impulses unlike Sono who plays like high brow Ryan Murphy TV at times,  which it's Ryan Murphy without the racism and snobbery too. The problem is that because of that the movie feels pretty sedate until the end with the kung fu frog. The Kappa, a duck and turtle hybrid monster, man is there but he's kind of whatever. It doesn't help either that the movie isn't that far removed from the TV show The Strain. He doesn't even have the same sense of the perverse as that show does with it's vampire sexual intercourse feeding imagery. You got some gore too but it's again oddly toothless.

It's not a terrible movie like I said. The end is pretty great too with the frog and all. It's just not gonna hit the nausea  or repulsion nerves the way Miike used too. It's probably a good thing as he went way too far. At the same time it's an interesting situation to see a guy realize that his genre may have passed him by",1506470400,,1853,4.422287390029325
