7973596,5,B0000714A3,"This was an EXCELLENT purchase - I got a chance to see different African Filmakers from all walks of life bring stories to the big screen and it was wonderful. This is definitely the Aesop's fables of Africa, with each story having a lesson, and I recommend it to EVERYONE who likes a great independent film!",1175558400,4,308,4.517857142857143
7973597,4,B0000714A3,"This film consists of three African shorts by three female directors. They've chosen Queen Latifah to introduce each of the films. These are films that will intrigue your teenager and put to question for adults, how can we help our youth make better decisions? This film is an excellet film that can used in schools, community clubs, and church orgranizations to bring about discussion of topics that might seem racy but real! Life-like teen issues for all to sift through for understanding and clarity to see hhow some of their choices might play out. Gritty and real. Loved it. This movie gets 4 stars because some of the cinematography is weak but other than that -- super films.",1154995200,4,682,4.788135593220339

My professor recommended this DVD. I took a summer class and we had to watch Mama Africa and write a short paper on the movie.",1135641600,5,208,3.8372093023255816
7973599,4,B0000714A3,"I really enjoyed this DVD, which I rented from my neighborhood video store.  It's always interesting to see Africa depicted beyond the stereotypical huts and safaris, and compelling to watch Africans weave their own stories of challenges and triumphs on the modern day continent.  Also included are three shorts, my favorite of which, ""Bintou,"" is a simple tale of a clashing wife and husband in Burkina Faso. Check it out!",1042416000,23,423,5.0285714285714285
