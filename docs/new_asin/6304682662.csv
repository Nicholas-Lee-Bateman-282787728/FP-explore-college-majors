7875379,1,6304682662,"I found this video difficult to understand. It is done almost entirely in interview format with two practitioners who have heavy German accents. Added to the poor sound quality of the film, it was frustrating. The sound modulation was very poor. I had to keep adjusting the volume up and down, which was annoying and distracting.
The content was pretty basic. Anyone who knows enough about the subject to want to purchase the video probably already knows as much as is presented here. I doubt that you will learn much that is new to you. The video touches very briefly and superficially on breathing techniques and hyperbaric oxygen chambers and then goes on to spend most of its time discussing hydrogen peroxide. It talks about the various grades and how they can be used. It touches briefly on ozone therapy.
The style is annoying, with an off-screen interviewer who is never seen, asking questions that can't be heard, that are answered by the interviewees, one of which doesn't seem to have much to share. In fact I had to ask myself why anyone bothered to include those clips in the video. I also asked myself just who the target audience was supposed to be. Anyone interested in the subject enough to spend $24.95 plus S&H probably already knows more about the subject than you are going to learn here. Personally I would rather have my money back.",981072000,6,1355,4.7215189873417724
