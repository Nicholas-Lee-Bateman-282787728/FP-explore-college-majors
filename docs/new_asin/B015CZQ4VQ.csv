8733207,1,B015CZQ4VQ,"Ms. Snow may be great but to pay over $250 for all her ""lessons"" is ridiculous. Is she trying to help others, or make herself a bundle? Given the lack of sales, what's the point? If the series cost too much, as these do, they help no one because few will purchase such expensive books/DVDs, etc.  I'm not buy in - top spendy. The Alz Asso has great info, too ... free!",1498867200,2,368,4.111111111111111

8733209,5,B015CZQ4VQ,Teepa Snow is the best...great ideas and approaches to handling a loved one with dementia.  Some suggested approaches although effective are not practical due to a caregiver's time constraints.,1478476800,,193,5.655172413793103
