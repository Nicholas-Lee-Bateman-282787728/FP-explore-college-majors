Gen. 1

[1] In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
[2] And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
[3] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
[4] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
[5] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
[6] And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
[7] And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
[8] And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
[9] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
[10] And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
[11] And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
[12] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[13] And the evening and the morning were the third day.
[14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
[15] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
[16] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
[17] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
[18] And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
[19] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
[20] And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
[21] And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[22] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
[23] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
[24] And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
[25] And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[26] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
[27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
[28] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
[29] And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
[30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
[31] And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
Gen. 2

[1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
[2] And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
[3] And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.",1460160000,3,4604,4.096345514950166

7365265,5,B013HOZKQE,I found this DVD to be very interesting and I liked that it educates about Earth's geology and also the other planets in our solar system. It also shows how different and unique our planet is. I like that it follows a sequence of events (both geologic and cosmic) that happened long ago and goes all the way into modern times. It is filmed in 14 different countries. The footage and coverage in the geologic spots on the select (7) continents is amazing and I found this intriguing and it scores high on education value. I give this one 5 stars for its educational value and recommend it for ages 8-18.,1445385600,6,602,4.4324324324324325
7365286,3,B013HOZKQE,Even though the video covers prehistoric climate change.  The creators had to say modern climate change is caused by man.  Other wise information was good.,1519862400,2,155,5.16

Earth, the only planet orbiting the Sun that has continents, oceans, plate tectonics [crustal slabs that slowly move], and the sole planet with an atmosphere that has sustained life for billions of years.  How did Earth get this way?

Whats behind the power, the violence, that cracks solid rock in an instant, that shatters buildings, and sends tsunamis [tidal waves] racing for the shore, that erupts seas of lava and billows clouds of ash? ...

Scientists have new answers to questions about our home

Its a story that just a few decades ago, could not have been told.

The above comes from the beginning of this informative and fascinating documentary that traces the geologic story of our home planet beginning with the Big Bang and continuing with its evolution to the present.

There are many questions answered in this film but here are the three key ones important to me that were answered:

(1) What makes Earths plates or crustal slabs move?
(2) Where did all of Earths liquid water come from?
(3) Is Earth in a period of intense geologic upheaval?

I also found the segment entitled Climate through geologic time and the comparisons made to our planetary neighbours, Venus (our sister planet) & Mars, quite interesting.

Besides the excellent narration, there are brief comments from others throughout (NASA geologists, scientists, professors, etc.).  The cinematography is astounding and the graphics aid greatly in understanding whats being said as does the archival footage thats used.

Finally, here are the geologic hotspots on all seven continents where this movie was filmed:

(1) Antarctica (2) Bangladesh (3) China (4) Japan (5) Ecuador (6) Greece (7) Guatemala (8) India (9) Italy (10) Kenya (11) Mexico (12) Mongolia (13) Nepal (14) Pakistan (15) U.S.

Funding for this film was provided by the U.S. Dept. of Energy and the National Science Foundation.

In conclusion, by the end of this documentary you should know definitively how our unique planet works!!

However, it really sidesteps all the current Earth events happening, like 40 volcanoes are erupting (April 2016) whereas there are only 25 on average for a whole year prior to this.  They're sidestepping sink holes, land tears, Earth trumpets and host of other disturbing trends well discussed on YouTube with stunning videos.  They're say this is all natural variability and the dramatic increase in Earthquakes over the last few years (of all magnitudes) is because of increased reporting.

7365583,4,B013HOZKQE,"A most relevant documentary, given the recent earthquakes that have plagued Japan and Ecuador.  The program does a very good job of explaining plate tectonics, particularly the physics of subduction.  For geology aficianados,  it's worth a look.",1461024000,5,245,5.5675675675675675
7365584,4,B013HOZKQE,Information about our planet.  Exciting that we now understand so much.  Amazing that it is only in very recent times that much of this has been discovered.  We are very lucky to be living now!,1460851200,,193,4.457142857142857
7365585,5,B013HOZKQE,Thank you for a substantial and yet succinct geology primer. A great way to get the information for the first time.

8727750,2,B013HOZKQE,"Worst quality PBS doc I've ever seen and doesn't seem like one at all.  Has a computer sounding narrator.  They also present the molten early Earth theory, which was pretty effectively countered with new moon rock analysis in 2008 or so, and this doc is from 2014, so not the most current.  Otherwise it is short and just ok, but how to know how current anything is?",1534032000,,366,4.432835820895522
8727751,4,B013HOZKQE,"This is a simple, well produced, understandable narrative of the complete history of our planet.  Most of this we should have all heard in school, but this has been updated with current scientific understanding and theories.  This focuses on the interaction of plate tectonics and atmosphere.  This slips by all current politics and states only what science currently observes.

Pro: Comprehensive and current.
Con:  High-school level information.",1533945600,,447,5.611940298507463
