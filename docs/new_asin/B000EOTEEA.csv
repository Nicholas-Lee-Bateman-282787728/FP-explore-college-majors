8112139,4,B000EOTEEA,"This was of interest to me as I was stationed on one of the lighthouses (Tree Point) when I was in the Coast Guard.  However, it saddened me to see what a deteriorated state it is in, as we worked so hard to keep it ""ship shape.""  But the history behind each of these facilities is very interesting and , I think, most people would enjoy that aspect.",1428451200,,350,4.132352941176471
8112140,4,B000EOTEEA,"I am a fan of lighthouse videos, and I have been been for several years.  I like this one because of how it covers the history and present status of lighthouses in places I never will be able to visit.  I plan to watch it periodically, in part, because I find it relaxing to watch videos that have anything to do with the oceans.  I recommend it.",1420848000,,346,4.134328358208955
8112141,5,B000EOTEEA,"If you have seen volume 1, then you know what you are getting.  Volume 2 is just as good.  Only bad thing I can think of to say about it is it's not presented in true widescreen.  If you are viewing it on a widescreen tv there are black bars at the top, bottom, left and right - if you have a tv or dvd player with a zoom function you can use that but you'll lose some image quality.  Otherwise this is a great set, PBS really knocked the ball out of the park - as far as lighthouse documentaries go, I've seen none better.  I only hope they consider re-releasing these in hi-def anamorphic widescreen soon.",1387411200,2,607,4.110169491525424
