I don't think I have enjoyed a film like I did this one in a long time! For the rest of the day I couldn't stop thinking about this movie! I had to own it! It has a very original killer with a very original backstory, and fully developed characters. If you love slasher films, there are some HIGHLY inventive kills! There's a certain one that comes to mind every time I have to pop a squat! There's also a lot of humor. The majority of it comes from veteran scream queen Debbie Rochon. Her character will have you in stitches! I had the pleasure of meeting a lot of the cast members as well as the director himself and they are all amazing people. So please support them all by watching this film! Also check out the first movie- Crinoline Head. You will not be disappointed.",1442880000,2,901,4.337278106508876

Starring: Jason Vail, Christian James, Kirsten Ray, Gunner Willis, Leah Wiseman, Elizabeth Mears, Nicholas A Sweezer, Debbie Rochon, John Kap

SPEEDY SYNOPSIS: Ill try not to spoil too much here, but read on at your own risk, also as this is a sequel, spoilers RE: Crinoline Head are kind of essential. Sorry!

Set 20 years on from the events of Crinoline Head, survivor Paul (Vail) is now a college teacher, albeit one whose life has fallen apart due to his obsession with serial killer and doll fan, Dorchester Stewart. It seems that following the harrowing events of the first film, Paul was unable to move on, researching Dorchester for a book that saw him neglect and lose his wife. Now, finally, he is finally set to lay his demons to rest... until a class project sees his deepest fears laid bare.
After asking his students to write an essay on local legends, the frankly bastardly insensitive David (James) and his dorkish friend James (Willis) announce to the class that they are writing theirs on Crinoline Head. Paul isn't happy, kindly explains the events of the first film to the class (and anybody who hasn't seen the first film) but ultimately gives them permission to head to Stewart's abandoned lakefront home to research the story.
So off they go (rocking out to some metal along the way), joined by the very sweet Shelby (Ray) and Donna (Wiseman).
Upon arrival they are surprised to see that much of the original building has burned down... but not as surprised as they are to discover hard-drinking, filthy mouthed Betsy (horror veteran Rochon) living in a mobile home on the site, brandishing a shotgun and spitting a steady stream of sexual innuendos.
Finally the group are joined by loveably lunk Scott (Sweezer), buddy Reggie (Turner) and the fabulously vindictive, slutty Janet (a very impressive Mears), who, well, pretty much turn up because they've not got much better to do and think this is as good a place as any to run amok as hormone-fuelled teens tend to do.
However, it isn't long before we realise that this idyllic location may not be fun, fun, fun as a spate of steadily more gruesome murders causes the cast's numbers to dwindle at an alarming rate. David was determined to prove that Dorchester was still out there... and now it could be the death of them all.

BEST BITS (mild spoiler warning): The first film was good fun, in a low-budget, throwback way - yet this film completely surpasses it on nearly every level. The production values are frankly superb, the unfeasibly attractive cast are all perfect in their roles (I particularly enjoyed the hilarious Scott and Janet, but everybody was brilliant) and the story and camerawork were absolutely top drawer.
As if that wasn't enough, this film is so well-written that you really needn't be familiar with Crinoline Head to just dive straight in and enjoy the events of this picture, no mean feat in a film that so perfectly works as a sequel too.
With this film Tommy Faircloth has got the balance EXACTLY right - the film is packed with plenty of references for fans of the original and really does feel like a natural extension of that story, yet still remains accessible to newcomers.
The film retains the campy, tongue-in-cheek charm of the original, but updated and polished for today's audiences.
Furthermore, the humour throughout is legitimately VERY funny, from Debbie Rochon's crude explanations of her innuendos to Janet's acidic putdowns, the film made me laugh several times. There's even a brief detour midway through the film in which three catty drag queens on their way to a gig at a local bar end up wandering into the killer's path. It contributes NOTHING whatsoever to the ongoing plot of the film, but it is so much fun it really doesn't need to.
Speaking of the killer, his hulking design works on so many levels. After seeing musclebound potential victims in Scott and David, I felt the killer would have his work cut out - but Crinoline Head is a great bear of a man and looks more than capable of beating the living hell out of anybody that gets in his way, while the cracked doll-face mask that he sports (much like Billy Pon's equally terrifying Doll Boy) is the stuff of nightmares.
This delightfully creepy design work carries over into a couple of sets (in particular THAT doll-filled lair) while the edgy nature of the film definitely carries over into a couple of the kill scenes. One is guaranteed to make any girls watching shriek, while the heartbreaking pinata scene is another memorably horrifying moment.

WORST BITS (mild spoiler warning): I really can find very little to fault with this film, so don't expect this section to be too long!
While this film definitely improved on the pacing issues of the first film, it still seemed to take a while to get to the bloody end of the story. Frankly, I didn't mind because I really enjoyed getting to know the characters and building some sympathy towards our victims before the hammer fell, but if you're into wall-to-wall splatter for a film's run-time, this one requires a little more patience.
On a similar note, a few of the deaths do occur off-screen. I'm not sure whether this was due to budget constraints or to help build atmosphere for when the red stuff really hits the fan later, but either way, it may cause gorehounds to moan a little. However, I thought the kills pretty much all worked wonderfully without over-egging the gore effects.
On a more personal note, I would have liked to see more from Vail's Paul in the film. Sadly his screentime doesn't match some his younger co-stars but I really dug what he brought to the film and would have loved to see more of it. The scenes he had were all great - I could have just done with a few more!
Finally, I was extremely disappointed that nobody was killed with a vegetable this time round after the original's absolutely marvellous death by celery. You let me down there, Tommy!

VERDICT: Do you like slasher films? Do you like supporting independent horror? Do you want to see some genuinely funny, likeable protagonists get offed in imaginative ways?
Yes? WATCH Dollface.
It is smart, funny, creepy and just goes to show that the era of the slasher is far from over. I thoroughly recommend this film and I cannot wait to see what Tommy and the gang have lined up for us in the future -let's just hope it's not another 20 years before we can return to Dorchester's world.",1442793600,,6436,4.722419928825623
7315648,1,B010P5FMJ8,"if you love horror movies but hate how absolutely believable they've all become this is the perfect movie for you. it has plot holes a child could point out and the acting is some of the best ive ever seen. I may be skewed from only watching early seventies pornos but it was really quite a good show. I laughed I cried, I was scared this was supposed to be taken seriously. all in all it was truly worth any amount of money solely because of the heartfelt amazingly hip script. I applaud the director for his amazing grasp of how to shoot a movie eerily reminiscent of the wiggles.",1442620800,3,582,4.3
7315649,3,B010P5FMJ8,"Personally, I thought DOLLFACE was not scary, way too predictable and not particularly funny. IF I had nothing else to watch, I guess I'd watch it, but only once. There were some slightly amusing parts. but not enough to keep me wanting to watch the movie. It was like I kept waiting for someone or something to scare me and make me jump, but unfortunately, neither of those things happened. I was disappointed in this movie,  because there were so many ways that it could've been so much better.",1442534400,,496,4.573033707865169
7315650,4,B010P5FMJ8,"In the first film, a group of vacationing college students rent out a cabin on the lake where they find some mysterious dolls and learn the legend of Crinoline Head. It should come as no surprise to horror fans that they were killed off one-by-one until there were only two remaining. The sequel takes place 18 years later as we follow one of the survivors of the first film, Paul (played by Jason Vail in a nicely nuanced performance) who is now a professor at a local community college. When a few of his students decide to do a report on the local legend of Crinoline Head and the untold story of Dorchester Stewart, he tries to let go of the past butcan the past let go of him?

Among the students along for the ride we have the typical group of slasher meat: the jocks, the slutty girl, the good girl, etc. But, believe me, its all part of the fun. What follows is a glossy slasher that almost works better as a stand alone than it does as a sequel to the original Crinoline Head. Whereas the original had some great homage moments (the Sleepaway Camp 2 death comes to mind), the sequel takes another approach and handles the material extremely seriously. Turns out, thats exactly what it needed. Thats not to say there isn't a fair amount of comedy. In fact, the always awesome Debbie Rochon plays a country bumpkin that comes across as the daughter that Ethel (Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning) never had. Shes uproarious in her brief screen time and proves that you don't have to have a large role to make a big impact on a slasher fan.

As the friends start to pile up, the mystery starts to take hold and.well, youll just have to see for yourself. Bravo to Mr. Faircloth for creating a thoroughly entertaining and extremely polished slasher sequel that features some great deaths, a fantastic little Carrie homage, and some likable (as well as love to unlike) characters in a tight 95 minute running time. Keep an eye out on this one. Dont be surprised if this ends up being one of the best indie slashers of the year.",1442361600,,2035,4.438502673796791
7315651,1,B010P5FMJ8,"As amateur as you can get. This is just a poorly done killer at the camp flick with some of the worst acting and directing ever done on a DVD you can buy. It's mindbogglingly awful. The director couldn't direct a family thanksgiving dinner yet alone a movie. Putting the camera really close to the people's faces all the time only enhances how bad of an actor they are but oddly this wasn't noticed.  This is the worst of the worst. Yet there are a few ""5 star"" reviews here telling you how this is a ""classic"" and ""scary"" and ""well done."" Those are three sets of adjectives that do not describe this pile of junk in reality in this or any other dimension, unless you're SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON THIS AMATEURFEST. Clearly the people with the 5 stars were part of the production of this high school movie. Look at their other ""reviews"" or lack of them. I assure you, people don't go to some low level horror film festival that is a bunch of amateur ""movies"" and go to Amazon the next day and leave a review for one movie (like numerous ""reviewers"" with only one review here would have you believe).

Amazon was supposed to put a stop to the fake reviews but I guess that hasn't started yet.",1445472000,,1186,4.337837837837838

The details:
***The plot is very good actually. Its a lake house camping slasher film... sound familiar? There are some plot holes but nothing that takes away from the movie.
***The acting is average to bad. Some of the actors are so bad its kind of funny. The lead actor probably got paid the most because he is heads and tails above the rest.
***You would expect to see more gratuitous nudity in this movie. I guess they couldn't pay the actresses that much. As far as nudity there is very little and there is not a lot of gore.... Which I sort of like. Hundreds of gallons of red liquid splashed all a B movie is a little overdone now.
***This is NOT a movie for kids because of the very very very graphic language the trailer lady deals out.

Basically go in expecting a time killer movie that is on a budget and you will have a good time.",1443225600,6,1063,4.257425742574258
7315659,5,B010P5FMJ8,"Dollface aka Dorchester's Revenge - I have watched this numerous times via horror cons, film fests, and the vhs I bought (yes, the one with the tampon).  Its always a fun time.  To make this easy, here's a quote from my review over at Demons of Celluloid:

""To stand out from the crowd in a saturated genre, a film of this nature really needs amusing dialog, inventive kills, and great camerawork. We're given all that and more with Dorchester's Revenge. Debbie Rochon's boobs, fabulous drag queens, challenging shots, gorgeous scenery . There's a nostalgia factor, paying tribute to all that was great about the beloved slashers from back in the day. Simultaneously, we're given generous doses of modern humor.  Its just a damn fun film to watch. I wouldn't label it a horror-comedy, but its horror, and there's comedy.  The comedy isn't forced, and its effective.  #LOST.""",1442966400,,874,4.91156462585034
7315660,5,B010P5FMJ8,"Way back in 1995, director Tommy Faircloth made the slasher parody Crinoline Head, about a killer who wears a skirt on his head. You don't really need to see the original to see this sequel. While the original had a very low-budget indie feel, the sequel is a tight standalone flick with a retro slasher/horror comedy vibe. The opening scene shows us the event in 1980 that led to Crinoline Head being thrown in a mental facilityand the reason he wears a skirt on his head. Actually, in this sequel, its a skirt and creepy doll mask.

Turns out one of the survivors from the first movie is now a teacher. Hes pretty shaken up when his students announce they want to do a project on the legend of Crinoline Head. So they head into the woods to find the house in which Crinoline Head grew up. What follows is a horror comedy full of classic slasher elements, some fantastically campy situations, and raunchy comedy. But the comedy aspects don't get in the way of the conventional horror feel of the movie, which includes everything we expect and want from a slasher: creepy atmosphere, jump scares, sex, killer POV, tension building camera angles, and of course, an ominous masked killer. This is a fun one to show at a party.",1442966400,,1224,4.5636363636363635

8722900,3,B010P5FMJ8,"I don't know where to begin, it wasn't a great, i wouldn't pay money to view it. So unless it's free, i wouldn't watch it.
That being said, it was a decent ""horror"" movie, i think billed under a parody would have been better, because i laughed a lot (maybe out of pain?).

The plot is simple, a bunch of students are at college (?! maybe?) . Two guys decide to do their project on the Crinoline head killer (yeah..), Who the teacher is a survivor of the ""Crinoline head killer's massacre"" or something of that sort. So he ""accidentally"" leaves the files he researched about the crinoline killer, on his desk, and some other students decide to join the other group of two on the weekend outing to search for ""clues"" .
When going out to the lakehouse where the crinoline killer was, they meet Betsy (Debbie Rochon), who lives in a trailer on the land, rent free to keep trespassers off the land. So then three other horrible kids show up, and it turns into a slightly typical teen drinking by the lake movie, BUT! it's not so typical, everything seems cliche, but it has a lot of laughs. I never once was scared, or felt genuinely concerned for any character.  Naturally some Drag Queens are driving out to the forest to perform at a dive bar (?! why) . So the killer starts killing and stuff. It's not a well developed plot, or story, or why he wears the crinoline on his head, or why someone thought that would be a good idea.
Oh well. It's watchable on a humor standpoint, but i wouldn't recommend paying for it.
