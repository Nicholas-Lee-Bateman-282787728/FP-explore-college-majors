8351588,2,B00260HEVK,"Video quality was good but didn't contain anymore info than the TV show.  So it's good for ideas but no details for a novice.  Plus the vehicle prices stated were about half the price I could find a running Grand Cherokee for and theirs was mint.  Then there was thousands in upgrades that were free because they took them off another project or got them from a buddy for a steal.  So the title should be $10,000 Grand Cherokee.  So very disappointed since I only bought the DVD for the details not covered on TV...mainly how to make custom bumpers.  Plus thought in a few years if it only cost $5000 I'd tear into my tired Grand and have a nice toy.  Gave it 2 stars because of video quality and it is cheaper than buying all the episodes.",1296086400,2,740,4.280575539568345
