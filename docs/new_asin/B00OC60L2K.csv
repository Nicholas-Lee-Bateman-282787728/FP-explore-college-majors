8683154,5,B00OC60L2K,I have enjoyed the inticat layers of Difiance as it fights its way to survive in an Earth that had been transformed by alien means into a world that lends itself to allegory through the lense of Science Fiction.

8683157,5,B00OC60L2K,"3502 BCE - Indogene scientists discover that a star is on a collision course their solar system, the Votanis System. It takes them decades to convince the governments of the other planets that destruction is coming. Fortunately, obliteration is not immediate, because they've first got to invent the propulsion and suspended animation systems to take an Ark Fleet millions of light years away, to the third planet orbiting a yellow dwarf star in a spiral galaxy.

3001 BCE the Ark Fleet departs and the Votanis System is shortly after destroyed. The Ark inhabitants now have no home to return to. 5000 years later, Earth scientists first detect the approaching fleet. It arrives in 2013.

At first, it looks like there may be peaceful co-existence, but there are too many aliens (Votans) who want a new home. There is too much fear in the humans and too much mistrust all around. After a human assassinates the Votan ambassador to the United Nations in 2023, the horrific Pale Wars begin. By the time an armistice is declared in 2031, much of Earth has been terraformed.

There's still a lot of mistrust, but there's one place where humans and Votan have patched together a mostly working peace, the city of Defiance, erstwhile St. Louis. In 2046, scavengers Nolan and his Irathient daughter Irisa arrive at Defiance, and our tale begins.

This is rollicking good science fiction - impossible to be bored. You can buy each of the seasons separately. See the reviews on the separate seasons' DVD sets for specifics on the series.
