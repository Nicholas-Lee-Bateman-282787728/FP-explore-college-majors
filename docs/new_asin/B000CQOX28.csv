Now, one would think ""Beyond the Basics"" would be about making your writing richer and deeper, thereby adding to your opportunity in creating a powerful, sellable screenplay. Nope! It's a bunch of annecdotes, stories and pseudo advice that may help if you're a total idiot. Now, if you don't know enough to get the correct spelling for a producer you're querying, then you're the type of moron this is for. Otherwise, I challenge anyone who's watched this long winded, self gratuitous monologue to find anything that can deliberately and directly enhance your writing or career in any way, shape or form.

He spends five minutes reading a hate letter addressed him, to what point I don't know. Unlike more instructional DVD's in this series, there's no Q&A section no doubt simply because there's nothing to be asked. Maybe, ""Richard, could you tell us another loosely organized story that makes some oblique point about writing and career or of your experiences in the world?"" This should've been called, ""An Afternoon of Vaguely Interesting Stories with Richard Walter"" or ""Screenwriting: Nothing Here to Help.""",1205798400,,1328,5.040909090909091
