8323911,4,B00000FELE,"""The Saints with Sister Wendy"" offers a brief overview of a number of saints with the help of illuminated manuscripts (now housed in Italy) created in the Middle Ages.  As this program is only 60 minutes long, however, Sister Wendy must move rather quickly from saint to saint, making for a somewhat hurried production.
Some of the major figures are covered here, like Peter, Paul, and John the Baptist, and some obscure ones too.  Saints that were once familiar to the populace (Lawrence for one) are ""rediscovered"" by Sister Wendy in the manuscripts.  And she doesn't shy away from controversy, either.  Sister Wendy readily admits that some saints were actually fabrications (Christopher) or were made out to be more than they were (George and the Dragon).
In all, I enjoyed the program.  It just seemed to be too little, and over too soon.  A 3 or 4 hour program, like Sister Wendy's ""Story of Painting,"" might be in order!",1062288000,,927,4.79874213836478
8323912,3,B00000FELE,"While this could not be called a best effort for Sr. Wendy, it is still a thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening trip into the world of the Saints and the artwork they inspired.  Sr. Wendy brings her own straight forward and sometimes humorous insight into each piece.  What one can not fail to recognize is the love of both the world of art and her own faith that constantly shines through.",969753600,7,390,4.557142857142857
