3916827,1,B002EBRF88,I am so tired of filmakers trying to remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We are constantly being smothered with new filmakers trying to recapture the original vibe of the above mentioned film. This film put me to sleep. Do not waste your time. The Texas remake in 2003 is far better than this if that tells you anything! Cameron should try to make an original film based on new ideas. Pointless gore and horrible music. Better luck next time....,1254873600,4,445,4.6455696202531644
3916828,1,B002EBRF88,"I am going to assume that the reviewers are family or friends. If not, they need to see more horror films.

I'll just give you the lowdown in a few points.

Story-Several young people are walking through Virginia in 1969 and meet up with a crazy family. There is a little more to the story but that is the setup. Wow, original!

Acting-It wasn't completely horrible since they mostly talked for the first hour.

Gore-Nothing happened for the first hour and then there were maybe two decent scenes, but nothing you haven't seen if you've watched any torture-porn type movies in the last 5 years.

Scare factor-Zero! I don't know what else to say. There was no tension whatsoever. I swear that there was more tension and suspense in a Disney movie. I am not kidding!!

There is more to complain about but I'll just leave it that Cameron Romero should stay away from making movies and leave it to his father. I haven't liked all of George Romero's films but he knows what he's doing.",1254268800,16,980,4.5397727272727275
3916829,2,B002EBRF88,"Every cliche you associate with the Crazy Redneck Slasher genre is here in this movie. The sexed-up hitchikers, the broken down truck, the mentally challenged son, the meat hooks and the dirt-poor overbearing extended family who just might be having you for dinner if you don't stop running round in circles. I personally have seen all this before and better told. Because the movie was so obvious I kind of wondered why Cameron Romero bothered? Its tired and jaded and didn't get a cinema release in the UK. Also there are huge plot holes and inconsistencies. I would say avoid!!",1254009600,8,580,4.81
3916830,5,B002EBRF88,"This was a classic horror film filled with suspense, action and a lot of gory moments. A classic from Cameron Romero who follows right in the dads Gorge Romero's footsteps. It had my wife and I jumping out of our seats. Lots of awesome killings and you can feel the suffering in the characters eyes.

3916831,5,B002EBRF88,"This movie was AMAZING.  Cameron Romero out did himself on this production.  The horror in this film was extremely intense, this film is not for the faintest of hearts.  TRUE HORROR!  Definantly an EXCELLENT buy.",1252281600,7,212,4.9714285714285715
3916832,5,B002EBRF88,"Staunton Hill is what every horror film aspires to be.  It is the ""real deal"" horror film that stays with you long after you watch it.  For those of you that are George Romero fans like I am -- you will be really glad that Cameron is following in his dad's footsteps.",1252108800,8,267,4.115384615384615
3916833,1,B002EBRF88,"I saw this low budget attempt at horror and was very disapointed. This film is so slow and feeble I had trouble sitting through it. I had thought that maybe G.Romero would have helped his son with the artistic side of film making but alas he was obviously busy elsewhere when his son made this movie. Boring, slow, bad acted, poorly directed. Stay clear of this rip off of a movie. It had shades of every hillbilly killing 20 somethings movie made{ Wrong Turn, The Hills Have Eyes, ect.} but failed to deliver even close to what these films captured with ease.",1289260800,2,560,4.5
3916834,1,B002EBRF88,"Several things. Cameron Romero must be adopted, or he hates his dad... because let me tell you this movie is an insult to the family name.  I love horror movies, but this movie is just simply bad.  Thats pretty hard for me to say, as I think horror movies are like pizza, or sex, even if its bad its still pretty good.  But this movie is just bad.  The plot is totally generic, like a complete ripoff of texas chainsaw, or wrong turn, or any number of other horror movies.  Some hikers break down, stumble across a lonely farmhouse, and torture commences.  Whoa, original eh?  Not really.

The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the footage itself is even bad, it looks like it was filmed with my grandmas camcorder from the 80's.

Even the scary bits, aren't scary.  The few killing scenes are totally without any kind of hoorah, theres just no spark.  Its not scary, its not really brutal, theres no sense of desperation, or 'oh crap' feeling towards the actors..  Just do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this pieces of garbage.",1286841600,,1029,4.44385026737968

3916836,3,B002EBRF88,"DIDN'T WE SEE THIS ONE BEFORE?

Everyone looked so familiar in this. If you are an avid horror movie fan you should feel at home watching this one. It is a Chainsaw Massacre rip off, better done than most. The Staunton family was great. Kathy Lamkin as the head of the clan was superb. The 6 college kids left much to be desired. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was just that the writer forgot to give them interesting character. I guess the wheel chair guy had already been done. If you like watching bloody women getting tied down and having their clothes removed to their undergarments, then this movie is for you.",1274486400,,625,4.434782608695652
3916837,4,B002EBRF88,"Kind of a 70's throwback, and of course it is pretty well a texas chainsaw rip-off,
but really a decent flick, especially considering the garbage that passes for horror at
your local cinema.  It is worth a watch, and like I said, nothing ground breaking here,
just a decent horror flick for a saturday nite...",1266710400,7,309,4.618181818181818
3916838,5,B002EBRF88,"I was skeptical about buying Staunton Hill at first because of the mixed reviews. What made me most intrested in this movie was that it was created by George A. Romero's son, but I don't want it to sound like thats the only reason I bought it. But as far as the movie goes, I enjoyed it, though there wasn't much blood or frantic chases. The story is original, which I like, and the acting was great! I woundn't per say that I would recomend it to anyone, but I can say that it good for any movie collecter such as myself, I have most of Cameron's fathers work and I would like to see more Cameron in there, so therefore I can sum this up by say, ""The movie wasn't bad, the acting was great, the story was original, and the stage setting was absolutley superb""",1261353600,5,760,4.1768707482993195
3916839,1,B002EBRF88,".......and why not?  His son Made it and it's terrible.  A feeble attempt to  make a Texas Chainsaw Massacre that fails at every turn.  In 1969 five young people are walking to Washington DC for an unspecified rally-apparently they are in Maryland but I cant specify to that.  They meet up with the typical cannibal family-a 500 pound Maw-a grandmaw who rides around in a wicker wheelchair and a behemoth retard. There is also a ringer and a red herring but the movie is so bad you don't even care about the no-surprise, surprise.  The torture-porn gore scenes are hardly original and worst of all- the movie just ends.  No end-it just ends.

The funny thing about Staunton Hill is all the 4 and five star reviews by reviewers who only have 1 review to their credit. Hmmmmm.  Could this be another red herring?  Or are these phony reviews actually written by George Romero to promote his sonny boys' movie? Shame on you George.  Maybe it's a kind of payback as one of the characters in this film tells his friends that ""Night of the Living Dead"" is the scariest movie ever made.  Dont you just love nepotism?",1257638400,7,1108,4.540404040404041
3916840,2,B002EBRF88,"Just finished watching this movie, as a matter of fact the credits are still rolling, and I must say I have not seen such bad acting and horrible plot in some time. I was so excited to see it after all the hype I read about it, and being such a fan of camerons father, I thought how could I go wrong. Well was I duped. I wonder if the vidoe store will give me my []back.  The amazing thing is that 6 veral young adults cant fight there way away from an elderly woman in a wheelchair, an obese woman who cant take 10 steps without running out of breath, and her half wit son. Seriously,  how stupid do they think we are.  My Recomendation..... Dont waste your time.",1256428800,8,664,4.092307692307692
3916841,4,B002EBRF88,"Somebody FINALLY got it right! I've been watching low-budget flicks for many years looking for something that could ever come close to the eerie feeling I got when first watching 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and although there have been some decent attempts along the way there have been MANY MORE awful ones, so it's nice to finally be able to say that 'Staunton Hill'-fits-the-bill! This is one creepy and disturbing flick! It's VERY realistic and never strays into unbelievable territory, building up slowly but steadily its sense of impending dread (much like the original 'Chainsaw') then unleashes its brutality in a quick and violent fashion that is grim, relentless and highly unpredictable! Seriously this movie was quite satisfying to behold! I have a very high standard for giving movies 5 stars (which is reserved only for the classics) but I want to give this one 4 1/2 stars because it's just a notch under classic! I must admit that I was almost going to pass this one up, thinking that Cameron Romero was just hitching a ride into movie making from his famous dad but horror fans should take note of the new Romero's talents! Mark my words, Cameron Romero will ALSO be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years! I'll certainly be looking forward to anything else he will be directing!",1255046400,4,1308,4.817777777777778
3916842,4,B002EBRF88,"Yes this was a typical Horror film but I have to say it looked visually beautiful. The cinematography was great! The story plot kinda wavers all over the place but some of the killings are unique and some of the acting is really good. I liked the lead girl, Cristen Coppen, you don't really get to see to much of her at the start of the movie but it makes for a better ending when you see her kick ass and pull out a great performance. For you guys you also get to see her take her top off and she has a smokin body. The guy who plays the drop out doc, Charlie Bodin, shows some really good emotion in some parts of the film. He seemed to go in and out for me but I actually ended up liking him. Kathy Lamkin you don't see to much of but she is not bad and the guy who is the killer, BJ Hendricks, impressive for not having any dialogue really. Hope this review is helpful. If you aren't willing to buy then for sure rent for something different.",1254873600,3,946,4.01058201058201
8367512,1,B002EBRF88,Pure trash.  You know you're watching garbage when you're rooting for the so-called bad guys to kill the so-called good guys.  The protagonists in this film made me want to puke.,1500163200,,178,4.709677419354839

8367515,1,B002EBRF88,"Putting it plainly this movie was simply not good on any redeeming level. If your looking for sheer terror this film doesn't deliver much at all. If your looking for gore, there is some but if your accustomed to movies like Hostel or the Hills Have Eyes remake your going to be dissapointed for certain. Even those films are rather weak compared to some I've seen. The gore is pretty good but on a scale of 1-10 it rated a minus 4 as far as I am concerned. There is no actual torture because the victims were all dead before they got butchered. The villains in this movie were not all that creepy or very scary at all. They were more like downright silly. The acting was pretty good though by a couple of the characters, and I think they deserve better than this because they do have some level of talent. There is a lot of good cinematography and some beautiful country in the process which I found really the only thing worth remembering about this movie. The worst thing is that the actors and their reaction to very horrifying moments were muted and seemed very unrealistic. Instead of screaming in terror, or begging with any real conviction they react more relaxed and sullen, not as people would in a real situation like this. The music was pretty original with some very good ideas. Other than that this movie fails on the scale or gore movie. It fails as a torture porn movie. It fails as much of a scary movie. And it's nothing what so ever like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That film had some very effective horror and some very terrifying moments. This is just plain dreck.",1367625600,2,1581,4.474048442906574
8367516,3,B002EBRF88,"I guess it's not hard to please me because I like this movie.
Yes we have seen films of this nature before but I especially love this sub genre which includes movies such as The hills have Eyes,Texas Chainsaw massacre,Timber falls and Backwoods just to name a few and I'm not saying this is as good as Hills,Chainsaw or Timber falls but it still works in my opinion.

Any movie in which the freaks in question skin their victims then throw the remains to the pigs is good in my book.
The characters were fun and campy ,the acting not bad and the story I found enjoyable as well.

The gore was done with old fashioned special effects,no CGI.
I love the old school way of doing gore. This gore was done very well for the budget and I have actually watched it three times and am buying the Blu ray even though I have the DVD..It's set in 1969 and it works as long as your not looking for every little detail or flaw.

I think it's a nice addition to the hillbillies from hell Genre. This rating system I have always found to be a bit odd because 4 out of 5 stars seems like a 9 out of a 10,I'm not saying that.

An Amazon 4 means you liked it,I liked it therefore I gave it a 4..On a 1-10 I would give it a 6",1335398400,3,1205,4.02928870292887
8367517,1,B002EBRF88,"I can tell you that most modern horror films end up leaving me feeling angry.  Angry that I had to endure some genuinely stomach-churning gore...for absolutely nothing.  Barbaric cruelty and sickening gore are givens in horror films these days, along with stock characters and lame formulas.

Just lame.  The film starts in 1969, although you'd be hard pressed to see any evidence that this movie is taking place at any other place than in a slasher film.  And, surprise, surprise, the bad guys are a superhuman inbred religious hillbillies.  What makes them superhuman?  Nothing, as near I can tell.  But they are.  Somehow a gasping, morbidly-obese mama, a handicapped old woman in a wheelchair, and their overweight, mentally-challenged dork overpower, murder and dismember every young person fighting for his or her life every time.  And the hillbillies spout Bible verses while skinning the young-uns.  Blah, blah, blah.

I mean, really, how many times are we going to have to sit through this garbage?

Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth a second of your time.

When this movie finally stops (leaving a little head-scratching to boot), words appear before the end titles that dedicates the film to, I'm guessing, the director's mother.  Which was like a murderer receiving a life sentence and standing up to say, ""I'd like to dedicate these proceedings to my mother.""  Ugh.",1325116800,,1392,5.12

8367519,2,B002EBRF88,"I had to forward through some of this. I blame the writer. Has some decent effects in the gore aspects and the camera work through these scenes is decent. Also decent panoramic work of the country side.

The worst is the plot. There is very little development. Was there something about a wealthy accident victim that needed feet? There is no close to the story if that is the case.",1298160000,2,382,4.457142857142857
8367520,1,B002EBRF88,"This movie is bad.  Not in a ""so bad it's campy"" way and not in a ""so bad it's disgusting"" way.  Staunton Hill is an amateurish mess from a director who is obviously learning his way around camera, plot, and actors.  And all of that is quite visible on screen.

Let's start with the plot.  Hitchhikers in the 70s stumble their way onto a cannibalistic family.  We know that it's the 70s because the fact is ham-fistedly made clear from the pick in the African-American guy's hair (Kiko Ellsworth as Boone) to footage of the race riots.  The fact that it's the 70s has almost no bearing whatsoever on the plot other than to remove the convenient issue of cell phones.  It does have one upside; the footage has the grainy feel of a 70s film.

SPOILER HILL: There's a subplot about attempting to graft limbs onto a dying girl. It takes place on an entirely different set, complete with an attractive assistant who never shows up elsewhere in the film.  The connection between this scene and the rest of the movie is Quintin (Charlie Bodin), a failed medical student who is conducting some unorthodox surgery - surgery we can only assume will save the dying girl that we know nothing about.

Quintin lures our unsuspecting victims to their doom with a friendly demeanor and an offer of a ride.  Romero doesn't seem to understand foreshadowing, because he makes it very clear that Quintin is actually part of the crazy family within the first ten minutes.  By the time it's revealed that Quintin is actually the mastermind of the operation, Romero intercuts the revelatory scene with every clue from the first half of the movie.  It's like horror movies for dummies -- Romero isn't confident enough either in his own filmmaking skills or the audience's ability to figure out that Quintin is actually a Really Bad Guy.  It robs the revelation of any suspense.

Like the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the crazy family is as much filled with lumbering monsters (B.J. Hendricks as the mentally-impaired Buddy) as it is with crazy old ladies (Sherry Weston as Geraldine) and fat people (Kathy Lamkin as Louise).  In fact, Lamkin is basically playing the same character she played in the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Unlike the original, Cameron confuses ""creepy"" with ""violent."" The purpose of having a character in an archaic wheelchair was to show how backwards the family was - and at the same time, show how they were willing to feed victims even to their elderly and infirm.  Here, Geraldine is a caricature.  Actress Weston looks far too young to be the crazy old lady and the director equips her with a taser capable of killing a man.  She actually takes out the fittest member of the group, Cole (David Rountree), by herself.

The list of serious flaws goes on and on.  The movie seems to center on the gutting and dismemberment of Trish (Paula Rhodes), intercut with dialogue from Boone as he explains the horrors that happen at a slaughterhouse: the animals are still alive as they are drained of blood, squealing.  Except that's not what happens to Trish.  She gets her eyeball caved in and is unconscious by the time the throat-slitting happens.  Staunton Hill's one chance at being horrifying is tripped up by a narrative that doesn't match what's on screen.

When hottie Jordan (Cristen Coppen) manages to escape, there's a final confrontation between two characters that happens so quickly, without any sort of drama, that it may well as well be two stuntmen duking it out. And it probably IS just two stuntmen.

Staunton Hill is more film project than film.  Here's hoping Cameron senior can teach his progeny a thing or two before he commits more movie mayhem.",1293062400,2,3682,4.755905511811024
