8505828,3,B006WQUHOU,"I got this movie because Bessie Love is in it.  It is a very early sound picture with all the faults that implies.  The sound quality is poor and the sets are static.  The plot needs work and the acting (except fot Miss Love)  is just acceptable.  If you want to see an example of what an early sound picture is like, or are a big fan of Bessie Love, then you should see this movie-if not, skip it.",1385078400,,398,3.9873417721518987
8505829,5,B006WQUHOU,"This 1929 film (All Talking as it says on the cover) is really a cute story of a nice, good-natured guy who just happens to be extremely rich and who falls in love with a middle class girl. The issue arising from their marriage isn't that his rich family won't accept her, it's that her middle class family has issues with him being rich! I don't want to spoil the fun of watching it for you, so I won't give away all the story plot, but it's great fun seeing how he breaks through their middle class ""snobbery"" towards him and becomes a beloved part of the family. It's a fun, and heart-warming, comedy.

Conrad Nagel plays the main part as the millionaire and does wonderfully portraying the character. His voice is always great to hear; that combined with his ease with the camera made him an easy switch from silent to sound film.
Leila Hyams plays the girl he falls in love with. She also acts with him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-In-A-Circus/dp/B003N2JKUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell In A Circus</a>&nbsp;which was made in 1933. Hell in a Circus is also worth watching, although the film quality in it is mediocre.
Bessie Love plays Hyams' little sister and is lots of fun to watch.
The rest of the characters who make up her family also do well in their roles.

The film quality is good. There are lines and flecks here and there, as there often are with older films, but the black/white balance is good (some older films the white gets washed out, but that is not the case here). Really the quality is quite good. The sound is also good and easy to hear. There are a couple of spots where it gets slightly muffled, but still able to be heard.

There aren't any special features or scene selections.",1373760000,3,1765,4.761437908496732
