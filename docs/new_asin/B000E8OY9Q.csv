8107278,1,B000E8OY9Q,"DO NOT BUY FROM DAAVEEDEE!

I ordered two DVD's on 5th July 2010 and paid for expedited shipping from the USA to Australia (US$65.96)
My package did not arrive.
I followed up on 2 more occasions, until finally my package arrived on 24th August 2010.
I requested a refund of the cost of expedited shipping as clearly I had not received the service I had paid for.  I was happy to pay standard shipping for what I received.
After several emails back and forth, Daaveedee finally agreed to refund me US$37.98 on the basis that they had incurred costs sending the DVD's to me three times (however at no stage did they provide proof of shipping).

I will not buy anything in future from this supplier.",1284336000,4,696,4.507936507936508
