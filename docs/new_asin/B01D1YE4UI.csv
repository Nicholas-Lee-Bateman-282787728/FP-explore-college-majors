7696120,3,B01D1YE4UI,"Produced at a time where porn with a story was meaning less and less, this somewhat fun look at a mobster who's moll ain't what she used to be. The action is hit and miss.. Not enough Ginger Lynn by any stretch of the imagination. Production values (I'm really saying this?) are quite good and there is clearly an effort being made. Trashy Lady?? Depends on taste, but still ok for what it aspires to be.",1462838400,11,404,4.328947368421052
7696121,5,B01D1YE4UI,"I've gotten almost every Vinegar Syndrome 35mm Classic blu-ray in the last few months
This release is there best hands down
Originally released on dvd by TVX on March 2005 this dvd has been long out of print and super expensive selling for over $150.00 still factory sealed
even used you'll pay close to $100.00
If it was ever on laserdisc I'm sure it's close to impossible to find
Which makes this blu-ray/dvd combo all the more enticing
This is without a doubt a full blown Collector's Edition
disc one (blu-ray) is Region Free  disc two (dvd)also region free  with original artwork on disc
The new commissioned art work is awesome it's simple but, very old Hollywood looking
Special Features include:
***Scanned and restored in 2k from 35mm original camera negative,
**** First ever audio commentary with DP Tom Howard, moderated by filmmaker David McCabe,
**** Audio commentary with co-star Herschel Savage and XRCO co-founder Bill Margold,

Ginger Lynn,  Tom Byron Amber Lynn, Bunny Bleu, Cara Lott,Harry Reems, Herschel Savage

Trashy Lady is a period piece set against the backdrop of the roaring 1920's Chicago underworld, during the days of prohibition, well-dressed gangsters and tommy-guns. Harry Reems plays mobster, Dutch Siegel, who has just been dumped by his filthy mouthed girlfriend, Cara Lott. Shortly after, he falls for the new cigarette girl, Ginger Lynn, whom he meets at his posh club. Dutch wants Kitty as his dame, but a problem exists - she's too classy for him. Kitty is a lady and Dutch likes his dames trashy. He employs a local whore, Rita, played by Amber Lynn, to teach Kitty the 'right' ways to act. His problems are compounded when another local mobster, Big Louie decides to take revenge against Dutch because he believes that he's been sleeping with his girl, sparking a small gang war.

The PQ is close to flawless (none of the screenshots of this blu ray will do it justice)
This is Ginger Lynn during her peak and she is breathtakingly beautiful
People forget how much of a real game changer she was for the adult entertainment industry
She is a cross between a young Madonna and Michelle Pfeiffer  (She was on the same level as Supermodels of this time period)
If you are a huge Ginger Lynn fan this New release is a must own
If you have the original out of print dvd this is a solid gold upgrade all around
Phenomenal job by Vinegar Syndrome between this release and Dolemite Collector's Edition blu-ray
I'm beyond impressed and still a life long fan!  10/10
Hopefully more Ginger Lynn, Christy Canyon, Nina Hartley, Barbara Dare, and Angel Kelly films get the 2k remastered treatment

I did finally see this, and don't recall what I paid, but this is an all natural, v. well-directed film--good acting
as well. The players are v. attractive, and as above, this is in clear color. This film is not distasteful. And there is a bonus film, 50 or so minutes,  all natural as well.",1488758400,,458,4.264367816091954

8754683,4,B01D1YE4UI,"Probably the last gasp of quality production adult cinema...  the end of the ""Golden Age"".  Filmed on 35mm with quality sets, this film shows Ginger Lynn at her most beautiful best with her beautiful eyes and other attributes.  The mastering of the film brings out qualities that should be applied to other films of the period.  Story itself is standard fare but the quality of everything sets if off.  A nice bonus is a film, maybe the first film, of the director of 'Trashy Lady' from 1971.  Again, excellent mastering makes it a nice addition to the package.",1476835200,8,561,4.673469387755102

8754686,5,B01D1YE4UI,"Dcidment, 'Vinegar Syndrome' s'impose comme l'diteur de rfrence en la matire: de nombreuses sorties, toujours de qualit! Ici, nous avons le plaisir de retrouver 'Trashy lady' opus de choix de Steve Scott en cette anne 1985: ""les deux Lynn"" et Harry Reems (apprcis galement cette mme anne dans l'excellent 'G Spot' d'A.Mitchell), c'est dj tout un programme! L'histoire de gangster n'est cependant que trs superficielle ici (on est trs loin de l' exceptionnel 'Dixie Ray Hollywood Star' de Spinelli) mais ce n'est gure gnant, l'intrt essentiel du film tournant autour du dcorum: costumes, dcors, musique, le casting tant excellent tout comme les scnes de sexe fort nombreuses et russies; La forme est donc privilgie sur le fond  demeurant lui, prtexte anecdotique (ce n'est pas 'Take off' d'A.Weston!). Donc tenant compte de cela, tout semble alors parfait et ralis avec grand soin. Harry Reems, pour ne parler que de lui, s'avre formidable comme  son habitude, trs factieux, en un mot: irrsistible. Mais absolument tout le monde est au mieux ici! (Amber Lynn particulirement bien mise en valeur). Luxueux, minimaliste mais trs attrayant, une ralisation qui se dmarque du tout venant:  voir et revoir sans problme.

[Edition de grande qualit: Blu-ray dlivrant une image fort riche assez impressionnante (Bitrate trs lev) la sonorit tant trs intelligible (le DVD est lui mme  la hauteur des esprances); cot bonus, les commentaires audio proposs sont instructifs et distrayants. Maintenant le bonus majeur: trs agrable film naturiste ('hard') du dbut des annes 70 tourn par le mme ralisateur, dans lequel nous trouvons trois belles jeunes femmes, un cow-boy et un indien. J'ai beaucoup aim car nous sommes en pleine nature et c'est beau et rafrachissant!]",1468800000,4,1751,5.261648745519714
