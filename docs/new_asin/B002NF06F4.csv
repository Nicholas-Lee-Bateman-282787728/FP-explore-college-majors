8375008,5,B002NF06F4,I just love this drama.  Zai Zai is great as always and the story is very entertaining.  All the characters stand out.  One of the best endings I have every seen.  I recommend this highly.,1340668800,2,188,4.285714285714286
8375009,5,B002NF06F4,"Vic does it again. So far it just seems like he can't make a bad film. And this time he is playing with a real cutie. At first I didn't think so---I thought she was almost pretty. But as the film goes on, you see why she is known for her beauty. She is Jay Chou's ex, and easy to see what he saw in her.
She is the student of a master chef who yells in the kitchen (Ala Gordon Ramsey), and bullies her, but she hangs in there, no matter what. In fact, this drama helped me understand Gordon! Since I have worked in restaurant kitchens and loved it, I loved this---they must have hired a real chef to advise, because the things they say about food are right on target not just made-up dialog for the film!
The story is non-stop good, no boring parts, and a heartstring tugger, with a very nice sound track. I had to give this five stars, wish I could give it more.
The more I watch, as in all asian films, the more I see that I missed-it just gets better and better.",1271462400,2,965,4.03125
