7863411,5,6304168187,"Okay, so maybe it's not the MOST accurate representation of a biblical story that I've ever seen, but it's definitely my favorite!  Children of all ages will delight in the creativity that Angelica, Tommy, Chuckie, and the gang bring to this video.  If you're offended by the historical inaccuracies, take a moment to consider the audience toward whom the video is directly, and appreciate that Nickelodeon is attempting to educate our children.  You can always go back and make minor changes in your kid's understanding of the story later on.  Besides, they'll probably be thankful that the story was presented in such a fun way.",1049328000,6,630,4.9714285714285715
7863412,5,6304168187,"Best Rugrats episode  EVER.  This episode exceeds all other Rugrats episodes.  OK so it is not 100 per cent true to life but it is a CARTOON.  I mean how often do Hollywood get it spot on not very often if I remember well.  The babies and the adults all get locked in the attic one by one and all hear and take part in the exodus.  Angelica as Pharaoh, well I will never look at the Sphinx in the same light again, and the mobile phone with the cartouch's on was just so HER. No the story is not the one we read in the Good Book but it is fun and there are some good one liners (from the adorable Miss P)and that is how we should view it.  Watch it and SMILE.",1035849600,3,659,3.837037037037037
