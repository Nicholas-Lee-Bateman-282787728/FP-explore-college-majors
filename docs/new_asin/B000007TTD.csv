7905269,5,B000007TTD,"I have to say that these videos are good. The first tape has the fights, and let me say that the brawls are good. Some scenes, YES,will be repeated but it has action. If you look closely at one of the players in the  video[LOOK CLOSELY] you will see Minor league player, and now NHL hockey  enforcer Shawn Antoski giving a good brawl at a minor league game, and the  fans are loving it, including a little boy. The music is good, they use  keyboards for the music, it is really nice. You will not see Nhl Action at  all, but You will see minor league hockey fights. The second tape has  footage of Nhl hockey of the past, and present Minor league action-talking  about how hockey is played. Some scenes will use 80's music with good  beats, and other hockey scenes will feature I believe a 50's or 1960's  song. I guess many wanted too see Nhl hockey enforcers, enforcing their  tough law policies on court, but minor league action is very good too, I  believe.  If your an individual who just wants too see a great hockey  fight[s]. These videos are for you,it is all about entertainment. I highly  recommend it.",953251200,,1113,4.41871921182266
