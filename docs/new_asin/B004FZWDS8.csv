4371719,4,B004FZWDS8,"World Champion Edge vs. Dolph Ziggler - Just think that it was going on 5 years ago that Dolph was in a cheerleader outfit yelling ""NICKY!"" to now in a World Title match on a PPV. Dolph's girlfriend & Edge's ex-wife, Vickie Guerrero, assumed the role of acting-General Manager of SmackDown & banned Edge's trademark move of the ""spear"" stating that he would lose the championship if he used the move in the match. Dolph continued to deliver an impressive performance here as he heavily worked on Edge's neck with moves like a heavy focus on the side headlock while even taking a nasty fall on an attempted Fameasser turned into a powerbomb by Edge. Edge told the story well of him being so used to setting up the spear that he had to come up with other holds to use during the match including a different variation of the scorpion deathlock along with other moves & some ""lie, cheat, steal"" tactics we've seen in the past & a finishing hold that we've seen someone real close to Edge use as well. With a surprise appearance from a SmackDown diva who had enough of Vickie Guerrero's involvement, this was a good match.
As a side note, this was one of the matches that if you heavily pay attention to the announce team then I would mute the match as they were more concerned about telling Vickie Guerrero jokes than anything else & it showed as Matt Striker would keep asking Lawler the same question while Michael Cole was trying to make a valid point only for both Lawler & Striker to not be paying attention.

WWE Champion The Miz vs. Randy Orton - Orton was dominate from the opening gate here as it took help from Alex Riley for Miz to gain an advantage. From here, the match had a good mix of everything from brawling to wrestling with Orton doing his father's famous superplex to submissions like Miz attempted the camel clutch. However it was the surprise appearances here (including a moment where Alex Riley was launched to the outside) that were the bigger story at the end of the night leading Miz to retain his championship.
Just like how the first match had bad commentary on it, this was no different as Michael Cole just went overboard with his heel persona & Miz praise that it just heavily distracted me to the point where I actually put the match on mute.

WWE Divas Champion Natayla vs. Eve vs. Michelle McCool vs. Layla - This was originally suppose to be a handicap match but the RAW General Manager stepped in stating that there will no longer be any co-Divas Champions & added Eve to the match. LayCool still worked together as a team throughout the match with each member targeting either Natayla or Eve but at one point had a big stare-down realizing that there could be only one champion. The match had it's moments like Natayla executing a double sharpshooter while McCool took a nasty fall backwards to the outside but Eve was able to take advantage of the fatal four way rules (in controversial fashion) to regain her championship.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - WWE added a different element to the Rumble this year in that they added 10 more participants to make this the biggest Rumble of all time with 40 men. As usual, there were plenty of highlights here...the fight between the New Nexus & The Corre, Daniel Bryan & C.M. Punk starting out with references to them being no strangers to each other with their past in the ""minor leagues"", Morrison showcasing his par-kor ability, Chavo Guerrero having his moment, the domination of the New Nexus including the confrontation between the returning Great Khali & Mason Ryan, the return of Booker T...SUCKA!, John Cena going after Nexus, Hornswoggle (I couldn't stop laughing), Kevin Nash returning as Diesel & his stare-down with Big Show (not to mention Striker's reaction to it), Alberto Del Rio's entrance, the reaction (or lack of it) for the Cena/Orton showdowns, the shocking elimination of John Cena, and the battle between the final two. This was a very entertaining Rumble.

In the end, I really liked this Rumble from top to bottom with the only things I really didn't care for being that the commentary was just bad in the first two matches so this is something I'd check out.",1296691200,,4164,4.630581867388362
4371720,3,B004FZWDS8,"A decent ppv but could have been better. Overall entertaining with a couple of mark out moments.

This was the thinnest card in Royal Rumble history. However, the promotion of the ppv was done very well with the hype of the first ever forty man Royal Rumble.

It did live up to most of the hype. As so many others have pointed, the booking was pretty bad as far as the actual match goes, but the singles matches were good.

Edge and Dolph- They wrestled for nearly thirty minutes in a pretty fast paced match that saw numerous pinfalls and hits. Edge just won the title a little more than a month, so needless to say he would retain. However, the feud between him and Dolph is far from over. The Wwe's push of Dolph to Main Event caliber status is well timed in a period where they are clearly pushing newer guys to the top.

Miz vs. Orton-Again no brainer than Miz would retain. The E's booking for Miz has been less than stellar. I mean for a guy whose supposed ""Awesome"" they really made him look to be pretty weak (almost losing to Jerry Lawler in a ladder match, constantly needing some outside force to retain). This was no different, Orton is about to win the match when Punk and Nexus comes out. Still this was a good match despite everything. Miz luckily hangs on to the title till his next defense.

Royal Rumble Match

-Entertaining but a mess as well

-Before the ppv itself Punk was highly touted to be the favorite for the match. After the E failed to turn Cena heel, they decided to take a new course of events which would see two divisions of the Nexus-One led by Cm Punk and the other by Wade Barrett.

The E looked like they were going to push Nexus again and for the most part of the Rumble that was the case as Punk avoided elimination many times from help of his Nexus members.

The Wwe then as expected had Cena run wild on the Nexus and anyone else in the way all the while having worthless guys like Hornswoggle (WTF!!)in the match. Even Michael Cole was annoyed.

The rest of the match had a couple of bright spots which tried to elevate this mess to a higher level  like Booker T's return which barely last sixty seconds, and Diesel's short return.

Inexplicably though, perhaps the most hyped return never happened as HHH sat this one out.

The drawing of the end of the match got messier and more bizarre with guys like Santino and Miz coming out and interfering with the match.

Eventually once this mess cleared up, Alberto Del Rio came out from the rumble as the winner much to the crowd's disgust.

Thoughts: A decent ppv but once again the booking team still underutilized their talent, and a lot of spots in the match didn't make any sense and hurt the ppv somewhat.

 It's the first ppv of the New year, so it's expected that things were not going to be very polished. While I agree with some of the critiques out there, I don't think it was as horrible as some people made it out be.

It was an entertaining ppv which is the main thing that the E is selling.

Alberto's win is shocking but not totally unfeasible as Vince in the last couple of years has been willing to push the newer talent well beyond their expectations of the company.

It'll be interesting to see what their plans will be for a lot of these guys in the upcoming months.",1296432000,,3276,4.339344262295082
4371721,5,B004FZWDS8,"""Royal Rumble 2011"" is a must-own event for any WWE fan.  It cuts the crap, gets right to the action, fires on all cylinders, and delivers on every front.

1) World Heavyweight Championship
Edge (champion - Loses Title If The Spear Is Used)
v. Dolph Ziggler (w/ Vickie Guerrero)
---To be honest, this match takes a little while to get moving.  To continue from their ""SmackDown"" match just days prior, Edge targets Ziggler's ribs right away, which makes Ziggler look like he doesn't stand a chance of winning this title bout.  But the cocky challenger keeps hanging in there, helping this opener become the back-and-forth contest we love in championship matches.  I think what I loved best about this match is that it feels like a real battle is going, thanks to both good chemistry and a 20-minutes-plus time length.  Also, this one avoids the usual signature move/finisher fest routine.  That clich is thankfully sidestepped for a much more creative showdown.  Simply put, any doubts that Edge or Ziggler would get the short end of the stick can be put to rest.  This is a great way to kick off the show, and we're just getting started.
""8.0 / 10""

-------------------------------------------

2) WWE Championship
Randy Orton v. The Miz (champion - w/ Alex Riley)
---I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to this one.  I thought their Tables Match at the ""TLC"" PPV was decent, and I still have a tough time getting behind Orton as a good guy.  But I was proved wrong.  These two delivered a smart match where it looks like guys are trying to win the title, rather than just senseless highspots or easy crowd-pleasing shenanigans.  The Miz is already becoming a big star that people are paying to see, and his in-ring talent will definitely keep him in the game if he wants to be.  And Randy Orton, in spite of a character that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, knows how to be a cold, calculating, & methodical competitor without boring the audience to death.  The run-in interference might be a little cheap for some viewers, but I think it opens up a lot of possibilities.  I look forward to seeing where it goes.  Until then, enjoy this quality match between two of WWE's most talented.
""7.5 / 10""

-------------------------------------------

3) Divas Championship
Michelle McCool v. Layla v. Natalya (champion) v. Eve Torres
---This was scheduled to be a Lay-Cool/Natalya 2-on-1 Handicap Match.  Frankly, I'm glad they did away with that one because this rivalry already got 4 consecutive PPV appearances.  To my astonishment - and I think even the Boston crowd would agree - this was a very entertaining match.  The whole match just flowed well, and there weren't any huge slip-ups that we normally see in Divas matches lately.  Team Lay-Cool even teased possibly squaring off against each other.  This match also features a Sharpshooter that Bret Hart never attempted (I won't ruin it).  Hell, even the winning pinfall was unique, and opens up some possibilities (not giving that one away, either).  And even though I'm not a huge fan of Eve Torres, I'll say this much: That moonsault is one of the best I've ever seen.  So, what if you don't like to watch women's wrestling?  Watch this, and choke on it!
""7.0 / 10""

-------------------------------------------

4) 40-Man Royal Rumble
---I say this year after year: These Rumbles are so long and complicated that it would take forever to tell you what went down.  The best way I can summarize this is that it's basically 2 parts.  I'd call Part 1, ""CM Punk and The New Nexus"", and Part 2 would be ""The 15-Man Royal Rumble"" (give or take a few wrestlers).  My basic guidelines for good Rumbles are Surprises and Action.  Keep it unpredictable, and keep it going.  That's what I look for in Royal Rumbles.

So, what's good about this first-ever 40-Man Royal Rumble?
+ If you thought CM Punk was hilarious in the 2010 Rumble, wait till he works his butt of to get you hate him and The New Nexus.  It's so aggravating, it's hilarious!
+ Daniel Bryan and John Morrison were very impressive while they were in it.  Bryan just dished out and took some serious beatings, while Morrison avoided losing the Rumble in a jaw-dropping display of parkour.  Trust me; you've never seen anything like Morrison's athleticism tonight!
+ To play off The New Nexus' dominance, the other force to be reckoned with was John Cena & Hornswoggle.  Yes...you read that right.
+ Although many people will ruin this surprise, I promise you've never seen an over-the-top Royal Rumble end the way this one does!  I mean that as a compliment.
+ Just when you think you know who's gonna win this Royal Rumble, the rug gets pulled from underneath you.

So, what didn't I like about this Royal Rumble?
+ While it was neat to see Booker T & Diesel make surprise appearances, they didn't last long or do a whole lot.  Diesel, especially, didn't impress anyone, and fans booed loudly that his appearance was so short.
+ For all of the potential New Nexus-vs-Corre action, there wasn't a whole lot of it.  Maybe that will take place in the weeks to come.  I liked the way they started the Rumble with an all-out brawl, but I guess I wish there was more to play into the whole piece.
+ God bless for putting in extra hard work, but I'm torn on whether I liked Dolph Ziggler and Randy Orton being allowed to participate in this Rumble, after already having championship matches.  I dunno, flip a coin on that one.

Overall reactions?  This first-ever 40-Man Royal Rumble was one of the best.  It's exciting, keeps the surprises coming, and just keeps moving.  Sure, there's the inevitable slowdown and a predictable entrance here and there.  But this is 60-plus minutes I'd gladly watch again.

OVERALL
The 2011 ""Royal Rumble"" is terrific entertainment.  This is not just for WWE fans; pro wrestling buffs of any kind can get into this one.  Buy It, Download It, Steal It, Pirate It...I don't care what you do.  Watch it somehow, some way.  If the programming stays this good, ""WrestleMania XXVII"" is going to be a show for the ages!",1296432000,3,6118,4.727788279773157
4371722,4,B004FZWDS8,"The booking and buildup to this ppv was rather poor, but the show itself was anything but.  There were only four matches, but three of them were very good and the show as a whole was highly enjoyable, with a few pretty big surprises.  Certainly a worthy Royal Rumble to add to your collection.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1.  World Heavyweight Championship Match
Edge (c) vs. Dolph Ziggler w/ Vickie Guerrero

Stipulation is if Edge uses the spear, he will be stripped of the title.  On a side note, has a challanger for a world title ever been built up worse than Dolph Ziggler?  This was a really good opener, and in my opinion the best match of the night.  Match started off slow and the crowd was fairly quiet, but they built the match nicely and by the end the crowd was super into all the near falls, legitamately buying the fact that Ziggler might win.  Vickie was her usual self on the outside, and after a little too much interference, Kelly Kelly ran down and tackled her and pounded on her, which the crowd thoroughly enjoyed.  The ref took a bump, and with Vickie and the ref both down, Edge used the spear on Ziggler, which is apparantly ok if thousands of people at home and in the arena see it, but not the ref or the acting GM.  He then hit the impaler (yes, Christian's finisher) on Ziggler for the three count.  Very good opener.  ***3/4

2.  WWE Championship Match
The Miz (c) w/ Alex Riley vs. Randy Orton

Good match, but not as good as the former.  They had a back and forth battle, and after another ref bump, for some unexplicable reason the ""new nexus"" came out, minus CM Punk, and distracted Orton.  Riley then snuck up behind Orton, but Orton foiled his plan and threw, and I mean THREW Riley over the top and onto the Nexus.  This was great.  Orton then hit an RKO on Miz, but with Orton distracted by this, Punk came up from under the ring and hit the GTS on Orton, allowing Miz to crawl on top of Orton for the win.  Good match, and the interference, despite happening for the second match in a row, didn't seem to hurt the match.  ***1/4

3.  Divas Title Match
Natayla (c) vs. Michelle McCool vs. Layla vs. Eve

The magical GM chimed in before the match and changed this from a handicap match to a fatal four way match with Eve added to it.  This was ungodly horrible, just a complete mess with one botched spot after another.  Not one thing looked even remotely good in this match.  At the end, Eve hit a moonsault on Layla and Michelle did something to Natayla (I don't remember what), and both got the three count, but the ref only saw Eve so she won the belt.  She actually was crying after the match.  Could be because it was so bad, because I felt like crying myself having to watch it.  A generous 1/2*

4.  40 Man Royal Rumble Match

Punk came out first, and after that all the members of the Corre (what a stupid name) and the new Nexus came out and brawled, and the GM sent them all to the back.  Number 2 was Daniel Bryan, and this ruled for the 90 seconds he and Punk were allowed to work together.  After that mostly jobbers came out for a while, with the occasional well known superstar (I hate that term).  There was an amazing spot with John Morrison, who was knocked off the apron but grabbed hold of the barricade on the outside without touching the floor, and then walked on the top of the barricade and jumped onto the stairs and back into the ring.  This was completely awesome.  He was eliminated soon after.  For a while all the members of the Nexus were together, and they dominated the match throwing guys out one at a time.  This went on untill Great Khali came out and eliminated Husky Harris, and after Khali was tossed, Booker T made his return to wwe and got a HUGE pop.  Booker was eliminated pretty quick and the crowd did not like that at all.  Cena eventually came out and super cena'd everyone out the ring, and teamed up with hornswoggle for a while eliminating geeks.  Better wrestlers started coming out at this point and the match was picking up.  Next biggest surprise was the return of Big Daddy Cool Diesel to an ENORMOUS pop.  The crowd chanted Diesel's name for the entire time he was in the match (which wasn't that long), and after he was eliminated they still chanted his name.  This was bizarre, but pretty awesome.  Diesel and Booker T got by far the biggest reactions of anyone or anything on this show.  Alberto Del Rio was # 38, with car entrance and all, and before he got to the ring Orton came out at # 39 and attacked him.  Kane was # 40 but was quickly eliminated my Mysterio.  It came down to Wade Barrett, Alberto Del Rio, John Cena, and Randy Orton.  Alex Riley (who was at ringside with Miz, who was doing commentary) came over and distracted Cena, who was then thrown out by an interfering Miz, much to the crowds seeming delight.  Orton then threw out Barrett, and Del Rio came up from behind and eliminated Orton to seemingly win the rumble.  But wait...Santino Marella had been knocked to the outside earlier, but not over the top rope.  With the crowd going crazy as an unknowing Del Rio sauntering around the ring, Santino snuck into the ring and hit the cobra on Del Rio.  Santino then tried to throw Del Rio over, but Del Rio reversed the attempt and threw out Santino for the victory.  As a whole, the match never was boring and they kept the ring pretty clear the whole match, which went about 70 minutes long.  This wasn't the best Rumble match there's ever been, but I thought it was a very good, solidly entertaining match, and it was nice to see Alberto Del Rio win the match.  Finally something different for a change.  ***1/2

This was a very enjoyable show.  There wasn't anything blowaway or fantastic, but the show flowed nicely as a whole, and besides the women's match, I was thoroughly entertained throughout.  Certainly a DVD I would consider adding to your WWE collection.",1296345600,4,5904,4.3834101382488475
4371723,3,B004FZWDS8,"The road to WrestleMania begins with a promising PPV. The surprise returns of Booker T and Kevin Nash would be something to look for.

Dolph Ziggler VS World Champion Edge: Smackdown always puts there best foot foward and this was no different. A great back and fourth encounter. I liked the ending where Edge uses the spear when the ref and Vickie are down then uses Christian's own finisher to pin Ziggler.

WWE Champion Miz VS Randy Orton: A decent match that was nothing out of the ordinary. Nexus comes down as CM Punk interferes and hits Orton with a GTS and puts Miz on top of Orton. Typical Raw material.

Natalya VS LayCool: This was turned into a triple threat with Eve, not Awesome Kong as people may have expected. Eve wins the belt with a cool looking moonsault. Typical diva fare, nothing speical.

Royal Rumble: I couldn't wait to see how it would pan out. Boy, was I disappointed! Punk enters #1, Bryan #2 and a dream match for fans takes place for at least a few minutes. The first twenty minutes or so were pretty good with a highlight for years to come was Morrison being thrown over the top rope, landed onto the barricade, ala Spiderman or RVD, and then jumping on the steps to avoid elimination. Truly awesome move. Nexus then all join in and eliminate everyone, even a returning Booker T. I knew Cena would be coming in sooner or later to take out Nexus but i'm glad they waited a few entrants before he arrived. Hornswoggle entering was a low point, no pun intended. Everyone looked shocked as Diesel returned and like Booker T, was eliminated way to fast. The end saw Del Rio throw out Orton but Santino was under the ring, returned, hit Del Rio with the cobra, but was eliminated. Del Rio is your 2011 Royal Rumble winner!

Overall, a disappointing PPV. Edge-Ziggler delivered, the other two matches were typical matches at best, and The Rumble was enjoyable but wasn't that great. I hope Diesel and Booker stay with WWE thru WrestleMania. Triple H didn't return as many thought. With the Elimination Chamber coming up, The Rumble seems to mean less every year. Not a bad PPV but nothing you need to go out of your way for.",1296345600,,2149,4.528350515463917
4371724,4,B004FZWDS8,"Both the World's title and the WWE title match were heart-pounding,back-and-forth rollercoaster of a ride which both ended with goofy ending with tons of interfernce. In my mind,The Miz can't keep the belt on his own without anybody helping him. The 4 way Divas title match was not great but pretty good. The 40 men Royal Rumble bout while too long for it's own good, it did had tons of nice twists & turns like Kevin Nash & Booker T bring in the match. The wrestling itself was pretty good.

This is one of those ""mixed feelings"" events for me. There were great moments, with one great match in particular, along with a few ""surprizes"" in the main event as well. But then there were some terrible moments, between Michael Coles overly obnoxious new attitude on commentary and the uber long Rumble match, whic

Now I'm going to review each match individually, but I WILL NOT give away any match results, I hate spoilers, so you will find none here.

1. World Heavyweight Championship Match w/ Stipulation-(If Edge uses the Spear on Ziggler, He will lose the World Heavyweight Championship)
(c) Edge vs. Dolph Ziggler (w/ Vicki Guerrero)

This was the best match of the night, one of the best openers I've seen in a long time, not to mention it was for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match had SO many nearfalls its not even funny, I mean, literally this match reminds me of Shawn Michael/Chris Jericho at WM19, but on a smaller scale, because no one will duplicate THAT match ever. But if you do buy this DVD, please buy it for the first two matches, because if you buy it for the Rumble match, you might be disappointed.

8/10-Excellent Match, Edge has never looked so good, and at the same time, made Dolph Ziggler a star.

2. WWE Championship Match
(c) The Miz (w/ Alex Riley) vs. Randy Orton

This was also a great match, not as good as the first, but still pretty good...up until one of the cheapest yet cleverest endings I've ever seen in a championship match, but don't let that spoil the wrestling portion of this battle. This match shows us that The Miz really can hang with the elites in the business, as he is a good wrestler. But in my honest opinion, The Miz looked better than Randy did for the majority of this match, and that's not a good thing, at least not at this stage in Randys illustrious career.

7/10-Good, solid championship match with some good spots, along with a few cheap ones. \

3. Fatal-4 Way Diva's Championship Match
(c) Natalya vs. Michelle McCool vs. Layla vs. Eve

Ok..so first off, this was scheduled to be a 2 on 1 handicap match for Natalya's title, but at the last minute the ""anonymous GM"" announced that Eve would be participating, making it a fatal-4 way. Natalya is a fantastic wrestler, maybe as good as Trish Status was in her prime, so she has a habit of making other women look really good in her matches. This was no exception, asit brought out the best in the 3, especially Eve, who is starting to emerge as a great wrestler herself.

5.5/10- Good match for a woman's fatal 4-way, had some good action, and a nice surprise ending. Worth seeing once.

4. 40-Man Royal Rumble Match-(for a shot at a world championship of the winner's choosing at WM27)

Ok...so before I give myself a headache, I'm just gonna use some quick bullet points, because there is A LOT to cover here.

A. A few ""surprise"" entrants make this match really, really fun at times. I felt like a friggen kid again.
B. There were 40 men here, but 10 of them were part of 2 different factions that just...*sigh*...I'll just say that this match is really frustrating for about 10 minutes, then it gets pretty damn good in the last parts.
C. The ending sucked, honestly, so don't expect some great unpredictable finish.
D. Like I said before, they only made this a 40 man match so that The New Nexus could dominate together for 20 minutes...worst decision of the night.

6/10-Bigger is not always better folks, lets just keep it at that for now. Has a few moments and unexpected returns that make this 90 minute Rumble worth sitting through, so enjoy it for what it's worth, but there's a reason this DVD is so cheap.

My review scores are based off of an average, so it's pretty simple stuff here. 1 = absolutley terrible and 10 = AWESOME!!!
I also give a rating for overall entertainment (basicically the storylines, along with all the wrestling)..I give it a 6 out of 10, but I'm in a good mood today.

Overall PPV score = 6.5 which in my book is a D+. Not a terrible event to own and the price is worth buying it, trust me.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match, Edge (Champion) vs. Dolph Ziggler w/Vickie Guerrero: After weeks of feuding it comes to a head here where on a recent Smackdown, GM Vickie said that if Edge used the spear he would lose the world title, so that added some tension to the match. The contest itself is quite good as the momentum shifted constantly, each guy got some good near falls in and Dolph did prove he could hang with a main eventer, kinda reminded me of Edge/Shawn Michaels at Royal Rumble '05 where the veteran Shawn helped establish Edge. The crowd did seem divded as there were some chants for Ziggler, then near the end with Vickie, the ref and Dolph down, Edge hits the spear, plays possum hits the Killswitch and covers Dolph to win. 9/10.

-WWE Championship Match, The Miz (Champion) w/Alex Riley vs. Randy Orton: At TLC Miz escaped with the title in a Table's Match, but there would be no running as Orton was looking to take the championship from the Miz in this rematch. Randy worked over Miz for a few then Miz took over, with Riley getting some cheap shots in when the ref wasn't looking, Miz does have a good showing here hanging with the Viper and wearing him down. There's the expected Orton comeback, Randy goes for the RKO but the Nexus comes down to the ring and Orton sends Riley over the top onto them. There's the RKO to Miz, CM Punk sneaks in and hits the GTS and Miz covers to win the match. 6/10, cause of the interference.

-Fatal Four Way Match for the Diva's Championship Match, Natalya (Champion) vs. Michelle McCool vs. Layla vs. Eve: This was originally supposed to be a 2 on 1 Handicap Match, but the Anonymous Raw GM chimes in and adds Eve to the mix. Its not a great match as the crowd didn't really seem to care, especially when Eve was announced as the fourth entrant. It is however passable and thankfully short as we see Eve hit the moonsault on Layla and covers her to win the title. 4/10, with the crowd again not really reacting too much, though Eve did seem happy to win, even crying as she walked up the ramp.

-The Royal Rumble Match: Not the usual 30 but 40 men in the match this year,  there's a brawl that occurs between the new Nexus and the Corre that sets the tone for the night. CM Punk is #1, Daniel Bryan is #2 and this is a ROH fans dream as these two had great matches against each other before coming to WWE. Its a pretty good but drawn out Rumble, Regal gets a nice pop at #5, John Morrison at #7 does a spiderman like move that has to be seen to be believed, once the rest of the new Nexus comes out and dominates for a few minutes it looks like Punk will waltz to Wrestlemania. The return of Booker T gets a massive reaction from the crowd and Striker but he's gone in about a minute, of course John Cena comes out and clears the ring of Nexus and Punk.

Sadly Hornswoggle is in this too and this is where the Rumble gets dumb, as he and Cena team up which as much as I don't like Cena this makes him look bad. It picks back up when people like Sheamus and Wade Barrett enter the fray and the surprise return of Diesel at #32 gets easily the biggest reaction of the night from the crowd and again from Striker himself. However Diesel doesn't last too long but has a face off with Big Show and yet another reaction from Striker. Soon after Alex Riley ends up screwing up and getting eliminated too soon so an audible is called with Miz coming in and throwing Cena over the top to the floor.

The rest of the Rumble is good with Santino entering and getting knocked out of the ring but not over the top, Alberto Del Rio is #38 and has a decent showing, Kane at #40 shockingly doesn't last too long as he's eliminated. The finish is a bit odd as Del Rio appears to have won but Santino comes back in, hits the Cobra Strike but ends up getting tossed over the top so Del Rio is going to Wrestlemania. 9/10 as it wasn't maybe the greatest Rumble ever but it was a lot of fun with surprise returns and some great moments.

4371736,5,B004FZWDS8,"Every once and a while, the WWE puts on a PPV that delivers all the way through.  This event is nothing short of spectacular on all levels.

World Heavyweight Title
Edge vs. Dolph Ziggler w/ Vickie Guerrero:
A very very solid and unique opening contest from the always reliable Edge, and the great up and coming star Ziggler.  The angle is a little stupid, namely Edge will lose the title if he uses the spear, but this match features excellent chemistry and technical display.  Definitely give this one a look; the best title match of the evening!

WWE Title
The Miz w/ Alex Riley vs. Randy Orton:
As much as it pains me to admit, The Miz actually puts on a decent show down here with Orton.  There are a few things wrong with this one, however.  Way too much outside interference and cheap ""storyline pushers"" for me.  But nonetheless, Orton does a brilliant job of selling his character which really helps push The Miz along.  This is the best match these two have together, and easily better than Miz/Cena at Wrestlemania.

Diva's Title
Natalya vs. Michelle McCool vs. Layla vs. Eve Torres:
Although the weakest on the night, this is a pretty good one.  Eve Torres is most definitely the best female worker the WWE has and she wins back the belt in a pretty good ending.

First Ever 40-Man Royal Rumble Match:
Without writing an entire book about this one, I'll just sum it up and say that there was A LOT going on in this year's rumble.  For starters, as expected, the match is reeeaaallllyyyy long.  Not sure of exact times, but I would guess easily 70-80 minutes.
A couple of noteworthy items in this match included the return of Booker T and Diesel, which were both pretty underwhelming.
The rumble also starts and endures a long period where CM Punk's new Nexus dominates, which regretably slows the pace down to a crawl.
The ending, while very unpredictable, was very exciting.  The last twenty minutes or so were enough to save the humdrum and laggish beginning.
All in all, this was one of the better Royal Rumbles I've ever seen.  There was a lot of talent and different faces, with plenty of innovation and charisma.  It was a great way to end a great show.

Pick up a copy of this as soon as you can.  Wrestlemania 27 was a huge letdown, so let this serve as a refresher from the poor event that WM was.  It has a few extras and is available at a pretty good price.  Enjoy !",1311033600,,2389,4.45852534562212
4371737,4,B004FZWDS8,"the first problem i had with this dvd is it says right on the back who won it.
that took some of the exitement out of it.i won't say who in case you don't know but i will say he is the all time worst winner ever.that includes hacksaw jim duggan,vince mc mahon,chris benoit,rey mysterio and edge.
the other matches besides the rumble were ok i guess.for the 24th time in a row the rest of the card was nothing compared to the rumble itself.of course,michael cole ruined the commentery by being the most obnoxious loser on earth.he even gives the miz an interview all during the late stages of the match.he dominates the conversation completely focused on his life partner miz.so the match was NOT getting called at all the whole time miz was there.
with that out of the way,the rest was awesome! there wer even more things that have never happened in a rumble before.one of the coolest things ever seen in a rumble happened.there were 40 men in instead of the usual 30.
matt stryker was hilarious on the mic.there were a lot of unexpected comebacks from places you'd never see coming.a few off the more recent rumbles lacked the huge pizazz of ones from around 2005.this one definately broke the cycle.
  im not really supposed to say much more.i own every rumble there ever was so i say go ahead and buy it.the rumble is awesome.one thing john morrison does will blow your mind!",1302307200,,1378,4.530120481927711
4371738,3,B004FZWDS8,"The road to Wrestlemania has started with the Royal Rumble since 1994.  That was the first year a title shot was granted to the winner.  This year we had:

World Heavyweight Championship
Edge(c) vs. Dolph Ziggler
This started out very slow but it was given plenty of time to develop into a great match!  Many counters and false finishes are the big highlights here.

WWE Championship
The Miz(c) vs. Randy Orton
Pretty good match.  Not the best from either wrestler.  Although, it's hard to tell since Michael Cole is blathering incessantly about Miz.  I'm all for heel announcers but Cole was never good and now he isn't even calling the match.  All kinds of action is happening and us fans have to listen to Cole argue with Lawler and Striker.  Michael has legit heat.  People really hate him but unfortunately stuff like that makes Vince's mouth water.

Fatal 4 way for the Divas Championship
Natalya(c) vs. Michelle McCool vs. Layla vs. Eve Torres
Eve was the ""suprise"" opponent and when her name was announced the crowd went mild.  No one cares about her because she hasn't been present as a real contender.  Laycool has been in nearly every Diva's title match so they are no longer fresh and interesting.  Not to mention they've been a cheap rip-off of the Beautiful People in TNA for years. Natalya defintely deserved better but WWE hasn't cared about women's wrestling for at least 5 years now.

40 Man Royal Rumble Match
Adding 10 guys was a great idea and we got some great surprises!  The middle booking with Nexus running roughshod over everyone was great and surprisingly unpredictable.  The problem is the winner.  Alberto Del Rio is certainly an up and coming star and a fresh face.  However, again, he hasn't been booked or presented as a real credible opponent.  He hasn't done anything except ""injure"" high profile jobbers.

Overall the WWE is trying to do the right thing and make new stars but they have to be in great matches first.  If they wanted Ziggler to be in the main event then 50% of the job is done.",1301443200,,2029,4.653521126760563
4371739,4,B004FZWDS8,"Royal Rumble 2011:

1. Edge(c)vs Dolph Ziggler WH Title: This is a really good match, way better than I thought it would be, it had lots of great action, fast paced and was really easy to sit through, I really enjoyed the ending and I thought it fit perfectly with the match, great performance by both men, especially ziggler who really showed that he is a world title contender, overall a very, very good to great match ***3/4

2. The Miz(c)vs Randy Orton WWE Title: I wasn't a big fan of this match, it was ok, but I don't like miz, his matches always seem to be boring and to drag on, this is no different, orton makes it sorrt of interesting with his fast paced offense, I disliked the ending to this one but I'm sure other people won't mind it, this is not a good wwe title match **1/2

3. 40 Man Royal Rumble Match: I am a massive fan of royal rumble matches, and this one happens to be one of my favourites yet, this is phenomanal! It starts out with the nexus dominating which was great, then cena and that idiot hornswoggle take charge which was funny to see, then the last 20 minutes of this match is amazing, forgot to mention that it was great to see kevin nash and booker t back in the ring. Anyway the last 20 minutes were amazing, I didn't know who was going to win, I was so happy to know the right man won, even though they did a TNA style ending which I didn't really like, anyway this match was awesome and is a match that you cant miss ****3/4

Match of the Night: 40 Man Royal Rumble
Worst Match of the Night: Miz vs Orton
Moment of Night: Booker T and Keving Nash returned for the royal rumble match

Overall PPV: 8/10

Hard to rate the overall show because there were only 3 matches on the card apart from the divas match but I don't watch divas matches because they are awful and a waste of time.",1301443200,,1820,4.170940170940171

Dolph Ziggler vs Edge(c)
This match starts out pretty slow and is til about midway when the match starts to heat up and has a tremendous second half. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Edge can not use the spear here as it is banned which makes him think alot more creatively.
(****)

2. WWE Championship
Randy Orton vs The Miz(c)
This is probably their worst match together. I would even say that Miz's cash in was better than this. The match is way to long and drags. These to just did not have chemistry together. The last few minutes is fine but doesnt save the match.
(**1/4)

3. Divas Championship
Laycool vs Eve vs Natalya(c)
This match was like every divas match. Not Noteworthy

4. The Royal Rumble Match
This is probably a Top 5 Royal Rumble. It is action-packed with plenty of surprises. The ending is kind of lame but there is a shocker that i have never seen til this rumble.

ROYAL RUMBLE 2011

This was the biggest Rumble ever with 10 additional wrestlers added to the match making 40 instead of 30. Also there are some great matches before the Rumble so this ended up being one of the best Rumble's ever.

spoilers

1.[WORLD TITLE]EDGE VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-this year's event started out right with an excellent World Heavyweight Title match between two of Smackdown's best. The match is really good Dolph really letting into Edge for a good portion of the match. Of course thanks to Vickie as I am sure you know Edge could not use the spear. And of course that did not stop him from using it when the ref was down. Afterwards he ""gives a shoutout"" to Christian by using his finisher.

2.[WWE TITLE]THE MIZ VS RANDY ORTON-my favorite match from the non Rumble matches probably because I love The Miz. This is an excellent match that sees Orton take to Miz until Miz gets some help from Alex Riley. Still even after that the macth is back and forth the entire time until the New Nexus inteferes. C M Punk makes Orton Go 2 Sleep and my boy Miz is still the champ and still awesome.

3.[4 WAY DIVAS TITLE MATCH]NATALYA VS LAYLA VS MICHELLE MCCOOL VS EVE-now I have to say that this is not as bad as some people say, I actually kinda liked the match. It had some good moments and the finish was pretty good. The only thing I don't like is that Natalya looses the title. Still it was a decent match but not the best on the card obviously.

4. ROYAL RUMBLE-this was of course as I am sure you know the biggest Rumble ever with 40 not 30 participants. Of course if you have read any other reviews you know the highlights [there are many], like the Nexus/Corre brawl or the returns of Booker T and Diesel [Kevin Nash]. There are many others I am sure you have heard of like the Spiderman moment, the Hornswoggle moments, Chavo, surprise eliminations and of course our winner Alberto Del Rio. This was with out a doubt one of the best Rumble's in history, in fact it reminded me of the old ones, just pure fun. I wanted Punk or Barret to win this match so bad.

The special features include an interview with Eve, Del Rio's Rumble celebration from the next night on Raw as well as the ENTIRE episode of Raw before the Royal Rumble. This really was one of the best or should I say the most fun Rumble events in a while.",1299801600,2,2334,4.339449541284404

4371743,4,B004FZWDS8,"Yes, there were only 3 matches besides the Rumble and one was a women's match. But the opener (Dolph Ziggler vs Edge) is an early contender for match of the year. Randy Orton vs The Miz was pretty good too.

As far as the Rumble itself, the only part that was boring was when Nexus dominated for about 10 minutes straight. The returns of Booker T and Diesel were fantastic and great to see.
