8137462,2,B000H7LZ9Q,"Paul Muni (1895-1967) stars as an immigrant coal miner mixed up in a labor dispute in the mid-1930s. Muni was nominated for an Oscar in his very first film, The Valiant in 1929, and 6 more times - I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936), The Life of Emile Zola (1937), The Last Angry Man (1959), and this film. To be nominated 6 times over a period of 30 years is remarkable (and unmatched) itself, but this achievement is all the more meaningful when you realize that Muni made only 21 films, and furthermore, he wasn't nominated for Scarface (1932) or The Good Earth (1937) in which his performances were also exceptional.

The film from Warner Brothers was very controversial at the time, showing the illegal activities on both sides. The film was banned in several states where coal mining was prevalent. It was based on a real incident in 1929 when a coal miner was beaten to death by police.

Barton MacLane (1902-69) plays a gangster, his usual role in the 30s. MacLane is best remembered as the General from TVs I Dream of Jeannie (1965-70). MacLane was a favorite opposite Bogart  in The Maltese Falcon, San Quentin, High Sierra, All Through the Night, and Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

Diminutive John Qualen (1899-1987) made nearly 200 films, 9 of them directed by John Ford and 4 with Wayne but not Ford. My favorite John Qualen role was as Lars in ""The Searchers"" (1956). In this film he plays a miner and Munis friend.

Versatile J. Carrol Naish plays a villain  who tries to split the union. Naish was twice nominated for an Oscar (Sahara in 1941, A Medal for Benny in 1946). He was extremely versatile and could play an Indian (The Whirlwind), a Russian (British Agent), an Arab (The Crusades), an Asian (The Hatchet Man) and a Latino (The Kid from Spain).

Look for Tully Marshall, Mae Marsh, Akim Tamiroff, and Ward Bond among the character actors.

Director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962) is best known for his 7 films with Errol Flynn. He was nominated for an Oscar for their first collaboration (Captain Blood, 1935), and received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney - Angels with Dirty Faces(1938) and Yankee Doddle Dandy (1941) - and one win for a film with Bogart (Casablanca, 1942). Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself  he once declared The next time I want an idiot to do this, Ill do it myself.

1935 was a good year for films. Mutiny on the Bounty and The Informer were box office and Oscar winners. Other top 10 grossing films included Gable and Harlow in China Seas, Flynn and de Havilland in Captain Blood, Shirley Temple in The Littlest Rebel and Curly Top, and Greta Garbo in Anna Karenina. Other notable films released that year included Alice Adams with Hepburn, The 39 Steps, The Bride of Frankenstein, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities, Les Miserables, Top Hat, and A Night at the Opera. In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released Triumph of the Will.

The NY Times called the film a trenchant contribution to the sociological drama and a stirring tale of industrial war in the coal fields. They praised Muni and Curtiz and added the photoplay achieves a melodramatic vigor and an air of cumulative power which is rare in the Hollywood cinema. By all odds, ""Black Fury"" is the most notable American experiment in social drama since ""Our Daily Bread.""

Variety said There are times when the footage is slow and Paul Munis Polish brogue too thick but in the main the general result is arresting.

Bottom line  an interesting film marred by the inability to understand Munis heavy accent, and the simplistic cause for the unions woes.",1409616000,3,3619,4.678740157480315

8137465,1,B000H7LZ9Q,"I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Paul Muni,however I found this movie to be a big disapointment. The one hurdle i couldn't get past was his accent. I know he is playing an immigrant and i suppose the director thought it an important aspect of the story,however I found it quiet annoying and very hard to understand the dialogue. The storyline itself was somewhat thin and drawnout,hardly worth suffering through Muni's inaudible accent. I really wanted to like this movie,as I had found it by accident and was anxious to enjoy a new found gem from the past. If you would like to see Paul Muni at his best ,I would recommend the following films,""I am a fugitive from a chain gang"" ""The good earth"" ""Angel on my shoulder"" and ""Scarface"".",1313366400,4,748,4.507352941176471
