I applaud Morehouse for setting laudable standards in all aspects of life, and providing the encouragement and structure to help young men achieve beyond their wildest dreams.",1282521600,,322,5.313725490196078
7876261,5,6304700040,My son was a student at Morehouse when this documentary was filmed and can be seen in the video. 14 years later my son remembers his years at Morehouse as some of the most important in his life and has formed many lifelong relationships from his years there. I only wish it were released in DVD form. It would make a great gift.,1180742400,2,328,4.222222222222222
7876262,4,6304700040,"Back in 1995, as an avid watcher of PBS, I taped this program, along with The Gandy Dancers, which was about those brethern who worked the rail lines way back in the day. Who would have thought over 10 years later, I would be a student at Dear Old Morehouse?

As a graduation gift to a friend, I ordered this tape and he has enjoyed it immensely. As a participant on the popular college network, Facebook.com, I have had requests to make copies of this invaluable documentary by Spencer Tolliver.

It's too bad that the bookstore doesn't carry this!

Going through New Student Orientation and Freshmen Week are memories I will cherish forever, and as a tutor and new RA, I will have my residents watch this film as well...

This is a must have for your collection!",1146528000,4,764,4.5144927536231885
7876263,4,6304700040,"As a current student at Morehouse College, I can tell you that this video is a much needed resourse into the everyday workings of Morehouse College.  As you may know Morehouse is the only all male, Black, four year institution in the world.  You have heard stories for years about Morehouse and her sons-- get this video and understand it for yourself.",1071273600,4,352,4.661290322580645
