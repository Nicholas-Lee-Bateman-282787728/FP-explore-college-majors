486022,4,6302610583,"This movie glimpses into almost everyone's high school days. A time of self awareness and emotions like love, anger, jealousy and that yearning to belong, to be cool. Also one of recklessness. These strong feelings and actions are brought to the forefront by three close friend actors.  Actor Russell Crowe displays his burgeoning talent with his one-time girlfriend Danielle Spencer and best friend Robert Mammone, who he will later star with in ""Heaven's Burning.""  This film is simple but powerful in its simplicity. Being a teenager is not easy and the actors give a credible performance using their talent and their youth itself to portray this difficult age.  ""The Crossing"" is a faithfull reflection about young passions and first love.",999302400,18,743,5.175
486023,4,6302610583,Only reason to get this movie is because of Russell.  He is great in his first film role.  Did not need the nudity in this.  Story could have been better.,991785600,4,154,4.066666666666666
486024,1,6302610583,"Sappy melodrama and heavy-handed symbolism (come on, racing for the *railroad crossing*?  Yeah, okay, we got it) aside, this film simply isn't worth your time.  It doesn't quite fall into the ""Well, that's two hours of my life I will never get back"" catagory, but it comes close.  The story is one that everyone has seen before: guy leaves girl for the big city, then comes back; girl doesn't really want guy (after having hooked up with his best friend), but thinks she may want the big city and the best way to get it is with guy.  Sometimes new faces can make old material work, but unfortunately, this isn't one of those times.  The actors really do the best they can with the material given, but it simply doesn't work.",979430400,5,724,4.4961832061068705
486025,5,6302610583,"I thought Russell Crowe was amazing in this movie. He really got in touch with his emotional side. His character Johnny was different from other characters he had done in the past and present like SID 6.7 or Bud White.  Nevertheless, Russell Crowe shines in every role he plays because he brings  his own power and charisma with a wonderful smile or a stern look. I rate  this movie highly especially for those who are looking for a movie that  concentrates on the characters instead of special effects. This movie is  ""SIMPLE BUT AMAZING"".",952905600,27,540,4.702127659574468
486061,5,6302610583,"I ordered the movie ""The Crossing"" from Amazon.  It arrived just a few days later, the order was easy and fast.  ""The Crossing"" is supposedly the first fairly big movie Russell Crowe made.  The woman starring with him was Danielle Spencer, who now happens to be his wife, after all those years. I collect Russell Crowe movies and I've been able to find all the movies I've wanted with Amazon.",1334016000,,392,4.571428571428571
486062,4,6302610583,"It was great to finally get The Crossing have been trying for ages in Australia to obtain this dvd but unfortunately not available like many of Russell Crowes movies .
Was worth waiting for good movie in good condition and arrived earlier than expected.",1296604800,,253,4.7727272727272725
486063,3,6302610583,"Just when you think a retro movie is predictable the end throws you a curve.
Russell Crowe fans will want to see it out of curiousity. Crowe met his now wife Danielle Spencer who co-stars with him in this movie. While actors did a good job it is still just an average movie.",1277510400,,274,4.188679245283019
486064,3,6302610583,"Having watched the real-life coverage of the wedding of Danielle Spencer and Russell Crowe, I must say that I felt truly happy for them both, and I wish them success at their marriage.
 As for the movie that introduced the couple, it's rather bland, but then this is probably a realistic view of life in a small Australian town.
 It's rather hard to place the exact year in which the story takes place but it appears to be around 1965 when men like the stylish looking Robert Mammone would have grown their hair out a bit more. Mammone, is very handsome with his chiseled and intense looking features. As the potential love interest and rival of Russell Crowe, whose emotions range from staid to explosive, Mammone is strikingly sophisticated.
 As the center of the love triangle, Spencer is pretty staid at times. But she is convincing as the country girl who has trouble making the heady decision awaiting her.
 The scenes between the originally established couple are racy, but considering the real-life romance of the two leads, a sign of things to come.
 We see the family lives of the three main characters and of those around them. Most of the supporting players appear frustrated with their lives, and lamenting past mistakes, especially the elders in the story, whereas the young boldly take chances and do what they must to make their lives more exciting and distinguished.
 The story ends with the heroine Meg trying to stop the feud between her rival suitors, and a frightening and fateful accident that will alter certain choices that had to be made.
 This movie is highly reflective of the youthful culture it depicts, and the youth and inexperience of the actors is self evident. But in the years since, viewers have seen them improve.",1057276800,5,1750,4.794019933554817
486065,2,6302610583,"We have become accustomed to viewing Russell Crowe films with a certain expectation of good, quality acting.  And in this case his portrayal of a young in love, small town boy was on target.  But the rest of the cast make this film unbearable to watch.
Robert Mammone as Crowe's rival does a decent job, but Danielle Spencer as the object of both their affections, falls flat on her face.  In the end she hasn't convinced anyone that she has the capibility to love anyone.  She comes off as selfish and cold.
I really hated this movie.",1037664000,4,535,4.484536082474227
486066,4,6302610583,"Great little film, Good performances by all, first look a Mr. Crowe as a younster....A good preview of what was to come from this amazing actor.",1031184000,2,144,4.576923076923077
486067,4,6302610583,"I purchased this film based on some other reviews and a desire to see a young Russel Crowe (25 years old) in action.  I think Russel's brillance as an actor is readily apparent even in this early movie.  When I was twelve years old I saw a movie entitled  To Kill A Mocking Bird with Gregary Peck.  At one point his character explains to his daughter that you never know what someone's joys and pains are until you walk in their skin.  I think Russel has the ability to become the person he is portraying even for a moment which provides everyone who watches the ability to walk in the character's skin.  I thoroughly enjoyed this little master piece.  It was my first Australian film, and I have viewed it several times. It has become one of my favorite home owned films. The musical score is also really good.  Other performances are also excellent.",1022544000,,851,4.48051948051948
486068,4,6302610583,"If you wonder who he was, then see this one first. Russell Crowe's first substantial role - as a young man in love with the even younger Danielle Spencer, in a small town Australian drama that's simple,touching and unglamourized -which adds to its effect. Russell, as the good-hearted local lad, is trying to keep his girl whose first love has moved on to the city and then without warning returns for her. Which is about where we enter. Who will she choose or betray; whose life will she decide she can abide? We are of course rooting for Russell. This film will remind you of Rebel Without A Cause. It's a lovely little piece, pretty undemanding of the viewer (who won't find a Bud White here), yet surprisingly engaging, and just a glimpse into this great talent.",1020470400,4,766,4.598540145985401
486069,5,6302610583,"A great little movie.  The images may be a bit heavy-handed but contribute to the story's portrayal of how the 3 main characters work their way through a pivotal day.  We are skillfully drawn in to their emotional turmoil as they respond to feelings of loyalty, commitment and responsibility.  Robert Mammone is beautiful, Danielle Spencer is enigmatic, and Russell Crowe is a wonderfully frustrated & confused young man in love.  Not to be missed!",1019606400,4,448,5.013513513513513

7828022,4,6302610583,"This is a good, if predictable, story of two young men who love the same woman in a small town in Australia in the 1950s.  Crowe and his future wife, Danielle Spencer, do a nice job together as two of the people involved in this love triangle.  Some of the music is supposed to be 50s-ish but sounds a bit too modern.",1360540800,,317,4.096774193548387
