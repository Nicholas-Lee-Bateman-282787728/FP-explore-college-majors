527613,4,6302989523,"Juliette Lewis is in one of her finer roles in this wonderful movie.  Lewis plays a teenage catholic school girl who falls in love with a boy from the other side of the tracks. They meet in a bowling alley, which is  the focal point in the movie. Lots of memorable performances, including C.  Thomas Howell as Rick, the guy that Cheryl(Lewis) falls in love with, and  the debut of Eliza Dushku, who would later be in the movie True Lies,  playing a 10 year old girl witnessing the love between them.  A great cast  of characters, this movie delivers the goods and then some!",949708800,,574,4.40952380952381

527771,5,6302989523,"I have fond memories of watching this as a 9 year old kid. But years go by and I forget the name of it and even who played in it. I kept thinking it was ""About Last Night"" but kept kitting a dead end road when I tried to look it up and realized that was a Demi Moore movie. Then I happened to click on an article where Eliza Dushku (Alice) happens to post a picture of herself with Brad Pitt (who was Juliette Lewis' boyfriend at the time) on the set of this movie. I was floored! I finally had the name of the movie and the leading actors and I could FINALLY look for the movie! I came straight here and looked it up and saw it on Amazon Video and I am watching it for the first time in over 20 years now. I am falling in love all over again. I even got excited watching a couple of scenes that I remember (like the breast cream scene and the frog scene) but could never recall what movie they were from. I am sooooo glad I happened to click on that article and that it lead me to be able to watch one of my old faves again after all this time! Nicely made movie!

527811,4,6302989523,"1961: JFK was in the White House,the ""Red Scare"" was on everyone's lips,Rock 'n' roll was on the transistors, The Beatles had not invaded from Britain yet and the country was hitting puberty and change,big change was in the air!

THAT NIGHT,which comes from the delightful Alice MacDermott novel views the country and all of it's pending metamorphosis through the eyes of ten year old Alice;she seems primed for the big changes that are about to occur in her as she lives vicariously through the exotic and near iconic 17 year old Sheryl. Sheryl (Juliette Lewis) has grown up in the perfect Catholic home,but she has fallen for a ""greaser"" (C.Thomas Howell).Alice (Eliza Dusku)becomes enamoured with the love affair and the ensuing drama that this ""forbidden"" relationship brings upon the fine people of this post 1950's suburban community.

THAT NIGHT recreates this time of innocence in American life when black and white was clearly defined;but when true love steps in,convention is rocked to it's foundation. For those of us who grew up in this Era,we will understand the nature of the story all too well and will wax nostalgically to the sounds of the time. The taboos of the time have largely disappeared from progressive society,but the story is ageless about the intense and nonsensical power of ""first love."" It is a coming of age story like many others before and after it, but there is a certain sweetness and gentleness that pervades this film. Best described,THAT NIGHT is a ten year old's rendering of ROMEO AND JULIET.",1189728000,2,1533,4.937984496124031
527812,4,6302989523,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT! IT TELLS ABOUT ALOT OF IMPORTANT VIEWS. I LIKE WATCHING IT 2 A YEAR. BUT, I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO THIS MOVIE. A LITTLE YOUNG ROMANCE, WITH A NEIGHBOOR RIVAL!!",1127692800,2,197,4.351351351351352
527813,3,6302989523,"This movie is cute, but you probably don't want to buy it unless

1) You're a teenage girl. Not saying that's a bad thing, mind you.

2) You're a big fan of this genre (coming of age, set in the late 50s-early 60s), or a Juliette Lewis fan.

Basic plot(s): 10-year old Ally is kind of a dork. Her friends are mean to her, and the neighborhood boys tease her, too. Ally lives across the street from teenage Catholic school girl Sheryl(Juliette Lewis). Ally idolizes Sheryl from afar, because she thinks she is so cool. Meanwhile Sheryl meets a ""bad boy"" and falls in love with him. It's a predictable story that goes back and forth between Ally and Sheryl, until they become friends.

It's not a terrible movie, just not the kind of movie you would watch more than once unless like I said, you're a young girl. Story has been done a million times. The acting is okay, but I personally have seen Juliette Lewis do better, a C. Thomas Howell isn't very good, actually. Both look way too old to be playing teenagers, but that's usually how it is. There is nothing spectacular about the score or the directing or anything like that.",1119657600,3,1127,4.456310679611651
527814,5,6302989523,"This movie use to be on t.v. when i was about 12 and I loved watching it. Juliette Lewis, who has been in many movies, is a great actress and is a bit forgotto at times, not to mention she lives in my town. I was driving with my dad one day and i looked to my right and there she was in her car at a traffic stop drinking a starbucks frappacinno and then she drove into this gated neighborhood where the richie's live. But anyway, young eliza dushku plays the little girl in this movie that looks up to lewis, and in such different times, lewis and howell are basically the talk of the town and neighborhood full of gossip and envy, and anger. It takes place in the 50's i believe and after being in the outsiders, once again c thomas howell is still in that time in this drama. It is a little depressing at times, because howell is obviously misunderstood as being a no good punk kid who knocks up his girlfriend and ditches her when that isn't the case at all and no one understands that they are in fact in love but they both realize that their youth is the main obsticle to have a successful long lasting life together raising their child. I don't think they have this movie for rent anymore anywhere. But it has always been underrated. It's a good example of teen pregnancy and i think that parents should watch it with their kids if they or out of control or just for entertainment.",1118448000,3,1388,4.241509433962264

The story takes place in the summer of 1961 and follows a 10 year old girl Alice Bloom who idolizes her 17 year old neighbor Cheryl O' Connor across the street. She listens to the songs she listens too and she wears the same perfume she does.

Cheryl has a close relationship with her father until he dies suddenly and she is upset. Her mother is overprotective and when she can't that, she goes to the bowling alley to return the shoes she left when her father died, she meets Rick and they get to talking about life and death of her father and why it had to happen. There she does a record to reveal her feelings of that day and he tells her to bury it like time capsule and dig it up in 50 years. He walks her home and they kiss,and from that night on they were inseparable. Meanwhile Alice is trying to establish a realtionship with her dad who always away on business, plus the parents are coping with a death of a son and the father wants the mother to keep trying to have a baby and the mother feels she's being rushed into it.

Well one night Rick and Cheryl make love and she gets pregnant. When her mother finds out, she is furious and she sends her to a home for unwed mothers. Alice goes so far to run away to get Rick and Cheryl together so they can be together before things change. Rick proposes to her and sas he'll to everything to provide for her and the baby. Finally Alice is happy to see them together 1 last time before she boards the bus home and she reunites with her parents. In time she receives a post card from both of them from Utah and things are fine.

I really can watch it over and over. It's such a good movie for a group of gals to get nice and cozy on the couch with the box of tissues because it was a real tear jerker for me.
I loved the music but I just can't seem to find the soundtrack anywhere...my favorite song is ""Ruler of My Heart"". If anyone knows who sings that song or how to get the soundtrack please let me know!",1027987200,5,431,3.853932584269663

527840,5,6302989523,"I am a young businessman, who rarely has time to watch old films etc. I say old films, because I amguilty of watching the latest films at the movies etc. I first saw this film probably in 1997 by chance while I was working. I thought it was quite a good film but nothing more( I WAS working @ the time!). I then saw it again about a year ago when it was on the TV, and I cant quite put my finger on it, but it moved me. I think it was that teen-angst, while remaining so true to real life that got me. Not like any of your modern TV shows, this movie is amazingly true to life. It is a well-written story, amazing cast, and extremely well directed. Although its not a huge action packed film, if you are ever spending a night in with your partner for a quiet evening, this is a film i wouldn't reccomend you miss!!!!",998438400,9,816,4.012269938650307
527841,5,6302989523,"The Funny thing is that when I first watched this movie I was Eliza Dushku's age. I realted to her because of her innocence and her seeing Juliette Lewis go into the relationship with Howell and watching them make their mistakes and idolizing Lewis. But now I am 16 and I relate to Juliette Lewis now beacsue of my expersiences and my age now. Later on in life when I watch this movie again I will start relating to the mothers that play cards and chit chat about their problems. This movie can relate to anyone and the dancing, clothes and music are wonderful!!! It take splace in 1961 in Long Island New York. The movie makes you smile, there's no doubt about it. It has been my favortie since I was a little girl and it is still my favorite now at 16. Go see it, you won't regret it. ~~MURI~~",995673600,2,795,4.2368421052631575
527842,5,6302989523,"That Night has been my favorite movie ever since the day i saw it.  Julliette Lewis puts on an amazing performance in this film about teen romance and the struggles of being a teenager.  The movie takes place back in the 1950's which allows for some great music and amazing cars.  Rick (a bowling alley manager) and Cheryl (a catholic girl who proves to be daddys little girl) fall in love and face many problems along their romance.  A young girl called Allie (Dushuk) watches with bright eyes the ups and downs of Rick and Cheryl's realtionship and fights till the end for both of them.  My favorite scene has to be dancing at the beach.  And i will always remember allie saying: ""I thought if either of my parents died, i'd die too....that if they stopped breathing they'd draw me back inside......like they once told me they kissed each other and breathed me into life...."" Its SOOOOOOOOO worth the watch.",982627200,6,909,4.614906832298137
527843,5,6302989523,"I bought this a few days ago and so far I've watched it with my eleven year old daughter 3 times, and she has invited a half dozen freinds over, all of whom love it. Having grown up in the 50's I find this a masterpiece.  Finally I got to show my daughter a real 1949 Mercury, my absolutely  favorite all-time car! One of Juliette Lewis' best roles and Elisa Dushku,  the actress who plays 10 year old Allie is magical. There is a dancing  scene near the pier with C. Thomas Howell, Christy's punk boyfriend Ricky,  that makes me cry every time. The birthday party is heartbreaking as well,  my daughter had to ask how you play spin-the-bottle. The set design were  masterful,with stop frame I recognize hundreds of things from my youth. The  movie is an absolute work of genius!",964742400,14,779,4.436619718309859
