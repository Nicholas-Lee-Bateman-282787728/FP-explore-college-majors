2228741,5,B0007PALOI,"Director Sam Fuller's FORTY GUNS is a rather baroque and extravagant Western that is pure energy and emotion. Almost impossible to follow, the story really doesn't matter. The emotional impact on the viewer of the sensational characters and events is Fuller's focus here with his pulp perspective. Gunslinger turned marshal Barry Sullivan confronts a matriarchal Barbara Stanwyck who rules the Arizona Territory with her army of forty guns. The dinner sequence at the sprawling table is an example of Fuller's offbeat sense of the dramatic. Barry Sullivan is excellent as the provoked marshal who continually avoids having to use his gun to kill. This film was written, produced and directed by Sam Fuller in Cinemascope, strikingly photographed by Academy Award winning cinematographer Joseph Biroc, as a major production for Twentieth Century Fox.",1128729600,,849,5.4393939393939394
2228742,4,B0007PALOI,"Hell and High Water  was one of 20th Century Fox's earliest experiments with CinemaScope, widescreen movies that were Hollywood's attempt to lure people away from their TV sets and back into the theatres by giving them something they couldn't get staying home. Sam Fuller did such a good job with this format that he used it again on Forty Guns, a hard-hitting western as only he could make.

Right from the opening scene, Fuller presents an impressive, expansive vista: a wide open plain with a lone horse and carriage. There is a sudden, jarring cut to a close-up of many horse hooves thundering across the plain. It is 40 men on horseback being led by landowner Jessica Drummond (Stanwyck), clad all in black. They head straight for the men and their carriage only to go flying past them, surrounding them on all sides with no intention of slowing down. And then they're gone. Welcome to a Sam Fuller western.

Fuller uses every opportunity to show off the widescreen format while employing extensive use of close-ups and one of the longest tracking shots ever done at Fox's studio at that time. Forty Guns is one of the most dynamic westerns ever made and this is due to Fuller's infectious energy as reflected in his pulpy prose and kinetic camerawork. It's not enough to say that they don't make westerns like this anymore - they just don't make movies like this anymore.",1118102400,12,1377,4.729166666666667
2228743,5,B0007PALOI,"Movie: *****  DVD Transfer: ****1/2  Extras: ****

Barbara Stanwyck is rougher than rawhide as Jessica Drummond, the high-riding ""Woman With a Whip"" (the film's pre-production title) in writer-producer-director Sam Fuller's movie about the female ruler of rugged Cochise County, Arizona.  Armed with determination, wiles, and a savage lash, Drummond has firm control over the territory ... and she's backed up by a gang of forty sharp-shooting killers who follow her orders without question.  Everything's going her way until a former gunslinger turned marshal (Barry Sullivan) arrives with his two brothers and begins to chip away at Drummond's power by attempting to restore law and order to the territory.  Soon enough the lady and the lawman are engaged in a deadly battle of equals that will eventually engulf the entire community.

It's hard to believe that ""Forty Guns"" proved to be Stanwyck's last big screen appearance for five long years, a period in which she didn't make films because, in her own words, ""no one asked me.""  Her performance is simply astonishing, and superbly nuanced: her voice and physical bearing communicate all too clearly that Jessica is not a woman to be trifled with.  Stanwyck's triumph is even more complete when one realizes that the fifty-year-old actress performed all her own stunts in the film --- including being dragged by a horse during a harrowing tornado sequence!  The rest of the cast is excellent throughout: Sullivan pulls off the difficult task of matching Stanwyck's energy without attempting to steal scenes; and nice work is also turned in by supporting players Gene Barry, John Ericson, and Dean Jagger.  However, this is Stanwyck's movie all the way; her presence infuses every scene, even when she's off-camera.

The DVD presentation of this film is a credit to 20th Century-Fox Home Video.  Both widescreen (Cinemascope) and pan-and-scan versions are included on the disc, and although it's not mentioned on the packaging, the DVD also includes the film's Original Theatrical Trailer.  Picture and sound quality are superb throughout ... even the trailer is beautifully transferred.  Overall, this is a magnificent release of a rarely screened film, enthusiastically recommended for fans of Samuel Fuller, Barbara Stanwyck, and the Western genre.",1116892800,48,2306,5.31404958677686
2228744,5,B0007PALOI,"The imminent release of this 1957 DVD is well worth waiting for especially in showing the fim in its original widescreen format. FORTY GUNS is a creative Fuller reworking of the western genre turning stereotypes on their heads, revealing the raw emotionalism and insecurity affecting various characters, and containing brilliant examples of crane and tracking shots representing key elements of this cinematic genius.

  FORRTY GUNS has received good critical comment in the past. But what is most notable in this film is the reworking of previous  westerns such as THE GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K CORRAL and THE FURIES into a Fulleresque cinematic battleground. The Bonnell brothers (led by Barry Sullivan now reluctant to kill) are reworked versions of the Earpps while Barbara Stanwyck's sexually assertive Jessica Drummond is Fuller's masculinized version of Vance Jeffords from Anthony Mann's THE FURIES and her previous ""Cattle Queen of Montana."" Stanwyck, of course, personified the strong woman on screen in the pre-feminist era and this is one of her best performances. In this film, all conventions are overturned resulting in one of the most iconoclastic endings ever to appear in a Western. I will not spoil it for those who have not seen it but merely point out that Fuller directs the studio's ""official climax"" in a deliberately unbelievable manner. This is one of the best westerns of its kind directed by one of the major artists of Hollywood cinema. Cliches are absent and Stanwyck's character represents one of the most amazing inversions of classical Hollywood gender stereotypes ever to appear outside ""film noir.""

 Companies should now follow Criterion's DVD release of PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET (1952)by releasing restored widescreen versions of Fuller's early Vietnam War entry CHINA GATE (1957) and MERRILL'S MARAUDERS (1961). In this current age of Hollywood creative bankruptcy, a return to the legacy of one of its greatest exponents is long overdue.",1116115200,24,1969,5.274760383386582

Silly script, odd pacing, jumping from one thing to another with no continuity at all.  Needless to say a big disappointment.

2228804,5,B0007PALOI,"If you're a Stanwyck fan, ""Forty Guns"" should be right alongside ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" in your DVD collection. I saw it decades ago at an independent theatre specializing in Hollywood classic movies. I never forgot how much it impressed me, with its stark cinematography, complex storyline, and sheer intensity. The DVD is well-made and the wide-screen format is amazing, beautifully utilized by Sam Fuller.

Others have given a full synopsis of this film so there's no need for me to add to it.

Prior to seeing this film I was only familiar with Barry Sullivan as the star of the old TV western, ""The Tall Man"", where Sullivan played Pat Garrett opposite Clu Gulager as Billy the Kid. Sullivan's such a low-key actor, he really comes across much better on TV than on the big screen - but he plays very well against Stanwyck's patented 'tough girl' character.

Stanwyck and Sullivan had partnered in two previous movies: the 1953 film noir ""Jeopardy"" and the Western ""The Maverick Queen"" by director Joseph Kane in 1956. If you have any doubts about how masterfully director Sam Fuller handled ""Forty Guns"", you have only to watch ""The Maverick Queen"", which is so much less interesting a movie with the same basic characters.",1324252800,2,1240,4.839622641509434
2228805,4,B0007PALOI,"In 1880's Cochise County, Arizona, Jessica Drumond (Barbara Stanwyck) is the queen.  In fact, she doesn't just run the county, she exercises power at the Territorial level as well.  Having begun from what her father built, she now races about the countryside on a white stallion, trailed by a band of 40 hired guns who obey her every order.  Then U.S. Marshal Griff Bonnell (Barry Sullivan) arrives, accompanied by his brother and ""second gun"" Wes (Gene Barry) and their kid brother Chico (Robert Dix), whom they've promised to send off to California to join their parents--over the objections of Chico, who doesn't want to be a farmer; he wants to be Griff's third gun.  Bonnell's old friend, Marshal John Chisum (Hank Worden), has recently gained the enmity of Jessica's kid brother Brockie (John Ericson), and when Bonnell arrests the young man, he makes a bad enemy.  Yet Jessica, who ""needs a strong man to carry out her orders,"" finds herself deeply attracted to Bonnell, even after he serves a warrant on one of her men.  Brockie, meanwhile, has been found innocent and released, but he still resents the Bonnells, and when he kills Wes on his wedding day, the stage is set for everyone's ruin.

This is said to be a heavily sexualized Western, but I didn't find it so; sexual tension there certainly is, but nothing overt (after all, this was 1957).  What it certainly is, is Stanwyck in her defintive ""tough-broad"" sort of role, a woman who is respected, obeyed, and even worshipped and feared by men who are pretty tough themselves.  Beside her the soft-spoken Bonnells (probably loosely based on Wyatt Earp and his brothers) seem almost boyish, yet they do their jobs quietly and well.  I did think the ending was a bit of a cop-out, but it's probably the sort of thing you should expect from a movie made at a time when women's lib still lay well in the future and the popular belief was that every woman should accept a designated, traditional role rather than trying to outdo the men at their own game.",1304640000,,2016,4.717948717948718
2228806,4,B0007PALOI,"It is unsual to have a lady as the lead actress of a western movie, but I was not disappointed. The plot was simple, but the movie still moves quickly. Barbara Stanwyck played well in this movie.

Another Barbara Stanwyck Western is ""The Furies"". Similar style, made to suit Stanwyck. She played both sharp ladies.

Good to have a change.",1249948800,2,338,4.616666666666666
2228807,4,B0007PALOI,"You gotta love Samuel Fuller.  Almost all his movies have some sort of dominatrix business going on and this one is no exception.  Barbara Stanwyck plays a woman who rides a white horse, packs a whip, and usually travels at top speed at the head of a posse of 40 cowboys, also moving at a gallop.  The scene where they are all seated at a meal in her house looked like a demented Snow White and the seven dwarves.  I think they all had their hats on, even, but I'm not sure I'm remembering that right.

Some of the other reviewers mention that Stanwyck did her own stunts in this movie--I wondered about that.  In one of the first scenes where she is galloping and the camera is following her, I couldn't imagine how they found a stunt double who looked that much like her...guess they didn't.

Some of the weirdness was just plain laughable to me, like the guy who walks around with a guitar singing about the ""High Riding Woman with a Whip.""  Too funny!",1226016000,,955,4.3559322033898304
2228808,5,B0007PALOI,"***** 1957. Written, produced and directed by Samuel Fuller. Griff Bonnell and his two brothers arrive in Cochise county, a land ruled by Jessica Drummond and the forty gunmen who work for her. This brilliant movie is one of the high points of Samuel Fuller's filmography. Certain scenes with their explicit sadism announce the wave of the spaghetti westerns, scenes like the arrival of the twister or Wes Bonnell's funeral are even already part of Movie History. If you own a multizone DVD player, you should buy at Amazon.fr the zone 2 collector edition of FORTY GUNS.

2228809,4,B0007PALOI,"If you've never seen this film, I think you'll find it a bit different from most classic westerns. It's really more of a film noir, I thought, and I liked that angle. I say ""film noir"" because of feel. This western had stark black-and-white photography with tons of shadows and it had a dramatic scene near the end that was very noir-ish. I was very impressed with the ending, and that's all I will say as to not spoil it for others.

The DVD has the option of fullscreen or widescreen. Please consider the latter, because that is how it was presented: in ""cinemascope,"" and you'll want to see photographer Joseph Birac's work in all its glory.  This looks great!.

All the characters are pretty interesting. Barbara Stanwyck fans will be disappointed at her screen time. She is getting headlines here on this page, but she is not the leading character. To repeat, this is an odd story. I mean, how often does one see a tornado in the middle of a western movie? Some of the lines in here were quite profound, too, and some were uttered really stupidly. It's a curiosity piece, that's for sure.....but definitely worth watching if good photography and odd characters interest you.",1188950400,,1179,4.658653846153846
2228810,5,B0007PALOI,"Occasionally some of the great noir directors of the 40's and 50's like Fuller, nicholas ray, and billy wilder (wilder made a film in pretty much every genre) would make a genre film like a western.. When they did the results were very interesting as they used the same sorts of techniques in these films as they used in their other movies..
The sexual and psychological tensions of such movies like this one and johnny guitar would set them apart from your typical john wayne style western.. and subsequently they are often embraced by a more varied audience..
40 guns is shot in painfully beautiful black and white cinema scope with a stylized technique which often takes very interesting angles on the action taking place in the scene.. The acting and dialogue is pretty typical for a fuller movie - deliberately over the top sometimes.. and the music which is so deliberately western it seems almost like a parody..
All these qualities make it very enjoyable and at times surprising to watch a movie in a genre i usually don't enjoy.. But fuller could turn any story into gold..",1183766400,4,1082,4.73015873015873

2228813,5,B0007PALOI,"Forty Guns by Sam Fuller is about the strangest, most unusual, and bizarre ""B"" western made in the 1950's. I have watched it many times and I'm still not completely sure what the total plot of the film is and at various points during the film the plot switches to such strange directions that you as the viewer are wondering where the film is going and what's going on. Each time I watch it the more bizarre it looks. It is a western so unusual and strange that it is extremely entertaining and enjoyable. Most of the characters in this film are simply ""Off the Hook"" to use the slang of the kids today. I really like this film but I'm not completely sure exactly why. The characters that I enjoy the most are of course Barbara Stanwyck as the master of this giant ranch who rules with an iron hand, Barry Sullivan as the hired killer turned marshall who is a man who feels his time is over in the old west, and John Ericson who is Barbara Stanwyck's younger brother who is basically just crazy and shoots the original older town sheriff for fun and then kills Gene Barry on his wedding day - a very healthy individual. Dean Jagger's performance is also very strange and he hangs himself after trying to shoot Barry Sullivan and then being rejected by Barbara Stanwyck who he has secretly been in love with for years. All and all, one of the strangest westerns and movies for that matter that I have ever seen. I like it.

Barbara Stanwyck goes everywhere with her forty hired guns; they even all eat together at her huge dining table in her fabulous mansion.  Why did she need forty hired guns?  Well, it makes a great visual impression to see them all ride together.  ( Personally, I would have economized and had twenty hired guns ).  I would mention the plot of this movie, but there really isn't one.  Griff ( Barry Sullivan ) is apparently a bounty hunter who needs to arrest one of the forty hired guns.  He has a warrant and Miss Stanwyck graciously gives the man up.  She has apparently already fallen in love with Griff, even though he pistol-whipped her psychopathic kid brother when he first rode into town.

8050065,3,B0007PALOI,"Released in 1957, Forty Guns is a B&W Western that revolves around an authoritarian rancher, Jessica Drummond (Barbara Stanwyck), who rules an Arizona county with her private entourage of hired guns. When two marshal brothers arrive to set things aright (Barry Sullivan and Gene Barry), the cattle queen finds herself falling for the former. Both have young brothers who are problematic. Eve Brent plays a curvy gun-maker.

The movie has a number of positives:

-  The opening sequence is great with its apocalypse of thundering horses led by Jessica on a lone white horse (symbolically?).

- The tornado sequence is well-done with Jessica getting dragged by her horse and her subsequent monologue after the storm, hooking up with Griff (Sullivan).

- Eastwood's renowned Unforgiven (1992) was obviously influenced by Forty Guns: Both feature a remote town without justice or law and order, an existential wasteland. Crooked, murderous Sheriff Logan (Dean Jagger), embodying the breakdown of social order, is similar to Hackman in Unforgiven; and his suicide is very eerily done. A blind marshal (Worden) is a literal joke on ""blind justice"" and another symbol of the impotence of law & order.

- The long shoot-up of the town by the wet-nose Brock is grand mayhem. In Unforgiven the attack on the prostitute by two young cowboys (also referred to as ""boys"") serves as the same type of initial, youthful, anarchic transgression which has to be set straight.

- A gruesome, dressed-up corpse in a coffin, put on full display on the main street, with accompanying, hand-written vindictive placards, is also seen in Unforgiven. In each its a grotesque slap to decency and civilization.

- The town ambush of Griff by Charlie Savage (fitting name) next to a row of empty coffins is effective, particularly the straight-up vertical shot of the window with the assassin's rifle sticking out.

- While the ""Woman with a Whip"" song is dated, ill-fitting and corny, the score is otherwise suited to the content.

- The stylish, irreverent way the movie strays from Western tradition reveals it to be the precursor to the (mostly lame) spaghetti Westerns of the 60s.

- Other highlights include: The shot of Wes's widow in black against the sky; the leitmotifs of the foal and hearse, representing the extremes of birth and death; the comedy at the baths; the sexy female gunsmith seen through a rifle barrel, a jarring juxtaposition of the feminine and force, as is the case with Jessica.

Because of these positives Forty Guns is often touted as a groundbreaking Western. While true, it's also a decidedly average 50s Western filled with unbelievable dialogue/characterizations and deliberately contrived scenes, not to mention the storys just dull and its shot in B&W.  Just because it strays from the mold of traditional Westerns doesn't make it a good movie.

The film runs 79 minutes and was shot in Arizona.
