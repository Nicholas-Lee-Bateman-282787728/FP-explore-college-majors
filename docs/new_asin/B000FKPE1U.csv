8124294,5,B000FKPE1U,I had this on VHS when it first came out and I loved then and of course I love it still now I have it on DVD!,1484006400,,109,3.074074074074074
8124295,4,B000FKPE1U,"Although a tad pricey for an older anime the product was ultimately worth it. For it's age the show is well drawn, the art style was on par, what little music was at least done well and the English dubbing was at least good but not spot on. The story is a bit quick and strange. It involves an explorer who is hunting something called the Lost Powers Of The Tattoon. When the explorer meets one of the tribal members they reach an agreement. The explorer can continue research if her son will be passed on in marriage...completely without his knowledge. The son turns out to be a hot tempered, tough, mean character named Eric who has a ton of righteous fury only mismatched by lack of experience with women and suddenly he finds himself being chased by a powerful and mysterious (and downright gorgeous blond) named Balla who has full blown tattoon powers. So now a hot tempered tough guy has a powerful, beautiful, and somewhat crazy woman constantly flaunting him and teasing him and getting him into all kinds of comical situations. She simply insists they are married and he insists she's totally bonkers.

Would I recommend this title? Sure.  It's just that nothing much is to be expected from this anime and some anime fans might be a bit disappointed due to how short this series is and that the characters really do not have a chance to develop and flourish. For an anime about an hour long it's what you could expect.",1434758400,,1427,4.5703125

8124298,3,B000FKPE1U,"I didn't buy it here, insted I bought the DVD at a convention, I was seeing if there were other due to this cover art and thouhg there was another few episodes.

Any way.
This is funny but my biggest issue is the English dub! oh for god sakes the changing the names really bothered me! What was wrong with using the original names!. I can understand if the dub was done in the late 80's/early 90's but still my god Hibo ( Eric) voice just doesn't fit in the english!

 Like I said the story and animation was good but the English dub was really awful!, This need a serious Re-dubbing! ! from now on I'll just watch the orignal japanese dub !",1414022400,,641,4.153225806451613

8124300,5,B000FKPE1U,"This is a good little anime that I would have loved to see a full series of but sadly this is all that was made. The only other thing I can really mention about is this like Cyber City the English dub is VERY different from the Japanese subs. This literally gives characters a totally different personality and some of the story changes.
All in all a good anime if you're really short on time.",1403049600,,393,4.253333333333333
