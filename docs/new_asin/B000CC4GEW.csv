2455553,4,B000CC4GEW,"A comparison of personalities is made here. Wellington had the advantage of knowing the area and choosing the higher ground to hide over half his men out of reach of the cannon fire. Also the deluge of rain throughout the night and morning saturated and softened the ground so the cannons were difficult to maneuver. When the cannon balls were fired, they became mired in mud instead of ricocheting along and plowing into enemy lines. The rain delayed the battle and gave extra time for the 76-year-old Prussian General Blucher to arrive. Wellington was depending on Blucher and would not have fought without his dogged determination and commitment of 120,000 soldiers to add to his 100,000 soldiers. Napoleon had 125,000 superior trained soldiers equipped with better artillery. Napoleon could not fight them both simultaneously; he had to dispose of the British forces before the Prussians stormed the field. Towards the end of the day-long battle, frustration was mounting on both sides. This is evident when Marshal Ney was attempting to exploit a perceived weakness in Wellington's center. Ney sent Colonel Heymes requesting more troops, and Napoleon incredulously responded, ""Des troops! Ou voulez-vous que j'en prenne? Voulez-vous que j'en fasse""? (Troops! Where do you expect me to get them? Do you think I can manufacture some?) Wellington was also becoming disheartened when he felt certain defeat at one point and responded, ""Give me night or give me Blucher."" This 1970 movie gives you a real sense of how it happened.",1471651200,,1530,5.14859437751004
2455554,2,B000CC4GEW,"We started to watch the Napoleon movie about Waterloo that I bought for Christmas, the one filmed in 1970 by some Russian director. Unfortunately I think it is horrible as a film. We can barely continue to watch it, and we have gotten to the beginning of the actual battle. What did you like about it? The only good point I can see is Orson Welles at Louis XVIII, and that is a small part with hardly any lines. The American actor playing Napoleon,  Rod Steiger, is totally inappropriate. His version seems over the top with Napoleon as some half crazy, emotionally unstable weirdo.  I'm shocked that Christopher Plummer as Wellington isn't doing much better for different reasons. His portrayal is very flat. It is probably the script which lacks forward drive and action. The pacing is way too slow. Also there is no point of view character, which makes battle scenes in particular hard to manage. Contrast it for instance with Gone with the Wind where most everything is from Scarlett's point of view. You may not see much of the battle scenes but  you feel their impact because you take them in from her point of view and they become part of the forward thrust of the action.",1467590400,,1179,4.604761904761904

I remember the film when it first came out, and thought it great at the time but now in hindsight I think that it is time for a remake.

The French cavalry charge is better portrayed, but still totally bad.  Even the British infantry is not portrayed correctly.  Oh, for a few stunt men!

2455584,5,B000CC4GEW,"This quite unique 1970 Soviet-Italian production with American and British cast is possibly the BEST screen reconstruction of a great historical battle. I saw this film no less than four times and I loved every minute of it - each time.

Soviet director Serguei Bondarchuk, who was already famous for his incredible 431 minutes long monumental ""War and peace"" (1966-67) signed here another masterpiece. This film really shows the terror and the beauty of large Napoleonic Wars battles probably as well as it was humanly possible to show them in 1970. Bondarchuk received 16 000 Soviet soldiers and an authentic  2000 riders strong brigade of cavalry to participate in this film - and he didn't waste even one of them...

Both main actors did a great job. Christopher Plummer is grandiose as Wellington, even if his character is a little bit too cheerful and smiling - the real man was much colder, more distant, quite condescending and definitely scarier and more ruthless. Rod Steiger is also excellent as Napoleon (it is possibly his greatest role ever), although here again, his character is somehow changed compared to real Emperor, with unnecessary elements of buffoonery added by Bondarchuk (who, after all, was Russian and therefore quite prejudiced against this great man).

Amongst supporting actors Jack Hawkins is of course excellent as General Picton, Michael Wilding is very good as General Ponsonby, Terence Alexander portrays a very convincing Earl of Uxbridge and there is also a nice cameo by Orson Welles who plays king Louis XVIII.

But amongst the supporting cast this is Dan O'Herlihy who delivers the most poignant performance as Marshal Michel Ney, Prince of Moscova, ""Le Brave des Braves"" (the Bravest of the Braves), a man who has no illusions about the issue of the fight he is fighting and therefore just wants to die with honor - which was denied to him as he survived Waterloo just to be executed in December 1815... As a last honor he was authorised to command himself the firing squad, which he did in following words: ""Soldiers, when I give the command to fire, fire straight at my heart. Wait for the order. It will be my last to you. I protest against my condemnation. I have fought a hundred battles for France, and not one against her ... Soldiers, fire!""

There are of course some differences between the real battle and the one we see on the screen, but in the great lines this film shows the battle of Waterloo as it was, a monumental, terrifying clash of great armies led by great captains - and it shows it very well.

A very useful and true thing shown in this film is that Napoleon was in 1815 already quite sick and his body was betraying him - he was going to die five years later aged barely 52 - which actually played a role in his performance in this last campaign...

The one thing that this film doesn't show is that by ending Napoleonic epic adventure this battle caused also the whole continental Europe to be grasped with utmost cruelty by the iron fist of Holy Alliance and its successors - a choking hold which destroyed all aspiration for liberty until the alliance was ultimately shattered by the Crimean War, which was won, amongst others, by Bonaparte's heir - Emperor Napoleon III...

That little reserve notwithstanding, this is an AMAZING, GRANDIOSE film and an absolutely obligatory viewing for all history freaks and amateurs of good cinema. A film to buy, watch and keep. ENJOY!",1403049600,,3443,4.802364864864865

I am very interested in the Battle of Waterloo, and this was an excellent depiction of the time surrounding it as well as the battle.

Even the battles come off as a mismatched mess. Rod Steiger as Napoleon is also one of cinema's worst blunders, he meanders around his study, uttering melodramatic platitudinous proclamations, I can hardly comprehend how the whole of France followed this numskull (in this version).

The British scenes are not much better, they come off as pompous, elementary imbeciles, who are dancing at an extravagant ball while the whole of Europe is about to engage in one of history's most bloodiest battles, not that they were any different in real life.

Sergei Bonarchuk's so called epic is hardly such, its more of a bloated spectacle which is highly overrated.",1391472000,,852,5.122302158273381

2455600,5,B000CC4GEW,"The 1970 movie ""Waterloo"" is available on DVD in this 2010 Castaway Pictures edition.  Picture quality is only average, but well worth it.  Rod Steiger heads a solid cast as Napoleon, Emperor of France, joined by Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington, his English nemesis.

""Waterloo"" is a full-scale dramatization of the decisive 1815 battle, as Napoleon returns from enforced exile for one last run at glory as French Emperor.  The movie offers the spectacle of hundreds of properly uniformed extras marching and charging around a Waterloo battlefield, accompanied by lots of artillery fire and backed by a stirring musical score.  The narrative highlights different individuals on both sides, but the focus is on Napoleon and his primary adversary Wellington.  The action sequences can be hard to follow, but the movie builds to a gripping sense of suspense at the crisis of the battle, as Napoleon's vaunted Old Guard makes its final assault on British lines and as the Prussian army arrives on the field.

""Waterloo"" is not a precise reenactment.  It is more like a highlight reel; sharp-eyed students of the battle will recognize a number of key events and anecdotes on screen.  The Dutch and German troops in Wellington's army are ignored; Blucher's Prussians get little screen time.  The emphasis is on the psychological duel between a fading, physically ailing and increasingly desperate Napoleon and the cool, tough, aloof aristocrat Wellington.  Steiger and Plummer succeed in their characterizations.

""Waterloo"", made in the wake of the battle's 150th anniversay, was intended for an audience generally familiar with its importance.  It is still recommended to that audience.  This reviewer saw the movie in its original theatrical release, and still finds it a thrill to watch.",1330473600,,1799,5.244755244755245

2455602,4,B000CC4GEW,"After being banished to Elba, Napoleon Bonaparte (Rod Steiger) returns in triumph to Paris to reclaim his Emperor's throne while King Louis XVIII (a mountainous Orson Welles) flees the city. But his glory is short lived as he meets the armies of Wellington (Christopher Plummer) at the battle of Waterloo. This handsome epic, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk (1967's WAR AND PEACE), is a mixed bag. With the exception of a well done ball sequence, the dramatic portions tend to be stagnant. But the battle scenes, which occupy the second half of the film, are pretty awesome. More so because it's not CGI the way it would be today. Filmed in the Soviet Union, the Russians not only helped fund the film but provided some 16,000 soldiers to act as background in the battle scenes. When you see some of the incredible aerial shots or the charging armies, you know it's real people on the screen, not computer generated images. Steiger, while an odd choice for Napoleon, is effective in his restrained scenes while his eye popping acting is distracting in others. The Nino Rota score is a dud but Armando Nannuzzi gives the film a nice sheen whether the rich looking interiors or the vast exteriors.

Through a comedy of errors, I ended up with both DVDs and I like the *Russian* edition much better. So here is the body of my review:

Only rarely is one lucky enough to encounter a terrific film treasure such as this one. Of course this account is a true one but beyond that, it's so well-told here that I wonder how I might have overlooked it until now.

Here we have the story of Napoleon's ultimate demise, his defeat by the British Duke of Wellington at Waterloo (in Belgium) who was aided late in the episode by the Prussian Army. The Emperor of France had suffered a monumental defeat in Russia, where he had lost nearly half a million men in 1812 and it wasn't long before he was exiled by his adversaries to the Island of Elba with several hundred of his loyal guards to keep him company.

About ten months later, Napoleon escaped his island home only to return to France, there usurping a briefly-ruling King Louis XVIII [played by Orson Wells in the film], and again declaring himself Emperor. Almost immediately he had to face Wellington's challenge, the latter having picked his ground carefully.

This 128-minute 1970 movie is superb on several fronts:

1. The battle scenes are epic with no shortage of extras, all in flawless period costume and equipped with the appropriate accoutrements of war. All the troop movements were carried out in an astonishingly precise manner.

2. The cinematography is first-class, here depicted in letterbox format, (Panavision, Technicolor.)

3. The film includes several actors of The First Water, Napoleon being played by Rod Steiger who was perfect in every sense for this role. The Duke of Wellington was played by Christopher Plummer who yielded a slightly hammy performance but was likely inspired to do so by a somewhat lyrical script. Dan O'Herlihy also co-stars.

4. The filmscore by Nino Rota is quite excellent, very appropriate for such a presentation.
The film itself represented a cooperative effort between Bondarchuk and producer Dino de Laurentiis. This was perhaps a lucky thing since it meant that Bondarchuk was permitted to use the Soviet Army for the battle scenes!

5. With the minor exception of a little poetic license, the historical account of all that transpired is largely correct.

You won't get hurt on this one - highly recommended.",1301097600,,3081,5.55982905982906

Rod Steiger was perfect for the part. The opening scene showing only the boots of his Generals ,echoing of the granite floors as they hurry to tell him he has been defeated for the first time, sticks out in my mind. They plead with him to surrender and he shouts no// so loud he echos off the walls. Camera work is great and the action is pure classic Hollywood even tho it was shot overseas by a foreign director.

2455613,4,B000CC4GEW,"This is a unique film and a favorite of military historians since the entire film focuses on the battle of Waterloo with minimal interference with other storylines. Directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, the film is a visual masterpiece for its ability to depict warfare, especially the complex games played between Napoleon and Wellington in the battle of Waterloo. The film gives just enough background story to make the battle of Waterloo make sense. We see Napoleon defeated and sent into exile, the return of the rotund obese Louis XVIII, and then Napoleon's amazing return from the island of Elba to raise France again in arms against the world. However these background scenes take up less than 45 minutes and the entire final half of the film is dedicated to the battle of Waterloo. Rod Steiger gives an interpretation of Napoleon as a military and political genius who is not quite up to the brilliance he demonstrated in his early career before the defeat in Russia. He plays and temper driven Napoleon. The script calls for Napoleon to also be highly concerned about his young son Napoleon, whom his wife has taken back to Vienna with her. In contrast to the emotional inspirational Napoleon, Christopher Plumber plays a cool and distant Wellington, a man who keeps strategy to himself, never revealing his final plans even to his highest officers. Wellington, as played by Plumber, is a distant man, not emotionally connected to his officers or his men, who sees warfare almost as a chess game full of moves and counter moves and efforts to out think the opposition leadership. Orson Wells plays the obese Louis XVIII, called back for the Bourbon restoration after Napoleon is sent into exile, only to have to leave France again once Napoleon escapes from Elba to raise an army.  The primary strength of the film is the depiction of the battle scenes including all the complexity of the cavalry, artillery, and infantry moves on both sides. The battle scenes must have used thousands of people to convey the scope of the battles.  The colors of the uniforms certainly also helps the viewer understand the battles. The French wore red, white, and blue while the English wore red and white. This was contrasted with the Prussians, fighting on the side of the English, who wore all black.  The cavalry charges were especially well developed and filmed with amazing coordination of horses and riders. The aerial photography of the French charge against the British squares was indeed fascinating and the photography told the entire story of these contrasting strategies.  Napoleon's charismatic leadership was captured well by Steiger and certainly helps explain this amazing time in history. During much of the battle, the results could have gone either way and this keeps the viewer engaged as fortune shifts back and forth between the two armies. In the end, I admit I was amazed that so much attention and detail was put on this battle in this production. It is a movie about a significant final battle in a significant war, photographed perfectly, with incredible detail focuses on the art of warfare.",1286755200,,3106,4.955854126679463

However, both this DVD and the videotape version are edited by at least 20 minutes.  I saw the original release in England in 1970, and it was more like 2+27 or 2+30 at that time.  This movie completely chops out an excellent battle of Ligny sequence of about 10-15 minutes, more character development in the Ball scenes, and elsewhere.  This has been alluded to in other reviews, and I can explicitly confirm it here.  I bought this DVD elsewhere last year on the explicit statement that it was the ""full length"" version.  It is NOT.

2455617,5,B000CC4GEW,"'Waterloo' is one of the films that I have greatly enjoyed over the years. I have a interest in the Napoleonic period and this film does a good job of depicting the famous end of it. Rod Steiger as Napoleon is one of my favorite performances of one of my favorite historical characters. Steiger has some of the best lines in the film- many taken from actual historical quotes. His moody depiction of Napoleon is always interesting to watch. Not to be outmatched is Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington who really does a good job playing the aristocratic Duke. Plummer also has plenty of good lines. He also has a nice scene with a foraging soldier. There is also a great cross cutting scene in the film the night before the battle that makes it seem that Napoleon and Wellington are talking to one another.

Dan O' Herlihy is also excellent as Marshall Ney.

The massive numbers of men are also a highlight in the movie. There were around 20,000 men from the Red Army playing the French, English, and Prussian forces. These sheer numbers without any computer graphics is just fascinating to watch. Ney's cavalry charge is one of the highlights of the movie. It needs to be seen on a big screen.

A proper DVD release is needed in the US. It needs to be anamorphic and also as full length of a version of the film as possible. Commentaries and any other extras would be appreciated by fans of the film. This movie deserves to be better known.

This is no CGI like 'Troy' and such, this is literally cast of thousands, if only Russian soldiers as extras, the only other country that could actually brag of using real extras in this number is China right now, where movies could still be made with such large number of extras... even then, they still use CGI to suppliment the scenes.

As to the film, it is sad that it could only be view in its original, aged condition and only available from DVD produced overseas either in England or Hong Kong; yet, Hollywood's lost is our gain, for now, because we could get the movie relatively cheap online here.

For such an epic movie, it is relatively fast paced. I could not but feel overwhelmed during the battle scenes. All I could say is... Wow!!!

Once again, viewing this movie, it makes me wondered, once again, whether Napoleon should be seen as a villian or a great man... or a little of both. Undeniably, he was one of the greatest leader whom could command such loyalty from his army- and respects from his enemies!

2455627,4,B000CC4GEW,"""Waterloo"" is the lavish 1970 Italian-Russian dramatization of Napoleon's return from exile in 1815 and his subsequent campaign against an Allied military force in Belgium, culminating in his decisive defeat at Waterloo.

A brief prologue traces the circumstances of Napoleon's abdication from his throne as Emperor of the French in 1814 and his exile to the Island of Elba.  The movie opens with Napoleon's daring return, as the sheer power of his personality cult enables him to face down the very forces sent to take him into custody.  Napoleon's return to Paris prompts the Allied Coalition that forced his abdiction to reform and send British and Prussian armies into Belgium.

The movie features excellent period authenticity.  Actors appear in the correct uniforms and equipment; the battle scenes feature large formations of infantry and cavalry moving over a battlefield that generally resembles the Mount St. Jean original in Belgium.

The movie is superbly cast.  Rod Stieger is entirely credible as the aging but still fiercely ambitious and egotistical Napoleon.  Christopher Plummer is pitch-perfect as the aristocratic Duke of Wellington, highly capable leader of a British-Dutch Army, acting in concert with a Prussian Army under General Blutcher. Orson Welles has a nice cameo as Louis XVIII.  The supporting cast universally look their parts.

The Battle of Waterloo has been challenging for generations of historians to describe.  Likewise, this movie dramatization can be very difficult to follow.  The movie faithfully depicts various dramatic moments in the battle, although it seems to presume some prior knowledge on the part of the viewer as to the context of those moments.  It repeatedly changes points of view, alternating for the most part between Napoleon and Wellington.  There are several supporting vignettes involving Marshall Ney and others.  The movie succeeds in building up enormous dramatic tension as the battle nears its climax, even if the viewer may not be entirely clear on what is happening and why.

This movie is highly recommended to fans of the Napoleonic era as perhaps the best-available dramatization of the Battle of Waterloo.",1176595200,,2179,5.346041055718475

2455629,5,B000CC4GEW,"Director Sergei Bandarchuk recreates the 1815 battle of Waterloo.  The phrase 'They just don't make 'em like that anymore' immediately comes to mind.  You will never see another film made on this scale again with literally a 'cast of thousands' of uniformed soldiers and extras.  Vast in scope.  It will all be CGI from now on, which can be very good, but will never equal this kind of huge undertaking.  The only scene's that can top these are from Russian director Sergei Bondarchuk's previous, even more epic film, War and Peace.  I think I can remember reading in Guiness Book of World Records one time that he used 100,000 men from the Russian Army to recreate the 1812 battle of Borodino in what may be, adjusted for inflation, the most expensive film in history. I understand he again used Russian Army soldiers as extras for this film.

This is a film that deserves a top notch remastering into HD.  This version is good and well worth watching but you will understand what I am saying because of the tremendous amount of detail present in the film that just does not fully come across in this transfer.

I thought Christopher Plummer played Wellington to perfection as far as everything I have ever read about him and his actions during the battle.  Rod Stieger is great as Napoleon with all of his personal quirks.  All of the other actors seemed well cast.

I don't know if it's true that there is a longer version or not but a few early scenes do seem rather disjointed such as the part where Napoleon has just won the battle of Ligny.  There is absolutely no lead in for the viewer and virtually no developement of the character of the Prussian  Marshall Blucher.  If you had never read on the subject you would be completely lost.  Some of the scenes perfectly recreate famous paintings of the battle I have seen such as the charge of the Scot's Grey's and the attack of Napoleons 'Old Guard'. The attention to detail is superb.

This version has one problem and that is the subtitles will not turn off once you have turned them on, so don't do it.  The English subtitles are completely rediculous, if you actually read them, they are so far off from what is actually being said to be a complete joke.  Otherwise, it's Chinese characters, which are at least less distracting than the assinine and distracting English one's.  How this is the only version available is beyond me.

So do yourself a favor and check out this great film.",1172188800,,2446,4.589861751152074
2455630,5,B000CC4GEW,"In the tradition of the cinematic epics like Kubrick's ""Spartacus"" and Mann's ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" Bondarchuk's ""Waterloo"" succeeds in depicting Napoleon's desperate and final bid for power and glory.  Steiger, no stranger to roles that have consistently challenged his acting ability, is quite good as the deposed French emperor who narrowly lost his final battle.  Orson Welles' appearance as Louis XVIII, is far too brief but most welcome, and Plummer as Lord Wellington is a casting director's dream. Dino de Laurentiis has produced some questionable if not laughable films in the past ""King Kong"" (1976) and ""Flash Gordon"" (1980); however, ""Waterloo"" must be seen as one of his better efforts.

Many critics here at Amazon will applaud the many and well-orchestrated battle scenes--a case-in-point are the great aerial shots of the British ""squares"" organized against Marshall Ney (Dan O' Herlihy) and the French cavalry--and one can easily understand the film's strong visual appeal, but this opus succeeds in other ways too.

The non-battle scenes, for instance, like the ball before the battle which introduces us to Napoleon's nemesis, Wellington, and the scenes of Napoleon dictating letters to his secretaries, are thoughtful touches that broaden the scope of this highly entertaining film and successfully depict an aristocratically genteel milieu shattered by the cataclysm that is nineteenth-century warfare. On the surface, an era characterized by the gentility of the landed gentry and sportsmanlike conduct on the battlefield, later destroyed by the real brutalities and devastation of war.

Unlike too many directors who take liberties with depicting historical events (Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" quickly come to mind), Bondarchuck successfully and accurately depicts Napoleon in his decline--plagued with self-doubt, his irascible outbursts towards subordinates compounded by his ill-health (now confirmed by modern bio-historians as a combination of dysuria, piles, dermatitis, and stomach cancer) and his symptoms of grandiose delusion .

Like the Russian version of ""War and Peace"", the movie leaves me breathless, and a bit rattled.  I won't repeat the story over again, you're likely snoring by now from all the previous reviews, but I'll say that I love this movie, and it would complete my collection of war epics once I've got my eager hands on the DVD version.

Much like many Eastern European movies, ""Waterloo"" seems disjointed in some parts, even surreal, and clearly, some of the battle scenes were borrowed from ""War and Peace.""  I forgive you Sergei, just don't do it again.  The part when Napoleon's Old Guard march shoulder to shoulder to anhiliation, is simply incredible.  I could actually smell the cordite from the cannons, the fear and confusion in every French heart.  I got chills from this scene.  Rod Steiger looks like he's on drugs.  Despite is super acting as Napoleon, he looks spaced out sometimes, or perhaps worried that the movie will flop.  Yet, he pulled it off, he WAS Napoleon Bonaparte in all his menace, his mood swings, his pride, his appearance (though it's rumored that Steiger is nearly 6 feet tall, when NB was just shy of 5 feet).  Must have NP's ego that made him seem larger than life.  In conclusion: I urge all history buffs to demand the 3 hour DVD version, anything shorter would be a rip off, or go sulk in the dark like me.

One final note: I have a 47 inch Panasonic projection HDTV.  The wide screen brings epic movies to real life.  I hope the DVD version is not tarnished like some parts of ""War and Peace.""",1140393600,,1690,4.491803278688525

A pity that, as it usually happens with massive and costly productions, the final product falls so short of expectations. Orson Wells, since the very first scene looks like a wig on a monkey, he should have done much better being behind the camera directing. The cast is not the problem, though. It's the script, the slow pace, the artificial atmosphere of grandeur a la francaise, the absence of feeling.

This does not qualify as a film. As a documentary, yes, and a badly done one too. I was going to watch the director's try on ""War and Peace"" but I have definitely given it up now.

If Stanley Kubrick couldn't get it done (it meaning Waterloo) and no classic director ever attempted it, how can we expect anything great from this Bondarchuk... King Vidor tried something epic with War and Peace and it never made it to one of his best (though a decent film). Hitchcock said once to Truffaut that he wouldn't try recreating a true literary classic because masterpieces can't be copied into other formats. Just like Don Quixote was created into a book it cannot (it has not so far) be copied into cinematographic language with the same results (Welles tried and couldn't finish).

I can never decide about Christopher Plummer's interpretation of Wellington.  A little too Christopher Plummer and missing the depth that Rod Steiger brings to his rather wonderful Napoleon.

The movie is a distillation of the key points of the rather longer and more complicated battle but seems reasonably accurate in the parts it does portray when compared to historical accounts.

Finally - after a long search to locate this OOP movie - I found a copy several years ago on VHS from a ""movie archive house"" on the west coast. Recently, I purchased a duped DVD on eBay, as the only region it is available on at this time is region 2 and PAL.
This is one fo the best historical war epics of all time. Plummer and Stieger are superb in their roles as Wellington and Napolean, respectively... and, the aerial shots of the British squares under attack by French cavalry, alone, earn this movie 5 stars from me.
What I detect, unfortunately, from the edited version (which is the only version I know of available on any format right now) is, well... that it has been edited!!!
There are far too many choppy transitions between scenes, and their are characters and sub-plots that seem tossed into the mix without any apparent reason. I have to believe that there was more time devoted to such major scenarios as the fighting in and around Hougoumont...... I have to believe that there IS a scene - somewhere - showing the circumstances of why Wellington sent his best troops to the complex, and the importance surrounding this sector of the battle. How can the story of the battle for Hougoumont be complete without the closing of the North Gate by the heroic band of Coldstream Guards? In the edited version, we are only shown teasing glimpses - in a fast-forwarded timeline - of fighting in and around the farm complex that was such a vital part of the battlefield. La Haiye Sainte is also breezed over in the edited version.
What we get with the edited version is a movie consisting of some of the grandest and breath-taking battle scenes. But the FILM - as presented at this time - is disjointed and incomplete as a whole. ""Gettysburg"" is a long movie (could hjave been longer, still!).... ""Waterloo"" needs the same running time to be a complete film.
What is called for - and it is high time we see it happen - is the un-edited, original ""Director's cut"" version on DVD. But not only on DVD - region 1 DVD!",1083628800,,2195,4.476309226932669
2455640,2,B000CC4GEW,"I'd like to supplement the other reviews. Waterloo did indeed screen in a 3-plus hour version which I attended in college circa 1972. In that edition, I would rate it 5 stars, for it did have the historical accuracy and timeline of 'The Longest Day' and the sweep and drama of such great period films as 'Ben-Hur' or 'Gone With The Wind'. But without all the personal subplots, the action was more intense and that helped this viewer stay focused. I was pretty-much blown away, so I did some homework.
This film is extraordinary for both it's scope and the high level of authentic detail. The uniforms, weapons and accoutrements are very accurate, and the battlefield tactics reflect great study on the part of the set decorators and stunt coordinators. From the individual line soldier with his flint musket to the massed artillery barrages and calvary charges, the period 'manuals of arms' were followed [rules for troop deployment; use and operation of weapons] in more detail for this era that has been committed to film before.
In contrast, each combat scene was reconstructed not from the combatant's surviving journals, but from art works made AFTER the battle and when the action periodically 'freezes' on-screen for a few seconds, each freeze is in fact a tableaux of a famous painting, many of which are on view at the Lourve or the Hermitage.
Someone said read your history for a fuller understanding? Okay, but try looking up the paintings and then re-view the film with those images in mind. Many master's art works are capured in hue and composition when the action freezes as perfectly as the arms and tactics. The effect is to make it seem as if the art was purloined from filmed news coverage somehow. I was blown away all over again!
Every film is a Hollywood magic show [or the eastern equivalent in this case]. But the inclusion of so much historical fine art is one of the best smoke and mirrors tricks ever put to film; shrewd, subtle, and a reminder that art imitates art itself as much is it imitates life.
The VHS version wouldn't fit on one tape if it contained the whole film. It was butchered by editors unfamiliar with the historical timeline, the weapons and tactics, or the art! I can hardly give it two stars in this edition.
So give us a region-1 DVD and please! Make it the director's movie, not some truncated and confused mass of sound and fury.",1078358400,,2381,4.684964200477327
2455641,5,B000CC4GEW,"This is a superb movie which I was able to obtain as a used VHS on Eb*y. The battle scenes are unforgettable. Christopher Plummer brings Wellington to life, Rod Steiger is an excellent Napoleon, especially compared to the recent unintentionally comic Napoleon of Christian Clavier.
It is not available on DVD and is OOP on VHS in America. Amazing when you think of all the unwatchable trash that is available complete with documentaries and multiple commentary tracks.
A previous reviewer suggest buying a copy from Amazon.co.uk. I did just that last summer and the DVD arrived surprisingly fast all the way from England. Unfortunately, not only as it region 2, which can be defeated relatively easily, but it also recorded in PAL, the ""other"" home video standard that is completely incompatible with the NTSC televisons and DVD players that are used in the U.S. There are specialty DVD players that will read both PAL and NTSC DVDs and output a NTSC video signal as well as other much more complicated ways of watching PAL DVDs (buying a PAL DVD player and a PAL television for example) but it is hardly worth spending hundreds of dollars to do so just to watch a few sought after but locally unavailable movies.",1074643200,,1213,4.8086124401913874
2455642,5,B000CC4GEW,"One of your reviewers mentioned a DVD version of this superb movie. So I checked at IMDB and found this DVD - by a good studio - at Amazon.co.uk. It's the original widescreen version. Running time 128' instead of 132' - but that may be due to the transfer. The snag: it's code 2. So how come you Americans let yourself be ruled by that  encoding racket? Where I live everybody sneers at it: coded DVD-players have no chance on the market. Not even the mugs will buy them. Either you get yourself a codefree DVD-Player (down to $ 70.- at the time at Basle, Switzerland - only a 110V-adapter needed to run it at your place), or a program to break that bl... encoding. How much interfering do you stomach?
You could profit by all the DVDs classics offered on Amazon.co.uk and  Amazon.fr.
Never mind - it's your very free choice (?) of your own. I'm glad market conditions have taken the choice out of my hands. No enforced encoding where I live - if they want to sell!

2455643,5,B000CC4GEW,"When this movie was released in 1970 it was said to have contained a lot more footage. I have heard rumors that a 3 hr version exists somewhere. This would make more sense as the scenes with the Prussians appear disjointed, and even the Quarte Bras scene seems out of context. The movie had to be reduced in length for cinema release, but the result has provided only an inperfect picture of the Waterloo drama and all its complexities. A DVD release would hopefully correct some of this problem by allowing more footage, perhaps cleaning up the film itself, and add some much needed background information and production notes. It would be interesting to see where the film was shot, what army was used for extras, and also what Rod Steiger and Chrisopher Plummer thought of their roles in the film. All of this would add greatly to what is already an epic work.

Not-withstanding these short-comings, what we have is still an impressive work. Few period movies have gone to such lengths to provide accuracy. The uniforms are all correct, although the British are shown as the main elements in Wellington's army. It would have been nice to see a bit more blue and green coats in the shots of Wellington's troops on the ridge as this would have shown the significant Dutch-Belgian contingents that made up his army as well.

The casting of Plummer and Stieger also was good. Stieger supposedly said this was one of his favorite roles. Some have critisized his performance of Napolean in the movie, but Stieger seems content to have portrayed a Napolean unsure of himself and in earnest. This is not an unreasonable portrayal to make, and if the viewer can divorce the actor from the historical personage some sense can be made here. This was Napolean's last campaign, and no doubt he felt some uncertainty when he embarked upon it, as the odds were heavily against him. His health was also not what it use to be.

Christopher's Plummer's Wellington is supurb. Here critics can find little that is wrong. He has the Iron Duke's personality down perfectly. The acid wit and cool detached demeanor concealing a real concern for the state of his army and the position it is in to face the great Napolean.  Plummer uses Wellington quotes from all over the place, many from while the Duke was in Spain, and not from Waterloo, but it still works anyway.

Viwers who are not familer with the history may find it difficult to follow the movie, especially since the editing makes it even more confusing at times. Without some historical background the movie may just come across as a series of massive, confused battle scenes, which does injustice to the epic events which it is attempting to show. I would recommend reading any books on the Waterloo campaign in order to get the most out of it. For sheer scope and size, few movies can compare, and the viewer is in for a feast of the eye with this one. With those massive battle scenes the viewer should consider also that these were real extras, not computer CGI images! For a period war movie this is the best, for all its faults.  Waterloo cries out for a DVD director's edition.  Let's hope it happens some day.

PS - There is a recent Chinese-English version out on DVD.  This version runs about the same amount of time but includes a few extra minutes of battle scenes.  A few scenes at Hougamont, and some also with Napolean marching with the Guard before the final assault, as well as when the Guard breaks and panic ensues. The credits also list teh Soviet Army as well as the 1st battalion, The Gordon Highlanders.  Their Drums and Pipes and regimental dancers are featured in the film.  Its not much, and there are no extra features, but those who want a Region 1 edition of the DVD might want to consider it.  Its unfortunate that the Chinese should produce something like this instead of the studio itself!  Will still need a collectors edition.",1029456000,,3900,4.649709302325581
2455644,4,B000CC4GEW,"Waterloo will certainly go down as a benchmark for how to film  jaw-droppingly good battle scenes, but don't forget the almost surprisingly good acting. After all, there's no fighting at all during the film's first half. Instead you get Rod Steiger almost chewing scenery as Napoleon, but still passionately communicating the personal doubts and nervous good cheer as the egomanical French dictator desperately faces his Waterloo. Christopher Plummer's Wellington is Napoleon's comic foil in the film, combining a comical arrogance with a supreme ""stiff upper lip"" confidence. His portrayal shows you how Wellington was never defeated in seven years of fighting the French because he refused to buy into the myth of Napoleon's overwhelming power. Even Orson Welles does a good job in what is essentially a cameo, giving us a Louis XVIII so ground down by years of watching the French mob kill those he loved that he has no fight left in him. We see that fat, reactionary Louis is wiser than Napoleon, the darling of the Enlightenment.
I don't know that Waterloo was pro-war, but what's surprising, considering it came out in 1971, was that it wasn't anti-war. This can probably be explained by the fact that it seemed to be an East European production. Ironically, while left-wing Western Europeans in 1971 were militantly pacifistic, their Warsaw Pact counterparts (who lived in communist societies that Western intellectuals supposedly envied) saw no problem with portraying war in neutral terms when fought for a good purpose. Besides, no one who watches as Wellington gloomily surveys the rows of corpses after the battle can say Waterloo hides that war is a sad, deadly business.
Finally, the music strikes the right combination of pride and melancholy. And the slow-motion battle scenes communicate a jarring surrealism that reminded me of what Speilberg did with Tom Hanks' character on the beach in Saving Private Ryan.",1029283200,,1927,5.176282051282051
2455645,5,B000CC4GEW,"Waterloo, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk is a spectacular depiction of the Battle of Waterloo and the immediate events leading up to it.  Rod Steiger plays Napoleon and gives an intense performance and a vivid insight into the personality of this dictator.  Wellington is played by Christopher Plumber who likewise, gives of his best in portraying this brilliant commander.  The movie weaves an intriguing story, playing off Wellington's arrogance towards his rank and file against his skill in strategy and tactics.  The other main actors, Orson Wells, Jack Hawkins and Dan O'Herlihy all give fantastic performances.  The movie has been criticised for its glorification of war. With very little blood seen in the movie despite a plethora of death and destruction, it's a correct observation, but I don't think you will be watching this movie if you are at all concerned with the rights and wrongs of war. This movie deals with a period of warfare, which was colorful and fought with massive armies. This has captured the imagination of military and historical buffs despite it's relatively short period.  The movie Waterloo has suceeded admirably in conveying this granduer.  Let me say at this point, that this movie is huge in scale and panorama.  The battle scenes of which there are many, are pure eye candy.  No CGI here folks.  This is massive, classic movie making in its prime, and we won't see films made like this again. Battlefields are littered with casts of thousands.  The costumes (uniforms) are excellent and one wonders at how long it took to sew these all together.  I understand many of the cast were supplied by the Polish army.  Watching the movie, you are left in no doubt that the majority of rank and file cast are real soldiers.  To co-ordinate that many extras without military training would have been near impossible.  The cavalry charges are simply stunning and you can't help wondering how many horses were injured in the making of this movie, let alone actors.  The aerial view of the massed French cavalry charge against the British squares, towards the conclusion of the battle, truly lets you understand the scale of this production.  This is an utterly unmissable scene in the history of war movies.  There are many other scenes from the movie which truly capture the imagination.  For example, Napoleons reunion with his devoted troops after his exile, is tense and dramatic, while set in an insignificant part of the French countryside.  Adding to the quality of the movie, most of the lines spoken are actual quotes from the historical figures themselves. I am fortunate to own the DVD version of the movie, and while it doesn't have many special features I would recommend the DVD version version over VHS if you can find a copy, as this movie is one you will want in your collection for a very long time. I loved this movie from beginning to end. It won't be to everyones taste, but is an essential purchase for military and history buffs, and especially those who like movies made in the ""good old way"".

Steiger and Plummer are to my mind spot on.  Wellington was both dour and very charming - otherwise he would not have been so effective as a ladies' man!
I remember going to the original widescreen version at the Odeon in Leicester Square - a truly widescreen.  My recollection of the movie is that it was significantly longer, with additional vignettes featuring at least two of the ""scum of the earth"".  Moreover, I have a distinct feeling that the cavalry charge against the squares is far longer in the orginal version.

2455648,5,B000CC4GEW,"""Waterloo"" and ""Star Wars"" (the original movie) vy for top place in my heart as favorite movie of all time. Needless to say, I LOVE this film!
The battle scene is tremendous. It is a display of colour and cinematography the like of which you will never see again! With all this computer generated stuff, massed battle scenes become easy to manufacture but believe me, NONE of them can match what you see here because it was all done with real people. The expense for the extras and uniforms that must have been spent will leave you in awe!
OK, enough of the battle scene - that and the authenticity of the battle has been covered expertly by another reviewer. Something has to be said about the acting, however - excellent by all who were in it. Steiger plays a believeble Napoleon who is starting to doubt his own military prowess, and Wellington plays a marvellous English aristocrat.
Before the battle scene, all is not just military talk, but there is a hint of love stories between a few of the characters that almost seem out of place. Although they are woven into the story well, a friend explained to me that ""Waterloo"" is merely an edited version of a much longer mini-series type of thing that was originally produced in Russia! That explains the extras en masse, and the fact that some of the charaters seem to be dubbed. That's 'cause they are! It also explains why, as another reviewer pointed out, that some of the characters seem underdeveloped. When I first heard this, it left me feeling kind of cheated, especially as that might have meant that some of the battle scene was missed out too.
Something has to be said about the odd avoidable errors that exist within the film. Some of them you may only spot if you are a true aficionado, and if you have seen the film more than 50 times, as I am sure I have. The ballroom scene - someone thought it would be really nice to have the soldiers in dress uniform doing a waltz with the ladies in beautiful white, flowing dresses. The colourful spectacle was wonderful, as was the music (called the ""Waterloo Waltz"" just in case you don't have the soundtrack, and used in ""War and Peace"", too), but OOPS! Didn't anyone mention that the waltz was not invented until the END of the 19th century? Another obvious anachronism is one scene in the battle with a telegraph pole that I am told is there, but have yet to find myself.
There is one really annoying part of the battle scene that I have to mention. When the French heavy cavalry charge at the British squares, the action is also filmes from the air, so that you are looking directly down on the battle. The cavalry charge in from the top of the scene, but why are there puffs of rifle smoke coming from all the squares on ALL the sides of each square. There is nothing there to shoot at, so it looks as though the squares are firing at each other. ... See ""Waterloo"" and be truly amazed! Enjoy!",1013040000,,2907,4.455909943714822
2455649,5,B000CC4GEW,"Waterloo is probably the best ""battle"" film ever made, depicting the famous clash of Napoleon versus Wellington in June 1815.  Although there are quirks and omissions in this film, overall it does a magnificent job of encapsulating the pathos of Napoleon's Hundred Days.  Rod Steiger as Napoleon and Christopher Plummer as Wellington are both very convincing in their roles, and the director's use of ""inner thought"" to hear what these two are thinking at key moments is very interesting.
  The film covers the Hundred Days, from Napoleon's return from Elba to his defeat at Waterloo, with some attention given to the events preceding the final battle.  Unfortunately, the Battles of Quatre Bras and Ligny just prior to Waterloo are given scant attention, and the Prussian role is minimized.  The presence of Dutch, Belgian, Brunswick and King's German Legion troops in Wellington's force, as well as the role of the Prince of Orange, are ignored.  Although Ney and Picton are major characters, the primary focus is on Napoleon and Wellington. In the battle itself, the opening attack on Hougomont (led by Napoleon's brother Jerome, who is not shown in the film) and Napoleon's basic tactics are covered fairly well.  However, D'Erlon's main attack and the impromptu British cavalry attack is muddled and confused.  The desperate defense of the La Haye Saint farmhouse is only briefly shown, which further muddies the depiction of the battle.  On the other hand, the director spares no effort in depicting the massed French cavalry attacks and the British infantry squares that defied them.  The final assault by the Imperial Guard and the arrival of the French flows rather quickly, without depicting the desperate actions by the Young Guard to hold off Blucher.
  There are very few films that cover an entire battle because it is actually a very difficult task.  Waterloo does not cover every key event or participant, but it does convey the flavor of this famous battle.  Viewers should appreciate the effort and forgive the omissions.",997833600,,2039,5.099397590361446
