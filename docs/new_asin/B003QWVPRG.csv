8402666,4,B003QWVPRG,Simply magnificent. For some reason or another it has not been produced in the West. Pity; the haunting music and the soul-felt dancing couldn't be better!,1390780800,,155,5.0
8402667,3,B003QWVPRG,I havn't seen this yet. Since I am a ballet fanatic I am sure I will like it. I didn't mean to check a star. I love the music!,1375488000,,126,3.3793103448275863
8402668,3,B003QWVPRG,"I was quick to order this when it popped up as a suggested purchase because I love Khatchaturian's music, especially the Masquerade suite, and I love ballets.  This ballet was different than what I expected -- it was choreographed and cut rather like a movie -- in fact, it really reminded me of the old Vincent Price movies.  The bad thing was, even with the plot described on the back of the box, I still felt lost through large portions of the ballet.  I guess I was just kind of disappointed by the choreography -- I expected a little more from this ballet, especially for the price.  It was not terrible, but I do not feel it was worth more than $10 or $15, let alone over $30, although most ballets on dvd do sell for about the same price.
This ballet has its moments - and some pretty costumes and scenery.  Unless you are really into ballets and/or Khatchaturian, though, I would not really recommend this one -- there are much better ballets out there for the price.",1282262400,10,975,4.424581005586592
