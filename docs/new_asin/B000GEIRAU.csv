2606204,3,B000GEIRAU,"Of all the 10 Minute Solution videos, I think that Lara Hudson is my favorite trainer. She's got a couple different options: this Rapid Result Pilates video, a Pilates one, and a Yoga option if I remember correctly (maybe others, but I can't remember). She's got a great attitude, she explains the moves in understandable language, and you really will feel a burn after just ten minutes (and, as I'm sure you've heard before: who doesn't have ten minutes to work out? after a while, you'll get so familiar with the routine you can do it while watching your favorite show).

My problem with these videos is how quickly they became dated. Made in the mid-2000's, they shouldn't have become so unnecessary so quickly. But with everything moving towards digital and streaming, this exact video can now be found on Youtube (for free). Or, if you don't like her style, or Pilates, or want to work out for more or less than 10 minute, you can find something - anything else - to suit your personal fitness pleasure. I get that some people may still be buying these, but - unfortunately - they just aren't what they once were.",1478217600,,1118,4.618090452261306

2606219,4,B000GEIRAU,"I've done all the sessions so far and I do like her voice and overall feel as an instructor. I've never been a class type because I'm a runner and triathlete, but she doesn't annoy me and she isn't spastic:-)",1469059200,,208,4.225
2606220,5,B000GEIRAU,I love this video. I've been doing it off and on for about two years. The instructor is very specific. I like the 10 minute sections. The stretch section is really relaxing.,1464739200,,173,4.4375
2606221,5,B000GEIRAU,"I really enjoy this video. I love how easy it is to pick whichever segments I want to do that day, or play all of them.  The music in the video is not too distracting or annoying.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  I do think the exercises are effective and I'm looking forward to seeing results in not that much time!  The only things you need are a mat and a set of light hand weights for the arm/shoulder segment (1, 2, or 3 pounds...I even used two 16 oz water bottles before I purchased my handweights!).  Would definitely recommend.  :)",1464739200,,556,4.298076923076923

2606224,5,B000GEIRAU,"This is an excellent pilates program for intermediate user. Music is not too horrible and Lara Hudson is a good coach. There is nothing better than pilates for managing lower back pain and increasing flexibility for people who are too ADD to do yoga, and 10 minutes a session is just the right amount of time.",1457222400,,309,4.535714285714286
2606225,2,B000GEIRAU,"I was in a Pilates class for well over a year, but wanted to be able to exercise at home, so I bought this. It was disappointing. I found the moves complicated and difficult, and realized it was pretty boring to watch just one person  - videos that show a small class following the moves are a lot more interesting. I wouldn't recommend this.",1456531200,,342,4.34375

2606228,5,B000GEIRAU,Being a stay at home mother of 3 young kids made it almost impossible to get a workout in so I loved that this dvd is broken down into 10 minute sections. It makes it so convenient but is also still challenging and gets you results.,1454025600,,232,4.065217391304348
2606249,5,B000GEIRAU,Like her instructions and voice.  I like being able to arrange the sequence of the sections. I modify some of the moves. I have never taken a Pilates class but have primarily used DVDs.,1453161600,,185,4.4411764705882355

2606251,5,B000GEIRAU,"I love this video!  The beginning is a little lengthy with the explanation of what to expect but you can move past this and choose what section you want to address. Lara moves quickly, wasting no time and the music is upbeat and enjoyable. The moves are very effective and different. You can really tell you're working every muscle in your body.  I'd highly recommend this DVD!",1452556800,,377,4.611940298507463

2606256,5,B000GEIRAU,I love this idea - 10 minute work! Who does not have 10 minutes - there are 5 different workouts and I LOVE them all.,1438646400,,117,3.72
2606257,5,B000GEIRAU,"I've owned this dvd for many years. I purchased this particular dvd for my daughter on her birthday. It's a fantastic blend of muscle toning - for myself and also for my daughter who is in university and doesn't always have time for a full work-out. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in a beginner to advanced level of strength training.

You can invest ten minutes or fifty - whatever works for you.",1437436800,,411,4.48
2606258,5,B000GEIRAU,"I've always been a fan of pilates, and this video is a great fit for me. I've struggled to stay motivated to exercise over the years and I prefer low-impact aerobic type exercises. I love that there are five 10-minute separate segments that I can choose to do at my own pace and the option to customize an exercise routine. The five segments are Buns & Thighs, Arm & Shoulder Shaper, Waist Slimmer, Total Body Blast, and Slim & Sleek Stretch. Lara Hudson is fantastic, charismatic on screen, likeable and easy to follow. I've been successful in maintaining regular exercise, and I'm best at waist, arms & shoulders and buns & thighs. The stretch segment is challenging but pretty calming, and the full body workout is very intense. I've been keeping up for about a month and within the first week noticed greater core muscle control and stamina during exercise. Lara Hudson's program is awesome and I highly recommend it, plus the price is a great value-- how often do you see the hottest new exercise in an expensive box set? Gimmicky popular routines are unnecessary for me and I prefer to keep my exercise simple and to the point. I like to alternate pilates and a great program called Lastics, plus I just got a ballet workout dvd, but I come back to this often because it is quick and easy to practice and repeat. Get it, it's especially great for beginners too.",1437177600,,1367,4.60655737704918
2606269,5,B000GEIRAU,"I love this DVD. Unlike other workout dvds, this one let's you program your own workouts. With this one I always do abs, arms, legs,  and then stretching if I have the time. You need to split up the abs and legs routine bc both are really intense ab workouts. The legs routine really works your lower core like no other. Lara is excellent at giving you breathing cues,  and making sure she utilizes your time wisely. There's no stopping to explain or chat about moves. She teaches as you go. I've owned this workout for years,  and there's still a few moves that I can't do,  so it's not exactly beginner material. Lara doesn't modify any of the moves,  but you can do that yourself or add in more of your favorites when she's doing something that's out of your range. If you're looking to lose weight,  this DVD delivers! Do this for a few weeks,  and you'll see changes. (Yes,  even if you can't do every move. And It will make you hella sore! Fair warning!) If you can hang in for a month or two,  you'll see dramatic weight loss. I know I did! This DVD was how I lost 30 lbs in two months before I went back to college. My copy is so worn out,  I'm having to buy another; it's that good!",1437091200,,1191,4.184210526315789
2606270,5,B000GEIRAU,Thanks!,1435276800,,7,7.0
2606271,5,B000GEIRAU,"This is a great workout DVD for the reluctant Pilates/yoga/stretching student. I prefer intense cardio exercises such as Insanity, T25, jogging, gym cardio machines, etc. to slower breathing/stretching-intensive workouts because I get bored easily; however I have noticed that these types of workouts tend to produce excellent results quickly. I picked up this DVD based on reviews and I'm very happy with both the workouts included and the results I've seen so far. I do the workouts individually or in pairs and find that the 10 or 20 minutes goes by very quickly and the workouts keep my interest. There are a few tough moves in each workout but nothing that the average person couldn't do or eventually work up to. Once you do each workout a couple of times you are able to focus more on your form and breathing and you'll feel stronger and more capable each time. You will need 1, 2, or 3 lb. dumbbells for the arm workout. I've been doing a lot of the same exercises for the past several months and my results have plateaued; however I've noticed some positive changes in my physique over the past few weeks which I attribute to doing each 10-minute workout once per week. I feel like my body benefits more from doing just 1 or 2 of these workouts vs. 30 min. of Insanity. Plus it's cheap and Prime-eligible.",1434326400,,1314,4.643776824034335

2606289,5,B000GEIRAU,"I absolutely LOVE that it comes with 10 minute videos and can easily add multiple together to make it as long or as short as you like. Sometimes all I have is 10 minutes but would like a good mild to moderate exercise. From the DVD home screen you can either select one program, or there is an option to select multiple programs. If you select mulitple it transitions from one to the other smoothly. I would recommend for beginners to intermediates.",1430092800,,449,4.487804878048781

2606292,5,B000GEIRAU,Fantastic!  I really enjoy most of the 10 minute solutions videos and this one tops my list of favorites.  The matrix menu allows you to select which segments you want to combine and personalize your workout based on time and needs. Laura is thorough in her instructions and is upbeat without being too perky or seeming insincere.  The moves are traditional pilates with a few creative twists to make it interesting.  I use this video in a rotation with a couple other videos I have and I'm seeing results.  Stick with it...you'll love it!,1428451200,,539,4.691489361702128

2606295,5,B000GEIRAU,"I really enjoy Lara Hudson's instruction. She doesn't waste a moment, is very informative, and never comes across judgemental.  You really feel like she is rooting for you. Her workouts are a series packed with 10 minute productive workouts. You can mix them up however you like. I highly recommend her other video ""10 minute Solution, Beginner Pilates."" It is a little more challenging than ""Rapid Results.""",1427155200,,408,5.08955223880597

Great instructor, some of the moves are a little difficult for a beginner but I keep trying and I'm getting better, and I can feel the entire workout in my body the next day which feels amazing!

Some of these moves feel awkward to me, whereas all the moves in the other 10 minute solution pilates DVD feel fluent and don't cause strain. I enjoy having both videos because I can rotate between them and they aren't that expensive. But I use the other one (it has a purple cover instead of green) probably 90% of the time, and mix this one in the other 10% of the time.

2606354,5,B000GEIRAU,I enjoy the way this video is set up into the 10 minute segments.  Each segment (5)  tones a specific area of the body - buns & thighs; arms & shoulders; waist; total body; and slim & stretch.  The whole video is 54 minutes but I like to skip around.

I also have the Tighten and Tone Pilates that uses the resistance band and I really like her as an instructor. I like workout DVDs that provide a challenge without being impossible. There are some moves I will have to work up to, but I like that as well. I usually do two or three segments at a time, and I definitely feel the work later. I am fairly new to Pilates, but Hudson's explanations are more than sufficient to instruct me in what I need to be doing, especially in terms of breathing.

2606392,2,B000GEIRAU,"This is my first 10 Minute Solutions Pilates DVD (I have one of their Belly Fat blaster DVDs) and after my first go, I must admit I am not very fond of the DVD. Here's why:

1. Due to the short workout times there are not a lot of repetitions so you won't see any real toning/slimming benefits if you only do one 10 minute workout at a time during each session (especially if this DVD is the only exercise you do). So selling the ""10 minute solution"" as the ideal solution for those with little time but who want to get fit/toned seems like an unrealistic promise. Having worked out consistently for the last 2 years, I find a workout length of around 40 to 60 minutes is where you'll see results in your body.

2. Lara exercises alone so there are no modifiers and because time is of the essence in these workouts she does not provide many modifications. This is fine if you are fit and have a strong core. Not so great if you are prone to neck tension (or other neck issues), have a weak core or back issues. I was not able to do many of the floor work due to neck tension and a weakish core - it's easier to pop my belly out rather than holding in my core going about my everyday so it's difficult for me to build the core muscles!

3. This DVD is more a mix of exercise types rather than a pure pilates workout as the title suggests.

4. I have attended live pilates workouts and would not recommend this to someone new to Pilates - although not pure pilates, this workout is more for the high intermediate or advanced (though an advanced person may use this for a light workout day). A person new to Pilates would not know the correct form/positioning to hold for the workouts and may even find the work out 'easy' which likely would mean they are doing it with incorrect form, makes it easy but there is no real benefit.

I have been spoiled by my collection of Ellen Barrett DVDs - the majority of which are about 45 minutes long and offer gentle yet effective fusion workouts. She always has modifiers so you can perform her workouts no matter what level you are at. Also Ellen's emphasis is on great form and controlled movements. Moving too fast means you are using momentum not muscle. Muscle is what you want to use to see any real results.

I purchased this DVD as I wanted a pure pilates workout which this is not.

Perhaps the 10 minute fast workout format is not for me. I will keep this to use at a later stage and look for a ""pure pilates"" workout and return to this once I am more advanced and have built up my neck & core strength .",1379462400,,2552,4.217213114754099
2606393,5,B000GEIRAU,"Since my attention usually wanes when doing a workout video, I love that this video is organized into 10 minute segments. Before I know it, I'm done with a segment, and I feel motivated to complete another one. One of the specific reasons I bought this video was because of the arm toning segment. I have always enjoyed pilates mat work, however these arm exercises are new to me. They are gentle enough that I can do the segment twice in a row, and hopefully they will be effective. Overall, I like this system. You can complete all of the segments and essentially have a complete pilates class, or pick and choose for targeted benefits.",1379116800,,638,4.556521739130435

You can do a little or a lot depending on what you choose & how much time you have.  I will note though that this is NOT ideal for someone brand new to Pilates.  There is not a lot of instruction on correct posture/breathing - which is essential for Pilates to be effective.  On the other hand, I enjoyed 10 full minutes of workout vs. the talking/instruction you get from other instructors.  If your new to Pilates, try Mary Windsor's Pilates and get comfortable with the ""how to"" then, come back for this...you'll love it.  My abs still hurt!!! (good pain!) :)",1365638400,,683,4.416

The perfect way to start getting your flat tummy back and strengthen your back after having a baby, and challenging enough to keep you in shape. I NEVER get sick of these videos (and I do  them a lot). Lara Hudson is my favorite video workout instructor because she is lovely to look at (not distractingly skinny or scarry muscular...just perfectly fit). She is motivating without being annoyingly peppy. Everything is perfectly explained as she is doing it, with reps counted, do's and don't described, and just enough ""Your Doing Great's"" to make you believe she's really there in the room with you.

2606420,5,B000GEIRAU,"I have Ankloying Spondilitis which is similar for me to arthritis. After taking a pilates course at a gym, this was a great substitution afterwards. Even if I use one 10 minute workout to stretch out I end the workout feeling calmer and more comfortable. It definitely helps achy muscles. The exercises that do work out your core ARE effective if you use slow, concise movements and proper form.

There is one move in this series I cannot do, but it is also on Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner dvds. I think it's due to my proportions or disease, but my hips and legs don't ever stack up properly.

This is an extremely convenient dvd. It will not shed pounds of fat, however, if it is the only thing used. It is more for getting in touch with your core muscles, relaxation, stretching, and great for days/nights in between intense workouts/cardio/circuit training.

Hand weights and mat rec. also",1363651200,,899,4.677215189873418

Like all workouts, you get out what you put in. If you keep your form, and use the resistance, it will work, you will feel the burn. I would say this for a short quick boost is perfect. If you want nasty butt kicking I would go with Turbo fire. I use this at work on my down time, and I love it.

I agree with other reviewers that you should have some experience with other pilates based workouts before attempting this workout. You will find yourself confused with the moves unless you've went through the motions in other beginner/intermediate type pilates workouts. At my fitness level, I was able to complete all of the moves successfully aside from 1 or 2, which I will need to continue building my muscle control in order to complete them.  I felt the burn the next day, it really works your muscles in all the right places. However, even when completing all of the sections in one workout session, I did not build up a sweat.

2606453,5,B000GEIRAU,"I have owned this dvd since college, about 6 years. Not only is it a great muscle workout, but because it is separated into 10 minute sections, it takes away the excuse that you don't have enough time to work out on any given day. I started out doing 3 sections from this dvd every other day, alternating with cardio and got in the best shape of my life. It was no doubt due to the fact that it was something I did consistently, as opposed to other things I've tried, like P90x, that are easy to drop once  you miss a day or two.

I would even suggest just doing the ab workout once a day in conjunction with whatever your other exercise is. I've also tried this method, and it flattened and tightened my stomach in a few weeks of doing it every day.

Even doing one section will leave you sweating and your muscles with that ""worked"" feeling. There are five, ten minute sections in this dvd-upper body, lower body, abs, total body, and stretch (not in that order persay). The sections allow you to mix and match based on what time you have and keep you from getting bored.

I wouldn't recommend doing ONLY this dvd to try and get in shape/maintain shape, because it has no cardio element. However, it's best to do cardio and muscle training on alternate days in order to give muscles a rest and a chance to repair and build, so it's perfect to use in conjunction with a cardio dvd/activity.

They are a great way to not only feel like the workout is doable, but also completely customizable to your mood, energy level, and timing EACH DAY. It breaks up the monotony of a routine and allows you to keep it fresh. Even when I decide I'm only going to do 3 10-minute segments, when I'm in it, I always end up doing more because, 'hey, what's another 10 minutes'? :)

Of the two Pilates 10 Minute Solution Videos I have, this one is my favorite. It's challenging yet doable. No matter what, a pose/stretch/movement is over within 8 counts/reps. Anyone can handle that. I feel great afterwards, especially when I end with the stretching segment. I've learned that no matter what segments I do, I always need to end with that one.

And last, I really like the instructor. I get REAL turned off by little things when it comes to people talking to me through a screen. And this gal is mellow, genuine, knowledgeable, and gives you great tips and explanation before and during each exercise.

I highly recommend this and you cannot beat the price!",1335744000,,1108,4.53
2606469,5,B000GEIRAU,"I started on her beginning Pilates, and after 2 weeks, transitioned to this. I have done this around 4 to 5 times a week for the last month, and find that I'm ready now for something different. That being said, it's a good DVD to get started on, and for alternating your routine. Pilates classes cost $20 and up a class, so to get a $10 DVD is a pretty good value at the end of the day. IMO it's good to have several dvd's that you can rotate to confuse your body, so it doesn't get used to just one routine. I really did not find this difficult at all, and after a month, have not seen ""rapid results"" but an overall strengthening in a very gentle way.

So, yes, I would recommend having this in your library.",1335657600,,710,4.107913669064748
2606470,5,B000GEIRAU,I can't say I lost weight doing this video because I wasn't dedicated to it. But it is a lot more fun than other videos. Since they have short '10 minute solutions' it's pretty good for busy people too.,1334275200,,202,4.205128205128205
2606471,5,B000GEIRAU,I purchased the 10 Minute Solutions a while back but I never used it. I needed to get in shape so that I could enlist in the Army and I decided to add this video to my workout routine. When I first started it I was totally out of shape. Everything in my body burned after I finished one of the segments. This video is something I've started doing in the mornings before I get my day started since it's only 10 minutes. I love this video because you can create your own workout that is designed to work on your trouble areas. This is an excellent video for anyone.,1334016000,,563,4.127272727272727
2606472,5,B000GEIRAU,"Love this DVD.  You can do a quick 10 minuets or several sets in one.  It looks kinda easy when you see her, but something that looks simple, get results in just a short 10 minute session.  Great if your just starting out or advanced enough to complete the whole DVD in one set.",1332806400,,278,4.111111111111111
2606473,3,B000GEIRAU,"This is what I was afraid of - it's to easy. Was I doing it wrong? Because after a week of working out to this DVD I  didn't feel any difference whatsoever. I'm used to feeling  pain when I switch a routine, feeling my muscles trying to recuperate after hard work. However, this system didn't do anything for me.
I guess, it's perfect for someone who has never exercised and wants to start slow.",1326758400,,395,4.324324324324325
2606474,4,B000GEIRAU,"As a casual pilates practicer, I was looking for DVDs that would give me the benefit of pilates without requiring too much outside knowledge or in-depth studying of the practice. This DVD definitely serves it's purpose; it's effective, you can feel the burn, it targets each and every part of the body, and there's enough diversity within the 5 workouts to keep you from getting bored. Aside from the instructor not being a favorite of mine, and some repetitiveness in the moves being used from workout to workout, I'd highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the lengthening & toning benefits of pilates, and especially to people limited on time to exercise.",1325203200,,668,4.920353982300885
2606475,5,B000GEIRAU,"I have many of the videos in the 10 minute solution series. As usual, this video is 5 ten minute segments. The first one works the buns and thighs, the second works the arms and shoulders, the third is abs, the fourth is an entire body workout, and the last one is a full body stretch. This video is VERY effective and innovative. The instructor (Lara Hudson) keeps you on your toes with some new killer exercises. The moves are fresh and challenging and they are mixed with some good old Pilates standbys, so not everything is unfamiliar. I think that this is definitely the most challenging Pilates video out of all the 10 minute solution Pilates series. It may even be the most challenging one that I own, period. This would be great for someone that is bored with the same old routines and wants some new inspiration or for the intermediate exerciser that is stuck in a rut and wants to really take it up a notch. I would highly recommend this, it is wonderfully effective- you really feel the burn and I am definitely sore the next day! A beginner may find some of these exercises too difficult, but she walks you through them and explains everything, so it is easy to follow along and you could just modify if you have to. This is now one of my favs!",1314057600,,1256,4.394849785407725
2606476,5,B000GEIRAU,"I should start by saying that I wasn't in good shape when I decided to get into pilates.  with that in mind, I really enjoyed this DVD.  It mixes pilates and yoga into fluid motions, and Lara is optimistic and encouraging.  the first time through, I felt like some of the exercises were a little fast, but after you go through the video once or twice and know what the moves are, you appreciate the pace.  at first I couldn't do all the exercises or all the reps.  (I said I was outta shape!) but I kept working at it and quickly improved.  So for me, the results were rapid.  I think the ""rapid"" title comes from the fact that you can stretch or workout all your muscles adequately in just ten minute segments.  If you are already toned and flexible, there might not be much more ""results"" to gain, but this is still a good all around DVD.  If you are out of shape, you might enjoy combining this with a basic beginners pilates video.  I did the basic video plus one segment of this to make a 30 minute workout.  Sometimes before bed I'll do the stretch section.  I find it to be very relaxing, although I modified the ""mermaid"" a bit as I found it to be stressful on my body like another reviewer mentioned.",1311811200,,1209,4.254385964912281
2606477,5,B000GEIRAU,I love using this workout dvd.  I use it several times a week and so far I feel much stronger;  now I can actually do what the instructor is doing and I feel great.  It helps that I get to choose or repeat which workouts to do and each workout is only ten minutes.,1307404800,,264,3.8518518518518516
2606488,5,B000GEIRAU,Great for people who don't have an extra hour in the morning to exercise.  I saw results in a little over a week!,1304640000,,113,3.9130434782608696
2606489,5,B000GEIRAU,"This was one of the first few pilates DVDs I tried, and it's one of the best. Lara Hudson cues so well and is encouraging and motivating without being overbearing or cheer-leadery.

This is a pilates fusion workout, so the traditional moves are intermixed with plie squats, yoga sequences, and conventional stretching exercises. It flows well from the beginning to end - I've done this DVD at least 20 times over the last three months and I still feel like I had a good workout at the end of it. My only complaint is that the abs segment feels somewhat easier than all the others, but that may be just my own unique imbalance of muscles.",1300752000,,637,4.491379310344827
2606490,5,B000GEIRAU,"Literally!  My bottom was sore after my first workout.  I love that each segment is 10 minutes long - so if you're short on time, you can just do one or two.  I love that the dvd lets you customize your workout - by choosing which exercises you do and the order you want to do them.  The moves themselves are simple enough to follow but do take time to perfect - especially if you're just starting out.  All in all - a good mat pilates dvd - it will have you sweating after just a couple of minutes!",1300060800,,499,4.0
2606491,3,B000GEIRAU,This gives you an alright work out but not the best. The other Lara Hudson pilates video (purple cover) is better.,1298937600,,114,4.476190476190476
2606492,5,B000GEIRAU,"I am an avid exerciser and have been for most of my life so I decided to try something different as I love to challenge myself.  Lara is an excellent instructor and this work out calms me while pushing me to a different level than my other routines.  I do the whole 50 minutes and am surprised at how much I sweat!  My muscles feel used but don't hurt and this is nice as I usually do high energy workouts that can be gruelling. I am very flexible so this work out is no problem for me but I can see that if you are not an intermediate this will be a challenge but keep on going as that is the only way to improve yourself.  Even if you can only do a few minutes keep at it and in a few months you will be surprised at how well you are doing.  This integrates Yoga, pilates and gymnastics and so I find it excellent for flexibility, toning and stamina and concentration.  Highly recommended.",1297987200,,891,4.091954022988506
2606493,4,B000GEIRAU,"I love the way the dvd is organized. You can choose one workout, play them all in order, or customize your own workout. Each segment is only ten minutes, but very effective. You can feel the target muscles fatiguing.",1294617600,,216,4.564102564102564
2606494,5,B000GEIRAU,"I like how this dvd is broken out into quick 10 minute sessions, each concentrating on a section of the body (lower, upper, core, fullbody etc). I usually use this dvd when I don't feel like working out but push myself to do ""just 10 minutes"" (heehee). I would pick a body section and go for it. Once I start, however, I start feeling pretty darn good. :) Its truely a good workout and you definately feel the burn (in a pleasant way). After I finish my first 10 minutes, I usually pick one or two others (love how that motivation picks up). If my truely pressed for time, the 10 minutes is honestly enough to make me feel like I had a good workout (compared to doing 10-20 minutes on the eliptical where I still feel like I haven't done enough - but thats cardio so I guess different).

Oh, I should also probably add that the insturctions are very well stated as well. I've never done pilates until I picked up this dvd and felt comfortable with the instructions.

Hope this helps in giving you a general feel of the dvd",1294272000,,1022,4.290155440414508
2606495,5,B000GEIRAU,"This DVD is excellent for anyone starting back into an exercise routine.  I had been lazy for a long time and this DVD jump started me back into a fitness lifestyle.  Lara is a great instructor and the 10 minute sessions helped me ease back into a routine.  Once I got confident, I added multiple segements to my workouts.  This is still my go to DVD.",1290297600,,351,4.2727272727272725

You can pick multiple 10 minute workouts, and put them in the order you'd like to do them, directly from the menu option of the DVD! This workout is a great start to my morning. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is experienced w/ pilates at an intermediate level.

FINALLY, after countless other discs that I haven't liked, I found this one.  I absolutely love it!!!  I love that I can create my own workout out of as many 10-min. workouts as I have time to do.  I loved this disc so much that I also bought the 10 Min. Solution Slim & Sculpt Pilates DVD w/ Pilates Band.  I love that DVD just as much.  Now with both DVD's I never get bored.

The time really goes by really fast, you can feel the exercises i0n your abs, legs, and arms...

I got all of this and more with Laura Hudson's Rapid Results.  The workout is not overwhelming to those just starting Pilates. Even though I've been doing Pilates for several years, I still like this workout.  As I become more flexible, I can perform the moves better and more effectively.",1278201600,,446,4.6075949367088604

I generally do all 5 of the 10 minute segments and my whole body definitely feels like it has been worked out at the end of it. Some of the moves are pretty challenging and if you are a beginner, you may not be able to do them. However, if you stick with it, you will be amazed at how much easier the moves become the more you do them. One of the best things about this video is if you don't have a lot of time to get a workout in, you can choose only 1 or 2 of the segments and still get a good workout.",1272758400,,617,3.717557251908397
2606513,5,B000GEIRAU,"What makes or breaks a workout DVD for me is the quality of the instructor - how clear are the directions and how well can I follow the moves? I appreciated the specificity of Lara Hudson's instruction; other Pilates (and yoga) DVDs I've done rattle off poses while the instructor moves into them, leaving me trying to flip the image in my head and figure out if that's her right or left leg that's forward and which arm is crossed which way. The instruction in this DVD was clear and easy to follow and specified right and left sides of the body, which is helpful when you're staring at a flat image on a screen and not an actual person.

There was a good amount of variety in the different workouts, which kept me interested and not bored. I'm relatively new to Pilates, though I do other toning and strength workouts on a regular basis, and I found the moves moderately challenging - some were easy, some were harder, and the workouts overall were manageable without being too easy or discouragingly difficult.",1271462400,,1013,4.565934065934066
2606514,5,B000GEIRAU,"I am a stay at home mom and I was looking for something that would give me the choice of what I want to work on. This is such a great DVD...the workout is divided into five parts concentrating on specific areas of the body. I get to choose what I want to focus on and for how long. I don't always have full 50 minutes to commit to the workout, so this works out great for me. The Ab workout is a killer...you actually feel the burn when you are doing the exercises. I have just started working out, so cannot comment on the results but I am positive that if I commit to doing this on a regular basis, I would be pleased. Lara Hudson is great...she keeps you engaged and motivated. Best DVD ever!!",1271203200,,696,4.087591240875913

It is easy to create a customized workout from the five 10 minute selections to target your individual goals of that day.  Even though each section in just 10 minutes, each seems very effective and you are done before it might get tedious.  Though based on Pilates, the moves are a bit different and therefore more interesting, especially for an experienced exerciser.  It's great to change it up.  Very creative and worthwhile.",1264896000,,503,4.870588235294117
2606528,5,B000GEIRAU,"I have three of the 10 Minute Solutions with Pilates. One with the ball, one with the stretchie band, and now this one. While I love all three, this one really is the deepest feeling of the routines. There is one 10 minute section that Lara suggests using 1,2 or 3# weights. I use the three #. Otherwise there are no other aides. Like the other two DVDs the sections have similar moves, and target areas. I use all three each week. This appears to be one of the first editions of the Pilates series. I enjoy both women as instructors. With all three I find that the more that I do them instead of getting easier, I practice my form and breathing and do it more to meet the instructions and deeper each time. I do Leslie Sansone walking DVDs first, then one of these DVDs. The Pilates really makes a difference with sculpting and firming. I hope this review helps.",1262995200,,863,4.333333333333333
2606529,2,B000GEIRAU,"I have to agree with some other reviewers that a number of moves on this DVD are unnecessarily complex. I recommend 10 Minute Solution: Pilates because you will feel the same burn with less maneuvering. There is not really a difference in the challenge level between the two DVDs. Regarding the workout on this DVD, there are new moves I haven't tried before, but I had no difficulty doing them. Like the 10 Minute Solution: Pilates DVD, I did not really feel challenged and only felt a burn during the ab workout. I've tried three different 10 Minute Solution DVDs, but I guess 10 minutes just isn't enough for me. If you are trying to lose weight, try 30-Day Shred. If you just want to maintain your shape and you are tight on time, this might be okay for you. I would not recommend this if you want to tone up your legs.",1262908800,,823,4.38562091503268

First, she is a plesant instructor and the 50 minutes flew by.  I don't know if doing only one set of an excercise is going to give me results as I am used to doing three sets of say 12 or 15 reps., yet I do feel the burn and the stretching is something I never do (I know not good!).  I could not do alot of moves as I am new to pilates so there is a challenge. I normally use 12 to 15 pounds for my arms and with the moves she does, I had to use NO weights at first and then just 3lbs. She has alot of muscle definition - is this from just these exercises?

There are no calve exercises so I will do my standard ones.  I will see if I get Rapid Results I am so wound up from doing too much lifting for so many years, I think this will help!",1249516800,,865,3.7252747252747254

Each segment is tough enough on its own, so if I only have 20 or 30 minutes, this is the dvd I pop in. I'm a huge fan of Lara Hudson as an instructor - she's very precise and explains the movements well. However, I would not recommend this video if you have never done Pilates before. Get her other video, the regular 10-Minute Solution Pilates, and familiarize yourself with the Pilates moves there first, then come to this video when you are ready for a real challenge.",1245801600,,637,4.2727272727272725

Some people it won't apply to, but if you have a sensitive back, BE CAREFUL with the ""rollover"" exercise!  The backlash of it can hit you a day or two afterward and you may not know what hit you. I kept thinking I could work up to it, but then later OUCH!
Also-I do not like the last stretch segment. It's more of another workout and does not do enough to simply stretch you out.

The only exercises I am not completely sold on are the leg ones...but those are my problem areas and I have always done squats and lunges in the past. Otherwise,  i love this DVD...if I'm being a bum I always just tell myself...just do a 10 minute segment...and next thing you know you're doing another!! so i end up getting more workout time in. I only wish i could figure out a better way to see what she is doing so i don't have to strain my neck or keep pausing.

2606572,4,B000GEIRAU,This DVD is great...I love Laura Hudson and have used her other DVD's in the past. This workout is very challenging and probably not for beginners but great for those who are bored with all the standard pilates moves. I also LOVE the 10 minute solution series because you can really tailor your workout to the amount of time you have on a given day.,1236384000,,349,4.384615384615385
2606573,5,B000GEIRAU,"Before I got this DVD, I was not aware how great pilates is!  Lara is great too.  The workouts really isolate the muscle you are working on.  I highly recommend to anyone who wants to get the most for their time.",1235347200,,212,4.121951219512195

It's all resistance - using your own body weight. You won't get any cardio benefits and you won't ache the next day like a strength routine. Good if you're really sore and need an easy day. I like the routines on this one better than the regular 10 minute pilats - more interesting and not as basic.",1235347200,,455,4.428571428571429

2606576,5,B000GEIRAU,This is a great DVD if you are looking for shorter effective work outs. 10 minutes just hits the spot and you can pick and choose what body part you would like to work out. You will feel muscles hurting you didn't even know existed after the first few work outs. A fresh way to reintroduce Pilates.,1234569600,,298,4.245614035087719
2606577,4,B000GEIRAU,"What sold me on this DVD was the fact the workouts were broken up into 10-minute segments. Many days, 10 minutes is all I have to myself. If I am lucky and my two kids nap at the same time, I might get 30-40 minutes. Either way, I have enough time to do part of this DVD. I have to say the first few times I did the DVD it kicked my a$$. But I did feel it working. I have now been doing it for a month and I definitely feel a difference. My post-pregnancy gut does not stick out quite as far. I still have a long way to go before I reach my weight-loss goals, but I enjoy doing this workout and that is a big plus in keeping me motivated. I think I am even becoming addicted to this DVD. It really gives you a workout, but is much easier on the body than running. There are still parts of the DVD I cannot come close to doing. I think only Gumby and the woman on the DVD are flexible enough to do those moves, but I would still totally recommend this it. FYI, also having a yoga mat is a must.",1233878400,,993,3.825242718446602

What I love most about this DVD is that the five segments are designed for a specific area or for a certain need (abs, arms, buns/thighs, cardio, and stretching) and you can mix and match, or do all five. I usually do the abs and buns/thighs segments, and end with the stretching, which is very relaxing and great way to end a workout.

The instructor is great, she gives great breathing cues and makes the exercises easy to follow, even for a beginner. The workouts are fun, easy to stick to, and believe me, you'll get the results you want!",1232668800,,756,4.3546099290780145
2606590,4,B000GEIRAU,"I like this video a lot, though there are a lot of pilates moves that are mechanically really challenging if not impossible for me, and it's not the safest way for me to exercise right now. I have a big chest, big hips, and I don't think my center of gravity works the same as these dancers'! I know if I lost 15 or 20 pounds, it would all be easier, but I still suspect I'd face some serious difficulty with it. Anyhow - I really like strong stretch and I like the challenge in a lot of this, so I just pace myself and modify throughout. If you have back issues or haven't done much to build up your core strength already, I'd suggest waiting to try this sort of workout till you're stronger, and going pretty carefully when you do.",1232150400,,733,4.169014084507042

I have now started including the Total Body Blast workout and the Slim & Sleek Stretch. I am really enjoying this workout. I have done Yoga a few times, and wasn't sure if I liked it, but I've been wanting to slim my stomach and tone up. I can already feel it working, and I can feel the use of muscles I haven't used before in working out. I have leg & knee problems, and this workout doesn't place strain on my injuries! I am going to get some light hand weights and then start using the Arm & Shoulder Shaper, I can't wait!",1231977600,,660,4.0458015267175576
2606592,5,B000GEIRAU,The arms workout is awesome. You feel that you are making a difference in the first few minutes. I always look for workout for my busy schedule as well as something I can do with my young children in the room who always pick my exercise time to want to be picked up.

After all how many times have we all bought something thinking it was going to be good, only to be disappointed later? Well anyway, after just using it a few times I really liked it. The moves are challenging without being impossible, especially for a beginner. The DVD comes in different segments according to goal and body part. Some of these segments include arms, buns and thighs, a super-stretch,full body workout, abs, ect. Anyway, later on, as you build up endurance and muscle, I don't see why you couldn't do each segment two or three times even. So far I like it , the instructor is motivating without being annoying. I give it five stars because it's the only workout DVD I've actually bought, liked, and used, and planned on using again.",1226793600,,887,4.620253164556962

2606597,5,B000GEIRAU,"I have been doing these exercises for the past couple of months and totally love it! the instructions are easy to follow (and very important, especially for breathing). Initially I was doing the whole set of 5 10-minute exrecises (very challenging for beginners). Then I picked 3 - buns and thighs, waist slimmer and total body blast and works just fine. Sometimes I do either buns and thighs or waist slimmer (just for ten minutes) - and it still helps a little to get you in shape.

People who do not know about pilates should learn more before ordering this DVD. I was telling my friend how much I enjoyed it and when she watched the DVD she said she could not believe that the slow movements can get you nice and slim.. so, do not expect aerobics and a lot of jumping from this DVD, you do need to concentrate on your movements and breathing - but it is very effective, and far more efective than simple aerobics. After I am done with the workout, I always feel great and happy!",1221523200,,982,4.395604395604396

No situps!  Next I enjoy working the arms and shoulders.  I recommend this DVD to anyone!,1213920000,,262,4.22

2606614,4,B000GEIRAU,"I do the ten minute waist line slimmer portion of this video at least five nights a week and have been doing so for the past six weeks.  I just had my second baby and am in much need of some waist slimming exercises.  Although I don't have rock hard abs or anything close as of yet, I do notice my stomach getting flatter by the week and I feel really good after each work out.  I am now four pounds below my pre-pregnancy weight thanks to watching what I eat, doing my pilates every night, and walking when I can.  After I lose another 7 pounds or so (getting back down to my optimal weight - I wasn't there before I had baby #2!), I'm confident I can get my belly into good shape using this video.

It is very easy for me to squeeze in the ten minutes it takes to do that abs section at the end of my day.  Sometimes I throw in another workout as well, if I have the time and energy.  Eventually, I'd like to find the time to do the whole video (50 minutes) three times a week at least or at the very least the waist slimmer portion twice a day every day.

I highly recommend this video, especially to moms who have limited time in their day.

I have never really done pilates before.  I am a beginner and I find I can do 90% of the exercises just fine.  For those that I can't, I modify them.",1211846400,,1295,3.9806201550387597

It's especially good if you can't afford taking pilates classes - this DVD is just as good!!,1210204800,,399,3.6705882352941175

This has many moves that seem to be more yoga inspired than pilates.  The movements are done more quickly and not as controlled as I would like.  I had not done any conditioning in several months and many of the movements I could not do at all.  The instructor also does not give advise for modifications.

That said, I do like the idea of choosing between several 10 minute workouts.  Also, even though I did my own modifications of several movements, I still felt like I got a good workout.

Overall, a good conditioning DVD if you don't have a lot of time and are already in fairly good shape already.  I would not recommend it for beginners or anyone looking for a strictly Pilates workout.",1206489600,,830,4.407894736842105

You can program the DVD to play any of the five sessions in any order you prefer!

I definitely recommend this to others who want something that will give them results in a short amount of time.  After only a few days my muscles were noticably toned and more flexible In addition, the tightness I get from working and stress dissappeared after each workout.

I am one of those people who workout for a few months, take a break for a few months, and then get back on it because of my schedule and so on (yeah, make excuses!)  So, for people who aren't super dedicated to working out, this is a very good video to get you back on track (make those muscles to remember who is boss).  That's not to say that this video is easy, by any means.  It is actually very challenging and requires tons of focus.

I am a newcomer to pilates, and although this video is not a pure ""pilates"" workout, as there are modifications with weights and so on, the video works up a sweat in just one of the 10 minute segments.  I had a blast doing all the 10 minute segments.  Each segment seems to fly by.  Believe me, I'm feeling the workout (I'm drenched in good ol' sweat by the third 10 minute segment).  The video instructor tells you how to breathe, which is extremely important, and gives very detailed instructions.  I had no problem learning the exercises the first time I tried the video. My muscles are already becoming toned and I've only been using it for two weeks, three times a week (with no other exercises).  I love, love, love this video!

But that's really it...  Overall, I think I feel worse.  My back hurts from some of the poses and my knees actually hurt too from some of the leg exercises.  The instructer moves WAY too fast and doesn't really instruct how to do the poses properly.  I think the stretching segment is the worst because it's way too fast.  You end up rushing through and I feel like I'm pulling my muscles and not stretching them.  I always thought that stretching should be a slower process...

I'm in really good shape -- it usually takes 15 minutes of hard work on a treadmill or eliptical to get me to sweat - and this video does it in about the same amount of time!

2606656,2,B000GEIRAU,I feel strange expressing my discontent with this dvd among so many stellar reviews.  The test of whether I like an exercise dvd has much to do with the instructor.  I find her delivery unappealing.,1191196800,,198,4.628571428571429
2606657,5,B000GEIRAU,"Target some serious work on your butt, thighs and abs!! I LOVE this DVD, and Ms Lara is awesome.  She somehow keeps me motivated when my muscles are screaming.  It's quick enough for me to do on lunch break, and the results were pretty quick.  I saw a difference within three weeks.  It puts Buns of Steel to shame!! :-)",1189468800,,320,4.283333333333333
2606668,5,B000GEIRAU,"This DVD is great for anyone who hates to exercise.  You can choose from five different 10 minute programs if you're short on time, or can do them all at once.  I've only been doing this for about three weeks, but can already see results.",1189382400,,238,4.266666666666667
2606669,5,B000GEIRAU,"No, this DVD is not for beginners.  It is proabale more appropriate for intermediate level pilates exercisers and up.  The 10 minute segments are all very well done, the cuing is excellent, and laura's form is very good.  The stretch segment is fantastic.",1189036800,,255,4.883720930232558
2606670,5,B000GEIRAU,"Effective dvd. Challenging but that is exactly what I was looking for.  Just used for approximately three weeks and already can see feel and see improvement (better walking position, stronger core, better waistline).  I haven't work out for about two years so some sections are more difficult but that is exactly what I need ""the challenge"".  Also, it feels like I getting one-on-one attention with her direct instruction.",1188172800,,422,5.176470588235294
2606671,4,B000GEIRAU,This seems like it will be good once I can master all the moves. Some of it I can follow and do and some of it is challenging. I will probably keep at it. I especially like the fact the you can choose the work outs one at a time.,1187827200,,229,3.6
2606672,5,B000GEIRAU,I really like this workout DVD.  She makes the workouts interesting and really makes you work your whole body.  I especially like the feature where you can tailor your own workout - that way you can do lower body one day and upper body the next.,1186358400,,245,4.304347826086956

You can choose any 10 minute segment to focus on a specific body part, choose the 10 minute segment that is a total body workout, or do them all.  I work out regularly, including cardio and weight training, and I found the exercises on this tape to be quite demanding.  I would highly recommend it for any level.",1186272000,,401,4.32

2606675,5,B000GEIRAU,"is the best feature on this DVD.  It gives me the flexibility to either complete the DVD in its entirety but in the order that I choose or I can create a 30 minute workout, depending on the time I have available and the areas that I am more interested in targeting.  After the 10 minutes in each segment I at least feel satisfied that the particular area did receive a decent workout.",1184284800,,384,4.2465753424657535

I like it.",1184025600,,304,3.765625

I've never felt comfortable working out in front of my husband, but not only do I do this in front of him, but he does it with me and it whips both of our butts! We look like dorks and grunt and laugh the whole way, but it feels good and I must say I'm proud of myself. 10 minutes is manageable! I have no excuse with this! The great thing is you can do as many 10 minute segments that you want, there are 5 to choose from. I always do more than 10 minutes, so I must say this is a great way to get into a routine!",1183593600,,683,3.717241379310345
2606688,4,B000GEIRAU,"Got this to try something new and wanted to work on my flexability.  Good for light days or days you want to focus on abs and stretching. Only thing I really wish is that she would cue better on the breathing. There are parts that she focuses really well on it or makes it very obvious whether you should be inhaling or exhaling, and then there are others that she moves very quickly through and doesn't give quite enough instruction on breathing or the beginner modifications.  Overall not bad for what it is.  Has potential once I get more aquainted with proper breathing and moves.",1182124800,,584,4.542857142857143

I love that I can set up my own workout if I want to do certain areas one day or do the whole thing if I have the time and energy. For me, there are also some really different exercises and stretches, not the same old stuff I've been doing. I highly recommend it.",1181779200,,368,3.8552631578947367
2606691,4,B000GEIRAU,"I've never ever done pilates, so I have to say that this was a bumpy start.  She goes a little fast, so I recommend that the viewer watch the segment first and then do it.  But this being nitpicky.  I love the 10 minute solution series because it allows me to customize my workout and I can try new things in small amounts.  The instructor is great, and the workouts themselves are productive without being painfully strenuous.  The best part is that I can feel the results and I'm not bored!",1180137600,,492,4.362637362637362
2606692,4,B000GEIRAU,"I decided to purchase this DVD based on the reviews of a bunch of different pilates videos.  This one seemed to have the most positive feedback, and was simple enough, yet offered enough workouts to get a good quality session.  For a first time user of pilates, this was all new to me.  Lara does give good instructions, and after a few times doing the workouts, it seemed much easier to follow.

The butt and thigh workout is probably the easiest and the best, and gives you a guarenteed burn, especially at the end.  My inner thighs look awesome--I can see the definition just in raising my leg!  However, I am lacking the rounder-rear that I thought I would get, but I can say it isn't floppy anymore!  The complete body workout is DEFINITLY a good workout--I worked up a good sweat, but it's kind of hard to follow for a beginner (there are moves and motions that make it hard to look at the TV).  The abs workout is alight, but not great.  I'm not seeing the desired results in my problem ""pouch"" area, and the part about turning the tailbone under is confusing.  The stretch workout is very relaxing too.

I would recommened watching the DVD first, or follow along with the remote near you to pause and rewind the first go-round and without the expectation of getting a good workout.  The instructions are pretty simple, great for a first timer.  I like how she tells you how and where to breath, and after 2 or 3 times, the movements become second nature.  FIRST TIMERS--I would definitly advise to have a cushioned mat of some sort when doing this!  I made the mistake of not having one, and there were certain parts that were a little painful to do on just a hard floor--I had to use a pillow to cushion my rear and tailbone.  Overall, it serves it purpose as a beginners video, and the option to customize your workout is another perk.  I would recommend this to someone just starting out with pilates or someone looking for an easy way to get thinner thighs, as that is the part where I have seen the best results.",1179532800,,2025,4.42972972972973
2606693,4,B000GEIRAU,"I like this DVD alot.  She has some great moves.  I don't really care for the 10 minute intervals, I would prefer to stay doing pilates the entire time but for those who only have 10 minutes than I can see them liking this.  The only thing she is missing is some sort of warm up.  I usually walk for 30 minutes first than go directly to this DVD, works well for stretching after doing cardio.",1179100800,,392,4.118421052631579
2606694,5,B000GEIRAU,"I don't know anything about pilates...i.e. never did it before or even read about it, and this is also my first exercise DVD. I usually just make up my own thing. Anyway, I was looking for a workout that gave me a leaner look and this one has done it! It's also given me some really defined muscles and I'm much more flexible which is a nice plus. My favourite move of all is the 'triceps dip to a tabletop' and I sometimes use this as a relaxer! The exercises weren't too hard for me but that doesn't mean that they're easy! I came out of my first 10 minutes really sweating! I don't have a fitness background but I am not overweight I just needed to tone up. If you are a pilates pro you may find this easy and if you are overweight or very unfit it may be a bit tougher but just take it slow at your own pace until you are more comfortable with the exercises. There are some moves in here that can pull a muscle if you're not careful! I would recommend having a look at the DVD before using it for the first time so you know what to expect. Also there is nothing wrong with stopping the player and repeating a move or doing additional reps of it if you like. For the 10 minutes provided there is such a lot to do that high reps are not a priority.

Lara uses a great variety of moves that can be incorporated into your own home workout if you're into mixing and matching. This is a DEFinite must buy!",1178409600,,1403,4.064981949458484

I have tried more than once, but if I am not at the top of my game physically and mentally, I cannot complete a single set. And with two small children, I often come to the mat preoccupied and tired.

To call it a Pilates DVD borders on false advertising. Maybe 20% of the content is bastardized Pilates, while the rest is a mish-mash of yoga, calisthenics, and weightlifting moves.

2606711,5,B000GEIRAU,"Want to get fit, but don't feel like jumping around or making with a ton of equipment or feeling like other people are staring at you? Give this one a shot. It's definitely worth the money.

Set in a calm, slow environment, this one-on-one style set-up is really very cool. In the arm segment, you use 1 to 3 pound handweights, but otherwise, you use your body's own weight for resistance.

The thing about this DVD that I like is that the burn tends to sneak up on you. You do a couple of reps of something and feel fine. Another couple of reps and you're going, ""Whoaaaa, Momma, I can feel the burn now.""

As this is my first fitness DVD, I'd say it's good for beginners. I've had no injuries or weaknesses, and have thus far lost about 2 inches off my waist, after doing it for a month.

I do, however, suggest that you go into the lovely programming section (I LOVE this feature) and select the Body Blast to do first. It starts simply, and gets your body warmed up for the other segments.

Good luck!",1174521600,,1005,4.268421052631579

2606713,5,B000GEIRAU,I have the original 10 minute Solution Pilates video and loved it. I read about Rapid Results in Health Magazine and Fitness Magazine so I decided to get it.

When i have time (2x/week), i do all 5 workouts, otherwise,  1 or 2 at a time and mix them up.

I've been doing Pilates for 12 years at studios as well as at home...i like this dvd.  I can't afford a gym membership, but who needs one when you can do this plus other exercise dvd's at home!!

Some of the exercises were hard at first... but every day, and I'm only doing ten to twenty minutes per day, I am getting stronger and better at the exercises...

I always finish with Sleek and Stretch which feels great.  I really feel it after and feel much better instantly!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the Total Body Blast segment involves some moves and transitions that take some time to get into and the transition is a little quick for me to keep up with.

Great instructor, who moves through the exercises smoothly. I still have to work on the exercises just to get them right as I'm no more the most flexible and fit person. But for athletes and people who do pilates this work-out should not be a problem.

I love challenges and hope that soon I can master it.

2606743,3,B000GEIRAU,"I didn't really love any of the segments (the DVD is broken up into five 10 minute segments). They were all just ok. I didn't like the wide range of experience needed throughout one 10-minute segment. For example, in the abs section, the first few minutes felt like nothing. I didn't feel like I was working my abs at all. Then the last move was something I couldn't even do properly. Another problem was that Lara (the instructor) didn't have very good breathing cues. Sometimes, she would make obvious exhales during the exercise so you know when to inhale and exhale (which is very important in pilates). But with some exercises, where only 3 or 4 reps were done, she would just talk the whole time. Also, you definitely need some sort of cushion for your knees, hips, and shoulders for most of the exercises. I recommend a yoga/pilates mat, and using only 2-3 lb. hand weights for the arm section (even if you can do curls and stuff with 5 or 8 lb. hand weights, the modifications in this DVD are too tiring w/the heavier weights). Most importantly, watch the DVD once or twice to learn the moves first, otherwise you'll feel too overwhelmed trying to learn the correct form and feel the workout.

You can feel the results almost immediately and I can tell I'm really toning up.  I usually rotate between doing abs and arms one evening and buns & thighs and flexibility the next.  If you are considering buying this DVD- go for it!  It's worth every penny!",1169769600,,583,4.443396226415095
2606746,5,B000GEIRAU,"I had been wondering about Pilates for quite some time, but was always shy about taking an actual class with all those semi-pro pilates students.  This DVD was the perfect solution.  It allowed me to learn at my own pace without feeling stupid.  And the workout is GREAT.",1169510400,,271,4.604166666666667
2606747,5,B000GEIRAU,"I enjoy the format of 5 different workouts. I mix it up and do 2-3 every day. I am new to Pilates, having taken one mat class, and think that the instructor on the DVD is excellent. She explains breathing and position very well.",1168214400,,228,4.204545454545454
2606758,5,B000GEIRAU,"I've had a few different pilates DVDs and this one is the best. It really helps that the instructor tells you when to breath in and out and you can hear her breathing. You can synchronize the 5 different workouts in the order you want. Some of these exercises are different from the ones on other pilates DVDs. For example, I've never seen the teaser on any other workout. It's my favorite. I have used Winsor Pilates and I used to think it was great, but it really hurt my neck compared to this one. This 10 Minute Solution Pilates doesn't hurt and it really works DEEP into your muscles. I think I can replace weight lifting with this DVD.",1166659200,,641,4.35
2606759,5,B000GEIRAU,"I bought this DVD after taking a pilates class with the pilates machines, so I was familiar with some of the mat moves throughout the five 10-minute sections.  My pilates teacher told me that if I purchase ANY pilates DVD to supplement the pilates/machines class, the best way to do it is this:

1 - Review the move according to the teacher and practice it once.

2 - Pause the DVD.

3 - Do the move AT YOUR OWN PACE and AT YOUR OWN LEVEL.

4 - Do not try to keep up with the teacher.

After 4-6 sessions on the DVD, you should be able to do the moves SLOWLY, but WITH STRENGTH and BETTER CONCENTRATION  - AT YOUR OWN PACE, even if it takes you longer than the prescribed 10 minutes.

If you try to keep up with Lara - you could end up inflaming your lower back, or straining your neck.

You have to ask yourself - what's my goal?

To get stronger?

Or to get it over with in 10 minutes?",1162166400,,887,4.011428571428572
2606760,5,B000GEIRAU,"I really like this DVD - you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes.  Lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises, and she moves quickly from one exercise to another.  I like the variety of exercises - there are not too many rep's on any one exercise, which keeps the workout from being monotonous.

This is the first ""programmable"" exercise DVD I've used, and I like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order - this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start (and once I start, I'm fine).",1161907200,,569,4.4
2606761,5,B000GEIRAU,"I had tried one other pilates dvd and didn't like it but since I enjoyed other 10 Minute Solution dvds I thought I would give this one a try and I am so glad I did! The time flew by for each segment and I really enjoyed Lara as an instructor. You also add hand weights to some segments which is nice. In fact the only equipment needed was a carpeted floor or pilates mat, and light hand weights. Plus you are able to do this workout bare foot, a nice change of pace. My only complaint is that I could not do all the moves in the cardio segment, too advanced for me but hopefully in time I will increase my flexibiity. I highly recommend this dvd for an intro to pilates or for those already at intermediate levels. I found it relaxing but could feel the burn afterwards.",1158364800,,770,4.14
2606762,5,B000GEIRAU,"This workout DVD is fabulous- I love how its broken down into 10 minute segments so that you can customize it depending on your time constraints a/o fitness needs, or can do the whole thing for one terrific workout!

What makes this DVD better than some of the other pilates DVD's on the market is: (1) very good breathing and technique cues (SO important); (2) instruction while doing the moves as opposed to wasting time explaining what you're going to be doing (so that you're actually moving for all 10 minutes of each segment); (3) really rigorous segments- you'll work up a sweat in just ten minutes no matter which one(s) you do; (4) short reps which really focus in on technique and doing the moves the right way to reach results; (5) some new and interesting moves- not merely the same old ones you see on every other DVD out there; (6) NO excuses allowed- everyone can find just 10 extra minutes at the very least to squeeze in a great workout; and (7) something for everyone- whether you're looking to tone your core, arms, hips, butt or legs, you'll find a great workout.

If you're new to pilates, you may want to watch it first before attempting to follow it to make it easier, as the moves a/o techniques may be new to you.

My only gripe is that she recommends doing exercises- particualrly in the ""core"" segment- with a rounded back and not in neutral pelvis position (which I've been taught is the correct pilates position). Apart from that one complaint, its an awesome workout and you'll feel it the next day whether you do one segment or all of them!",1158278400,,1571,4.524647887323944
2606763,5,B000GEIRAU,"I knew I'd like this - I have Lara's 2 other videos and I like her style.  She cues well and has a nice, calm demeanor. Rapid Results is different from her other pilates video. In this there are pilates classics with a twist.  In the arms section you'll do saw with weights in both hands.  I really felt that all over.  The bun/thighs section has floor exercises: frog, bridge and side lying leg lifts with lots of leg variations.  The abs section was very effective.  Again, leg variations make you really feel it in your lower abs.  The total body section was tough and I also felt like the stretch was a workout!  If you like variety over endless reps you'll love this workout.  It's not the same old pilates moves.  Lara doesn't show many modifications; but I don't think this was meant for beginners.  It's a fluid workout and I was challenged by each 10 minute section.",1155513600,,875,4.440251572327044
2606764,5,B000GEIRAU,"These workouts are so good in the respect that they don't allow you any excuses.  EVERYONE can find 10 minutes - and more often than not, after the first 10 minutes you find the energy to turn that into 20 or 30 minutes.

This workout is a little more fast paced than other Pilates dvds I've done, but it still uses the classic moves.  As usual, each 10 minute routine focuses on a specific body part (first is buns/thighs, second is arms/shoulders, third abs, fourth a total toning and lastly a stretch).  The instructor Lara Hudson, is a good cuer and so you know what's coming up next and are always prepared.  They do use weights so you should have some nearby.

I love this dvd.  I've only done it once through once, because I just got it, but I intend to use it about twice a week along with the other workouts of theirs.  It's easy to get through because of the time and it's fun and different.  I recommend it for sure.",1154736000,,927,4.281609195402299

8131182,5,B000GEIRAU,"I love these 10 Minute Solution videos! The guidance is great and it's easy to choose which one-or more- of the 10 minute workouts to use.  A perfect way to get back into exercise on a busy schedule without straining or overdoing it.  Lara is positive and pleasant without being overly chipper, too.",1524960000,,299,4.622641509433962
