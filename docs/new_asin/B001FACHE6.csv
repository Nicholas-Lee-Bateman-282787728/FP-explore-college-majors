3566523,3,B001FACHE6,"This is a National Geographic film, which means it is remarkably even-handed. I'm a long-time admirer of National Geographic. In this case, two young men, brothers, with charming accents (never did catch where they are from; eastern Europe, perhaps) spent a whole day with each of about a dozen major religious leaders: the Dalai Lama, the Pope, the head of the Southern Baptists, and of the Lutherans, a Hindu female guru, an important Shinto priest, two or three varieties of Muslims, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Rabbi of Jerusalem. They followed their typical day, they asked them questions, and gave them an opportunity to express their beliefs on a variety of subjects.

The most striking thing about the film is the extent to which these great leaders agree with one another. Sure, the details vary, but the essence of what they are saying is the need for love and compassion, enjoying our differences and celebrating our similarities. From an atheist's perspective, one cannot imagine where all the hate and nastiness come from when there are these obviously good and wise people heading up the major religions of the world.

It's a puzzlement.",1336867200,3,1157,5.020833333333333
3566524,4,B001FACHE6,"Great Dvd, very well done.  I used it for teaching a class, wish it were set up a little differently with certain breaks to help with it as a teaching tool, but great.",1266624000,2,167,4.0606060606060606
3566525,5,B001FACHE6,This was something our adult education class at church was interested in. It is thoughtful and sensitive to the value of the religions covered on the DVD.,1257379200,,154,4.7407407407407405
3566526,5,B001FACHE6,"In reviewing this documentary, a follow-up to their personal experiences on 9/11, Jules and Gedeon Naudet seek to answer the spiritual questions that resulted from their presence during and after 9/11.  Although approached with a kind of naivete, the innocense of the questions put to the great spiritual leaders of our time were true gifts of wisdom and insight into the different faiths of the world and the comman thread of humanity that still can be found.  This documentary was not widely viewed, but the subtle message of hope, the belief in a power greater than ourselves, the ingenuity and the persistance of faith by all concerned was at once touching and overwhelming in it's scope.  I know of no other documentary that approached these great spiritual leaders with questions that men of little or no faith would always want to ask.  Moving aside ""political"" correctness, these leaders tell stories of persecution and persistance in the face of hate, ignorance and personal strife.  I appreciated the fact that no conclusion or resolution to one particular faith is highlighted or glorified, but rather, the documentary speaks for itself in showing the difficulty of true faith in the face of man's inhumanity to man. I highly recommend this history lesson, mostly because I feel it will be a forgotten or little used tool for teaching the philosophies and belief systems prevalent in our society today. It is a masterful accounting of the true search for the face of God.",1252368000,9,1482,4.983805668016195
3566527,1,B001FACHE6,"National Geographic is well known for its pictorial brilliance, and this film doesn't lack in that area, but I made the mistake of not considering what it cost to gain the access required to make it. A little more journalistic independence and integrity would have made for a more honest portrayal in a least some cases. I found the gratuitous anti-Americanism and hypocrisy a little hard to swallow. Nice visuals though.",1232236800,4,421,4.943661971830986
3566528,5,B001FACHE6,A well done documentary with the current world's religious leaders: interesting questions and honest answers- offers a rare insight into the private lives and thoughts of these important leaders of today.,1229731200,8,204,5.612903225806452
3566529,5,B001FACHE6,"I saw this when it played on network television. It was an intelligent and respectful treatment of the subject of comparative religion. The treatment was surprisingly respectful as current mass media products go, and not excessively concerned with political correctness. Worthwhile and well done.",1229212800,10,296,5.75
8301475,5,B001FACHE6,"I cannot say enough good things for this documentary. We need to be showing it in every neighborhood in this country to counter the divisive, bigoted, hateful behavior that has done so much damage to our nation the past months. Spiritual leaders from all faiths, from all countries, from all races take us back to the basics of spiritual truth. It is one of the best I have ever seen.",1493424000,,384,4.5

8301478,5,B001FACHE6,"Amazing film about how twelve of the greatest spiritual leaders from various world religious traditions respond to all of the BIG QUESTIONS that arose after September 11.  I use this film as an introduction to the World Religions classes I teach at my church and at the university where I teach.

8301481,5,B001FACHE6,"In teaching World Religions at both high school and college levels, this video is excellent as an introduction to the topic of religion and the diversity of belief, practice and experience that exists in the contemporary world.  By following religious leaders from a wide array of traditions (Hindu, Buddhist, Shinto, Jewish, Christian and Muslim), the film handles the topic objectively and treats every tradition with respect. Care has been taken to include Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant Christian perspectives, as well as those of both Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims.

The filmmakers' approach indirectly addresses common misconceptions and stereotypes that fuel religious hatred, emphasizing our common humanity. The film encourages respectful dialogue as a path to peace in our fractured world, and it offers a thoughtful vehicle for beginning the process of education needed for such dialogue.",1411948800,3,904,5.639705882352941
8301482,5,B001FACHE6,"This documentary is a very pleasant one. I love it when I see world leaders all united for peace. It doesn't matter what you believe, if your beliefs doesn't bring peace to a world of perpetual chaos. The bottome line, love, love, and love people all the more as we are all created differently, but equal.",1401840000,,305,4.464285714285714
8301483,5,B001FACHE6,"I watched it on PBS years ago and felt inspired.  Just bought the DVD, watched it again, and am again filled with hope.
This video is wonderful for what it manages to show in 90 minutes --- the common humanity of the leaders, the teachings of love and respect for each other, and reverence for God/Truth that are the hallmarks of all religions.  Nowadays, when differences and violence are making so many headlines, it's heart-warming to be reminded of what we humans have in common, to see that leaders across traditions recognize this.  In 90 short minutes, this movie manages to touch on some of the more difficult questions of life.  There's much, much more that could be explored --- for that, we would need (and I would love to have) a series of movies.",1375142400,,759,4.6
8301484,2,B001FACHE6,"I expected something different than what I got.  The story line is a set of video clips from the personal lives of church / religious leaders.  It doesn't really deal with the question of religious movements taking some kind of social action against whatever evil they have identified.  And it doesn't deal with the question of why bad things happen to good people (i.e., God's role in natural disasters).  For what it is, the presentation is choppy (jumping around in the lives of one of the twelve luminaries to another) and develops slowly, more like you'd expect of an art piece than a documentary.  I know more now about how much effort is expended by such leaders in putting on the vestments of their office, or walking down hallways of famous buildings, or seeing crowds of adoring followers from the stage.",1373328000,,814,4.74468085106383
