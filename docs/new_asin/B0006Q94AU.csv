2191156,4,B0006Q94AU,this was an interesting story to watch especially with it being a true story and that it helped with laws being made later on in the world,1376870400,,138,4.148148148148148
2191157,5,B0006Q94AU,I love this moving. Private adoption isn't everything it should be. Protecting the baby is a must......but what about the parents?,1371340800,,130,5.238095238095238
2191158,5,B0006Q94AU,This movie is a fun movie to watch.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoy watching Lifetime movies.  This movie can make you aware of things that are happening around you.  Help you to know know what to look out for.,1353628800,,220,4.190476190476191
2191159,5,B0006Q94AU,I thought the movie was done very well. I enjoyed the actors performance. It shows how desprete people can be and what they are cappable of in desperation.,1344211200,,155,4.571428571428571
2191160,2,B0006Q94AU,"This movie is ironic in that it's supposed to drive home the fact that baby selling is bad, but if the Johnsons hadn't had money, they never would have gotten Gitta. I do think the baby should have been returned to the birth mother. The Johnsons got the baby on a legal technicality - the birth father didn't sign off on the adoption. I feel like this wasn't explored enough. Why didn't he? I see the birth mother as the victim here, much more than the Johnsons. Zhabo was obviously a bad person who took advantage of her. She just wanted a good home for Gitta, and showed the family picture to Mrs. Johnson in confidence, not knowing that it would be turned against her in a legal proceeding to get her child. Janka had agreed to give the baby to the Johnsons but the Johnsons and their lawyer didn't know this before pulling that - I just thought it was shady. This movie did nothing to convince me that what Zhabo did is any different than any other American adoption. Lawyer gets the green, adoptive parents get the kid, birth mom gets squat. Yes, baby auctioning is wrong, but I've worked for lawyers - they always get their money from adoption. How is adoption not a sale?

I don't think birth mothers should get paid for giving up their babies (else there would be a surge in pregnancies if they did) but adoption is a cash transaction where the rich profit, just like in Zhabo's baby auction. The birth mother/parents should get something other than just hopes that the baby will have a better life. I don't have a lot of money plus I have some mental health issues and would probably give up my baby if I got pregnant (just a hypothetical). I'd like to think he or she would have a better life that way, but rich doesn't always equal better. This movie makes me distrust legal adoption along with ""baby selling"" - they're the same thing, IMO. Rich always have an advantage over the lower income, mentally fit people have an advantage over the mentally unhealthy. I just wish adoption was equitable for all parties involved. More people would choose adoption that way.",1311033600,,2076,4.506631299734748
2191161,3,B0006Q94AU,"This is why Lifetime made this movie.

""On July 23, 2003 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to Introduce Legislation Inspired by LIFETIME Original Movie ""Baby For Sale"";- New Bill to Establish National and Tougher Penalties for Illegal Baby Brokering.""

In 2004, The Senate and the House of Representatives of The United States of America assembled and passed the Baby Selling Prohibition Act of 2004.

""Baby Selling Prohibition Act of 2004 is modeled after New York's Law.  This critical legislation will prevent families from enduring the same agony that the Schneider's went through and will ensure that every adoptive child's safety and the best interest is strictly maintained in all adoption cases.""

In the United States of America Congressional Record dated, July 22, 2004, page 17126 (S2748)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled.",1303344000,,908,5.277777777777778

2191163,5,B0006Q94AU,i loved this movie this couple shows u how much a person would do to make sure a child is safe even if it isn't theres.  this movie is great.  i just wish they had laws and strong laws back then in ny about baby trafficing.  this couple did everything in there power to save this 1 child not ever knowing if they would ever get her.  they just wanted her to be safe.,1281225600,8,366,3.9054054054054053
