7413894,4,B014JY61P0,"Gratuitous gore, great standard 80's cheese factor, quirky performances ... what's not to love?  The perfect pick for horror fans!  Watch it damnit! :D",1444780800,3,151,5.25
7413895,5,B014JY61P0,Eric Roberts! One strange film. I suggest you watch it this Halloween.,1444694400,2,70,4.916666666666667
7413896,4,B014JY61P0,"Wow!  After nearly a 20 year absence the director of the 80s cult classic/ slasher flick BLOODY BIRTHDAY has made another movie!  Being a big fan of that film I sought this one out.  Yes- it's cheesy/ corny/ ridiculous and has Eric Roberts giving a really weird performance as ""Dracula"" but there's some awesome gore and the demon looks cool.  It's a story we've seen a million times in other 80s horror flicks but it works because it is actually made by someone from that era.  So rather than ""trying"" to be a throwback horror movie it is a genuine one.  I had a good time anyway- works over a few beers and/ or your vice of choice ;)",1444694400,3,635,4.294117647058823

7413898,2,B014JY61P0,Poor acting and silly plot.,1446854400,,27,4.6
7413899,1,B014JY61P0,"This was a sad sad joke of a movie.  Really dull, nonsensical and incredibly stupid.  I know Eric Roberts isn't exactly A-list but he's better than this.  Yeesh.  An all around mess.  Even if you like bad movies this one is one to avoid like the plague.",1446076800,,253,4.297872340425532

7413905,2,B014JY61P0,A bit amateurish; some moderately good special effects.,1445472000,,55,6.0
7413906,2,B014JY61P0,"A person really likes this one or doesn't!  It's so weird, that Mr. Roberts seems like he's consuming something and so do some of the cast members.  Remember how Reagan traded guns for drugs ~ well it's a known fact that much of the stuff ended up on Hollyweird's Back lots.  Seriously though, Eric's shots were spliced in and were shot entirely separate, which gives the film a very unreal quality, because it is!",1445299200,,414,4.5675675675675675
