1067312,4,6305701172,"Everyone will find something to enjoy in this, the original FLASH GORDON serial. The adults will love all the very attractive performers (Buster Crabbe and Jean Rogers as Flash and Dale really glow), the kids will love  the excitement as Flash fights all sorts of man-beasts, sea creatures, and  minions of Ming the merciless. It's a thrilling comic book come to life,  literally!
This DVD is an especially good value. Although there aren't  any extras except for a foldout snapper case cover with detailed liner  notes, the viewer is treated to FOUR HOURS of fun sci-fi/fantasy  entertainment. Can't watch four hours? Being a serial means that it's in 13  chapters. Stop anytime! The menu makes it easy to select any chapter you  want. But I bet you wouldn't mind plunking your kids down in front of a  four hour video once in a while, and you can rest easy knowing that it's  safe for kids to watch.
Picture quality is quite excellent; although  there are flaws in the source material, they usually amount to no more than  scratchy sections, usually at reel changes. Sound quality is surprisingly  good, especially compared to videotapes of the FLASH GORDON serials.  Contrast is good, sharpness seems just right. And, darn it, it's FUN! Very  much recommended.",950054400,24,1263,4.8915094339622645
1067313,4,6305701172,"This first of the Flash Gordon serials introduces the characters and quickly immerses them in the adventures and conflicts that audiences expected to see.  The acting is impressive, especially Charles Middleton as  Ming the Merciless.  The special effects and sets are really quite good.  Sure, they don't compare to what is done routinely in movies today, but  this was 1936 and a children's afternoon serial.
The DVD transfer is  surprisingly good, given the age of the source material.  There are scenes  that show scratches and dirt, but there are even more scenes that are clear  and sharp without noticable blemishes.  I compared the DVD image with a  video tape, scene by scene, and there really was no comparison.  The DVD  picture was far superior.  The DVD's sound is also an improvement, though  again, the source material is a 64 year old mono track and there has not  been extensive work to convert it to a multichannel format.  But it is  clear and understandable.  I don't imagine most viewers will have ever seen  this material look or sound as good as it does on DVD.  The only negative I  can offer is that it is packaged in a snapper case.  I sure wish it were in  an Amaray keep case.
If you enjoy a rousing science fantasy adventure and  appreciate seeing the roots of modern sci-fi, then I highly recommend this  movie.",949017600,55,1341,4.696969696969697

1067423,5,6305701172,"I loved ""Flash Gordon"" as a child and watching the series again on DVD  brings back such fond memories. Each 15-minute episode features the adventures of our hero Flash, the lovely Dale Arden, and intrepid Dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death at every turn:  The Shark Men try to drown him, he battles the Fire Monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he's in mortal peril in the Static Room!

The characters are still fun:  Buster Crabbe is every bit the blonde dreamboat hero and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still plots to steal Flash for herself, King Vultan of the Hawk Men still has his booming laugh and angel wings, and Ming the Merciless, Emperor of the Universe, is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps.

This serial probably wouldn't interest children today with its hokey effects - oh, that spaceship! - but it's a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around.  The actors play it straight and don't play down to kids. I appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter synopses which had pretty big words in them.

I'm glad this came out on DVD. It's a lot of fun to revisit this classic  sci-fi serial.",1243468800,,1219,4.534246575342466
1067424,5,6305701172,"This is the sexiest movie serial ever made. How Universal ever slipped Dale and Princess Aura's outfits passed the Hays Office sensors, I've never know.  And for some reason, every lecherous tyrant on the planet is literally drooling over Dale Arden. No less than Emperor Ming's own daughter, Aura, commits treason just to seduce Flash.  In 1936, America was still in the midst of the Great Depression and any temporary escape from reality was too precious to waste just on the children.

The two subsequent Flash Gordon serials, in 1938 and 1940, radically toned down the sexual tension to as close to zero as possible.  But the legacy of the 1st serial lives on, in the imaginations of the generations of males who ogled Dale and Aura's midriffs, and in the miniskirts and aluminum foil bikinis of the original Star Trek.  Captain Kirk, a character who is believable only so long as one accepts the premise that a red-blooded Earth man is naturally irresistible to all women from any alien planet, owes his very existence to Flash Gordon.

The sexual overtones, like everything else great about this series, belonged to a unique period in time.  This is not only one of the all-time greatest serials; it is also one of the all time greatest comic strip adaptations, ever.  It is far more faithful to the source material and far more exciting than most of this odd little genre.  In 1936, because entertainment was so precious, adults as well as kids read the newspaper funnies, and I suspect Universal figured the audience wouldn't have tolerated any major departures from the source material.

The special effects are, of course completely unconvincing and even laughable to modern audiences.  For the audience of 1936, these images were perfectly adequate; their imaginations had not atrophied and could supplement the deficiencies. In our increasingly jaded modern world, where we need stronger and stronger doses of unreality, I find a certain charm in the handcrafted look of this serial.

Buster Crabbe is the absolute epitome of what this type of hero should be: handsome, virtuous, uncomplicated and athletic.  Crabbe had been a genuine Olympic champion, and didn't need steroids or hormones.  Flash Gordon is decisive; he is the kind of guy who figures out what to do and takes action. He doesn't waste his time with ambivalence angst, or ennui; his audience had no time for such things... people in the depression were too busy just trying to survive!

The rest of the cast is also great, especially Charles Middleton as Ming the Merciless.  If he isn't the absolute greatest villain of all serials, then he is certainly the standard by which all such villains are to be judged.  The other players, however, each fully invest their characters with total feeling.  Modern viewers not used to the acting style of this period are liable to think these performances over the top, but actually, they are simply exuberant.

This serial moves quickly and is always either interesting or exciting. It is full of great fight scenes, wild costumes and sets, buzzing and sparking electrical devices, and rocket ship dog fights.  The basic plot involves Flash fighting Ming the Merciless, who declares himself absolute Ruler of Mongo by the authority of his Personal Deity.  Flash fights what amounts to be asymmetrical warfare against Ming, who has vastly superior forces and weapons.  Ming retaliates against Flash by torturing him and several of his compatriots.

Flash uses unconventional tactics; in one sequence he brings a whole city to its knees by sabotaging its energy production.  Flash also works with various ethnic groups, such as the Lion Men and the Hawk Men, finding areas of mutual benefit and forging alliances.  Although these people appear to be physically different than Earth Men, Flash seems to presume they are equals and treats them as such.  In the Depression, audiences believed that a red-blooded American would never tolerate a theocratic despot, that he wouldn't hesitate to fight for justice and to free oppressed people.  This is probably the biggest difference of all between the original audience, and modern viewers.  Truly, `Flash Gordon' belongs to a world that is lost to us.",1207267200,4,4214,5.015804597701149
1067425,5,6305701172,"Buster Crabbe as the original Flash Gordon with Charles Middleton,as Emperor Ming the Merciless, Jean Rogers as Dale Arden and the sultry Priscilla Lawson as Princess Aura. This is one of the few Flash Gordon adventure films available nowadays where you can watch the entire and very best Flash Gordon episodes crew together. The entire Flash Gordon 1930's-1940 original series should be released. Flash Gordon battles with Ming to avoid the Earth's destruction as his arch-rival is always hell bent on destroying or conquering Earth. Princess Aura as always, is not loyal to her cruel father, Emperor Ming and helps Flash because she has fallen in love with him. This film brings good memories. More should be released.",1206489600,,720,5.110169491525424
1067426,4,6305701172,"Though not D. H. Lawrence, ""Flash Gordon"" shows a suprising amount of emotion other than the usual hate between protagonist and antagonist.  It's most noticeable in the ""battle"" between Dale and Princess Aura
over Flash. Dale's love for him and sincere worry and fretting goes a step deeper than the usual cardboard boy-and-girl aspect in other serials. Princess Aura's lust seeps out of her like sweat on a hot August day. Both women are incredibly sexy in different ways and bring a lusty component, by their competing for Flash, that you just don't see in your typical serial including the other 2 Buster Crabbe-Flash Gordons and his Buck Rogers, otherwise high caliber chapter plays. Coupling that factor with other aspects, described by reviewers, I would have to rate this the greatest serial ever made.",1192838400,,809,5.037313432835821
1067427,4,6305701172,"I got this DVD as part of a 3 DVD box set (with Flash Gordon's trip to Mars, and Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe) and this is definitely the best of the bunch.  The acting is terrible, the dialog is so bad as to be funny (I think Mystery Science Theater would have a field day), and the special effects have to be seen to be believed (the rockets are propelled by firecrackers, etc).  Watching this today is like watching a spoof of the whole ""Space Opera"" genre, and as such it works wonderfully (much better than, say, Space Balls). It's also an exciting story with various plot twists and cliffhangers (sometimes literally) at the end of each episode.  Sure, the acting, dialog, recycled film (haven't we seen that before?) and general silliness gets in the way, but it's still an engaging story.

This is the full 4 hours, but some of this is taken up by opening and closing credits, summaries of the proceeding episodes, and repeats of the last few scenes of the proceeding episode.  My one complaint is that these aren't indexed so there's no easy way to skip these (so as to watch a continuous movie) except by fast forwarding.",1190764800,,1137,4.553921568627451

1067429,3,6305701172,"Well, this was my first exposure to the original Flash Gordon serial, after seeing clips of it for years and watching the laughably-bad 1980 feature film.  I have to say that although I'm not ready to proclaim it a ""classic,"" I was certainly entertained for four hours.  And wasn't that really the point of this short films back in the early days of sound cinema?  They packed plenty of action, colorful characters and outrageous situations into each 20-minute chapter.

As a lifelong science-fiction fan, I got a campy kick out of the ""science"" in this one.  My favorite line from the opening chapter: As Dale Arden begins to have trouble breathing as the rocketship carrying Flash, Zarkov and her blasts from Earth's atmosphere, Zarkov apologizes thusly, ""Sorry...in all the excitement, I forgot to turn on the oxygen.""

If you don't mind leaving your brain at the door, or get a nostalgic thrill from such lurid theatrics, you could do a lot worse than this first Flash series.",1172188800,3,980,4.838323353293413
1067430,4,6305701172,"You'll laugh out loud at the ""special effects"" and some of the acting, but these Flash Gordon episodes -- originally shown in movie houses, and later on some television stations in the 1950s and 1960s -- are cool entertainment as well as history for sci-fi fans.

1067510,5,6305701172,"World renowned polo player ""Flash"" Gordon must save the Earth from being destroyed by the insideous (and leacherous) Ming the Merciless-- played with sadistic relish by Charles Middleton. Both Buster Crabbe as Flash and Jean Rogers as Dale play their roles with an enthusiasm and sincerity that just no longer exist on the screen. But my heart was won by the luscious Pricilla Lawson as the scheming Princess Aura-- who's as hot for Flash as her dad is for Dale.

The production design is amazingly good, and mostly based on the Alex Raymond comic strip-- which is also where the plot originates. There are plenty of silly rubber monster suits, iguanas with glued on horns and dubbed-in bronchitis, space ships that backfire before they take off, and lotsa precode jiggle.

To me, it all spells one thing: PURE CINEMA!!!",1136592000,2,820,4.892086330935252
1067511,5,6305701172,"Universal's 1936 production of ""Flash Gordon"" remains among the all-time great serials. The chapterplay's influence on ""Star Wars"" is readily evident during the 13 episodes of sci-fi action and spectacle. Buster Crabbe made his mark in cinema history as the heroic Flash  the same goes for Charles Middleton's Ming the Merciless. Terrific and timeless fun.

It is really the only one of the three that contains considerable romance as Pricess Aura and the BLOND Dale Arden both vie for Flash's attention.

1067515,4,6305701172,"The Hays Code hadn't really cracked down yet on filmmaker's when this amazingly cheesy but nonetheless terrific serial was made.
Sharkmen, Lion Men, Hawk Men, Octo-sac, Orangupoid, Tigron, giant Gocko Lizard, iguanas with horns that drool slime, some of the worst acting of all time,  men running around in short shorts (or full suits of armor, sometimes medieval, sometimes faux roman), goofy rocket ships on wires, underwater cities, sky palaces, atom furnaces, torture rooms---- you name it, you get it here! You will NOT BELIEVE what Flash has to endure within the first day of his adventure---when did he ever eat or sleep to keep up his superhuman strength??
An amazingly wild ride, an adventure that piles one audacious, salacious, lurid, sensational scene on top of another---only near the end of the film, with the incessant trips back and forth between the lab and Ming's throne room does the hectic pace start to slacken.
The cast is a hoot!  And those of you who know the Three Stooges shorts of the 30's and 40's will howl with delight as you observe:
Duke York (the Stooge's ""Zulu Spear Thrower"", ""Wolfman"", the Hunchback ""Angel"",  ""Nikko"", etc) as King Cala of the Shark Men,
(who utters the immortal line ""But how does one stop an Octo-sac?"")
Jack ""Tiny"" Lipson (""The Bay of Rum"", etc) as the nutty King Vultan
Ted Lorch (""Major Filbert can smell a spy a mile away!"", etc) as the over-the-top High Priest (Second half of the serial only---the old dude who plays the role in the first half (I think his name was Lon Poff) mysteriously disappears midway through.  No loss--he was dreadful).  Ted is just plain nuts, especially in his final MAD SCENE (""I placed a BOMB in their ship!!"")
Also, Richard Alexander (Prince Barin) and the amazing Charles Middleton (MING!) who each appeared in a single Stooges short (in ""Spook Louder"" Middleton and Ted Lorch appeared together, in a reversal of their Flash Gordon servant/master roles)
You also spot a young Glenn Strange (Sam the Bartender from ""Gunsmoke"",  Frankenstein monster w/ Abbott and Costello)
as a soldier/guard during Flash's ""Invisible"" scenes.
And--King Thun is played by James Pierce who was (I believe) the son-in-law of Tarzan author Edgar Rice Burroughs.  (He was also one of the 2 thugs in Marx Bros. ""Horse Feathers""--unfortunately, he was barely an actor).
What a digression!!----and what FUN!
This first Flash Gordon serial is definitely the goofiest of them all---and it's thankfully been preserved on DVD---looking and sounding about as good as you could hope for (lots of scratches, etc--but still very watchable)--and what's more--IT's COMPLETE!  Original Soundtrack, too,--unlike another VHS release
about 10 years ago that actually superimposed a tinny-sounding,
trumpet and snare drum musical track ON TOP of the original!!
Lastly, the babes---there's no end to the shots of Dale and Princess Aura in their skimpy halter tops, each ot them lusting after the big guy in their own unique way.  Alas, when the second serial appeared two years later, the Hays Code was in full force;  you can hardly believe that Dale is the same gal.

It features a vibrant alien planet with great perils for its main protagonist and his friends. The technical aspects are dated, but still work within the context of the narrative. However, the characters are noticeably one-dimensional, which makes the viewing tedious  together with the many repetitions in editing, the score, and plot elements. Aspects like the imaginativeness and the thrilling pacing are very entertaining, but generally this serial does not hold up well, without taking on a nostalgic perspective.
