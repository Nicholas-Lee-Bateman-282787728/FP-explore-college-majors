1925624,1,B0000DK4NO,"Granted, historically based movies can never be completely historically accurate, and there is room to debate many of the key issues in Henry VIII's reign, but it doesn't even appear that the producers read one historical account, opting instead to produce an violent, nauseating portrayal of Henry VIII, his wives and their times.  Yes, the sixteenth century was violent, but Henry VIII was much more than a barbaric thug. The scenes with Anne Boleyn, played with some skill by Helena Bonham Carter (though her character is far too underdeveloped) were overshadowed by moments which ranged from laughable (Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn  skinny dipping) to horrific (Henry VIII brutally rapes Anne Boleyn toward the end of their marriage.) There is no need for this, and if you are a person who has studied the lives of these individuals as I have, it is offensive. Not to mention there was no need for the gratuitous scene of the beheading of Anne Boleyn, where you see the executioner hold up Anne Boleyn's severed bloody head. It's all shock and very little substance.

  There is not enough room to recount the historical inaccuracies in this film. Suffice it to say there were many, and while a good film could rise above those inaccuracies, this did not. When it wasn't completely wrong, the movie repeats (almost verbatim) lines from a much better film about these characters, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Anyone who is interested in knowing more about Henry VIII should stay away from this film. some creative license is acceptable and expected, but I would at least expect the makers of this movie to base some of the plot on historical facts.  Anne of the Thousand Days is not wholly accurate either, but at least it attempts to ground the plot and the characters in some historical basis. I would refer anyone to Anne of the Thousand Days or better yet, a good biography such as Starkey's Six Wives or Ives' Anne Boleyn. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I would advise anyone truly interested in Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn to avoid this film.  I am just glad I saw it on tv and didn't waste my money buying it, as I am very disappointed. I will admit I haven't seen the second part of this series, but I have no doubt that it will be as bad if not worse than the first. Even if the second part is better, I doubt it could redeem the first part of this movie which I have just reviewed",1099872000,25,2401,4.60655737704918

1925626,4,B0000DK4NO,"Somewhat far from historically accurate, (one can rest fairly assured that Henry didn't have a cockney accent,) but some very good acting here mostly all around, with fine costumes and scenery.  Would like it to have been a good deal longer and gone into greater detail, especially the Anne Boleyn segment.  Jane Seymour was ridiculously attractive and confrontational, especially since she was playing pale, meek: ""Plain Jane."" Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, not surprisingly had the best roles, but far more could have been made especially of Anne of Cleves, Catherine Parr and his hapless daughter Mary.  Some great little bits thrown in, such as Henry slavering over plumbs and charging down the steps outside while holding up his nightshirt. For those of us hooked on the Tudor period, a must-have for your collection.  Although low in budget and shot indoors, I still compare every movie and mini-series to the original BBC: ""Six Wives of Henry VIII;"" sadly, all that follows manages to fall short in one manner or another for me.",1436745600,,1042,5.005780346820809

1925634,3,B0000DK4NO,"This portrayal of the Tudor monarch is one of its own kind. Ray Winston plays a tough as nails king whose reactions are unpredictable and to the sword's point! The king does have psychiatric issues with his attitude and his outbursts! Some shredding of apprehension and shame drain from his scenes of remorse, like that when Jane Seymour gave him his long desired son too soon. The scene of when he learns of Katherine Howard and screams to Heaven also rips from his angry hearts his anguish and frustration. Could he not have one perfect wife?

Some clearer screening could have done this film justice and some extra scenes of Anne of Cloves would be great. She was not insignificant to Henry's life, as he willingly let her stay in England and called her sister. Their meeting should have also been shown. She also was shown at his burial, which indicated their sibling affections. Helen Bonham Carter was perfect as Anne Boleyn as she also was strong headed and a bold speaker.

1925640,2,B0000DK4NO,"I have to agree with the other reviews that said this movie is bad. I was very disappointed in the poor performance of Henry the ""king"" who goes from hot head screaming, to whimpering at Anne's feet, to a downright whining, crying girl in the hallway after Anne gives birth to queen Elizabeth. One of the most uncomfortable scenes was where Henry and Cardinal Wosley share an ""man embrace"" after Henry holds open his arms and says ""come 'ere"" and Wosley sobs like a six year old in his arms apologizng, only to have Henry say ""too late"" and send him off to his death. How ridiculous?!
I agree with the other post about the costumes, with every woman at court running around with their hair down and TOO TIGHT bodices. Helen Bonham Carter, who is a slim woman, looked like Fiona Shrek! There is so much more bad about this movie, I can't even get it all in. If you want a great movie about King Henry, see The other Bolyn girl with Scarlett Johansson. I loved this movie, it was so beautifully done.",1355875200,,998,4.4
1925641,5,B0000DK4NO,"I really enjoyed this re-telling of Henry VIII. The production values were excellent, the acting excellent, the dialog engaging, and it offered a slightly different take on Henry as a character than other ""Tudor Stories"".

However, there were some scenes and dialog that seemed to be lifted from other Tudor productions, most notably Catherine of Aragon's speech to Anne Boleyn when she was going to the divorce court, and her address to the English court where she demands to be tried only by the Pope. It seemed very familiar and I was wondering, was it taken from an historical reference? Was it lifted from a movie (""The Other Boleyn Girl"", ""Anne of 1,000 Days"")?

And that led to me to be curious about the accuracy of other parts of the story. What happened to Thomas Moore in this one (He was historically an adviser to Henry, yet he's not in the movie)?

It is important to keep in mind that there are MANY ""Tudor Stories"" available, and each has a different take on Henry, much as ""Elizabeth Epics"" have different takes on her.

And that adds another curiosity - what is is about this monarch that makes him such a good subject for a drama - over and over again?

""Long live the King"" really means something when it comes to Henry VIII because hundreds of years after his reign, we're still trying to figure him out, and he makes wonderful soap opera material! It's more than the 6 wives, it's Henry himself who fascinates us. How could he have been who he was and did the things he did? He is a conundrum and a mass of conflicts. I guess we like that in our historical monarchs.

This movie (well, TV drama) is very well done because of the take they use for the character of Henry.

We all know about (and have seen) the absolute monarch angle (i.e. ""The Tudors"", which admittedly came AFTER this movie), we all know the lustful sexual athlete angle (""Anne of 1,000 Days"", with brilliant performances all round, especially by Richard Burton), we all know the more historically precise formal historical angle (""Henry VIII and his Six Wives"").

But in this version, we see Henry as a much more down-to-earth monarch, with less emphasis on court formality and more emphasis on a ""super athlete"" type of character, with matching dialog and speech.

History tells us that he was never trained to be a king; he was destined for the church and received much religious training, but little political or diplomatic training. History tells us that he adored sport of all kinds and liked the ""manly arts"", archery, hunting, horseback riding. History tells us that physically, he stood head-and-shoulders above his contemporaries, like a huge football star of today, with an energy to match. This movie seems to follow the latter characteristics of Henry's personality so we see him as a ""rough-and-tumble"" monarch who is easily misled by ambitious advisers.

History may have been dictated by the Tudors themselves, so we have to consider it carefully. And it is important before criticizing the film's historical accuracy to remember that historical records account for a small fraction of a person's entire life. It cannot record in detail the intimate details of a man's life. The dramatists (from Shakespeare on) must fill in those details with their imaginations, and there in lies the ""meat"" of the drama.

So, the question is, does this movie meet dramatic needs? Does it entertain? Does it leave one thinking and contemplating Henry and those around him -- as characters, as people?

I'd say yes, each version of Henry's life does this in its own unique way. And this movie, coming as it does after a long line of ""Henry films"" successfully meets the challenge of using well known material and engaging the audience in it yet again.

The script, the production itself, the costumes, the dialog all work together to this end. It is well directed and much of the credit goes to the actors because they make us believe all the other stuff.

The most notable performances are:

Ray Winstone as Henry, looks the part and is an engaging actor who is convincing and believable. He carries the show. His Henry is a rough and tumble, practical sort of guy who definitely gets more and more unhinged as time goes on. He is suitably vulnerable and human while also being an absolute monarch and dictator. He makes Henry fascinating and terrifying, a hero at times, a villain at others. At times you love him, at times you hate him, and most of all, you can't forget him.

Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Anne Boleyn, tough, cunning, conniving and tragic in the end. She's always a delight. (I'm a fan of her work, so I admit a certain prejudice). Of all the wives in this production, she is the most memorable and I believe she gets the most air time.

Danny Webb delivers a fine performance as Thomas Cromwell. He epitomizes the word, ""toady"", craftily sneaking around Henry for his own ambitions and is suitably terrified when he falls out of favor. His execution scene is particularly horrid and tragic.

David Suchet gives us a rather subdued Cardinal Wolsey compared to other portrayals, but he's sufficiently cold and calculating.

The production values of the film are very high, and there is actually less blood and gore (two vivid executions and a torture scene, the rest is glossed over) than I would expect from a cable channel TV movie. There are a few explicit sex scenes and some nudity. These didn't bother me much. After all Henry was a lusty man. They showed a certain restraint (more so than the later ""The Tudors"") and in 2003, showing a sex scene with any restraint on TV is something of an accomplishment!

In the end, was this an entertaining movie and would I watch it again? Well, though I know the Tudor story from so many tellings, I say YES to both. I found the production to be engaging and had a fast enough pace to keep me with it, even though I knew perfectly well how things would turn out for all the characters.

The only thing lacking, in this and other Tudor productions is the unanswerable question... What is it about Henry (and Elizabeth I, for that matter) that makes him so darn fascinating?

Is it his mixture of vices and virtues? Is it his ""larger than life"" persona? Or is it simply the sense of suspense and danger about him? When you were in his favor, his generosity was amazing. When you were not, his vengeance was appalling.

History tells us that Henry brought stability and relative peace (in spite of his wars to regain France) to the country. It tells us that the arts flourished during his reign, that there was a great deal of building, Universities got started, and the people loved him.

It seems the only people at risk were the one's who tried to use him or to cross him.

With any ruler, that's a dangerous game. But with Henry, it's a source of endless entertainment!",1340668800,,6833,4.669442131557036
1925642,3,B0000DK4NO,"This show takes liberties on the Henry story , much like the tv show the tudors did too. Still Ray Winstone is excellent as the bloodthirsty and rapacious; but in some ways great king.  This is a newer version of the story and so on dvd it looks great but, don't expect accuracy in historical details. that is one reason the classic 'six wives of henry the eighth' is a superior show content wise. Although that was shot on sets using videotape. This one is still worth watching and I actually own this dvd. The main fault is that unlike the classic 1930's version which starred Charles Laughton, this just doesn't have the writing or wit of that movie. It's fine , and I would say worth watching though. It's just not outstanding , the acting is fine though. If you liked the Tudors , you will like this , although henry in either show really doesn't become the sick , huge man , he would become in later life.  The man was huge at six foot five! and really handsome in his youth, but by his last days his people had named him 'the mugwarp'.

1925647,5,B0000DK4NO,"This 2003 color film (DVD) is now available in a 2-disc set at Big Lots for three bucks which is where I got mine.

It's the story of Henry VIII, from the time of his youth on through his adulthood and his many wives. His chief concern throughout his life was to sire a male heir and he really didn't care who had to die to make this happen.

The cinematography is terrific and vibrant (I know that the widescreen edition would be even better) and the acting is spot-on. David Suchet (PBS's Poirot) is especially compelling as Cardinal Wolsey.  Some of the Henry VIII films come across as documentaries (in fact some are) but this one is a movie of the first water.

If you enjoy this historical genre of films you're sure to like this one. Technically, I guess this film qualifies as a mini-series, being originally broadcast in two parts as it is presented in this DVD set. The movie runs for a total of 200 minutes and is an HBO production.

I viewed the movie in its entirety, and I enjoyed it!! I was not looking for historical accuracy. I viewed it simply for entertaintment purposes. The acting was great, the costumes were great; brutal in some scenes, but then again, that was Henry VIII's life.

I thoroughly enjoyed the way the director portrays Henry's love for Anne Boleyn. This is a movie of uncontrolable passion, lots of betrayal and political back stabbing in and out of the court, and heads rolling.

Simply entertaining and full of drama.

1925649,4,B0000DK4NO,"I cannot figure out for the life of me why so many people are giving his movie horrible, almost vicious, reviews.  The main complaint seems to be the historical inaccuracies.  Well, the showtime TV show The Tudors is worse, grossly inaccurate, yet many people still enjoy it. This movie is inaccurate as are many film interpretations, but get over it.  Other reviewers said that the actors were miscast and didn't look anything like the real-life personas.  I 100% disagree.  One only needs to compare a painting of Henry VIII to Ray Winstone to see the resemblence.  In fact, Ray Winstone is probably my favorite Henry VII as he somehow manages to make a man who was overweight and unattractive seem sexually appealing.  The show The Tudors, which I do like as well, is basically a Hollywood soap opera version where everyone is incredibly attractive.  But what I liked about this film was that it was the opposite - the actors looked similar to the real people (more similar than any other film interpretation) and, as a result, seemed more realistic.  The movie itself is a bit long and not the most exciting - more of a docudrama than a soap opera like the Tudors - but it definitely is worth watching, if at least to see another interpretation of Henry VII's life.",1215216000,6,1269,4.68018018018018

1925653,4,B0000DK4NO,"I am not a historian and follow this period purely as a hobby, so I am in no position to argue with those who feel this movie is historically innacurate. However, in the research I do on the period, it seems there are differing accounts of various events in history-when information is that old it's going to be twisted around a bit. And frankly, there have been major historical innacuracies in a LOT of the Tudor films-Elizabeth, anybody? I will say this-I was bothered by the scenes in which Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were executed publicly, when, as far as I know, they were both extended the privilege of being executed privately on the tower green, with only a few select people present. To have Anne coming out and having people mock her and shout ""whore""-that was one innacuracy that stuck out to me.

All in all though I must say I was indeed entertained by this film. Dramatically I think it is a nice achievement, with excellent acting if not the best script. The pacing is awkward, with the entire first half focusing on Anne Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon, and the second half whizzing through the other four wives, barely paying any attention to Anne of Cleves (she doesn't even SAY anything in this version) and Catherine Parr (A fascinating woman and the stuff of great drama). But the other stories were nicely condensed I feel.

I greatly enjoy Winstone, in fact he is my favorite portrayal of Henry VIII and here is why: He adds a humanity to this tyrant that you rarely see. For dramatic purposes he becomes softer as he ages, and while I realize that is not entirely accurate, it makes the audience feel for him and tempts us to look beyond the black and white wife murderer image of this king. I particularly enjoy his scenes with Catherine Howard-here we are two hours into the movie and we are seeing yet another side of his character-humility.

I enjoy all of the portrayals of the wives with the exception of Bonham Carter. First of all she is WAAAY to old. She doesn't look her age but this is film, and you can't get away with casting someone who is obviously age innappropriate. She exerts herself nicely in the scene where Henry rejects her once and for all when their son is born dead, but in other scenes she seems indifferent. For what Henry put the country through for her, we should have seen more fire-it is hard to believe that he found this woman so special that he tore England apart on her behalf. I wanted Genevieve Bujold from Anne of the Thousand Days-her paired with Winstone, now that would have made for some incredible drama. (I know, I know, the two films are 35 years apart...but one can dream!)

All in all, I didn't learn anything from this adaptation, but the story of Henry's wives is like a fairy tale that I just like to hear over and over, and this version is an entertaining adaptation.",1201737600,4,2850,4.538910505836576
1925654,1,B0000DK4NO,"For those of you who know about the BBC Series ""The East Enders"", about blue collar Britons in East London, this will be a clear message.

For those of you, who know nothing about this, let me just say, that although ""East Enders"" is a long running series on BBC, and very successful at that in its own right, it is the story of a working class community that shows everyday dramas of common ""Cockney"" people.

Although they do not speak too tight, they still preserve their working class accents.

And so it is here, in this version of ""Henry VIII"".

This is an insult to intelligence and good taste.

Not just history-wise, but also to all those working class people in the East End of London, who are in fact, far brighter and intelligent as to fall for this weak attempt to bring History to the ""simple man"".

How can you imagine that a man such as Henry VIII, brought up and educated  by the Company of Jesus (a.k.a. Jesuits), both in rhetoric and fine literature, as well as mastering Ancient Greek, Latin and French, could still speak with a working class ""Cockney"" accent?

This alone should give you a hint on how bad and how ridiculous the entire movie is.

Nor does it help to have Charles Dance (who actually appears and disappears almost immediately) on board, or Helena Bonham-Carter, doing her own bit, as usual, but that has no connection to the true Anne Boleyn (neither physically, nor in personality), or again David Suchet, whose experience as an actor gets totally wasted, by making him too, into a ""Cockney"" Cardinal Wolsey... (better watch him in Poirot).

This film takes so many liberties with actual historic fact, such as actual historic feats and details, up to even having all the wrong hair styles, wrong costumes and completely wrong social behaviors of the time.

No one bothered to do in-depth biographical researches nor to stick somewhat, to actual court protocol and etiquette of the times.

It seems that all the producers, writer(s) and the director wanted, was to slam an MTV generation styled drama onto film, to entertain their own aficionados.

Unfortunately they actually managed to go public with this embarrassing product of ignorance, arrogant populism and primitive conception of history.

In one word: Revisionist.

Revisionism, as we all know, is the specialty of upstarts who never bothered to actually study about what truly came before them, and just love to rewrite history as they please, in order to make it more comfortable to them to justify their otherwise embarrassing and abysmal ignorance pervading the world they have built for themselves, out of accumulating money, but never having spent a minute studying the texts they claim they know, nor having set eyes on actual books of the period.

Some reviewers have criticized the 1972 produced movie ""Henry VIII and his Six Wives"" (starring Keith Michell as Henry VIII, reprising his role from the successful BBC series ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII""), as being bad, but let me tell you, that the movie was made for U.S. audiences in mind, who either never got to see the BBC series in the first place, or never got a chance to hear about it (the BBC series is now readily available on DVD in a box set).

In fact, the movie has a completely new cast, sporting actors such as Charlotte Rampling and Donald Pleasence (whose daughter was part of the BBC series also).

This movie was meant as a sort of a ""compendium"" to the BBC series, and both form a complete and almost accurate (except for some dramatic licenses here and there), history lesson and are far more biographically accurate than this present product.

Add also Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold's ""Anne of the thousand days"" and Paul Scofield and Robert Shaw's appearances in ""A Man for All Seasons"" and you will truly have the complete Henry VIII's tale as it should be told in a movie.

This ""Henry VIII"" is pretentious and simplistic to say the least and it is not even ""modern"" as the director tries to defend himself.

Being modern can also mean to still have some taste and intelligence left to produce something of value, without treating history as trash.
But more important than anything else is that no matter whether you try to reach blue collar workers or white collar ones, a movie-maker ought to have some respect for them.

I do not get a great sense of this respect in this movie.
They liked it, so we have to like it.

No, this is not how it works my dear fellas. You are meant to educate and to bring awareness among people, especially when dealing with history.

IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THIS, THEN GET YOUR PAWS OFF OF IT!!!!

Besides, Ray Winstone is the weakest Henry VIII I have ever seen walk the stage or the screen.

I still remember Charles Laughton or Robert Shaw playing him, or even Keith Michell (to me still the definitive Henry), and they all brought majesty into the character.

Ray Winstone, probably due to his background as an actor, and to his stocky appearance, but not stature, is constantly forced to yell and yell, but never really comes through as a Monarch.

He could at best play King John Plantagenet, but never, ever Henry VIII.

He is too weak and looks more like a ""docker"", than a true King.

Besides as far as Kings go, they would never shout in public. Their rants and their anger attacks always happen behind closed doors, away from the public eye.

I had hoped that this production be as good as its predecessors, or at least as its contemporaries with ""Elizabeth I"" (Helen Mirren) and ""The Virgin Queen"" (Anne-Marie Duff), but no such luck.

While I am at it, why did they not cast Robbie Coltrane (""From Hell"" and ""The World is Not Enough"") for the role of Henry VIII?
He is a ""Cockney"" as well, but at least HE would have had the stature and I bet he would have played the role with more distinction and fervor than Ray Winstone.

The DVD transfer is OK, both in sound, as well as in its image quality, but as said, the movie is not worth a dime or a penny.

If you are seriously interested in History and want also acting skills and good writing going hand in hand, then go with the movies and BBC series I have mentioned above.

Leave this forgettable and empty-headed MTV-styled product to those who love to drink beer and eat popcorn.
They won't mind either way, since their attention span is as long as the length of a commercial break anyway.

I am sorry, but in order to produce a History movie, it takes far more talent than this.
Certain rules will always apply, but some people don't seem to really care nor do they seem to realize that their careers depend on this simple fact.

I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, not even to my dog, who seems to be far more intelligent than some people...",1177372800,4,6742,4.607023411371237
1925655,3,B0000DK4NO,"I've read all the other reviews and agree with them - by and large. If you know the history of the Tudor period, this program really ain't it - except in its sweeping overview of history.

What I thought was fascinating was that these people seemed more 'real' to me than in the other programs I've seen. Though it is infinitely better in terms of reporting history, Keith Michell's The Six Wives of Henry VIII seems antiseptic to me, like there's really nothing at stake.

While I agree with the others that Henry wasn't the kind of man who would personally treat his wives cruelly (raping, throwing them to the ground), this is the first rendition of him where I saw him as charismatic, a larger-than-life figure. I don't care that the actor playing him isn't the right height...

... I don't care that the wives don't have the right color hair. For the most part (Anne of Cleves the exception, she certainly wasn't on-screen for very long), the wives seemed more flesh and blood here than elsewhere. For once, I could see what Henry must have seen in Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. Even if her death scene was woefully written (Catherine didn't throw a tantrum before being beheaded), this actress playing her was both beautiful and conveyed a sexual knowledge far beyond her years.

The historical accuracy problems have been well documented - and are endless. But for my money, this series gives a good overview of how dangerous life was in the Tudor court, and the types of personalities that thrived within it.",1173312000,4,1520,4.703007518796992
1925656,1,B0000DK4NO,"I do not expect historical accuracy in every movie about Henry VIII like we've seen it in the BBC production with Keith Michell. Even the BBC production bears some inaccuracies and changes in its script but they do not contradict history like this one!

Ah, where to begin? The actor chosen for Henry VIII was dreadfully miscast. The only resemblance was that he had red hair & that's it. The historical Henry VIII towered over everyone surrounding him at his court (He was 6''2, a very unusual height at the time), he didn't speak with a Cockney accent & didn't behave like a drunken brute. Henry VIII, for all that Hollywood attempts to change, was a king of refinement and knowledge. Despite being married to six women throughout his life he was a prude whose behavior towards women & the lords at his court was worthy of a king. I do not expect the genius of Keith Michell from every actor who portrays this role but here we've arrived at a new low! A Henry VIII hitting & raping his wives? Nothing we know of Henry (And his enemies would have been delighted to report such low behavior) suggests that he ever abused any of his wives in such a way. Not even Anne Boleyn or Catherine Howard suffered from his hands directly once he had chosen to send them to the block for whatever offense they may have committed but were left by him in cold blood.

Aside from this the wives were portrayed awfully. Has any of the writers here read a history book? Katherine of Aragon was fair & blue eyed (Only the BBC productions got that right) & not slender, dark eyed & dark haired. She never spoke in such a fashion to Anne Boleyn for it would have been beyond her dignity to address the matter to anyone, much less to the lady who caused it. Helena Bonham Carter was too old to play 19 year old Anne, plus she was obviously pregnant.

It goes on and on.... Breaches of etiquette, inaccurate costumes & hairstyles, overly corny executions...

These days it's in to rewrite history in Hollywood. But not in a way that produced enchanting little masterpieces like ""Young Bess"" or ""The private life of Henry VIII""....no, history is reduced to a tabloid soap.",1164844800,5,2149,4.5167095115681235

The man was a lover, fighter, mass murderer yet he was human. The obvious bias in favor of Henry VIII is so evident that it is laughable, and the attempts to create pathos for ""Good King Harry"" create more comedy than drama. Henry rapes and abuses Anne Boleyn yet the movie makers find it in their hearts to zoom in on his face and play sorrowful music to try and create sympathy for the abuser rather than the abused. The movie was saved by Henry VIII's wives, most notably his second, Anne Boleyn played in a masterful way by Helena Bonham Carter.  In fact, the only reason I give this film four stars is because of Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Blunt (Katherine Howard). Both of these women gave stellar performances as did all the wives. Ray Winstone gave a good performance but did not opt for a regal accent. I strongly disbelieve that Henry VIII sounded like he came out of Cheapside.",1155340800,,1048,4.458333333333333

Plenty of others have complained about the wild inaccuracies, from tiny things (headwear) to major world-changing events (the break with Rome skipped over in a heartbeat), so I'll sum up quickly. The dialogue and situations themselves seem forced and highly unrealistic--for instance, Henry VIII leans over others watching a joust, including Katharine of Aragon and Cardinal Wolsey, to flirt with Anne Boleyn. Other highlights: Wolsey personally torturing Buckingham in the Tower (wrong in at least 3 different ways), Princess Mary torn shrieking from her mother by brutal guards, Henry bending Anne over a table and raping her.

1925661,2,B0000DK4NO,"Ray Winstone is a really good actor but as other reviewers have already said he comes off as a merry olde England version of Tony Soprano. Sure I love Tony but that's all wrong here.  If you know anything about Tudor England you will be very unhappy with this version of Henry VIII. It is historically inaccurate to the extreme.  It's like the MTV version.  Why does everyone in the cast sound more educated and sophisticated than the king? Heck why are they all so obviously smarter?  Why do they even look better dressed? Who would've dared in real life to outshine the king to his face? The portrayal of Jane Seymour was an anachronism. By all contemporary accounts Jane was a  little mouse who was content to let her brothers do the wheeling and dealing. She is too bold in this version.  Helena Bonham Carter looks like she was born to play Queen Anne but she doesn't play the role as tough as she should've. The real Anne Boleyn got the king to abandon his wife and child, give up his religion, and slaughter 1000s of people including friends who had served him faithfully all their lives. She must have been INCREDIBLE. Bonham-Carter wasn't.

I liked Winstone a bit better when he was playing old Henry and some of the lout-in-the-pub mannerisms were toned down. His courtship of naughty Catherine Howard was almost touching. I really liked Sean Bean. Sean was the one really  bright spot and I liked the montage of memories at the end of Henry's life and the smug look on Princess Elizabeth's face at his funeral. Although I have to point out that in real life Elizabeth would've hardly dared to look so pleased under the circumstances. To sum up I have to say that unless you really love Ray Winstone and want to watch everything he does skip this version.

1925664,4,B0000DK4NO,"I've been reading these negative reviews of this film and I truly wonder if there's a single substantive complaint.  From criticisms of the costume choices to the soundtrack to Ray Winstone's accent, I'm wondering if anyone was watching this film for its cinematic value rather than, like LOTR fans with too much time on their hands, squinting at the screen to see if they could detect some flaws.  Did the film capture with compelling force key aspects of Henry's relationships with his wives?  In my view, it certainly did.

In terms of the character of Henry himself: okay, they got an actor who was shorter than some of the other cast and he has a working-class accent.  But the truth is that if their actor for the role of Henry VIII had been speaking in a historically accurate dialect, none of us would have been able to understand a word that he said.  The English of the time bore very little resemblance to the English that we speak now.  And seriously, does it have anything to do with the quality of the movie that Henry was shorter than some of the other male cast members (even though, as one reviewer points out, he was in real life more than 6 feet tall)?  Give me a break.  I research and write historical novels and I don't remember once being distressed if physical aspects such as height or eye color weren't sufficiently represented in novels I've read or movies I've watched.  It certainly has no bearing on the quality of the work.

One of the primary jobs of those who perform historical works is to make the stories as compelling today as they were for the people who lived them.  So many things have fundamentally changed from that culture to this, that to watch the real players live out their lives in the way they actually did would pack little emotional punch.  For instance, standards of beauty have dramatically changed -- in my view, of the portraits of Henry's wives that survive, Anne of Cleves is easily the most attractive, although Henry was so disgusted by her that he couldn't even consummate his marriage.  Would it make sense to, in the pursuit of historical accuracy, have her portrayed in the film as an attractive woman?  Please.  If the actress they had play Anne Boleyn looked anything like her portrait no-one would believe that anyone got hot and bothered about her, let alone risk losing his kingdom for her.  Should we also be distressed that her extra nipple and partial sixth finger weren't shown?

Ray Winstone is a superb actor and I believe he fully realizes the contradictions in Henry's character.  He wasn't a ""bouncer"" as one reviewer characterized him, but he certainly was a man of the people with an exuberant social life and friendships that spanned broad spectrums of the social ladder. I think that Winstone does an admirable job of playing Henry as the dynamic narcissistic sociopath that he was.  Henry's absolute inability to incorporate the concerns of anyone else's lives into his decision calucli is one of the aspects that made him seem larger than life, and his torment over his status with God makes him human.  He was not a good man, nor a kind one, nor an honest one, but Winstone makes you care about him anyway.  Henry lived life voraciously, participating in his own tournaments, gorging himself on food and drink and women, writing books and sonnets and songs.  This is one of the few films I have seen which, at least to some extent, begins to do justice to that Henry.

As for the portrayals of his wives, I was moved by Assumpta Serna's expression of Katherine of Aragon, and by the tenderness exhibited in her early relationship with Henry.  She was a woman of great dignity, spirituality and kindness, and she is portrayed, not as a difficult woman trying to trip up her ex, but as the soul-searching daughter of the church that she was.

The reason I did not give this film 5 stars is Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Anne, which is one of the weakest evocations I have seen.  Partly a fault of the script-writing, Bonham Carter shows an Anne which is neither decisive enough to definitively know what she wants, nor principled enough to make you want her to get it.  My favorite portrayal of Anne Boleyn is in ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" where Genevieve Bujold plays her with tremendous passion and sympathy.  Still, as the film progresses, Bonham Carter improves her performance--by the time Anne is executed, you really are sorry to see her go.

Jane Seymour is not portrayed as a ""nag"", as one reviewer asserts, nor does she ""meddle.""  In reality, she did encourage Henry to show his softer side toward his daughters, and reached out to both Mary and Elizabeth.  Maybe that's what is being characterized as ""nagging"".  I don't know.  Although we'll never know how she felt about the slaughter of Robert Aske, I think it would be fair to say that she would have been preturbed by it.  I don't think it's too much artistic license to take to show her grow agitated over the news.  I think it's unlikely Henry would have struck her when she was pregnant.  But I'm not going to throw a fit over that, either.  I liked the portrayal of the relationship, and thought overall it illustrated Jane's submission to Henry and her deferral to his wishes.  By the way, Henry's later observations about Jane and his fond remembrances of her would naturally have been tainted by his looking through rose-colored goggles - since she was the only wife who provided him with a son.  As Alison Weir noted in her exceptional book ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"", later in life when Henry had a family portrait painted, he put Jane Seymour, then long dead, in the picture with him.

Anne of Cleves is given the role in Henry's life that she played: that of a minor character whose importance was greater to Cranmer than anyone else.  Katherine Howard is portrayed rather well as the vacuous, unintelligent beauty that it appears she was in reality.  'Nuff said.

Catherine Parr is a minor character, but Clare Holman played her beautifully.  I also especially enjoyed Sean Bean's role as Robert Aske, who leads the doomed Catholic rebellion.  I think that the Duke of Norfolk, who truly was a villain, is captured as such, and the internal court intrigues are fascinating.

The sets are rich in color and variation, and the cast seems well-matched to one another.  I am actually astonished that this film did not garner more appreciation from the viewers in these pages.  I will certainly watch it again.",1132185600,10,6475,4.682581786030062
1925666,1,B0000DK4NO,"I have little to add to the other reviewers, who categorize this production's inadequacies most effectively.  I merely want to emphasize the abysmal casting and mis-casting; take one example -- Emilia Fox was fine in ""The Pianist.""  She just doesn't belong here.  And as for Winstone?  Well, Henry VIII had his vulgar side but he was profoundly concerned with the stature and dignity of his office and was not inclined to let his guard down in public. He was every inch a king, not every inch the bouncer down the pub.

Fortunately, relief is at hand in the form of the 1969 BBC 6-parter which towers over this travesty and manages to get pretty much all of the details right.  That legendary production is a miracle of fine writing, careful thought, superb acting, and judicious casting (Bernard Hepton was born to play Cranmer, and don't forget Basil Dignam as the awful Gardiner).

In fact, the producers admitted to the very flaw of this film as their intention, to make Henry VIII a modern day gangster. Tony Soprano as King of England.

Part two, which features Henry in his later years, is much better than part one, but all in all, I still felt this was far too modern an approach to history.

The actor playing Henry sounded like some ""puir bloodie bullie"" from Manchester or parts further north. The real Henry grew up among intellectuals (Henry was in his own right, a scholar, theologian, musician, poet, sportsman and amateur physician/apothecary.) in a court that held its own with France and Spain in courtesy and sophistication.
The film rightly shows that Henry VII and Henry VIII were suspicious of any person having a claim on the English throne, but Henry VIII did not slaughter the Duke of Buckingham and his adherents in a wood. Buckingham died on the scaffold for treason, but his rebellion was nipped in the planning stages. (If there was one. It could have been a plot by Cardinal Wolsey to be rid of a nobleman who whispered in the king's ear against him.)

1925670,2,B0000DK4NO,"If you've seen the 1970's production with Keith Mitchell as Henry VIII, you're ruined forever from appreciating any other version. It's unbeatable with well drawn characters and superb acting. You really can't write a critique of this newer version without comparison to the 70's version. This version of Henry VIII isn't as gory as depicted by some reviewers e.g., Boleyn's bloody head held high for onlookers to see, some sword fights, a joust and the leader of the catholic insurrection bloodied topsy turvey. Who wants to watch gore anyway (yeah right). We want at least some semblance of historical accuracy and fine performances. Ray Winstone as Henry VIII has less of a cockney accent in the film than he does in the special interview section on the DVD. He did tone it down considerably so I have no argument with that. His Henry though is a narcissistic egomaniac, psychotic in his quest to keep his promise to his father, a promise that provided for a male heir. Today, he would be taken kicking and screaming from the castle, institutionalized and probably for the remainder of his life. Trumped up charges against Anne Boleyn led her to the axe, a vile Henry thrusting another wife to the floor while she was pregnant therefore resulting in her demise, another wife portrayed as a slut and adulteress leading her to the axeman etc. The man had no mercy for others, so in the end when he's near death you have no sympathy for him. Most importantly, there were no contradictions in Henry's character that made the viewer think about how a man of such intelligence and often gentleness could be so cruel, murder two wives and try and have history see his spanish queen as a slut and their children bastards. The 70's version provided wonderfully portrayed characters who even when you detested them you also felt some kind of pain for, especially Henry portrayed magnificently by Keith Mitchell. I would also have liked to have seen more script for Catherine of Aragon. I think she was really the most fascinating queen of them all and with a will of iron. One gets the feeling that if she had been sent to the axe, she wouldn't have publicly praised Henry as all the others did before the axe ended their lives. This wasn't even fun to watch. The 70's version at least had some fine areas of humor. Henry too was shown in that production as an intelligent man curious about the world about him. There's no such Henry in this newer version. As for Helena Bonham Carter as Anne Boleyn, costumed in some kind oF frizzy material either wrapped around her head or hanging off of one side of her head, reminded me more of Miss Faversham than the allegedly seductive Anne. Her costumes were dreadful. In fact, often Henry's costumes looked made on the cheap. Bonham-Carter was miscast. Whether true or not, we've come to think of Anne Boleyn, because of her reputation as ""The Great Whore"", more than just attractive but with that special quality a woman exudes that makes her appear as beautiful even if she's plain. Bonham-Carter, no matter how you dress her up is always plain and her costumes dominate her, not the other way around.

1925673,3,B0000DK4NO,"3 stars is perhaps a little generous, especially if one is basing her review on historical accuracy. and historically accurate it is not. aside from missing some key elements (namely: thomas moore, lady rochford's ultimate fate, and a large slice of anne of cleves), other aspects are just plain wrong - for instance, anne boleyn and katherine howard's executions on tower hill, not within the walls on tower green (come now, people), jane seymour is a little more assertive than sources would suggest, and katherine howard appears a bit reluctant to go, despite the substantiated offer that she admit to a precontract with dereham (also missing) and void her marriage to the king, thereby saving her life. other signature moves were also noticeably absent: anne boleyn's hair hangs down in her face for a majority of the movie and is not held back by the hallmark french hood, alas she also never says the wonderful, if not precisely corroborated ""your wife i cannot be, your mistress i will not be"" line - though she more or less conveys the notion. the nun of kent does not make an appearance and neither does anne askew. katherine parr and henry appear to have a rather placid arrangement towards the end - there is no threat to parr and henry is at least somewhat mobile toward the end of his life. also disappointing was the absence of katherine howard's famed run through hampton court, shouting after henry.

well, yes there is all that. but i do love tudor england and will watch just about anything produced on the subject. though heralded as ""henry viii"", this is really a movie about the king's relationships with his wives (and yes, his obsession for a son) and is not a film about the entirety of the king's reign. you miss all of the events preceeding the eviction of catherine of aragon.

i expected all of this and accommodated my expectations for such. it is an entertaining slice of time, which i am sure i will repeat, given the tudor-phile that i am. ray winstone gives a rather sympathetic portrayal of henry while still suddenly turning him into a raging madman. the actor who played norfolk was decent, probably from previous practice, as i swear i've seen him in this same role before. still, there are some irregularities that almost spoil the fun. sadly to say, even the costumes are not that spectacular. helena bonham carter unfortunately looks a little truncated and, well, boxy in her weirdly-done bodices. if you enjoy period pieces, especially tudor england and can forgive the historical atrocities, then i would recommend the netflix version of viewing.",1104192000,6,2588,4.826576576576577
1925674,1,B0000DK4NO,"I was eagerly looking forward to this.  Boy, was I disappointed. I'm a scholar of the 16th century and have been captivated by Henry VIII's court and wives.  Especially Anne Boleyn.  I have read every biography of the wives and Henry.  I hate anachronisms and this drama was full of them.  I hate historical inaccuracies and we had plenty of those.  I agree with one reviewer who said Henry was over 6 feet tall, and although bluff and hearty, he was cultured and elegant until he became ill and irascable and disillusioned.  No one ever gets Catherine of Aragon correctly.  I think Annette Crosby came closest in the first PBS six wives to her personality and coloring.  Catherine was very tiny, under 5 feet tall, auburn haired and blue eyed.  As she bore children, she lost her figure and grew heavy.  However, filmakers insist in casting dark haired ladies who are tall and slim.  Anne Boleyn eludes them completely.  She was slim and ""above middle height"" with dark hair and deep brown eyes.  She was charming, bright, witty and talented, both musically and vocally.  They always portray her as a shrew.  She captivated Henry and excited him.  Jane Seymour was demure and quiet and very, very plain.  Has anyone looked at Holbein's portrait???  Anyway I won't go on.  It's all just more of the same.  One great big disappointment.",1103241600,47,1335,4.74235807860262
1925675,1,B0000DK4NO,"Sad to say, this is numbingly bad, best passed over in silence. In general, this disappointing (yet expensive) production appears to continue down the path of the recent (and awful) big screen version of ""Elizabeth"", where the talents of Cate Blanchett were totally wasted and in which historical accuracy was simply jettisoned in favour of camp, the resulting mess actually containing much less compelling drama than the historically faithful version would have. We know that Tudor monarchs didn't speak Oxbridge English, but were they really cockneys, as Henry is portrayed here? There are some disturbing, gratuitous and perversely gloating bloody execution scenes as well and the actors are often placed in truly laughable situations. The script distorts history so badly that it is not even worth trying to untangle it here. Pity poor Thomas Cromwell, for example, who is portrayed here as nothing more than an evil, inept buffoon. Whoever cast these actors as leading lights of the Tudor court should have at least looked at Holbein's portraits of many of them. These actors don't resemble them at all. Poor Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Anne Boleyn as the wronged but unreasonably understanding wife. Her final (quite unhistorical, by the way) scene with baby Elizabeth plumbs new depths of bad taste, outdone only by her execution scene, complete with bloody head.

Despite its being thirty-five years old, Keith Michell's portrayal of Henry for the still admirable BBC series is the one to watch, while the resemblance of a host of fine British actors to known likenesses of Tudor courtiers is simply uncanny (especially Cromwell and Cranmer). Why can't someone today do a good job on Tudor history, given how far our knowledge of the period has advanced since the 1970's, the last time the subject was tackled convincingly? The opportunity still remains unexplored, alas, and this present effort probably means that it will be some time before it is attempted again. Too bad.",1101945600,19,1987,5.151702786377709
1925676,3,B0000DK4NO,"While it's hard to imagine any work comparable to the now famous 1970s BBC miniseries with Keith Michell, this ambitious and beautifully filmed movie treats the legend of ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" with a modern dash of Melrose Place.

If you're simply a fan of all things Henrician, you'll enjoy this melodrama...if you're a stickler for historical accuracy, you probably will not.

Bonham Carter is an appealing Anne Boleyn, although I don't know why such an intelligent actress spents so much time rolling her eyes...  ""Catherine Howard"" is Kate Winslet-inspired gorgeous... Winstone as Good Old King Harry, himself, tries valiantly throughout, but comes off more as a football bloke (Sean Bean as ""Aske"" could have been a more interesting casting choice in the title role).  ""Cromwell"" is god-awful and ""Anne of Cleves"" all but ignored.  ""Parr"" is very good albeit virtually invisible.  Interesting actress as ""Catherine of Aragon.""  ""Jane Seymour"" woefully miscast.

Erratic direction.  Beautiful wardrobe and music.  The sole ""Special Feature"" is unenlightening and uninspiring.",1101340800,6,1087,5.416666666666667
1925677,4,B0000DK4NO,"As an historian, I was a bit disappointed with the latest recreation of the lives and wiles of Henry VIII, arguably one of the most important figures in British history.  The nursery rhyme is well known - Henry the Eighth was six times wedded; two he divorced, two beheaded...

This production, written by Peter Morgan (known for other television productions such as `The Jury') and directed by Pete Travis (also of `The Jury', also `Other People's Children'), is a period piece that largely rests on one primary theme - that Henry VIII was charged by his father with one task above all others, and that was to secure the succession for another Tudor.  Since this was a world in which (supposedly) a queen could not rule in her own right, this required a male heir to the throne (of course, it would be Henry's own offspring that would change that assumption, for the better, and for ever).

Henry's quest to gain a male heir knew no bounds; by the time his obsession had destroyed many lives (not just those of the unfortunate women he married), he was an overweight and overbearing man with not too many years left to live.  His succession of wives is made all the more dramatic by the speed of the unions - between his first divorce from Catherine of Aragon in 1533, he had five more wives in the span of only 10 years, the last one to last until his death in 1547.  The women came into favour and fell out of favour quickly, sometimes due to infidelity and political intrigue, and sometimes due to the quirky whims of Henry.

It is this quirkiness that is highlighted in Ray Winstone's performance.  Winstone is not well known to American audiences, but a regular fixture on British television and cinemas.  Henry is presented as a brash, lustful, but often boyishly-innocent figure, vulnerable and wounded by others around him, especially the wives, if they do not live up to his expectations or desires of loving him for himself.  The cast of women portraying the wives is impressive, including the award-winning Helena Bonham Carter as Anne Boleyn, Emilia Fox as Jane Seymour, and Clare Holman as Catherine Parr.  If you think you recognise the voice of the narrator, you probably do - it is that of Shakespearean Derek Jacobi.

The sets, costumes, and other atmospheric pieces are well done and appropriate to the context.  But this is an actor's piece, driven by dialogue, and here is falls a little short of fully satisfying.  The characters are a bit too much of caricatures; they overemphasise certain strengths and weaknesses, and do not play as balanced figures (even for the imbalanced people that history tells us they were).  This is meant to draw the tragedy of Henry's life out, and his role as more sinned against than sinning in many parts of the film play.

Well worth watching, the viewer who expects an undistorted history lesson will be disappointed.  However, in the `some events have been changed for dramatic purposes' world of acting, it does help to cause some reconsideration here and there of all the events of the time.  History is as much a record as it is interpretation.  This is one.",1101168000,70,3120,4.712707182320442
1925678,1,B0000DK4NO,"I agree with many of the reviewers here. One even mentioned Tony Soprano as the inspiration for Ray Winstone's horrid performance. Give Tony Soprano a cockney accent, died red hair, and you have Ray Winstone. I have to admit I thought about James Gandolfini througout the entire time watching this.  I am truly disgusted with the barrage of historical inaccuracies in historical period films, some I can tolerate, but this was not one of them.  The miscasting of Ray Winstone was perhaps the largest blunder - he was short, could not provide any sort of ""majestical dignity"", and did not for one minute convince me of Henry VIII.  The wives did not carry the movie either.  Helena Bonham Carter was pregnant during the filming, and her large girth was evident and poorly hidden.  It was distracting when you are picturing a petite attractive woman, and Helena Bonham Carter has a larger waistline than Henry!! I cringed when they had Anne Boleyn say goodbye to  the three year old Elizabeth in the tower, that was the most gut wrenching inaccuracy of many.  The only part I enjoyed was the last minute or so when the narrator, stating that Henry VIII, despite his quest for a male heir, did have a glorious heir in the form of a daughter, Elizabeth I.",1100908800,16,1251,4.684931506849315
1925679,1,B0000DK4NO,"In reading some of these reviews, I wonder if we had seen the same movie.

Even if I did not have a degree in history, the terrible inaccuracies and inconsistencies would have been apparent to even a casual historical buff.  It is so bad I don't know where to begin.

Henry VIII came across as a blue collar worker who dutifully goes bowling every Saturday night.  There was not even a rudiment of royal aspect to this character; whether or not it was due to the terrible miscasting of the actor (one of many; more about that later) or a clueless director, one can only guess.  If I didn't know the main events and personages of this period, even a scorecard wouldn't have helped me understand what was going on.

Major historical events simply flew by without any rhyme, reason or explanation.  At least in some productions, actors are sought who bear some resemblance to the actual person.  In this case, an attempt to do so must have been thrown out the window.  Henry VIII was over 6 ft tall according to his skeleton unearthed in the 1800s.  In this movie almost everybody towers over him, in an age when most men were around 5'6""-5'8"" in height.  And the rest--Wolsey, Cromwell, Cranmer--not one of the actors bore any recognizable resemblance at all to their historical personages, and in most cases were the exact opposites.  And why the crewcuts?

The personalities of Henry's wives were many and varied remarkably from one to the other.  This movie, however, took that fact of their differences in individual traits to a ludicrous extreme.  At times, they were downright incorrect.  Jane Seymour was way too overbearing, talkative and meddling.  In reality, Henry had been initially captivated by her because she was quiet and unassuming.  Catherine Howard was a promiscuous young girl, but I doubt she exhibited such sauciness in Henry's very presence.  Didn't anybody involved in this fiasco read a history book?

Skinny dipping in Tudor England?????????

I cannot finish this review without commenting on the total lack of  knowledge of the time period.  Didn't anyone know that women, especially those of the upper class, NEVER appeared in public without the sometimes elaborate headresses of the period?  The only exception would be when a woman was crowned; she would ride to her coronation with her hair loose.  Otherwise, women generally hid their tresses under headpieces and scarves.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the young Lady Mary in public without any head covering; likewise Catherine Howard.

What makes this especially disappointing is that usually the British are sticklers for historical accuracy.  Can someone tell me what happened with this movie?  Are they no longer teaching English History in the schools?

This sad movie is nothing but an elaborate soap opera set in Tudor England and altering the principles to such a degree that one had to guess whom they were portraying.

If you know very little about history, please do not use this movie as a starting point in your education.  As for those of us who have made an intense study of Tudor England--this film isn't even good enough for a laugh.  History massacred!  This production does not really even merit one star, but the scoring method does not give me the option of a ""0"".",1100908800,115,3276,4.853790613718411
1925680,2,B0000DK4NO,"I can handle a historically muddled presentation like this...that is, if it is presented fairly well.  But this production just isn't all that good, not on any level.  Just like many other reviewers have mentioned, a number of the principals, most notably Bonham Carter, turned in performances that range from the bizarre to the utterly disengaged.  Bonham Carter's performance rendered the historical Anne Boleyn unrecognizable to anyone familiar with the period.

Of course, this would fit in with the production as a whole.  It is nothing new for these costume dramas to presume intimate knowledge on the part of the viewer of the historical period in question.  This production goes farther than most in putting demands on most viewers, even those who are reasonably well-aquainted with the Tudor period.  I would like to think that I have a decent enough grounding in that period, but there were more times than I can count that I was yanking Scarisbrick off the shelf to try and figure just what the hell was going on.

All in all, this really was an unsatisfying experience, both from a historical & dramatic point of view.  There are definitely better television productions of Henry VIII that have been available for years now, and discriminating viewers will seek them out before turning to this mediocre effort.",1100649600,10,1322,5.0
1925681,2,B0000DK4NO,"Boy was this disappointing.  Like most fans of this period I looked forward to this new version.  Bah humbug.  Ray Winstone seemed to be auditioning for a gangster movie and there were too many inaccuracies.

The original Six Wives series (a very early Masterpiece Theatre production, I think) with Keith Michell is much better.

For historical accuracy the Starkey version is very interesting and gives a better view of both the characters and their time.",1100563200,6,456,5.026666666666666
1925682,1,B0000DK4NO,"I feel somewhat disgusted that I lent two evenings of my life to watching this terrible film. Although it appeared on PBS's Masterpiece Theater, I wouldn't call this a masterpiece by anyone's definintion.

I am a history buff, but not a historian, and yet I spent most of this movie picking it apart as it was inaccurate on too many things to list.

I could have probably overlooked the inaccuracies if it had at least been well acted or interesting, but it was neither. The acting was mediocre, Ray Winstone seemed to be channeling Tony Soprano for his bizarre portrayal of Henry the VIII. Helena Bonham Carter phoned in her performance of Anne Boleyn.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend instead that you get Starkey's closer to historically accurate and far more interesting ""Six Wives of Henry the VIII"".",1100563200,6,835,4.784722222222222
1925683,4,B0000DK4NO,"Enjoyed this latest protrayal of Henry VIII.  While nothing can match the chemistry between Anne and Henry from Anne of a Thousand Days....this was very good.  I know a few people have commented about Ray Winstone's accent not being as refined as it  should have been for his part , but I didn't mind. I was busy looking at a man trying to find love, yet could not be faithful himself and  consumed with having a male heir to the point of destruction to himself and those around him.  While his behavior as a ruler may appear to some as brutal this was the norm for the times.  As someone else commented, enjoy the production for what it was.  If you do,  I think you will have enjoyed (once again) some of the best productions  of historical drama as performed so ably by our British friends.",1100563200,2,793,4.376712328767123
1925684,4,B0000DK4NO,"I found this TV production though not ""historical,"" highly entertaining, 90% of it because of Ray Winstone's Henry VIII. He paints a portrait full of masculine vigor, with enough lust in his heart for at least a dozen men, and his tough guy East End accent somehow works well too, though it is quite a change from the Richard Burton/King's English type of Henry VIII I have previously seen.
There are scenes where he is memorable, like the emotion he expresses after Anne Boleyn (Helena Bonham Carter) gives birth to Princess Elizabeth.
In his old age Henry becomes a sad and sickly figure, and Winstone realistically catches that aspect of him too.
The rest of the large cast is also good, which includes David Suchet as Cardinal Wolsey, and Sean Bean in a role that is not long, but one of his most powerful, as Robert Aske, who goes against the king for having committed the brutal ""dissolution of the monasteries.""

The plot starts in 1509, with the death of Henry VII, and the young Henry VIII marrying Katherine of Aragon, but quickly segues to 1524, and centers on the last 21 years of Henry's life, with still no male heir from Katherine, enter Anne Boleyn and the other wives, court intrigue, and manipulations by Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell among those vying for power.
It is also quite gritty and bloody, and not for the young or squeamish, including muddy, violent  battle and jousting scenes, lots of heads being chopped off, and even a dog fight, which fortunately is more heard than seen.

Well paced direction by Pete Travis, script by Peter Morgan, cinematography by Peter Middleton, and score by Robert Lane, make this an engrossing, if not historically accurate film, and since the core of this production are the intimate scenes, artistic license is to be expected.
Total running time is 250 minutes.",1100390400,5,1828,4.796825396825397
1925685,1,B0000DK4NO,"I was looking forward to this movie, as I love anything to do with the Tudors, and find the time period fascinating, as well as the bizarre monarchy!  However, this movie leaves everything lacking.  Let's start with the music.  Lovely, but far too familiar.  They stole it from Gladiator!  I was wondering why I could anticipate the next note! Also some music and scenes were stolen from the movie Elizabeth.  Truly, no need for this.  A little original creativity, please!  Helena Bonham Carter is usually quite good in her roles, but she showed no emotion, and her perfomance is dull and flat compared to Anne in ""Anne of the Thousand Days.""  She never comes off as convincing, nor powerful, as the real Anne Boleyn was.  Henry seemed weak, as well, and the whole story is a Reader's Digest version, which, unless you are familiar with Tudor history, makes it very difficult for a viewer to truly understand the politics between Church and State, in those days, and how the chaos influenced life at Court and beyond.  I had thought I would purchase this, but won't bother, afterall, which is too bad.  For movies, stick to Anne of the Thousand Days, Lady Jane, and Elizabeth.  For accurate history, get David Starkey's The Six Wives of Henry VIII DVD, which will be time well spent.  Sorry!",1100217600,23,1292,4.709821428571429
