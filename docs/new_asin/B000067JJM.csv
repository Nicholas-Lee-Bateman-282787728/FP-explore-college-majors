1718092,5,B000067JJM,This moive isn't so bad if you go into it knowing what to expect. A low budget badly acted c-rated horror flick.  The whole movie sound like it was recorded in a well. The acting lacks direction the movie seems to have no plot. And I don't think these people have heard of lighting or marks. Still if you know all this coming in and don't actully expect a horror flick like I did then you can laugh yourself silly.  This movie was so bad it was good. I couldn't stop laughing.  The funniest thing about this movie was that they actully wanted you to be scared. They were honestly trying to make a movie.,1064966400,4,603,4.226086956521739
1718093,5,B000067JJM,"I can truly say, with neither fear nor trepidation, that this movie is the best movie ever to be created by the human race.
True, there is no acting to speak of, no plot, no editing, no discernable script, bad lighting, sound, and overall quality, but if you can watch this entire movie without collapsing into hysterics for at LEAST the last half hour, then you are probably no longer among the living.
I have never been happier with a purchase; this movie has added years to my life, and cured my various diseases.  Buy it now, lest you miss out!",1047513600,8,548,4.425742574257426
1718094,1,B000067JJM,"This is easily one of the worst movies to come around on a direct to video basis in a long time.  You see when you rent a movie that is direct to video, especially horror, one must anticiate a certain level of cheesiness.  However there are certain movies that should not have been released, certain movies that no matter what reason there is it just should not be released.  This is one of them.
Ax'em is about a mentally retarded killer out to avenge his family murder 13 years ago.  For whatever reason he picks a group of teens who decide to go to a cabin.  Makes little sense I know,  but most times in cheesiness factor it's forgivable.  However I swear to god that this was a high school theater project.  It was done by a camcorder!!!  The sound is horriic and half the time you can't hear what it is they are saying (which is probably a good thing).  Oh and when I mean a high School theater project I mean early 90's because for a 15 minute segmant you have one guy spouting out ""Your Momma So..."" Jokes.
Overall this is easily one of the dumbest ideas to have been released.  If you would be better off making your own movie than watching this.  I mean it, DON""T WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!!",1045008000,6,1195,4.285714285714286
1718095,1,B000067JJM,"but this movie has got to be the worst horror movie.  I'll see bad review on other horror movies and I'll still watch them for the fun of it.  This movie was so bad that the laughter stopped about 1/4th of the way through.  Then we tried to watch because we wanted to see these irritating, bad-acting, mumbling people get killed.  But the deaths were [bad], the killer was a joke, the sound [was horrible], quality was non-existent and did I mention that these people couldn't act.  The fact that they even tried was bad enough.  To top it all off, I can't even tell what the hell happened.  Forget about Plan 9 From Out of Space being the worst movie, but at least it's fun to watch (sometimes).  I would try to credit these people as making this [stuff] while [under the influence], but no self respecting [individual] would have put this out.
Ax'em probably refers to each and every copy of this video.",1041724800,,905,4.442424242424242
1718096,1,B000067JJM,"If you like pain and suffering, then I HIGHLY recommend watching this.  There aren't enough words to describe to the agony. If a 3 month old baby made this film, then the explaination for the quality of this movie would be understandable.  However, these were grown people.  These people had a ""movie budget,"" ""plot,"" ""script,"" ""actors,"" and an ""experienced crew.""  The overall result was a ""worse than normal"" student film.
On the flip side....
If you need to relax your mind, have a good laugh, or just want to build mental endurance, then watch this movie.",1039996800,5,559,4.791666666666667
1718097,1,B000067JJM,this film is a worse quality than a VHS. the plot is horrible and they could of gotten 2nd graders to play better roles.,1034467200,3,120,4.041666666666667
1718098,1,B000067JJM,"I have seen some horrible movies in my day i.e. Kolobos, Battlefield Earth, The 6th Day, Final Destination, Rabid Grannies and countless others. But this one probably takes the cake. Word on the street is that awards are given to anyone who can sit through this entire movie. When i first started the DVD the movie began immediatly, no menu. i thought perhaps it was a preview, or a joke. i will start off talking about the film quality, which to be called sub par would be the understatement of the year. i have seen 1970's home videos that look like lord of the rings compared to this. on to the acting and script. in the rare occasion that you can hear the script over the terrible music and insistant hiss, which was set about 50 decipels above the talking, you will wish that the hiss covered that too. The ""acting"" in this movie is similar to skits people do with the camcorders when improvising. the plot in this ""movie"" is unknown to me, seeing as i fast forwarded through most of it. i admit, i will watch a terrible movie on purpose sometimes, just for laughs, this flick was beyond laughing though. i hope you aren't foolish and buy, or even rent this movie, in fact, it wasn't worth the time i spent typing this review.",1029456000,3,1231,4.427312775330397
1718099,1,B000067JJM,"Too bad there isn't a ""ZERO"" rating on here. I'm surprised this heap of garbage ever got released. First of all i would just like to say that i love B-Movies and Low-Budget films if they are done well, or at least half way entertaining. I have seen thousands of movies in my life and this ranks as one of the absolute WORST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND! The funny thing is that some moron who did the opening text about the murder couldn't even spell correctly, so that started me thinking ""what kind of an IDIOT could let the opening text be so stupidly misspelled"". Plus, it looks like it was shot on a VHS camera. The lighting is truly HORRIBLE throughout the film. Secondly, the acting is some of the most pathetic i have ever witnessed. Additionally, the plot???...a pre-schooler could have come up with a better one! I truly regret wasting my time watching this pathetic ""effort"". Whoever was involved in the making of this film should go back to flipping burgers. Don't just trust my words, go watch it and i'll bet you a fortune you'll agree that this movie is cow dung.",1028332800,5,1080,4.459595959595959
1718150,1,B000067JJM,"In my lifetime I have seen bad movies, but when speaking of BAD MOVIES, this is a genuine work of art. When I found out this crap even existed I was on I-mockery.com looking through the movie review section. When I saw the name I knew this movie was bad, but my sense of caution was distracted when I saw the box cover. A man looking at you and an ax stuck in a tree stump, pretty normal right? So I go out and rent it and as soon as I put the DVD in, I knew the movie was corny for the simple fact that it had NO MENU SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!! It went straight to the film with no hestation. I wish the disc was broken so I didn't have to waste an hour and a half of my life. THE FIRST SCENE OF MURDER WAS THE WORST SCENE IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIES. There is an old man in a house screaming a cursing; I think he is but you can't really tell bacause THE AUDIO SOUNDED LIKE THE MOVIE WAS FILMED UNDER WATER; then all of a sudden you see the killers point of view with the cheesiest special effects i've seen with my eyes that I punished! So the old man is shown again then a door slams. He goes to get a gun while he is still cursing, and THE KILLER GRABS HIM AND LOWERS HIS AX EVER SO GENTLY ONTO HIS HEAD, while the old man is screaming OOOOHHHHHHHHHHH SHI########!! The funny thing about that scene and thinking about the movie title, after that first murder scene, he never used an ax again. THIS MOVIE IS CALLED AX EM RIGHT???!!?? Anyways, to make a long story short, this movie is so bad that i'm not even going to abuse myself by telling you anymore about this GOD AWFUL FILM! I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF WATCHING PAINT DRY THEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE. THE DIRECTOR OF THIS FILM (Michael Mfume) SHOULD BE STONED TO DEATH BY ROGER EBERT AND SENT TO THE AFTER LIFE TO BE TOURCHERED BY GENE SISKEL IN THE ETERNAL FIRE OF SATAN'S DEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1124582400,3,1848,4.121883656509695
1718151,1,B000067JJM,"Okay, this is officially THE worst movie ever made. I'VE made better stuff than this for high school classes. Why was this made? Why was there a 15 minute scene involving a step team and a load of ""Yo Mama"" jokes that the viewer can't hear due to a slight ineptitude with a boom mike? WHY IS THERE A CHARACTER NAMED BREAKFAST? I really don't understand this. This movie is horrible, and this is coming from a guy who owns and cherishes a copy of I EAT YOUR SKIN. Now THERE'S an entertaining bad movie. THIS, however, is not even laughably bad. This hurts me. This hurts me so much. Please, don't buy this movie. Go for a walk. Read a good book. Take your significant other out to a dinner at Arby's. Just DO NOT, EVER, watch this movie. I'm begging you.",1112486400,4,753,4.2727272727272725
1718152,1,B000067JJM,Ax Em is by far the worst horror movie or movie Iv'e ever seen next to House of the Dead. The movie starts out with a man with an ax that kills a old man(offscreen)and the opening credits show a bunch of black kids dancing and then black kids visitng the woods and then a killer stalks them. The movie is boring and unintentionally hilarious and even the background music is rap and the acting makes High Schoolers look professional compared to this mess. A terrible movie also gets some really awful video quality because the picture is blurry and colors bleed in each scene. Please avoid this trash and rent something better. Even for a no-budget horror indie flick this one is a real blunder.,1109548800,,695,4.523809523809524
1718153,1,B000067JJM,"I don't know where to start with this review... there are so many things wrong with this movie that I cannot hope to mention even 1 percent of them.  Let's try though:

The video on this steamer looks like it was shot with a hand-held VHS camcorder... and a VERY cheap one at that, you know, the kind you get at a pawn shop for $3.25 and still feel cheated.  It appears that the guy edited the movie with the ""pause method"" on two VCRs, playing the ""movie"" on one VCR and recording it on the other one and pausing where he wanted edits.  The more brilliant editing the guy did, the more the picture degraded... a friend of mine and I watched the VHS version of the movie, but I am certain that the DVD also looks like a 75th generation VHS copy of a 100th generation copy of an original that was submerged in some sort of pancake syrup.

The sound is barely audible throughout this masterpiece and, although this might actually be a good thing in the context of this film, the dialog in movies should usually be audible.  You would have thought that he would have really wanted his audience to hear the ""yo mama"" jokes, but Mfume isn't even competent enough to pull that off.  One little bit of dialog you could hear plainly is the director saying ""cut"" at one point... I guess he didn't hit the pause button quick enough during his 2-VCR editing job.

The ""acting"" is worse than anything ever put on film... one would be hard pressed to find a worse film made by 10 year-old kids who have found their dad's video camera.

Luckily, the movie was only 70 minutes or so and only about 60 minutes of that was actual ""movie"" time, as the first 10 minutes or so were pointlessly filled with some sort of lame, ghetto college talent show or something that consisted of a lot of idiots acting like idiots and saying things that couldn't really be heard because the microphone on the video camera wasn't sensitive enough to pick up their brilliant dialog.

The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it ended.  I am not sure why Amazon doesn't have a negative star rating, as this movie is not even deserving of a zero rating.

I am not kidding when I say that the worst of Ed Wood's movies looks like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of excrement.  DO NOT buy or rent this movie... hell, don't even look at it or touch the box.",1105315200,2,2338,4.322654462242563
1718154,1,B000067JJM,"My first attempt at submitting a review for this film was rejected due to ""inappropriate content"".  I will now submit a second review, this one without as much venom.

This is the greatest film of all time.  Yimou, Kurosawa, Hawks, Ford, Bunuel have nothing on The Maestro who reached up straight into Heaven and pulled down this wonderful bundle of unicorn kisses.

Boldly adding misspelled words to the opening credits he defies you to understand his unattainable cinematic genius.  No lighting, horrible sound and a $3 camera he's rebelling against the big budget studios.  Using a cast on non-actors who all talk at the same time he is breaking loose of the shackles of coherency.

And in the greatest moment in the greatest movie ever made in the universe!  Aliens couldn't make a film this good!  He leaves in the word ""Cut!""  Ahhh.  Pure ecstasy!  I feel like I'm being smothered in kittens.  Strawberry kisses and hugs for everyone!  I love you.",1101427200,9,953,4.802469135802469
1718155,1,B000067JJM,"I don't know where to start.
This movie was IMPOSSIBLE to watch. The sound was awful, the video was BAD, the death scenes were HORRENDOUS and the plot was just plain DUMB!
I see no reason to even watch this movie.. not even for the comedic impact!
The only good scene was the ""yo momma"" joke sequence, and really who wants to endure 45 minutes of BAD movie until that?
Do yourself a favor and don't buy/rent/barrow/watch this movie. It will be 90 minutes of your life that you will NEVER get back. Watch a crappy new school slasher film instead.",1089763200,2,545,4.405940594059406
1718156,1,B000067JJM,"This movie was easily the worst movie ever created. The deaths are a joke, the acting is horrendous, the dialogue is painful, the audio on some parts doesn't exist, and the cuts are childish. They didn't even try. One scene, when there is supposed to be a police car outside with flashing lights, you can clearly see a police light mounted on the wall, showing off the light. The first death of the movie is comical (but not supposed to be). There is one scene of a girl running in the woods that loops. In one scene you can see the time coding on the bottom of the screen. Getting the point? If you are into bad movies, rent this one. You're sure to get a good laugh.",1081900800,2,668,4.2265625
1718157,1,B000067JJM,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, it has no script, lame jokes, bad editing, poor acting. The worst movie. It had no plot. Don't wast your time.

7963443,1,B000067JJM,"Move over Citizen Kane, your place in history as the greatest ever is no more.  This was an example of film making at its finest. Brilliantly edited, masterfully directed in addition to Academy Award level acting, Michael Mfume takes you on an exciting and improbable journey into a smartly set microcosm of African American society.  Incredible sound, including a beautiful soundtrack give this film the ambiance audiences are looking for. Pulitzer caliber writing in adition to clear and precise camera work make this possibly the greatest film of all time.  Incredibly scary horror scenes blended with witty and smart comedy will have audiences wanting for more and more. The saddest thing about this film is that unfortunately it has to come to an end after only 75 minutes.  The fact this film did not completely sweep the 1991 Oscars is an absolutely unforgivable crime by the Academy voters.  If you have a chance to see this, do not dare pass up the opportunity.",1344902400,,970,4.92638036809816
7963444,5,B000067JJM,I reign as the Bo-Bo Movie King with this movie in my collection.

7963446,1,B000067JJM,"The opening prologue card says it all (reproduced here VERBATIM):

  On a cold winter night, in 1990
  Mr. Mason, a mean and cruel
  Towns man, left his job for Home.
  After arriving home,
  He took a shotgun
  And killed his wife and
  Kids. Then is mean man
  Killed himself.

  When the police arrived, they only
  Found the bodies of his wife,
  Daughter and younger son.
  His mentally ill son Harry
  Was not ever found.

  Legend has it, he will return
  In 13 years to revenge his family deaths.

Wow... I mean, wow: if you can't even competently compose an opening prologue, you can guess how the *rest* of the ""movie"" will be...

This is especially puzzling since the aforementioned Harry seems more interested in terrorizing a bunch of random teenagers. There may actually be some connection between these teenagers and the family homicide, but it is impossible to tell from this movie. Indeed, it is impossible to figure out nearly anything in this film due to the fact that all the dialogue was recorded on a built-in mic on a hand-held camcorder. I would also guess that this film was shot in sequence, one take per scene, with no editing. I kept expecting to see a brief jump-cut of Frasier or Fresh Prince of Bel Air, or whatever the master tape had been previously used to record off of tv before being recycled into this project...

The original title of this film was ""The Weekend it Lives"" though mysteriously it was changed to ""Ax'em."" I have no idea why: there is only one scene involving an axe (which gets GENTLY LOWERED onto its victim!) and otherwise the murders are committed with a machete and a telephone receiver(!)

There are films out there which are ""so bad they're good"" and can be seen as unintentional comedies. Only the most jaded of such aficionados would ""like"" Ax'em. I am mildly surprised to see that Aspirin isn't listed in the ""customers who bought Ax'em also bought this..."" field, as this ""film"" is a headache waiting to happen.

If you want some type of ""fear factor"" challenge to give to your friends, dare them to watch this turkey start-to-finish. Otherwise, avoid like a wet leper.",1251244800,3,2132,4.646900269541779
7963447,5,B000067JJM,"I love how bad this is. This has developed a mini-cult following in my hometown. The video and audio is even horrible in this movie. I absolutely love it.

7963448,1,B000067JJM,"I actually saw this at the Westview Theater in Maryland during Winter 1993.  The film's original title was The Weekend It Lives. It was released to Maryland theaters since its director, Michael Mfume, was (and still is) the son of Maryland politician Kweisi Mfume, who would later become president of the NAACP.  Thus when people make comments about this being shot on a 1980s' camcorder, they're probably correct.

The theatrical experience was no better than the home video one - poor picture and sound, unprofessionalism on every technical level, and a feeling of, ""Oh my goodness, anyone can get a movie released.""  The only intriguing part of the film was its title, and then they go and change that for the DVD release so people think they're going to see just another slasher flick.  This film is an insult to slasher flicks.

Of historical note only because of who directed it, Ax 'Em is as bad a film as you'll ever likely to see.  For some that will make this must viewing.",1185235200,2,983,4.680232558139535
7963449,1,B000067JJM,"Yes, it's true what all of the other reviewers are saying: this is the worst movie ever made.  It's a horror movie, but for all the wrong reasons.  Here are some reasons I was horrified:

1. It's called ""Ax 'Em,"" yet there's not one murder by axe in the film (although I believe there IS a hatchet.)

2. The introduction butchers the English language so badly that you'd think it was a foreign film.

3. The beginning credits have nothing to do with the movie.  They include step-dancing and a ""Yo Momma"" contest.

4.  Most of the dialogue throughout the movie (especially during the dinner scene,) is completely incoherent.  Maybe that's a good thing, though, considering the coherent stuff is just awful.

5. The scene where Rock's glasses move up and down while he's screaming.  WTF?!

6. The line, """"Oh my God, no you did not just smack me out here in these woods!""

Okay, I have to stop now, or else I may never.  You get the gist.  I recommend that you buy or watch this movie in order to have an excellent reference point for ""The Worst Movie Ever.""

A scene-by-scene plot (I use the term ""plot"" very loosely here) analysis available at the following link: [...] but I would advise you to just take my word that this movie is bad, because even just reading about this movie could induce a migrane.

This movie is painful to watch, use it sparingly on the very worst of enemies.
