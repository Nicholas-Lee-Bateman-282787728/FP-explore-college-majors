My favorite character is Wendy Raquel Robinson aka ""Tasha Mack"" I love her because of her humor and tough love she potrays to her ""teammates""of The Game. One day I would be very pleased to meet the cast and see the backstage scenes and work from The Game. I can never get enough of it it's just awesome and exciting to see what will happen next and how it will happen and what is the conseqeunces backed up with the happenings.
