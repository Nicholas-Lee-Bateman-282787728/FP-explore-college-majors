8118260,5,B000F6ZBPS,"The greatest gun series of all time!!! If you're a fan of firearms or want to learn more about them, this series is an excellent and entertaining way to go about that... It isn't a reality show, like ""Sons of Guns"" or ""American Guns"", but rather an actual educational program, about the history of firearms.",1429056000,,307,4.6
8118261,3,B000F6ZBPS,"This DVD is a quick flick through the history of early machine guns.  The recreations, enactments and footage of early multi-shot weapons and early machineguns provide an interesting demonstration of how these guns operated but little more.

Generally the quality of the footage is pretty good.  However, within the time available no one gun is covered in great depth and generally only the basic background,  operation and some of short comings tend to be covered for most weapons.  The original Gatling gun gets some reasonable coverage and the story around the guns being sold to Russia makes for entertaining diversion.

Reasonable entertainment, but the topic is one that probably needed to have more time devoted to it to really do it justice.",1396051200,,749,5.098360655737705
