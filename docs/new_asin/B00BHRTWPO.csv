8568680,4,B00BHRTWPO,"Tony Curtis is splendid in this Scarlet Pimpernel-like swashbuckler.  Everyone else is okay, but Curtis carries the picture with a great sense of humor and elegant swashbuckling.  It's a pity that this Region 2 Italian import is pan-and-scan, but the picture is clean and one can watch it with the English soundtrack and without subtitles, if desired.",1389830400,2,351,5.140350877192983
8568681,5,B00BHRTWPO,I have wanted this movie on video or DVD for over 20 years. I even contacted (via email) someone in Hollywood and I was told that this movie had never been made available to the public. I was over the moon when I found it on Amazon. It was great to see one of Tony Curtis' early films again. The fencing scenes were amazing and the storyline simple but believable. It was every bit as good as I remembered and I am glad I spent the money getting it.,1389744000,,449,4.056179775280899
8568682,3,B00BHRTWPO,"The Purple Mask is a zorro-like story taking place during the french revolution. The mask is not much used but it is okay. The plot is good and above everything Tony Curtis does his restless, always on the move, witty and respectless  acting. He is worth the film. I would have liked to rate a star more but the product is screened for tv so you miss top, buttom and sides of the picture. There should be a law against it!",1384041600,,422,4.209876543209877
8568683,5,B00BHRTWPO,"I love this movie, despite the sometimes stilted acting. It's Curtis at his swashbuckling best, clearly on the order of the Scarlett Pimpernel, Zorro (with Douglas Fairbanks...whose fencing teacher also taught Curtis), and Batman. Please put this out in region 1 format!",1383350400,,270,5.4523809523809526
8568684,5,B00BHRTWPO,"Just a fun ""Zorro"" type movie..I love 1950's Universal  films...great color, great actors and good stories. It was my favorite studio....hence all the Tony Curtis films that I love...saw them all. They hold up really well. I remember all of them from my childhood. They're my ""feel good"" movies. This is one of my favorites.
P.S. I'm stuck in the '50's.",1378252800,,353,4.786885245901639
8568685,4,B00BHRTWPO,"I chose this rating.because I liked it.  I bought it because it also speaks in english,and it is one of tony curtis first movies.  I would
