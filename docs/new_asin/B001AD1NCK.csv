8276686,4,B001AD1NCK,Fun little black and white comedy. Good acting and film transfer and the English dubbing was well done.,1475452800,,103,4.777777777777778
8276687,3,B001AD1NCK,"Movie buffs and those fascinated by the history of cinema might enjoy this.  Others will probably find the dated ""special effects"" tacky.  In fact the only ""special effects"" were splicing film segments.  Other than that, there were no ""special effects"" at all.

The ""science fiction"", in the description, was more fiction and very little science.  Even ""fantasy"" as listed on is a bit of a stretch.

All in all, it's a cute, dated diversion.  You can do better.",1455235200,,461,4.833333333333333

Historically, this movie is a cultural lightening bolt. Made in 1957, the same year as Brigitte Bardot's first movie ""And God Created Woman"" and four years after Marilyn Monroe lit up the Hollywood screen with three consecutive hits, including ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,""  this movie, ""Girl in His Pocket,"" reflects and resembles the epoch it was made in. And it was the forerunner to the French New Wave of cinema.

All in all, the plot of the movie is standard. A nerdy, oddball scientist, played by the well known French actor Jean Marais,  invents with the help of his extremely attractive lab assistant, Genevieve Page, a way to shrink animals and people. The scientist's time in the lab is well spent, not only with test tubes but with his eye-catching helper. Nevertheless, the lab scientist is quite married to another beautiful woman. So to say the least things heat up, not just the lab burners.

This movie, for the sake of a movie, is mildly interesting. Yet what I found more compelling was the era it was made in: the Cold War and escalating nuclear weapons. Also skimpy bathing suits are displayed in this movie, just before the beach bikini craze. Science has taken over, not only in the scientist's lab, but also in the film industry. Eye-catching voluptuous beauty bombshells fill the screen: all this in 1957. So much for the skin fest that passes today on TV and the movies as daring and revolutionary; that kind of behavior was done long ago. And this movie proves it.

The movie plot was interesting enough to carry this 74-minute movie. The plot was based on science. And the power of science. Yet a movie only 74-minutes, that was quite new. Most movies then ran two hours, 120 minutes.  Years before the start of the era of epic, blockbuster, grandiose  movies with emphasis of being larger than life.

Overall, the movie itself was worth watching. Not great, but still good enough to sit through it without pressing the stop or pause remote control button. Nevertheless, I viewed it in the grand scheme of movie making history. And from that perspective, it made the movie worthwhile.",1444953600,2,2160,4.78494623655914
8276689,5,B001AD1NCK,"I had never seen this film, my husband had been talking about it for years.  When we saw it was finally available on DVD we had to snap it up.  Good quality and arrived quickly.",1373068800,2,177,4.0285714285714285
8276690,4,B001AD1NCK,This movie is from the 1950 or 1960 very goad as for it's day back then  special effect is mild not like today special effect but it's still a goad movie.,1364860800,,154,3.967741935483871
