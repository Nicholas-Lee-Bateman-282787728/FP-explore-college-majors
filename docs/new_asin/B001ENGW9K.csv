8298978,5,B001ENGW9K,"Nice video from the 50's regarding the American Way vs. communist ideology. If you were a Goldwater Republican you will find the video inspiring and the title misleading as the word 'extreme' is innappropriate and derogatory re/ American Values. If you are a marxist you would like the title. The video is what it is, a description of how capitalism worked in the 1950's in that era of American History. Informative and Entertaining.",1353715200,,433,4.945205479452055
