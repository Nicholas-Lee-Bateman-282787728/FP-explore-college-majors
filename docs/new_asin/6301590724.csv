7812709,5,6301590724,"This somewhat hard find gave me 3/5 of the 49er yrbook collection. For a couple bucks, these are the best deals of a Niner fans' life! The 89/90 is wonderfully done. Coincidentally, the America's Game version was on right after I saw this & I personally preferred the original. Each had it's own glossovers, but the vhs actually had more depth.

Of all the seasons, I enjoy this one alot. The most powerful offense of all-time & yes the Niners steamrolled everyone in 89, but there were some notable storylines & changes. Until the 49ers give us a 'present', living in the past w/these vids are the best place to be.",1239840000,,616,4.54954954954955
