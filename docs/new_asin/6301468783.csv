346929,4,6301468783,Was a very good introduction to the case.  It will leave you wanting to know more.  Stayed true to the facts.,1392854400,,109,4.142857142857143
346930,4,6301468783,"This movie is what a historical picture should be: an accurate depiction of the facts and a recreation of events as they happened, without any Monday morning quarterbacking or speculation as to what might have been. Cliff De Young was excellent as Lindbergh, and was the right age for the part, unlike  the casting in THE SPIRIT OF ST.LOUIS where the 25 year old Lindbergh was played by 49 year old Jimmy Stewart. Anthony Hopkins was great as Haputmann, and the other actors handled their parts well. The movie leaves one with the conclusion that Hauptmann was guilty, but may have had an accomplice whom he refused to name. There was simply too much evidence against Hauptmann, and the revisionist claim that he was the victim of a diabolical frame up simply does not ring true.",1318636800,5,779,4.727941176470588
346931,5,6301468783,"This made for TV movie in 1976 is a fairly accurate retelling of the story of the media circus that ensued when Charles A Lindbergh Jr. was abducted from his parents home. The O.J. Simpson case was a mere blip on the radar of world opinion compared to the international implications caused by a German immigrant kidnapping an internationally famous couple's child for profit in 1932.
  The movie has an excellent cast,(Anthony Hopkins, Joseph Cotten, Walter Pidgeon and Cliff De Young,) who in many cases resemble the historical characters. It portrays quite well the tabloid journalism that existed that prevented any semblence of a fair trial for Hauptmann.  Just as a side note, the overwhelming evidence against Hauptmann and the public's desire to provide comfort for the grieving family made the verdict a forgone conclusion.  The forensic investigation of the homemade ladder was particularly groundbreaking for its time.  The payment of the ransom money in gold certificate currency about to be withdrawn from circulation and easy to spot was problematic for Hauptmann.  The false accusations of everybody by the media from Dr. Condon to the maid, cause great anxiety and even a suicide.
  The supporting cast of Tony Roberts, Martin Balsam, Dean Jagger Keenan Wynn, Laurence Luckinbill and Sean Barbara Allen make this a quality production. I just wish somebody would put this on DVD because the viewer could get a real sense of what the family had to go through, the politics involved and the shameful behavior of the media which incited the public into a frenzy.",1304640000,8,1573,5.069767441860465
346932,2,6301468783,The tape was defective.  The Seller did not have a way to tell if it was because it was in the original container.  I have had an excellent response from the Seller in returning the tape.,1274227200,,187,4.166666666666667
346933,4,6301468783,"For all lawyers everywhere to watch! This is a very interesting view on the story of the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh II.  The pace is a little slow to begin with but this is necessary to enable the viewer to build up the story but the court case at the end is riveting! I feel that it is a basis for a very good legal argument, which I expect was the reason for the obvious gaps in the story.
The acting and direction is very good, especially from Sir Anthony Hopkins, who makes being Hauptman, the German immigrant look so easy!  His accent is especially good, especially during the court scenes.",1238630400,4,601,4.405405405405405
346934,5,6301468783,"This was one of the first videos I owned as a child. I still remember most of the lines to this day and recite them often to get a good laugh and a good nostalgic silence out of my family. I would recommend this to anyone who likes cartoons. In fact, I just purchased it tonight.",1130803200,2,279,4.0
346935,5,6301468783,"This cartoon was just adorable!  I really enjoyed it as a child, and I still do today.  It is a wonderful movie for children of all ages.  Seaburt is a cute little seal that always saves the day!",977443200,3,195,4.078947368421052
346936,4,6301468783,"It can be disturbing sometimes, to see how some sides of our society have deteriorated in the 1990's. In the 1930's  the kidnapping/killing of American hero aviator Charles Lindberg's baby represents a low point in our  humanity.
Telling this story is tough, particularly since the evidence  was all circumstantial. Whereas the 1996 film  ""Crime of the Century""  approaches the after-the-fact investigation, with a perspective that Bruno  Hauptmann (executed for the crime) indeed may have been wrongfully  convicted, this film (from 1976) pursues a more clinical, step-wise,  investigative approach. The dictum here seems to be to substantiate the  verdict within the bounds of historical accuracy.
Nice turns by Cliff  DeYoung as Charles Lindbergh, and Anthony Hopkins for his portrayal of  Hauptmann (for which he won an EMMY). The presentation is a bit dry,  confusing, and long (148mins). You might want to find a nice supplemental  text to help you better understand the main players and the chronology of  events.
But if you're unfamiliar with much of the circumstances you will  definitely want to take a look.",950400000,11,1118,5.308571428571429
7814193,4,6301468783,"I remember seeing this tele-movie as a youngster and having nightmare about it. I was happy to find it on DVD so that I could re-watch it and see it from an older perspective. I was too young originally to appreciate Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Bruno Hauptman, but he totally steals the show. This film inspired a life-long interest in the original case, and I thoroughly appreciate being able to watch it again and to add it to my movie collection. On a technical note, the film is very dated production-wise, and obviously made on a television budget. Still an interesting story that made me want to learn more about the real case.",1474502400,2,635,4.628318584070796

7814196,5,6301468783,"Very nice true story, but sad.",1448323200,,30,4.166666666666667
7814197,3,6301468783,"It's never easy dealing in a short movie with the responsibility for the Lindbergh baby murder in all its circumstantial wilderness.  That may be the reason why there have been only a couple of serious attempts.  This try, originally a video release from 1976, is the oldest but is not overly successful.  Its obvious premise is that Hauptmann was guilty: the actor playing him (Anthony Hopkins) is clearly the same guy who plays Cemetery John, the ransom taker, so that's really the end of the matter in this particular movie.  No miscarriage of justice here eh?  It's true that the movie here and there mentions facts that could mean Hauptmann was innocent - for example the police toy with the theory this was an inside job involving Lindbergh's servants - but there's no real sense that this is a very, very controversial case.  Hopkins is dour and cold in this role, thus adding to the aura that Hauptmann was the murderer.  To really get into this case, one has to read a great deal.  There are many tomes available at Amazon.  It's unreasonable to expect the subtlety of the evidence to be covered in an hour and a half on the screen.  For a more sympathetic film portrayal of Hauptmann you can watch The Crime of the Century but its not currently available on DVD.",1425254400,4,1272,4.613333333333333
7814198,4,6301468783,"A good made for tv movie that summarizes the lindbergh kidnapping case.  It was well done and well acted, just a little long in the middle of it, but still good.  If you want a movie that giives you the facts of the case, without much sensationalism, then this is it. I would advise anyone with a true interest in the case to buy it.",1403568000,2,333,4.107692307692307
7814199,5,6301468783,"I am a history buff and this case intrigued me. The Lindberg case was I think the biggest news story that had come out of the last century. The acting was top notch all around, this enactment was the most historically correct.

It is worth the watch, I can remember vaguely when this first was aired way back in 1976 but it is as excellent today as it was back then, the array of actors now since passed on is impressive. There were some twists in this case, but I do feel that the government executed the man whom was responsible for this unspeakable and heart breaking deed.",1403136000,,576,4.333333333333333
7814200,2,6301468783,This should have been a rock solid film but the casting of the two main Stars..Cliff DeYoung and Ms. Allen was a mistake!! Both are TOTALY Miscast as the Lindbergs!! DeYoung is very weak in the role and just is not at all believable as Lindberg!!! Replace these two and this could have been a really great film!!,1400889600,,312,4.396551724137931

7814202,3,6301468783,This tv-movie based on the real life case is very entertaining.  Now what it should of explored more was the possibility that there was evidence that the kidnapper had inside information.  If your looking for a great film to watch then I do recommend watching this because its never boring.  The facts however to me seemed to be played with to fit the narrative of the film,1393718400,,373,4.537313432835821
