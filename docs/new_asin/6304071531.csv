7861136,3,6304071531,Wishbone still can get a child's interest in the classic stories because they see enough to make them want to know what happens next,1390089600,,132,4.541666666666667
7861137,5,6304071531,WISHBONE does it again with Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.  Charmingly showing the major story points; and if the pirate stuff seems cliched this is the book they came from.  Well done just enjoy.,1342396800,,207,5.0588235294117645
7861138,5,6304071531,"Treasure Island (written by Robert Louis Stevenson) is such a classic story I'd be surprised if somebody hasn't heard of it. I've read the original Treasure Island, watched a few versions of Treasure Island but my favorite would have to be the Wishbone version. This is a great episode with Wishbone imagining himself as Jim Hawkins. During the voyage Jim Hawkins overhears a plan of mutiny by the ship's crew. Also, when Wanda tells Samantha about Blackbeard's horseshoe hidden in the Trumbull Barn, Samantha becomes determined to find it. When she brings along Joe, David (oh yeah and Wishbone) they all get trapped in the barn and when things can't get any worse lightning strikes and now they've got a  fire on their hands.

This is one of my favorite episodes and a story I've always found interesting. Of course this episode has some really corny pirate lines but hey it's a kid's show, and having Wishbone squeezed into the story makes up for it.

In the long run this is a great episode that I have to recommend.",1250985600,3,1020,4.687150837988827
7861139,5,6304071531,"It is always fun to look at the title/cover of a ""Wishbone"" episode and figure out what literary classic is being incorporated in this week's tale of adventure.  Of course, this week the world's most imaginative Jack Russell terrier is day- dreaming about Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island.""  However, I was a surprised which character Wishbone was playing this time around.  In ""Salty Dog"" (arrgh) Samantha (Christie Abbott) leads Joe (Jordan Wall) and David (Adam Springfield) into a dangerous adventure while searching for a treasure.  Meanwhile, Wishbone (Larry Brantley) is Jim Hawkins leading his own dangerous search for pirate gold in his own little version of ""Treasure Island.""  Wishbone knows more about great literature than any other dog since Mr. Peabody.  The ""Wishbone"" television series has found a unique way of introducing children to classic literature and encouraging a love of reading books.  This series is designed for elementary school children, but adults will enjoy the sly jokes (wink) that only those who have already read ""Treasure Island"" would ever understand.  ""Salty Dog"" (arrgh) is one of the better episodes because of the strong parallel between the main story and the novel parallel.",1009238400,7,1229,5.331606217616581
