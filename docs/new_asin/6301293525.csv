make such a movie?  Bates getting older ?  Oldman ?  My introduction to Liz  Smith - hadn't seen or heard of her
before - saw her since in film ""Hard Labour"" -- good actress, typically British.  Maybe, if they'd expanded on the gay(?)
theme, IF, IF, IF - poor Evie, no more the star, poor dear !!",1481155200,,418,4.227848101265823

7811335,5,6301293525,"If you're a pet lover, who can appreciate a little gay-iety (pun intended) thrown in for a pinch of flavor, then you'll get a real charge out of this rare gem of a movie.  Alan Bates and Gary Oldman are superb in their respective roles.  Bates is the well fixed, older, guy with a soft spot for a younger fellow - Oldman - who ends up in jail for stealing money.  After his time is served, he goes home to his very fertile wife who affords him little time with his former lover.  A frustrated Bates ends up with the 4-legged b*tch and Oldman ends up chained to the 2-legged b*tch with a growing litter of 2-legged pups.",1372377600,,619,4.220338983050848
7811336,5,6301293525,"This is a gem of a film, and a huge disappointment that it is not available on DVD.  J.R. Ackerley upon whose novel the film is based created two classic literary works concerning the love between a human being and an animal.  Ackerley's other great dog story - ""My Dog Tulip"" - was recently (2009) made as an animated film with the voices of Christopher Plummer, Lyn Redgrave and Isabella Rosselini. ""We Think The World of You"" (Br. 1988)has a similar theme involving a lonely middle aged man (Alan Bates) who comes to find that his desire for a close relationship may ultimately be fulfilled with a member of the animal species.  Alan Bates is marvellous (as always) as an upper middle class civil servant who has feelings for a younger working class man (Gary Oldman).  The film has many humourous moments, but is ultimately poignant, but also wonderfully satisfying.  This is a must for animal lovers, and those looking for a hidden cinematic treasure.",1298678400,7,956,4.7696969696969695
