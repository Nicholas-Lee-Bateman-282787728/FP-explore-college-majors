2500780,5,B000E6ES94,"The negative reviews should be discarded by any serious student of Christianity for the rejection of Christian teachings for the first 300 years after Christ's Crucifiction. ""Into the Silence"", ""Dark Night of the Soul"", and ""In the Spiritual Desert"" were all known to mean contemplative prayer among Abraham's Children of both the New & Old Covenants. Several of the reviewers cited obviously reject the writings of the gentlemen and ladies who gave us the Canon of OT & NT alike. Christ in the Gospels, and Paul in several of his letters, tell us to go into the silence of the desert so we can encounter our Creator - how - by shutting up so He can get a word in edgewise! Anthony of Egypt, Benedict, Augustine, and other greats of Eastern & Western monasticism say ""centering prayer"" as a means of ""going into your room"", without the distractions of everyday life for a few minutes, and placing yourself in God's presence mentally, spiritually and emotionally.... Not in the Bible? Yes it is - Solomon, John the Baptizer, Sampson and others all went thru the process and practice...",1147219200,24,1084,4.802139037433155
2500781,5,B000E6ES94,"The first review (positive) gave me the idea that I would enjoy this DVD in a deep and meaningful way, but it was the two negative reviews that sold me on it!  Everyone needs to be reminded that the way to God is within (yes, and Jesus even said so) and that we find the 'still small voice' of God in the silence.  Beautiful ...",1147046400,35,328,4.030769230769231
2500782,5,B000E6ES94,"BE STILL is a continual joy!  We've watched it several times.  It delves deeply into the real meaning of prayer.  Every follower of Jesus and every seeker of God should have a copy.  My wife, Doris and I wept when it was finished.  I encourage you to see this!",1146787200,28,260,4.224489795918367
2500783,1,B000E6ES94,"The Be Still DVD, just released by Fox Home Entertainment, and featuring Richard Foster, Dallas Willard, Calvin Miller and Beth Moore has one main message: You cannot know God if you do not practice the art of going into the silence. That silence the DVD refers to is a special state of mind, different than normal prayer, and the DVD introduces an array of meditators, from a number of religious persuasions, to tell viewers about this state of silence. From those who promote guided imagery (Katherine-Brown Sultzman) to those who promote interspirituality, the DVD should not be classified as Christian. Jesus Christ is rarely mentioned, nor is the gospel presented. What is presented is a deceptive collection of dangerous commentaries, and there should be a warning label on the cover - NSFA - Not Safe For Anyone. I think Richard Foster spelled it out clearly when in the DVD he said, ""The wonderful thing about contemplative prayer is that it can be found everywhere, anywhere, anytime for anyone."" In other words, you can practice this meditative tool and reach divinity, have peace and know God ... regardless of where you are with Jesus Christ. This very deep-rooted heresy called contemplative spirituality (i.e., spiritual formation) negates the Cross, demeans the sacrifice of Jesus, and nullifies the only way for man to be saved.",1145404800,72,1344,5.058558558558558
2500784,1,B000E6ES94,"With names such as Beth Moore, Charles Stanley (in the acknowledgements) and Max Lucado on the Be Still DVD, most people will automatically trust the content of this program. This means that tens of thousands of people will be introduced to Richard Foster's spirituality with a sense of security that what they are watching is biblically sound, relevant for their lives and accepted by those whom they have long trusted and looked up to.

If Foster's silence becomes the standard vehicle for going deeper with God, the Christian of the future, may soon resonate with Thomas Merton, who said: ""It is a glorious destiny to be a member of the human race, ... now I realize what we all are .... If only they [people] could all see themselves as they really are ... I suppose the big problem would be that we would fall down and worship each other ... At the center of our being is a point of nothingness which is untouched by sin and by illusions, a point of pure truth ... This little point ... is the pure glory of God in us. It is in everybody."" That is the crux of the controversy. If one takes the time to research the the spirituality behind this DVD, one will certainly find that the above observation by Merton is not just an anomaly but is the standard perception and outcome of contemplative spirituality. That is where the contemplative silence will lead those who follow it. It is the ultimate compromise of the Gospel and it simply cannot be ignored. This is one DVD that should not be watched.",1145404800,60,1503,4.525735294117647
2500785,1,B000E6ES94,"I tried to watch this DVD as if I were a person that knew little about contemplative prayer but had a fair knowledge of Scripture. By the advertisement, I am told that I'm going to be introduced to a new and different way to pray.  The video begins by telling me that we all live in a frenzied chaotic world and that Christians are not immune to it. It suggests that we need to spend more time in prayer. Gosh! What a revelation! I spent money to be told that?

The premise of the Be Still DVD is suggesting that we need to spend more time alone in solitude to read the Bible, but then the meaning is switched to now mean silencing, or stilling, one's thoughts. Which silent solitude do they mean? Finding quiet time or finding quiet time to quiet and still the mind?

The phrase contemplative prayer sounds like a suggestion that we are to contemplate God's word or contemplate its meaning by thinking. However, that is not its real meaning or how it is practiced.

Those on the DVD who promote the silence teach that this state of mind is reached through a repetitive practice (i.e., a mantra). Listed in the acknowledgements of Be Still is Brannon Manning. He describes the method in his book Signature of Jesus this way,

...the first step in faith is to stop thinking about God at the time of prayer.

The second step, ""without moving your lips, repeat the sacred word [or phrase] inwardly, slowly, and often.""

The third step concerns what to do when inevitable distractions come. The answer is to simply return to listening to your sacred word. Gently return your mind to your sacred word.

During this practice, contemplatives believe that you can hear God speaking in your mind. This is not a biblical practice. God has spoken to many individuals throughout the Bible but never by a meditative practice initiated by man. It is a dangerous practice and the results are detrimental.

Richard Foster admits to this danger in his book Prayer: Finding the Heart's True Home.

I also want to give a word of precaution. In the silent contemplation of God we are entering deeply into the spiritual realm, and there is such a thing as a supernatural guidance.... While the Bible does not give us a lot of information on that, there are various orders of spiritual beings, and some of them are definitely not in cooperation with God and his way! ... But for now I want to encourage you to learn and practice prayers of protection.

I need to protection to pray? For once I agree with Foster.

Their use of the title Be Still and Know That I Am God, demonstrates their lack of biblical knowledge.

There are two commands in this verse:

1. BE STILL (don't worry or panic) and

2. KNOW THAT I AM GOD (a recognition of God's sovereignty).

The Achilles heal of contemplative prayer has always been its lack of biblical support. The choice is clear, we either come to God on his terms or any way man sees fit. Coming to God through a practice taught by mystics during the Dark Ages which they borrowed from eastern religions is not coming to God on His terms.

I left the New Age to escape practices like these, because I knew they lead to deception.  I am not going to stand by and watch while my brothers and sisters in Christ fall into the same trap. The participants in this DVD are in scriptural error and must be confronted.  No matter how much these modern day mystics try to attain the silence they will never receive silence from me.",1145404800,102,3437,4.505636070853462
2500786,5,B000E6ES94,"There is too much noise everywhere in modern life, including modern religious life. TV preachers and direct mailers compete for who can shout the loudest to promote, condemn, convict and on occasion, preach a salvation message unrelated to politics. save. God says, ""Be still and know that I am God."" This excellent DVD serves as an important reminder that if we will keep quiet more than we talk, we might actually hear more of God's voice and less of our own. Wouldn't that be nice for a change?

I found BE STILL to be personally refreshing as a tool for my own Christain pilgrimage. I plan on using it for a group study following Easter. Finding quality,well produced, Biblically sound,resources is very rare. Especially ones that can be used in a wide variety of ministry dynamics. I consider BE STILL to be such a resource.

I have seen fad after fad so I am not easily impressed.this dvd moved me. I found myself saying to the screen yes ,yes finally some one in media has taken us to our histoical roots as lovers of GOD.Beth Moore ,Calvin Miller, Max Lucado and many others talk about how to grow in your love for CHRIST.I used this beautiful media presentation as a small group study .People were so encouraged to see people throughout the history of the church  longing for JESUS just like us.

2500789,5,B000E6ES94,I was one of the lucky people who had the chance to see this DVD before it was released.  It is a tremendous resource both to motivate your prayer experience and also to guide you in learning how to experience the great benefit of reflective prayer and bible reading.  The narration is beautiful and moving.  It does an incredible job of setting a mood and inviting the viewer to enter into the prayer experience. The men and women sharing their experiences is a veritable who's who of spiritual leadership.  I highly recommend this beautiful and moving resource for the spiritual journey.  It will not only move you to a deeper desire to pray - it will also teach you how to fulfill that desire.,1144108800,68,696,4.580645161290323

2500975,1,B000E6ES94,"I wad extremely disappointed to see the names of Christians whom I used to respect attached to this video. No matter what anyone else says, Contemplative Prayer opens you up to the spirit world. Richard Foster, who is in this video, has even said himself that it's possible for you to hear voices other than God's, and you have to discern which one is God's. That should be a huge red flag for anyone interested in this in this practice. We hear from God through His Word, not from some spiritual experience. If you can't hear God's voice in His Word then maybe you should check your relationship with God. Please don't mess up your spiritual life by getting involved in this practice.",1451174400,9,685,4.5772357723577235

2501314,1,B000E6ES94,"This dvd is a SUBTLE INTRODUCTION into eastern mysticism, basically, Hindu meditation. They do NOT tell people where they are taking them, but they LAY THE GROUNDWORK for the practice of Hindu meditation.  The phrase ""Be Still"" is herein intended to be an innocent sounding phrase derived from psalm 46:10. It is intended also to make viewers believe that what they are about to hear is from the Bible. This is not so!

The phrase ""Be Still,"" AS IT IS USED IN THIS DVD, is synonymous with Hindu meditation. Many call it contemplative meditation, or entering the silence.  The purpose of this meditation is to quiet the mind and to get in touch with one's higher power. This is done via repetition of a mantra or by lectio divina wherein one repetitively reads a portion of scripture WITH NO CONCERN FOR WHAT IT MEANS, OR WITH APPLICATION TO ONE'S LIFE, but with a concern to quiet their minds.  The higher powers that one encounters via the stillness or silence are not identifiable. These powers come and go as they choose. Hinduism Yoga, Wicca, Reiki and New Age Spirituality all use this form of meditation to encounter their higher powers. The Bible calls these powers ""familiar spirits"" and forbids contacting them. The book, A Time of Departing, explains this well. I encourage you to do an internet search and study this meditation to see if I am misinforming you.

Biblical meditation is the filling of the mind with the word of God with the intention of deeply understanding it and applying it. The intention of one who enters into the silence is to empty their mind so that they might encounter their higher power in that silence. They seek an encounter with their higher powers in order to receive illumination, or revelation from these powers. Practitioners believe that via these revelations they might eventually experience union with God.

The WORDS of the Bible are inspired by God the Holy Spirit. Therein, He reveals God to us.  If we did not have the content of scripture, then we would have no way of knowing God, or knowing how He wants to be worshiped. We cannot know about the spiritual realm via our senses. In Genesis ch 6 and 8 God speaks very disparagingly about the imaginations of the thoughts of man, how they are wicked continuously: should you trust your imagination to lead you to a nebulous higher power? Or should you trust the concrete words of a loving, living God?

In the dvd ""Wide is the Gate,"" (volume 1) the author of that work has done a great job of exposing these sorts of trends in the church. I loaned my copy of Wide is the Gate to a friend, afterwards, this person could also see that ""Be Still"" is designed to lead one into eastern meditation. Richard Foster and Dallas Willard are very well known Mystics who appear on the dvd Be Still with Beth. They do not come out and say that everyone ought to be a mystic (as I sarcastically stated in my title), they INVITE viewers to consider or to experiment with their prescribed way of worship.  Foster wrote a very popular book about spiritual disciplines that enable one to worship in the mystical way. I believe ""Wide is the Gate"" also critiques that work.

One of the tactics that Emergent Church leaders (the category that Foster and Willard fall into) use is the changing of word meanings. For example, the phrase ""contemplative meditation"" does not mean to ponder a concept deeply until you come to a more profound grasp of it. The meaning of that phrase is as I have stated above, the stilling of the mind to encounter one's higher power; in doing so, one is able to receive ""fresh"" insights, or revelation...from God. Emergents commonly state that the Bible is passe. They seek these fresh insights in order to find relevance. New meanings have been ascribed to many common Christian terms. It is up to you to ask for a definition of terms. Familiarity with the word of God will enable you to sense that something is wrong. If you are not familiar with the whole Bible, you are at a disadvantage.

I spent a couple  of decades lost in eastern religion; I was looking for truth that might help me worship God and understand the afterlife (moved in that direction by the death of my mother when I was 22).... I found that truth when I read through the Bible at age 53-54. I consider that accomplishment to be the greatest one of my life.

In the past 10 years of my Christian walk, I have discovered some very excellent preachers. I want to recommend some of them herein so that those who are abiding in God's word might be helped on their walk. John MacArthur, Alistair Begg, R.C. Sproul, Jim Andrews, and Irwin Lutzer, can be heard on Christian radio; Paul Washer, and Edward Donnelly, may be heard on Sermon Audio; Sermon Audio also airs the sermons of great preachers from the past such as C.H. Spurgeon--people read their sermons for us. The preachers I have mentioned are biblical. There are others and you will be able to recognize them if you are familiar with the entire contents of scripture and abide in it.

I also want to recommend free Bible software: e-Sword.net has a free download that provides about a dozen versions of the Bible, the KJV with Strongs concordance numbers; a half-dozen Bible dictionaries and about the same number Bible commentaries which includes Treasury of Scripture Knowledge which enables one to follow topics throughout scripture. One may add more Bible versions, dictionaries and commentaries to this system at a cost. But the free basic package is a great study tool for someone who wants to check Greek and Hebrew word meanings, and much more.

2501372,1,B000E6ES94,"In this part of the ""Be Still"" website ([...] it clearly states that ""BE STILL introduces a form of Christian contemplative prayer called ""Lectio Divina"" (which is Latin for ""sacred"" or ""divine"" reading).""  FYI, Lectio Divina ""is ordinarily confined to the slow perusal of sacred Scripture, both the Old and New Testaments; it is undertaken not with the intention of gaining information but of using the texts as an aide to contact the living God."" In addition, ""A person can linger over even a single word or phrase for an indefinite period of time after which one moves on to further slow and careful reflection."" Both statements from [...]

These are absolutely unbiblical statements and absolutely antibiblical prayer techniques.  The Bible is entirely True (Psalm 119:160), spiritual food for the true born again Christian (Hebrews 5:12-14), and necessary for Christian Sanctification (John 17:17).  To promote using the Bible for babbling mantras and gaining extrabiblical information is NOT what God intended it for.  Moreover, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16-17).

Finally the very title of the video is taken (out of context) from Psalm 46:10.  The Hebrew word for ""be still"" is ""raphah.""  In it's true context it literally means, ""stay put,"" or ""don't move hastly"" in reference to man's attempt to help God end wars in the earth.  The verse does not suggest an exercise for quieting the mind for fervent prayer or dialog with God.  Period.

Do not let the fools who appear in this video stumble your walk with the Lord.  Contemplative Prayer is unbiblical, unedifying, unsanctifying, and unnecessary.  Jesus himself said that the only ""stillness"" necessary for prayer is the kind you find in your room with the door shut (Matthew 6:6).

The practice of ""Contemplative Prayer"" is no different than the practices encouraged by Eastern Meditation gurus such as Baghwan Shree Rajneesh, Shirdi Sai Baba, and the creator of Transcendental Meditation himself, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. I strongly encourage you to research their individual ""philosophy"" for contacting the living God.

The information is simple but something we all need remember and practice: to slow down, come before the Lord, and really listen to him.

2501417,5,B000E6ES94,"I knew a film maker who died very suddenly and I remember thinking: ""What does a film maker leave behind?"" This thought was the seed that sprouted the movie: Beatific Vision.

I found myself thinking of a secret film that a character would leave behind when he dies. Not one he wished not to be found but one he planned to be found. More than a final will and testament this film was a ""Beatific Vision"", a view into the future of all characters and a clear mapping of the coincidences that would occur.

As I began to write the screenplay the voice of the Angel started to speak softly and occasionally. Upon many re-writes the Angel voice was vieing for main character status. I tried to reel in the angel but he (Angel Chad) wrestled control away from me.

When another close friend was passing to the other side, she added a strong dose of acceleration to the writing process. There now are so many Angels (most recently my Mother) involved, I feel I am at best the living hands to this project.

When I was a small boy my parents used to call me: Angel Michael when they wanted my behavior to change. I actually grew up thinking I was an angel including my sprouting scapula wings. Today, I do not think I am an angel but I surely believe that I am their vehicle for expression on earth.

After reading the 2 or 3 negative reviews here, I was curious and went back and watched it through again -- trying to discern if there was any truth to their opposing claims.  I do hear the heart of their message as a concern for people who might be led astray into new age, me-centered spirituality. I think we should all be aware that from from the beginning of time, even with Adam and Eve, it has been the intent of the enemy (the devil, Satan) to distort the things of God. The enemy seeks to lure us away from humility and repentance which can be found in TRUE contemplative prayer, or ""listening prayer"" as taught by this video.

Rather the devil endeavors **always** to slip us a cheap substitute -- i.e., meditations focused on SELF -- mindless chanting repetitions and mantras as found in secular new age teachings, guided imagery, etc.  Music as another example, was designed by God to stir men's souls toward God -- however the enemy is great at serving up cheap lyrics with good rhythm, which can ignite a more shallow feeling.  Another example is cheap sex, vs. true intimacy between a committed husband and wife. These are all just cheap substitutes offered by the devil in an effort to contort and distort the blessings God has reserved for His children. God built us all with this LONGING to connect with Him, listening to Him as He listens to us, communing with Him in holiness and purity. I believe the scriptural principles in this ""Be Still"" video are intended for those who are seeking a deeper communion with Christ and I personally find this message to be a very needed teaching for the modern day fast-paced church of 2007. This video is SO full of Bible scripture and full of God's Truth.  His sheep will know His voice ~~~ that is a guaranteed promise in the Bible, that true Christians will be able to discern the difference between the voice of the Enemy vs. the voice of the Good Shepherd. We can take Him at His Word that if we are truly seeking Him in a posture of humility, and surrendering our own wills (and cheap thrills!) to Christ, He will certainly direct our paths and guide us into all truth.

I can appreciate the negative reviewers' warnings to beware the cheap thrill served up on a silver platter -- it breaks my heart as well to see anyone led astray or deceived. Especially if it's me, LOL!  However since this video is now in wide circulation, it IS what it IS. Let's pray that God's Word in this video will not return void -- that His Word will bind up the brokenhearted and lead men into deeper relationships with Christ.

For those who long with all their hearts for more than a Sunday only kind of Christianity, but don't know how quite to start, this DVD has some wonderful guidance, that will spark the light within you.

Jesus is the core and substance of this documentary, and His Word the source. I fail to comprehend the Pharisaic mentality that would find the teaching in this DVD to be heretical, but as Quaker author Richard Foster says, ""It's much easier for people to debate the Bible than to submit to it."" All the teachers, pastors, and authors interviewed for this documentary have wisdom to impart, making this film a good investment of your time.

""Be Still"" is not only a good source for those seeking to learn on their own, but would also be an excellent tool for small study groups to use, and for pastors and Bible teachers as well. One of the 7 chapters of the DVD is on ""Small Groups,"" and gives ideas on how to use contemplative prayer in a gathering of believers.

WARNING: The DVD has a very peculiar set-up. My only complaint of this documentary is that it does not have a ""Play All"" option, and one must keep the remote close at hand. The 1st chapter is approximately 55 minutes long, and has a long list of credits after it, making one think that ""this is all there is,"" and stop the DVD. Wrong! There are about 40 minutes more in the subsequent 6 chapters.

1 Timothy 4:12-15
12Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.  13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.  14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.  15 MEDITATE upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.  16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.

8106646,5,B000E6ES94,"I was given this DVD by a counselor at church, who felt I needed to Be Still, and take time to grieve - and this DVD changed my life. It led to the season of quiet time I spent in prayer and ""listening"" contemplative prayer, which then resulted in my being led into ministry. I am now pursuing my Masters Degree in Counseling Ministries @ Denver Seminary to work in full-time ministry. I watched this DVD several times, and loaned it out - but didn't get it back. So, I'm buying it again on Amazon! I will also be presenting it to the residents in my workplace, where I serve as a Life Enrichment Coordinator in an Independent Living facility. I'm confident that it will inspire our resident's in their spiritual and prayer life, and walk with Christ. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD>",1489363200,,780,4.461538461538462
