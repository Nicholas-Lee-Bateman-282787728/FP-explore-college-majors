7531421,5,B017SQVOSA,"I just preordered this movie because my family saw it in the theater and it is a cut above most movies.  It is really the story of an African-American high school football player in the newly integrated South, and the powerful role that Christian faith played in the interpersonal relationships and larger social structures surrounding that explosive moment in time.  The goals and aspirations we desire for racial reconciliation and a just peace in society are not going to happen with fighting and denigrating each other.  This movie shows a better way, and,  being a true story, a realistic option for everyone who wants to have real prosperity in their family, community, sports team, business, etc.  The production quality and entertainment is second to none, and it will fill you with hope and joy.  A must see!",1450483200,129,817,4.927007299270073

7531522,5,B017SQVOSA,"Great family movie.  Shows how a school, its players, and coaches went thru integration in Birmingham, AL.  I am sure the media led you to believe that this never happened in the South, but this is a true story.  Woodlawn's coach, Tandy Geralds, was my roomate at Auburn University during my first quarter of school in the Fall of 1968.  He needed to do his practice teaching at Auburn High School to earn his degree.  Tandy was an All SEC baseball player, and I was surprised to later learn that he had become the head football coach at Woodlawn High School, the high school he attended.
Every thing shown in the movie is factual.  However, I cannot attest to the things that the movie showed about Coach Bryant as he recruited Tony Nathan.",1503792000,4,741,4.533834586466165

7531701,5,B017SQVOSA,"Incredible movie. Explains how character is forged and worlds are changed through faith and football. As a high school football player, I attended the Ray Perkins Football Camp at the University of Alabama and was very fortunate to spend a great deal of time with both Tony Nathan and Jeff Rutledge, who were in the NFL at that time. Both men were exceptionally giving, classy, and gracious to us. I never knew their prior connection until I saw this film, which is just BEAUTIFUL.God, I do love football!! Stories like ""Woodlawn"" are the reason why!

I coach now and took my son, who is white, and his best friend, who is black, to the movie. I love them both and am so fortunate to spend time with them both. Great boys!! Every fan of sports, in general, should see this movie. Even if you don't like football, this movie tells such a touching and relevant story about community leadership through faith in God. We are so fortunate that segregation was eradicated through the courage and discipline of great men!! I am very proud to share a home state with Tony Nathan, Jeff Rutledge, and Coach Tandy Gerelds.

7531746,2,B017SQVOSA,"I went to Woodlawn High School in the early 70's.  There is a good message here, but to dredge up police dogs and fire hoses, which occurred in the early 60's, is unnecessary to the essential theme of the movie.  There were no iron gates with chains and no yellow school buses either.  If you didn't have a car, which most of us didn't, students had to ride the city buses to arrive or leave school.  Not everyone got along, but hey, it was high school.

The movie maintained an underlying racial tension that I did not experience.  I NEVER heard the n word used and most students just went about their business of being a generally confused teenager.  If there was tension, it was about Vietnam.  The boys didn't want to get drafted, but some did and came back in pieces.

Tony Nathan was and is an amazing person, but don't bash Birmingham.  It is a great city and that only wants to get rid of the old stereotypes and move on to an even greater future.",1479254400,4,955,4.314606741573034

7531764,5,B017SQVOSA,"Excellent ! Loved this movie for some reasons maybe not everyone can appreciate.
But for me, I was there when this all happened. I was there when the Jesus movement happened.
 I was there when Billy Graham gave these messages.
 I was there, I was really young, but I was there when we pointed to the sky with our One Way.
and sang our songs like  Pass It On song
It only takes a spark to get a fire going
 And soon all those around, can warm up in glowing
 Thats how it is with Gods love
 Once youve experienced it, you spread His love to everyone
 You want to pass it on

What a wondrous time is spring, when all the trees are budding
 The birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming
 Thats how it is with Gods love
 Once youve experienced it, you want to sing
Its fresh like spring; you want to pass it on

I wish for you my friend, this happiness that Ive found
 You can depend on Him, it matters not where you're bound
 Ill shout it from the mountain top  PRAISE GOD
 I want the world to know; the Lord of love has come to me
 I want to pass it on

This movie is good. And for me it brought back all the memories of the Jesus People movement.
They say it is about every 30 years that the Holy Spirit really moves and revival happens.. We are over due..
I am waiting.. waiting to see Jesus again.

7531821,5,B017SQVOSA,"Sports and religion are a potent combination, one that siblings Jon and Andrew Erwin (October Baby, Mom's Night Out) exploit to canny effect in their new film based on the real-life Woodlawn High School football team that played in a history-making 1973 game that attracted 42,000 spectators (another 20,000 were turned away). With the recent wave of faith-based films making a real impact at the box-office, Woodlawn could prove a significant draw, at least in the red states.

Set in racially torn Birmingham, Alabama, the film begins with a prologue depicting the attempt by legendary University of Alabama football coach Bear Bryant (Jon Voight, strongly playing the iconic role) to ease tensions by inviting the integrated USC team to play in his still largely segregated city.

Cut to three years later, when the Woodlawn high school becomes integrated, with football coach Tandy Gerelds (Nic Bishop) welcoming the arrival of such talented black players as Tony Nathan (Caleb Castille, making an impressive screen debut). But the team still struggles to compete against their rivals at Banks High School, led by Coach Shorty White",1475020800,,1136,5.236263736263736

7531823,4,B017SQVOSA,"As a Christian I am always intrigued by Christian movies. As a movie buff I am usually somewhat disappointed as too many often fall into a ""preachy"" or ""corny"" category. I was pleasantly surprised as this movie came through as more authentic than most. It was well written and I believe well acted. The message was clear without being overbearing, preachy or corny. This is not a sports movie as much as it is a life movie. Maybe it helped that it was ""based"" on a true story. Whatever the case, this is the first movie in years I can strongly recommend.",1474848000,2,554,4.4411764705882355

7531855,2,B017SQVOSA,"You walk away from the movie feeling wondering what did you do with the past two hours. Minutes after watching the movie, it was forgotten- even to the point that I had to force myself to remember what it was about to give this review. The theology is American Christianity at its best. The Gospel  is the power of God to prove forgiveness to sinners- this is not the message given in the movie. In the movie, it makes people nicer, more accepting of each other, but there is never a call to repentance. This is the cheap grace that leads to the prosperity gospel that has plagued this nation. The directors want you to believe that the 'revival' that started at Woodlawn continues and has changed that city. History has shown that it remains as it was.",1473724800,,753,4.456521739130435

Black's and whites, unrest, the era, a football team, a little girl who wanted to see her daddy, the coach, win.... The movie was Remember the Titans. Woodlawn, the way it was played, was very hard to follow. I think it could've possibly been done better. The acting was decent, so that part was good.

Similar to Blind Side, yet with a faith component, which is probably why it is not on t.v. reruns like Michael Orr's story is (every other week). Like Blind Side, this is a TRUE story, that actually happened at Woodlawn High School in Birmingham, AL in the 1970's. Tony Nathan is a football STAR, who eventually played for the University of Alabama under Paul ""Bear"" Bryant. (Bear Bryant actually appears in this movie, in the form of John Voight.

Once again Hollywood has tried to hit the churchgoing market. But once again they have missed the target. Not understanding the true gospel message, they have turned this movie into a choose good versus evil movie. Which is NOT the true story of Woodlawn. Watered down, diluted and packaged in the attempt to sell tickets, Hollywood should learn from the Kendrick brothers and let real Christians make their movies.
I was in the Jesus movement. I was a college sophomore turned evangelist who left school to hold services twice a day and preached on streets and in parks for over a year of that revival. One the songs they played in the movie was, ""Jesus is just alright with me"" by the Doobie Brothers We would have NEVER listened to trash like that put out by a group named after a joint! The whole movement was to show that it didn't matter if Jesus was alright with us but if we were alright with Him.
We had GREAT rock music with clear themes of repentance, praise and redemption. Why weren't they used? Because blind Hollywood can't see or give the light. Still preachin' since 1966 as a high schooler.",1471737600,,1159,4.576923076923077

7532015,5,B017SQVOSA,Enjoyed this movie very much. One of the best movies I've watched in awhile. The cast was very good. What makes this movie so good is that it is based on a true story. Often stories that have a strong Christian message are fiction. I grew up in the 70's and 80's when there weren't messages of Christianity in my surroundings. I believe it is what has led to the world we are in today. Humanity needs a strong foundation of faith and by taking it out of the schools and all public institutions you eventually have what we have today. Less and less people are involved in religion or church. This movie is a good example of a young man with values and a gift and he used them both to become successful. The movie was somewhat about desegregation but that wasn't what it really was about. The messages in the movie are for everyone and great for children. Everyone should see this one. More family movies like need to be made.,1467244800,,924,4.3468208092485545

7532050,2,B017SQVOSA,"If you were after a religious recruitment DVD, you'd probably rate this higher after viewing it, but if you were after a movie that tackles racism in history, specifically in a period of history where those with dark skin were being blown up by explosive devices in the streets and the courts were forcing officials who were racist to the core to integrate student of all colours into their public schools. Then Woodlawn isn't the movie for you. I know the promotion blurb on the back of the DVD says that what the movie is about, but really that's just a weak back story, the movie revolves around a preacher played by Sean Astin who keeps hanging around the school locker room of boy's football team. He keeps bugging the coach to have a few minutes with the kids. Now this seemed completely implausible to me, that strange men can just hang out in schools, but then again, it was the 70's. Anyway one day the coach is feeling down and really can't face his players so gives in to the persistent preacher and tells him he can go talk to the kids for five minutes. An hour later he decides to go into the gym and is shocked to see the preacher still talking. His players are enthralled by the preachers speech, those who had formerly been racist towards dark skinned kids and wouldn't let them shower with them suddenly are best friends with their arms around them. Now this speech wasn't anything brilliant to somehow convert these kids. Even the best cult leader couldn't pull this off. At a later prayer group in the gym we even have a teacher go I was an atheist this morning but these kids, they've converted me. Seriously no effort is put into these speeches, we're just led to believe as soon as someone is told about God, they'll instantly want to become a part of the whole thing.

The former side of story of a racist father who wants his white kid who isn't a very good player to be given game time over a clearly much more talented than any other child on the field black kid, so he'll make a college team, barely raises its head again once the religious recruitment angle to the story kicks in, in full force. I was expecting this guy who when we first saw him had to be held back from punching a black woman to try and sabotage the team, ambush and assault the talented kid or the coach or do something. But really we glimpse him in the crowd giving the coach dirty looks but that's it. There's a brief scene where a brick with a note is thrown through the talented player's house window when his little brother is looking out at people lighting a cross on the front lawn but that's about the extent the racial tension is ever visited again. Well other than we see other dark skinned teammates just sitting on the sidelines in uniform and never play in the actual games. We're led to believe this team who was destined to maybe win two games that season became really good due to prayer (because that would be God's priority, making a high school team win games rather than stopping kids being murdered, enslaved, forced into prostitution and killed in wars going on at the time and stuff). Not to mention it was pretty obvious they started winning games because they had one kid who was really really good at football in the team and no one could tackle him.

When I read the back cover of this I thought, hey I remember this sort of thing happening on Picket Fences where black students were bused into Rome, and the police tried to stop them getting off the buses and the town was in fear of the crime they'd bring, with gangs stabbing their kids in the halls. So I thought this would be a lot more meatier, hardcore version of that type of thing, I really want to watch that! But no, instead it's a recruitment video for some prayer event, they even have an advertisement appear on the screen near the end with a phone number and telling you the viewer to come join us. They don't even bother trying to make it a subtle product placement or anything. It's a full on text voice over.

The fact this is a recruitment video should have been clearly labelled on the cover. Do these people seriously think people will buy this expecting a movie about racism and be converted or something and forgive the fact they've been conned by the misleading cover?",1466467200,,4267,4.426208651399491

7532074,5,B017SQVOSA,"I have to say that I loved this movie because I was in it, well sort of.  At the end when it showed the Friday night meeting in the Cotton Bowl in the summer of 1972, I was in that crowd.  I can say that I lived through this experience and the movie did a good job capturing the spirit of that week in Dallas under the auspices of Campus Crusade.  It was called Explo 72, and it touched thousands of people all across the nation and around the world.  There were 100,000 young people in the week long training in Dallas.  This movie traced the work of God through just one of those 100,000.  There could have been many more stories told of what came out of that huge Christian conference.  I've heard it's where Governor Mike Huckabee came to dedicate his life to Christ, and that story could be retold at least 100,000 times.  Quite an event for God in American and world history.  I still have the Life magazine issue that covered it so well, and quite a few clippings from the Dallas papers.  A great, life-changing event for so many.",1465948800,,1037,4.298969072164948

7532081,5,B017SQVOSA,"I've watched many sports...faith based...or true story type movies, but I've never had the pleasure of watching one with all of these themes.
This, to me, is one of the best movies I've ever seen. And not just for faith based movies...I'm referring to all movies.
Jon Voight's portrayal of Paul ""Bear"" is brilliant. You can't really define it as only a faith based movie, or a football movie...it's a movie that some would say is just to amazing to be a true story. But that's what makes it so special...because the story being is almost a direct account of what occurred at this high school between 1973-74!

The extra's in the blu-ray have most of the real life counterparts describing what it was like to see their lives being portrayed on the big screen. They all agreed that it was a very accurate depiction of their lives...and how this story unfolded.
I'm not going to tell you the plot, or spoil it in any way. I'd rather you be surprised in the way that I was.

If there was one movie I could recommend to everyone, this would be the one.
It's just that good!

The movie depicts the racism and hatred that was alive in the 1970's and used one football team to bring Jesus to the south. Only Jesus can save the world from their hatred, anger and more. The Jesus Movement of the 1970's was birthed out of this event and the movie does an amazing job describing it.

I was a little disappointed after hearing after many people brag about the movie. It was not as good as people hyped it up to be. I also wish these movies would get real ministers to play the pastor roles. The role of the preacher always seems so fake in many of these movies
 It's usually obvious when the person is not a real preacher. Other than that the acting was pretty decent . I just felt the movie was not that entertaining. I did appreciate the Christian Focus.",1463875200,,610,4.304347826086956

7532160,5,B017SQVOSA,"Solid well done film.  Has the look and feel of a big budget sports film which is way beyond most mainstream sports films. I am not a sports fan, but the filming of the game scenes were well done and showing the crowds is something that most movies have to avoid due to budget. This one doesn't use any trickery to hide there not really being an audience; it shows the entire stadium full of people, in aerial glory even.

The writing, pacing, cinematography, casting, acting and music are all very good.  The integration of archival historical footage with new footage adds a nice touch, giving the true story an extra degree of validity and power.

One message it really drives home is the impact and importance of the individual.  We need to help give others hope and one person can make a difference to another who makes a difference to another.  The ending footage of Billy Graham helps hit a home run message to share the good news with others.",1463270400,4,950,4.526315789473684

Our boys loved it, and we saw a few tears wiped here and there. If you are looking for a great family movie, with a powerful message of faith and hope, Woodlawn delivers. The story centers around an underdog football team, but also explores racism, domestic violence, comaraderie, sportsmanship and more.  There are very few movies we feel comfortable watching with our kids due to language, nudity, etc. With Woodlawn, we were able to relax and enjoy the movie without worrying about what our boys were going to see or having an itchy finger on the fast forward button.",1457136000,,691,4.710743801652892

I am a senior citizen and only one time was I absolutely angry that a wonderful, hard working black man didn't get the raise in position back in the 60's.  That was the only time had I had seen anything that was against a black man.  No signs for blacks only, nothing like that up here.

My husband remembered the trailer, and I am so glad he did! Not only is it inspirational, it's even historical as it tells the story about desegregation of Woodlawn High School in Birmingham, Alabama. It would be an excellent family film--especially for families with teenage or high school age children. (Families who enjoy football will also really appreciate this movie.) There is nothing inappropriate (except for the historical depiction of racial bigotry--which would make for great discussion.)  It's based on the true story of Tony Nathan, a gifted high school football player. All of team give their lives to Jesus Christ, and make a huge impact on the school and the community. As a boy mom, I am always looking for movies with strong men of good character to inspire my boys...and to see what it truly looks like to follow Christ.

The message of loving and forgiving one another as God has loved and forgiven us, can move mountains - especially today when the message is needed so badly.

There is not much out there that you can get without violence, nudity, curse words, and it's so refreshing to get a movie that is a good family movie to watch. And one especially with football in it. Being an Alabama fan made this an awesome movie and growing up loving Bear Bryant made this even better. I'm sure it's a movie we will be watching over and over again with friends and other family members. The story is just so good. Putting God front and center in your life is the single best thing you can do in your life and passing that on to others in the second best thing you can do. Share this movie with your friends.

The power of God to change hearts is evident in this movie.  Great acting, realistic storyline because - it's a true story.  Can't wait to read the book.

What happens when deep-seated, generations-old racial tensions collide with Jesus?  Softened hearts, forgiveness, resolve to do what's right, new friendships, laughter, family, true love.  That's what happens.  Racism, hatred - they don't stand a chance.

I challenge you to watch this movie - think about the change Jesus brought in Birmingham, Alabama in 1973, and consider Him.  He is real, He loves you, and He holds out his hand, ready to forgive you of your sins.",1455494400,3,775,4.9765625

I love love loved it. It took place in a time where racism was at its turning point. Change was difficult.

The lessons learnt were multifolded. Change is possible. In the midst of chaos, God makes all things possible. God speaks through His word and by other means - sports, if we allow Him to use us.

This was just amazing. I loved it I cried in so many places. And I appreciated it.
Thank you for creating this movie.",1455321600,,480,4.252747252747253
7532830,3,B017SQVOSA,"At times the film is inspiring, because revival occurs.  Revival is caused by God, leading people to turn to God as a group.
The acting is good.
Unfortunately, the story is not well told.  It drags at times.
When facts about the story are put on screen the print is really small.  The volume is not done well.  It regularly shifts from too
  loud to too soft.
Overall, I can't recommend the movie.",1455321600,,397,4.36986301369863

7532839,5,B017SQVOSA,"I graduated from WHS in 1966, before the time period of most of this movie. I moved to Birmingham from 'up north' (I was born in Brooklyn...) in time to start the tenth grade there in 1963. I remember the odd taunting of the first few 'integrating' black students - but there was no locked gate in the hallway and certainly not the racial animosity depicted in the movie. And - what kind of movie about Birmingham would be complete without the PD dogs and fire hose footage? Gee, that gets tiring. I wrote it off as 'artisticle freedom' - to help sell the movie. The rest of the movie was great - a success story of sorts. If Christian beliefs and behavior bother you - don't watch this movie. For that, ignoring the earlier remarks in evaluating the movie, it is well worth the 5 star rating.",1455062400,3,793,4.364864864864865

It is a good movie to watch for young adults and young people to learn just how bad racism was not too many years ago. It is also an encouraging movie of being strong in your faith of Jesus Christ.

I even raised my hand with a one finger skyward as the credits rolled. The effort of the Erwin brothers is worthy of elevating this faith based indie film to the mainstream market, and has the  capacity to compete with the best of the new releases.  Well acted; Jon Voight delivers an remarkably authentic Bear Bryant and Nicholas Bishop's portrayal of Tandy Gerelds is a genuine A list caliber performance.. C. Thomas Howell demonstrates a range of character acting not previously seen, and newcomer Caleb Castille plays Tony Nathan solidly with great physical accuracy.

Even if you are not a particularly religious person, you will enjoy this story -- based on a true one - that takes place in Birmingham in the awful early 70's when blacks and whites were at each other's throats.  Young Tony Nathan wants to play football and is supremely gifted, but until a series of unexpected events occur he probably will not get the chance.  This movie is right up there with ""Rocky""  in suspense and just plain good storytelling, with a dose of American history thrown in for good measure.  Sean Astin (""Rudy, Rudy!!!"")  inherited his mother's genius (he is superb) and Jon Voight -- well, when did young, handsome pretty boy Jon Voight become such a marvelous, mature actor?  It is such a pleasure to see a terrific movie without sex, violence, and filthy language.  I recommend this for everyone, but particularly for families with children to watch together -- and be reminded of the importance of family -- how critical it is for parents to tell their children that they are important and cherished.

A great reminder of what our country was like back in the early 70's, how horribly the African American youth were treated in that time, the power for change and good that youth have when they band together instead of fight one another, and how hate is never a good thing.",1454457600,,558,4.534653465346534

7532993,4,B017SQVOSA,"Released in 2015, Woodlawn is an inspirational sports film based on the true story of Tony Nathan, a running back who went on to play for the Miami Dolphins and played in two Super Bowls (XVII and XIX). The story focuses on his experiences at Woodlawn High School in 1973-1974 as Nathan and other black students desegregate the school under government mandate. Nic Bishop plays the coach, Sean Astin a motivational minister, Jon Voight Paul Bear Bryant, C. Thomas Howell a coach from a rival high school and Joy Brunson Tonys potential babe.

The plot and tone are very similar to 2000s Remember the Titans. Theyre also both based on true stories. The main difference is that Woodlawn is decidedly faith-based, albeit not as overt as movies like God is Not Dead (2014) and War Room (2015). The filmmakers are just telling the true story in which Christian faith was an essential part. If you cant stomach this element I suggest staying away.

In any case, the story moves briskly and theres a lot of football action.  The problem is that, like Remember the Titans, the film doesnt focus on character development. I suppose this is so because they're both based on true events and the writers didn't want to stray from reality. Whatever the reason, it prevents the story from truly captivating the viewer, but its worthwhile if you like inspirational sports flicks like Remember the Titans or movies that focus on the black experience in the South during the Civil Rights era, like 2011s The Help.

The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Birmingham and Hueytown, Alabama.

7533000,4,B017SQVOSA,"I truly enjoyed this film...it was moving...and will watch it again.  Production quality was very good...acting was excellent...story line was good, but the beginning of the movie required a leap of faith, no pun intended.  I would like to know how the spiritual leader, the guy (Preacher) who spoke to the team at the beginning, came to be at the school and in that position.  I would also like to have learned more about the white kid who first stood up when the Preacher asked who would join him.  That decision took guts...to be a teenager, in that racially angry atmosphere, and white...to be the first to stand.  But once past that spot in the film, I liked the way that ""love"" made such a difference.  This is a feel-good movie...so if you're in a not-so-good place and you want something to help lift you up...see this movie.

The idea of separating schools and 'religion' and well written and exposes how the 'powers that be' can not accept the idea of God, even when the evidence is clear and effective.

I saw it in theaters twice and just bought my own copy to show to all those who didn't see it when it was showing.  Bottom line: it tells the story of what can turn many around to a new life and affect a whole community when one man takes Jesus seriously and shares new life with them.  What encouragement to us all. The acting and side effects were well done as well.  I felt like I really saw Bear Bryant as he was. I highly recommend this movie!,1454112000,,525,4.058252427184466

And with that said, I watched the whole thing with all of the bonus features and I didn't start to squirm from sitting, fall asleep or go to the kitchen for snacks.  It was that good!  The story is so well told and sets up the tension in the 70's right at the beginning.  The filming of the plays on the field are the best I've seen in any movie.  I'm very glad that the Erwins made this very inspiring film to tell Woodlawn and Tony's story.  It is history and art.",1454025600,,494,4.041237113402062

7533129,5,B017SQVOSA,"I loved this movie.  Those were some tough, terrible times, but the way Christ was received and was allowed to show His glory and Love in these players at such a time in history was magnificent.  This is one I will watch again and again, like I do with my Kendrick Bros. movies.  It touched my heart, made me cry, made me shout out when he ran, and made me proud to be a human being.  I felt the fear, the pain, the violent times - I wanted to put myself inside the movie and stand in front of that house during that terrible scene and tell those thugs they will have to get through me first - a 5'1"" petite white woman!!  I will stand in front of any of my brothers and sisters in Christ any day.  John 15:13.

However, I have a big problem with the actress who portrayed Tony's mother - Sherri Shepherd. To me her presence in this movie discredited Tony's mom. This movie was about finding hope and Love in the midst of such horrible hatred and to cast an actress who went all the way to the supreme court to get out of the responsibility of  providing care for her own child - a child she wants nothing to do with...somehow she felt very out of place for me.  I was disappointed.  They surely could have found someone who brought glory to this beautiful story of God's Love and endurance.

No foul language, no sex scenes (except a lovely kiss or two), a hint of domestic violence, and of course the violence of the times, which is our history and therefore worth letting the children watch and learn from so it is never repeated by them.",1454025600,44,1541,4.225255972696246

7533133,5,B017SQVOSA,"Very uplifting movie. The story was fantastic as it told of football, friendship, spirituality, and diversity. If that wasn't enough, the backdrop was a very explosive time in this country's history. I hesitate to call it the Cicil Rights Movement because that actually took place earlier, at least the beginning. This was more racial unrest, racism, hatred,and just plain ignorance and cowardice. Everyone should see this movie whether or not they care anything about football.",1453939200,,478,5.386666666666667

7533137,5,B017SQVOSA,"The story of Woodlawn High School and the situation in Birmingham up to the early 70s is inspiring. Critics need to realize that this is a TRUE story. Acknowledging the power of God to change situations, along with receiving forgiveness by placing faith in Jesus Christ, really did happen, leading to the changes seen in the movie. I recommend that those who wish to debunk the value of God's involvement in the lives of people instead get on their knees and ask God to reveal Himself to them. Furthermore, we all need a savior because we have all sinned, and church is a place where broken people go to get healed (as the coach did), not where people who think they have it all together go to pat themselves on the back. As for the DVD version of the movie, I have mixed feelings about eliminating the shooting death of Tony Nathan's friend, which was in the theater version. On the one hand, it brings home part of the reality of the time, but on the other hand, without it the movie is more suitable to show to school age children.",1453939200,4,1034,4.4188481675392675

7533222,5,B017SQVOSA,"Having spent some of the summer in movie theaters, I got to see this film several times, and I have to say, it's truly a great film!  Based on a true story of a 1970's high school football team playing for a school that almost closed due to race riots and bombings, it is a story of redemption and revival. The story-line, screenplay, action and acting are all top notch, something not easily said about the majority of faith-based films.

If you are a sports enthusiast, you'll be enthralled with this true story of Tony Nathan, first black player at University of Alabama, who went on to play for the Dolphins. Couple that with the story of revival that broke out within the team in early '73 as part of the Jesus Movement that ended up transforming the city of Birmingham (formerly dubbed ""Bombingham"").

As a movie enthusiast who is a Christian, I'm very excited to see this film come about. It's a much needed breath of fresh air in a sea of mediocre films and it tells a great story that we need to know about. It's worth the money and time. You'll agree once you experience Woodlawn! And you might even begin praying for your town to see this kind of revival, just like Birmingham experienced through Woodlawn High in 1973-74!",1453420800,17,1233,4.520179372197309

Breath-taking cinematography, hard-hitting football, top-notch acting performances.  Five stars.",1452124800,25,424,5.609375
7533232,1,B017SQVOSA,"First of all, like Carolina Girl commented, ""Dude, did you not see the preview?""
So do this before you watch this movie because this is a religious-I-like-to-convert-you movie,
and has nothing to do with football or race.
And that is obvious since the movie starts and ends with the preachings of Billy Graham,
Yes it is based on a true story, but again it has nothing to do with football or race,
but really it is a mediocre movie about Jesus and religion (I have no
problem with faith, so I am talking entertainment here).
I guess they decided in Hollywood that the should something
else other than destruction Bible movies, and what better way
to approach people than football, and try to get them to join their
""revolution"" with a good story with a happy end (see the messages at
the end)
It was OK to watch, but I prefer Sean Astin as Rudy if we are talking
football.",1452038400,12,872,4.45625
