7804610,5,6300184811,"If you've followed Julian or know him best from interviews for Mr Jordan or Photograph Smile on You Tube it's hard to believe this is the same man at times. Followed as he rehurses for his first tour, and first performances in front of an audience, the prize of this tape isn't the music or the insightful interview but what happens on the down time.

Between concert footage where Julian is suffering from a stress cold and not quite knowing what his voice will do and an interview where he answers questions he hopes to never have to answer again are glimpses of the playful and compassionate man he will some day become. If you've seen the full interview from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pop-Me/dp/B000050B7T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pop & Me</a>&nbsp;and wonder what Julian meant by having just broken through some heavy emotional stuff it's here. He seems unable to laugh, unable to enjoy himself without feeling that he'll be ""told off"" for it. He fools around with his band mates, mentions how he liked the kind of humor in A Hard Day's Night and speaks affectionately about being friends with his band mates, some of whom he still works with. Julian also expresses a want to do good for the world but at the time was unsure how to best go about doing it.

As this is the only behind the scenes footage of Julian it's not to sit unwatched on the shelf of a Beatles collector but should be seen and hopefully shared.",1243900800,6,1471,4.903614457831325
7804611,5,6300184811,"This video provides a nice selection of footage of Julian Lennon in concert and offstage.  This video was filmed during Julian's first American tour.
  Besides singing, Julian also plays the piano in concert.  And in private he plays the drums.
  One of Julian's memorable performances was ""Day Tripper"".  His version is different from the original.  He gives a strong performance of ""Stand By Me"".  And the video ends with Julian singing ""Too Late for Goodbyes"".  This video shows that Julian had a good stage presence and was certainly a crowd pleaser.
  Excerpts from a sitdown interview are shown throughout this video.  Julian talks about the death of his father.  He mentions that he was in frequent contact with Maureen Starkey.  And he mentions a visit with George Harrison at Harrison's estate.
  This video also shows Julian in airports, hotels and backstage.  He  talks about the band members on tour.  And some of his fans are also shown and interviewed.

  In summary, this video shows Julian Lennon to be a talented person and a likable personality.",1041724800,8,1063,4.948571428571428
7804612,5,6300184811,"Great documentary on Julian. If your into his early stuff (which gets totally blown away by his latest album) then you'll totally dig this tape. The live stuff is great, but it'd be much better if it wasn't always being interrupted by interviews. If you find a copy and your a Julian fan, buy it. That was so obvious, duh.",1041638400,4,322,4.383333333333334
