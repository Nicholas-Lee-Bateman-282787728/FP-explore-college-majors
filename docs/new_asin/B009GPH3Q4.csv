5331361,1,B009GPH3Q4,"I wanted to watch this movie because Spike Lee usually creates worthy films, such as ""He Got Game"", ""Inside Man"", ""25th Hour"", ""Malcolm X"", ""Jungle Fever"", and the list can go on. However that being said, this movie was sub par, very slow, poor acting, and the story takes a radical turn that compelled me to turn the movie off before it ended.

One of the main characters, Da Good Bishop Enoch Rouse, is portrayed as a God fearing man, one left with the responsibility of taking care of his grandson for the summer. The Storyline had Da Good Bishop trying to instill religious values to his grandson, maybe overbearing, but a leader of the community and church. Then all of a sudden, a very radical change of events happens to Da Good Bishop Enoch Rouse while preaching a sermon in church. Without trying to spoil the plot for any readers, I just have to say what a ""Disgrace""... In real life we know this happens, but C'mon Spike Lee, you're in my opinion only aiding viewers of this film to further disrespect Church/Religion.

This was a poor film in every aspect. Hopefully the next ""Spike Lee Joint"" will be better.",1356220800,2,1121,4.5721393034825875

5331365,5,B009GPH3Q4,"Right now I am meditating upon Spike Lee's film ""Red Hook Summer.""  This film--preaches red, walks red, uncovers an evil church red ""rat"" that needs to be corrected by the community. The  implicit recognition that something is very wrong in the African American church experience is this film's thesis and its ""rat."" Mookie (Spike Lee), i.e., knows that; therefore, he will deliver pizza, but he will not attend ""Old Timers Day."" And it seems Spike Lee intends to right the wrong by telling and giving voice to an African American story that is often silenced by church members. Loving preachers can be flawed and one of their flaws may be molesting boys. The film calls for a right of the wrong that has been placed in a community. Oh it seems that the wrong is a poor community; it seems that the wrong is a vegan man-child who may not believe in God. In the inner sanctuary of the wrong, the wounded (as well as those who inflict the wounds) function. ""Red Hook Summer"" begs for a response. This is it:  There is a need for a healing altar in the African American church experience, especially as it relates to down-low preachers who molest children. This healing call is beautifully woven into the film by African American church music that moves, that flows through the film like spiritually imbued jazz. ""Red Hook Summer"" forces me to engage in an interior conversation with myself. How does a religious community heal when it is wounded by its church leaders? The healing is in discovery. A community discovers the real identity of its man of the cloth, its preacher man. A boy-child discovers his Grandfather has features of the devil he preaches about. That is the gift that  Spike Lee, the critical film-maker, has given to the genre of film--the repeated message that in the African American community there is beauty and evil at the same time. ""Red Hook Summer"" moves slow; it peals back the beauty and the ugly of the African American church experience one scene at a time. ""Red Hook Summer"" is not only an African American story; it is a human story about evil. It deserves a viewing!",1353542400,15,2098,4.677506775067751

5331379,4,B009GPH3Q4,"I seen this last night on Centric channel late night around 1:00 am! And it was a Spike Lee marathon of his movies especially this one!
This movie is called ""Red Hook Summer"" and it began with a boy name Flick a 13 year old visiting his Grandfather in Brooklyn New York to stay for the summer. During his time being in Brooklyn he has a hard time dealing with his heavy religious grandfather that believe God is everything! Working at the church he ran he met one of the craziest deacons in the church name Zee and a beautiful girl name Chazz! Flick and Chazz began to spend time together venturing off around Red Hook and shown Flick that they are alot of things he needed to know and learn! They began to create a wonderful friendship!

Red Hook projects are filled with gangs and people that are hopelessly hopeless and poor..For Flick and Chazz start to believe and understand alot more from each other and the place they dwell and from..Sort of like the ""Great Depression"" but in Spike Lee's version of the film.

All I can say is the acting was very good but could've been alittle better from the actor that played Flick! I felt like he wasn't that much in depth with the character or maybe his character wasn't suppose to have a personality idk smh. Just seemed like a very cold unhappy kid. The actress that played Chazz was very good and comical but wonderful! And she is a very beautiful girl with good acting skills for a amateur! The rest of the cast are good too as well! It was more like a ""Do The Right Thing II"" but just from a one person point of view and not views of the characters in the movie! I felt the movie could've have more to it like Flick and Chazz could've been more closer! I was hoping in the ending one of them could've gave one a kiss on the cheek or something cause I felt love between them though they are great friends throughout the whole movie!

The ending was a bit confusing cause even though the Grandfather was living foul most of his life molesting boys him and Flick decided to leave Red Hook since people know his dirty past including his Grandson. I felt that it should've been alittle different in the ending instead of the being a bit bittersweet ending. Cause Chazz can never see Flick again..So I thought that was sad cause I could see them two youngsters being together..

But this movie was more than about religions and churches it was about the unperfect itself in people and everybody! You gotta give Spike Lee some props for trying his best shot at another Brooklyn Tale Film c'mon! I give it a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars! I know Lee ain't like how he used to be but ya'll have to understand everybody get's older and can't do it like they used to..BUT THEY NEVER FORGET HOW TO DO IT! And what he did do was make incredible movies! This movie ain't BAD, it's good and not awful either! You'll have to give it a chance and experience yourself watching this good film! It's alittle weird with hurtful truth but that what makes Lee's film's creative!",1410134400,,2998,4.367383512544803

5331383,2,B009GPH3Q4,"....and I'm very glad I only paid $6.78 for the dvd.  I bought it because it takes place ""on location"" (right across the river from where I live), plus I'm a big fan of Clarke Peters after his wonderful performance in ""The Wire"".  However, we had to force ourselves to slog through this.  Peters certainly gave a good performance, but the actors portraying Flick & Chazz were quite wooden (the latter most of all).  With so many talented young actors - including right here in the NYC area - I'm incredulous that they're the best the producers/etc. could come up with.

There were also various story lines that weren't credible - and in the end, I feel the responsibility totally rests with Spike Lee.  I liked a few of his earlier films, but subsequently he became too ""full"" of himself - and his over-the-top comments in recent years have really turned me off, plus I think his arrogance has carried over to his films.

Don't waste your money and/or your time watching this film; it's just not worth it.",1395619200,2,1005,4.581005586592179

5331396,5,B009GPH3Q4,"An underrated Spike Lee gem, which had a very limited release late in Summer 2012.  This is one worth checking out.  The acting of Clarke Peters really stands out in the lead role.  Even Spike himself recreates one of his most memorable movies role, that of Mookie from Do The Right Thing, who continues to deliver pizza for Sal's Famous Pizzeria in Brooklyn.  Also back from an earlier Spike Lee joint:  Tracy Camilla Johns, who reprises her earlier role as Nola Darling, the female protagonist from She's Gotta Have it, albeit in a quite different way here.",1381017600,3,559,4.721649484536083
5331397,5,B009GPH3Q4,Realism at its best.  I liked the characters. The young boy in the film was very good.  A very real situation depicted in the movie. Go Mookie!!,1375401600,4,144,4.296296296296297
5331398,3,B009GPH3Q4,"This is an epilogue to Do The Right Thing, a movie many people consider Spike Lee's magnum opus, only in the sense that he uses it to reprise his role as Mookie. It's a brief cameo feature but a touch of nostalgia nonetheless. Both movies focus on black people in the city of Brooklyn. I just happen to like this one a little more.

The acting on the part of the two child stars is surprisingly amateurish, especially the girl's; her voice inflections are consistently wrong; but Red Hook Summer, as desultory as its plot may be, is never boring. That has mostly to do with the boy's grandfather, a Bible-gripping bishop who preaches the gospel even when he's not preaching.

He's determined to introduce his grandson to ""God"". And even if his cultic sermons fall on deaf ears, the church song performances he leads are enjoyable. The non-diegetic music, which plays even during scenes it shouldn't play during; Spike Lee appears at the end wearing a ""No Music"" shirt, oddly enough; sounds good too.

There's a major plot twist in this movie; a sudden character reveal near the level of the one in The Sixth Sense. The way it happens is, like the riot scene in Do The Right Thing, overdramatic and even a bit silly, but it sets the tone for an ending that, whether you feel compassionate for the protagonist or not, is somber and moving.

5331400,4,B009GPH3Q4,"Spike Lee and Woody Allen are the only film makers that come to my mind who are in love with the cities that they live in. Their movies are not just about the characters but also about the city - mostly New York and its vibrancy. While Allen has recently flirted with Europe, Lee remains a faithful New Yorker and returns to his Brooklyn roots with Red Hook Summer.
Red Hook Summer abounds with  characters, their observations through dialogues, often include monologues which help Spike Lee create a very watchable film but with limitations.

Flik (Jules Brown) is  a 13 year old teenager whose mother, Colleen (De'Adre Aziza), brings him from Atlanta to New York to spend a summer with Bishop Enoch (Clarke Peters), the grandfather with whom both Flik and his mother are estranged from.
Enoch is a hardcore Baptist preacher who runs a little church facing financial trouble known as Lil' Piece of heaven and is hellbent on teaching Flik the importance of God- Jesus. Flik reluctantly tags his grandfather everywhere that he goes, with his Ipad and finds fascinations in the rants of alcoholic stock market proponent Deacon Zee ( Thomas Jefferson Byrd) - funny character. and make friends with a loud mouth yet lively Chazz ( Toni Lysaith)
Flik is in the projects and he wonders about their differences and these many characters are what make Red Hook watchable. Most of the scenes are shot in the church where Pastor Enoch waxes  and rants eloquently  about gentrification, education and the worsening state of popular culture. Towards the end, there is a startling revelation but somehow is not impactful
Spike Lee makes a brief appearance as Mookie, the pizza delivery man as he played in Do the Right Thing.
This is not Lee's greatest movie but as always his observations about society and life are fascinating and entertaining. four stars. 05/11/2013",1368662400,3,1856,4.898089171974522
5331401,4,B009GPH3Q4,"This one took me off guard, I think Spike is a genius. I felt my timing in watching this movie was off, if I were to have watched it when all of the accusations were made against Bishop Eddie Long then I think it would have moved me even more. At first I thought it was bizarre and out of nowhere, however, when a issue like this reveals itself then it is just like that; out of no where. No one can believe it and it becomes a total shocker/upset. The ""new"" truth is revealed. This movie shocked me but also made me replay what happened and understand the issues clearer and realize what just took place really happens.",1365120000,,620,4.218487394957983
5331402,5,B009GPH3Q4,"I bought this movie without seeing it first. I received a gift card to a certain store for Christmas, and with tax it was slightly over $10.00.
  The movie centers around a young man who calls himself Flik Royale, who is from upper middle class Atlanta and goes to the Red Hook housing project in Brooklyn to spend the summer with his granfather, Bishop Enoch Rouse whom he has never met before.
 The movie is filled with many colorful characters. Spike Lee revises his character Mookie, visibly older and still delivering Sal's Pizza, from the movie ""Do The Right Thing"". We see Mookie twice. There is Chazz Morningstarr a young lady who befriends Flik, and teaches him a thing or two about life. Deacon Zee, a deacon in the church,who is a wino, talks about the economy uses profanity constantly. He is the most comical character, other than T.K., the church organist.
  I love the way Spike uses vibrant colors in the movie mostly, reds, purple's, yellow, greens, and blues. The soundtrack is also a standout. Judith Hill , who was one of Michael Jackson's backup singers, has several wonderful tracks. Bruce Hornsby has a few tracks also.
  The movie has a complete plot twist. I won't reveal it, but as in the past, many of Spike's film deal with things that are going on in the black community, and sometimes other communities as well.
 I thought this was a great film, I have been a Spike Lee fan since 1988. I think many people slept on this film, but Spike is as brilliant as he was 25 years ago. All of his films have a message!  We can all  come away with something from his films.",1362182400,,1592,4.515679442508711

5331405,3,B009GPH3Q4,"Red Hook Summer had a great storyline. You can alway count on Spike Lee to create a movie to initiate conversation. Although the movie had interesting moments, it could have developed more of a relationship with the pastor and his daughter. I am a dedicated Spike Lee fan, but would have loved to see him dig a little deeper to push this movie further.",1359417600,,352,4.515625
5331426,4,B009GPH3Q4,"Spike Lee as a Director is once in a lifetime good.  He can figure out ways to make so many unacceptable things work on film I stand by that to my grave.  Hitchcock could do that.  And Fritz Lang.  And Sergio Leone.  And Kurosawa.  I'm officially out of comparable superlatives.

Spike at his best has ALWAYS represented the alienated and disenfranchised young outcasts of society as the most undervalued wonderful human beings in every single movie of his that I've seen.  And for all of Red Hook Summer's flaws, he's still getting that done.

Nothing fancy here.  A whole LOT of Christian bashing & offensively bad behavior from white Condo owning invaders are really the action highlights.  There's no hit pop singles to be found either.  Just really interesting character development in Brooklyn as it goes through awkward gentrification.

The generation gap is so well documented here it's a Spike Lee movie for grandma to say, ""SEE kid!  I KNOW your frustrations!""  And that ain't bad at all.",1359072000,,998,4.857142857142857
5331427,5,B009GPH3Q4,"This was one of those films that went under the radar.  I finally got around to seeing it just now and on the small budget he had, this was a very fine film!  When the pre-hype for the film started, I said to myself ""this is not the Spike Lee Joint I was expecting!""  However, after seeing the film, it was nicely done, shot in digital HD which in this case, helps with the film's aesthetics.

This film tackles many African-Americans unwavering belief in the Christianity forced on them during slavery and how many give up hope, work or struggle for their 'trust in god.'  It also explore the hypocrisy in the Christian church such as lying, eating pork and child molestation.  All were properly explored and nothing was overdone.  You also have your trials and tribulations of living in the hood as well.

This film seems award worthy as it is a dialog driven film.  For those who say that this is boring, it held my attention from start to finish.  This is coming from someone who fell asleep while watching ""Quantum of Solace"" in theaters and does off watching ""Skyfall!""  This one goes along side ""She Hate Me"" as a Spike Lee film that many are not aware of, but are Spike Lee masterpieces!  Spike Lee need to make MORE films - at least two a year and he needs to do it like Tyler Perry (I know Lee does quality over quantity) and come with one he wants to tell, like Red Hook Summer, and balance it out with a money maker like ""Inside Man.""  Some of us want to see MORE Spike Lee Joints!  He should make a film about the Moors in Spain too!  I'd like to see if Hollywood would let him do that!",1358553600,,1599,4.283333333333333
5331428,1,B009GPH3Q4,I found this movie profoundly boring and just overall uninvolving with terrible acting from the two kid leads. Big fan of Spike so this was a hard letdown. I can't even fathom ever watching this again. It's not worth it.,1358294400,3,220,4.525
5331429,2,B009GPH3Q4,"I remember a day when a Spike Lee movie would come out and critics would fall all over themselves to talk about what a genius he was. I would see these same movies and think they were well made and interesting but nothing near as special as they seemed to think they were. Then things began to change. Lee's new movies weren't getting near the attention his earlier works did and he became known more for his outrageous comments than his films. If he continues to make movies like this I can see that continuing.

REDHOOK SUMMER takes place in the now familiar Lee territory of Redhook, Brooklyn. Young Flick is forced by his mother to arrive in Redhook to spend the summer with his religious grandfather Enoch, a pastor of a church there. Coming from a middle class home where he has his own food and non-stop use of his Ipad 2, Flick grumbles about wanting to go home and hates the situation he's in.

Enoch doesn't cow tow to the boy and makes the food he normally does. He also has Flick work for him in the church, taking care of the building and handing out pamphlets. It is at the church that Flick makes his only new friend, a young girl named Chazz who takes no guff from Flick and who speaks her mind frequently.

Flick seems like the most naive character on the face of the Earth. Walking around the tough neighborhood of Brooklyn he flaunts his Ipad constantly never fearing that it will be stolen from him. When he meets the gang on the street, The Bloods, he doesn't flinch or act like he might be in any jeopardy while his grandfather gives them their space. He might try to convince them to change their ways and accept God but he knows better than to push their buttons.

The story here is incredibly thin, that of a young boy discovering a different world than he's used to. While he's surrounded by faith and all that comes with it, the movie isn't about faith or discovering it. Instead it's about Flick and how he changes based on what goes on around him. Plenty of screen time involves the church and sermons there, but Flick seems unfazed by all that. He's more affected by his friendship with Chazz and the experience of being around his grandfather that the time in church. All that changes towards the end of the film with a startling revelation.

Two things harm this movie more than anything. The first is the acting involved. Both the actors portraying Flick and Chazz are the most amateurish I've seen in some time. There is no life in Flick, no spark that this is a real person. Instead I felt like I was watching someone read a book instead of acting. The actress playing Chazz felt more like someone portraying a caricature than a real person. Maybe having never been to Brooklyn I'm missing something here but I don't think that's the case.

The second worst thing this film does is be boring. The pacing is incredibly slow. Slow patches suddenly have speeches from characters inserted before going back to slow patches. There are few if any characters to sympathize with. With the exception of the big reveal towards the end of the film you feel like nothing is happening here.

Movies have been made about the coming of age for characters since the black and white films of the past. Those movies involved the viewer, made them want to know what happened to the character after the final credits. With this film I couldn't find myself caring what happened to the character while it was going on. This is one movie I couldn't recommend to anyone with the exception of Spike Lee followers who will find any movie he does a work of art.",1357776000,9,3569,4.489984591679507
5331430,5,B009GPH3Q4,"I've been Addicted to this Film and watched it roughly 4x's over the last few weeks...Bishop Enoch's character is complex and compelling-- from the hair, to the bow legged walk, to his Old School, Southern Christian Charm..Brilliant Acting

This movie was done in 12 days, Independent Style; it is Raw and in your face which gives it an organic, funky look...people may instantly connect to the characters... especially if you grew up in the Projects or spent time with Relatives who did. The mixed reviews, I believe, is from die hard church folks who thought this was a Gospel film...there's some Singing and Preaching, but not entirely. People have different reasons for going to church..I believe for the most part, Church IS used like a drug/opiate.. a movie like this will ""spoils that high""...Die Hard Church people, caught up in that culture, will likely take issue with this Movie.

However, there are people who go to these places with pure hearts and intentions..and I feel their Families shouldn't be Victimized or hurt in the process of finding a spiritual home...The Acting in RED HOOK SUMMER is Superb and this film is one of the few that brings awareness to those who may not be; it serves a divine purpose for us all.",1357344000,,1234,4.816037735849057

The acting was not good, it seemed very low budget, it was extremely hard to watch and follow what was going on. It was the kind of movie that just makes you say ""huh?"" the whole time.

It's the end of 2012 and at the 18 minute mark the older guy is screaming the n word about buying GM stock because of the bailout and I don't understand where we are with that word anymore?

In this film he exposes religion (especially born-again Christianity,) for what it really is- a destructive and hypocratic form of judging people when we all are guilty and at the same time we are all equal. The acting is superb. Clarke Peters in the main character of the bishop is amazing and should be given an Oscar nod, but of course he won't. In fact, more than likely this film will go largely unnoticed by the film community at large because of it's subject matter. Give the studio  a film like Inside Man or 25th Hour and it will make millions but oh no, not a film about real life and real issues that plague our world, don't do that!",1356307200,3,775,4.381944444444445

8541336,4,B009GPH3Q4,"I have just finished watching this movie Red Hook Summer.

The story of a young teenager sent to spend the summer with an unknown grandfather whom we learn is a pastor at a small church in Red Hook Brooklyn, shows the viewers there is more to this area's characters than we (along with the characters!) see from day to day basis. This should clue you into what is hidden, you never know what someone is hiding or running from and why! The various characters (along with several cameos: Mookie, Nola Darling, the Deacon who is Chazz's uncle, a couple of church attendees, the cop) provide a sense of what and how this community lives. Some are seen as ""saviors"" and others are seen as lost or the ""devil"" has a hold on them. At the end, you really get to find out never judge a book by its cover!

I like the atmosphere of Red Hook Summer because it brings me back to my childhood of watching movie Crooklyn. There is even a gesture that Chazz does which is copied from a character from that movie, this brought a smile to my face. The acting is reminiscent of Crooklyn, some actors and actresses (especially the children and a few adults) could work on their skills BUT why? That is what brings in the authentic feel of bringing the movie to life. And the other actresses and actors with their great acting showcase their talents which bringing together both I feel allows a sense of real community for these characters in this fictitious story.

My overall view of the movie is no one is ever who they claim to be, their past involves secrets along with forgiveness of sorts. I definitely love how the ending occurred because I can see the two children growing up and possibly a future movie will feature them. My rating is out of ten stars, I give seven.",1431820800,2,1756,4.447204968944099
