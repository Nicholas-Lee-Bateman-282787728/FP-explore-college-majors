4084546,2,B0038FH70A,"... and I really enjoyed ""The Sun Also Rises"". This film is scripted as though the writer ate a heavy dinner and fell asleep while reading Hemmingway, with the resulting nightmares being this film. The story is about a group of four pilots released by the service at the end of World War I that, instead of going home, hang around in Europe drinking heavily and wasting their time with a woman even more annoying than the overall experience of watching this movie - Nikki (Helen Chandler). Ms. Chandler seems to be doing a bad imitation of Billie Burke here. While Ms. Burke was always interesting and whimsical in her roles, Nikki is just a simple and rather flippant ditz whose act gets old in a hurry.

Just knowing the background of the film I know where this story is trying to go, but there is no context to let you know these guys are numbing themselves to forget the war and anything that might matter. Instead, you are left with man-child behavior and dialogue that would make Judd Apatow blush. Only at the end is there any attempt to tie everything together in a touching scene between ex-pilot Cary (Richard Barthelmess) and Nikki. My recommendation is to steer clear of this one.

The video and audio on this 1931 film are in excellent shape. There are no extra features on this DVD-R release, and there are no chapter stops. You may only go forwards and backwards in ten minute increments.",1271462400,3,1403,4.585657370517929

8391271,3,B0038FH70A,"This poor man's THE SUN ALSO RISES is a fascinating mess. Combining a moving, almost unique Lost Generation alcoholic haze with awful direction by an exemplary director -- it leaves you scratching your head. Helen Chandler's ""performance,"" if it can even be called a performance, is so indescribably awful the viewer doesn't know where to assign blame: dope, the producer, director? Supposedly Chandler was a stage actress. In THE LAST FLIGHT she's so somnambulist and lifeless it makes her thematically stuporous performance in DRACULA resemble Betty Hutton at her hyperactive best/worst. She kills this movie, character motivations, not to mention several hapless drunken Lost Generationites -- yet remains retardedly oblivious. Coma victims are more expressive. Ineptitude that can, finally, only be admired. She's in a different movie, or casting couch screen test. Johnny Mack Brown's usual scene-gobbling is wearisome but he has a good death scene. David Manners' tic-less war tic is also something the director seems to have forgotten. Certainly Manners does. This isn't the Deiterle of later renown. A fascinating period document but mediocre movie.",1406851200,,1157,5.5423728813559325

8391273,4,B0038FH70A,"Democrats tend toward evil.  Kennedy got America into Viet Nam, Truman got American in Korea.  My grandfather, as poor a farmer as any (who farmed just so his family could eat what he produced and not starve during Roosevelt's depression) hated FDR for getting American into another European conflict.  America was always put into wars by self-styled progressives. And they are also the only people in world history to use the atomic bomb against people.

One of the earliest presidents who styled himself a ""progressive"" (since the Democrats' Al Goresque William Jennings Bryan was defeated three times) was Woodrow Wilson, a snooty, donnish type who thought he knew better than anyone else (as this review is written in 2013, you can draw your own parallels).  William Jennings Bryan was his Secretary of State -- but, to Bryan's credit, he resigned with Wilson broke a campaign promise and embroiled America unnecessarily in the European war of 1914-1918.

Very little good can be said about America's involvement in World War I, except that lots of good literature came from the ""lost generation"" that followed it.  F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dos Passos and others came from that period.  Hemingway was particularly incisive with his novel THE SUN ALSO RISES.

Almost a carbon copy of THE SUN ALSO RISES was John Monk Saunders' THE SINGLE LADY.  It was about bored and damaged people partying to forget their meaningless lives.  And since John Monk Saunders had an entree to Hollywood (he won the Oscar for writing ""The Dawn Patrol"") he was able to get his novel on screen as ""The Last Flight.""

""The Last Flight"" is about four men and a woman boozing through Paris and down to the bullfights in Lisbon (sounds a lot like Hemingway's book, huh?) and it has little more story than that.  The men. John Mack Brown, later a western star given a sort of immortality in a Statler Brothers song.  David Manners might be recognizable to those who are into obscure horror flicks. Richard Barthelmess was a silent movie actor who had been in ""The Dawn Patrol"" and continued on into talkies until the '40s.  Barthelmess' character is named ""Cary"" and that character name is alleged to be where Archie Leach got the idea to change his name to Cary . . . Grant.  The woman, Helen Chandler, is most famous for being pursued by Bela Lugosi's ""Dracula.""

So-called ""silent movies"" had developed into a high art.  They were smooth and capable.  When the talkie era started, the movies had to learn their art all over again, using clunky microphones and actors who could speak rather than merely emote.  Made in the first years of the talkie era, ""The Last Flight"" suffers from the crudity of these early days.  The dialogue, instead of flowing, is punctuated by unnatural pauses.  Despite winning an Oscar, John Monk Saunders' dialogue is stilted.  The girl's dialogue is meant to be flippant but it comes off in a series of nutty-sounding non sequiturs, including the justly famous, ""I'll take vanilla.""

If you can take the early-talkie crudity of the production, or if you have an historical view of flim, it's worth giving this picture a try.  Otherwise, despite an attempt at an exciting ending, you might want to give it a pass.",1370217600,,3227,4.844890510948905

I've never seen anything else like it - this movie is for the sophisticated viewer who knows how to appreciate an odd, lovely gem like this.",1356307200,7,282,4.185185185185185
8391276,3,B0038FH70A,"I can understand why people think highly of this movie.  It attempts to do something laudable, which is to dramatize the lives of men who were damaged and broken by the combat of World War I.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, it fails to actually do that.  If you know what it is trying to do, and already know from personal experience the effect that war can have on men, it may be quite moving; but to me it fails to show that the characters in it are those kind of men, or to show what they are going through.  The viewer must make all the effort; the story, dialogue, actors, and direction are very little help.

The movie starts with intense shots of WWI combat, soon focusing on an American military pilot (Cary Lockwood, played by Richard Barthlemess) and his observer/rear-gunner (Shep, played by David Manners).  They narrowly escape a flaming death.  Shep is badly wounded, and Cary has to hold his hands in fire to bring the plane down more or less safely.  We then see them being discharged from a hospital in France after Armistice Day.  Cary's hands are still bandaged, and Shep wears dark glasses to hide his eyes.  Finally, they are quickly shown to know another pair of wounded Americans, Bill (Johnny Mack Brown) and Francis (Eliott Nugent).

The bulk of the movie is set in Paris in 1919, as the four men drink, carouse, and meet an eccentric young American woman, Nikki (Helen Chandler), whom they befriend and who takes a particular interest in Cary.  A fifth man, Frink (played by Walter Byron), hangs around them (particularly after Nikki shows up) but is tolerated rather than liked.

The climax and conclusion of the movie is set in Lisbon.  Cary tries to go there alone to avoid his growing feelings for Nikki, but is followed by the others, including Frink.  There a number of the men's stories are wound up, leaving only Cary and Nikki together at the end.

The problem with the film is that while we are told that these men (except Frink) have been damaged physically and burned out mentally by the war, we are shown nothing of the sort.  We are told, for instance, that Cary's hands are crippled by burns.  Yet except for a couple of shots when he is shown using two hands to pick up a glass, his hands look perfectly normal, and he uses them for all everyday purposes without apparent pain or effort.  He does not wear gloves to hide them, he is able to use his fists effectively, and in the last scene of the picture, he is shown writing a letter longhand with an ordinary pen!  Shep is supposed to be wearing his dark glasses to hide a facial tic that only liquor can soothe - but we *never* see it, not even once.  Bill is shown to be strong enough to wrestle a horse to the pavement!

Similarly, although these men are meant to be suffering from what we would now call Post-Traumatic-Stress Disorder (PTSD), little or nothing about the characters suggest that.  They just seem like somewhat elderly (Barthlemess was about 35 at the time, and Manners was about 30) college students on what would now be a fairly sedate and high-class drinking vacation.  (Pretty much all of their drinking is done in the rooms and bars of expensive-looking hotels.)  Cary (Barthlemess) does look rather grim and unhappy - but he looks that way all the time; drinking seems to bring him no relief, so one wonders why he does it.

Shep (Manners) and Bill (Brown) convey no sense of pain at all; only Francis (Nugent), who is given the least screen time of the four, seems in any way disturbed.  He has a chiming watch which seems to bother him; when it rings, he gets up and begins to leave whatever room he is in, although he apparently has no idea of where he is going.  One time it is on a train, and he has to be stopped by his friends.  This is really the only sign of mental upset we are shown, and it is not enough to convince us (OK, me) that these men have been broken by the war and cannot tolerate life sober.

This brings us to Nikki, the young woman who befriends the group.  She is a strange character, but one who is now recognizably a stereotype: the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, about whom much was written after the recent success of the Zooey Deschanel sitcom ""New Girl"".  (To the credit of the character and the actress who plays her, Helen Chandler, Nikki is not manic, but rather quiet and subdued.)

As this suggests, Nikki is a fictional construct rather than a character; she is an accepting, unquestioning, child-like playmate, rather than a normal person who might either judge them or join enthusiastically in their partying.  She is so child-like in fact, as to make one (OK, me) wonder if she is not ""touched in the head"", and how she could be safely left alone in a big city like Paris in 1919, which must have been a center for the world's con-men and seducers.  But she is just what the men, and especially Cary, need in order to heal.

Her child-like nature is such, in fact, that none of the men take any interest in her sexually - except Frink (Walter Byron), who is more or less the villain of the piece, and who is explicitly not a damaged veteran like the others.  One would think that men who are supposed to be carousing non-stop to forget the trauma of war would be carousing sexually as well, but Nikki, although attractive, is pretty much a ""legless angel.""

What all of this adds up to is that the movie has an exciting beginning, an eventful conclusion - and a middle section filled with a lot of dull talk from characters who have done nothing to earn our sympathy.  (None of the actors, except perhaps Helen Chandler, has enough screen presence to hold our interest on their own.  Barthlemess, in particular reminds me of George Raft more than anyone else.)  We are told what we ought to feel for these characters, but unfortunately the movie does little or nothing to make us feel that way.  Even Nikki, who starts out charming, begins to seem tedious and simple-minded with nothing to do but talk.

An episode from the movie may define the problem with it best:  Nikki follows Cary to the famous Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, where he goes regularly to visit the grave of Heloise and Abelard, epically doomed medieval lovers.  He tells her their story, and it seems to mean much to both of them.  The story of Heloise and Abelard was the kind of high romanticism that was very popular in the 1920's, and coasted into the early 30's before the harsh realities of the Depression swept it away.  Similarly, this movie tells a story about characters that audiences of the 1920's and 1930's might have been expected to be inherently familiar with; but it fails to establish those characters in any way on its own.

By the nature of what it attempts to do, this is an unusual movie, and of interest to film students.  But by its failure to actually do what it sets out to do, I did not find it moving or enjoyable to watch.

8391277,5,B0038FH70A,"Leslie Halliwell, one of the hardest to please critics ever, gave this film his highest praise and called it better than The Sun Also Rises. This story of WWI vets who refuse to return to America and remain in Paris and Lisbon to enjoy lots of drinking and carousing [made while Prohibition was still on in the US, this film probably made a stone cold sober audience feel vicariously drunk] covers similar territory as Hemingway's book, and so comparisons are apt, but the film isn't so much about the darkness underlying friendships and romances that makes them impossible, as it is about the difficulty all veterans face after a war of finding understanding for their experience and a place called home.

The film was based on a book by John Monk Saunders, also a WWI vet, whose stories and screenplays include The Docks of New York, Wings, A Yank at Oxford, and The Dawn Patrol. Saunders was married to Fay Wray but he mistreated her (adultery and he tried to inject her with drugs while she was sleeping once) and they divorced. He eventually killed himself in 1940.

That fate should not come as a surprise for those who watch The Last Flight. These vets are suffering from a deep sense of suicidal thanatos. Their ploy to stay alive is to drink and party and travel so much that they forget their war wounds and death can't find them. For most of the film, their strategy works and this ""band of brothers"" becomes one of the most fun-loving, jubilant groups of Merry Men (and one woman) the movies have given us. With them we encounter colorful details (like jeweled turtles swimming in a bathtub or the woman's holding a man's dentures in a champagne glass so he can join a fist-fight), humor (the sequence where each, having drunk so much they need to go to the bathroom, excuse themselves from the table with euphemistic missions), plain silliness (the recurring lines, ""I'll take vanilla"" or ""It seemed like a good idea at the time""), and even attempts at poignancy (the search for heart-shaped stones at the tomb of Heloise and Abelard). These drunks may not look like much on the surface, but their attempt to make life continue to work for them is as heroic as the aerial combat that begins the film.

[By the way, after seeing the film, I visited the tomb of Heloise and Abelard in Paris. It looks very different from the set that appears in The Last Flight. The tomb is outdoors and surrounded by a gate-like fence. To search for heart-shaped stones you literally have to get on the ground and stick your hand through the bars to dig them out of the ground. At least I had to. Maybe the gate is open at certain times but it wasn't when I was there. Nevertheless, I was able to secure stones that really looked like hearts. As it turned out, the most emotional thing about the tomb, however, wasn't this long-forgotten legend about heart-shaped stones. It was that visitors to the site routinely place or throw bouquets of flowers over the gate (often their own wedding bouquets) that land on the tomb of this tragic couple whose love was thwarted.]

I'm loath to spoil the end, but...Let's just say that if you've seen Bonjour Tristesse, Tops, or any of several films with a structure that is 99% fun followed by a brief 1% apocalypse (the same structure often followed by real-life bands like say The Beatles), you know that the fun can't last forever and that bands can also disband. But before the journey's end, the energy and exuberance of the journey itself is a high-balloon flight.

The film is not perfect, of course. It's largest fault is some stiff, stilted acting and at other times the actors wearing just a bit too much make-up. Some of the editing and shot compositions are practically avant-garde (which will either throw or delight you depending on your taste). But the film's faults are so minor and excusable when compared with the virtues of the film's content: it's lively, quirky characters, its dialogue, it's surprises and vitality.

For years this film could not be seen. While it could be rented and shown on 16mm, there was never a legitimate VHS release (only black market ones). Nor did it show on television. I don't know why. The Film Forum in New York resurrected it for one of their Pre-Code festivals and TCM finally aired it, but as you can see, it has come late to DVD in a ""print on demand"" format that still proves it to be a film less-known and less-lauded than it should be. As someone who really loves this film, I can't thank Warner Archive strongly enough for making it more widely available and I highly recommend that you buy it. If you haven't seen or even heard of it before, it has the potential to become one of your favorite films, as it is already one of mine.

8391278,4,B0038FH70A,"""The Last Flight"", a 1931 Warner Brothers production, is a very special film full of interesting and unusual features. This is a film which has generated in recent years much comment, often heralded as a forgotten masterpiece. I recommend that any potential viewer do some research first because otherwise, they may dismiss it as poor entertainment which would be missing the point. Here are some points of intrigue:

- the film is possibly the best celluloid record of the ""Lost Generation"", the men who survived World War 1 but returned to civilisation with no future, mentally shattered from their experience (nothing has changed). This is the generation described by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway in some of their novels.
- the film was the American debut of the German William Diertele. The lighting and staging have a Germanic look and there are some terrific transitions using clever dissolves.
- the star of the film is the enigmatic Richard Barthelmess, superbly cast as the ""leader"" of 4 comrades plus one interloper played by the venal Walter Byron. This is pre-code Hollywood and the interloper is a sex predator while all the others want to do is ""get tight"" and stay that way.
- the female lead is played by Helen Chandler, a wealthy playgirl as lost as the men but with some hope for the future. Chandler's part is extraordinarily complex and she is stunning.
- the script if full of non-sequiturs with no discernable plot, reflecting the vacuum in which these characters exist.

This is a film which requires careful attention. It is an extraordinary document but it is no wonder that it was a box office flop because this is anything but shallow Hollywood entertainment. For those who wish to park any preconceived notions, it could be a very moving experience.

The film has been released in the no frills Warner's Archive Collection. This means the print is unrestored, there are no extras and it is very expensive. In this case, the print is adequate.",1280620800,18,1982,4.8753709198813056
