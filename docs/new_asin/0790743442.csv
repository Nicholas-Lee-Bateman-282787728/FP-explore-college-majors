113874,5,0790743442,I love this movie. The singing and dancing is great. My favorite scene is when Jimmy tap dances down the stairs of the white house.,998092800,2,131,4.28
113875,5,0790743442,"""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is my favorite movie musical. It has the best patriotic songs, all done by George M. Cohan. Cagney vibrates and electrifies the screen (or TV set) with his tour-de-force song-and-dance performance of song-and-dance man George M. Cohan. Director Michael Curtiz (""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Casablanca"") keeps the film moving at a brisk pace, yet also finds time for George Cohan backstage and with his family. This is arguably James Cagney's triumph, and he deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor. His dancing is mind-blowing, to say the least. Along with ""The Wizard of Oz"", this is one movie musical that will bring me joy for years to come.",991785600,,670,4.991071428571429
113876,5,0790743442,"Is there any doubt that Michael Curtiz was one of the most versatile directors ever!. What point would it make to list any of his films he did them all with a style.
Its Cagney,s Show of course , but the staging of  the songs..flag waving..great supporting cast and general wrap up leaves no  viewer wanting.
Rosemary DeCamp and Walter Huston plays Cagney,s  parents. a Chance to see actors like Richard Whorf and some of the rest of  the Warner comapny...S.Z. Sakall, George Tobias they are all here. Cagney to  Elvis ..Curtiz did it. James Cagney..a legend and an institution !

113877,5,0790743442,"GREAT FILM!  And making it to the top 100 (for the 100 best movies ever made), this musical starring James Cagney as George M. Cohan is about the life of Cohan and the 4 Cohan's.  George Cohan, wrote songs such as  ""The Yankee Doodle Boy"", ""Give My Regards to Broadway"",  ""Overthere"", ""You're a Grand Old Flag"",  ""Mary"", ""Off The Record"", ""H.A.R.R.I.G.A.N.""  etc....
In this movie playing his sister (Josie Cohan), is really his  real sister (Jeanne Cagney). And on the set, Eddie Foy was played by a son  of his (Eddie Foy Jr.). At the ending when James Cagney is walking down the  stairs, then is tap dancing was not in the script. Originally Cagney was to  just walk down,  the rest he improvised.
If you're interested in musicals  with good stories to tell and song & dances numbers (that were first  done by Cohan when the plays first came out and were a big hit.), this  would be a good movie to get for your classic musical collection.",960940800,71,942,4.497041420118343
113878,5,0790743442,"James Cagney IS this film.  Yes, the songs are entertaining and the story is well told (which is surprising to hear from someone like me who does not like musicals).  But from the moment he comes on camera, he takes control  of the film.  The word dynamic is usually used to describe this  performance, and that's because it's the perfect word.  Cagney sings, he  dances, he jokes, and he delivers dramatically, too.  Surprisingly, he was  a great dancer, with a sort of stiff legged kind of style I've never seen  before, but it works.  The movie is very patriotic, and sometimes it seems  to be too much, but you don't really pay attention to that because Cagney  fills the screen.  What a star performance!",957225600,4,709,4.612903225806452
113879,5,0790743442,"My mother bought me a copy of this fantastic movie when I was nine. I watched it over and over for a solid week! Filled with the patriotic songs of George M. Cohan, the lengendary song and dance man, this is American  film making at its best. Cagney's exuberant puppety dancing style is a joy  to behold. A classic!",946512000,6,315,4.322033898305085
113880,5,0790743442,"George M. Cohan, himself, gave Cagney great praise for this film.  He was the perfect choice to play Cohan.  The music and songs are all Cohan classics.  Thanks be to Cohan for his contributions to America, and thanks  to Cagney for being ""up"" to playing the part of such an American  legend.  There is more to history than wars, treaties, and presidents.",935798400,,355,4.645161290322581
113881,5,0790743442,"JAMES CAGNEY'S performance as George M. Cohan is a singular achievment in motion picture history.  He combines his formidable acting skill with a quirky song-and-dance style to deliver an unashamedly exuberant performance  so full of joy and swagger that forgotten in the euphoria is how briddled  the movie is by its unfortunate adherence to the standard bio-pic format of  the time--overindulgent sentimentality, laborious plot turns,  ""corny"" dialogue, shallow interpretation of characters,  etc...--however,  this is Cagney's movie.  His dynamic performance is  beyond reproach and obscures any criticism made about the film as a whole.",922579200,3,640,5.795698924731183

113905,5,0790743442,"James Cagney was a natural.  Born with a quick brilliant mind and a compact agile body, this legendary actor-dancer-singer couldn't help but become an instant movie sensation in the 1930's.  And his old movies today are just as fresh and vibrant as they were nearly a century ago.  Cagney was destined to play George M. Cohan in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".  He didn't just ACT the part.  He BECAME the character.  And Cagney's inspired performance makes it clearly evident that he and Cohan were kindred spirits. This rousing musical is a great and inspiring production.  It's one of Hollywood's finest.  And it's one of James Cagney's best performances.  Don't miss it!",1517529600,2,665,4.972727272727273

113908,5,0790743442,"LOVE this movie, James Cagney, his dancing, and the marvelous Walter Huston.  But my main reason for leaving a review is to mention Rosemary DeCamp, the wonderful actress who played George M. Cohan's mother.  I started out as a film major way back when, and it irks me that for some reason she gets like 6th billing- why, Irene Manning, who played Fay Templeton and was lesser known than DeCamp, had just a few minutes of screen time, and got higher billing.  Mystifying.  DeKamp was a Hollywood mainstay, much loved (a favorite of mine), and next to James Cagney probably the most recognizable person in the film.

DeCamp (1910- 2001) had a long show-biz career, starting in 1937 (after first working as a newspaper reporter) and continuing until the mid 80s.  In addition to radio, films, and commercials (e.g., 20 Mule Team Borax), she was in dozens of TV shows, from The Life of Riley, Rawhide and Death Valley Days to Petticoat Junction, That Girl (Ann Marie's mother), The Partridge Family (Shirley Jones's mother), and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (Buck's mother).  After Spring Byington (whose acting career began in 1908 (!) and lasted until I Dream of Jeannie and The Flying Nun in the late 60's), DeCamp is probably identified as ""mom"" more than anyone else in the 20th century.  She was also famed for Howard Hughes crashing an experimental plane into her house in Beverly Hills.  She and her husband were in bed and the wing of the plane just missed them.  Anyway, no-one seems to mention her and she lent her dignity, beauty and quiet grace to the film as Cohan's mother (though curiously she was 11 years younger than Cagney).

And while I'm waxing nostalgic on trivia surrounding the film, regarding the marvelous Walter Huston (father of director John Huston, grandfather of actress Angelica), who plays the elder Cohan- in 1909, at age 26, he fell in love with one Mina Rose, age 44.  He saw her on stage, and left his wife & job as the manager of a power plant to tour in Vaudeville with her. Divorced in 1924, when he was 41 & she 59, they were together for 15 years.  For me his best film was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodsworth/dp/B01DBCOA4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodsworth</a>, just wonderful.

BTW, in Yankee Doodle Dandy Josie Cohan, George's sister, is played by Cagney's real life sister Jeanne.  Cagney is over the top in this film.  He began as a dancer in 1919, dancing was his real love and it shows.  No-one else displays such exuberance- a joy to watch (and I'm not much of fan of dance, but Cagney's in a class all his own).  If you haven't seen this you MUST- perfect for the 4th of July, patriotic American schmaltz of the highest order.

113909,5,0790743442,My favorite movie of all time. Jimmy Cagney is exceptional in his role of George M. Cohan. He sings. He dances - who knew the man could dance like that? I certainly didn't when I first saw this movie. I had only thought he was a straight actor. But he could tap like the best of them. This tale of the rise of one of the greatest composers of his time is entertaining and eminently watchable. I've been watching it since I first saw it with my father when I was a teenager and I'm still watching it now when I am in my late 50ies. I will continue to watch it.,1515283200,3,559,4.0

I so enjoy Yankee Doodle Dandy movie and this Blue Ray format.

Just wanted to tip my hat to times gone bye.  Still a damned good show.",1470009600,6,439,3.977272727272727
114060,5,0790743442,"By the 1940's James Cagney had grown tired of all the gangster roles he had become famous for and really sinks his teeth into the role of George M. Cohan, a vaudeville performer who started in humble beginnings in showbiz and ended up entertaining the nation for many decades and many wars. Watching him sing and dance is a real treat, he was a real natural at it (I especially love the Yankee Doodle Dandy number). He's well supported by Joan Leslie as his love interest and eventual wife Mary and Walter Huston as his dad.

One scene I really find funny is when some youngsters stop at Cohan's house when they have car trouble and he is irked that they don't even know his name (scary because I do think there are many young people who don't even have the slightest idea who Cagney is because they think B&W movies are 'beneath' them, the younger generation of the 21st century scare me as much as this movie's hipsters did Cohan). This gets Cohan, who by now is up in years, yearning to return to the stage.

A real treasure that I would recommend to any Cagney fan or anyone who just happens to love good old-fashioned entertainment.",1470009600,3,1137,4.461538461538462

This movie is another ""must see"" for a viewer seeking pure entertainment or studying Hollywood history.  In the event that it matters, it is NOT an accurate biography of George M. Cohan.

This movie is very patriotic.  It was released in early 1942, a few months after Pearl Harbor and a dark time for America.

 James Cagney usually played the quintessential gangster in his day (famous for saying ""You dirty rat"" right before machine gunning them to oblivion), but this musical about George M. Cohan and his family shows Cagneys true talents. He could sing decently (although he likes to ""talk/sing"" sometimes) and he was the bomb diggity when it comes to dance/tap moves.
 When I was a kid I wanted to run and jump on the wall into a back flip so bad it killed me, but my mom wouldn't let me practice that at home. Thanks a lot mom!

114274,5,0790743442,"The amazing piece of timing here is when Warner Bros. began work on this biography of entertainer George M. Cohan, WWII had not yet broken out. The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred the day before shooting began. When the film opened people on the home front badly needed some morale boosting, and this film gave it to them. It's just a joyous musical costume piece from start to finish with nice comic touches balanced with some sentimental moments (supposedly Walter Huston's deathbed scene had even taskmaster director Michael Curtiz crying). There's nothing in the way of real conflict or even much heavy in the way of romance between Cohan and his fictitious film wife ""Mary"", who was modeled after Cohan's actual second wife in some ways. Cohan was actually married twice. Oddly enough, it was Cohan who said he wanted as little romance in the film as possible.

The more I learn about Cohan the more I realize that Cagney was perfect to play him - both Irish Americans, both about the same size and build, and George Cohan's style of dancing and singing were about the same as Cagney's. It's hard to believe that Fred Astaire was Cohan's first choice to play himself. Astaire was a great talent, but I don't think he could have conveyed the combination of mischief, optimism and energy that was Cohan the way that Cagney ultimately did. Several people criticize Cagney's dancing here, but that eccentric style was Cohan's, who always considered himself more of an overall entertainer than a dancer in the first place.

If you're ""date conscious"" as I am, there are some matters of plot that might bother you. Cohan was born on July 2 or 3, not July 4. Cohan's mother outlived his father by eleven years and Cohan's father was not ""very old"" when he died as is said in the film - at least by today's standards. When Cohan's father died in 1917, he was only 69. Cohan's sister did die young - she was only 39, dying in 1916, plus she was not his little sister. Instead Josie was a year older than George. The film has Josie marrying when she would have been close to forty, when she actually married at the beginning of the 20th century and thus was the one to break up the four Cohans, not George. Also, Cohan received his Congressional Medal in 1936, not as WWII began as shown in the film. However the plot device of having George M. recount his life story to FDR, receiving his Congressional medal in the Oval Office, and then dance joyously down the White House stairs and into the streets joining a group of marching soldiers in a chorus of ""Over There"" was probably a great way to bridge Cohan's patriotic past with what was then an uncertain time that certainly needed a dose of his optimism.

The one thing that I did find a little odd - and one thing isn't much in a two plus hour long movie - is that it is hard to spot the actual point in the film where Mary becomes George's wife. There is quite a bit of domesticity shown before the two were married. Mary is cooking for George, staying in his apartment alone waiting for him to come home from the show, and acting very much like they are already married. The only way you know they are not is that George very subtly pops the question to the point that I'm surprised even Mary knew what he was asking! I know this doesn't seem like much in today's world, but considering that they were trying to paint Cohan in the most positive light possible and that the living arrangements might be misunderstood, I am surprised that the censors of that time never raised the issue.

At any rate, I highly recommend this one. You'll have a great time, at least in part because you can see that Cagney is having a great time. He always said this film was his favorite, and it shows in his performance.",1435881600,,3755,4.493411420204978

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Producer Hal Wallis originally envisioned 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' as a straightforward biography of one of Broadway's most successful and prolific impresarios, George M. Cohan, but America's entrance into World War II a few months before its release transformed this lavish musical into a rousing, flag-waving propaganda piece that stirred the passions and stoked the resolve of a nervous, uncertain nation. Like his titular alter ego, Cohan claimed he was born on the 4th of July (3rd of July is his actual birth date), and for most of his life the pint-sized dynamo symbolised Americana. Though George M. Cohan wrote his most famous and patriotic songs like 'You're a Grand Old Flag,' 'Over There,' 'Give My Regards to Broadway,' and the timeless title tune. In the early part of the 20th Century, they all struck a renewed chord with 1942 audiences, propelling 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' to monumental success. Yet despite its eight Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, some of the film's lustre has faded over time. 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' still entertains today, but seems more old-fashioned than most musicals of the era; a quaint, featherweight period piece that sadly lacks any emotional pulls beyond love of country.

George M. Cohan once said about himself: ""Once a song-and-dance man, always a song-and-dance man."" And the same holds true for the actor who immortalized him on screen, James Cagney. In his autobiography, James Cagney writes, ""Psychologically I needed no preparation for 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' or professionally either. I didn't have to pretend to be a song-and-dance man. I was one."" Cagney, of course, rose to film stardom playing gangsters and wise-guys, but was also an adroit hoofer and he showed off his tapping skills most notably in Busby Berkeley's 'Footlight Parade,' and cut his theatrical teeth on Broadway musicals. George M. Cohan even rejected him for one of his shows when James Cagney was first starting out. Though smashing a half-grapefruit in Mae Clarke's face in 'The Public Enemy' put him on the cinematic map, portraying a Broadway legend would win James Cagney a Best Actor Academy Award and cement his reputation as an immensely talented, multi-faceted performer.

Ironically, George M. Cohan was not too far removed from the pugnacious punks James Cagney often played on screen. Instead of a gun, George M. Cohan wielded arrogance, and his cocksure attitude alienated many a Broadway cohort. Refreshingly, 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' doesn't shy away from depicting George M. Cohan's abrasive personality, insufferable ego, and brazen ambition and quite a feat, considering George M. Cohan's contract granted him complete script approval and the power to cancel the film's release if he disapproved of the finished product. The unprecedented deal completely stressed out studio chief Jack L. Warner, who heaved a huge sigh of relief when George M. Cohan at last gave the movie his blessing. George M. Cohan adamantly opposed any depiction of his domestic life, so the writers merged his two wives into one, and created a new name for the character Mary, after the popular George M. Cohan song, Mary's A Grand Old Name. Sixteen-year-old Joan Leslie landed the part, playing opposite the 42-year-old James Cagney, and in keeping with Cohan's wishes, the two rarely express any affection for each other during the film. In real life, George M. Cohan fathered four children, but none appear in the film. Joan Leslie could only work limited hours each day, because she had to attend school on the Warner Bros. lot, but somehow Joan Leslie and James Cagney make a believable couple and manage to minimise the vast age difference. Interestingly, Rosemary DeCamp, who played George M. Cohan's mother, was also a relative youngster and 11 years James Cagney's junior!

The film's cut-and-dried plot focuses almost exclusively on George M. Cohan's career and is almost completely devoid of any dramatic impact. Told in flashback, the tale begins as an elderly George M. Cohan receives the Congressional Medal of Honor from President Franklin D. Roosevelt [Jack Young], which inspires the blustery thespian to regale Franklin D. Roosevelt with his life story. We then follow Cohan from his humble beginnings as part of his parents' vaudeville act to his juvenile success as Peck's Bad Boy, his tenure as one of the singing Four Cohans and the other three were his father [Walter Huston], mother [Rosemary DeCamp], and sister [Jeanne Cagney] and eventual renown as Broadway composer, lyricist, actor, and producer, who sometimes had five hit shows running simultaneously on The Great White Way. Any personal strife, beyond the death of his father, is ignored, which leaves the film emotionally bereft. Historical inaccuracies also abound, and as we bounce from one song to another, with only negligible chatter and some comic shtick in between, a bit of ennui sets in, despite the lively numbers and spirited performances. Outside of successful shows and some mild family squabbling, nothing of note really happens to George M. Cohan, and the lack of any cohesive narrative makes it difficult to invest in the characters and remain involved in the film. Songwriter biopics often suffer from such a malaise, because let's face it, most composers lead normal, insulated, rather boring existences. Their songs may provide great entertainment, but their lives, generally, do not.

James Cagney agreed to star in 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' partially to quell any lingering rumours about his supposed Communist sympathies, spawned from his years as a ""strong Roosevelt liberal"" in the 1930s. Playing the all-American George M. Cohan, a man whom many thought really was ""a real live nephew"" of Uncle Sam; put a stop to any whispers about James Cagney's patriotism. And James Cagney gave the role his all, ceaselessly studying George M. Cohan and adopting his trademark stiff-limbed dance style, vocal timbre, and stage persona. Simply from the standpoint of stamina, it's an admirable performance, and James Cagney's triple-threat abilities undoubtedly helped him snag the OSCAR Best Actor, the first time a musical performer garnered the award.

And the film's dozen or so musical numbers are really what 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' is all about. Michael Curtiz, whose next film would be the Oscar winning 'Casablanca,' had never before directed a musical, but seems to have a firm grasp on the genre, constructing modest yet effective song sequences that reflect the simplicity of George M. Cohan's music and don't require any suspensions of disbelief. Michael Curtiz also received an OSCAR nomination for his work, as did Walter Huston for Best Supporting Actor, but it is James Cagney's presence that looms the largest over this sprightly piece of hokum. His performance remains strong and captivating more than seven decades later, and though his fine work can't mask the film's lack of substance, he keeps 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' relevant, inspiring plenty of admiration, and proving he really is that yankee doodle boy.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Classic film lovers rejoice! Warner Archive Collection has delivered yet another scrumptious 1080p encoded image transfer of this vintage title, one that beautifully captures the original look and feel of 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' and James Wong Howe's exceptional cinematography. Superior contrast and stunning clarity lend the image presence and depth, while a natural grain structure provides a palpable film-like appearance. When compared to the inferior 2003 NTSC DVD, the Blu-ray picture looks more vibrant and exhibits far less texture. Blacks are stronger and deeper, and the grey scale flaunts more distinct variations. Background details are easy to discern, shadow delineation is quite good, and close-ups show off fine facial features well. Best of all, not a single speck, mark, or scratch mars the pristine source material, and no digital doctoring, such as edge sharpening or noise reduction, seems to have been applied. Black-and-White musicals generally pale in comparison to their Technicolor cousins, but this stellar transfer makes us miss those saturated hues just a little bit less. Never has 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' looked this good, and making an upgrade is essential for fans of this flag-waving film.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono track supplies robust sound that's somewhat limited by the recording equipment of the early 1940s. Though any trace of age-related imperfections, such as hiss, pops, and crackles, have been scrubbed away by Warner technicians, the audio lacks the same degree of fidelity and tonal depth that often distinguishes M-G-M musicals of the period. Still, this solid effort proves the OSCARS the film won for Best Musical Score and Best Sound Recording were warranted, despite a slight nagging shrillness that occasionally creeps into the mix. Distortion, however, is absent, dialogue is always clear and comprehendible, and the tapping from James Cagney's fancy footwork is crisp and distinct. For a 72-year-old film, 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' sounds darn good, and though the audio never dazzles, this is still a grand old track.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Warner Bros. Historian Rudy Behlmer: Film historian Rudy Behlmer always provides top-notch audio commentaries, and his discussion of 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' doesn't disappoint. Rudy Behlmer edited a book comprised of  Warner Bros studio memos, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of the Burbank dream factory fuels this informative and absorbing track. Rudy Behlmer date stamps almost all the scenes in the film and names the soundstages on which they were shot. In addition, he points out several historical inaccuracies and identifies some music in the film that wasn't written by George M. Cohan. He also talks about the incessant rewrites that plagued the production, James Cagney's quick-witted improvisations, the star's intense dislike of fellow actor S.Z. Sakall, and how teenage leading lady Joan Leslie had to adhere to child labour laws during shooting. Anecdotes abound, including one that concerns George M. Cohan's rejection of a young, unknown Cagney when the novice actor auditioned for one of the impresario's shows early in his career. When it comes to commentaries, Rudy Behlmer is the best in the business, and this essential track will fascinate anyone with an interest in classic films.

Special Feature: Introduction by Leonard Maltin: Warner Night at the Movies 1942 [3:21] The critic and film historian provides an introduction to the various short subjects from 1942 listed below. Then followed by the Feature Film Yankee Doodle Dandy.

Theatrical Trailer: Casablanca [480i] [1.33:1] [2:16] Written by Julius and Irving Epstein, who did uncredited rewrites on Yankee Doodle Dandy.

Newsreel [1942] [480i] [1.33:1] [9:16] A West Point graduation; the U.S. air corps in China; volunteers for naval service in Houston; Mexico declares war; British tanks to the U.S.S.R.; the air corps in Australia; FDR reviews the troops.

Warner Bros. Patriot Short Subject: Beyond the Call of Duty [1942][480i] [1.33:1] [22:01] Narrated by Ronald Reagan, this Warner Brothers short in support of the war effort focuses on the exploits of Army Air Corps Captain Hewett T. Wheless and his exploits just after the U.S. entry into World War II. He was a ranch hand before enlisting and the film recreates his training with Army Air Corps Captain Hewett T. Wheless eventually commanding a bomber. On a mission, his aircraft encountered 18 Japanese Zeros but he managed to safely return to base, despite the severe damage to his aircraft. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism.

Vintage Warner Bros. Merry Melodies Cartoon: Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid [1942] [1080p] [7:25] The cartoon begins with a mother buzzard instructing her children to go out and catch something for dinner. They set off right away except one with his back turned. This is Beaky Buzzard (Killer) who is shy and a little on the slow side. Against his will, his mother kicks him out of the nest with instructions to at least catch a rabbit. Beaky spots Bugs Bunny and soars down to catch him. Bugs makes like an air-traffic controller and ""guides"" Beaky to the ground with a crash. After some heckling, a chase ensues ending with Bugs crashing into the ground underneath the skeleton of a dead animal. He cries because he thinks he's dead (""Gruesome, isn't it?"", he briefly confides to the audience), but it turns he knew he was okay the whole time. Beaky and Bugs jitterbug together. Bugs says, ""Why don't we do this more often,"" to which Beaky replies, ""Ya mean just what we're doing tonight?"" This is a quote of the first line of the song ""Why Don't We Do This More Often?"" After the dance with Bugs, Beaky ends up underground with the skeleton above. He summons his mother and she shows up. At first the mother buzzard thinks Bugs did something to Beaky. Bugs Bunny pulls Beaky out of the ground. Noticing that Beaky is unharmed, the mother abandons her desire to eat Bugs and declares him her hero and kisses him. A blushing Bugs Bunny imitates Beaky. The cartoon, directed by Bob Clampett, and produced by Leon Schlesinger.

Special Feature Documentary: Let Freedom Sing! The Story of Yankee Doodle Dandy [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [44:31] This comprehensive documentary meticulously chronicles the biopic's journey to the screen, providing historical background on the George M. Cohan family, production details, and notes on the film's impact and lasting appeal. Among other things, we learn how the script evolved from a straight drama into a musical; how the influence of James Cagney's brother, William, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor affected the movie's production; how James Cagney's sister, Jeanne, beat out Ruby Keeler for the role of James Cagney's sister in the film; and how George M. Cohan originally approached Fred Astaire to portray him. James Cagney's love-hate relationship with director Michael Curtiz is also examined, along with James Cagney's improvisations on set, and George M. Cohan's death shortly after the film was released. Actress Joan Leslie, who played James Cagney's wife in 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' actor John Travolta, and film historians Rudy Behlmer, Robert Osborne, and Bob Thomas, among other noteworthy contributors, comment on this beloved piece of Americana and how it still resonates today.

Special Feature: John Travolta Remembers James Cagney [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:09] In his later years, James Cagney did not typically meet new people, but he made an exception for John Travolta when their mutual friend, producer A.C. Lyles, informed James Cagney that the newly minted star was a dancer. The star of 'Grease' recalls his lifelong fascination with James Cagney, how 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' was his favourite film as a child, and how an emotional meeting with the legendary actor spawned a close relationship that continued until James Cagney's death.

Special Feature Vintage Wartime Short: You, John Jones [1943] [480i] [1.33:1] [10:26] This war time-effort short subject, directed by Mervyn LeRoy 'Quo Vadis' and 'The Bad Seed,' features James Cagney as an everyman air raid warden who, while on duty one night, expresses his gratitude to God that the U.S. has not been bombed like other countries around the world, and that his wife [Ann Sothern] and young daughter [Margaret O'Brien] are safe. He then envisions the horrors his daughter would face if they resided in such hotspots as England, Greece, China, Yugoslavia, France, and Russia. Though James Cagney's earnest portrayal rings true, moppet O'Brien who a year before she would gain renown as Judy Garland's impish sister in 'Meet Me in St. Louis' is the short's real star, and it's amazing the six-year-old actress wasn't scarred for life after enduring the barrage of harrowing situations that befall her character. One minute she's an amputee, the next a starving street urchin. In between, she survives two traumatic bombing scenes and shows up dead in the rubble in two others (once with her eyes open)...all in the span of 10 minutes! The short's subject matter is serious, but the rapid-fire, hyper-dramatic presentation of such unrelieved strife does provoke a chuckle or two. To top it all off, Margaret O'Brien must also recite large sections of the Gettysburg Address in preparation for a school recitation contest...and to stoke the patriotic passions of the audience! It's quite a performance, and definitely merits a look.

Special Feature Vintage Animated Warner Bros. Looney Tunes Cartoon Short: Yankee Doodle Daffy [1943] [1080p] [1.33:1] [6:44] Despite its suggestive title, this Looney Tunes cartoon has nothing to do with 'Yankee Doodle Dandy,' but it's an entertaining romp in its own right. Daffy Duck, agent to the stars, complete with business card that flashes like a theatre marquis, does everything he can to convince Porky Pig of ""Smeller Productions"" that his preadolescent client ""Sleepy LaGoon"" can become a star. This annoys Porky Pig, as it is his day off and he has planned to play golf. Daffy Duck spends most of the cartoon telling Porky about what his client can do, while actually performing various shticks himself, in his usual wild and frenetic way. After trying various ways to escape, Porky locks Daffy in a huge vault and takes off in a plane only to find out that the pilot of the plane was Daffy. Porky then jumps out with a parachute while Daffy follows. Porky then gets chased back to his office. Finally, Porky Pig relents and asks to see what his client can do. ""Sleepy,"" a small and droopy-eyed Daffy Duck, who has whiled away the episode slurping a huge all-day sucker which he keeps in a banjo case, finally gets to perform. ""Sleepy"" begins to sing a song in a strong baritone voice. He starts out well, then tries to hit a high note, and goes into a coughing fit as the cartoon ends.

Feature Audio Vault [Audio Only] You Remind Me of My Mother (Outtake); Youre a Grand Old Flag (James Cagney Rehearsal); Give My Regards to Broadway (James Cagney Rehearsal); Four Cohens Medley (Vocal with Piano) and Harrigan (Vocal with Piano).

Feature Audio Vault [Audio Only] Lady Esther Screen Guild Theater Radio Show [19th October, 1942] [29:31] A radio presentation of highlights from Yankee Doodle Dandy featuring James Cagney, Joan Leslie, Walter Huston, Jeanne Cagney, Richard Whorf, and S. Z. Sakall all reprising their film roles. Cut down to a lean 30 minutes, including commercials, introduction, and farewells, this telling of 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' foregoes plot in favour of music, and ends up little more than a prolonged medley of George M. Cohan hits. Audio quality is a bit rough, but we're lucky this treasured relic still exists at all.

Special Feature: Screen Selection from the film: Yankee Doodle Dandy provides a listing of twenty songs performed during the film, to which the viewer can jump directly to and they consist of: Medley [Yankee Doodle/Yankee Doodle Boy/Marys a Grand Old Name]; The Dancing Master; Pecks Bad Boy [The Dancing Master]; I Was Born in Virginia; The Warmest Baby in the Bunch; Harrigan and Yankee Doodle Boy [Little Johnny Jones #1].

Finally, George M. Cohan was an American institution, and though 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' takes great liberties with his life story, Michael Curtiz's rousing and if formulaic biopic salutes the man and his music with plenty of warmth, reverence, and patriotic fervour. James Cagney's OSCAR winning portrayal, distinguished by his distinctive, vigorous dancing, anchors the film and cracks its corny veneer, while more than a dozen of George M. Cohan's most recognizable tunes comprise the truly American soundtrack. Though slim on plot, 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' coasts along on the strength of its music, performances, and production values, winning us over with its irrepressible charm. Warner Archive's Blu-ray presentation honours this OSCAR winning film with a brilliant video transfer that improves upon the previous inferior NTSC DVD, but with this Blu-ray you get a high-quality mono audio, and a cavalcade of absorbing supplements. Though it never rivals the musicals made across town by M-G-M, 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' remains a prime example of old-fashioned, rock-'em-sock-'em entertainment and its undeniable patriotism makes it deserving of an annual spin on 4th July. Very Highly Recommended!

It' very misleading. As another reviewer kind of mentioned, if you've ever seen the movie in color you just can't get the same excitement out of the black and white version. I wrote Amazon and they immediately sent me a return label and said they'd send me the correct version. This was on Dec 9th. Today, Dec 11th, I received the second DVD (very quick service by Amazon). However, it's the exact same black and white set. This two-disc special edition may be listed as ""colorized"" because the 2nd disk in the set (the 1st disk is the black and white movie) is a profile of the Hollywood legend, hosted by Michael J. Fox, and Michael's speaking parts are colorized. I'm very disappointed. I haven't seen the colorized version of the movie in years and was so looking forward to watching it again.

Cohan. They don't make musicals like this anymore!  The dance routines are amazing  as Cagney taps his toes so fast you will think this is a special effects trick, but No, Cagney had real talent as an actor, singer and dancer. He later was cast in tough gangster roles and then the as the famous gimp in Doris day's Hit - Love Me or Leave Me.

114404,4,0790743442,"Jimmy Cagney is not noted in film history for his dancing, but, in fact, he was an outstanding dancer and made several musicals in his early career. This tribute to George M. Cohen probably plays loose with the facts (Hollywood biographies always did), but Cagney shines as the Man Who Owned Broadway, and this film was so important to the Washington government that Franklin D. Roosevelt allows himself to be portrayed in it -- I believe the first time a sitting president allowed himself to be portrayed in a movie.

I am not a big fan of black-and-white musicals, but this one is special. For historians of musicals, and for those interested in the early New York stage productions when Cohen was performing, this is as close as we will ever get to seeing how he performed, for Cagney is reported to have copied Cohen's dancing style perfectly.",1416355200,,847,4.722972972972973

This is a must see for anyone, especially when it gets to the part of War time; the inspiration of being an American and George M. Cohan's contributions to the cause.

At the end, after meeting with The President, and Cagney walks down the stairs and starts tap dancing, I've read he ad-libbed/improvised that. To me, that scene made the entire picture.",1415232000,9,516,4.775280898876405

114427,5,0790743442,"When ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" opened in movie theatres across America in June of 1942, the country had been suddenly(and tragically) pulled into another World War with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. It was the perfect film to lift up the American spirit after such a devastating event as Pearl Harbor due in no small part by it's subject matter. George M. Cohan was not only born on the 4th of July, but wrote songs that were so patriotic that he could only be played on film by someone equal in stature. That person was James Cagney and in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" he gives the performance of a lifetime(which won him his only Oscar). He finally showed his studio that he was more than just a gangster and bad guy. Warner's has finally brought this outstanding film to Blu-ray through it's Warner Archive Collection and like their other releases, it's simply beautiful. Warner Home Video(separate from WAC) originally released ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" on a two-disc special edition DVD in 2003 and as good as that DVD was it really pales in comparison to this new Blu-ray upgrade from WAC which fans of the film have been requesting for years. Warner's has given ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" an above average bitrate(27.99) and the results are outstanding to say the least. The cinematography by the great James Wong Howe is really put on display with blacks and whites being sharp and detailed especially during the many musical numbers. It's those musical numbers which really shine now with even the smallest details(costumes, set designs, etc.) looking absolutely beautiful in all it's B & W glory. The only print damage(very minor) is during some of the flashback montage scenes but the majority of the film has been cleaned up of any vertical lines, specks, dirt, and other film damage and the result is a very pleasing and film like presentation. The Audio(English DTS-HD MA 2.0) has been improved too with all musical numbers being loud and clear, so much so that you'll have to lower the volume. The entire production is a joy to watch now that it has finally been released on Blu-ray. Despite being in B & W, it's one of the greatest musicals ever made and holds up well after more than seventy years. Acting honors must surely go to Cagney for his magnificent performance, but the supporting cast of the other three Cohans- Walter Huston, Rosemary Decamp, and Jeanne Cagney(Jimmy's real life sister) are just wonderful in their roles. Joan Leslie, who plays Cagney's love interest and soon to be wife, is equally outstanding. She and Cagney are just great in their scenes together. ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is 125 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.33:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include all the ones from the 2003 DVD except the biography of James Cagney. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a standard and sturdy case for added protection. ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is not only one of best musicals released by Warner Brothers but may be one the greatest ever. WAC has finally given this classic film the respect it deserves with a superb Blu-ray presentation that will please anyone viewing it for many years to come. It should occupy a space in every film collectors library and comes highly recommended.",1413504000,10,3256,4.857913669064748

114488,5,0790743442,"With a few exceptions (Christopher Walken, for example), most actors today are not cross-trained in dance and singing.  James Cagney, a strong actor who mostly portrayed the roles of gangsters, steps out in this song and dance movie about the life of theatrical producer George Cohan.  Cagney has a unique dancing style, and he goes full bore in this outstanding movie that is underrated on the AFI's list of the top 100 films (it is at 100, should be around 40).

George Cohan was quite a character.  An Irishman, he was once refused a room at a hotel because the hotel clerk thought he was Jewish.  Cohan replied ""We are both mistaken ... you thought I was Jewish and I thought you were a gentleman.""",1401321600,2,702,4.584

114503,5,0790743442,I LOVE this movie,1398297600,,17,3.5
114504,5,0790743442,"I love how when someone thinks of James Cagney they automatically think of his work on screen as a gangster to the point where when they hear that he actually won an Oscar they assume it is for one of those iconic roles and are somewhat shocked when they hear that it is for a biopic/musical, Yankee Doodle Dandy.  I was one of those people.  He was a song and dance man?  He did more than talk with a snarl and shoot people?

Yes, he did much, much more.

Ive known this for a while now, and it is precisely why I consider Cagney one of the greatest actors of any generation, but it is something that most people don't realize.  And while Im one who usually feels like Oscar tends to award actors for their lesser work in more acceptable or commercial fare, I have to say that Cagneys win for Yankee Doodle Dandy is one of the best moves Oscar ever made.  Not only is this Cagney at his finest, but it marked a pinnacle in his career.  After proving himself for quite a few years as a bankable and talented star, albeit typecast for sure, he came forward with his passion project that took him back to his vaudeville roots and earned him the respect of everyone.

And rightfully so.

Yankee Doodle Dandy tells the story of George M. Cohan, an arrogant child star who grew up in the vaudeville spotlight only to have his dreams feel somewhat suppressed until he took them by the hand and made them truly grow to the heights of Broadway.  The film beautifully maps out his internal growth as a person and a performer and balances out his flaws with his rousing contribution to the world of song and dance.  Ill be honest, when I first saw the poster for this film and read the synopsis, I was not interested.  Im not a very political man, and the story seemed ripe for melodrama, but there is something so light and fluid about the way that this film is crafted.  It never forsakes the weight aspects, but it captures everything in such jovial jubilance.  It all feels so compelling, so thoughtful and lighthearted, and the performances by the entire cast truly make for something special.  Cagney is on fire, but his supporting cast like Huston, Leslie, Whorf and DeCamp are all worthy of praise as well.

With dazzling sets, beautiful costumes and a script that entertains, educates and builds such intensely detailed characters, Yankee Doodle Dandy is about as perfect as they come!",1398211200,,2384,4.494199535962877

Michael Curtiz directed this fictionalized, unabashedly flag waving biopic of the first actor to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor, George M. Cohan. A delightful musical that covers his boyhood rise in late 19th Century vaudeville to national acclaim in the early 20th. There are recreations from several of George's stage hits, including LITTLE JOHNNY JONES (1904), the first American musical.

Cagney delights with singing and loose-jointed dancing, especially in the title song (from the previously mentioned ""Jones""). He's outstanding in an Oscar-winning turn as the man they erected a statue to on Broadway. Highest recommendation!

He wrote many patriotic songs.  James Cagney, known mostly for his performances in gangster movies, finally got a chance to show his singing and dancing talents, which were really his first life and love.

Its a movie based on the life of composer and showman George M. Cohan.

Jimmy Cagney turns out to be quite the song and dance man. He is energetic and having a good time throughout the movie and his enthusiasm made me appreciate the movie even more.

Granted it is a flag waver of a show, and if that bugs you, it may not be for you. But even so, the music is first class as is the production. Lots of familiar tunes.

I doubt it is especially faithful to George M. Cohan's real life. Biographical movies often fudge the facts to make for what the movie makers think is a better movie, especially in movies of that era.

Even with the minor warts, it deservedly is a classic of American film.

One of the few musicals I can stand to watch.",1372982400,,957,4.037037037037037

Before the big corporations held its viewing/airing rights, we would view this classic movie just about
anytime of the year.  These days, it's aired about July 3rd and/or July 4th.
I hope to own copy instead of streaming it or borrowing a copy from The New York Public Library.
The first time I viewed Yankee Doodle Dandy was on television in the 1950's.  James Cagney delighted and
entertained me in his role as George M. Cohan.  What a pleasant surprise!  Unlike his performances in
pictures like Public Enemy, Angels With Dirty Faces and G-Men.
James Cagney does sing about a notch better than Fred Astaire in Easter Parade. Both are good in carrying
a tune, a melody or a note.
These days, I watch this movie, at least, once a year on July 4th to observe and celebrate Independence Day.
With 231 reviews, you the reader have a good idea as to the quality of this movie. For me, I LOVED IT!
One final note, What does James Cagney, George Raft(the other tough guy actor), Tim Robbins (actor),
David Axelrod (Obama White House) and Lucy Liu (The View) all have in common???
They all attended the prestigious Stuyvesant High School.  During the 1950's, it was The Bronx High School
Of Science, Brooklyn Technical High School And Stuyvesant High School.",1372291200,,1346,4.638655462184874

James Cagney started out as a song-and-dance man on Broadway, and was in a few musical movies when he first came to Hollywood.  But the studio roped him into playing gangsters and other tough guys, and it was not until this movie that his long-dormant dancing skills finally came back into light.

114720,4,0790743442,"Starring James Cagney and an array of others, the film tells the real life story of writer, singer, and dancer George M. Cohan. The story begins with an older Cohan recounting his life story. He began his career with his family in Vaudeville. Slowly he made a name for himself in Broadway and married his love. He and his partner kept making musicals and then the Cohans reunited for one last show. Eventually everyone in the family settled down before they died. The only one left was George who was living with his wife. In his final performance, Cohan gets the country to rally around the flag again as he has done his whole life. This movie has many commendable moments but there is an apparent conflict between biography and musical. Cagney for his part gives a stellar performance as the energetic and ambitious Cohan. The film also doubled as a nice piece of propaganda during World War II.",1370044800,,897,4.647798742138365

This film also pushed the Committee of Unamerican Activities well and truly off Cagney's back, who then was not involved in the Communist bashing of the 1950's.

  Cagney sets the screen ablaze, and one is transported to a very joyful place.  Thus, when discussing what few things still entertained my brother-in-law, Ret. Marine Colonel, this came to mind.  Lifetime Red Sox fan, ""Fever Pitch"" is also a winner.  Sister tells me YDD had him tapping his foot.  A+ for everyone of any age, and the child in all of us.",1362614400,,541,4.505154639175258

So whethere your a song and dance fan or a die hard James Cagney lover, then you'll love this.  The movie itself is timeless, a somewhat fictionalized biogrophy of Broadway pioneer George M. Cohan and his rise from Vaudeville to Broadway creme de la creme.  The DVD is great with great extras to go along with it.  I especially love the look back at Cagney's career but the making of and the song list are great too.

So, I was not surprised to enjoy this movie.  The DVD quality is great and I was swept away again with this wonderful film.

What DID surprise me was the quality of the extras, especially on Disc 2.  Where some studios might settle for a collection of stills and a quick, 5-min bio, Warner Brothers went all out.  An EXCELLENT biography of the life and career of Cagney, hosted by Michael J. Fox no less, was captivating!  The ""making of"" presentation was extraordinary, explaining cast choices all the way down to Frances Langford, whose character barely gets named in the movie.  And then, there was a heart-warming interview with John Travolta, who became very close with Cagney in the last 5 years of his life.

Honestly, I thought I knew all of the trivia there was to know about this movie.  I found out I didn't even have a clue.  If you are a fan of classic movies, this is a good one.  If you are a fan of classic musicals, this is a must-see.  If you are a fan of Cagney, this movie is essential to your collection.

But if you are a fan of this particular movie, as I am, you will honestly be wondering how you've managed to not own this set already.  It is absolutely fabulous!!!",1357257600,,1452,4.422641509433962

114802,5,0790743442,"A joy from start to finish, the part Cagney was born to play.  The biography of George M. Cohan who ""owned"" Broadway in the early decades of the 20th century.  The film features lots of Cohan's songs, with their catchy melodies and clever lyrics.

Early in it's filming, Pearl Harbor was bombed so the patriotic aspects of the film were emphasized to good effect.  Remember in the early '40's no one knew who was going to prevail in World war II, and for all anyone knew this might be Freedom's last gasp.

Love the extras too, hours more of enjoyment.

Saw it for the first time in 35 years and loved it even more.

Great movies are treasures, just as fresh and enjoyable now as they were when they were made.

Cagney won an Academy Award for best actor and never was one so well-deserved.  His energy, joy and talent come through in every minute of this rousing spectacle.

The scene where he sings Yankee Doodle Dandy he does two high-speed pirouettes that were beyond perfection. Then he follows those up by literally tap dancing against the wall, with both feet touching the wall at the same time while he is briefly parallel to the ground. (Note: Don't try this at home, kids). I love the music so much I bought the CD of the soundtrack from Amazon and play it in my car every day.

Yankee Doodle Dandy is a timeless musical that introduces and will continue to introduce generation upon generation to the brilliance of George M. Cohan.",1341360000,,432,5.013888888888889
114861,5,0790743442,"One thing I expect on July 4th is something to watch that reminds me of my Yankee heritage. This year, there's no Boston Pops or movies--except one. Someone at a television station had enough consciousness and caffeine to air ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" today.

This is a musical that tells the story of George M. Cohan a singer, songwriter, and playwright who put his love of America in many of his plays in a way that only an American of Irish heritage can.  James Cagney played George M. Cohan with as much verve and more talent than the original. His tap dancing highlights much of the film in which he demonstrates the ability to have his limbs look like they dangle from the strings of a puppet. His performance also won him the Academy Award for best actor. Songs like the ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (of course), It's a Grand Old Flag,"" and ""Over There"" can still give the listener chills of national pride.

The story begins with a summons to the White House, George M. tells his story to the president, from his beginnings in Vaudeville, the bonds with his family and partner and his rise to stardom.

Rosemary DeCamp, Walter Huston, Jeanne Cagney play his mother, father and sister (who is also his real sister).  Joanne Leslie plays his wife, Mary, and Richard Whorf plays his partner, Sam Harris. They support a script that is a bit campy but reflects the strong bonds the Four Cohans had for each other and his ""contractless"" partnership with Harris. One of the best lines is George M. Cohan marching beside troops who are singing ""Over There,"" a song he wrote. An officer says to him, ""What's the matter, ol' timer, don't you remember this song?""

Naturally, the film took license with the facts. Rosemarie DeCamp, who played his mother was nine years younger than (her son), James Cagney. George M. was actually born July 3rd, not the 4th.  He was alos married twice. The last one was named Agnes Mary, but she always went by Agnes.

Two years ago I saw George M. Cohan's mausoleum in a cemetery of (other dead)celebrities in Woodlawn, New York. He died in 1942. I eagerly told a much younger man who was an aspiring history teacher. He asked, ""Who's that?"" I told him some of his achievements, perhaps a bit too emphatically. He defended his ignorance telling me he that he was born in 1984, not 1942. I reminded him that being a history teacher meant knowing about people and events before he was born. It doesn't look like he will become one--thank God!

Anyway, Happy Birthday, George! Some of us remember you.

114868,5,0790743442,"This is the story of the life of George Michael Cohan, an Irish American from a theatrical family who had the talent and the drive to do remarkable things. The story follows the life of this young man from his birth to old age and reveals the life of a man who was to impact his country in memorable ways at a critical point in the history of the USA.

The role of Cohan is played by James Cagney and was a rather dramatic departure from the gangster roles with which he had become associated. Cagney, who is a remarkable dancer with a rather unique style, handles the role with power and displays the boundless energy which seemed to characterize Cohan's life.

Cohen's impact on Broadway and the American musical theater was profound and left a legacy from which we can all benefit. His music reflected a confidence in the United States and its future which accurately mirrored the sentiments of the time.

This is an excellent film for the entire family and is one that should not be missed.",1322870400,,994,4.511111111111111

114870,4,0790743442,"And so it begins!  My epic 100 film view/review trek begins with Yankee Doodle Dandy.  As far as musicals go, it is a classic.  Stepping back from the amazing source material and patriotic fervor sweeping the nation at the time it was made, we are left with a solid musical.  Notice I said solid, not perfect.  It is an iconic Cagney film, mostly for the fact that it showed he could do more than play a gangster.  But, there are reasons why Cagney always played a gangster and a thug instead of a dancer and singer.  His singing is average and his dancing steps are... uniquely his (Not a bad thing, but not often replicated).  The film also suffers from some pacing problems and a few of the numbers are weak and seem out of place or just bizarre.  Yes, you can hide behind the fact that it was a biopic, but using the ""based on a true story"" defense is flimsy at best.  The film itself was a patriotic shot in the arm for the 1940s World War Two era and it can be seen by a cynic (I'm nothing if not a cynic) as a two-hour long recruitment film, and I'm sure to some extent it was meant to be.

But, I am being quite harsh on it.  The film itself is one of the great musicals, a lot of the numbers and dances are well put together, and the fact that it was directed by Michael Curtiz is a definite point in its favor.  It showcases both Cagney's range as an actor, and Curtiz's range as a director.  All in all a good film with a few weaknesses and deserving of its place at 98 on AFI's Top 100.",1320192000,,1498,4.085616438356165

This is the movie to see to discover the ""Dancer"" Cagney.  I think he would give Gene Kelly or Donald O'Connor a run for their money any day (I'd have thrown Fred Astaire in too, but his style is different from Kelly or O'Connor or Cagney).  Cagney portrays song writer George M. Cohan from young man to mature man.  When you see the closing scene of the movie, you'll see why I didn't say from young man...to old man.

Born of a vaudeville family, George voices strong opinions even as a young man, about the family's stage performances. The father played by Walter Huston patiently nurtures George, until George is ready to step out on his own.

George M. Cohan was actually born on the Fourth of July, so he cannot help but be patriotic. One can also expect the film to make strong patriotic statements, and it does. It will have every bone in the body humming along to the tunes of Yankee Doodle Dandy, You're a Grand Old Flag, Over There, Mary's a Grand Old Name, and more.

When I was a youth, the actor James Cagney represented the hoodlum element in America cinema. So, when I first saw ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", I could not believe what I was seeing; James Cagney playing a song and dance man? But more thrilling was watching him sing and dance to the choreography of multiple stage performances.

This film must certainly depict James Cagney as he wanted to be known.

It's one of those movies that belong in a time capsule to provide future generations with glimpse of a enthusastic, optismistic America that didn't let anything stand in their way.

I hadn't watched this film for possbily 20 years or more until recently seeing it with my daughter. It's still a classic, make no mistake about that but it does seem a bit dated.

Cagney, who got an Oscar for best actor, does an awesome job as Cohan, playing out his cockiness, drive and multi-talented skills (actor, songwriter, playwright, dancer, singer, producer, director, theater owner and choreographer), and, remember, when you see Cagney dancing this was all before the tech we have today that let's you adjust things without redoing the whole scene.  Dialogue is pleasurably snappy. Actors are top notch.  There's a nice history of the stage in this movie as it begins pre 1900 and goes up to the WWII period.  Speaking of which this movie started just a few days before Pearl Harbor and everyone creating this film decided to make it a super patriotic film.  In 2007 the American Film Institute put this movie in the Top 100 and its well deserved. BTW, if you've never heard of Cohan then you probably know him for several of his songs: ""Over There"", ""Give My Regards To Broadway"", ""Yankee Doodle"", ""You're a Grand Old Flag"" ""Harrigan"" and ""Mary's a Grand Old Name"".  MOST MEMORABLE DIALOGUE: George: Oh, I am proud. In fact, I'm flabbergasted. First time in my life, I'm speechless. Are you sure there isn't some mistake? President: Quite sure. George: (modestly) But this medal is for people who've given their lives to their country or done something big. I'm just a song and dance man. Everybody knows that. President: A man may give his life to his country in many different ways, Mr. Cohan. And quite often he isn't the best judge of how much he has given. Your songs were a symbol of the American spirit. Over There was just as powerful a weapon as any cannon, as any battleship we had in the First World War. Today, we're all soldiers, we're all on the front. We need more songs to express America.

Michael Curtiz directed this fictionalized, unabashedly flag waving biopic of the first actor to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor, George M. Cohan. A delightful musical that covers his boyhood rise in late 19th Century vaudeville to national acclaim in the early 20th. There are recreations from several of George's stage hits, including LITTLE JOHNNY JONES (1904), the first American musical.

Cagney delights with singing and loose-jointed dancing, especially in the title song (from the previously mentioned ""Jones""). He's outstanding in an Oscar-winning turn as the man they erected a statue to on Broadway. Highest recommendation!

114941,5,0790743442,"This 1942 film by director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, Mildred Pierce, Robin Hood, etc) captures a once-in-a-lifetime acting spectacle. It's Cagney's film, pure and simple. It's easy to see how this patriotic film helped America during the war as a morale booster. It is not only highly nostalgic but also very entertaining as a musical... and as a showcase for Jimmy Cagney.

The film received eight Oscar nominations and won three: Best Actor (James Cagney), Best Sound Recording (Nathan Levinson), and Best Scoring of a Musical Picture (Ray Heindorf and Heinz Roemheld). The other five nominations were Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Walter Huston), Best Director, Best Original Story (Robert Buckner), and Best Film Editing (George Amy). Cagney became the first actor to receive an Academy Award for a musical performance (his favorite performance of his career).

Cagney's performance is dynamic and charismatic and charming, a one man show. His dancing is fantastic to behold, and watching him wangle his way into partnership with a playwright and into financial backing from a bewildered producer (arts patron Mr. Schwab, played by S.Z. Sakall of ""All About Eve"", ""Christmas in Connecticut"", etc) is a pleasure.

James Cagney's dancing is almost playful, and it looks truly effortless. No wonder he got an Academy Award; he acts, cries, dances, sings, and does comedy in one film. Not an easy role. And Cagney nearly seems to float, he's so light on his feet, so acrobatic. Plus, he is not only adept at the dancing, but he seems to be having an absolute ball while doing it. You can tell he is 100% in his element.

The songs in this film, that George M. Cohan wrote and made famous, are really an integral part of American culture and its past. ""Give My Regards to Broadway"", ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", and ""Over There""... they hold stirring and heartfelt sentiments and ideas. They came about during the first World War but they still hold a potency of their own. I don't know if most people are familiar with these tunes, but they are important because they roused and united the country . . . as nothing else but music and song can. Sometimes I marvel at the passion and talent of patriotic musicians like John Phillip Sousa and George Cohan.

I love when Cagney breaks into that tap dance as he decends the staircase, towards the end of the movie. That bit was improvised. It's a really nice touch.

Yes, this is a flag-waving and grand old musical . . . larger than life and highly entertaining. It has a strong emotional core (the focus on the Cohan family and their love for each other) and it can easily choke you up, especially the very last scene.",1252281600,3,2668,4.827133479212254

114947,3,0790743442,"There is one problem with watching ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" despite the fact that James Cagney is superb in his underdog sort of role, the title songs and subsequent Americana ditties are toe-tapping from the start, as well as the cinematography and set design are Oscar-worthy - ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is just too long.  Being a newbie to both the world of Cagney as well as American propaganda, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" seemed the best place to start, and from the opening scene of the birth of George M. Cohan (felt like Fincher borrowed this scene for his ""Benjamin Button"" film) on the 4th of July, there was this immediate attachment.  This film was loud, flashy, and when Cohan began telling his life story to the President of the United States, I eagerly anticipated the results.  Then, we leisurely waked through his life.  When using the word ""leisurely"", it is straightforwardly inescapable.  Be prepared for everything from his family's rise and fall to the eventual birth of every song, no stone is left unturned, and while that can be entertaining - it can also dwindle a great movie into mediocrity.  That is what happened to ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", this viewer went from singing the songs during the day to broodingly waiting for it to finally end.  It was like a rollercoaster, it was at the utmost high, but then went shooting straight down once it was unable to find its ending.

""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is not just this never ending story that repetitively builds too much.  It boasts an Oscar-winning performance for Cagney (who later gets type-cast as this ""Public Enemy""), and it delivers.  It boasts these huge, glorious musical numbers, and it arrives with bells on.  It boasts pure, uncut, raw Americana and it nearly makes you want to stand up and sing.  Thus, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" delivers exactly what one may want from a film like this.  There should be no complains, right?  Again, the length of this film began, as the third act blended into the fourth and so on, felt tedious, boring, melodramatic, and lacking focus.  When Cohan finishes his speech with the President, the ending should have been in plain view.  The long walk down the flight of iconic Presidents, it felt winded.  The final shots were just focus-less.  There should have been a fade to black long before that.  On another note, from the beginning, I knew that Cohan was pure America, it was necessary to consistently repeat that idea.  For example, the scene in which he attempts to join the army was ridiculous.  The merit was there, but the essence of the scene was missing.  Sure, Cohan can tap, but does that mean he should brandish a gun?  Another great example of why ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" began so well, but then felt as if we were stuffing the turkey too full - it was beginning to feel ... dare I say, more American...

To complete this discussion, I would like to reiterate again that ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (for the most part) had me tapping my toes and singing right along with the now infamous George M. Cohan.  James Cagney was superb.  His blend of humor, great dance, and exciting dialogue proved that he was more than just his later films.  While this was a semi-ensemble film, each scene that Cagney was in (which was nearly all of them) he stole the scene.  As audience, our eyes were fixated on what this ""average joe"" looking man was about to do next.  Even his dancing seemed original.  Yet, I regretfully admit it was just too long.  The final act just felt flat, and when his conversation with the President ended, it should have faded then - instead the rest of the ""filler"" just felt stale.  I loved this movie, I can suggest it to friends and family, but alas, be prepared for that final moment.  ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" felt like riding a roller coaster too many times, by the end, you just want to get off and savor the fun parts.  By extending it too long, the sloppy ending ruined my savor for this film.  Loved it.  Liked it.  Don't need to watch it again.

114948,5,0790743442,"The stars must have been alligned for ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".  Neither star James Cagney or director Michael Curtiz were known for musical endeavors.  This film has no right to work but darned if it doesn't.  It could have been a time capsule curio made to boost morale of the wartime audience.  But it's unapologetic sunniness and patriotism is timeless and in these troubled times we could sure use more of it.  I'm sure some facts of George M.Cohan's life have been embellished but I don't care.  I won't even dare seek out the ""truth"".  The songs reverberate in your head and will stand the test of time.  Arguably Cagney's best role he projects optimism through sheer willpower.  Cagney's a surprisingly nimble hoofer though I found his vocals lacking, kind of a talking delivery instead of actual singing though Cagney makes you forget this deficiency.  Also good is Walter Huston who plays Cohan's father, Gerry, and he surprises with his song and dance technique.  An unabashed classic.",1239494400,,993,4.921686746987952

114965,5,0790743442,"Wow! What a classic movie this is. It's from a different era and probably seems too schmaltzy and contrived. Still, it is a terrific movie in its own terms.

James Cagney is a credible song and dance man as he plays the great showman George M. Cohan. His dancing down the stairs of the White House still stuns me when I watch. I can see myself falling down the stairs after the first step!

There is a lot of emotional impact to the movie.  The final scene where he is walking down the street with marching troops, readying themselves for leaving for Europe at the outset of America's involvement in World War II. With his own music being played as the troops march. . . .  I still get misty-eyed with that scene.

The story itself is pretty standard. The portrait of Cohan, his family, and his friends as his talent propels him upward in the Broadway galaxy of stars and talents.  There are the ups and downs and challenges that face him in the movie. However, as one might guess, he triumphs.

Cagney does a great job singing the songs and dancing while portraying Cohan. And those songs. . . . Among the ones that Cagney sings: ""Over There,"" ""Harrigan,"" ""Give My Regards to Broadway,"" ""Mary's a Grand Old Name,"" ""You're a Grand Old Flag,"" and so on. And, of course, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" Just a great deal of fun.

The other actors provided great support for Cagney's bravura performance. Walter Huston, Joan Leslie, Richard Whorf, Jeanne Cagney (James' sister), Frances Langford. . . .  All acquit themselves nicely.

There is a second DVD with all manner of supporting material, but I never get as interested in these add-ons as perhaps I should. I much prefer to attend to the ""main event,"" in this case the movie itself.

Anyhow, treat yourself to a classic. . . .  This is an all-time great ""feel good"" movie.",1223510400,,1818,4.542944785276074

It comes with a second disc of very informative documentaries and other special features that add to the enjoyment of this true classic.  The main course has also been digitally restored very well so that I couldn't find any visual imperfections.  The sound quality isn't as great though as the volume levels do become soft at some parts but overall the restorers did a great job.  Like they did with ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" though, I would have prefered a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and THX or DTS audio option to have been included to bring the sound quality at least on par with the video quality.

The acting, especially of Cagney, is first class and although this movie runs for over 2 hours, you don't feel it as I found myself enjoying it without a dull moment from start to finish.  Looking at AFI's list of 100 best films, I'm actually surprised this has placed so low at #100 when it is surely a lot better than many of the entries currently placed above it.

The movie is much different than the hard-hitting biopics of entertainers made today (""Ray,"" ""Walk the Line,"" ""La Vie en Rose"") -- no sex, no drugs, just song and dance, with a small undercurrent of romance, but mostly this is Cagney's show.  It details Cohan's life from birth to old age and spans just over two hours, but the story is so lively it doesn't feel that long.

I first saw it years ago, because it was my grandfather's favorite movie.  I'm so glad he showed it to me, because it's not one of those older movies that is very well-known, like ""Casablanca"" or ""Sunset Boulevard.""

Watch the movie (or listen to the disc) and see what he says is on the record.  Every song is a classic.  If you ever go to Broadway see the George M. Cohan statue, Broadway and 45th I think.

As a wartime valentine to American patriotism, the film was a total success even if the schmaltz is laid on mighty thick but what makes this DVD set so special is the perfect print and the generous extras. Try this for starters:

- a detailed documentary on Cagney presented by Michael Fox full of film clips and including comments from his daughter and Joan Leslie, among others.
- a detailed documentary on the film itself and a commentary to be played with the film by the pleasantly spoken Rudy Behlmer. Behlmer had access to the daily production notes and he tracks the filming in minute detail.
- a superb short film starring Cagney with Ann Sothern but showcasing little Margaret O'Brien. Cagney plays a family man who imagines the effect of an air raid on his daughter if they lived in parts of the world which were being bombed, unlike America. The short is more powerful than any number of war films which came out of Hollywood during this period and O'Brien is extraordinary.
- audio outtakes and rehearsals from the film's soundtrack

115021,5,0790743442,"The movie ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" was an extremely good patriotic movie.  The most important aspect about the movie was that it raises patritoic sentiments toward the United Stats in everyone who observes it.

  The movie is filmed around the life of George M. Cohan.  As a boy he grew up touring the country with his family while performing with them.  During this time, the name of the group was ""The Four Cohans.""  Because of his childhood acting experiences, George Cohan was a bit too confident in his abilities, and as a result, many turned him down.  However, after many trials, he finally got a job and began writing plays.  Although the movie focuses on his carieer, it also shows some about his family such as the death of his father and his marriage to Mary.  In the movie, they show excerpts from many of his plays.  Not only did he write the scripts to thses plays, he also was a main role player and singer in the actual plays.  Many of his plays focused around patriotism.  Some of his most noteable plays are ""Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway,"" ""Little Nellie Kelly,"" ""George Washington Jr.,"" and multiple others.  But in modern days nobody remembers the individual plays, but they remember the famous songs he wrote including, ""You're a Grand Old Flag,"" ""Over There,"" and ""Give My Regards to Broadway,"" and ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.""  George M. Cohan also was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor by President Franklin Roosevelt for his contribution to America with his patriotic songs during the two world wars.

115025,5,0790743442,"Some films should never be remade, they simply are so good they don't need another interpretation. Yankee Doodle Dandy is one of those films. It is the versatile actor, James Cagney's only Oscar- winning performance, and is the standard by which the musical format should be measured. Cagney began his long career in vaudeville and like the main character, George M. Cohan, was Irish-American and a song and dance man. Yankee Doodle Dandy was the most patriotic of WWII films and its flag waving and American ""Over There"" mentality was just the shot in the arm the country needed. Cagney's bigger than life portrayal of Cohan's style of delivery and dancing is not the Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire method of putting over a song, but it is historically correct for the era and artist as well as Cagney himself. If you've never seen the Public Enemy do a buck and wing, this is your opportunity in the extended mid-film production numbers, ""Yankee Doodle/Give My Regards To Broadway."" It is a treat to see the actor transformed into a ballet/tap/ shuffle off to Buffalo dance man that for most audiences is a surprise.

Cohan was one of the most prolific and popular Broadway producer, actor, author, and today, his works are almost never remembered or performed except for this film. Every possible patriotic element is utilized in this wonderful family film. It is just the excuse to make one sing aloud, ""Grand Old Flag"" with the cast of boy scouts, civil war, and revolutionary war extras. Backing Cagney on the stage are his real life sister, Jean Cagney playing Cohan's little sister, Josie, elegant Rosemary de Camp and the brilliant actor, Walter Houston as Cohan ma and pa, and Joan Leslie as his wife.

The choreography and songs are magnificent--the title song, ""Mary's a Grand Old Name,"" `You're a Grand Old Flag"", ""Only 45 Minutes From Broadway,"" ""Give My Regards to Broadway,"" ""Over  There,"" ""In a Kingdom of Our Own,"" ""Nellie Kelly,"" the list is endless and they are all great.  And Cagney is a wonder, a fabulous singer and dancer.  I never wanted this movie to end.

At 126 minutes, it almost doesn't.  But the double disk DVD adds a good two hours to it--a 60 minute biography of James Cagney, a featurette on making the movie, a Cagney trailer gallery, color cartoons satirizing the movie, patriotic shorts and newsreels hosted by Leonard Maltin, publicity material, and the extraordinary short ""You, John Jones"".

I adore YANKEE DOODLE DANDY and play it every July  4th  on home video, except for when it was shown at a Stanford revival theater with a still young and pretty Joan Leslie in person to graciously sign autographs and answer questions at her seat at intermission.  But short of a movie palace showing with the leading lady in person, this double DVD does more than full justice to one of Hollywood's greatest musical biographies.",1152057600,,1772,4.9391891891891895
115030,5,0790743442,"James Cagney recalls in his autobiography that this movie was his favorite, largely due to his love of dancing. He was one of the great ""tough guys"" of all time on film, but dancing was his passion, he noted. It shows here. This was ""a labor of love,"" to use a clich?, and it's obvious how much fun he was having in this film. His hoofing talent also was obvious. He was good, very good.

In fact, for the audience, most of this movie is pure ""feel good."" Almost all the characters are nice people, the story is inspirational and nicely patriotic and the songs are fantastic. If you pick up this two-disc special-edition DVD that came out several years ago, then you'll see this film in all it's glory. The transfer is magnificent and really brings out the great cinematography. I never realized how beautifully filmed this was until I saw this on DVD.

The story is simply the biography of George M. Cohan, the writer and Broadway star of many, many hit plays and hit songs. Unlike today's biographies, this is a very positive story about a man who brought patriotism alive during World War I with such inspirational songs as ""It's A Grand Old Flag"" and ""Over There."" For some of us, listening to these songs can bring a tear or two.

Cagney is his normal riveting self and Joan Leslie certainly makes an appealing female lead as Cohan's wife. The great Walter Huston plays Cohan's father. I've always found Huston to be an actor of great presence. In this movie is a very, very touching deathbed scene with he and Cagney.

So you have a little bit of everything here from drama to romance to comedy to music and Cagney is the glue to fits it all together beautifully. One of the great classic films of all time.",1145664000,10,1713,4.480769230769231
115041,4,0790743442,"Yankee Doodle Dandy is the story of the life of Broadway legend George M. Cohan. The film takes us in flashback to his beginning as a cocky kid in ""Peck's Bad Boy"" to the time when he strikes it lucky and gets his first major hit to his later life. The film is long, but it is a showcase for musical number after musical number. Because Cohan himself influenced the film, the information is not all true; Cohan was NOT born on the 4th of July. However, it works for the film because the story is told through the eyes of the elderly Cohan.

James Cagney plays Cohan with ease and brilliance. His cockiness translates in his adept dancing and speak-singing which are done similarly to Cohan's true style. The man is brash and funny, a delight to watch.

The three major shows, ""Little Johnny Jones,"" ""45 Minutes From Broadway,"" and ""George Washington Jr.,"" are extravagant and fun but each of them actually could have been done on a stage. This is in great contrast to the impossible musical numbers of Busby Berkley.

This special edition DVD contains an extra disk of bonus treasures. First, there is a documentary about Cagney's life narrated by Michael J. Fox. It features rare photographs, clips from films like Sinners Holiday, The Public Enemy, Taxi, Lady Killer, Footlight Parade, Here Comes The Navy, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Something to Sing About, Angels With Dirty Faces, The Oklahoma Kid, Yankee Doodle Dandy, The Time Of Your Life, White Heat, Mister Roberts, The Seven Little Foys, and One Two Three. Several people are interviewed including Mae Clark, Virginia Mayo, Brigid O'Brien, Casey Cagney Thomas, Joan Leslie, and Jack Lemmon. The documentary is decent but nothing outstanding; however, I have not seen another about Cagney.

There is also a documentary detailing the making of Yankee Doodle Dandy. It outlines George M. Cohan's life and transitions into making the film. It is very good and interesting to watch.

One of the cutest parts of the extra features is called ""John Travolta Remembers James Cagney."" It is a short clip that describes how Travolta came to meet and befriend Cagney in the last five years of his life and why he wanted to meet him. It is highly enjoyable and sweet.",1139616000,8,2215,4.787958115183246
115042,5,0790743442,"It's got energy to spare, and Cagney is a dynamo as the song and dance man George M. Cohan. The ending is heavy on the flag-waving, but after all it was 1942 and the war was on. There are other overly sentimental scenes, but in this biographical movie that is more the fault of Cohan than it is of the picture.

Cagney can't sing worth a lick, but he can dance, even if he does look like Rocco doing a buck and wing. His presence on the screen is like a tornado on a Kansas landscape. Walter Huston is a real standout as Cohan's father. The direction is tight and constantly moves the story forward - it doesn't lag for a second. It's one of the best up-beat movies ever made. I remember it being show frequently on TV (at least in the NYC area) during the 1950s-60s, and everytime I watched it, it knocked me out. (I loved trying to duplicate Cagney's dance bit that he does on the walls, to my mother's great annoyance.) Definitely worth a watch.",1131062400,4,948,4.266666666666667

115063,4,0790743442,"Jimmy Cagney does it all in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, the exuberant biography of patriotic song-and-dance man George M. Cohan.  I don't know much about Cohan beyond what I've learned from the film and Rudy Behlmer's commentary and I don't trust that the movie was aiming at a wart's-and-all portrayal, or much cared about historical accuracy.  According to Behlmer Cohan had been married twice and neither wife was named Mary, although sweet Joan Leslie plays Mary Cohan, the film Cohan's one and only wife.  Hollywood's Golden Age bio-pics didn't often stop for the facts, so I guess you can't fault this one for twisting things to fit the story.  Cohan wrote the hit `Mary's A Grand Old Name,' Behlmer tells us, for his daughter.  It fit the movie that Cagney/Cohan wrote it for his then fiance.

 Cagney won an Oscar for his role in this movie and he pretty much owns the show.  His pleasure is evident in every frame and it's hard not to get caught up in his enthusiasm.  For anyone (like me) who's used to Cagney as a gun-toting gangster YANKEE DOODLE DANDY will come as something of a revelation.  Jimmy can sing (well, he sings no worse than Fred Astaire, anyway) and he can dance.  The highlight of the movie for me were the vaudeville routines and the many production numbers, including `You're a Grand Old Flag,' `Give My Regards to Broadway,' the anthem of World War I `Over There,' and, of course, `The Yankee Doodle Boy.' YANKEE DOODLE DANDY was just beginning filming when Pearl Harbor was attacked, which may account for some of its strong-to-overpowering patriotism.  Still, watching Cagney tap dance down the White House stairs is a treat not to be missed.  Surprisingly, this one's in black-in-white, a format I usually prefer, but if ever a movie begged for a red, white, and blue presentation it's YANKEE DOODLE DANDY.

 Behlmer's commentary is heavy on the history of the production of the movie, detouring now and then to add tidbits on Cohan's life and career.  It's a pleasant enough approach most of the time, but there's a little too much information on what scene was shot on what day.  The two documentaries on disk two - ""James Cagney: Top of the World"" and ""Let Freedom Sing! The Story of Yankee Doodle Dandy"" are satisfying introductions to the star and the movie (the Cagney documentary is hosted by actor Michael J. Fox).  The disks have plenty of other extras, as well.  An interesting 1943 short ""You, John Jones"" starring Cagney as a volunteer air raid warden over here, three classic Warner cartoons, newsreels, etc.  As usual with the Warner Home Video release I found the extras pertinent to the feature and most welcome.  A strong recommendation for this two-disk set.",1122768000,39,2703,4.782327586206897
115064,5,0790743442,"What a classic line from an American film. This movie chronicles the life story of George M. Cohan, who was a proud Irish-American. He worked for years with his family on the vaudeville circuit primarily in the north-east portion of the United States. James Cagney played the lead role of George M. Cohan. Just as Mr. Cohan was an American Icon, so was James Cagney. I never saw the ""real"" George M. Conhan, but James Cagney was BRILLIANT in this film. All of the songs throughout the film were written by George M. Cohan.

This movie is the story of a very patriotic man, and for you to enjoy this film you should be the type of person that loves the flag of the USA, and who believes in patriotism. Otherwise, you will be bored out of your mind. If on the other hand, (as I am) you are one of those flag-waving, American-loving, eyes well with tears during the Star Spangled Banner types, then you will LOVE this movie.",1120348800,2,921,4.41764705882353

115066,5,0790743442,"Cory Harper,

Let's do a simple recap to help your feeble Canadian mind understand the ways of the world......

1) Al Qaeda attacked and seeks to destroy America.

2) The whole world believed Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.

3) According to Iraqi intelligence reports obtained after the Iraq war, Bin Laden had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Syria as early as 1992. This confirmed America's inteligence.

4) Therefore, the possibility existed that weapons of mass destruction could end up in the hands of those who seek to destroy America. After 9/11 it was a risk we were no longer willing to take.

NOW do you understand why America invaded the ""innocent"" country of Iraq? Standing up to your enemies and kicking their arses is definitely what America is about nowadays and in days past.

And yes Yankee Doodle Dandy is a great film.",1115424000,3,853,4.841379310344828
115067,5,0790743442,"Oh what an out-and-out joy is this film!

As you know by now, the amazing James Cagney sings, dances and acts his way through this rousing biopic of George M. Cohan. He's directed by Michael Curtiz, a director who apparently could work in any genre of movie, and produce masterpieces. Pull up his name on imdb and you'll see what I mean.

Anyways, the film traces his life from his infant vaudevillian beginnings to his conquering of Broadway. After seeing this, you'll know why there's a statue of Cohan in Times Square.

The acting, as expected, is top-notch, with the sweet Joan Leslie as his love interest Mary, Walter Huston as his dad; Cagney's sister plays Cagney's sister...but what will bring you to see this movie again and again are the musical interludes.

Cagney is simply spectacular. He is a comet, bouncing around the Broadway stage. His dancing often flirts with straight-out levitation. I swear there are times when his feet fly across the screen...

Then consider the songs...""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", ""Mary"", ""Give My Regards to Broadway"" and the most patriotic song I've ever heard, ""Over There.""

That song was written for the troops of WW I, and this film was being made when Pearl Harbor was attacked. The way this one song is used in this film, I guarantee, will stay with you forever. And knowing that this movie was made during that time only enhances your experience...but I didn't know it until afterwards, and it made no difference.

And that leads to the one thing I feel is overlooked in most reviews of this film: the script. It's has a strong story, great lines, terrific set-pieces and delightful twists. It's funny as all-get-out, and heart-wrenching when you least expect it.

The movie is as American as can be...the rags-to-riches rise of the central figure in Broadway history (the Broadway musical being essentially an American creation), the way his family travels to all the new states as they are incorporated...the evolution of New York City...WW I...WW II...it's all here!

And from beginning to end, Cohan (and the filmmakers) wear their ""Grand Old Flag"" on their proverbial sleeves, proudly and unabashedly. Patriotism is a definite theme througout the film, rising to dizzying heights right before the credits. Patriotism portrayed simply and honestly, without any hard political bent or satirical edge.

The DVD, one of those sweet Warner 2-disc sets, is exemplary...great transfer, nice extras...bravo Warner, again, for treating your classics with respect.

It's inarguable: this is one of the great films of all time. I envy those of you about to see it for the first time, and I assure you it won't be your last!",1106611200,181,2663,4.948430493273543

Wish I could add about 2 more ** stars to the the box. - I had also forgotten that Cagney played the role of George M.  - What a fantastic actor he was.  The black and white did not bother me.  One reviewer said that if Turner had wanted a color version he should do a remake. True, but I think Hollywood would be hard-pressed today to find a Cohan to equal Cagney.  Bette Midler - maybe, but then Cohan was GEORGE and not Georgette - ;)  Agree totally that this is one of these films that the entire family can watch again and again without fear of hearing vulgar language or seeing violence in every other scene.",1097625600,4,693,4.141791044776119

I have been sickened by the partisan fighting in this country (we were ATTACKED; whatever happened to rallying together as Americans behind a president who is trying to ensure it never happens again?), not to mention the anti-Americanism abroad. (My husband and I visited France four times in the 1980's and 1990's; I will never step foot in that country again.)

This movie is somewhat of a tonic, for me, to all that is going on. I need its pride, I need its patriotic songs, I need to see Mr. Cohan unabashedly proclaiming his love for country. ""You're a grand old flag,"" yes indeed you are. And ""The Yanks ARE coming,"" and we ARE ""over there,"" thanks to a president who is wise enough to understand that we must be on the offensive since 9/11.

I've not seen the colorized version, but the black and white is so appropriate to its time, I'm satisfied with the movie as it.
As many reviewers have mentioned, James Cagney is so perfect in this role, you can't imagine anyone else in it!  He always considered himself a song-and-dance man, though you wouldn't know it if you were a fan of his many gangster flicks.  Fred Astaire turned down the role, if you believe the many stories.  And, as much as I love Astaire, the film would have suffered for it.  The manic energy Cagney displays in the highlight musical numbers just brings his role to perfection.
If you are looking for a classic, never-to-be-topped movie about a songwriter, Broadway, great, rousing music, 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' is your film.

It's still pretty cornball in its approach to American patriotism and fervour, and with the American government currently bullying its way around the world, the ""let's be proud we're all Americans"" broo-hah-hah on display in the film is even harder to digest.  But don't avoid this movie if those are your only reservations about it.
""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" has an energetic drive to it that many films lack.  The 125-minute running time flies by, and the film is never once boring.  This energy is due almost entirely to one thing: James Cagney.
Cagney tears into the role of George M. Cohan with everything he's got, and just try taking your eyes off of him whenever he's on screen.  He can't sing at all, and he's really more of an acrobat than a dancer, but he pulls off the role of a Broadway showman effortlessly.
The rah-rah American sentiments are obviously a product of the time, and little more than World War II propaganda at moments, but I could swallow them easier in this film for some reason.  Maybe because when they're at their most intrusive (the ""Grand Old Flag"" number, for instance), the spectacle is so rousing that I would have been just as moved if they'd been singing about cheese and crackers.
A deservedly beloved American classic.

You got it; ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".  Personally, I would have ranked it higher but I was glad to see it on the list because I was afraid it might have gradually become forgotten.  That would be a shame because this is a well-made movie that's a lot of fun.  It's a real rah rah, rally-round-the-flag movie and it came out at just the right time; 1942.  It tells the story of Gearge M. Cohan who was a real rah rah, rally-round-the-flag kind of a guy.  It fits into the classification of a musical although it is much deeper than that.
The greatness of this movie is measured by its' cast with the primary focus going to James Cagney.  Cagney is better known for his tough-guy ganster movies but he was an all around entertainer in this movie.  His singing is adequate for the job and his dancing is very very good.  He's a bit stiff legged at times but the choreography seems to play to that aspect.  It's his acting that raises this movie above the level of the standard musical of that era.  Cagney is a fast-talking, wheeler-dealer who thrives on the spotlight.  He seems to be a better Cohan than George M. himself.  This was Cagney's Oscar-winning performance and a well-deserved award it was.
If the movie has a short-coming, it's in the portrayal of his marriage.  Joan Leslie plays his wife in the movie and does a good job in that role.  However, the screenwriters left out any scenes that embellish their relationship beyond that of stage partners.  The absence of children and their formal manner of communication left some wondering why they tied the knot.  However, the pace of this movie leaves little time to ponder such things.  Watch this movie and you'll feel like marching in a parade.  It's a real feel-good movie made back in the days when Hollywood knew how to make them.",1067212800,7,1935,4.53757225433526

James Cagney plays George Cohan, and gives one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. He won the Oscar that year for best actor. He sings and dances to classic tunes such as ""Give my Regards to Broadway,"" ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" and ""Your a Grand Old Flag.""

Though he is proud of himself and his accomplishments, we see in Cohan someone who had great success but also learned from his bumps, bruises, and mistakes. It is a Hollywood extravaganza. There are song and dance numbers, a large all star cast, and it is pure pleasure all the way. The factor that makes the film so special is James Cagney in the role of Cohan. Perhaps because he plays the bad guy so often, we are surprised to see him singing and dancing as a nice guy. Many believe that this role was his best and shows his versatility as an actor. I could not agree more.
The movie has historic value. It was released in the early years of World War II, at a time when Americans were confident but unsure as to what would happen in the war. Movies such as YANKEE DOODLE DANDY stirred patriotism at such a critical moment in our history.

This movie has everything; a great story (perhaps not entirely historically accurate, but hey, this is Hollywood)great dancing/singing and a great cast...It is hard, when given such a plethora of fabulous talent, to isolate one particular scene; nevertheless, here are a few of my favorites: When George meets Mary backstage (this is a riot) for the first time; when George does the dance number that includes literally walking up a wall(!)(Cagney was very limber, to say the least; this move would give Nijinski pause) and the Busby Berkley style Flag number; almost makes you want to enlist! There is a great scene toward the end when Cohan is relaxing on his country farm and some teenagers happen by; they are given a brief lesson in Hollywood newswriting; Cohan has a copy of Variety with the headline ""Stix Nix Hix Pix"" whic he translates for their edification (and fascination) and they are enthralled. And my favorite of all, at the end, the scene in the White House, where ""an ordinary guy"" gets an audience with the President of the United States and dances happily down the White House stairs, to the quiet delight of the staff...to the makers of the film, the actors and the ""real"" players, I say: ""My father thanks you, my mother thanks you, and I thank you..."" for such a great piece of Americana.
**NOTE: It is a tragedy that James Cagney and his wife wound up with such a treacherous woman at the end of their lives; she virtually isolated them from their family, doctors, lawyers and friends and took complete, total control of their house and their finances...too bad Cagney couldn't have mustered up one last grapefruit in the face scene. There was a huge spread in Life magazine and it told a harrowing story of the notorious one-time waitress who befriended the Cagneys, insinuated herself into their lives and took terrible advantage of them...a story that defies even Hollywood to tell.",1063065600,,1931,4.819277108433735

115091,5,0790743442,"YANKEE DOODLE DANDY was released just before the legendary George M. Cohan died from cancer. It was a patriotic movie made during the first year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. The movie was also a musical with lots of singing and dancing - especially by James Cagney. YANKEE DOODLE DANDY should be respected mostly for its music and dancing and not for its story which was about the life of Cohan. Nobody ever credited the film with much accuracy - including Cohan himself.
Cagney considered his role as Cohan to be one of his favorites. It should have been since Cagney began his own show business career as a young hoofer in New York City.
The supporting cast of Walter Huston, Joan Leslie, Irene Manning and Rosemary DeCamp was very strong. Cagney's sister Jeanne played the part of Josie Cohan and Frances Langford appeared as a singer. Eddie Foy Jr. made a brief showing as his own real life father, Eddie Foy.
YANKEE DOODLE DANDY won Academy Awards for Best Actor (James Cagney), Scoring of a Musical Picture and Sound Recording. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Director (Michael Curtiz), Supporting Actor (Walter Huston), Original Story and Editing. The main competition for Oscars in 1942 came from MRS. MINIVER. Director Michael Curtiz won an Academy Award for CASABLANCA in 1943.",1057363200,5,1325,4.841409691629956

Remember when then had to load up a bad movie with starts in hopes it would help sell the movie.  This one is loaded, but the movie and music are wonderful.

115093,4,0790743442,"Only 1942 Hollywood could show an aging songwriter stepping in with a parade and being challenged to sing a patriotic song which he wrote. And George M. Cohan wrote quite a few.
James Cagney's Best Actor performance takes place in flashback in the White House as he is summoned to receive a Medal of Honor for his body of work. He tells his bio to President Franklin Roosevelt, whom he is portraying in his show, ""I'd Rather Be Right.""
Cohan describes his early life in Vaudeville, travelling America with his parents and sister, and how he matures and partners with producer Sam Harris. His ups, downs and true loves weave the well-explained circumstances of many of his 80 plays and 500 hit songs. In particular, ""I'm A Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" ""Give My Regards To Broadway,"" ""Mary,"" ""You're A Grand Old Flag,"" and of course, the rousing WWI anthem, ""Over There.""
Although Cagney's character is a bit glib and constantly wisecracking, his relationships with family, business associates and competitors are well-defined. And of course, his superb dancing and physical movement may come as a surprise to gangster-movie purists. This is particularly evident in a scene he admittedly ad-libbed near the film's end.
Perhaps with America again at war, a classic film like ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" is just what we need to enjoy.",1054684800,12,1317,4.963800904977376

I have a B&W VHS and a colorized VHS (sorry, it really is neat to see it that way) and am anxious to get higher quality with a DVD...when it comes out.",1049846400,,483,4.148936170212766

If any of you are acustom to the old days of Radio City Music Hall during the days of the Movie/Stage Show format, watching these production number will give you found reminders of those Radio City Days. Not only is this the best James Cagney movie, in my opion, it is also the most Red, White and Blue all American movie ever made. This is the all-time feel good movie and the production number ""Give my Regards to Broadway"" is the best show stopping number ever performed by James Cagney. Just wish someone who put this on DVD and rechannel the sound to 5.1 but please keep it in Black & White.",1029024000,,738,4.3478260869565215
115097,5,0790743442,"Although he will always be well known for his gangster roles, James Cagney's only Academy Award for Best Actor came for his role as George M. Cohan, the hoofer, singer, dancer, actor and playwright portrayed in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"". One might suspect that Cagney only won the Oscar because the Academy would never have given it to one of his gangster roles. Or maybe, it was because this film was just what the country needed in the early days of World War II. Or maybe, the academy actually was recognizing Cagney's abilities as an actor. Whatever the reason, Jimmy deserved the award. Who ever knew he could do that kind of footwork and even sing!
Now, let's get to George Cohan, who's ""A good friend of my Uncle Sam"" and was ""Born on the Fourth of July"". Because of this, Cohan was immensely patriotic and wrote many flag waving tunes. Many of you are still stumped about his name, but you would probably know his songs if you heard them: ""Mary"", ""Give My Regards to Broadway"", ""Harrigan"", ""45 Minutes from Broadway"", ""Over There"" and, of course, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".
The music numbers, since they are stage productions, lack the Hollywoodized touch that's in ""Singin' in the Rain"". Nevertheless, they are still exciting enough. A great supporting cast assists Cagney, including Walter Huston, Joan Leslie, Richard Whorf, Irene Manning, George Tobias, Rosemary De Camp, Eddie Foy Jr. and Jeanne Cagney (His own sister!). The film's direction was helmed by Michael Curtiz, responsible for such classics as ""Casablanca"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and Cagney in ""Angels With Dirty Faces"". Curtiz puts into the movie his traditional blend of thrills and fast pace. The screenplay is full of memorable scenes and dialogue, particularly ""My mother thanks you, my father thanks you, my sister thanks you and I thank you"". About the only problems with it are moments of melodrama and how it might trivialize some of the events in Cohan's life. I also did not like how the script skips in telling us how Cohan's mother and sister died. But, with all the virtues of the movie, these problems are minor. It also shows to never learn your history from movies.
The version I watched ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" on was the controversial colorized edition created in the late 1980's, one of several movies that received such treatment. The movie doesn't look too bad in color. It's one of a very few movies that can be switched between either version. Nevertheless, if Ted Turner really wanted to see a black and white movie in color, he should have made a remake. Either that or he should have had the cooperation of someone who was involved in the making of the movie. Don't tamper with someone else's work unless you have their discrete!
So, if you happen to see this available for rent or sale at your local video store, don't hesitate (Unless it's in color, that is). Unlike many movies today, this is one you can watch problem free with the whole family.",1017619200,14,2950,4.786274509803921
115098,5,0790743442,"""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" tells the story of Broadway composer George M. Cohan, expertly put over by erstwhile gangster, James Cagney. Cagney had started his show biz career as a hoofer, but later got pegged as a ""public-enemy"" type, so it probably shocked some of his 1940s audience to see him take to his feet and skip effortlessly across the stage in this remarkable biopic.
The story opens with the elderly but still dancing Cohan's getting summoned to the White House on a mysterious visit. President Franklin Roosevelt greets the entertainer and asks him about his life, and then we're off to the land of flashback, as we see George and his parents (dad is Walter Houston) and sis play vaudeville, and then see George strike out on his own as a multitalented composer/performer. And in case you're clueless as to just what Cohan penned, here's just a few: ""Give Me Regards to Broadway"", ""You're a Grand Old Flag"", ""Over There"", ""Mary is a Grand Old Name"", ""Harrigan"", ""Forty-five Minutes from Broadway"", ""So Long Mary"", and the eponymous ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".
Cagney is aces as Cohan, giving us a spunky likeable main character who just happens to dance up a storm at the drop of a hat. I once heard a dancer on TV call Cagney's style ""eccentric dancing"", a style where the upper body remains straight while the performer hops about on his toes. Whatever it is, it is wonderful to watch. The supporting actors and actresses are all good, but the movie is Cagney's by a mile. If you thought all he could do was plug another bootlegger, you've got another thing coming in this deservedly Academy-Award winning performance.",1014508800,,1623,4.8
