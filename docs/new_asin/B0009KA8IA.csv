2298673,3,B0009KA8IA,"Ok, I bought this after reading the reviews.  I was going to get the Pilates Core Power: abdominals and back, but after reading the reviews that that was included in Total Body Training Pilates, I ordered that one instead.  I find only one workout on this video and most of it uses the resist-a-ring.  While this seems to be a fine workout, it NO LONGER has the bonus workout, so don't get it for that.",1264377600,5,402,4.333333333333333
2298674,2,B0009KA8IA,"This is a great video and very useful. When you master these exercises, it will be your day! But unless you are two strokes from being a fitness freak, try something else.

I bought this for my wife and she likes the intensity but after about three times, the interest was lost largely due to the fact that you MUST have the squeeze thingy. Yes you can do the workout without it but it's pretty senseless to do that.

And then you get the squeezy thingy and you realise this is advanced stuff! Really hard so if you like intense workout and you know you gonna stick at it ... this is the right item for you. If you gonna quit easy for something less stressful, please avoid like the plague!",1239667200,3,690,4.259541984732825
2298675,5,B0009KA8IA,"I have tried two of Karen's pilates workouts so far and love both of them.  This routine is excellent for toning abs, thighs, and buttocks.  Her stretching exercises balance the routine off and help achieve that long lean body of a dancer.  I have knee problems and find many common thigh and butt exercises to be too harsh on my knees.  With the help of the resist-a-ring in this routine my knees are not bothered at all.  In fact, I find the muscles surrounding the knee have been strengthened and my knee pain has been decreased.  The only thing I would suggest is to watch out on the push-up section.  If you have knee issues the straight body method is better, or try doing the same exercise but standing and pushing off against a wall.  The resist-a-ring used in this routine is easy to find.  It can be bought on Karen's website, Amazon, or even at Walmart.",1229472000,13,864,4.452229299363057
2298676,5,B0009KA8IA,"Just wanted to confirm that as another reviewer already stated, this DVD does in fact have TWO of Karen's Pilates workouts -- ""Total Body Training"" and ""Abdominals and Back.""  The DVD case did not indicate this, but I popped the DVD in and sure enough, both workouts were there.  That makes this DVD a great bargain.  ""Total Body Training"" uses a resist-a-ring and is an amazing workout for your inner thighs.  But I was most excited that ""Abdominals and Back"" was also included... it is the best ab video I have ever done.  It really works your core but in such a calm, fluid, graceful way.  It's tough but a pleasure to do, much more so than plain old crunches (which I loathe).  Karen is a top-notch instructor, very clear and detailed and with a calm and soothing presence.  Her form is impeccable and her physique is inspiring.  I highly recommend this video if you like Pilates-based core work.",1193702400,14,900,4.610062893081761
2298677,4,B0009KA8IA,"This DVD has several prior names, including ""Pilates Total Body Training"" and ""Body Reform Total Body Training.""  I'm guessing that ""Pilates was removed from the title because it is not a traditional Pilates workout--at most, there are some Pilates-inspired moves, and the Pilates fitness circle is used. Also, although the title refers to ""Total Body Training,"" this workout focuses mainly on the lower body (more specifically, the inner thighs0, and has only minimal upper body work thrown in. A final note is that a fitness circle/resist-a-ring is definitely necessary to the workout; although it is not used for every exercise, when it is used, it is vital for make the movements more focused and TOUGH.

All that being said, this is a challenging workout for the lower body. It begins with a brief warmup to lengthen and stretch the muscles and then moves on to some beginning inner thigh moves combined with concentrated abs work. Although the latter consists mainly of traditional crunches, the resist-a-ring is incorporated to make the moves more unique and more targeted.

The next section comprises the heart of the workout and mainly targets the thighs. The exercises are are done lying on the side and using the resist-a-ring to specifically focus on the inner thighs. The moves are small but tough, with a high number of repetitions at an increasingly quickened pace. Following the thigh work, it's onto the hands and knees (without the ring) for some tough buttocks moves, and then the entire thigh-buttocks sequence is repeated on the other side. Then, just when you think you can't take any more, there are several sets of pushups plus some plank moves for the abs. Finally, the workout ends with a brief stretching segment.

At 50 minutes, this workout is a definite challenge to your strength and endurance. I know that I will continue to challenge myself with this workout and that the results WILL be worth it.",1155081600,11,1930,4.96594427244582
2298678,4,B0009KA8IA,"As above reviewer described, this ""Total Body Training Pilates"" is the same as ""Karen Voight - Total Body Pilates"" but wtih quite cheaper price. I don't see any description on the case or even on the DVD, but when I put the disc in the player, I saw in the menu that this ""Total Body Training"" has two workouts, one for Total Body Training with resistant ring (~50 min.) and Abdominals & Back workout on the mat(~50 min.). There is also a bonus section how to use the ring (~8 minutes). The ring is a good alternative to the ball but less sapcious in my tiny bedroom.

If you don't have previous version and wondering which one to choose, I recommed this one as this is cheaper. You can also get the ring here at amazon, mine is ""Bally Pilates Super Ring"" under $10. I really enjoy the ring workout, very effective and great for thights. Her cue is also good.

The reason I took a star off is that Karen is wearing headset, annoying to look at her while working out. This reminds me of the telesales persons. Also, the music is quite noisy for me. But $8.99 for two good 50 minutes workouts, you can't go wrong, especially for your thights, abs, and backs.

PS. Be careful for reissued older tapes: Kathy Smith signed up with Giaiam and will reissue (May 2006) ""Lift the weights to loose weight"" with cheaper price available at amazon. Karen Voight has a lot of old tapes reissued with slightly different titiles. In this disc, ring workout has higher quality than abs & back workout.

Update: Karen Voight has another title: ""Pilates Core Power - Abdominals & Back"" (ASIN: B00067HP0U ), which is exactly the same as  Abdominals & Back workout on the mat(~50 min.)from this DVD. Save your money not to buy all her workouts by reading fine prints. She has many the same workouts in different titles. Very confusing.",1142812800,52,1814,4.5182926829268295
2298679,1,B0009KA8IA,"The title of this DVD is actually Total Body Training PILATES.  It appears to be a reissue of a 2002 video.  (I really hate it when companies re-issue exercise videos without properly identifying them as such.) The Amazon description does not mention that you need a ""resist-a-ring"" and that it's a PILATES routine--a big omission if you're not interested in pilates!",1124236800,32,367,5.0
8062679,5,B0009KA8IA,"I am embarrassed to admit I had this workout on VHS (lol) when it first came out... I loved it back then but obviously my video player went the way of the dinosaur.  Well, I now have some arthritis damage in my knees and I needed something to quite literally kick my butt that did not involve squats or lunges.  I remembered this workout and came on to see if I could still find it on DVD.  I'm happy to say it is just as brutal as I remember it.  I am sore all over today.  I LOVE Karen Voight, her cuing is superb, her exercises are brutal but effective. Her voice is oddly soothing.  I may have to recreate my old Karen collection.",1485043200,3,634,4.07258064516129

8062681,1,B0009KA8IA,It would not work. Had to return it. A disappointment for me. I love all of my other CD's I have purchased . She has a excellent work out... Thought this one would be good too..,1471478400,,177,3.9444444444444446

8062683,4,B0009KA8IA,"It's a very effective workout, but only for those who can multitask. What I'm referring to is the loud music competing with Karen's instructions for my attention. When I'm concentrating on exercise I don't want to be assaulted by noise that bears no relation to the exercise. I wouldn't mind so much if the music were softer or if it were somehow choreographed to the exercise movements, but it is loud and random. My guess is that the music is included for those people who are used to loud noise in the background while doing other things. I'm not one of them. If the manufacturer could produce a DVD that would give me the option of shutting off the music, I would buy it in a heartbeat.",1443398400,,690,4.440944881889764
8062684,4,B0009KA8IA,"I really enjoy Karen Voight's instructional videos because she provides clear, concise instructions.  She makes suggestions for all the moves and I have never injured myself after a workout.  I know muscles are being developed because I do feel some soreness the day following her workouts.  That being said, this particular video is not a ""total"" body training as it suggests, but a ""lower"" body workout with some ab routines.  I enjoyed the workout and felt that my my inner thighs were given proper attention (something lacking in a lot of other videos).  Luckily I purchased the pilates ring at around the same time, solely because of the DVD jacket picture.

Overall, I am very happy with this purchase; it is a great addition to my workout library.",1427414400,3,754,4.8515625
8062685,5,B0009KA8IA,"I've done both workouts on this DVD, and wow. The workout with the ring works your inner thighs and buns to the limit. There is a lot of repetition on one side that then goes over to the other side (other commenters have mentioned this) at a pace I wasn't used to at first. But once I got used to Karen's style, whoa, the day-after burn was amazing.  The core workout is killer! Karen does do what I think are more advanced moves from Pilates, but she does mention some ways to modify. The One Hundred, tho? I do recommend that you make sure your back is strong enough to handle it; you CAN lie on your back and do it, and it's still a huge workout for your abs and core.

Excellent DVD, I love it!",1363996800,5,698,4.087591240875913
8062686,5,B0009KA8IA,"I wouldn't say this is a total body workout but works great for your inner/outter thighs as well as buns!  I'll use this DVD in my weekly rotation.  After the first time doing this DVD, my legs felt like jello!  ;)",1360713600,2,214,4.170731707317073
8062687,5,B0009KA8IA,"Karen Voight is an excellent instructor!

She really cares in helping others become healthier.
Does not overwork you, just enough to accomplish fine results.",1349654400,,157,5.541666666666667
8062688,5,B0009KA8IA,"I got this DVD several years ago with the two workout.  The pilates with the ring teach you how to breath and squeeze your abdominal in, to obtain optimal results, but also is excellent for the inner thigt. If you are new in the beginning is hard but as Karen Voight said be patient and do it again until you develop strength to reach the results that you are looking for.

The back and abdominal workout is excellent if you have pain in the middle back help you to overcome the pain and I believe give some healing in the muscle at least that happen to me years ago. The workout is not for beginners, but is not advance either.

Now I am buying my second DVD because the old one is getting wore out. At the present, I use it in my easy day, before was one of my hard ones.",1313280000,4,773,4.072368421052632
