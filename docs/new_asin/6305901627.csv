1086524,4,6305901627,"I've read the reviews the others before me have written, and I'm a little surprised that no one else has commented on the similarity between the film ""All the Little Animals"" and the book ""The Little Prince"".  Both the opening and closing shots, and several scenes in between, visually reminded me of ""The Little Prince"", which is my favorite book of all time.  Although the subject matter itself is not very similar, the main characters have strikingly similar childlike characteristics, and there is even an appearance in the film by a fox (and two beautiful scenes in wheat fields).
""All the Little Animals"" is not my favorite film of the independent/arthouse/foreign film genre (that honor goes to ""Lawn Dogs""), but it does have excellent direction, wonderful acting, and quality writing.  As some others have mentioned, the ending is somewhat incongruous, but I think this symbolizes the breaking free of the main character from the prison of mental fuzziness and immaturity that formerly entrapped him.
If you are looking for symbolism, look not for clues in the speeches but in the cinematography and direction.",977875200,4,1118,5.098360655737705
1086525,2,6305901627,"I have to say I was looking so foward to seeing this film.  The concept is wonderful.  It's too bad the last 15 minutes are about the worst ending I have ever seen.  A pleasant story of two lost souls with a common love of animals and the natural world.  Suddenly it turns into some gangster horror flick.  Complete with car chases, kidnapping and blood.  It's as if this ridiculous ending mocks the entire film.  As someone who deeply identified with both Bobby and Mr. Summers it was an outrage that this story would take this sensational, unbelievable turn.",976924800,4,560,4.595959595959596
1086526,5,6305901627,"This film is visually stunning and a must see for animal lovers.  It seems  to be presented through Bobby's eyes which makes it refreshingly innocent  and very honest. I attribute any fairytale-like moments to be the way Bobby  really saw them in his childish way.  It is a movie the likes of which I  don't see very often.  It makes no attempts to please it's audience by  adding stupid things to the plot in an effort to make it more exciting.  Christian Bale is amazing and unbelievably convincing.  The fact that he  does not overplay Bobby's disability as many actors would, adds to the  brilliance of this piece.",965952000,20,618,4.62037037037037
1086527,3,6305901627,"Bobby has ""not been well"" since a childhood car accident and has recently suffered the loss of his mother, leaving him in the charge of his evil stepfather, ""The Fat"". Faced with the choice of signing over  the family department store to ""The Fat"" (against his mother's  dying wishes), or being consigned to ""a special hospital"", Bobby  flees to Cornwall and hooks up with the reclusive misanthrope, Mr Summers.  Helping Summers with his ""work"", tending to ""all the little  animals"", Bobby's world is idyllic, but the prospect of a reunion with  ""The Fat"" always looms ominously on the horizon. Thoroughly  British in concept and execution, ""All the Little Animals"" is a  rewarding adult fairytale, with a refreshing air of romanticism. Christian  Bale, as Bobby, demands affection and John Hurt, as Summers, is at his  eccentric best. A malevolent Daniel Benzali, of ""Murder One""  fame, is successfully, if surprisingly, cast as the very English villain,  despite occassionally labouring over the dialogue in an attempt to sound  sufficiently plummy. The backdrops, from metropolitan London to Cornish  countryside, are exquisitely shot and add to the fairytale flavour. In all,  a beautiful film, only marred by being slight predictable, but then aren't  most fairytales so?",963014400,5,1276,5.27363184079602
1086528,5,6305901627,"This is the kind of movie you don't see alot of. Movies that touch our hearts in such a way that we love it. If you  love animals and have a heart for them as I do, this is a film for you. A boy who is slower than us, is  abused by hs father after the mother dies, and runs away. He meets  a man  who loves animals, and buries the bodies of raodkill on the sides of the  road. They love each ocher, i'll leave the rest for you to see",960768000,14,433,3.6129032258064515
1086682,5,6305901627,"Thought-provoking and original.  An ex-banker escapes into the woods, takes-up residence in an abandoned cottage, and exercises his love of animals by providing them with the proper burial when cars and trucks run over them on a highway that runs through the forest.  A young man, also an animal lover, runs away from his evil stepfather, and their paths cross.  As an animal lover and a vegetarian, this is one of my favorite films.",1369094400,3,433,4.824324324324325
1086683,4,6305901627,"This film is not one of the better known films of either Christian Bale or John Hurt, however it is a gem well worth viewing.

It is an intimate drama exploring the tightly knit relationship between Bobby, a young man, his abusive step-father, and his companion, ""Mr. Summers.""

The characters are painted with depth and understanding: Bobby's unstable upbringing results in his adult difficulties, but the beauty and fragility of all nature is shown as redemptive.

I highly recommend purchasing this film through Amazon - you'll find a portrait of interesting characters and a quietly moving plot.",1365811200,3,599,5.154639175257732
1086684,4,6305901627,Good movie. Kept me entertained throughout. I would recommend to family and friends. Had some violence but still was a pretty good movie.,1360627200,,137,5.0
1086685,5,6305901627,"If you want a chance to see Christian Bale and John Hurt do some quality acting, then this is your chance.
I haven't been able to find this DVD anywhere so the fact that I got it on Amazon was a big relief.
The film is worth every penny, especially if you can appreciate a good acting duo.",1348704000,,289,4.0
1086686,3,6305901627,"All the Little Animals stars Christian Bale (Bobby) as a ""simple"" adult, John Hurt (Mr. Somers) as the nomadic stranger who befriends him, and Daniel Benzali (""The Fat"") plays one of the most sinister characters of all time as Bobby's sociopath stepfather; he literally had me feeling sick to my stomach.  The ending is tense and nerve-wracking, but shows some directing weaknesses, as we see sudden uncharacteristic actions.  Christian Bale is an extremely intense actor, and this actually works against him here - his eyes are way too intense for someone with mental incapacities.  I see that this film is based upon a novel, which intrigues me, but I really do not enjoy fiction, so the chances of me reading it are slim.  However, the book would probably explain key plot points that the movie did not explore, such as why The Fat is so vicious to people, yet deathly afraid of a small woodland bullfrog.",1331683200,,908,4.801282051282051
1086687,5,6305901627,"The copy of this movie was okay and played okay on my VHS.  It is a nice, calming movie that's not a fast mover, fast action.  Okay shipping.",1270684800,,141,4.0
1086688,5,6305901627,"Christian Bale and John Hurt deliver the finest performances I've watched in quite some time.  I was particularly impressed with Mr. Bale's portrayal of Bobby, a young man who is slightly afflicted with minor mental retardation as the outcome of a car crash where his parents died.

He has reached the ""age of consent"" (18) and comes to the realization that his Uncle (and guardian) is really an evil man who is about to have him institutionalized so he can control Bobby's very sizable inheritance.  Bobby runs away and his life starts to open for him.

John Hurt plays a very mysterious man who lives in the forrest and survives by his own talents and his wits.  What he teaches Bobby is how good can overtake evil.

Any further storyline description could be a ""spoiler,"" so that's as far as I tread.

I will however, say that the entire production of this ""sleeper"" film was executed by devine professionals who knew what they were doing and did it!  Nothing was shoddy in any respect.

Mr. Bale is an absolute knock-out in every way.",1262736000,4,1038,4.628415300546448
1086689,5,6305901627,"I bought this movie in the used section at Blockbuster because of the description on the DVD packaging.  Good deal for $3.99. But what a treasure the movie really is! For me the movie is about the study and contrasts of human relationships and people's relationships with nature and animals. It's a very moving film.

As mentioned by other reviewers, this movie really is an allegorical tale. To me it works on many levels. Christian Bale is a naiive, pained soul who runs away from a hurtful environment. He runs into John Hurt's character in the woods.  John Hurt reinforces Bale's love of animals and Hurt also finds Bale's character freeing enough to share his own history.
Together they share a small cottage in the woods where they both find comfort and solace being nature's caretakers.

The dnouement of the film happens when Bales and Hurt's characters come face to face with the very thing they know is true: of all the animals, the cruelest is man.  Bales comes to the realization at a critical point in the movie that he has to be the protector not only of the small animals and creatures that he loves but also the protector of fellow harmless human beings, and most importantly, he finds his place in the world and needs to defend it.

Christian Bale is phenomenal. I can see why he has a cult-like fanatical following. I am now a convert.

I've never liked a too formulaic movie and this movie is very different: a pained young man develops a relationship with an old loner in the woods and they bury dead animals together? Wow! But it is exactly that unusual situation that makes the film work. Getting in touch with mother nature reveals much about human nature. It's a very sincere film about healing, trust, happiness, courage, compassion, and contentment. The film is rated ""R"" for some violence but if you let your kids see depictions of war or street violence on TV or in movies, or play those various violent video games then those kids SHOULD watch this film. It's a good film for the heart, mind, and soul.",1232496000,6,2031,4.625

1086691,3,6305901627,"Unfortunately, this movie doesn't know what kind of movie it is.  It starts out as a psychological drama, even an odd couple movie, but then suddenly, unexpectedly veers into a thriller.  If they wanted it to be a thriller, they needed to show more of the evil side of 'Fats' much earlier in the movie.  If they wanted it to be a psychological drama, then they needed to peacefully overcome the evil of 'Fats' to show that Bobby could have a fulfilling life, even with his intellectual limitations.  Both aspects of the movie are very good, but they simply don't reasonably fit together.  Because the acting of John Hurt and Christian Bale is excellent, it is worth watching.  (Rarely is a normal intelligence actor able to believably play a truly simple character, but Mr. Bale does the best job I've ever seen.)",1167782400,4,813,4.690140845070423
1086752,4,6305901627,"Unfortunately, I purchased this movie from Amazon when they were still claiming that it was available in a wide screen format! Alas, when it arrived in fullscreen, I was really bummed out. It's a great film and as such, it really deserves a proper presentation. I suggest following it up with a viewing of American Psycho. The polarity of Bale's performances in each of these films is almost frightening....",1142121600,2,407,4.913043478260869
1086753,4,6305901627,"As has been noted, this is an allegorical film and people will often divide down the middle over allegories.  If you appreciate them and like digging beneath the surface, this is a remarkable film in a great many regards.  Even as just a basic tale, the film works and is given outstanding performances by the three principal actors.  Not enough good can be said about Christian Bale, who is maturing one of the finest actors we have today.  Here, Bale is playing his exact age, 24, but looks no more than 17.  As Bobby is mildly retarded due to a childhood accident of which he has more than one scar to serve as reminder, he is eternally a boy trapped in a man's body.  When it comes to playing ""damaged goods"" Bale pulls off the nearly impossible, making you forget the actor and see only the character.  (This was my primary difficulty with Forrest Gump, where everything seemed to draw attention to Mr. Hanks' brilliant ""acting."")

Bobby isn't too dim to sense the evil of his stepfather ""The Fat"" aka Mr. De Winter, and upon his mother's death, realizes the man is out to do him serious harm.  By refusing to sign over to The Fat, his inheritances, including the family's successful London department store, Bobby has sealed his fate.  The Fat is going to have him declared mad and institutionalized for the remainder of his life.  Bobby escapes the mansion, and wends his way towards Cornwall in search of his grandfather.  The journey is brief, but symbolic as he finds rides along the trek, a young, hippy family in a van, complete with happy little dog, and an odious trucker whose zest for killing animals in the road causes his death.  Wanting to help the trapped, barely alive trucker we stumble upon Mr. Summers (John Hurt) an odd hermit with a few affectations and full of mystery.  An unlikely relationship develops between the two men, as Bobby finally finds the father figure denied him all his life.  Summers takes Bobby in and instructs him in ""The Work"" - caring for the burial of animals killed at the hands (and wheels) of man.  These scenes, shot in and around Cornwall, are dazzling . . . breathtakingly beautiful.

Inevitably their idyllic existence gives way to the reemergence of The Fat and confrontation, danger, resolution and acceptance.  It's a beautiful tale of good versus evil and innocence versus cunning.  The acting is uniformly excellent, with a truly stunning performance by Mr. Bale.",1126483200,48,2425,4.730952380952381
1086754,4,6305901627,"All the Little Animals follows the off-kilter adventures of Bobby Platt (Christian Bale), a young man who's been left a simpleton by the long-ago car accident that damaged his brain but not his soul. He wholeheartedly loves animals and he's got a pet mouse named Peter, but Bobby has to keep Peter hidden from his wicked stepfather, De Winter (Daniel Benzali). Unable to handle De Winter's abuse any longer Bobby runs away, hitchhiking from London to Cornwall, where he meets Mr. Summers (John Hurt). Summers is a quiet man who's devoted his life to giving dead animals a reverent burial, and he trains Bobby to follow in his footsteps.

Even though the movie's title is All the Little Animals, there aren't any developed animal characters. Peter is cute, but he's out of the picture pretty quick. The rest are corpses, or depicted in wistful dream sequences (the fox is a fixture, and there's also an otter, a horse and a beaver). The human characters are sort of one-dimensional - particularly The Fat - but the actors are all superb. Benzali and Hurt's reputations precede them, but Bale is very underrated. That may change when his high-profile role of Batman hits the big screen, but as of now the general public doesn't know him. He's an actor of great range, proven by his equally convincing portrayals of simple and sweet Bobby Platt in All the Little Animals and diabolical, murderous Patrick Bateman in American Psycho shortly after.

1086755,5,6305901627,"After accidentally stumbling upon this movie on the Sundance channel, I instantly fell in love with its mysterious and allegorical nature. Subsequently, I proceeded to purchase the book (by Walker Hamilton), which, in my opinion, is much better than the movie. When one ponders the meaning of ""allegory"", we automatically think of George Orwell's famous novel ""Animal Farm"". However, unlike Orwell's book, ""All the Little Animals"" contains more subtle insights into the forces of Good and Evil in life. This is probably the reason why the film and the book have slipped by virtually unnoticed in the world of great English literature. In fact, it was quite hard finding a copy of the book which I had to order it off of ...""Out of Print"" section. All in all, this story has a powerful and haunting message, which can be credited to Walker Hamilton's brilliantly simple but amazingly complex writing style.
I believe Walker Hamilton's allegorical message is especially geared towards those of an intellectual nature-- separate from the corrupted minds of the masses. It calls out to all the Mr. Sommers in the world, all who are ostracized from society for refusing to uphold social conformities, beckoning them to watch over and care for ""all the little animals"" (which are the innocent souls such as Bobby Platt). We must be on guard then, ready to resist the wicked acts of those who harm innocent life (The Fat)-- always remembering all the little animals....",1053734400,8,1462,4.995901639344262
1086756,2,6305901627,"The film not only didn't do justice to the book but also lost the feel, the atmosphere and the message. Christian Bale, a fine actor, is horribly mis-cast. Some key scenes were lost from the book and I question the choices made by the writer and/or director with regards to this. Obvious commercial decisions caused this film to lack the emotive power that was so evident in the novel. Read the book, forget the film.",1051401600,3,417,4.573333333333333
1086757,3,6305901627,"Not the best film out there but a unique interesting one. And worth a viewing on some lazy afternoon if your not expecting much. Bobby hasn't been right since a car accident when he was a liitle boy. And now he's stuck with his sadistic stepfather, who puts the stepmother from Cinderella to shame. Bobby decides to run away, and runs into an old man devoid of technology. This man dedicates his life to burying dead animals(most of them by the road) while shouting obscentities at the cars( or as he calls them, ""killing machines"") Although the ending doesn't really fit the film, it doesn't make it worse than it already is. This film isn't spectacular in any way, but it's odd enough compared to most films, and if you see it...I doubt you'll all together regret it.",1028419200,,769,4.579710144927536
1086758,4,6305901627,A pretty simple yet intelligent film. Kind of makes you reconsider what constitues a happy life. I can see this being broadcast on the Independant Film Channel or Bravo as it's not exactly filed with the material typical of a Hollywood Box Office hit...all the more reason to see it. If you can enjoy movies without large amounts of sex and/or violence this would be worth checking out. Great acting by John Hurt and Christian Bale.,1012262400,2,432,4.697368421052632
1086759,5,6305901627,"This is an excellent motion picture that details human emotion and survival.  A wonderful display of charity toward animals of a lesser nature than man. A triumphant journey into the hearts of mankind.  It's good to feel a movie for a change, where money and power isn't the main focus.",1010966400,,286,4.7
1086760,5,6305901627,"This is one of those quirky, oddball films which sit on the shelves in video rentals and only get rented when everything else is gone. This is a shame because this is a gem of a work: the acting is solid, the direction seamless and the cinematography haunting.
But it is not for everyone.
The easy read is that this is a movie for animal lovers, pantheistic day dreamers who think animals are more valuable than humans. But the story within the story reveals the struggle between good and evil which dogs humankind, no matter how much we humans want to deny its existence.
Its allegorical connotations reverberate throughout, and trying to nail down the characters into neat concepts somehow betrays the originality of the film.
Suffice it to say the Mr. Sommers is caught between his love for things innocent and his self-destructive hatred for things which he believes evil; ultimately this leads to a lack of judgment which costs him his life and I am, sad to say, not sure whether he ever realizes that much of his life has been spent trying to connect with a goodness which eludes him.
Each character is rich in symbolism, though Bobby and Mr. Sommers obviously dominate.
I urge you to see this film for yourself and decide how this allegory runs. In so doing you will discover much of yourself.",1004313600,7,1300,4.656521739130435

I am not usually a crying, sappy type of movie watcher, but towards the end of the movie, I was crying my eyes out. It was very moving for me, since sometimes I can relate to Christian's characture, Bobby Platt. The story of a young man, 24, who's mentally slow after being in the way of a car years ago, with a step-father who, as Bobby put it ""Shouted"" his mother to death, who abuses poor Bobby, runs away and finds the kindest, best friend there is.

Christian Bale is great in this early role, playing a very kind and decent young man. John Hurt is wonderful, and the villain is as close to evil as it gets. The music is captivating, and you will keep humming it long after the movie is over. If music grabs you as much as the story, also try The Hired Hand with Peter Fonda- another oldie. You won't see Christian Bale in any other role even close to the one he plays, in Little Animals- including his British accent. Good acting, flows well, and many meaningful moments.
