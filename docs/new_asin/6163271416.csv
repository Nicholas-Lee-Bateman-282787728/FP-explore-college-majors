208207,2,6163271416,"The movie itself is a classic.  Four out of Four stars easily.  HOWEVER, this review is for my purchase of the DVD through this 3rd party seller.  I received the disc but it looked suspiciously like a bootleg copy that I'd easily pick up in the streets of NYC.  I inserted the disc into my player and fortunately it worked.  BUT, the picture quality is CLEARLY a ripped video file burned onto a counterfeit disc - tons of image banding and artifacting especially when camera shot is in motion.  Very disappointed.",1462924800,4,513,4.582417582417582
208208,5,6163271416,"I watched it with my parents and my children. My parents were about the same age as the main character of the movie, and they both walked the similar paths as the protagonist of the movie. For them, and to a lesser degree my wife and I, who grew up in Korea during the 70s and 80s, this movie was not just a mere story of a random man, but the story of our own lives. Even my kids, reading the English subtitles, were glued to the movie till the end.",1461283200,,450,3.956043956043956

208210,5,6163271416,"After I played Dumbo for my wife to show her a sad moment from my childhood, she had me watch Ode to my Father - she is Korean.  I normally think of myself as a hard-knocks kind of guy, but I was totally shutup.  I was blown away on a complete roller-coaster.  This movie will correct your perspective and make you thankful for what you have.  A great movie.  The US university students looking for a ""safe space"" should see this movie.  Also the opening minutes of Shiri.",1458604800,3,472,4.306818181818182

208212,4,6163271416,"Ode to My father (Gukjesijang) is a moving South Korean drama about the life of Yoon Deok-soo (Hwang Jung-min), who as a boy is separated from his father and younger sister during the confusion of the Korean War. Deok-soo and his mother and two siblings travel to Busan, where they start a new life at his aunts grocery store in the Gukje Market.

Many years later, Deok-soo, now grown up, works hard as the breadwinner of the family because he promised his father when they parted that he will protect the family members. But will Deok-soo ever meet again him and his missing sister?

While following the eventful life of Deok-soo  like his marriage with Youngja (Yunjin Kim) and grueling work in West Germany where he is employed as a collier  the epic drama unfolds against the backdrop of the modern history of South Korea. You may miss the films amusing references to such people as Chung Ju-yung, founder of Hyundai Groups, or fashion designer Andr Kim.

You may be familiar with the name of director JK Youn, but if you are a Korean film fan, perhaps you have seen a 2009 disaster movie Tidal Wave he directed. As in Tsunami, all the characters wear their heart on their sleeve, and probably this is where the viewers opinions divide.

But most viewers would agree that the film is well-acted and its story well told, with convincing production designs that represent the sixty-year history of the protagonist as well as the country.",1442102400,,1440,4.717131474103586
208213,5,6163271416,"For anyone interested in how Koreans rose up from the ashes of the Korean War, this is the movie to see. By tracing the lives of an old couple, we see what the Koreans went through during the 1950s to 1970s as they survived hardship in foreign lands and made sacrifices to support their families. We also see glimpses of famous Koreans such as the founder of Hyundai and Andre Kim, a trailblazing fashion designer. The attitude of this couple's children is a reflection of the younger generation who've forgotten the hardship of their parents. A well-made movie that makes you laugh and cry.",1440633600,2,591,4.6923076923076925

7802688,5,6163271416,"I bought in 2017 and specifically the DVD with a region code that can play on US machines. It works fine.

I appreciated the subtitles making it clear to English speakers some of the more subtle interactions, like his short meeting with who would later be the founder of a major conglomerate, that could have been lost on people outside Korea. I was glad the war scenes were not too long. I preferred the main couple in other movies. I love the director included Hwang Jung-min's trademark dance style in this movie. The best part was the when they were trying to find relatives in the 1980's. Those scenes made the movie worth watching. What struck me was not only was this man's children oblivious to what he went through his younger brother and sister also seemed quite sheltered and selfish as well. I would have liked to know more of the Yunjin Kim's character's story. Jung Jin-Young, Kim Seoul Gi and Ra Mi-ran performed well.",1491091200,3,933,4.620481927710843
7802689,5,6163271416,"How many times can one cry while watching a movie?  While it did seem combine experiences of many people into this main character's life, this brought home the pain and despair of families being separated due to the devastation of war.  It is one of the best movies I saw this past year.",1478908800,2,287,4.39622641509434
7802690,5,6163271416,"Ode to My Father (the literal translation of the Korean title is International Market) is a tear-jerking story of the protagonist Duk-Soo who is separated from his sister during the evacuation of Hungnam (Korean War 1950) and his family's subsequent life over the next four decades.  His story is one which takes you through prominent periods of Korean history and what it was like to get by in post-war Korea.  I will not rehash the plot here but it eventually returns to a promise that Duk-Soo makes to his father as the new head of his family as the reason he stubbornly refuses to sell a struggling store in the Busan International Market.  Although those familiar with Korean history and those with family members who lived through this period will identify with the struggles presented, the conflicts and emotions displayed are universal.  I dare you not to cry.",1475193600,,868,4.844594594594595
7802691,5,6163271416,"Ode to My Father was an interesting Korean movie which had many compelling scenes. However the movie draws you in that that was not a hindrance as it was easy to forget that you were even reading what was being said. The story begins with the story focus on Duk-soo's (Jeong-min Hwang) life from the time he was a young boy fleeing Korea during the Korean War, along with aspects of his life throughout the 60's, 70's and 80's all the way to the present when he is an old man. This movie seems to use Duk-soo's reality as a representation of the many struggles and hardships of life that a lot of Koreans went through following the Korean War. Its sub-point of intent may have been to point out these struggles to the young Korean generation of today in order that they would have some realization with what their grandparents sacrificed so that they may have the life they do today. The story is a historical timeline that many Korean families can share and relate with. It impacts the heart and aids with processing past pains. I felt like the movie was moving even though I personally have not experienced any tragic loss.

One thing this movie has is a lot of heart and it is clearly portrayed by the actors, many times in an over-the-top manner. It is definitely melodramatic. But that may have been the directors intent to try to get the point across for how hard this guy's life was. There is one scene where everyone on screen is crying and wailing away and a woman says, ""I miss my mommy."" There were some comic relief moments throughout. One actress American audiences may recognize is Yunjin Kim who played Sun Kwan on the series LOST (2004). The special effects were pretty good and cinematography not bad. Though there were some silly moments throughout the film these can be overlooked when focusing on the story. Boredom or tiredness never set in while watching this as it held my interest the whole time.
It is a movie worth checking out. Koreans for sure will relate better to it than some foreigners, but it does offer an insight into Korean life of yore for the non-native Korean..",1472688000,2,2100,4.555555555555555
