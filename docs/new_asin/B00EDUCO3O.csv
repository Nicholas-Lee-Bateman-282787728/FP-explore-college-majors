5905244,3,B00EDUCO3O,"NIce set with some fun stuff for kids, too bad I didn't know about the new Blu-ray releases or I would have waited.",1385942400,,115,4.043478260869565
5905245,5,B00EDUCO3O,"I'm excited to finally own all the theatrical Muppet films on Blu-Ray.
I personally believe that 'The Great Muppet Caper' should be featured on the left side, and the Muppet Treasure should be on the right, so they go in order by release. Nonetheless, I'm not bothered it is a double feature because I can get both films for the price of one, which is actually very low considering the Muppet Movie is the same price and that's only for one film.
The disc (assuming it's a single disc, this is Disney) will include the following special features:
- The Tale of the Story Beyond the Tail, a making-of look at Muppet Treasure Island
- Muppet Treasure Island Audio Commentary
- ""Frog-E-Oke"" sing-along
- ""Let the Good Shine Out""
- A preview of Muppets Most Wanted
and if Disney re-uses the 2005 DVD releases in this set, then
Muppet Trasure Island DVD should feature Widescreen + Fullscreen prestentaion and Pepe Profiles: Fozzy Bear; and the Great Muppet Caper should feature feature Widescreen + Fullscreen presentation and another Pepe Profiles: Miss Piggy. So at least we are gaining more special features on this release! Thanks Disney for not cheaping out on us after the last few double packs!

Now if only we can get Disney to release The Muppet Show 1-5 on Blu-Ray or at least the last seasons on DVD.

Muppet Blu-Rays:
The Muppet Movie (1979)
The Great Muppet Caper (1981) w/ Muppet Treasure Island
The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984) - Released by Sony Pics.
The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)
Muppet Treasure Island (1996) w/ The Great Muppet Caper
Muppets From Space (1999) - Released by Sony Pics.
The Muppets (2011)

Personally, I'd like to see The Muppets' Wizard of Oz on Blu-Ray, I'm surprised Disney didn't release it when Oz: the Great and Powerful released. And if Disney can get the rights to It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, then they could release it with A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa. Nonetheless, I'm just glad they released the mainstream theatrical Muppet films on Blu-Ray, thanks Disney and Sony!

Now onto the cover art, I personally think it looks fine. I think the combined artwork looks better than boxed artwork like Emperor's New Groove Double Pack, the only probably is that they're out of order. I can't wait to see the movies on Blu-Ray, the last few Muppet films have looked amazing! I expect Disney to give us the best quality possible, even if their latest Blu-Rays have missed dot (i.e, Sword in the Stone).",1377993600,2,2461,4.769953051643192
5905246,5,B00EDUCO3O,"Aside from 'Disney's The Muppets' released in 2011, 'Muppet Treasure Island' and 'The Great Muppet Caper' are two of my favorite Muppet movies. I also liked 'The Muppets' Christmas Carol' and 'The Muppet Movie'...'Muppets From Space' is so-so, but for some reason I couldn't seem to get into 'The Muppets Take Manhattan' (I never even seen the full movie).
The way I see it, this combo pack was released so they could have all the prior theatrical Muppet movies on Blu-ray format, before 'Disney's The Muppets Most Wanted' is released in 2014. For me personally, this double feature is a 'dream team' since I loved both movies and the price is 'affordable' for my budget...I just might have to consider the Blu-ray versions of the other four Muppet film I don't have on Blu-ray, since I have 'Disney's The Muppets' on Blu-ray combo pack and all the other Muppet films on DVD. For some reason, if I like something I tend to (as I call it) 'Upgrade' if I can to the next home media format they have available (I've debated on 'upgrading' 'The Muppets' Christmas Carol' and 'Muppet From Space' for awhile now). However I need to take baby steps, but Muppets' Most Wanted is just around the bend, so I gotta start thinking really hard.",1377561600,5,1231,4.67741935483871
5905247,4,B00EDUCO3O,"First, I am a 36 year old male and have hated these generic computer print-out looking covers ever since they became the trend.  Real artists designed the original theatrical posters.  I rejoiced to see that the re-release for ""The Muppet Movie"" soundtrack is a nod to the original artwork of Miss Piggy and Kermit in a little boat.  Thank you, thank you, to the genius who trusted the audience enough to market it like that.  Now if only they could have gone all the way and included the actual original artwork, which featured celebrity faces.  There was also that terrific poster of Piggy and Kermit as Gone with the Wind characters above the studebaker full of Muppets.  One could have been the cd cover, one could have been the blu-ray cover.  Oh well.

""Great Muppet Caper"" had artwork of Miss Piggy busting through a newspaper on a motorcycle.  ""Muppet Treasure Island"" was an elaborate piece of art with nearly every character included.

These two films are such strange choices to stick together.  I guess it's because neither would sell as well on its own as the other Muppet films?  Why not release a complete box set of all the films with all the original covers included?  These two are absolutely disjointed; it's weird.  Shall I be happy that it's more of a 2-for-1?  I guess so.  But then at least give them legitimate artwork.

Would have been better like this:  ""Muppet Movie/Muppet Caper"" ""Muppets Take Manhattan/ Muppets from Space"" ""Muppet Christmas Carol/Muppet Treasure Island""... with front and back covers of the original artwork.  I dunno.

PS. ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""Labyrinth"" each had one of the most memorable and beautiful theatrical posters I can recall.  Look at their crap blu-ray covers.  What a waste.  They'd stand out a million times better at Best-Buy with the original art.  I'd jump up and down if they ever released them that way.",1376524800,8,1873,4.799373040752351

5905249,2,B00EDUCO3O,"On one hand, we get two Muppet films making their home video debut in high definition.  On the other, whoever came up with the idea of putting them together as a double feature is probably a 22 year-old dimwit exec straight out of college with a laughable marketing degree, and here's why:

a) THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER is a classic in its own right and deserves an individual release.  Combining it with the entertaining yet less remarkable TREASURE ISLAND simply diminishes its status.  It would make more sense to create a double feature of THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND as they're both riffs on classic literature and were released consecutively (movies four and five)

b) Instead, we get the second and fifth features in the same package, BUT the fifth feature is displayed ""first"" on the cover artwork (because, ya know, the pirate era happened before the 1980's, so... it's chronological order)

Don't you just love it when the best stuff is in the hands of people who have absolutely no idea what they're doing?",1376524800,13,1040,4.814606741573034

5905260,4,B00EDUCO3O,The picture quality is OK as far as blu-rays go. I would have given this five stars if not for the 5.1 audio mix on Muppet Treasure Island. Everything is where it should be in the mix except for the main dialog from every person or character who spoke in the entire film. You can hear the character's dialog OK but for some reason it got placed in the left channel  instead of the center channel and is very annoying. I only have one other blu-ray that was mixed this way. I played it on all the blu-ray players I have and the audio is still the same with nice stereo sound except for the main dialog placed in the left channel. This lets me know it's not an audio decoding glitch in my blu-ray player but a error from the Studio. Beats the heck out of me why Disney would allow the audio to get mixed this way on the blu-ray because the dialog was correctly placed in the center channel in the audio on every previous release.,1436832000,,927,4.17877094972067

5905269,1,B00EDUCO3O,"This set is proof positive of two things:

1) Just because it's a Blu-ray disc doesn't mean the content is of great quality, and
2) While Disney typically does a wonderful job of remastering classic movies when releasing them on Blu-ray, they also occassionally don't seem to care about quality whatsoever.

I've always loved the Great Muppet Caper.  To me, the original Muppet Movie and it's follow-up, the Great Muppet Caper were the two best Muppet features.  So I was looking forward to finally having it on Blu-ray.  I admit that I had not previously sen Muppet Treasure Island, but I was looking forward to finally seeing that as well.

First, we watched MTI, having not seen it before.  While the video was of OK quality (although certainly nothing spectacular), the audio quality was terrible.  It's as if when they remastered it, they didn't realize the vocal tracks were not at the same level/volume.  The music and sound effects were fine, but it was difficult to hear the actors' lines whenever there was also music playing and/or sounds effects.  The only time we could here the conversations was when there was no music or sound effects.  And even then, we had to turn up the volume on our system quite high.

Next, we watched TGMC.  While the sound seemed somewhat OK on this one, the video quality was just terrible.  It wasn't even DVD quality.  It literally looked like we were watching an old VHS tape of the movie.

So if you're looking to ""upgrade"" your existing copy of both/either of these movies from your existing DVD copies (or even VHS tapes, for that matter), don't bother.  It's just not worth it.  You're not going to get anything close to Blu-ray HD quality.  The only way I can recommend purchasing this set is if you don't have the movies at all, and you're willing to settle for a low-quality copy of them.",1412380800,9,1840,4.658385093167702

When I began to watch the opening credits, I became worried.  The clarity that Disney has brought to its previous releases has been astounding.  Looking at The Jungle Book or Snow White has been wonderful because of the care they took into restoring and cleaning the picture.  I was severely disappointed through the entire movie.  There were times that the picture was not bad, but overall it was not great.  I was a little more satisfied when I watched Muppet Treasure Island, but to me it only seemed to be acceptable because the movie is a little more recent.  I know that Disney was trying to roll out the full catalog of Muppet movies that they own on Blu-ray as quickly as they could.  I would have been willing to wait a few more months of individually released disc in order to get a great presentation.

The Great Muppet Caper:
This one wasn't that great. It drags a bit in a number of places, and the plot is a bit convoluted and slow. However, there are quite a few genuinely funny moments in the movie as well (pretty much all of the scenes in the motel with the band are golden) and the plot gets pretty interesting about halfway through the movie.

3 stars
-------------------------------------------------

Muppet Treasure Island
This movie is just EXCELLENT. It has everything you could ask for in a Muppet movie: action, comedy, stars and awesome puppetry! Right off the bat, a major factor to recommend this movie is that it co-stars Tim Curry -- who is awesome!  Second, there are a LOT more action scenes in the movie than you generally get with Muppet movies, think The Labyrinth for the amount and type of scenes. Last, the plot is ripped straight from Treasure Island (which is a good story), and then Muppet-ized to make it more interesting.

5905292,4,B00EDUCO3O,"This review originally appeared on MiceChat

Ive always loved the Muppets. Ever since I was a kid, Ive watched them, be it on TV for Muppet Show re-runs or in the theaters for their latest round of movies.

There is a certain divide, though, between the films. They were original stories at first, taking the Muppets on great adventures with them as the focal point. But then, the focus shifted, and they started adapting great literary works, and were pushed to secondary roles, with humans in the lead.

This blu-ray combines two films, one from each of those eras, and is quite a strange pairing. However, in my mind, The Great Muppet Caper And Muppet Treasure Island: Of Pirates & Pigs 2-Movie Collection [Blu-ray] works.

Starting with the earlier of the two films, The Great Muppet Caper was always one of, if not my absolute, favorite of the original Muppet films. I had a VHS of it as a kid that I wore out. For those of you who have never seen it before, Kermit and Fozzie play twin brothers, which is one of the movies running jokes, who also happen to be reporters. Gonzo is their photographer who comes along for the ride. While on assignment in London investigating the jewel heist of Lady Holiday, Kermit runs into Miss Piggy, who tricks him into thinking that SHE is Lady Holiday. Naturally, Muppet hilarity ensues. The film may not be one of the greatest stories ever told, but it is fantastic. Its also the ONLY Muppet film that Jim Henson himself directed. The musical numbers are also pretty great.

The films transfer to blu-ray is absolutely stunningso much so that I was kind of surprised by how good it looked. It even sounds fantastic! Not bad for a film that old, I have to say.

Muppet Treasure Island was always my favorite of the literary adaptations. It is, of course, a re-telling of Treasure Island. Tim Curry really steals the show as Long John Silver, even if that does mean the Muppets take backseat roles. I have not seen it in quite a few years, but I wasn't surprised to find myself singing along whenever the music came on. Though, admittedly, the music here isn't as great as Caper, but it is pretty catchy. I mean, how can you not crack a smile and sing along to Cabin Fever?!

Being released 15 years after Caper, Muppet Treasure Island does look a bit better on blu-ray, but both films are stunning, none the less.

The only downside to this release is that there are no new special features to write home about. Included on the disc are the original, DVD extras from Muppet Treasure Island: an audio commentary, a behind the scenes documentary, and a music video. There are a few Frog-E-Oke tracks to accompany both films, but thats it. Its disappointing to not see anything new for either film.

However, with this release, we now have all of the Muppet films available on blu-ray, and for that I am thankful. While it would have been great to have individual releases with a lot of features, Ill take what I can get when it comes to the Muppets. If you're a fan of these films, you won't be disappointed by this release.",1391126400,11,3065,4.548094373865699

5905298,5,B00EDUCO3O,"The transfers are quality transfers, no real special rework done, the films are new enough that there has not yet been a lot of degrading of the prints to contend with. The sound is average quality, overall a nice package that completes the efforts of Disney to bring all the muppet films to Blu Ray",1388448000,,299,4.454545454545454

5905300,3,B00EDUCO3O,"The muppet caper blu-ray seems to work fine however the muppet treasure island blu-ray loses sound after a minute or two.  I may try to play around with it and see if it is only temporary or if the entire movie is ""silent.""  I stopped after a minute of no sound because my daughter was getting mad, tried restarting, and same issue.  May try a third time and fast forward to see if a temporary problem or a big problem.  I am debating if I should exchange for another copy because I paid the price to watch the movies in blu-ray (not DVD) - had to put the DVD treasure island on so my daughter could watch without frustration however the reason I spent the extra money was to have the movies on blu-ray.  Muppet Treasure Island is not a favorite of mine but I think my daughter likes it and I am glad to have Muppet Caper on blu-ray.",1388361600,,833,4.18125
5905301,5,B00EDUCO3O,"Jim Henson was a creative genius, full of humor and inventive story-telling, delighting children and adults alike. I was as addicted to Sesame Street as my three-year-old son was. Caper was always one of my favorites but I didn't care for Treasure Island, perhaps because Piggy doesn't show up until halfway through the movie and the story is too well-known to be surprising even with Muppets. Therefore, I jumped at the chance to have Caper in blu-ray. The opening credits of Caper told me this was no 'remastered' job - this was the transfer of an old movie by people who had no respect for the love and care that Henson put into everything he did and then had the gall to call it a blu-ray. It may be an improvement but no one sat down and did the kind of job that this film deserved, even if they had to clean it up frame by frame. Being shoved into a two-fer like 'Atlantis' should have clued me in. Treasure Island is a better transfer, probably only because it is a newer movie. And I gained a new respect for it watching Tim Curry have a ball as Long John Silver (see him in CLUE for the totally manic performance he is capable of).  It used to be that Disney was known as the best studio for demo-quality blu-ray (Tangled is an example), but the last year they have rushed out second tier movies (Robin Hood, The Sword in the Stone), made their millions, laughed all the way to the bank and suckered collectors like me to pay for second (or third or fourth) rate blu-ray. They should rename themselves the Evil Cartoon Company, formerly known as Disney.",1387065600,11,1562,4.423611111111111
