8626393,5,B00GRHVI3I,"Bjork blends the sounds of nature in her music masterfully as Attenborough excitedly explains the entire science of it all. This reveals much more fascinating facts than a concert could reveal. For instance, a musical instrument was developed to play using gravity.",1443312000,,265,5.333333333333333
8626394,5,B00GRHVI3I,Great; I only wish it was longer!,1440633600,,33,3.857142857142857
8626395,3,B00GRHVI3I,"This is an extremely short made for TV special that features a little bit of a trivial strokefest between Bjork and David Attenborough.  Bjork's Biophilia project is interesting but there's way more info in free online vids than can be found here.  At best, this is a puff piece and hardly worth the cost.  It really should have been an extra on the Biophilia concert video.",1423267200,7,374,4.636363636363637
8626396,5,B00GRHVI3I,"An marvelous documentary, where two genius come and meet each other. Excellent quality video",1420416000,,92,5.642857142857143

8626398,5,B00GRHVI3I,"Whoever is a Bjork fan will most certainly buy this, because most of her fans are die-hards who have followed her her whole career. I fall into that category, and my collection is pretty large. What I want to say about this release is that even if you are not a Bjork fan, it is worth peeking into the mind of a humble creative genius. It is fascinating to see how Bjork is influenced by more than just music -- in this case, science and nature, which is the theme of her album ""Biophilia"" and the release on which this film is based. It is a conversation between Bjork and Attenborough -- the kind of conversation you wish you could have yourself. The film is interspersed with scenes from nature, the Natural History Museum, and bits from her ""Biophilia"" tour, which featured musical instruments that were never made before and commissioned specifically for this project. Take a gravity harp, for example, or the tesla coil synthesizer, which mimics lightning as the bass line for the song ""Thunderbolt."" This will be a great companion piece to the ""Biophilia Live"" film being shown at international film festivals and art houses, which I will be traveling to see soon (and I hope subsequently also comes out on DVD). Anyone who is into educational programs or the arts should watch this. This is who I wrote the review for. Bjork fans certainly already own this treat.",1411862400,14,1371,4.669421487603306
