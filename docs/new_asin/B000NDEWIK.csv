8177226,5,B000NDEWIK,"The dance couple that demonstrate this DVD are nice looking and speak clearly.  This is a DVD for beginners. It has a good section on latin motion and the best section I have ever seen on how to teach the woman to do the perfect dip.  Most women are like a board when they try to dip and the man needs to be very strong or he will drop her.  This DVD shows the woman that she can learn to dip by herself without any help from the man.  This makes it much easier on the man when he does lead the woman into a dip because he doesnot need much strength to hold her and mostly helps her keep her balance.  The type of dip they teach also looks much better than what most women are inclined to do.  So it is a win-win type situation.  The woman looks better and the man doesn't break his back trying to hold the woman up while she is dipping.  The tape is worth the price just for this one step, plus the other steps are nice looking as well.",1353110400,3,937,3.9468085106382977
8177227,3,B000NDEWIK,Only problem with this DVD is that it comes with onlt 4 dance figures so thats $10 per dance figure.  Not really worth the money.  Great instruction though on more basic dance step figures.,1197158400,6,189,4.529411764705882
