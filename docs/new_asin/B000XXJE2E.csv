8230086,5,B000XXJE2E,"This was an enjoyable look into the life of comedians during an ongoing contest at a comedy club.  Many of the comedians are up and coming with fresh, unheard of humor which made us both laugh and reflect.  Especially interesting were the one to one conversations with these same comedians as they discuss reasons for what makes them so drawn to stand up entertaining.  A really well directed dvd which kept us interested, alert and laughing throughout the entire hour and a half.",1195689600,,480,4.759036144578313
