I am satisfied with my purchase.",1364688000,,112,4.333333333333333
7912431,1,B00000JLTM,"I was very disappointed in purchasing this tape for my nephew.  It was Classics: Bible songs.  My nephew is autistic and cannot talk but loves music. I thought this may help him speak while listening in the car. Instead I received a tape that was destroyed thru the mail.  I wrote the people who sent it to me and they told me that it was not their fault to write Amazon.com which I did and have not heard one word from them.

Very disappointed with the service of both parties

the reason I gave it one start was because I HAD to rate it or this would not go thru, otherwise it would be a big ZERO",1267574400,,598,4.076923076923077
7912432,4,B00000JLTM,"the cedermont kids go at a swift pace which makes it somewhat challenging and frustrating for younger children (4 and under) to learn the words which is the funnest part for them.  the articulation is not always the best and the children do sing swiftly so be sure to watch it with your child(ren) the first several times.  the children will love it though.  please note: this pertains not to this video but to toddler tunes, preschool and one other that i forgot the tittle of (even the toddler tunes go quickly).",1051315200,,514,4.565217391304348
7912433,5,B00000JLTM,I was glad this was the first video that my daughter sang along with out loud.  It reminded me of some of the songs I sang as a child in church camp.  She loves to play it and sing along and we definitely approve.  We  are looking for more in this set.,943488000,9,252,3.7884615384615383
7912434,5,B00000JLTM,Kids love to watch the Cedarmont videos.  They have short songs with interesting action (such as kids ice-skating).  My son loves them!,940982400,,135,5.090909090909091
