8004737,5,B0000YWQZI,"This dvd shows a lot of good techniques that are easy to follow and look like they'll be effective on the street. I first rented this dvd from netflix, and realized it was something I wanted to own so I could take my time and learn all the material. Sometimes their yelling and ki-yahing is humorously melodramatic and a bit over the top, but it doesn't negate the effectiveness of what they're doing...just makes it somewhat more entertaining to watch.",1378944000,,453,4.675

Women's Self Defense - techniques 96-100

Volume 2 seems to me to be more like a continuation of what was started in volume one and then has the feel of having several categories ""bolted on"" to fill up the tape. This tape in general contains a lot more material that seems a bit impractical for ""self defense"". There are less close ups, less descriptions, and a very loose sense of organization. The partner who gets the techniques applied to him is very annoying with his screams and moans, even during the slow speed demonstrations. However, as an overall catalog of Hapkido material it is very valuable, showing the diversity of the art and providing a ""teaser' for people who may be interesting in learning this art.

Some quibbles I have based on my own opinion include:

-The categories like ""Defense vs Grappling, Holds, and Ground Defense"" would seem to address a need to address the range of ground grappling. However, it doesn't. The categories cover standing material like chokes and lapel grabs and only the ground defense category has the defender on the ground, where he uses two basic defenses against the mount and his partner obviously leaps off him without much effort on the defender's part.

-The defenses against two attackers were very unrealistic, usually using a side kick to remove the first one from the picture and then turning the defender's back on that first one to attack the other. The partners are very compliant and throw themselves with the slightest movement.

-The ""Sun Sool"" or ""Initiative Attack"" was pretty good for learning basics but then again, it's very easy to walk up and apply techniques to a compliant partner. Generally nice material though.

-The cane and dan bong material was very short although I like the dan bong drill.

-The knife defense wasn't particularly impressive and the defender showed very little or no control of the weapon and only defended against long telegraphed lunges for the most part.

-The gun defense seemed okay although in some spots the defender brought the barrel in front of himself as he twisted and turned the opponent around.

-The women's techniques seemed like a quick add on and was composed mainly of throws, many of which seemed to allow the smaller woman to propel the opponent using quick and easy grabs. Not exactly the material I'd teach for a smaller opponent to use against a large one.

Overall, I wasn't as impressed with volume 2 as I was with volume 1. Volume 2 has the feel of an extended demo video with much more compliant partners and ""flashy"" techniques. It is nice in its diversity of material although it could have been better organized. I'd recommend this volume on those merits though especially since the price is fairly low and as part of set it makes a nice catalog for Hapkido techniques.",1194220800,2,3343,4.878306878306878
8004739,5,B0000YWQZI,"Hapkido Essentials and the two Hapkido Self Defense volumes are great for technique review.  These products are good for those individuals that are now training or having had some previous experience in Hapkido or other similar Korean martial arts. It is difficult to see the hand positions for many of the techniques. Other than that you will see super rolling, throwing, blocking, locking, rotation, and flexion.",1188172800,,414,5.2727272727272725
8004740,4,B0000YWQZI,"I once wrote a harsh review of the ""Hapkido Vol. 1"", the videotape made by Lee Chang Soo and the Jin Jung Kwan hapkido demonstration team. I stand by the criticisms of that video.

It was therefore a completely unexpected surprise to me that this DVD produced by the same people would be so well done in contrast to the earlier video series.

The filming is far superior. We are shown each technique approximately 3 times; normal speed, slowly, normal speed and we are given a little information session about every 5 techniques or so to bring attention to a fine point. It is very clear visually and impressively performed.

The weak point of the earlier series was that things were presently unrealistically and at such a speed that one could not hope to understand what was going on technically or even sometimes catch what technique was performed. This is not the case at all here. Although there is a great number of techniques presented here approximately 100 if memeory serves. quite a bang for the buck.

This is not a video for someone who has never practised hapkido or another jointlocking based martial art. Rather it is an interesting overview the curriculum of self defense techniques of what was previously one of the more important Korea Hapkido Federation schools. (They have since separated and formed their own federation.)

If you study hapkido this could be a great tool for you to have to assist you in jarring the old memory banks concerning the details of an art with a truly vast curriculum.

This video does not teach you the techniques and really one should not really be attempting to learn an martial art from a videotape anyway. However the videotape could have had a lot more detailed and better quality narration to bring a greater understanding of the fine points of the techniques. If you had the sound turned off you would lose nothing in terms of insight regarding this video. This holds this DVD back from scoring more highly.

Where this DVD really scores is in the execution and breadth of the techniques displayed. They are performed by Kim Myung Yong one of the senior-most hapkido teachers around.

If you train hapkido and you are looking for something to suppliment you knowledge of the wide hapkido curriculum this DVD will be just the ticket. If you don't study hapkido but have trained in jointlocking and throwing arts before you will find much of interest on this DVD. If you are thinking about trying to learn techniques from media this is definitely not the item for you.

I think that others who may dislike this DVD are probably people who would dislike hapkido or any other martial art which relies heavily on jointlock and throwing responses to self defense situations such as aikido, Japanese jujutsu, judo or Chinese Chin Na. If hapkido is your thing than this is the thing is for you.

This and Master Jung Tae's ""Ultimate Hapkido"" series are the strongest videos available thus far on the Korean art of hapkido.",1167868800,4,2970,4.749514563106796
8004741,5,B0000YWQZI,"these techniques will work in real life situations when appropriately applied.  those who criticize the moves as ""fantasy"" or ""fiction"" do so only in ignorance.  while the techniques are sometimes hard to see, if you have experience in the martial arts and hap-ki-do, this series will definitely be of help to you.",1121126400,2,314,5.019230769230769
8004742,5,B0000YWQZI,This DVD is one out of an outstanding series produced on Hapkido. This is probably one of the best on the subject. It shows a variety of techniques from a variety of angles.,1111363200,,173,4.2727272727272725
