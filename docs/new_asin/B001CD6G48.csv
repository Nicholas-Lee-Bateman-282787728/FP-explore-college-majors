8286822,4,B001CD6G48,"WWE is about to release another ""Tagged Classics"" release.  Just like their previous pairings, there's some good and some bad.  This is actually a pretty easy review to write:

""BAD BLOOD 2003 is average, but VENGEANCE 2003"" is awesome!""

That about sums it up.  But if you want more detail than that, here's my two cents:

*  BAD BLOOD 2003
---RAW's first exclusive PPV wasn't received very well back 5 years ago.  But oddly enough, everyone seems to have a different opinion on where this card went wrong.  The Redneck Triathlon - a trio of ""competitions"" between RAW GMs Stone Cold Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff - is dumb comedy.  Some people find it to be a guilty pleasure, while others think it was ridiculous waste of time.  The Hell-In-A-Cell main event pitting Kevin Nash against World Heavyweight champion Triple H (with Mick Foley as referee) has been called one of the worst, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  Goldberg's best WWE match was arguably against Chris Jericho on this very night.  Some of us were thoroughly entertained with the match, but nay-sayers still aren't impressed.  The only part where most fans seem to agree is Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair's impressive one-on-one affair.  While not as emotional as their WRESTLEMANIA 24 showdown, the action is just as entertaining.  But even though I think your reasons will be different than mine, I don't think BAD BLOOD 2003 is anything to go out of your way to see.

*  VENGEANCE 2003
---SMACKDOWN's first brand-exclusive PPV, on the other hand, is an oustanding card from start to finish.  The opener pits Eddie Guerrero against Chris Benoit for the new United States Title; what results is a 20-minute wrestling clinic that has all the ingredients of a classic (slow build-up, comedy, false finishes, etc.).  John Cena may have gotten a title shot months earlier, but I think this grudge match against The Undertaker was more a push.  A good showing from both men, indeed.  The triple threat main event features Big Show, Kurt Angle, and Brock Lesnar (WWE champion) in a wild, fast-paced showdown.  While not the best match on the card (in my opinion), all three men looked like championship material.  Even Vince McMahon has a decent match against the one-legged Zach Gowen.  If for no other reason, just watch Vince take one of the bloodiest chairshots in recent memory - it's priceless!  But the greatest gift from VENGEANCE 2003 is what I consider to be the greatest Tag Team Match of all time!  Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin defend their WWE Tag Team Titles against Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman in a flawless presentation.  It's filled with high-risk spots and incredible athleticism.  I can't think of any reason to dislike the match.  Not.  One.  Reason.

OVERALL
---Now that I'm done drooling over VENGEANCE 2003, my recommendation is that you should only buy this combo if you're very - and I mean ""VERY"" - interested in BAD BLOOD 2003.  If you're just curious, then skip this set and pick up the individual VENGEANCE DVD.",1217721600,2,3019,4.809338521400778
8286823,3,B001CD6G48,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released.  And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events.  These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

RAW's Bad Blood:
The next stage of the brand extension took place starting at this PPV as this was the first of the brand only PPV's (not including the U.K. PPV's) where only members of the brand roster would appear on the show. Stone Cold Steve Austin & Eric Bischoff at this time were co-General Managers of RAW & decided to have a contest against each other throughout the show known as the ""Redneck Triathlon"" where they would face off in three different events throughout the night from a burping contest to a ""pie"" eating contest & finally what was suppose to be a singing contest but turned into ""pig pen fun."" Mick Foley returned to the WWE for the first time in over 18 months to officiate the Hell In A Cell match between World Champion Triple H & Kevin Nash that got so violent that even Foley himself was busted open. 5 years before their more famous match at WrestleMania 24, Ric Flair faced off against Shawn Michaels in a match that was real good but limited to what they could do due to time restraints. Goldberg went out to settle an old score with Chris Jericho dating back to their days from WCW where again it was as good as it possibly could be with how limited Goldberg was in the ring. Other matches saw World Tag Team Champions Kane & Rob Van Dam vs. La Resistance where Kane was clearly more distracted by what happened with Steve Austin earlier in the week, Booker T returning to his hometown vs. Intercontinental Champion Christian, Scott Steiner vs. Test in a match for Stacy Keibler's managerial services, and Dudley Boyz vs. Rodney Mack & Christopher Nowinski.

SmackDown's Vengeance:
Just like how Bad Blood was the first RAW only PPV, Vengeance is the first SmackDown exclusive PPV. The main event was a triple threat against the three men who all have been having issues with each other for close to a year now in WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defending against Kurt Angle & Big Show in what has gone down as one of my favorite triple threat matches of all time full of non-stop action. The finals of the WWE United States Championship Tournament occurred between two long time friends/rivals in Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit giving you the match you would expect from them as far as technical wrestling. John Cena celebrated his first year on SmackDown by challenging Undertaker in a battle of respect that showcased a side of Cena that's not seen as much in times with him targeting & focusing on a body section of Taker causing internal injuries throughout the match. Other matches include Vince McMahon vs. the one legged Zach Gowen, Stephanie McMahon vs. Sable, Jamie Noble vs. Billy Gunn, an APA Invitational Bar Room Brawl featuring the rest of the SmackDown roster along with some surprises from the Los Conquistadores to the Easter Bunny (yes, you read that right), and the match that stole the show in WWE Tag Team Champions World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman.

In the end, if your looking for quality then your best bet is to try to find a copy of Vengeance at a cheaper price but if you can't then go ahead & grab this one.",1217548800,2,3480,4.57051282051282
