8138666,1,B00000F1M3,As a photographer I can not remember the last time I sat on the beach in my bathrobe during a shoot. If I acted as this guy does in his instructional video I am sure I would be sued or thrown in jail for abusing animals. This work is a travesty and a mockery to photographers.,1010448000,,276,3.9464285714285716
8138667,1,B00000F1M3,"As a college professor who has taught various levels of photography since 1981 I have seen a lot of videotapes on photography of various types, and I don't recall anything as bad as this videotape. The only reason I keep the  videotape at all is to show it as an example of how NOT to do a videotape  or go about a photo shoot.  The segment with the sea-turtle was disgusting  and uncalled for.  If this tape is purchased for the sole purpose of  gawking at nude women then it might be ok, but if the intent is to actually  learn something about photography, save your money and look elsewhere.  Professor Larry J. Howard Eastfield College",956188800,20,639,4.448275862068965
