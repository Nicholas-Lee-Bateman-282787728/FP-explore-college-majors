7994333,5,B00009Y3V0,"This is an excellent performance by our Mexican Diva Dolores del Ro with an other great actress, the Argentine Libertad Lamarque. This movie is always watched on TV, at least in Mexico, every May 10, during the Mother's Day. It is a strong drama between two women and a son of one of them or may I say the same son for two mothers ?. This DVD is a treasure for Del Ro's collectors or fans. Don't miss it !",1221177600,,405,4.075
7994334,1,B00009Y3V0,"Too bad this movie didn't get the proper transfer it deserves. There are scenes that are so blurry one can't make out their faces. Two of Mexican Cinemas biggest stars, a tearjerker movie, great songs by Lamarque. A crappy transfer. Maybe Mexicos Televisa will take it on and do it justice.",1123200000,4,290,4.705882352941177
