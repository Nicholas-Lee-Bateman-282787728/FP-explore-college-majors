8373711,4,B002M9WW6M,"I've watched everything except Honeymoon In Vegas only because the premise as stated on the DVD cover sounds preposterous and a little bit offensive.

However, the other three movies range from good to all-out excellent. Moonstruck definitely has the most solid script and the best ensemble cast. Cage may have some of the best lines in the movie. Leaving Las Vegas has Cage's Oscar-winning performance. Cage, co-star Elizabeth Shue, and director Mike Figgis avoid all sentimentality and deliver a story that is compassionate yet tough-minded.

My only quibble might be with Valley Girl. This movie has an impressive pedigree because it was made by a group of people who had professional ties with Francis Ford Coppola and his Zoetrope Studios. For a low budget movie shot in 20 days for about $325K, I have to give director Martha Coolidge, her actors, and her crew lots of credit. As for Cage, I'm not gay but seeing him here in all of his buff, youthful glory made me a little jealous. Even in my late teens, I never looked as good as he does here.

But, but...beneath all of its surface glitter, Valley Girl is too much a product of its time to have enduring value. Watching it now, I felt like it was a well-made piece of opportunism--a product tailored to satisfy the trends of its time rather than the expression of a viewpoint about 80's culture.

The visual and sound quality of the transfers of these DVDs is acceptable, but unexceptional.

The bottom line: If you like these movies and you can find this 4-pack for a good price, buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1421539200,,1574,4.709090909090909
8373712,5,B002M9WW6M,Really it doesn't get any better than pop'n your collar and watching the planet's greatest actor ever. I send this collection out as a wedding gifts because I want people to get the gift that keeps on giving millions of views down the road. What is better than one Nick Cage movie? Multiples. How easy was that math. I clicked 5 stars three times because Nick Cage is the rage.,1403222400,,377,4.4
8373713,5,B002M9WW6M,"I don't care what anyone says (and I know how I come off saying that) but I am a big Nic Cage fan. This is a prime piece for any Nic Cage fans out there. I haven't watched all four yet but this set is worth every cent even just for Leaving Las Vegas, arguably  Cage's best film. Great deal on some great movies.",1360627200,2,311,3.859375
