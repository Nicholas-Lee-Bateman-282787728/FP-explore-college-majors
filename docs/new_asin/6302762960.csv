507734,3,6302762960,"The DVD is ok, seems to get dull and boring after a few minutes. I watched the original series but watching it now seems dumb!",1236211200,,126,4.08
507735,4,6302762960,"All the material on this disk plus more is contained in the three-disk Definitive Collection which at the time of this writing is in print, available on Amazon, and very inexpensive (especially through 3rd-party sellers). What the D.C. lacks is any printed material that might be included with this Anchor Bay release.
Mr. Bill, BTW, seemed a lot funnier to me during his SNL run (this seems to be the general consensus), but even with hindsight, I'd probably still purchase the D.C., if only for an inexpensive trip down Memory Lane. Rating reflects the material, which I have seen, and not this particular release, which I haven't.",1152748800,9,633,4.925233644859813
507736,4,6302762960,"When they started out, the Mr. Bill shorts were a clever satire of bad childrens animation (that is, until they started taking themselves too seriously and became bad animation. See: ""Mr. Bill Does Vegas."") More to the point, those two minute segments of poor, play-dough Mr. Bill getting slaughtered by Mr. Hands and Sluggo were pretty dang funny.
The DVD image is fairly grainy and at some points can be quite poor. However, they still looks substantially better than the early TV broadcasts, and much better than the previous ""Best of SNL: Mr. Bill"" video. Among the numerous extras (games, Mr. Bill intro, Storyboards, Booklet, New Shorts, G-Rated Versions) the best is the commentary by Mr. Bill and Mr. Hands. As in the commentary on the ""This is Spinal Tap"" disc, it's a funny satire of the normal, boring commentary track.",1044403200,5,830,4.8936170212765955
507737,4,6302762960,"This tape is more of a ""must have"" for Jerry Seinfeld fans or diehard SNL fans. For others, you may want to think twice before spending good money on this one. That is only because of the length, a mere 32 minutes (and that includes the video company's opening credits). The comedic skits and comedy bits are very good. I believe this originally aired in 1992, a couple of years BEFORE the TV show ""Seinfeld"" hit its prime. Jerry's fans will like this tape a lot. Especially the ""Superman"" sketch and the ""game show"" sketch (where the contestants answer questions, using Jerry's trademark delivery style). Again, if you're a fan of anything ""Seinfeld,"" grab it while you can. It already seems like a collector's item to me. If you're an SNL fan, be aware that the only skits on this tape (except for the opening bit, before the monologue) are the ones in which Jerry appear. The episode's other skits are not included. For fans of both Seinfeld and SNL, definitely purchase it.",1024444800,10,977,4.6531791907514455
507738,4,6302762960,"If you can still get your hands on this one, do it.  This features Jerry at his younger comedian days along with the talented crews at Saturday Night Live.  See how his nothingness evolved into His Royal Nothingness.",1010448000,2,216,4.657894736842105
507739,2,6302762960,"The ""Mr. Bill"" short films are as bizarrely endearing as ever, but the DVD is a disaster.  (Note that all the earlier reviews are for the VHS tape.)
Here's the rub: ***ALL*** scanning and skipping functions are disabled throughout the entire disc!  Want to go to  the next film? Don't press the skip button; it won't work.  You have to go back to the tedious menu and arrow your way slowly to the episode you want.  Want to back up or fast forward a little in the film you're watching?  Sorry, but there's  no way AT ALL to do that.
This disc is a cruel joke and should be withdrawn. It cannot be recommended at all as issued, though I found it impossible to give poor Mr. Bill only one star....",995500800,47,695,4.259541984732825
507740,5,6302762960,"You may feel bad laughing at the sufferings of the benevolent, upbeat Mr. Bill, but you can't help it.  This is as funny as anything ever seen on SNL.  Although the video is less than an hour long, it packs more laughs  than some of the best comedy movies.  I highly, highly recommend this.",950572800,7,290,4.314814814814815
7830633,5,6302762960,Just as I remember it! I am very satisfied with my purchase. I got it before the time it said,1501977600,,93,3.7
7830634,5,6302762960,I always enjoyed watching the Mr. Bill segments on SNL and sometimes allowed my son to stay up late to watch.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son(now all grown up) thinking it would be a trip down memory lane.,1482278400,,219,4.093023255813954
7830635,5,6302762960,Very funny.  Brings back good memories!,1455321600,,39,5.5
7830636,1,6302762960,"don't like the fact that these are censored for children that means they took all the good s*** out I already own disaster piece so I guess I won't be needing this one and as far as I know those were not edited wish I never bought this sucks with the editing,should be some warning on the cover that these are edited skits",1434672000,,322,4.126984126984127

7830639,5,6302762960,"Who wouldn't love Mr. Bill.  This is a great compilation of some of the great Mr. Bill classics, and we were laughing out loud!!",1354752000,,128,4.333333333333333
7830640,5,6302762960,What a classic. My favorite sketch is Mr. Bill Goes To Court. Especially when there was a change in the testimony about Mr. Bill and Mr. Bill's own mother turned against him. Way to funny. Her line after they roughed her up was; Mr. Bill has been a very very naughty boy and has committed many felonies. Now that I just about had a heart attack from laughing so hard. I wonder after all these years why this is still not available on DVD. Mr. Bill's Greatest Hits. Just too funny.,1342137600,2,480,4.285714285714286
7830641,5,6302762960,Liked it.  So did my kids.  Funny watching their reaction to something from the past.  The choices of the episodes to include were the right ones.,1319414400,,146,4.538461538461538
7830642,4,6302762960,"Mr Bill is a little clay man with a little yellow dog. (Here comes Mr. Bill's dog)  He has terrible luck whenever his friend, Mr. Hand, comes around.  Mr. Sluggo is another clay man.  Whenever Mr. Bill sees Mr. Sluggo, he claims ""He's gonna be mean to me"", and he's always right.  Mr. Bill was well known in the late 1970s.  This started out as a little short skit on Saturday Night Live.  It caught on, and the little skits turned into a saga.  In the lat 1970s young adults were always quoting ""OH NO-O-O"" and everyone knew what they were talking about.  Even now kids enjoy sympathizing with Mr. Bill and his bad luck, and even teenagers get a kick out of it.  Adults will enjoy the memories.",1288051200,,695,4.325581395348837
