6993181,5,B00SVBVE0K,"La Favorite has been long overdue in the DVD/Blu ray recordings. There is a much older version, made in Japan, if memory serves, but the disc quality is poor. Recordings on CD in both the French and Italian versions have been my go to discs when the need to experience this marvelous score occurred. But now it is here and what an exceptional performance and recording it is! In the HD MA sound, the orchestral detail and vocal intensity come across splendidly. Starting  with the overture, there is virtually no letup in the quality of the recording.

Kate Aldrich's first DVD was as Amneris is an intimate setting of Aida in the tiny Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Busetto where the vocal and dramatic talents Aldrich has were immediately obvious. The same is true of the ROF's Zelmira, where her ability to handle fiendish coloratura was a hugely pleasant surprise. Leonor, the mistress of the king referenced in the title is a more dramatic role, yet one with extreme vocal  demands. The main mezzo aria, O mon Fernand is a most demanding piece, which Aldrich excecutes flawlessly, including the cabaletta repeat, which is frequently omitted.

My enthusiasm for Yijie Shi started with the ROF Mose in Egitto and reached manic proportions with the more recent L'Italiana in Algerie, also from the ROF. It is a lyric voice, but one with power and intensity. His first act aria contains a high C which he hits squarely, but does not hold, wisely managing his resources. His fourth act aria also has a high C which he extends a bit, But deapite the demands of a score which has him onstage singing a lot, he exhibits no signs of fatigue. His is a very exciting performance.

Ludovic Tessier as Alphonse XI, while not my favorite baritone, does extremely well, both vocally and dramatically, and his reactions to being told by the Church to mend his ways, is very convincing.

Parts of this performance constitute riveting drama, something that does not always occur in opera. The finale to the second act is one such, as is all of the last act, which Toscanini referred to as ""perfect"".

Disc quality, as noted, is flawless, especially as to the sound in the HD MA mode.

For lovers of Bel Canto in general or Donizetti, is particular, this disc is an essential buy.",1429488000,6,2260,4.703797468354431
6993182,5,B00SVBVE0K,"An excellent presentation of a masterpiece and a triumph for Kate Aldrich!

This is the first commercial video of Le Favorite, and it makes a strong case for the opera. The opera is prime Donizetti, with many memorable scenes if with fewer extractable arias. The lead, for bel canto mezzo, is the reluctant mistress of Alfonse XI,  Leonor, who loves a heroic military leader in the King's army.

Her main scena ""O mon Fernand"", one of Donizetti's greatest, has a long arc from longing to defiance, and Kate Aldrich has the full measure of it, with voice and skill to match any.

The conceit involves Fernand's elevation and his need for honor and respect, set against jealous and sabotaging courtiers, while the King under Papal pressure, ""gives"" his dishonored mistress to Fernand, who asks her as his reward, only to learn of her past, resulting in his disillusionment and return to monkhood.

The primary singers are excellent although Tezier (Alfonse XI) is a bit wayward on pitch, but a strong, convincing baritone. The Fernand, Yijie Shi is a clear high tenor without idiosyncrasies and has the size to hold his own in ensembles. Antonello Allemandi provides excellent orchestral support. The Balthasar, Giovanni Furlanetto, alone has a true ""French School"" sound, more in line with recordings from a century ago when it was quite popular.

The disc automatically starts in 5.1 sound and I found that the orchestra was close but the vocalists often drowned out. When I set the player to ""stereo"" and let the receiver synthesize there was a better vocal presentation. Due to the use of body mics, there was little sense of the space in the sound, and the core of the voices was not well enough balanced with some distrortion. Of course, this is much easier in the studio than on an open stage, and I would not forego the powerful video element of the presentation. See if ""stereo"" works better on your system.

The staging is effecting though minimal, the womens' costumes are best overlooked, Aldrich's shapeless one still look like they were massively taken in. Christian Lecroix missed the boat here.
Fortunately, the singing and the writing trumps all.

Despite the listed timing, it's about 2.5 hours, plus an interesting bonus feature of 40 minutes. The ballet is not given, but it can be found on the excellent audio recording from 1999 by Kasarova and Vargas, also recommended. Marilyn Horne made a powerful recording of Leonor's scena, that also shows what a gem Aldrich is.

I hope these minor reservations will encourage additional presentations and videos of this opera. It is deserving of greater currency, and I certainly hope it's on Bryan Hymel's list in the future.",1429315200,8,2687,4.913907284768212
6993183,5,B00SVBVE0K,"There are any number of Donizetti operas to choose from that deal with similar sentiments, but for sheer overwhelming swooning romanticism, La Favorite - the composer's 1840 four act French Grand Op&eacute;ra - is hard to beat. Performed in its original French version in the intimate location of the Th&eacute;tre du Capitole in Toulouse, it's given a simply gorgeous production here under the direction of Vincent Boussard that matches the warmth and the sweeping beauty of Donizetti's score and arrangements.

La Favorite has all the necessary qualities that enable such a deep, romantic treatment. It's an epic romance between a former monk and a mysterious lady, an impossible love with a historical context increasing the stakes that involves the king, threatens the very fate of the nation and even has the Pope getting involved. Whether it's a reflection of the composer writing specifically for a French audience to a French libretto, or whether it's evidence of a growing maturity in his writing, La Favorite is a more substantial work from Donizetti. There's less of the wild contrivance and heightened emotions of bel canto singing here, the French grand op&eacute;ra giving the composer the opportunity to adopt a more sombre tone that explores the fatalistic nature of the drama.

The subject and the treatment of it here mean that the opera works almost in abstraction as a study of guilt and betrayal, but the vivid score is tied closely to the drama, which is similarly well-constructed and developed even as it elevates the highly romantic situations and fervent declarations. There is however a stronger dramatic inclination shown in the writing that is closer to Bellini and it's not hard to see that the work would form a model for many of Verdi's historical romances, even bearing comparison to Don Carlos (not coincidentally also a work written for a French audience) or at least La Forza del Destino.

Directed by Philippe Boussard, this is an extraordinarily beautiful production of La Favorite. The sets and the stage are left fairly bare, almost abstract, with only really a few silhouetted arches in the background, yet much is done with light, colour and with elegant costumes designed by Christian Lacroix. With reflective surfaces and shimmering costumes, the stage is awash with crepuscular colours and luminous light. As well as looking terrific, the stage setting gives all the space and ambience required to set the essential mood and character of the piece. The melodrama practically demands that the characters in La Favorite express their feelings as if their lives depended on it, and the cast here sing it much the same way.

Although he doesn't speak the language, Yijie Shi handles Donizetti in French just as well as he does for the Rossini Italian repertoire, his lovely light lyrical tone just perfect for this work. Kate Aldrich gives an intense account of the opera's mezzo-soprano leading role as L&eacute;onor, again with good facility for the French language and with great dramatic impact. Ludovic T&eacute;zier's baritone is as smooth as ever as Alfonse, sounding very comfortable in the role, even as he exudes the menace or at least the threat to the happiness of the unfortunate couple, but T&eacute;zier ensures that there is sympathy too for his regal dilemma. This is just ideal casting. Conducting the Toulouse orchestra, Antonello Allemandi weaves purposefully through the rich and varied moods of the score, with a lightness of touch that belies the force of the dramatic tone.

It is an absolute joy that this splendid production has been recorded so well and presented so impressively in High Definition. Visually, the production is a wash of subtle colouration, and it's handled marvellously in the transfer with terrific detail, clarity and definition in the low-lit scenes. The audio tracks are also fine, allowing you to hear the detail in Donizetti's scoring for this work. The BD includes a 38-minute collection of interviews with the main cast, Allemandi, Boussard and Christian Lacroix. The BD is all-region, subtitles are in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.",1426032000,19,4142,5.157738095238095
8699403,2,B00SVBVE0K,"Third rate indeed. The singing is good but from international soloists so it should be. Tezier noticeably lacks any commitment and whilst Mr Shi has a  fine voice it is without colour and character. The sound quality is good. Those are the good things. The costumes are just dire. Cheaply made and faintly ridiculous bordering on hideous. They appear to have been made by an amateur sewing group. The sets are minimal and to me meaningless. The whole whole production is ""stand and deliver"" in stye and the minimal acting by Mr Shi is frankly abysmal. Very much a mediocre performance by a provincial opera house - to be viewed once then pass on the disc to the charity shop as you won't bother to watch it again.",1513209600,,713,4.5703125
8699404,3,B00SVBVE0K,"I made it my objective to see just about every opera commercially available by the big composers such as Donizetti. The risk is small considering the price now of operas on DVD. With 200 operas in my library it is difficult to rate this above a 3. To the more educated they somehow see a five star performance. I read everyone's review, and have to admit the I am more in alignment with the 2-3 star ratings. The video and audio quality are excellent. The opera itself is not memorable if we were to compare it to Donizetti's other works. But if you want to experience all of Donizetti please get it; I intend to get all of his works on DVD. But understand this is not one of his masterpieces. Leonor and Fernand are not well matched; the age difference appears to be about 20 years with virtually no love chemistry. Costuming is poor and staging non-existent; versus the polite ""economical"" or minimal sets.",1475366400,,908,4.509090909090909
8699405,2,B00SVBVE0K,"I beg to differ with my predecessors' reviews. True, apart from the old VAI recording with Alfredo Kraus which is in poor condition, this is indeed the ""only game in town"" on DVD or Bluray, And since I like Kate Aldrich and Ludovic Tezier, I bought the Bluray version.

A great disappointment. Let's start with the voices. Kate Aldrich is okay, but nothing to write home about. With a better cast/director she could do better. Ludovic Tezier, one of my favorite baritones , -his soul wasn't in it. Pity! Giovanni Furlanetto, makes an impressive appearance but is totally out of his depth with lower notes.

The interesting voice is of the young Chinese tenor. He has a good voice, but -alas- does not know anything about acting. Worse, he is the ""lover"" of Kate Aldrich, who looks and acts like his MOTHER.

I would like to know about the desgner of the clothes- was he drunk or did use some substance? I have never seen such ridiculous clothes worn in a cloister, monastery or royal palace. The scene was incredible as well.  A shining floor strewn with flower petals in all three locations, a large mirror, a stuffed peacock and some -badly-drawn arches. No cloister, no palace, no alcazar, nothing.
Waing for a more serious production.

Purchaser, beware ! Caveat emptor!

8699406,5,B00SVBVE0K,"I decided to buy this DVD because the reviews were very good. I didn't know this opera, only that it was composed by Donizetti. All the combination of areas ensembles and chorus with the beautiful music makes this opera a good example of Belcanto.
The cast is outstanding; I knew Kate Aldrich and Ludovic Tezier from previous performances. Their singing and acting were very convincing playing Leonor de Guzman, La Favorite and Alphonse XI, King of Seville. On the other hand Yijie Shi who was new for me was impressive: He was able to sing without knowing the language and learned the lyric so well that he was able to reflect very well the complexity of his role.
The scenery was very simple. The lighting and use of mirrors was very effective enhancing the drama.
The direction was very good.
I enjoyed this performance as well as the interviews with the cast.",1438905600,,863,4.684210526315789

8699408,4,B00SVBVE0K,"The reason I did not give this DVD 5 Stars as it may deserve on its own merit, is that it simply can't compete with the Metropolitan Opera production of ""La Favorita"" I saw a long time ago with my daughter, starring Fiorenza Cossotto, Luciano Pavarotti, Gabriel Bacqiuer and Nicolai Ghiaurov, all in their prime. Simply nothing could ever compare to that. Too bad that it was never recorded on DVD and exists only on CDs. Ever since I have been steeped in the Italian version of which I know practically every word of every aria.
So, to start with, although I do speak French, I find it a bit confusing to listen to its older French cousin. (The same actually happens to me with the original French ""Don Carlos"" when it is the Italian ""Don Carlo"" I have internalized over the years.)
However, we are discussing here ""La Favorite"" and I did like very much what I saw and heard. The production was simple but adequate, the costumes were lovely and the singers definitely did not disappoint. They were well worth listening to throughout.
Yes, the illuminated suitcase was ridiculous and Mr. Shi was not exactly the heroic figure preferable for this role but his voice was lovely and his judgment in not trying to hold on to notes that he reached just fine, was excellent.
Altogether, I passed a lovely afternoon enjoying this DVD and considered it time well spent.",1437955200,,1361,4.628099173553719
8699409,5,B00SVBVE0K,Great opera. Only fair non-traditional production. Only modern DVD of this as far as I know. Wanted thid opera either in Italian or french for a long time. Singers are very good.,1433203200,,178,4.59375
8699410,4,B00SVBVE0K,"La Favorite was written in French by Donizetti to a libretto by Royer and Vaez (with additions by Eugene Scribe) for the Opera Paris in 1840. The unauthorized Italian version, La Favorita unfortunately is the one that was the popular favorite in the nineteenth even if awkward Italian dialog is badly fit into French meter music. Just listen to the smooth French lines of King Alphonse in his great Act II aria ""Vien Leonor"" as beautifully executed here by French baritone Ludovic Tezier. Leonor de Guzman, the favorite,  is exquisitely sung by Kate Aldrich, a noted Rossini bel canto mezzo whose Act III ""O mon Fernand"" is breathtaking. The young monk and object of her ardor is played by Chinese tenor Yijie Shi. He sings well but unfortunately when he is sharing the stage with his beloved Leonor (Ms Aldrich), they look like mother and son.
The production is from a 2014 performance at the Theatre du Capitole in Toulouse France. It is a small intimate 1200 seat theater just the right size and acoustics for an intimate drama. The staging is colorful with clever use of lights, shadows and mirrors. The chorus is moved around well and effectively. The sets are simple, modern and somewhat provocative as the ragged peacock statues that appear here and there and the glowing yellow suitcase that is carried from set to set by Fernand. Meaning? Who knows! The costumes again were a bit of a mystery. Sometimes  nice and appropriate to the situation and at others they looked unfinished or just random scraps of material slapped on a passing chorister. The most bizarre one was Leonor last appearance  just before death in Act IV. She is encased in clothe with a large veil encircling her head and no sleeves. Movement is difficult and she looks something like a moth trying to escape from it's pupa. Oh well - it's all Regie-theatre these days! Anything goes.
Donizetti was a most prolific composer. He did something like 70 operas until the last stages of tertiary syphilis put him into an insane asylum where he died. Unlike Bellini who took time and care of each one of his works, Donizetti batted them out as fast as he could always under the pressure of a deadline as here if La Favorite. He was still working on some arias and the obligatory ballet (required at the Opera) just days before the opening. Some of the music came from other of his works, some not fitting so well in this new opera. He wrote ""L'ange de Nisida"" sometime earlier but it had not been staged. So he grafted on the story of Eleanor de Guzman to it for his La Favorite. A story set in 1340. Thus some parts of this opera are somewhat awkward and contrived. In other places he is truly brilliant as in the music of Act IV (which is mostly from L'ange de Nisida)..Thus I feel that La Favorite is a middle rung Donizetti. It is not the great pageantry or character delineation of Anna Bolena or Maria Stuarda or the other Tudor queen  series, nor the character brilliance of Lucia or the comedies L'elisir d'Amore or La Fille du Regiment.but it is one that deserves a reading now and then. This production is basicly fine and gives the opera a good show.",1430524800,5,3133,4.60931899641577
8699411,5,B00SVBVE0K,"La Favorite is rated as among Donizetti's finest. This is a well staged, well acted and well sung performance.  Only the leading Soprano is less than superb, and she is quite good.  It's a rather long opera, but time flew by watching it.  Highly recommended.",1430006400,2,258,4.688888888888889
8699412,5,B00SVBVE0K,"Although I prefer the Italian version of this beautiful opera, it was a pleasure to see this beautiful production of the original French version of the opera. All the major characters are in splendid voices, the sets are simple but adequate and the costumes magnificent except for Fernand's
in most of the opera. And what is the idea behind that ridiculous lighted yellow bag?
 It is good to have these French grand operas recorded, even if some productions, like Les Vepres Siciliennes are better in their Italian versions.
Robert Le Diable and the Covent Garden production of Les Troyens are spectacular productions. Saint-Saens ""Henry VIII"" production from Com-
piegne is a must It is a beautiful production with splendid singers and excellent music It is a pity that the St. Etienne production of Massenet's
""Le Mage"" was not recorded in video for problems with the orchestra. And what is wrong with Meyerbeer operas, once so famous and performed and now in oblivion.",1429660800,4,971,4.993827160493828
