8443993,3,B004VSZD3Q,"I bought this video  for my mother who has spinal stenosis.  It  is  very slow for me, but she likes it if I do it with her.  The movements are very gentle, but they do give a little workout.  It is very easy and will not stress anyone with balance issues or standing issues.  It is all done while sitting  in a chair.  It is good for people who are looking for an easy way  to circulate some blood without being too strenuous.",1410912000,,427,4.036144578313253

8443995,5,B004VSZD3Q,I have been in a wheelchair for 5 years due to Muscular Dystrophy. I have tried many types of exercises videos and this one is the best by far. It is slow enough to do comfortably and contains good stretching exercises.,1356480000,4,219,4.365853658536586
