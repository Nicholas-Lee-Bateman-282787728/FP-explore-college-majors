7979255,2,B0000844LA,"Again, the pictures on the front jacket of the DVD case, and to a large extent the written descriptions of the films on the back cover, have little or nothing to do with the actual films themselves.  For example, NONE of the characters pictured on the front cover appear in either of the films themselves.  This is patently false advertizing, and it ticks me off.

(1) Mantis Fist Boxer
This is actually ""Grand Master of Shaolin Kung Fu,"" but under a different name.  A decent story, with respectable fight choreography, but I already had the movie--on the (shudder) Telefilms release, which is actually a better transfer than the muddy, 4:3 Ground Zero release (the Telefilms release is clearer, not as cut and in widescreen).  So this was a needless duplication and therefore a waste of my money.

(2) Tiger from Canton
Same movie as The Chinese Tiger on the Saturn label--which I also already have!  The actors don't look Chinese in this film, maybe Malaysian, and few that are recognizable from other kung fu films.  The picture quality is mediocre and in 4:3, although the quantity and quality of kung fu action is respectable.

Another semi-klinker from the Brooklyn Zu division of Ground Zero, with its inconsistent and deceptively billed (and often only alleged) kung fu fare.  Make sure the renamed titles (Mantis Fist Boxer and Tiger from Canton) don't identify with films already in your library (Grand Master of Shaolin Kung Fu and The Chinese Tiger).",1124409600,5,1463,4.886639676113361
