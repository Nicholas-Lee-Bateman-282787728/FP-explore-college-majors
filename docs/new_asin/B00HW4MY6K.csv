8636815,5,B00HW4MY6K,I have always enjoyed the Bibleman videos.  I remember watching them when I was younger. These are great DVDs for children to learn biblical principles.  I think these would be awesome for young boys as bibleman is a super hero. This would make a great gift. What a wonderful addition to anyone's DVD library! I received this dvd from B&H bloggers.  A positive review was not required.  All opinions are my own,1483574400,,410,4.652777777777778
