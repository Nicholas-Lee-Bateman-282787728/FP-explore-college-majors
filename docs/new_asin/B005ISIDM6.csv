4709738,3,B005ISIDM6,"I wanted to learn how to do the Swing, and I wanted to do it properly, however I didn't want to be able to pass an exam on physiology before swinging. The ""instructions"" are good, but there is also far too much superfluous information which goes on and on and on, is repeated over and over and over, time and time and time again. Instead of holding my interest it drove me to skip ahead.

All that background could have been condensed and, along with the workouts, gone on a single DVD at a more reasonable price.",1355184000,7,513,4.288659793814433
4709739,4,B005ISIDM6,"This isn't a ""put on a workout DVD and go"" kind of thing. There is enough time to take notes, maybe even do the dishes in between performing the techniques.  That's a good thing. The DVD is ""Mastering the Hardstyle Kettlebell Swing"". Period.  If you are a beginner without a clue about kettlebell technique, this will get you a safe and effective start.  DVD #2 does have a rest/pause workout that can be challenging. The production, presentation and quality of the DVD is amateurish at best, and there is an irritating ""under"" sound that may be faint music, (but i really couldn't tell). The instruction is in-depth and technical, with some friendly banter added to lighten it up.
You WILL master the basic kettlebell swing by paying attention to the instruction and demos on this DVD. Depends on what you are looking for.",1344124800,24,823,4.741258741258742
4709740,4,B005ISIDM6,"I bought a kettlebell last year..but felt that book instruction on proper form and technique was not enough. I bought the dvd to enhance my training experience.  There are two dvds- one to learn how to do the swing by doing different drills and the other dvd is the workout dvd.  I am happy with my purchase.

I was surprised to find the dvd case damaged.  The plastic piece that holds the dvds in place were broken.  So the dvds  were loose and a little scratched.  But I checked to make sure the dvds would play without any problems.  And then I put them in a different case to store them.  I would have given 5 stars if the case was not damaged. I did not return the dvds since they played fine. I have been using the instructional dvd and must say the drills alone will make your hamstrings sore.  I love the fact that you can burn 100 calories in 5 minutes.  Awesome workout when you do not want to drive to the gym.",1329523200,7,921,4.176136363636363
4709741,5,B005ISIDM6,"If you're looking for an instructional DVD that shows how to safely and effectively perform the kettlebell swing--this DVD is the ticket. It's actually a 2 DVD set. The first disc breaks down the movements of the swing into a series of exercise drills to help you learn proper body mechanics--and it's a serious workout in itself. The second disc takes you through 2 separate kettlebell workouts, repeating many of the movements from the first disc. Both instructors are certified to teach the Russian Kettlebell (Mark Reifkind is Master RKC and Tracy Reifkind is RKC) and safety and proper form are emphasized again and again. The production is straightforward (no annoying background music, thank you), the movements are demonstrated from different viewing angles, and the instruction is clear, detailed, and very helpful. It's exactly what I was hoping for. (One quibble: The DVDs were rattling around inside the package I received because the case was damaged. They were a little scratched up as a result. No damage to the playback, however, so I'm keeping.)",1328918400,28,1062,5.109195402298851
4709742,5,B005ISIDM6,"So you can swing- now what? Build your training program....Tracy Style! Tracy Reifkind expertly demonstrates and explains the progression from  absolute beginner to accomplished athlete. Using her methods, you will experience and teach success with Kettlebell swing training. Tracy tells you  how to set and achieve goals and ""trick ""  your clients into doing more work than they thought possible. She shows how distraction from everything outside the body will  build a strong connection between mind and body.  This is not your typical Exercise DVD. You can't just ""show up"" for KB practice. The key to success is being engaged in your own body, setting achievable, measurable goals  and designing your own change. This video presentation is a valuable resource for anyone designing a Kettlebell swing program and we know it works. Just look at Tracy.

Well done Tracy! I am already looking forward to your next video.....you inspire me everyday!",1327968000,13,948,5.23841059602649
4709743,5,B005ISIDM6,"The Kettlebell Swing is 95% or higher as far as being better than all other exercises for developing strength and endurance. You can lose fat, increase strength, explosiveness, and hit both aerobic/anaerobic at the same time. If you think it is boring then you don't know the swing. All I can tell you is if you can swing the 48kg bell for multiple sets of 10-20 for 10 minutes you know what I am talking about. Tracy is outstanding and all her DVD's give numerous easy to follow along programs. To easy, go heavier and you will get what I mean. KB + DVD equals no monthly payment to a globo gym where people do the same thing over and over year after year and nothing changes. My motto is look at what everyone else is doing and do exactly the opposite.",1383609600,4,754,4.316901408450704
4709744,4,B005ISIDM6,Learned how to do the swing without hurting my back from this video. Extremely clear and detailed instructions.  Good for someone who wants to learn and had never used a kettlebell. I gave it 4 stars because I wish there would have been more workouts than the two beginner ones included.,1379289600,2,287,4.627450980392157
4709745,5,B005ISIDM6,"Mark and Tracy's KB swing focuses on the Kettlebell Swing.  If you have looked into Enter the Kettlebell, it focuses on the Swing, Turkish Get-up, Cleans, various Presses, and the Snatch.

While I am not a novice to RKC Kettlebell training, this DVD was a great addition to my knowledge on the Swing, and helped improve my form.",1378512000,2,328,4.637931034482759
4709746,4,B005ISIDM6,"I am a high intermediate exerciser who began using kettlebells about two years ago.  My only instruction has been through use of videos, both DVDs and online instructional clips.  Although in general, I felt fairly confident about basic skills, I thought that the only way to become more competent and advanced in kettlebells was to was to expose myself to a truly thorough instructional video such as this one.

MASTERING THE HARDSTYLE KETTLEBELL SWING is a two-disc set featuring Mark Reifkind, Master RKC, and his wife, Tracy Reifkind, a RKC trainer.  In the first disc, Mark serves as the chief instructor, completely breaking down various principles of the swing while Tracy provides additional information and often demonstrates.  Disc 2 features two short swing workouts, both led by Tracy.  I have provided additional information for each disc below (times are approximate).

DISC 1 CHAPTERS
*Introduction (5m).  Talks about kettlebell training and mentions how the swing was found to burn 20 calories per minute.
*Neutral Spine/Hip Hinge (6.5m).  Breaks down the difference between a squat and the hip hinge needed for swings.
*Hinge Corrections (9.75m).  Demonstrates use of a reclined leg stretch with a unique breath pattern as well us upward facing dog to get the feel of the hip hinge.
*Silverback Dead Lift (12m).  Shows how to lower down to the kettlebell; also makes starting weight recommendations for women (18 lbs or 8 kg).
*Diaphragmatic Breathing (10.5).  Demonstrates technique, including breath holds.
*Low Hover to Pendulum Swing (8m).  Focuses on how to work to activate the lat muscles with the kettlebell low.
*High Hover to Pendulum Swing (4.5m).  Practices swinging with the kettlebell above the knees.
*Hike Pass (11.5m).  Works on a back swing emphasis.
*Hike Swing Park (6.5m).  Teaches a single repetition of the swing.
*Parallel to Floor (8m).  Demonstrates how to stop the swing in a parallel position and also offers relaxation drills.
*The Plank (6.5m).  Provides instruction on moving from elbow plank to a static hold, activating the lats, raising into a high push-up, and performing scapular push-ups.

*Hip Flexor Stretches (3.75m).  Teaches static stretching in a kneeling lunge position and prone bridge with toes up.
*Face the Wall Squat (2m).  Shows how to practice maintaining a back arch by squatting with face to the wall.

DISC 2
*Workout 1 (39m)--For the first workout, Tracy is teaching, and she is joined by both Mark and her ""best friend,"" Fawn Friday, a Level 2 RKC instructor.  This workout moves slowly, as there is A LOT of rehash of the instructional portion--Tracy is gradually performing additional swings, but she is reviewing each concept as she does so.
*Workout 2 (26m)--Tracy leads this workout, again joined by Fawn.  She calls this routine ""swing training,"" with the goal of building up to equal work to equal rest.  Fawn begins following this pattern immediately (e.g., 20 swings, 20 seconds rest), but Tracy works up to it, starting with 10 swings and adding two at a time until 15, then one at a time.  She also includes one-hand swings in this workout, and she concludes with another set of two-hand swings.

For its stated purpose--i.e., ""mastering"" the swing--this is an excellent instructional set.  Mark and Tracy are both very pleasant (if a little bland, especially give the plain white set), with Tracy showing more of a sense of humor.  I did find them to get a little wordy at times; obviously, they have a lot of knowledge and wanted to share this with viewers, but given the DVD format, it may have been appropriate to be a bit more focused.  Similarly, although it was nice to have actual workouts included in this DVD set, there was a bit too much chatter in them (especially the first one), and they lacked a warm-up or cool-down, which made them feel incomplete.

Despite these issues, I would not hesitate to recommend this DVD set to anyone wanting in-depth instruction on swing technique.",1378339200,15,4322,5.083687943262412
4709747,5,B005ISIDM6,"Must own if you are a Kettlebell enthusiast. Progressions and Regressions were broken down perfectly. Great value.

I look forward to purchasing more products from Mark and Tracy Reifkind.",1375056000,2,188,5.482758620689655
4709748,5,B005ISIDM6,"I've been working out with kettlebells for 18 months, just started with a trainer and heavier bells (25 lbs for swings, 40 lbs for dead lifts).  I recently strained my lower back doing swings, couldn't figure out why.  ""Mastering the Hardstyle Kettlebell Swing"" provided detailed instruction on correct position and movement, breaking the move down incrementally, which allowed me to figure out what I did wrong, and how to correct it.  I've not seen any kettlebell DVD with this amount of specific, precise instruction, as well as the reasoning for it.  I appreciate that the Reifkinds took a lot of time and care to produce a DVD that's so focused.  if you want to learn how to swing safely, this is the DVD for you.  And, included is a second DVD of two swing workouts.  Totally worth the money.",1372636800,4,798,4.697841726618705
4709749,5,B005ISIDM6,"I got some kettlebells a while ago, and decided I could learn from youtube and other such sources, and I tried many of the ""free"" ways to learn.

If you already know the swing properly and maybe want to branch out, this is just fine and theres alot of it out there. However as a beginner, I was finding I was missing something, and getting a sore back more often then not. I was afraid my kettlebells would go the route of so many peoples ellipticals and treadmills and be another form of furniture.

I bought this and within a few segements found not only I was doing alot of things wrong, but suddenly the swing did not cause me back pain.

Some may say there is too much instruction here, and I can see where they are coming from, however I think if you are out to truly master the swing, too much is a good thing. No one says you have to go through it over and over, but its nice to have the reference to come back to until you get the muscle memory.

I will agree, it took some time to get through it, but in the end it was time well spent I think. Not only do they show you in detail the right way to do it, its also broken up in smaller segments so you can take ""bite size chunks"" of it if thats your style. They also demonstrate some wrong ways, I found that helpful as a point of reference as well.

if your interested in learning the swing, this will do it for you. if your interested in snatches, cleans, etc, you won't find that here.",1366070400,7,1446,4.059649122807017
4709750,5,B005ISIDM6,"I have purchased quite a few exercise/workout programs and while I have been generally pleased with the content of the programs, many seem to assume that you have a basic knowledge of what you are trying to learn from their programs and if I did not have this prior knowledge or experience, I would miss much of the basic parts of what they are trying to instruct or need to look at other resources for the missing details.

Mastering the Hardstyle Kettlebell Swing is on the other end of the spectrum with even the most subtle details of body position, breathing, muscle activation, etc all covered thoroughly with great coaching cues to help you remember these details as you put them to use.

I have to say that I have never even touched a kettlebell before and purchased my first at the same time as this DVD with the help of author Mark Reifkind contacting him through Facebook. Mark and his wife Tracy do a great job of breaking down the swing into bite size pieces that help you to safely learn the swing and perform it to it's full benefit. I feel I am making great progress already after just a few ""get acquainted"" sessions with the bell and swing.

This video is over three hours of not just great basics on learning the kettlebell swing, but also two different levels of workouts to follow along with. All in all, a great value and I would highly recommend.",1366070400,7,1369,4.48995983935743
4709751,5,B005ISIDM6,"I've been using this DVD to learn how to properly do the swing for little over a month (3x per week).  It contains all the information you need to know on how to do the swing properly and with out pain or aches.  There may be more info on the swing than you wanted to know, but to learn the swing properly (without going to an instructor) you need to know the information laid out in the instructional DVD.  Again, this DVD set was made for beginners or for people that have been doing the swing, but want to do it better.

I tried other DVDs and Videos, but they didn't go into as much detail, which lead me to do things wrong and have lower back issues. The instructions within this DVD helped be to learn the tips to doing the swing correctly and now I do not have back aches after doing the swing.  I really like the 1st workout on the workout DVD.  If you are new to swings, this will be a great starting workout.  There are just under 150 full swings in Workout #1.

It also includes a second workout. My only gripe is that after trying it, workout #2 seems to be a bit of a jump from workout #1.  You can just do two-hand swings along with workout #2, following the instructions in the beginning.  But it just seemed to be a bit advanced to me.  I know it is a workout that you ""do what you can"", but I still would have liked to see a workout (like the one linked below) that was a little more geared for beginners after Workout #1. I did not count the number of swings in Workout #2.

However, Tracy has an excellent On-the-Minute workout posted on her blog which I found and think to be a perfect bridge from Workout #1 to Workout #2.  Here is her blog post about that workout: [...]  I like this one as it is all two had swings, so I don't feel like I need to jump into some of the advanced swings.  The workout on her blog will contain 215-414 swings in 26 minutes, depending on where you are at. I was able to do 300 swings my first time doing it.

NOTE: If for some reason the Link above does not work, check out Tracy's Blog called ""Tracy Reifkind's Training Food and Thought"".  The blog post was posted on June 8th 2012 and is called ""Your Own Personal Trainer! Train along with me in true ""The Swing"" style!"".

It has been said (and I fully believe) this DVD is the closet thing to learning the swing you are going to get, without actually going to a RKC instructor.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in learning the swing.  Esp. if you are unable to get training from an RKC instructor.

I want to learn how it's really done, not some watered down big box gym version. As a lifelong horsewoman, I can tell you technique is the foundation of success. I can also tell you from hours of stacking 100lbs hay bales, I can easily see how KB should work. This video is exactly what you need. If you don't have access to a certified trainer of KB, as in RKC or similar certification, this video is the next best thing! Tracy and Mark do an excellent job of explaining things. I love the white background as it lets you see everything clearly - foot stance, how the swing progresses, everything without a busy background. A foundation of excellent technique = success.
