533701,3,6302999928,"For the second annual event, the WWF took its premier event to three different locations- New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.
Highlights of this event included a steel cage match between Hulk Hogan and King Kong Bundy, an NFL vs. WWF battle royal, a boxing match between Mr. T and Roddy Piper, and the interesting WM debut of the phenominal Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts.

533704,3,6302999928,"WrestleMania 2. Live from three different locations. If you think that that is an extremely stupid idea, well, I can't argue with ya'. This event is actually a little better than WrestleMania I, but it still isn't ""knock you off your feet"" good. It's just, good. Maybe OK. It would have been better if the original plan of Bret Hart vs. Ricky Steamboat went down. But then again, Hogan was facing King Kong Bundy in the main event anyway, so maybe not (Jesus H. Christ that was a horrendous match!). But this PPV does have Dynamite Kid, who F'n RULZ! If you have never seen this guy, then don't talk to me (like you would anyways). This guy is so far ahead of his time it's scary. This is a very mildly recommended PPV, but don't expect to be stupified or anything.",1004745600,,765,4.394366197183099
533705,2,6302999928,"The second WrestleMania is somewhat more entertaining than the original, but not very good.  In fact, it tries to live up to the original rather  than try to be better.  WrestleMania II is worth seeing once in a blue  moon.  Not a big disappoitment but very uninteresting.  You should see some  interesting matches as well as characters.",965088000,,337,4.807017543859649

Wrestlemania 2 was held in three different locations in one night.  Each location had their own  matches which would take place in succession with eachother.  The Los  Angeles Sports Arena, Chicago's Rosemont Horizon, and New York's Nassau  Coliseum were the venues used for Wrestlemania 2.  The main event was a  steel cage match for the WWF Title between Champion-Hulk Hogan and  Challenger-King Kong Bundy.

7834228,3,6302999928,"There's no question its an interesting experiance to see what Vince see's as improving his product each year for Wrestlemania. The talent, the stories seem somehow better than last years event, there's even a five star calibre classic featured between the tag champions the Dream Team and the British Bulldogs but when you add simpley horrible co main events like a boxing match with Piper versus Mr. T(a guy who has as much business in that ring as David Arquette did)and a twenty man battle royal featuring the NFL against Some of the greatest in pro wrestling, by the time your ready for the Cage match between Hogan and Bundy(which was average) you feel as though you must tear your eyes out for want of something entertaining to do with them.
Ricky Steamboat as always executes an entertaining contest against Hercules, his armdrags are simpley the stuff of ledgend and the Funk Brothers versus Tito Santana and Junkyard Dog got very hardcore before the WWF even had such a division in which to showcase such talent. Macho Man's match with the Animale had all the potential to be great but it wasn't and Muracco contest against Mr. Wonderful also had an unsatisfying conclusion but the real shocking performance came from a match featuring Jake The Snake against lowely jobber Gorge wells, it was short but good never the less.
The filming from three locations thing was inovative but didn't work out well(thats why they never did it again)with production and slowed the event down when it already was already reeling from a boxing match at a wrestling event, a battle royal that was totally unnecessary, a womens title match that was a squash and a cross dresser versus a country hillbilly whose name wasn't even Jim.
If you want my advice it would be much simpler just to skip most of the event and youtube the matchs that I talked about earlier, that tag title match is simpley awesome fans check it out, it saves this whole show!",1241481600,,1938,4.736686390532545
7834229,3,6302999928,"Paul Orndorff VS Don Muraco: The match was going good and it ended out of nowhere. Bullcrap and the team of Vince and Susan St James are unbearable.

Randy Savage VS George Steele: I love Macho Man, probably was the greatest wrestler of the 80's. Savage plays chicken for a few minutes and finally the match begins. An enjoyable match with anther stupid ending.

Jake Roberts VS George Wells: Who? George Wells? Whatever happened to this guy? Wells does a good job and Vinnie Mac says this is the toughest match of Roberts career thus far. Im surprised at Wells, even though Roberts wins in the end. Anyone know more information on George Wells?

Mr T VS Roddy Piper: The last match from New York and I skip it. Im watching wrestling, not boxing.

New York is over and was a complete waste of time, here comes Chicago.

Fabulous Moolah VS Velvet McIntyre: Kathie Lee does commentary? What the hell? This event is slipping into one of the worst ive ever witnessed and heard.

Corporal Kirschner VS Nikolai Volkoff: How much did people pay for this event? They got ripped off. This match was crap and the ending would be good if I cared about either wrestler.

NFL VS WWF Battle Royal: This is one of the moments they always display on WrestleMania rewinds. I don't care, skip.

There is way to many interviews and not enough good matches. Ive yet to see a match that i'd call classic.

Dream Team VS British Bulldogs: The more I watch old WWF, the more I like Greg Valentine. A great match but I hated the ending. Still, it's probably the best match of the whole event.

Hercules VS Ricky Steamboat: I thought how can this go wrong? Elvira is on guest commentator. She sucks, what the f*(& was WWF on with all these women commentators? A fairly good match with Steamboat winning in the end.

Adrian Adonis VS Uncle Elmer: Adonis is looking very, very, very gay and that is no joke. I just skipped this gay (no pun intended) match.

Anther interview, I think there is more interviews then matches.

Terry and Hoss Funk VS Tito Santana and Junkyard Dog: An enjoyable match with anther bad ending.

An eight minute recap of the Bundy-Hogan cage match. It made me want to watch the match even though the outcome was already known. Three stars for a few matches I saw that was good.

Hogan VS Bundy in a cage match: It was a typical 80's Hogan match. It was enjoyable but I wouldnt call it a classic.

Overall, a pretty bad event. The guest women commentators were a bad idea and its no wonder why they haven't done it since. I'll never watch this PPV ever again.",1235865600,,2557,4.466666666666667
7834230,2,6302999928,"An ok ppv. Like others have stated it is a pretty average ppv. The main problem with it, is that the matches are just far, far too short averaging about five to ten minutes each. The commentary wasn't too bad, but it seems like everything was rushed here with no big storylines to boot. This marks the first time as well they tried to split the Wrestlemania to three locations: Chicago, New York, LA.

Orndoff vs. Magnificent Muraco ** at best. This could have been a great match, and with Fuji on the outside, it could have been.

Savage vs. George ""The Animal"" Steele for IC Title *** -Their SNME  matches are still better but this isn't too bad. However it follows the same routines , Savage uses Elizabeth to gain the advantage then cheats to win. George then does his whole turnbuckle thing.

Rowdy Roddy Piper vs. Mr. T in a boxing match **- Allright at least this match had some buildup which the others hadn't. We see how this rivalry started with T and Piper. The boxing match is ok , Piper was approaching his prime here.

 Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts vs. George Wells **- Too bad for George, he actually dominates Jake for about three minutes and looks like he worked hard to get in shape. However since this is  a jobbing match, Jake pulls it out.

Jumping to the Chicago:  location we are now taken to the huge Battle Royal with WWF vs NFL Stars ***

It is a good one, lots of  faces here, not that bad of  a battle royal even the ""Fridge"" is in this one. The ending was predictable but it was a one time to see all the stars here.

British Bulldogs vs. Dream Team (Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine and Brutus ""The Barber"" Beefcake) *** and  . A great match and probably the longest one too. The Bulldogs finally get put over and this would to their memorable title reign and feuds with the Harts and others.

Cpl. Kirchner vs. Nikolai Volkoff **- Pure brawl with some wrestling, Similar Of their matches from 80's. Kirchner though I liked the gimmick and he could at least sell a match.

Velvet McIntyre vs. the Fabulous Moolah for the women's title *- Poor squash.

Ricky Steamboat vs. Hercules Hernandez **-Fair match, Hercules was basically a brawler with some wrestling ability. Steamboat does good work here and gets put over.

Uncle Elmer vs. Adorable Adrian Adonis *-Poor dud.

Tito Santana & the Junkyard Dog vs. the Funk Brothers: **- Not bad, Santana showcases his great ability which would propel him to be One of the more recognized faces in the WWF.

King Kong Bundy vs. Hulk Hogan for the WWF Championship in a cage **-

Typical Hogan job, nothing special about this even in a cage.

All in all it is a pretty average ppv , with the exception of the Battle Royal, The Tag Team Titles match , there isn't too much worth seeing over again. Vince obviously wanted to cash

in on the success of the first Wrestlemania but instead

it comes out to be like one of those average movie sequels

that aren't as good as the original.",1138233600,,2943,4.44589552238806

7834232,4,6302999928,"Between 3 and 4 stars.

I am not going to try an exaggerate and make this out to be a better event than it was, but the point is this Wrestlemania 1and 2 have to be looked at in the context of time.  Wrestlemania was still in an experimental phase, it was not an established thing.

With that in mind I want to reiterate, it least this as oppose to Wrestlemania IX, it has a few 5 * matches.  It's main problem is that it is very hit or miss.

1. Mr. Wonderful vs. Don Muraco -not a good opener. 1 3/4 *

2. Macho Man vs. George the Animal Steel- one of the few in between matches, probably give it 3 1/2 *s

3. Jake the Snake vs. George Wells.  2 1/2 *

4.  Boxing Match T-Piper - ok, kinda boring 2 *s

5.  women's Title - next

6.  Flag match -next

7.  Invitational Battle Royal- Cool match.  The NFLers do a pretty good job.  Andre eliminates the Hart Foundation and wins in what is probably his finest Wrestlemania moment. 3 1/2 *s

8.  Tag Team Title-  THIS MATCH WAS AWESOME 5 *s !

  The Dream Team (Beefcake & Valentine w/ Johnny V.) versus the British Bulldogs (w/ Captain Lou and Ozzy Osbourne).  This match was really good.  All of Davy Boy's moves that he would use in singles competition are on display.  Greg Valantine gives his best mania performace and Beefcake brings out a few new moves.  Match also has a an interesting ending, as the Bulldogs put blood sweat and tears in order to get the gold.

9.  Ricky Steam boat vs. hercules -ok 2 1/4 *

10.  Adorable Adrian...Uncle Elmer  NEXT

11. Hulk Hogan vs. King Kong Bundy in a steel cage.  This match was memorable for two reasons.  First it popluarized the steel cage match with fans.  Second, it started the trend of having Hulk take on a big name opponent (you can imagine now why people roll their eyes when they think of his main events in VII and VIII).  Both men do as good a job as can be expected.  Probably a 3 1/2 * match + plus the cage probaly adds a * so maybe a 4 or 4 1/2 * match.

Not the best Wrestlemania by any strech, but definitely not the worst.",1113091200,,2038,4.099489795918367
7834233,2,6302999928,"The Battle Royal

At WrestleMaina 2, several NFL football players decided to see if they could hold their own with the WWE Superstars in a Battle Royal.  The likes of William ""Refrigerator"" Perry, Bill Fralic and Russ Francis did an admirable job, but in the end it was the master of the Battle Royal that came out on top - WWE Hall of Famer, Andre The Giant.",1111536000,,359,4.343283582089552
7834234,3,6302999928,"Perhaps the most unique feature of Wrestlemania 2 (1986) is that this was the first and only time the event originated from three separate venues: New York (at the Nassau Coliseum), Chicago (at the Rosemont Horizon), and L.A. (at the Sports Arena).  Dragged down the tubes by some dreadful guest celebrity commentary and five awful matches, the event still redeems itself with some truly remarkable moments.  Unfortunately, the end result remains that Wrestlemania 2 is at best an average effort from the WWF.

New York (with Vince McMahon & Susan St. James):

Paul ""Mr. Wonderful"" Orndorff vs. The Magnificent Muraco w/ Mr. Fuji:
Average brawl for the era.  2 1/2 ** for a double count-out finish.

Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage (champion) w/ Ms. Elizabeth vs. George ""The Animal"" Steele"" for the Intercontinental Championship:
It's quite entertaining, if not routine.  The wily Savage, as usual, cheats to beat Steele once again, as if there would be any doubt that the I-C Champ wouldn't actually win.  4 1/2 **** (for the added bonus of getting to see a flower bouquet being used as a weapon).

Special Attraction Boxing Match: Roddy Piper w/ Lou Duva vs. Mr. T w/ ""Smokin'"" Joe Frasier & the Haiti Kid:
Made even worse by St. James and Vince McMahon's amateurish commentary, this 'match' is why fast-forward buttons on remotes were made. Piper loses by DQ for slamming Mr. T, so, no one really wins (particularly, the viewer).  However, the result of mixing wrestling and boxing becomes obvious: it is a complete bore.  2 **

Jake 'The Snake' Roberts vs. George Wells:
This one is a barely watchable squash match. 1 1/2 *

Chicago: (with 'Gorilla Monsoon, Cathy Lee Crosby, Ernie 'The Cat' Ladd, & 'Mean' Gene Okerlund)

20-Man Battle Royal featuring the WWF vs. the NFL:
The highlights here include William 'The Refrigerator' Perry squaring off with John Studd; Bruno Sammartino comes out retirement one more time; Studd mouthing off against Bill Fralic of the Atlanta Falcons; and Andre the Giant facing the double-teaming efforts of the Hart Foundation.  Andre wins, as Cathy Lee Crosby rather obviously points out, ""He is the Giant.""  4 ****

British Bulldogs vs. the Dream Team (Greg Valentine & Brutus Beefcake) for WWF Tag Team Championship:
Easily, it's the best match of the event, as the Bulldogs steal the show out from under the Hulkster.  The Bulldogs finally win the title after a long chase of Valentine and Beefcake. 5 *****

Cpl. Kirschner vs. Nikolai Volkoff w/ 'Classy' Freddie Blassie in a 'Flag' Match:
Grab a snack instead and skip this one. Mercifully, this terrible match ends quickly, as Kirschner predictably prevails over Volkoff. 1/2 *

Velvet McIntyre vs. the Fabulous Moolah for the Ladies' WWF Championship:
It lasts about a minute, so why did anyone involved bother? Moolah wins. 1/2 *

L.A. (with Jesse Ventura, Elvira, and 'Lord' Alfred Hayes)

Ricky 'The Dragon' Steamboat vs. Hercules Hernandez:
Steamboat gives us a preview here why he and Savage would make wrestling history a year later fighting over the I-C Championship at Wrestlemania III. 'The Dragon' wins over the wily Hernandez with a flying body press.  3 1/2 ***

Uncle Elmer vs. 'Adorable' Adrian Adonis w/ Jimmy Hart:
The less said the better - no rating (it just can't get any lower).

Tito Santana & the Junkyard Dog vs. the Funk Brothers w/ Jimmy Hart:
Surprisingly, this one is pretty entertaining.  The Funk boys take it with some cheating courtesy of Jimmy Hart.  3 1/2 ***

King Kong Bundy w/ Bobby Heenan vs. champion Hulk Hogan for the WWF Title (in a steel cage):
A potentially awesome match is wasted as Hogan instead barely breaks a sweat disposing of Bundy, despite supposedly having heavily-taped ribs from an earlier assault from Bundy on national television weeks before.  2 1/2 **

The disappointing main attraction (Hogan vs. Bundy) best sums up why Wrestlemania 2 doesn't age well after almost twenty years.  Still, what is truly remarkable is how Wrestlemania III a year later would so vastly outclass this effort.  Although wrestling pay-per-views were still a new concept back in 1986, this event, unfortunately, ranks as one of the most forgettable Wrestlemanias ever.",1095638400,2,4191,4.968436154949785
