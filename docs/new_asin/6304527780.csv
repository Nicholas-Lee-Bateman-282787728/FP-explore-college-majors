8135979,3,6304527780,"Panchito (Gabriel Gonzalez) didn't care to break his mother's heart when he left to United States from Michoacn at the early age of 6-7 y.o. He thought he had a purpose, looking for his father. His mother always told Panchito NOT TO DO IT, it was not worth the risk, but Panchito, being the man of the house now, felt he was ready.
-THIS IS ONLY A MOVIE-
This is what I call luck! Panchito arrives to California safe and sound. He didn't end up raped or dead. And without knowing anybody, gets by, met Tere Alvarez (Maria Teresa Alvarez - ""Adriana del Rio, actriz""), who dyed his hair blonde, changed his clothes and told him he was ''Frankie'' from now on.
Even luckier, Panchito, sorry, Frankie, finds his dad with his new family. And he didn't even remembered him, I guess, so Frankie goes back to Panchito again, gets to Mxico without a scratch and his mother, all worried and sick, didn't spanked him! Of course he keeps his father's secret from his mom, telling her he didn't find him. After all, she shouldn't worry, right?

I think that this movie, absurd and unrealistic, is just a 90 commercial to promote Carlos Colorado's ""La Sonora Santanera"". ""Resortes"" and Norma Lazareno were there too... Did I miss the part where someone is born in the USA and have no papers? Otherwise I don't get the title ''wetback at birth''. Makes no sense...",1316822400,,1349,4.574380165289257
