8157091,1,B0001GH7SQ,"I purchased this because I wanted an adult movie in 3-D.  The 3-D does not work at all, even though it is field-sequential (electronic shutter glasses).  It was probably one of those bogus, so-called ""3-D conversions""-allegedly converting a 2-D movie to 3-D. Other 2-D movies are also marketed as 3-D when they are not. Those include Dementia 13,  Night of the Living Dead, In Search of the Perfect 10, Bloody Tease, etc.

Field-Sequential 3-D really works with the right movies! Bogus marketing of this type is one main reason that 3-D never takes off.",1176249600,8,553,4.851063829787234
