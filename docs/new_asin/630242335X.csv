461893,5,630242335X,The undiscovered country in this movie is the future although in Hamlet it is referred to as death. This movie is the last with the whole crew of the Original Series and it goes out with a bang. The story is packed with stars and many twists and turns. The movie came out as the Soviet Union was collapsing and so it parallels the Klingons in that way: too big of a military and no way to feed its people.,1504483200,,405,4.075

461898,4,630242335X,Good to see this movie again since the only version I own is on VHS. I'm curious if anyone knows why parts with Rene Rene Auberjonois were edited out. He played Col (Or General) West. He was the Klingon assassin in disguise. That's why there was human blood where he fell.,1499558400,2,272,4.352941176470588
461899,4,630242335X,"Very good ending for the original crew of Star Trek. This movie was made in a time when explosions in space had sound effects and men kicked open 23rd century doors (see Scotty scene) for dramatic effect, but it was a classic before it was old!",1499472000,,244,4.326086956521739

461927,4,630242335X,"The best of the ""original cast"" movies. I won't go into the plot, but it should have enough ""action"" for those who love that stuff.

By the time this was made, The Next Generation had already been on TV for several years. Even so, this movie is poignant as it serves as a formal good-by to the original crew. The characters are openly talking of retirement, and Lord knows, some of them are starting to look a little old. Much has changed since 1966, special effects are a lot more sophisticated and technology is starting to change daily life in a significant way. But not so with the human heart.

And so our Captain is telling us there will soon be a new crew on the Enterprise. Such strange words to come from our hero's lips. Good things do come to an end, and ""the franchise"" lives on. And on. I will say that it is just not the same. I will always remember those spring evenings, the Star Trek theme song and our original crew..",1484352000,,935,4.306818181818182

461988,5,630242335X,"A Classic! The last true original Star Trek movie. It sees the old crew fully reunited for the last time on screen, including Sulu FINALLY given the captain's chair of the Excelsior. This movie deals with themes of racism, social and political change, and putting aside your own deep seated prejudices in order to fight for a change that you know will be for the overall good. Combined with Master level special effects for the time, and strong acting, The Undiscovered Country is a fitting close to the storyline of TOS that can be truly appreciated as one of the good Star Trek movies.",1479168000,3,587,4.653846153846154

I was having problems sleeping and my mind often races at night.  My doctor suggested I listen to audio books or something.  Well being the Trekkie I am I chose one of the franchise movies I had not yet seen to listen to as I fell asleep.  This complies with doctors orders.  Something I was interested in CHECK something where I could use the energy my mind was still producing CHECK (as I listen to the movie I visualize EVERYTHING when I say everything I mean everything.

It definitely looks a whole lot better than that chintz fest, and has a more logical plot. Shatner meets his match for rug-chewing in Plummer's Khan 2.0. Iman is nice to watch. Still, meh. None of the pre-reboot Trek movies is very good or holds up well to the tv franchise. The first Trek movie worthy of the franchise -- not that it isn't also flawed -- is Into Darkness. Why it took a quarter of a century to start getting it right is one of those Mysteries of the Universe.",1476316800,,609,4.350877192982456

All throughout the movie, it was evident how it was time for the actors to put their characters to rest.  It is sad how some of the actors have actually ""gone where no man has gone before"" but they gave all of us Star Trek fans many memorable moments which continues to keep the Star Trek saga alive for over 50 years and have produced other Star Trek adventures, including the reboot episodes recently created.  So far, the BEST Star Trek movie was, and remains, Number 2, The Wrath of Khan.  Of course, this view is only a personal opinion, and I am sure some would disagree with me, but oh well, Amazon asked and I responded, with kindness and respect of course.",1471651200,2,780,4.471830985915493

Sure Wrath of Khan is the movie I will say is the best of the series because it has Khan in it a ton of great effects shots, but this one just has something about that I can't stop watching it when i see it on TV. Christopher Plummer's character is by far my favorite villain in just about any movie ever. The acting is top notch and it was by far the best send off to a film series ever. I actually think my favorite part of the film is the score. Cliff Eidelman gives a score unlike that of any other Trek movie. The final battle music is just epic and you only get a very small hint of the Star Trek theme at the very end.

462301,4,630242335X,"Possible spoilers.  With the previous Trek adventure (The Final Frontier) being a huge disappointment, Paramount returns Nicholas Meyer to the director chair.  He was also at the helm in what is generally considered the best of this series featuring the original cast, The Wrath of Kahn.  Creator Gene Roddenberry had died just before the film was released but his fingerprints remain.

In what would be the final film with this primary cast, the story (co-written by Leonard Nimoy) begins with a huge explosion that nearly disables a starship commanded by the now Captain Sulu (George Takei).  It turns out an energy generating moon of the Klingon planet exploded.  The results being that they will run out of oxygen in 50 years.  Knowing their plight, the Klingons under the leadership of Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner, who had a similar but human role in The Final Frontier!) are looking to sign a new peace treaty with the Federation and the Romulans.

Under his objections, Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) is ordered to escort the Klingons to a neutral site in an undisclosed location.  But sabotage is afoot which leads to the assassination of Gorkon and it appears to be the doing of someone on the Enterprise.  Kirk and Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley) surrender and board the Klingon ship only to be tried in court and sentenced to life at hard labor on a frozen planet.  Keep an eye out for Kirk and McCoys Klingon defense attorney played by Michael Dorn who will become Worf in the Next Generation TV series and films.  Also spotted Christian Slater (TVs Mr. Robot) as a communications officer on Sulus ship.

As Kirk and McCoy plot their escape, with help from Martia (Iman, Mrs. David Bowie), a shapeshifter, Spock and the rest of the Enterprise crew must use good old detective skills to figure out who the real assassins are aboard the ship.  James Doohan returns as Scotty, Walter Koenig as Chekov and Nichelle Nichols as Uhura and newcomer Kim Cattrall joins the crew as Vulcan Lt. Valeris.  On the Klingon side, Gen. Chang (Christopher Plummer, Sound of Music) makes a great foe.  Hes respectful of Kirks military skills and is fluent in Shakespearian dialog.  The movies title itself comes from Hamlet.

The film is more CSI: Space than an action-based thriller.  But what battle scenes there are, are well done.  The action picks up when another plot to assassinate key players in the peace process is uncovered.  While perhaps not the best of the series, it is certainly a fitting farewell to the original cast.",1470355200,,2526,4.855140186915888

462504,4,630242335X,"Considering the last few Star Trek movies, III, IV & V, VI is a bit better in both the storyline, writing and acting.  As I said before, the crew is a ""crew"".  They DO work together well.  They should, they've had enough time to do it.  Hell, even in the Navy you're likely to transfer off a ship after four years.  I digress.  The Undiscovered Country has Kirk smack dab in the middle of the Klingon Empire and a conspiracy.  I mean, what would a Star Trek movie be without a conspiracy?

Kirk and McCoy are imprisoned for the death of a High Chancellor.  They are thrown to the proverbial wolves in a hard-labor camp  la the former Soviet Union's Gulags in Siberia.  The remainder of the story is whether or not (1) they will be released, (2) they will escape, (3) they will be rescued or, ultimately, (4) they will die in prison.

It is Star Trek and we all know that unless you're caught in a ""red shirt"" life will continue for you.  Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is a good movie written by Leonard Nimoy and NOT directed by William Shatner.",1464739200,,1054,4.343589743589743

I love the connection to current events, which tied the movie to the fall of communism, the Soviet Union and the Chernobyl reactor disaster. The Shakespearean dialogue that intertwines throughout the film lends itself well to counter the deadpan delivery by Dr. McCoy's distaste for that archaic form of speech - ""I'd give real money if he'd shut up!"" he directs to the excellent nemesis, Christopher Plummer's, Chang.

Kirk finally deals with the loss of his sun at the hands of a Klingon (Star Trek III: Search for Spock). And the crew deals with their personal feelings toward Klingons, which is used against them as part of the overall conspiracy. There is not too much action, aside from the assassination scene and the scene at the end. But it emphasizes what it going on. Every single photon torpedo has a very emotional impact. And this version (The Director's Cut) is the best and only version to buy because it shows a deeper part to the conspiracy than the theatrical version.

And the opening music. Very dark and foreboding, foreshadowing the rest of the movie.

462665,4,630242335X,"Leonard Nimoy (who also served as co-executive producer and co-writer of the original story) and William Shatner were 60 when this movie was released, DeForest Kelly and James Doohan were 71, Nichelle Nichols was 59, and most of them were beginning to show their age, or at least sound like it (notice how rough Nimoy's voice often sounds), so it's not surprising that it was the last of the franchise to feature the original crew.  In fact, at several points Kirk and McCoy mention that they're retiring in a few months.  But if they had to go out, at least they do it with a bang, and in doing so they lead directly in to the situation that will obtain in ST:TNG.

Sulu (George Takei) is now captain of the ""Excelsior,"" and apparently the only one of the old company who's still in space.  While on a routine mission, his ship detects a massive explosion on Praxis, an industrialized moon of the Klingon homeworld, Kronos.  Two months later Kirk (Shatner), McCoy (Kelly), Scotty (Doohan), Uhura (Nichols), and Chekhov (Walter Koenig), along with several other members of Starfleet's high command, are summoned to a briefing by Spock (Nimoy), who reveals that the occurrence has doomed Kronos itself: in 50 Terran years the planet will exhaust its oxygen.  Faced with this massive humanitarian (or should that be Klingonitarian?) crisis, Spock, urged by his father Sarek (Mark Lenard), has been in contact with the Klingon rulership and has managed to set up a peace conference.  The Klingon Chanceller Gorkon (David Warner) will be coming to Earth--and the Enterprise has been chosen to escort him.  Despite objections from some of the officers, notably Adm. Cartwright (Brock Peters), and Kirk's own misgivings (""I've never trusted Klingons and I never will,"" he says, noting that he's been unable to forgive them for killing his son, David Marcus), he and his bridge crew are still Starfleet officers and must go where they're sent.  With a new Vulcan navigator, Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall), they set off for the rendezvous point.

Following a state dinner lubricated by entirely to much Romulan ale, the Klingon ship is suddenly attacked by torpedoes, then boarded by two figures in magnetic boots who begin firing on Gorkon and his crew, inflicting heavy casualties, including the Chancellor himself.  Enterprise's databases insist she fired the torpedoes, but none are missing from her payload.  Kirk and McCoy beam over to try to save Gorkon, but his wounds are too serious.  The Klingons accuse them of plotting assassination, arrest them, and take them to Kronos for trial, where they're found guilty and sentenced to life at hard labor in the dilithium mines on Rura Penthe, a bitterly cold planetoid where survival on the surface is virtually impossible.  It's up to Spock, Scotty, and the rest to find out the truth about the attack and rescue their fellows--who, meanwhile, have been contacted by a fellow laborer, Martia (Iman), who offers to help them escape.  But Martia may not be all she appears.

There's plenty of action, as we've come to expect, in this last outing for Kirk & Co., yet we also learn that Klingons care for justice (perhaps a natural outgrowth of an honor-obsessed warrior culture): they provide their prisoners with a defense attorney who seems to be sincere about his work.  And it turns out, too, that in this Universe Sherlock Holmes really existed: Spock reveals that ""an ancestor of mine"" once declared that ""Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how incredible, must be the truth.""  His efforts at detection, aided by the rest of the bridge crew, are a high point, and of course the effects, the aliens, and the music add immeasurably to the enjoyability quotient.",1442016000,,3733,4.9456

The story analogous to the situation between the United States & former Soviet Union at the time was a nice touch.  It wouldn't be Trek without a morality play and a message reminding us how silly it's been where we are as humans, and how much better it can be where we should go is always welcome.

The story was a clever with the Scooby-doo mystery (I think there were different versions of this film - I saw the one where the Trekky-gang infiltrates the assassination attempt and unmasks Old Man Witherspoon at the end of the film and it struck me as completely corny.)  The special effects were excellent, including the visuals for a cloaked-yet-armed Klingon bird of prey spaceship, but the music was fairly bland (and a little too Holst-inspired).",1420502400,,619,4.895238095238096

463196,5,630242335X,"This movie has a spectacular opener with one of my favorite musical themes by Cliff Eidelman  counted among the many great ones written for the Star Trek movies.

This is one of my favorite original cast Star Trek movies, despite Nicholas Meyer frequently ignoring established Star Trek canon. Just one example,  ""We've never been this close."" Really?! You mean you weren't just attacked and rescued by a Klingon ship in Star Trek V? You didn't commandeer a Klingon ship in Star Trek III, and use that ship throughout Star Trek IV? This is in fact my only significant complaint about ST VI  that Meyer ignored Star Trek history whenever it suited him. The fan following and its support for Star Trek is a significant factor in the series and film's successes; including merchandizing. When canon is so carelessly disregarded in this fashion, it is somewhat disrespectful to the earlier writer's work and the fans.

As others have noted, this movie (and others) is ""replete"" with Shakespeare references including the title. Provides a running literary reference, and some continuity I suppose.

I particularly like the scenes with Kirk and McCoy on trial and especially the ones on Rura Penthe  and less appreciated some of the contrived scenes which were seemingly created to get as many of the original cast in the same scene as possible (galley scene for example). I like all the characters and loved seeing everybody in the movie, but the scenes should make sense with respect to the roles their characters play in the story.

A fun and exciting movie, because of and despite Meyer.",1416960000,2,1585,4.910112359550562

463199,5,630242335X,"The final film to star the original STAR TREK cast is also one of the series' best, ranking up with II, III, and IV. Nicholas Meyer, who helmed WRATH OF KHAN, returns to the director's chair, and ILM returns to the visual effects department. Best of all, the entire cast give their best performances ever (in particular, Christopher Plummer's portrayal as a devious Klingon general is a treat). The surprisingly intelligent and strong plot involves an uneasy attempt at peacemaking between the Starfleet Federation and the Klingons. Things get ugly when a Klingon ambassador's ship is attacked, leading to a horrifying murder. Kirk and Dr. McCoy are unjustly framed, so it's up to the rest of the crew to prove their innocence and uncover the real killers before another person is killed. What's fascinating about this ""trek"" is the very real racial tension displayed in not only the Klingons, but even in the protagonists (Kirk has obvious reservations about trusting Klingons... and for good reason), providing a very ""human"" depth to the story. The picture builds masterfully to its surprise climax (the suspenseful showdown between Kirk and a Bird of Prey, in particular, is nail-biting, edge of your seat fun) capped off by a very satisfying ending. As a ""last hurrah"" for Kirk and company, STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY is fantastic entertainment all around.

463202,4,630242335X,"In the sixth and final instalment of the TOS movie series, Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise engage in an emergency diplomatic mission to deliver a Klingon ambassador to Earth after a catastrophe on Kronos threatens to plunge the galaxy into war.

Fortunately after the debacle of ST V and its fuzzy 'New Age' theme, the writers got their act together and brought the show back down to 'Earth' and thankfully just at the right time.  ST VI is a vast improvement on the previous three movies with a decently scripted plot, reasonably good acting (even from Shatner) and a believable conspiracy theme that tuned in well with the state of the world at the time the movie was made (a kind of allegory of the end of the Cold War) and also now with our tendency to fire our guns first and ask questions later.

The pace of the movie is well handled, from the surprise attack at the beginning to the final battle between the Enterprise, the Excelsior and the special Klingon ship led by a renegade Klingon general.  Even the end scene with the attempted assassination designed to trigger all-out war ranks well with outstanding episodes such as DS9's 'By the Pale Moonlight.'

While the worn out crew in their 60's saving the galaxy stretches credibility, ST VI does a terrific job at producing an entertaining, well thought out movie that delivers on its premise and gives a fitting send off for the Enterprise and its crew.  It is all the more remarkable considering this was done on a relatively low budget and with a franchise that probably passed its prime by the time the fourth movie was made, and after a major commercial and critical flop in the previous instalment.

A good Trek movie overall.",1410739200,,1698,4.64

This isn't out of any fanboy sense of having to watch every movie in the series in order, it's just that a lot of this film's meaning is lost when it's your first voyage with Kirk and crew.

That being said, this is a beautiful farewell to the original crew of the Enterprise. The film manages to encapsulate the best of every character and remind us why we love them. It's well directed, exceedingly well written, and beautifully scored. Best of all, it's the kind of ending you wouldn't see in franchise finales nowadays. Instead of the current standard of putting two in its head to make sure it won't get back up, this movie leaves a wonderful franchise very much alive, instead making it clear that we are just parting company.

Fun fact: In this film Mr. Spock credits a Sherlock Holmes quote (""If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."") to an ancestor of his.

463428,4,630242335X,"One of the better Star Trek movies.  Although they try to give roles to all the other actors, James T. Kirk always returns to center stage.  Whether it's during the trial in Klingon or in his captivity at the Klingon Death Camp, he manages to defy all odds and still focuses just on himself.

The movie is about a new future, an uncertain future after Klingon manages to overmine one of its moons, causing it to blow up, condemning the proud Klingons to extinction or to strike a treaty with the hated Federation.  Kirk is sent out to greet the Klingon Chancellor who quickly gets assassinated and Interstellar War is about to break out.

Christopher ""The Sound of Music"" Plummer gives a great performance as a Klingon General who quotes Shakespeare, yearning for the old days of battle... sort of like Vladimir Putin.",1398988800,,818,4.6923076923076925

In other words, good enough to watch if you enjoy anything that involves Klingons, Pepto-Bismol blood and Kim Cattrall in one of the most absurd castings in recent film history.
Christopher Plummer adds a nice touch of high camp with his Shakespeare-spouting Klingon warrior, and all in all the story helps advance Kirk's character in some significant ways.
Of course, it's these later Original Cast films that almost killed the franchise, so there's that. The action is fairly uninspired, as are most of the actors, who really do seem to be getting too old to ""be out there hoppin' galaxies.""",1394928000,,778,4.901515151515151

Just wish Captain Sulu would have referred to Captain Kirk as Admiral Kirk when it was all over, because even if demoted, he still was a grand master of an officer whose shoes could not be easily filled.

Spock's comment - ""if I was human"" - was very apropos as you could almost imagine our Vulcan friend allow that smirk flow gracefully from his face.

Hope everyone gets to enjoy these epic films that have such a loyal following and charisma behind them. So sad that some of these actors are no longer around like Dr. McCoy and Scotty, but fortunately they had one last opportunity to grace the film version of this series and bring joy to so many one last time!",1391990400,,877,4.46875

I am an engineer who loves the scientific premises in Star Trek used to develop a realistic idea of what the future of the human race might hold. Gene Roddenbury began that tradition with the original series that was based upon the latest thinking in physics, chemistry, biology, and space sciences. Combining science and drama proved to be a great way of giving us ideas to pursue in engineering and research. Surprisingly, there have been numerous Star Trek examples of futuristic devices that have become standard everyday reality. (Think wristwatches that are cellphones, plastic replicators, international space stations, etc.). Star Trek VI did not disappoint with the focus on cloaking devices in this episode. US military is working on such technology as we speak. True, it is in its infancy, just as are humanoid robots, but it is not ""far out imaginary"" stuff.

I have always thought that many of the Star Trek series didn't concentrate enough on the Klingons.  There is only so much story you can have following humans around in a space ship or space station, no matter the setting.

I did find some of the acting of the Klingons to be less violent than their nature has been shown to be in the past.  And Klingons referring to Shakespeare and using a Shakespearean line as a battle cry was just plain hokey.",1383350400,,528,4.357142857142857

463769,4,630242335X,"OK, I this movie is pretty good, as a part of the whole Star Trek continuum. What's pretty bizarre though, is the plot's metaphoric parallel to the fall of communism in the latter part of the 20th century. Though there are Russian flourishes at times, the Klingon Empire seems directly cast as communist China.

Spock mentions the old Vulcan proverb, ""Only Nixon could go to China""; in fact, President Richard Nixon did indeed visit China at a time when it was the archenemy of the United States. In this movie, Captain Kirk is a metaphor for the anti-communist Nixon. Because it had been so isolated, China was very much an ""undiscovered country"".

China is a recurrent theme, not only in some of the Klingon names (e.g.: Commander Chang), but in more subtle ways too: the shattering of Sulu's china teacup, and in the table setting for the diplomatic dinner with napkin rings, and; once again; the delicate china dinnerware.

What we now know as Classic Star Trek (CST) began inauspiciously in 1964 with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/failed-pilot-episode/dp/B00005QTAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">failed pilot episode</a>, one that short-sighted NBC should have accepted outright. After major personnel changes and a new pilot, the show was given a green light. The Enterprise crew's ""5-year mission"" ended over a quarter-century later, when the cast of that original 1966-69 TV series had their last hurrah. The occasion was this feature film, STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.

Nicholas Meyer, who contributed to the script of and directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STAR-TREK-II-THE-WRATH-OF-KHAN/dp/B0000683DH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN</a>&nbsp;(1982), performed the same duties for this farewell picture. Based on a Leonard Nimoy story, this is truly classic Star Trek, as Kirk and crew get down and dirty with the hated Klingons. Betrayal from within results in our favorite starship captain and medico being taken prisoner by an odiferous enemy. They're put on trial, convicted and sentenced to a life of hard labor on icy planet Rura Penthe, thrown in with a variety of aliens. Capt. Kirk even defeats one of these monsters in a fistfight.

We'd seen it all before, yet this was our final bittersweet chance to experience such familiar thrills without watching a CST show rerun. Kudos to everyone involved for a superlative last effort. As this movie so clearly demonstrates, Classic Star Trek went out on top.

TRULY THE END OF AN ERA:
This was the last motion picture for both DeForest Kelley and Mark Lenard (Sarek).
Within 48 hours of viewing the completed film, series creator Gene Roddenberry died.

463867,5,630242335X,"There is very little disagreement on the top two Star Trek Original Cast movies: II & IV are at the top of almost everyone's list (with I in the ""meh"" category, and poor number V ranking in the ""Oh my, that was embarrassing"" category). This one, for me, is tied with II and IV  for the best. I won't bother to describe the plot; others have done that quite well. Suffice to say that this movie really gets the camaraderie of the crew right; the synergy between them is perfect as the senior officers deal with the knowledge that there are traitors and assassins in their midst, but they never turn on each other; they get to the task at hand with just the right amount of humor balancing the dramatic action. For what it's worth, my ratings on the entire 6-film series are: I. 2.5 stars, II. 5 stars, III. 3.5 stars (The Search for Spock is, I think, often underrated; it is not their best but really not a bad movie, with Leonard Nimoy taking the directorial duties, as he did for number IV as well), IV. 5 stars, V. 0 stars (after seeing this with a date, she asked me what the movie was even about; I had no idea and neither did she; this movie is just a mess from start to finish. Kirk free-climbing El Capitan? I am a lifelong rock climber and all I can say is, give me a freakin' break), VI. 5 stars. So there you go, four of the six movies are very good and well worth seeing, and VI is certainly one of the good ones.",1378252800,,1425,4.163043478260869
463868,4,630242335X,"For starters, I'll give a rundown of the technical stuff on the DVD.  The case is solidly made and will protect the DVD inside of anything short of dropping it off a cliff, setting it on fire or running it over with a car (and if this happens, you're really doing something wrong), so that's a definite positive.  They really should sell more DVDs in cases like this.
The DVD has many features, though I haven't watched all of them yet, but what I have seen is good.  The commentaries are especially interesting.  Lots of neat tidbits of information from the production side.

As a movie . . . well, let me put it like this: I'm not a trekkie.  I've tried to get into Star Trek, both the original and TNG, but I've never really been able to enjoy more than a few episode of either.  That said, I love both this movie, and Wrath of Khan enough that I had to add them to my personal collection.  Shatner's acting is, as always, strange, but weirdly engaging and a solid counterbalance to Nimoy's  calm, dry performance.  David Warner's brief roll as Klingon Chancellor Gorkon adds a lot of emotional weight to the film, and Christopher Plummer's General Chang is one hell of a compelling villain: fascinating and complex, not necessarily evil, but, like many of the characters in the plot, caught up so badly by the fear of change that it drives him to do terrible things.  He's the kind of bad guy that you can really believe people would follow.
The plot is vastly superior to the garbage J.J. Abrams is putting out, in that it knows that you a lot of action and some random boobs does not a good movie make.  You have to build the characters and work an intelligent angle into the character drama.  In this case, Undiscovered Country is a fantastic exploration of prejudice and the difficulties people face in overcoming prejudice.  It has a few moments that don't work perfectly, a few jokes that fall into sitcom level humor (complete with the sitcom musical cues), but the parts are never bad enough that it spoils anything.  On the whole, the movie is a success and well worth watching.",1377820800,2,2091,4.523936170212766

463870,5,630242335X,"As the ""final voyage"" of the original crew, our beloved and intrepid space-farers once again save the galaxy from disaster.  Every actor was hitting their marks and poured themselves into their parts.  Most notable, in my opinion, was George Takei's portrayal of Captain Sulu; it was a shame that we didn't get to see more of him either in this or in later movies.  The storyline is good and fun, as long as you keep your nerd-fact checking to minimum.  (Dozens of paper-bound books to translate the Klingon phrases?  really?  We have lost Kindle in the 23rd century?)  Overall, a great film.... there are moments for every Trek fan and even non-Trekkies will enjoy the action/mystery/political intrigue that is weaved throughout the script.",1377216000,,741,4.975609756097561

Having said this, Star Trek VI: The undiscovered country, is quite possibly my favorite of the movies. It definitely competes well with First Contact and The Wrath of Khan for best plotlines and general story.
Star Trek takes a vastly different ploy from the originals in that it initiates very serious undertones and a very plausible fear; a fear in which even the main characters are very much in danger at any point throughout the movie. Very gritty and surreal.
The story begins in which a Klingon moon is destroyed in an accident, and henceforth dooms the empire without cooperation with starfleet. This sets an excellent precedent not only for this movie and series, but for the future series and movies to come. The Klingons are well played, with excellent performances from Christopher Plummer and others. This movie also induces a classical twist, with various Shakespearean and cultural references that actually come into play in various parts of my life.
All in all, I would rate this in my top 5 of the star trek movies, and possibly even my #1. With the horror and dramatic effect of First Contact, and the rare epic nature of Wrath of Khan, this one definitely stands out in its own rite as a Classic Star Trek movie. I definitely recommend this film, and the series to go along with!",1370736000,,1414,4.682730923694779

Basically a commentary on the breakup of the Soviet Union, continuing the long Star Trek tradition of commenting on current events, we get what we've become accustomed to getting from Leonard Nimoy, an excellent story that works as both Star Trek and as a movie. Gene Roddenberry is said to have alternately liked this movie, hated this movie, felt indifferent about this movie, had problems with this movie, and never heard of this movie. Frankly, the only problem I had with this movie was the use of the term ""right standard rudder"" when starships don't have rudders, and this term has never been used, before or since, in the entire history of the Star Trek franchise (just a sniggling problem, since it has nothing to do with the plot). That, and the pinkish Klingon blood (done to avoid an ""R"" rating for excessive gore; apparently the MPAA doesn't consider it gory if the buckets of blood are colored like Pepto Bismal...).

464264,4,630242335X,"Released in December of 1991, the 20th anniversary of Captain Kirk's final voyage as commander of the legendary U.S.S. Enterprise is fast approaching.  With the famed 1966-69 television series' original ensemble (William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, James Doohan, & Walter Koenig) gathered together one last time, director Nicholas Meyer returns to guide them on one of the franchise's best entries: an intelligent, political murder-mystery that reiterates that peace can frighten even the coldest of warriors.  Tapping into the real world emotions of the Cold War's final days, ""Star Trek"" once again demonstrates how and why science fiction can become a timeless analogy to issues that any common person can relate to.

In this installment, after heroically defending the universe for more than 25 years, an aging (and now-embittered) Captain Kirk and his famous crew of Captain Spock, Dr. McCoy, Uhura, Scotty, and Chekov set out on one last adventure battling a nefarious intergalactic conspiracy that threatens to violently disrupt a lasting Federation-Klingon treaty at all costs.  With the Klingon Empire facing inevitable extinction due to a catastrophic environmental disaster, a tentative truce with the Federation is now imminent.  Yet, mysterious forces are at work sabotaging the upcoming peace conference with a devastating political assassination that may well cost the imprisoned Captain Kirk & Dr. McCoy their lives.  In the end, it all comes down to a heart-stopping, fateful race to prevent the next assassination on planet Khitomer during the conference, but a devastating secret weapon awaits that can hold both the Enterprise and Captain Sulu's U.S.S. Excelsior at bay.

Backed by an ominous musical score and terrific guest performances from Rosana DeSoto, Brock Peters, Mark Lenard, David Warner, Kim Cattrall, Michael Dorn Kurtwood Smith, and Christopher Plummer (as the imperious General Chang), this ""Star Trek"" adventure holds up extremely well over time twisting familiar Trek elements into an exciting political thriller that also serves as the final episode of the original crew's fabled exploits (complete with the cast signing off with a flourish on the last Captain's Log commencing the end credits).  The only significant drawback of this film is its over-reliance on Shakespearian quotes (particularly by Christopher Plummer late in the film).  While it is fantastic for Trek to offer such a literate, thought-provoking plotline, overkill in the final act makes the whole Shakespearian concept come off as possibly too pretentious.  Even so, Captain Kirk's log entry concludes the festivities with a timeless quote harkening back to ""Peter Pan,"" which is an appropriate, classy farewell to the original, classic Trek, while graciously acknowledging the franchise's future incarnations.

Rating: 8.5/10 (An excellent film by almost any standard, as long as you can tolerate the frequent literary references).

P.S. The stellar bonus features include the nostalgic ""teaser"" trailer (from the summer of 1991) that should be considered one of the absolute best from that era, as it makes you truly eager to see the film even without offering any sneak peeks.",1302739200,4,3234,5.511111111111111
464265,5,630242335X,"The Klingons were always the number-one villains of Star Trek, but this movie is the only time they were really interesting. From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNG/dp/B000RZIGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNG</a>&nbsp;onward, they turned into caricatures of medieval Vikings or Mongols, with a stereotypical warrior culture, and it became impossible to take them seriously as a galactic superpower. They fought with swords in the 24th century, for crying out loud.

But in The Undiscovered Country, they are modern and formidable. They are radically different from humans, but their society is a functional alternative to the Federation. Maybe not a good alternative, but an alternative, not a cartoon. This is best exemplified by the character of General Chang, the main villain of the film and arguably the best of all Star Trek villains (and there's a lot of competition there).

Chang is a highly educated man. He is well-acquainted with the works of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare/dp/B000WCWVDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare</a>, and actually appreciates them, whereas no human in this film knows anything about Klingon culture (not even their language, as we see in one scene). In other words, he carefully studies and respects his enemies. As befits an imperial officer, he has an aristocratic bearing. He often uses medievalist words like ""warrior,"" but that is clearly a show. His voice reveals his ironic enjoyment of theatrics; he's a refined man self-consciously playing up a barbarian image. His villainy is the product of a conscious decision that makes sense from his point of view; he's not just some unreasoning maniac, he's a lot more dangerous.

The Klingon leader, Gorkon, is the typical ""pro-reform candidate"" you see on TV, the Good Foreigner: idealistic, going against the opinions of his advisors and probably the general Klingon public as well. But he is assassinated early in the film, and succeeded by his daughter, a very different person. She is much more cautious and distrustful than her father, full of nationalist pride and keenly aware of national interests. She also believes in the necessity of reforms, and also goes against the hard-liners, but she will make sure that any eventual agreement is fair to her side.

At the same time, it also turns out that the conspiracy to disrupt the peace agreement involves Federation officers as well. The Federation has its own paranoid nationalists, who only want to humiliate and conquer the other side (which they view as ""the alien trash of the galaxy""). If&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronald-D-Moore/dp/B0036EH3UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronald D. Moore</a>&nbsp;had written the script, he would have tried to justify them. Fortunately, he did not write it, and the Enterprise crew takes a firmer moral stand; all the conspirators, human and Klingon, are unequivocally treated as villains. The writers deserve great credit -- they first create a morally ambiguous setting, and then still argue in favour of doing the right thing, instead of making ends-justify-the-means excuses. Gene Roddenberry allegedly disliked the film (he saw it shortly before his death), but I think it upholds the spirit of his vision better than any other Star Trek film.

There is a wealth of fine actors in the film. Mark Lenard isn't strictly necessary to the plot, but it's great to see Sarek in his diplomatic role, it makes the film just that little bit better. The other ambassadors, the Federation people (Brock Peters and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rene-Auberjonois/dp/B00062RCC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rene Auberjonois</a>), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Warner/dp/6305350205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Warner</a>&nbsp;as Gorkon are all great, as well. Kim Cattrall is excellent as the icy, reserved Valeris.

The regular crew also performs very well. The scenes aboard the Enterprise in the middle of the film make up a splendidly suspenseful detective story, as the crew urgently tries to piece together what happened, while Spock's unshakable composure holds them together. Shatner gives a great performance; when Kirk slowly comes to realize his prejudice against Klingons, you can see that it doesn't come easy, it requires a lot of gradual thought and effort from him. George Takei has a small part, but it is touching to see how Sulu risks the displeasure of his superiors just to help his old captain -- the theme of friendship was always the best aspect of the original series. Spock is at his all-time most human here; he's still impassive and collected, but he's moved far beyond his self-parodic obsession with logic. Here, he's kind of like Athos from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Musketeers/dp/B003WE9ZRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Musketeers</a>, compared to Kirk's cunning d'Artagnan.

If the film has a weakness, it's that McCoy doesn't get a lot to do. Somehow, the movies were never really able to fit him in well. Here, he gets a couple of great scenes when he desperately tries to save Gorkon, and then later at the trial. But after that, he's pretty much just there for the ride. Kirk does all the work of coming up with the escape plan. I think the writers made him go to the torpedo bay with Spock just to give him something to do. But, you know, he's a doctor, not an engineer. It feels awkward.

This is easily the most complex of all the Star Trek films, with the best portrayal of an alien culture. It is thought-provoking and brooding -- even the soundtrack helps to set the paranoid feel of the conspiracy. It should have been the last outing of the original crew. Unfortunately, commercial considerations prevailed, and Kirk was ignobly dealt with in the awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Generations/dp/6305181721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Generations</a>.

464269,2,630242335X,"Well it was.  Following along that old time tradition of labeling the odd-numbered Star Treks as inferior to the even-numbered ones, I set myself up for failure with the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, and got varying degrees of just that.

But I may have been far too generous in watching this film, due to its being even-numbered, and made by the same director who made Wrath of Khan.

I can't precisely point out just where or why, but this entire film felt like it was missing several hours of exposition, perhaps backstory from episodes of ""The Next Generation"" I never saw, and I end up feeling completely lost and confused, even in the face of the obvious.

The story claims to be some sort of ""Cold War in Space!"" idea, yet perhaps my being born in 1988 and never experiencing the Cold War leads me to not really understand this concept.  I can definitely see it, but I can't FEEL it.

The story involves some kind of planetary explosion that threatens to destroy the Klingon Empire, so a Klingon ambassador goes to the Federation to try to negotiate a lasting peace treaty and an opening of the two nations to work together and help them.  For reasons of ""DRAMA!"", Kirk is inexplicably racist against Klingons.  This is explained via that old Red Herring, David, his son who was killed by the Klingons.  In my original review for Search for Spock, I praised this as a show of Christopher Lloyd's Klingon guy's menace and its immediate effect on Kirk, which of course could not be as powerful as the loss of Spock, given that Kirk never really knew David.

But after watching the entire Original Series, and seeing Kirk's almost friendly relationship with enemy Klingons, this sudden fanatic, racist hatred of them in Star Trek VI really does seem to come out of nowhere.  I mirrored Spock in feeling sudden confusion and shock at Kirk's inexplicable hatred of Klingons.

And for some reason, I never really feel as though this hatred is anything more than a Red Herring, or otherwise a plot device that never really ends up fully utilized by the script.  He hates Klingons, yes, but this never in any way forces him to confront his racism or compromise his principles due to racism (or overcoming that racism), and in the end Kirk just handsomes his way through the events without really learning anything beyond the cheap and tawdry after-school special ""Well I know now that Klingons don't ALL really want to hurt us, so I'll stop being racist!"" message.

Racism is NOT a jealousy or a grudge or something cheap and tawdry that can be resolved by a single moment or sheer willpower.  It can definitely be world-changing for a racist to have someone of the other race do something for or to them to completely change their view, but this movie has nothing at all like that---there are no Klingons who really affect Kirk in this way, not even the ambassador who confides in Kirk, up to his own death.

The main storyline involves an assassination of the Ambassador by people dressed as Federation crewmembers, coming after the apparent attack on the Ambassador's ship by the Enterprise, though the Enterprise did not fire.  This leads to Kirk and McCoy being arrested by the Klingons (as they left the ship to go help the Ambassador afterwards) and them being sentenced to a prison planet after being incompetently defended by Colonel Worf (played by Michael Dorn, but not the same Worf as in TNG).

So we get an entire long and dreadfully dull sequence of Kirk and McCoy on a snowy prison planet, tangling with a shapeshifter, escaping, only to be betrayed by her and caught by the Klingons.

Meanwhile, Spock begins to uncover the conspiracy of the Ambassador's assassination, and for the life of me it just.. makes.. NO.. SENSE!!!

I fail to see the logic behind any of the motives behind the revealed conspirators, including a purely reverse-race based decision to cast the Admiral played by Brock Peters (who is black, btw) as the main racist against Klingons.  The documentaries I saw seemed to vaguely imply that this decision was made based on some sort of attempt to show racism in an ironic sort of light, given that the black guy is one of the highest ranking people in Starfleet and is racist against similar brown (alien) people.

But the entire thing just makes NO SENSE!  So he's racist, but WHY does he want to assassinate the Ambassador?  Is he looking to provoke war with the Klingons?  If so, WHY?  Unless the Klingons are as stupid as they've been gradually shaped into being (as in, from TOS slick and smarmy clever bastards to TNG proud warrior race guys who hold honor above reason), then there's no concievable way the Federation could go to war with the Klingons and expect not to be horribly butchered, even if they win the war.  Maybe the Romulans would emerge and smash the shattered remnants of the Federation?  Maybe the Dominion would launch a lightning strike against them?

There's a thousand and eight logical and rational reasons NOT to go to war with the Klingons, but the racism against the Klingons is played up to a fanatical degree that is not only arbitrary (as the characters involved in this conspiracy, without revealing their identities, have absolutely nothing in their brief backstory or personality to support or justify this) but they seem to be incapable of realizing that THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE MAJORITY OF THE KLINGONS WANT!

Why else would General Chang, played by Christopher Plummer (who absolutely has a damn BLAST playing this guy, and hams it up so much he chews up more scenery than Shatner in three Star Trek films) and his group be working so closely with the heads of STARFLEET COMMAND to do this?

Star Trek Deep Space Nine had an episode called ""In the Pale Moonlight"" about how, in the midst of the Dominion War, the Federation was losing horribly.  Casualties mounted every day, and the crew of Deep Space Nine could look horribly forward to looking through the daily casualties to find the names of friends, family, and loved ones killed in the war.  This leads to Captain Sisko facing a crisis, as the Romulans have a high-ranking Senator looking to persuade the Empire to joining the Dominion in crushing the Federation.

So Sisko has a Cardassian spy work with a forger to create a false holo-recording of top Dominion officials apparently scheming to secretly attack the Romulans while they're recovering from a botched attack on the Federation before.  They hope to use this lie to bring the Romulans in against the Dominion.

Unfortunately, that Senator recognizes its a fake, and leaves to go back to Romulus, undoubtedly with renewed hatred for the Federation for this latest attempt.  Instead, the Cardassian spy has his ship blow up, making it look like a Dominion job, and ensuring the Romulans will find the fake holorecording.

Sisko realizes he has the blood of the Senator and others on his hands now, as he has betrayed Starfleet principles by engaging in shady dealings, bribery, threats, and indirect murder.  And yet he can live with it because he did what he thought was right, and the war will soon turn with the Romulans to reinforce the Federation side.

This episode created immense controversy, as detractors claimed it went completely against Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek as a peaceful, utopian future of exploration and diplomacy.

And it was one of the highest rated Star Trek episodes ever.

Shockingly, there's no such similar controversy about this movie, in which Starfleet ADMIRALS (and not just Captains) are in on a conspiracy to assassinate not only a Klingon Ambassador, but the FEDERATION PRESIDENT not out of any righteous need to end a losing war or stop a killing spree or crime, but to CAUSE a losing war, a killing spree, a crime.  They seek to unleash a war between the Federation and the Klingons in which undoubtedly the Klingons would lose... and kill MILLIONS if not BILLIONS of Federation soldiers and civilians.

And all because of racism/hatred that up until then had never made itself even slightly known, and even when it was revealed, did not make a lick of sense.

Also, it was pretty boring.",1268006400,2,8122,4.757662152530292
464270,4,630242335X,"After the commercial and critical EPIC failure of part 5, they almost stopped the franchise.  They had several ideas for a new movie, possibly a new series.  They almost greenlit a prequel called Starfleet Academy, but the project was shelved (although they did take some ideas from it for the 2009 reboot).  Leonard Nimoy then came up with an idea for a sixth movie.  He asked ""what if the wall came down in outer space?""  He was referring to the events of the cold war.  So they decided to follow his suggestion and produce a sixth Star Trek movie.  Many people consider this one of the best Star Trek movies, and some people consider to be on the same level as ""Wrath of Khan"".  I like this movie, but I don't like it as much as parts two or four.  It think it is about on the same level as Search for Spock.  It's a good Star Trek movie, but there are better.

The movie takes place a few years after the events of part five.  In the time since the last movie, Sulu has been given his own command, the starship Excelsior.  Also, the crew of the Enterprise is a few weeks away from retirement.  The events of the previous movie are not even mentioned.  It's like they were saying ""well, we really screwed up last time.  We'll just pretend like that movie never happened, okay?""  And that's fine with me.  They try to carry on the themes from the trilogy, which was a wise move on their part.  The movie opens with Sulu and the Excelsior discovering that a Klingon moon has exploded.  The moon, Praxis, was the Klingon empire's key energy production facility, and the Klingon Empire is now thrown into turmoil.  They request a peace treaty with the Federation.  Kirk and the Enterprise are ordered to meet with Chancellor Gorkon and escort him to earth.  This is difficult for Kirk, seeing as how his son David was killed by Klingon's a few years earlier.  Nevertheless, Kirk tries to be polite to the Klingons, and has them aboard the Enterprise for dinner, in a great, comical scene.  Kirk meets Gorkon's daughter Azetbur, and his chief of staff General Chang.  Chang seems particularly interested in Kirk, seeing him as fellow warrior.

As they near earth, the Enterprise suddenly appears to fire on the Klingon ship.  Then two men in space suits beam onto the Klingon ship.  They kill several Klingons, including Gorkon.  Kirk beams over to the Klingon ship, and he and McCoy are sent to a prison planet.  They later escape and try to figure out who framed them.  They deduce that it was not the Enterprise who attacked Gorkon' ship, it was a Klingon ship that can fire while cloaked.  The two men who beamed over to the Klingon ship and killed Gorkon were two Enterprise officers.  Kirk and crew uncover a plot to stop the peace talks.  They plan another execution at the peace conference.  They head to the peace conference to intervene, but are intercepted by Chang and the cloaked bird of prey.  He fires on the Enterprise, severely injuring it.  Spock and McCoy modify a torpedo which tracks the invisible bird of prey and blows it up.  Then they beam down to the peace conference just in time to save the Federation president from being assassinated.  All charges against Kirk and his crew are dropped, and they are ordered to return home.  However, they decide to go on one final cruise before they are decomissioned.

As I said before, this is a satisfying end to the first series of Star Trek movies.  It has Kirk once again having to deal with getting old.  He also has to get over his own bigotry and accept what is happening with the Klingons.  I don't think this movie is one of the best Trek movies, but it is still a great movie and a great sendoff for the crew of the original series.",1264723200,,3706,4.490254872563718

This time around, the Federation discovers their most hated enemy, the Klingons, are facing extinction. They set about wanting to make a peace pact with them, however reluctantly. Captain Kirk, who lost his son, David, to the murderous hand of the Klingons in ""Search for Spock"" definitely wants nothing to do with his foes. ""Let Them Die"" he says to Spock. Anyway, after a dinner meeting with Klingon representatives, their chancellor is assassinated, and Kirk and McCoy are framed. From this point on, the film takes on the tone of a detective story, with Spock and the rest of the Enterprise crew racing against time to clear their allies' names and find the true killer before all out war devastates the galaxy.

Echoing the tense relationship between the US and the USSR towards the end of the Cold War, this one has a lot of very personal resonance for anyone who remembers those times. Klingon High Chancellor Gorkon was even named by combining the names of Gorbachev and Lincoln.

The metaphor here presented shows the dangers of prejudice even with the threat of peace. Note the incredibly charged statements by even the Federation ""good guy"" characters as they have a hard time accepting that this long-standing conflict may be coming to a kind of end. In fact, the statements that are made by Admiral Cartwright took Brock Peters several takes to get through because they were so offensive to him. He understood the need to get them out, though, because the movie only really works when you are forced to re-evaluate your assumptions: that we are the good guys and ""they"" are the bad guys.

There are some great action sequences and some wonderful (for the time) special effects. But it is the story that is just superb and that does not age the same way all other aspects of the movie do. It is still as poignant today as it was when it came out.

*Storyline is smashing.  Much darker, more dramatic than before.  Lots of interesting political intruigue and mystery.

*Characters are great; acting is good.
*Writing is good.  A few memorable lines, and a few bits of dry humor that doesn't take away too much from the serious storyline.
*Strong themes about the uncertainty of the future (hence the Shakespearean motif).

464338,5,630242335X,"Following on the heals of the train wreck that was `The Final Frontier', `The Undiscovered Country' was the last chance for the original Star Trek cast to go out on a high note. Undiscovered is probably the most underrated of all the Star Trek movies in fact I would probably rate it just below `The Wrath of Khan' in terms of quality. It's also probably the truest representation of Gene Rodenberry's vision of overcoming prejudice and bigotry.

The movie is written as an allegory for the breakup of the Soviet Union that was occurring at the time and the disaster at Chernobyl. The message of the film is important and remains relevant even decades later. It is the ongoing debate between those who saw a single superpower world as an opportunity for the U.S. to cast aside restraints and take a more active, aggressive role in world affairs. On the other side are those who saw a tremendous opportunity for peace and a draw down of forces. At the time the world was just starting a dramatic rearrangement of power while today the reverberations include ideas like the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive strikes, the flaunting of international laws by the United States and the burgeoning budget of the U.S. armed forces. The hawks are definitely in charge.

There is also a subtext of racism with a subtle implication that Klingon's are sort of the American blacks of alien cultures. Note the `Guess who's coming to dinner' comment by Chekov. This is the most controversial part of the movie since the Klingon's have always been portrayed as crude and warlike. However, in keeping with the spirit of Rodenberry there is, of course, mutual understanding between humans and Klingon's before the final credits roll.

One of the great things about this movie is the decision to have Kirk initially side with the war hawks calling for putting the boots to the Klingons. He utters a classic line when discussing the future of the Klingon race saying, `Let them die'. Captain Kirk is generally portrayed as the squeaky clean hero so it was a bold stroke to write him with such bitterness and vengeance but perfectly understandable given the events of the previous movies. In fact the entire crew of the Enterprise comes off as rather snobbish and condescending towards their Klingon guests but that was the point of the movie. It's about growth and acceptance.

Christopher Plummer is fantastic as the Shakespeare quoting General Chang. His is one of the most indelible characters ever in Star Trek and the battle between The Enterprise and Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey was an absolute classic with a satisfying finale. I have to admit the movies ending was a bit hokey but `The Undiscovered Country' is a fine send off for the original cast and a great movie.",1216684800,2,2751,4.809725158562368
464339,4,630242335X,"Wow, what an improvement over the previous Star Trek film: Star Trek V:The Final Frontier, but we won't even get into that.  The Undiscovered Country is one of the best Star Trek films out of the current 10 film franchise, with its only competition including Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan (my personal favorite), Star Trek IV:The Voyage Home (the non-trekkie favorite) and Star Trek:First Contact (almost everyone's favorite), however, there are plenty that say the 6th and final film featuring the TOS cast is the best, and it is certainly a strong and fullfilling end for the TOS cast (unfortunately the same cannot be said about the more recent TNG cast).

This one takes itself seriously, with a strong story of diplomacy, faith, and the fear of change (the future - which the Klingon Chancellor refers to as the Undiscovered Country).  Of course any trekkie will pickup on every little Trek detail thrown into the movie and will make the experience that much better (especially references to Kirk's son's death, which took place in Star Trek III).  However, the film can still be enjoyed and understood for any movie-goer, though will probably come off more as good entertainment and nothing else (but nothing wrong with that).

The story revolves around the Klingons, and as tiring as they were starting to become (no Romulan stories in the films until the 10th entry), Undiscovered Country brought forth a great story that was refreshing as much as the new looks of some of the Klingons....the film even won an award for best makeup.  General Chang (Christopher Plummer) is a great example, with the most unique look to this day of any Klingon, sporting an eye patch and a tiny ponytail...its almost a pirate look at times, but he pulls it off with ease and it works.

The action in this film holds up well to this day, and a cloaked Bird-of-Prey firing torpedoes at a helpless Enterprise still gives me chills.  There isn't an overabundance of action at all, in fact, you might say there isn't a lot, but the film never needed it.  The final battle is a solid couple of minutes of the very climactic showdown between General Chang and Kirk, both aboard their ships.  One after another, Chang sends torpedoes through the Enterprise's hull while quoting Shakespeare.  The effects are great, especially for 1991, and such a huge welcome after Final Froniter's laughable attempts with effects.

Trekkie or not, this is a great film that holds up very well that should not be missed.  The pacing is wonderful, as is the story and the subject matter at hand.  There is great dialouge, humor, action, effects, and a villain that is one of Trek's most memorable.  This is one fun and entertaining ride that feels complete.

It has all the good elements of a good tale as well:  False accusations, wrongful imprisonment, a (not so daring) rescue, suspicions aplenty, and turncoats to keep the plot interesting.  It ends in somewhat of a race to find out the conspiracy behind the murder before something terrible happens (not to spoil anything), so it does keep you on edge.

All in all, an outstanding film.  If I could rate it 4.5 stars instead of 4, I certainly would.  Why not 5?  Because that represents 'perfection' to me, and only a handful of movies fall under that category.

464343,4,630242335X,"With the previous two Star Trek films being the weakest so far in the series (in my humble opinion), this next film really had no choice but to be better. And in fact, this film was better, much better. Good enough to give Star Trek II a run for its money as being the best of the Star Trek films. Finally, we have a classic Star Trek plot involving the long time villainous Klingons attempting to make peace with the Federation and non-trusting Kirk and crew are sent to collect a Klingon chancellor so he may meet with Federation members on Earth, however when the chancellor is assassinated, Kirk and company are blamed and held as prisoners. Thankfully, the humor that was predominate in previous films was cut down to a great deal, and the original crew seems wonderfully in sync again. Nicolas Meyer (who directed Wrath of Khan) returns to the director's chair to pilot the original Star Trek crew's last adventure, and does an excellent job. And though Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner gave good efforts as directors of the previous 3 Star Trek films, Meyer brings something more to the series, or perhaps he just has good timing of showing up and directing these movies when there actually a good story behind them. In any case, this is a good film and a wonderfully fitting end for the original Star Trek crew. If you're like me, and felt that the last couple of Star Trek films had dropped the ball, you should be happy to know that this one picks the ball back up and runs with it!!! Its a definite buy, and all the great special features included with it, is just icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned!!",1192406400,,1620,4.494915254237288

As far as the movie itself - I remember going to see it on the opening weekend, and probably the most memorable and entertaining part of the experience was the local chapter of Serious Trekkies had their own section of the theater roped off, and the place was just swarming with people in spandex and velcro shoes. As far as the movie itself, its probably one of the worst Star Trek films, though it is just about cheesy enough to be entertaining in its own right.

464377,5,630242335X,"One last adventure with the beloved crew members of the Star Ship Enterprise. And what a way to go out. This is a great way to end a saga, and a very enjoyable film. Sometimes by the time you get to a part 6 of any movie series it has gotten to the point where its dull and not half of what it used to be. This movie though is anything but those things.

This movie is all about bringing the hatred between the Earth run Starfleet and the Klingon Empire to a long over due end. Mostly due to the fact that one of the Klingon moons was destroyed in a freak explosion. Now desperate for help to restore the balance, the Klingons reach out to the human run Federation for peace and Captain Kirk and his loyal crew are volunteered by Mr. Spock to be peace officials to welcome in the soon to be Klingon friends.

What both sides don't count on is the hatred that each still have for each other and how some will stop at nothing to make sure that peace doesn't happen. When the Enterprise fires on the Klingon ship after a peaceful meeting the Klingons take it as an act of war, even though the Enterprise didn't fire on them. Kirk and McCoy go over to try and help the injured leader of the Klingons and are arrested for the murder of him and sentenced to life on a prison camp. Now its up to Spock and Sulu who is now Captain of his own ship to figure out who was really behind this, rescue Kirk and McCoy and save the fragile peace conference that is still in danger from the would be killers before all out war breaks out. It is a true thought provoking and typical Star Trek type adventure that we have come to expect from the series and this movie doesn't disappoint on delivering that and more.

After the very disappointing Part V, it was refreshing to see the crew back to their old ways of fun and adventure and giving the proper send off the original Enterprise gang deserved. We have classic moments of Kirk fighting some huge alien while he is in the prison camp and a mystery that Spock has to solve while running out of precious time. It is almost part adventure and part mystery and all fun with barely a dull moment to be found within. The characters are as fresh and lively as ever, even as the actors themselves seem to age, the characters only seem to get better. Everyone seemed to have a vital part this go around and show that they aren't ready for the scrap heap just yet.

This is epic in that it is not only the last time all the original Star Trek actors will be together but that it bridges a lot of things together in the Star Trek universe as it shows the point that Earth and the Klingons finally reached towards peace. And opens up the path for the Next Generation that was ongoing at the same time of this movie's release. The only real drawbacks to the film were that Sulu's absence from the Enterprise did seem a bit out of place and some of the story moments seemed a bit rushed and far fetched at point ie) how easily they escaped prison and how quickly they were able to wrap things up at the end.

This movie is highly recommended to anyone into the Star Trek series and even those who aren't should be able to follow the fun story easy enough. Part VI is easily up there with one of the better movies in the long going series of films and for good reason. It has a lot of hidden messages in it as well as most Star Trek situations seem to have under lying meanings that one can relate to a real world situation. So the cold war type of political feeling that this movie had along with the racism aspects that were felt did hit home to a real life situation that I'm sure most could relate to. It was a pretty deep story while at the same time a fun adventure.

One last trip around the solar system with Kirk and crew and it was the perfect send off for each and every one of them. All good things must come to an end and thankfully this was a most fitting end and one that I think you will all enjoy watching many a time and get something different from it each time you do.

May the Enterprise-A live on forever.",1173657600,7,4049,4.170076726342711
464378,5,630242335X,"The Star Trek movies have had a roller coaster trend.  There was the first movie which was like the ""2001"" of the series (which is adequately acceptable - I still like it).  Then came the classic Wrath of Khan, and its pristine follow-ups of Search for Spock, and Voyage Home.  Star Trek the Final Frontier wasn't great at all, let's leave it at that.  So came this movie to redeem Kirk and crew.

The movie literally begins with a BANG.  Sulu is off as captain of the Excelsior (a ship he's always craved), and along the way his ship gets in a tangle with a shockwave of an exploded Klingon moon - which is essentially the most vital resource the Klingons have.  Months later at a briefing, Capt. Kirk finds himself vouched and volunteered by Spock to escort the Klingon chancellor to Earth for a peace conference.  Keep in mind Kirk is not too fond with the Klingons, especially since they killed his son some time ago.  The two meet up for a dinner aboard the Enterprise , which doesn't go too well exactly.  Then later on after it's over, the Klingon ship is fired on, leaving it with no gravity, then two figures beam on the ship and kill the Chancellor.  Kirk and Enterprise are left with the blame and Kirk and Dr. McCoy are arrested, held trial, and sentenced to life on a tundra mining outpost.  While there, Spock and crew look over the Enterprise to find all the bread crumbs that would lead to those responsible for the attack.  It seems all around there are those, from Starfleet, to Klingon that don't exactly go well with the idea of peace moving forward, and they'll do what it takes to prevent it - even if it involves a deadlier Bird of Prey, and another assassination attempt.

Yeah, a sci-fi movie not only being true to being sci-fi, but getting even more serious.  All of the performers of the Enterprise crew, as well as Sulu (who is now a captain as mentioned), play their revered characters as they are known to be.  Plus, add the robust performance by Christopher Plummer as the rogue Klingon Chang, which easily rivals Patrick Stewarts Picard in different dimensions.

The picture transfer is really a marvel, and most interesting on the widescreen frame being different - but that's because the movie was shot in 70MM.  About every scene looks amazing.  Same goes for the 5.1 sound, it has an aural depth to it.  Everything in the scene is directionally placed.  Special note goes out to the Cliff Eidelman, whose score is not only different in all regards in the movies, but truly a gem to hear on how it sets the mood just right.

I'm not going to go deep into the extras, there's plenty to go around and ask for seconds.

That said, I put my endorsement on this kickass DVD.  It's one of those special editions that is treated very special.",1172102400,3,2771,4.507014028056112
464379,5,630242335X,"This movie is the last of the movies with the original Star Trek cast (unless you count ""Generations""), and can arguably be the best (though a case can be made for ""Wrath Of Kahn"" and ""The Voyage Home"" as well).  It sets things up for the time of the Next Generation, with the preludes of peace between the Klingons and the Federation.  It is interesting that there is a conspiracy to keep it from happening with Klingons, humans, and Vulcans involved.

464381,5,630242335X,"""Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country"" is my favorite ST film.  Although I've only recently started watching the original series on G4 and TV Land, I've always had more of an attachment to the original crew than any of the others.  Since watching the old series, I've grown to love the original crew even more.  In ""The Undiscovered Country,"" our heroes find themselves on the edge of a brand new world in which the Klingons actually want (or for protection's sake, need) peace.  Naturally, Captain Kirk wants nothing to do with the Klingons on this matter.  However, Spock has ""volunteered"" the Enterprise to be the escort for the Klingon party to the new peace talks.  Things go wrong when the Chancellor Gorkon, the primary Klingon representative, is murdered on his own ship and it was seemingly done at the hand of the Enterprise.  What follows is a Klingon trial for Kirk and Bones, imprisonment on a Klingon penal mine planet, and Spock and the rest of the gang trying to uncover what's really going on.  It's a wonderful space mystery that I enjoy every time I see it.

As for the DVD, it's a nice edition to anyone's collection.  It's full of nice documentaries ranging from a tribute to DeForest Kelley to a neat little segment known as ""Penny's Toybox"" in which we get to take a look at some of the props used in the film.  It was refreshing to see that not one of these documentaries (over three hours worth) included the typical self-serving bits as many DVDs include.  Ironically, this particular film could actually get away with documentaries where the crew pats themselves on the back, because this is one of the best ""Trek"" flicks ever.

A wonderful send off to a wonderful space opera.  Highly recommended.",1165363200,5,1728,4.713333333333333

464413,5,630242335X,"""Only Nixon could go to China.""  Seems like an odd way for me to start off a review for a movie, especially when that movie is an entry into the venerable `Star Trek' franchise.  However, here is why this quote is appropriate, it happens to be a quote that Spock (Leonard Nimoy) uses in the film, and also serves as the inspiration for the basic storyline for the film, in which Kirk (William Shatner) must lead the Federation in an historical moment in the universe, when the Klingons and the Federation make an effort for peace.  Though the story seems intriguing enough, can this latest effort in the franchise overcome the disappointment left over from ""Star Trek 5:  The Final Frontier""?  Apparently the executives over at Paramount felt the franchise was still strong enough to survive, and the gamble paid off many times over as ""Star Trek 6:  The Undiscovered Country"" redeemed the franchise in the eyes of the fans and at the box office.

""Star Trek 6:  The Undiscovered Country"" finds the Enterprise and her crew fighting for peace in the galaxy between the crumbling Klingon empire and the Federation.  After years of war, the Klingons are left in a weakened state and have nowhere else to turn except to the Federation, however to make the peace the Federation must send the one man whose presence holds such respect and power that he could lead the two factions to peace.  That man is Captain Kirk (William Shatner), but can Kirk put aside his hatred for the Klingons after what happened on the Genesis planet, when a renegade Klingon murdered his son.  Agreeing to put aside his differences, begrudgingly I might add, Kirk sets out to be the ambassador for the Federation by meeting with a high-ranking Klingon official.  All goes well until the Klingon ship comes under attack, and the Klingon official is murdered, and Captain Kirk is left with the blame.  Now, not only is Kirk on trial for his life, along with that of Dr. McCoy's (DeForrest Kelley), but he must also try to prove his innocence and still ensure that peace reigns between the Klingons and the Federation.

After a dismal outing with the William Shatner directed ""Star Trek 5:  The Final Frontier"", it wouldn't have been all that surprising if Paramount had decided not to proceed with any further adventures of the starship Enterprise, at least not with the current cast.  But, thankfully Paramount thought better of letting the current crew die out, and instead brought them back for a proper farewell adventure that deals with, in a very mature way, the ramifications of the events in ""Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock"".  Forcing Kirk to deal with his hatred of Klingons, and demanding he lead the Federation to peace with the race he despises most, this was a true stroke of genius on the part of the writers.  The writing is another improvement in this installment, after skipping out on the previous movie Nicholas Meyer reunited with Harve Bennett to craft this perfect ending to the adventures of the original crew of the starship Enterprise.  Not only did Nicholas Meyer co-write the film, he also found himself in the director's chair yet again, he previously directed ""Star Trek 2:  The Wrath of Khan"", and even though it had been some time since he directed this type of film, it was clear he hadn't lost a beat, instead his directing ability had substantially improved.  The cast, which is comprised of the usual suspects from the previous films, are all very solid in their roles, and there is a distinct feeling of relief and closure with this being the final film for this particular cast.  On a side note look for a cameo of Michael Dorn (Worf on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") as the Klingon lawyer defending Kirk and McCoy, just a little bit of trivia for those that may not have noticed.

If you were one of the many fans who were turned off by the previous installment in the franchise, and was leery about this latest film, have no fear ""Star Trek 6:  The Undiscovered Country"" puts the franchise back on the right track, and serves as a terrific finale for the original crew of the Enterprise.

""Star Trek 6:  The Undiscovered Country"" is rated PG for violence and language.",1151280000,3,4184,4.712912087912088
464414,5,630242335X,"This is the first in this series of collectors STAR  TREK films that I have bought and/or seen.

Visually the outer package restores some elements that have not been seen since the original film. However, I guess I was expecting a booklet, but no matter since the second DVD has an equivalent version in a collection of stills.

If you buy this as one who has seen previous editions of the film, in VHS, and DVD, then the quality will totally blow you away. The immaculate detail is just superb.

On a 5.1  sound system, the effect is awesome, and on a DVI input monitor, totally great.

The person coming newly to this film will be impressed as well, and maybe perhaps a little overwhelmed.

When I first saw these Special Collectors edition, it was in a full set that had I think up to Generations in it. Costing around 120 dollars at a higher priced video  store.

Anyways, the story is given in other reviews here. The impressive part is the care in the extras, the insight into the making of the film, and thankfully, Nicholas Meyers does not behave in the same manner he did in the commentary on TIME AFTER TIME ( 1979).

464415,4,630242335X,"""Star Trek VI"" is the film that redeemed the disappointing reactions that the fifth movie drew out of loyal fans.  I for one, enjoyed that movie, even though it's my least favorite...but that's another debate for another review.

After the Klingon moon Praxis explodes and permanently damages the atmosphere of the Kronos, the Klingon home planet, peace talks begin between the Federation and their longtime-nemeses.  The bitter and deeply-resentful Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is chosen to lead the soon-to-be-retired Enterprise crew for one last mission, that is to escort Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner in a wonderful brief role) to Earth.  After an embarrasing dinner-in-space between the two races concludes, and many of the crew members are more-than-buzzed, the Klingon vessel is attacked.  Since the Enterprise was the only within range of the Klingon vessel, Kirk and Dr. McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley) agree to surrender themselves and suffer the consequences, in hopes of saving the peace talks.  There's just one catch: Who indeed attacked the Klingon vessel?

What unfolds is a mystery sci-fi adventure, where multiple tales intertwine.  There's the tension on Earth between interplantery diplomats, Kirk and McCoy's struggle to survive their prison sentence, Captain Sulu's (George Takei as a former Enterprise crew member) dilemma between following orders or assisting his former starship-captain, Captain Spock's (Leonard Nimoy) sponsorship and mentoring of another promising Vulcan (Kim Cattrall in a very good performance), and finally the Enterprise's investigation of the conspiracy.  This is an unusually complex story for ""Star Trek"" movies, which typically focus on two threads at most.  Nicholas Meyer was brought back to helm this movie; a wise choice considering he directed what is widely-considered the best of all ""Trek"" films - ""Star Trek II"" (I agree with that praise).

I love these movies, and have revisited all of the movies' Two-Disc DVDs from ""The Motion Picture"" to ""Nemesis"".  In ""The Undiscovered Country"", I've come to admire the colorful characters, fantastic visual and sound effects, and a metaphoric tale that addresses the dangers of prejudice and racism...out of ten films, ""Star Trek VI"" is one of the boldest.

I've also noticed a few shortcomings in each movie.  In this film, one of them is a DVD-exclusive edit, where a brief flashback technique is used as the names of the conspirators are revealed.  I won't reveal which scene that is, but those who've viewed the film know which one I'm talking about.  It's not a huge deal, but it's distracting and doesn't fit the visual style of the rest of the movie.  Another criticism applies to the entire movie - It's too rushed!  For example, the trials of Kirk and McCoy have no sense of time.  Did it all occur within a day?  Did it span across a few days?  It was a ""show trial"", but either a lot of ground was covered and not given enough screentime, or General Chang (Christopher Plummer as a Gorkon's chief-of-staff) was an overly-gifted prosecutor and Colonel Worf (Michael Dorn in an underused role) was the most useless defense attorney in the galaxy.  I'm leaning towards the 'lack-of-screentime' theory.  Another case is the time spent on Rhua Penthe, the prison planet that Kirk and McCoy are sentenced to.  They spend very little time there before they figure out some key puzzles of the conspiracy, get into a few scuffles, and escape their doomed future.  The screenplay, which even creator Gene Roddenberry had objections to, had a labyrinth of ideas and character studies that could've been expanded.  Yet, the ideas come off as preachy, and the mystery is a little too easy to figure out.  I know Roddenberry wanted ""Star Trek"" and his vision of the future to be accessible to all viewers; I agree with that, but cinema is the medium to expand visual art into another realm, not simply to make simple art look prettier.

Nevertheless, this is a very good film, in spite of all of its flaws.  The idea of prejudice and acceptance is one of the bravest ""Star Trek"" has tackled; this sixth entry portrays that concept with an adventuruous mystery with some Shakespearen flavor, outstanding special effects, breath-taking suspense, and a heart-warming farewell from the original Enterprise crew.

This ""Trek"" movie is definitely worth checking out, thanks to this spectacular DVD treatment.  The Extras are all worth watching, and the commentaries (both the Text trivia track and Audio track) are insightful and the best of the ""Star Trek"" DVDs.

All-in-all, I would like the film to be more than it is.  But I enjoy it a lot, and the Extras are some of the best in the ""Star Trek"" Collection.  Science fiction fans and Trekkers will love this one.",1142294400,,4773,5.069142125480154

ST VI was extremely long, involved lots of ""commentary"" dialogue (where the writer seemed to be extrememly concerned that we all think him well-read and intelligent), and not much plot movement.

It would have made a better episode, with some tight editing,

The best part of the movie is the last 15 minutes when the incredibly obvious ""secret plot"" is finally revealed, and the Enterprise shoots the modified photon torpedo at the ""To be or not to be"" captain.

It's almost enough to wash the taste of Star Trek V out of your mouth.  Bringing back Nicholas Meyer (from Wrath of Khan) to direct is the first thing they got right.  Both of Meyer's Trek films seem to have deeper themes than any of the other Trek films.  ""Khan"" dealt with the aging crew and fears of death.  ""Country"" deals with the line between peace and prejudice.  While Khan is the clearly better film, ""Country"" is effective at it's least successful times and quite good at it's most.

Every schoolchild knows that the Klingons are just the wrinkly-foreheaded, intergalactic cousins of Soviets, so it's natural that, since the Wall came down in real life, the Wall would come down in the Trek universe.  Of course, the Enterprise crew is put on the most important assignment of escorting the Klingon leader to negotiations.  And, of course, things don't go down so well.  It's up to Kirk to see through his prejudices to kick the asses in the way of peace.  The ending's hoaky but gloriously fun to anyone into Trek.  If you can hold back a smile when Scotty busts in, what kind of green-blooded, pointy-eared lamebrain are you?

Finally, the series restores what was missing with Trek 4 and 5. This film has mystery, humor, good effects, intrigue and action.

The Characters are once again ""fleshed out"" very well, especially Kirk and McCoy. Christopher Plummer's character is shrewd and cunning, a ""Kahn"" in Klingon garb.

The cinematography and backdrops are beautiful, complete with a glacier landscape and a high Klingon court room.

The battle scenes are well done, and tense! The only complaint here would be the ILM effects... they decided to abandon the old Enterprise model that had a massive amount of interior lighting (called ""running lights""), and instead illuminated the new model with a strong exterior source (like the sun). Unfortunately, the exterior lighting DOES make the ship look like a plastic model!

Other than that, the effects are excellent. The soundtrack is dramatic, and the film never gets dull.

464421,5,630242335X,"Let me start off by saying that watching the last scene of this movie was hard because it was so well done and it just left you wanting even more from the original crew of the Enterprise in their final performance. Everyone of the cast lived up to the legacy that they had built for themselves and I think it was painful for everyone watching the last scene where the crew say their goodbyes.

The plot revolves around a peace negotiation with the Klingons that goes down a bad path when some of the Klingon officers are murdered and Kirk and Bones are put on trial for their murder. TNG's Michael Dorn represents them as Col. Worf (TNG's Worf's grandfather) which is pretty funny and a great way to have a ""crossover"" between the two series. Kirk and McCoy are sent to a mining facility to live out their lives mining and of course run into trouble by the locals who want to murder them. Spock as usual finds a way to bail his friends out and the Enterprise crew saves the day once again. The movie ends with a sentimental ending and the final captain's log.

One of the great things that Star Trek does with its DVDs is it includes great bonus features and the two disc special addition is worth it for any fan. It also contains a tribute to the late Deforest Kelly who died in 1999. Not only does Michael Dorn appear but future member of the Star Trek universe Rene Auberjonois also makes an appearance.

It helps to connect the original series with The Next Generation, and its dark, militaristic atmosphere really set it apart. Plus, Nicholas Meyer, the man who brought The Wrath of Khan to life, is sitting in the director's chair once again.

The movie is a great commentary on prejudice, and portrays a great parallel to the fall of the Soviet Union when the Klingon Empire reaches out to the Federation. The set design is great, as are the special effects and makeup. The character of Martia has a wonderfully distinctive avian look, and General Chang stands out from the rest of the Klingons, not just in his sleek, hairless appearance, but also in his habit of quoting and paraphrasing Shakespeare (whose Hamlet provided the movie's title).

Some appearances worth noting are Michael Dorn, playing an ancestor of his character Worf, and Rene Auberjonois, later known for his role as Constable Odo, plays a Starfleet officer named Colonel West.

464474,4,630242335X,"Not a great movie, ""Undiscovered Country"" is still great enough among Trek flicks to be unmissable.  A tight script, great acting and razor-sharp direction not only make ""Undiscovered Country"" an unstoppable ride, but also iron out how entertaining Trek could be in the right hands.

THE PLOT: UC hints at the fall of the Soviet empire - replacing the Klingons (perennial baddies in Trek) with the luckless Russians of our age.  When the story starts, the Klingons have suffered a Chernobyl-style industrial accident that bankrupts them.  Forced to sue for peace, the Klingons find mixed reactions from the humans, some of whom would feel safer negotiating with the Klingons after they collapsed.  Inviting disaster (or maybe obeying the Vulcan dictum that ""Only Nixon could go to China"") Earth sends Captain Kirk to escort Gorkcon (David Warner), the Klingons' visionary Chancellor to peace talks.  Kirk, having nursed his own grudge against the Klingons for killing his son (as everybody knows, this happened in Trek-III) feels dragooned into the mission (he was recommended by Spock).  Determined to go anyway, Kirk is blindsided when the Klingons are attacked - apparently by the Enterprise - and Gorckon murdered.  With Kirk arrested and tried by the Klingons, Spock tries to uncover the conspiracy responsible for Gorckon's murder, save the Captain and prevent another assassination which may doom hopes for peace forever.

No matter how many times I try to summarize UC, it never gets much thicker than the above - but UC excels anyway.  The old-show characters have never worked better off each other.  The script bravely transcends Trekkie sentimentality: at one point, it looks like the end of the Spock/Kirk friendship, as Kirk nearly lets his hatred of the Klingons get in the way of Spock's better sense; we even get the specter of a rather malicious Kirk - ""let them die"" he says of the desperate Klingons.  Direction here eschews the bland smoothness of ""The Next Generation"" - scene transitions and music add to the character.  And technobabble?  None here.  Beside the usual characters, the script tosses in some meaty newcomers - the late Brock Peters in an underwritten but juicy role as a bellicose Federation officer, a younger Kim Cattral as a sweetly sexy Vulcan and Christopher Plummer as a barely regenerate Klingon cold warrior, who spouts Shakespeare in Klingonese as he confronts his enemies.

Secondly, I'm sorry...but there is no way that an alien race such as the Klingons would know Shakespeare.

Especially since, every single time there is a chance for peace, some new attack on the part of anyone over there derails whatever progress is made.

464527,5,630242335X,"THE STORY: Peace negotiations between the Federation and Klingon Empire are interrupted by the assassination of a Klingon high official; Captain Kirk is blamed and thus he & McCoy get sentenced to an alien mining penal colony.

Like many of the original TV episodes which incorporated the important issues of the day into a futuristic space story, ""Star Trek VI"" (1991) is a morality play about the wall coming down in outer space, with the Klingons standing in for the Soviets. Nice moral about how radical change can be really scary -- there are some who are able to embrace it and others who have serious difficulty with it. In this case there are adverse reactions on both sides by those who believe they have too much invested in the present state of hostility.

HIGHLIGHTS: Watch out for the ravishing Kim Cattrall playing Vulcan Lieutenant Valeris. She adequately proves that sex appeal is not necessarily about nudity and flirtation, as Valeris is fully clothed and maintains a demeanor of sophistication the entire film. The formal dinner with the Klingons is also a highlight; it's reminiscent of Khan's powerful dinner scene from ""Space Seed."" When the dinner party ends and the Klingons beam away, each Enterprise crewmember shares a fitting exclamation of relief, including Scotty's ""Thank God!"" and McCoy's ""I'm going to go find a pot of BLACK coffee."" After everyone says their piece Spock merely looks around and characteristically raises an eyebrow. Kirk meanwhile returns to his cabin to ""sleep it off"" and voices his final log entry for the day: ""Note to Galley: Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions"" (lol).

BEST HISTORICAL QUOTE: As General Chang prosecutes Kirk at the trial he screams out ""DON'T WAIT FOR THE TRANSLATION -- ANSWER ME NOW!!"" The writers ingeniously slipped this famous line in; it's a quote from U.N. Representative Adlai Stevenson during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 wherein he drilled Soviet Ambassador Zorin.

BEST HOMAGE: It was twelve years before that Shatner uttered his ridiculously criticized ""Oh my God"" line in ""The Motion Picture."" Well, guess how he reacts when he meets an intimidating 7-foot pig-skinned alien in the mines? You guessed it.

I could go on with the highlights; this is just a taste of the many great scenes/bits.

FINAL ANALYSIS: This is the last film in which the entire original cast appear together, and it's a more-than-solid outing verging on greatness; a good chronicling of the events leading up to the Klingon-Federation alliance portrayed in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Although the film lacks the profundities of ""The Motion Picture,"" ""The Final Frontier"" and ""Generations,"" it's a more than satisfying romp -- very involving and fun, highlighted by a nice whodunit scenario. What more could a Trek fan ask for? Needless to say, a fine way to end The Original Series.

464528,5,630242335X,"Now all six of the original cast Star Trek films are available in DVD special editions, and each one is well worth the price because of the restored sound/video, the fantastic extras, the candid commentaries, and the learned text commentary on each disc by ST historian family, the Okudas.  It's almost like the film itself is secondary to all these neat extras!  Fortunately for Trek fans, this final voyage of the original crew is also one of the best (for my money, only Wrath of Khan is better).  Nick Meyer retakes the directorial reigns, and uses them to craft an engaging and exciting story, interwoven with strong parallels to the real political climate of the time.

The story: an environmental disaster occurs in the Cronos system (containing the Klingon homeworld).  The leader of the Klingons realises he must sue for a peace treaty with the Federation or the Klingon Empire will collapse under its military budget.  On his way to Earth for negotiations, under escort by our heroes in the Enterprise-A, he is assasinated.  Kirk and McCoy are held responsible, tried and convicted, and shipped off to the Klingon Gulag.  They must attempt to escape while Spock and the rest of the crew try to find the real assasins.

Because Meyer is not a Star Trek person, per se, he tried to craft the best movie he could, regardless of ""Star Trek sensibilities"".  He succeeds admirably in making a great film with engaging dialogue.  Because the film works so well, and because the characters are cut a little more sharply (Kirk says of Klingons ""Let them die!""), the melodrama is heightened and the payoff is more poignant.  Older fans (like myself) will easily recognise the parallels with the Cold War Communist/NATO conflict (in fact, the Klingon General Chang gets to use Adlai Stevenson's famous Cuban Missile Crisis line: ""Don't wait for the translation, answer me now!"")  Other notable Star Trek-isms include frequent quotations from Shakespeare and Chekov's claim that Cinderella is a ""Russian epic"".

Basically, the film just works.  There are many small joys in the details of the characters, and my favourite segment in ALL of the Star Trek films is the opening of the assassination sequence: it gives me chills every time I watch it.  Finally, with such a collection of Canadian actors (Christopher Plummer and Kim Catrall join regulars Shatner and Doohan), how could a Canuck like me not like this film?!",1091836800,4,2417,4.930864197530864
464529,5,630242335X,"This is personally my favorite Star Trek film; it possesses an original story based on [at the time] current events, and for a trek film it is both intriguing and a bit spooky.  The film follows the (now functioning, post ST: V) Enterprise-A as they are sent to escort the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon to Earth, under the command of reluctant James T. Kirk, who detests the Klingon race for the cold murder of his son (as seen in ST: III).  En route to Earth, an incident occurs in which the Chancellor's ship is seemingly attacked by the Enterprise and the Chancellor is assassinated by disguised Starfleet crewmen.  Kirk and Dr. McCoy attempt to aid the dying Klingons, but they are arrested as assassins by Gorkon's chief-of-staff, General Chang.

Kirk and McCoy are sentenced to the prison planet of Rura Penthe where they have several assassination attempts pitted against them.  Spock, meanwhile determines that several Federation, Romulan, and even Klingon members conspired together to murder the chancellor so that there would be no peace in the galaxy and each government could profit off war.  Kirk even realizes that he had held a grudge against peace due to the murder of his son.  The movie shows a great deal of conflict that has a great feeling of political pressure, analogous to the Cold War tensions.

The Ups: The space battles are awesome; it's nice to see Sulu as captain of the Excelsior, considering he fell in love with that ship in ST: III; Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Chang is great; and the ""crew's"" acting, including Shatner's Kirk are all wonderful; Nick Meyer's direction is of course magnificent, as he had previously demonstrated his ability with ST: II; and Cliff Eidelman's score is incredible and it's eerieness completely compliments the mood of the film itself.

The Downs: The Enterprise-A gets decommissioned, though it was just commissioned at the epilogue of ST: IV; I feel that there should have been more of a presence of the Romulans in the picture, and Chang's quoting of Shakespeare, at times, comes across as too much of a carbon copy of Khan quoting Melville in ST: II.",1091836800,3,2122,4.888579387186629

In this final motion picture installment of the franchise, director Nicholas Meyer (director of Wrath of Kahn) brings us a dramatic adventure filled with mystery, suspense, and a lot of action.

Parallelling the political mood of 1992 when the US was rapproaching with Russia and Yeltsin, the story starts with the Klingons being on the verge of economic and political capitulation: the film plot is actually similar to the spy thriller 'The Package' starring Gene Hackman. Kirk and his crew have been selected for a diplomatic mission in which they must settle a future peace with the Klingon empire but not every human or Klingon wants peace.  When the Klingon diplomat Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) falls victim to a plot, accusations fly on both sides and Kirk is literally trapped in the middle.  Kirk and his crew must soon work against the machinations of the war-hungry Klingon General Chang (Christopher Plummer) to save the peace.

 Star Trek VI proved not to be the last Trek film (or the last with Shatner), but it was the last with the complete original crew. As such, it is a fitting end to the legacy of Gene Roddenberry's original vision (he died during production).

 I am an unashamed Trekkie, so a recommendation from me is probably not that convincing. However, I can safely say that this is not only one of the best Trek films to date, but one of the best sci-fi action films with a brain. Despite the daunting ""VI"" in the title, even if you know nothing of Trek, this film has something for everybody.

 Now, some comments here have stated the print looks a little dirty. However, while there is some grain and a few artefacts here and there, I have to disagree. The film has an intentionally ""dirty"" look - both director Nicholas Meyer and production designers agreed on a much dirtier and more military/industrial look for this film, even with the more familiar sets on the Enterprise. For some, this may come as a stark contrast to other Trek films, and the pristine look of the ships in the newer TV series. Further, with supplements as good as this, that cover everything from modern philosophy to peacekeeping in a modern world, Paramount have given us one of the best Trek DVDs to date.

I was only eight when the film was released in '91, but when they special edition DVD's were released, I decided it would be best to buy just my favorites, and this one is on the list.
Why? Well, the script takes you for a good ride for close to two hours and never lets up - I mean never. There aren't many scripts that can do that. What impressed me the most is the acting. The actors aren't the same, campy, over-dramatic ones which they were claimed to be during the run of the television series. These are actors that pretty much know that this is the last movie in the franchise that made them stars, and they give down to earth and funny performances. It's almost like five grandparents and a grandma acting, with all that wisdom and wit. Shatner's performance was the greatest. This isn't the actor that released a horrible CD and is still impersonated - this is William Shatner at his best. Christopher Plummer is also incredible as the villain Chang. The trial scene is a great piece of acting for him.
True, the premise is based on the post-Cold War collapse of Russia, but isn't this how Trek was started after all? The Federation was NATO, the Klingons were Russians, and the Romulans Japanese? Roddenberry took our world, made races out of countries, and boom, we have ""Star Trek."" Many people who believe that ""Trek"" is unrealistic must do is look to our history to believe how wrong they are. Either way, this movie is a fitting sendoff that features the crew, and is what I believe right up there with the second movie as one of the best.",1085961600,3,1776,4.588050314465409
464567,3,630242335X,"My Rating: 3.5/5.0 stars.
After Star Trek V, which DID stink (sorry, Bill!), the powers that be did what everyone would hope they did: hire back Nick Meyer, who directed Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, to do a rescue.  And while this movie does not hit the high standard set by that film, it is a very respectable bit of sci-fi fun and ended the whole series on a positive note.
If Meyer can be faulted for anything, it is for trying to stuff too much, well, STUFF in one film.  This movie has political intrigue, an assassination plot, a murder mystery (!), some courtroom drama (!!), a prison break (!!!), a cat-and-mouse starship battle (shades of Khan?), then caps everything off with the wrap-up of the political intruge/multiple assassination plotline you almost forgot about with all the other stuff in-between.  As Meyer might have said, but as far as I know never did, ""Oy, vey!""
On the upside, almost everything is well done, so the end result is a fun Star Trek movie that, much like ""The Wrath of Khan,"" is also very accessible, even if it lacks the sheer visceral punch of that Star Trek high-water-mark.  Kudos, too, for the DVD extras, which have been consistently excellent in the latest run of Paramount 2-DVD Star Trek sets.",1082851200,2,1243,4.610859728506787

464570,5,630242335X,"Arguably the best of the six STAR TREK feature films sporting the entire original series cast, THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY is a well crafted tale of political intrigue that effectively bridges the gap between the original series and THE NEXT GENERATION.  In the capable hands of Nicholas Meyer, who also directed the second Trek feature THE WRATH OF KHAN, each of the cast members are given fuller, more important roles to play.  Not only that, but there is still plenty of room for other wonderful characterizations by such guest stars as Christopher Plummer, David Warner, and  Kim Cattrall!
Though some have expressed a desire to see the theatrical version of the film released on DVD, this edition contains the extended Director's Cut of the film.  There have been a  few very minor changes made to the film this time around though, making it the third version available to the public since its debut.  Three sequences have been altered, but  only one of them is actually noticeable to long time viewers of the film.  If you are uncertain as to what scenes have been altered, view the text commentary as it will explain what has been altered.  I think that the changes work quite well, being subtle enough not to make you suddenly realize that this is a different version of your favorite film!
As for the extras, Paramount has finally achieved the perfect balance of interesting material.  The useless space-filler documentaries of the past Trek special editions, several of which never seemed to pertain to the actual film in any way, are wisely avoided this time around.  Now we are presented with nicely detailed interviews and behind-the-scenes excerpts with director Meyer, writer Denny Martin Flynn,  as well as the rest of the cast and crew that really give some wonderful insight into the actual creation of the film, from the first idea to the final thoughts about the finished product.
The best documentary on this set is the one made in tribute to the late DeForest Kelley, who endearingly portrayed Dr. Leonard McCoy.  Many clips from Kelley's long acting career are shown, much of which pre-dated STAR TREK, and it is fascinating viewing.  The documentary takes you right up through the last appearance of  his infamous character in the franchise (this film is the last time the venerable actor played the role of McCoy), as well as the last few days of his life.  This, as well as the interview with him made during the end of filming for this movie back in 1991, are the absolute highlights of the DVD.  DeForest Kelley will always be fondly remembered by fans and critics alike!
Other documentaries abound, such as a nifty tour of the props department.  ""The Perils Of Peacemaking"" is a very interesting piece that details the history of the Chernobyl disaster and how it directly influenced the idea and theme for this film.  There are interviews with each of the original cast members, as well as Iman (who plays the changeling ""Martia""), where they answer questions and give their insights on the franchise.  There is even an interview with composer Cliff Eidelman, who created a very dark and haunting score for this particular entry in the series.  Also, storyboards highlight some alternate and deleted scenes of the film  that are not to be missed!
The commentaries are very good this time around.  The audio commentary is provided by both Meyer and  Denny Martin Flynn.  Meyer usually tends to pursue rabbit trails in his commentaries versus sticking with the actual film (a reason that I was not looking forward to this commentary), but coupled together with Flynn, they stay focused on the film and the creative process and development that went into it.  Overall, a surprisingly informative commentary that I really enjoyed.  The text commentary by Michael Okuda is what we have all come to expect, revealing lots of interesting facts and trivia about the cast, sets, and locations of the film.  Very well done as usual!
Surprisingly, the fact that this film was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Make-Up and one for Best Sound Effects Editing, is never once mentioned anywhere in the documentaries nor is it commented on during the audio or text commentaries.  Oh well, at least you can see and hear for yourself just exactly why it received these well deserved nominations on this disc.  The picture quality is superb and the  new Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround mix is simply awesome.  Quite simply, the film has never looked or sounded better!
As fantastic of a job as Paramount did with this special edition release, I am somewhat baffled by the sloppy packaging of the actual set.  Though Paramount plans to stop packaging their DVDs with paper inserts, one has to wonder why they didn't at least include one here for the last of the original cast films.  Small nitpick to be sure, but still it would have made the set of six films universally alike.  More disturbingly, however, is the lack of quality control when it comes to ensuring that your discs are printed correctly.  To place a picture from a completely different movie on Disc 2 is one thing, but to print the words over the picture upside down is just plain ridiculous!  Even the interactive motion menus (which I always look forward to seeing) were a let down this time around.  The one on Disc 2 seems to be incomplete, basically taking you on the exact same journey regardless of the selection made.  It is ashamed that such a wonderful DVD full of great special features was sloppily packaged in such a rush to get it out on store shelves!
Overall, this is the best Trek DVD to be released to date.  I recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the franchise.  Hopefully, the future releases will continue to either  maintain and/or  improve upon this level of quality, as well as avoiding any further un-needed packaging mistakes!",1078790400,11,5848,4.829317269076305

However, the intention was only to link events of the end of the original series to Star Trek: The Next Generation. The film is full of suspense and the cast at some of their best performances.

464573,1,630242335X,"And that's exactly what this movie, for I hesitate to honor it by calling it a film, is.
I grew up on Star Trek, racing home from school to ensure I got my homework done so I could watch the reruns uninterrupted.  I grasped the concepts and the allegories presented in each story and it made me think about another kind of world.  Perhaps a better one.
The Motion Pictures were slow at first; ST:TMP was ethereal and intellectual.  ST:TWOK was Shoot 'em up bang bang.  The series caught it's stride with ST:TSFP, combining emotionalism, intellect, and action in a mixture thoroughly enjoyable to both Trekkies and Non-Trekkies alike.
Then, as did the television series, it began to stumble and fall.  ST:TFF was reminiscent of a third season episode as Paramount was getting ready to close up shop on the series, and Gene Roddenberry was getting out while the getting was good.  An absurd story and poor special effects combined to make a film that was almost painful to watch.
The Undiscovered Country is a thinly disguised rehashing of the Cold War using the imminent collapse of the Klingon Empire due to an industrial accident on the Homeworld's moon as it's impetus.  Kirk, et al are given as a fig leaf as envoys to diplomatically solve the problem.
The assassination of the Klingon leader Gorkon, who is offering peace during this mission, and the ensuing Klingon Kangaroo Court places Kirk and McCoy on a Penal Colony asteroid, convicted of murder.
When it is finally established that Klingon Military, led by General Chang is at the heart of the conspiracy to prevent a peaceful solution between the Federation and the Klingons by assassinating first Gorkon, then in a failed attempt, the president of the Federation, there is an inevitable final battle between Kirk and Chang.  With just as inevitable results.
While the television series often did the same, specifically regarding Viet Nam and the Cold War of almost forty years ago, it did so with a great deal more tact, and much more creative writing.
The Undiscovered Country doesn't have those qualities.  It is preachy and strident.  The actors and actresses speak and behave far out of character, i.e., Spock's mind assault on his lieutenant, and their strongly hinted at affair, or Scotty's comment regarding ""that Klingon b***h"".
This is a movie that tries to use special effects to compensate for poor writing, worse gags for cheap laughs, and a total lack of regard for well established and well known characters.
No, this is not Star Trek at it's best, or even, in my opinion, Star Trek at all.  It is the final wringing of the now only damp towel of the franchise, to get those last few drops of cash from it before the original crew was too old to make any more movies.

The menus were VERY annoying -that and the lack of a booklet cost it a star.  How many times do we need to see that cart go down the shaft???
I did think the documentaries took a good chunk of time explaining the allegory to USSR / US, sometimes over-explaining the fact.
I did enjoy the Shatner out-take - I just wish this film had more out-takes and or scenes. The problem with a near perfect film is the desire not to ruin it by adding things in that were left out.
As for the upside down ship on disc II, there is def. quality control issues - after the pains they went thru for Star Trek II, and TMP with Robert Wise, you'd think there'd be consistancy, but then again look at the titles, package coloring, etc they've all varied too.
My only hope is that Generations is of the same calibre as TMP or TWOK in terms of extras - many fans have the 12 or so scenes excised from Generations, and it would be helpful to have a more definitive mastered version of this.

ST II: The Wrath of Khan is arguably the best Star Trek episode ever (on film or TV, old generation or next), and Meyers' second effort is even better in some ways.  Chris Eidelmann's score is also the equal of James Horner's, appropriate to this darker tale.

464631,4,630242335X,"The year was 1991,and alot of things were changing in the world around us. One of the most dramatic changes was the fact that the Cold War was finally coming to an end. Regan and Gorbachoff(excuse me if I mis-spelled his name) were finally negotiating for peace. The Iron Curtain was coming down...as well as the Berlin Wall and the steps towards peace were being taken.
  On a less serious note,Paramount Studios was trying to figure out how to overcome the disaster that was Star Trek V:The Final Frontier so that they could make some big bucks just in time for the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek. It didn't take a Vulcan to figure out that the best thing to do was to get the old war horses back for one last movie...and make it a good one.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY GOT!!!!
  They brought in Trek II director Nicholas Meyer and Leonard Nimoy(who wrote and directed III and IV) who came up with a brillant concept. Star Trek had always been at the forefront of present day social and political issues since the series first aired in 1966. Now Nimoy and Meyer decided to bring the peace between the U.S. and Russia into a sci-fi context. And,as usual,Star Trek hit it on the head.
  From the explosion of the Klingon Moon of Praxis(the Chernobyl incident),to the dismantling of the Neutral Zone outpost(the fall of the Berlin Wall)to the idea that only a hardline conservitive like Captain Kirk could bridge the gap between the Federation and the Klingons(Regan's repore with Gorbachoff,or as Spock put it ""Only Nixon could go to China."")the film effectively places current events into the sci-fi context. And in between there is intrigue,betrayal,murder,and redemption which almost turns the film into a political thriller.
  The fine performances,not just by the crew of the Enterprise,but those of Kim Catrall as an idealistic,but mis-guided Vulcan,and the wonderfully eccentric General Chang by Christopher Plummer,the great story by Meyer and Nimoy,and the hair-raising action of the dogfight with the cloaked Bird of Prey makes this a terrific final curtain to one of the most exciting ensamble casts in film(or TV) history.
  The Special Edition features audio commentary from Meyer as well as a documentary on the making of the film(which also discusses the U.S./Russian peace process) and a wonderful tribute to Deforest Kelley,aka Doctor ""Bones"" McCoy.
If you're wondering why I'm gushing so much over the film and only gave it four stars,there's a reason. I'm tired of William Shatner whinning and moaning about how Meyers didn't use his ideas(As he did in previous docs. from the other films)The prime example is on the scene where Kirk and Spock are in the council chamber when Kirk exclaims ""LET THEM DIE!"" Shatner wanted Kirk to make a face as if he regretted saying that. The documentary shows the deleted scene in which Shatner,of course,overacts the gesture. But for the rest of the documentary,he whines about it!

464633,5,630242335X,"Following the disastrous critical and box office reception of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Paramount could have easily dropped the original cast in favor of The Next Generation. However, sentiment prevailed and Nicholas Meyer, who directed The Wrath of Khan (still the most popular film with most Trekkers) and who co-wrote The Voyage Home (still the highest grossing Trek film), was called in. He, along with Leonard Nimoy, fashioned a script which features most of what has made Trek endure through the years: a relevant story drawing on then current events (i.e., the lightning paced changes in the relationship between the United States and the then Soviet Union, which precipitated the end of the Cold War), with plenty of action, drama, humor (appropriate humor, not slapstick) and character development. Thus, the original cast would be able to exit the franchise with their heads held high.
The pacing of this film is much smoother than the earlier films (even Treks II & IV took too long to get moving) starting swiftly and accelerating to the pulse-pounding conclusion. The overall tone of the film is darker and edgier than any previous Trek (perhaps the filmmakers were taking a cue from 1989s Batman, which obliterated Star Trek V at the box office). The directing is fluid, with Meyer's camera swooping around the bridge (a notoriously difficult set to film in) and the other sets, and the editing is tight. Although the story primarily (and correctly) focuses the action on the triumvirate of Kirk, Spock & McCoy, the supporting cast is given plenty to do as well. Sulu, in particular--finally Captain of his own ship--has greater involvement. Guest star Christopher Plummer molds General Chang into Trek's best villain since Khan, and David Warner makes a lends an air of dignity as Chancellor Gorkon (the name is an amalgamation of Gorbachev and Lincoln). There are a few additions from the theatrical version which have appeared on all video versions: The Colonel West plotline was not in the original film (perhaps Paramount thought the parallel to Colonel Oliver North was too obvious).  For this DVD, there are also few small alterations during the Spock/Valeris Mind Meld scene.
All of the charm of Classic Trek is here: a final needling exchange between Spock & McCoy; the occasional, almost improvised humor; characters being thrown every which way on the bridge during battle; Kirk kissing a beautiful female; one last bit of scenery chewing from Shatner, who holds his own against fellow hamosaurus Plummer; and, finally, a bittersweet ending.
The visual effects of The Undiscovered Country (a reference to Shakespeare) hold up well, with very little use of stock shots (three effects shots from this film would later be used in 1994s Star Trek Generations). The score by Cliff Eidelmann accentuates the activities on screen, without overshadowing them, and adds to the dark atmosphere of the film.
The transfer on this DVD is excellent, with the colors, especially the maroon uniform jackets, crisp & vibrant--an improvement over the previous DVD, and light years ahead of the VHS and LaserDisc editions. Since the film was shot in ""matted"" Super 35, rather than Panavision, the aspect ratio is not as wide as the other Trek films. The sound is detailed with plenty of punch.
The bonus features are the best of any Trek film so far, including featurettes on the evolution of the story, prejudice in the Trek universe, Shatner's ""reunion"" with Plummer (back in the 1950s, Shatner understudied for Plummer in Henry V), and a moving tribute to the late DeForest Kelley.",1076198400,16,3597,5.065767284991568

464665,4,630242335X,"A worthy dvd to the collection.  I only have one other dvd of a Star Trek movie and that is the collectors edition of ""Wrath of Khan"".  Six is my personal favorite as I think it is the most exciting and allegorical of the movies.  It is a commentary on the post cold war mentality in the ladder-half of the twentieth century and the fall of the Soviet Union put into a Star Trek setting of human federation members dealing with their classic Klingon enemies in a more realistic vision than black or white.  This film is an espionage thriller set in futuristic outer space and has the same intensity as ""Hunt for Red October"".
After a horrid turn it made with the poorly concieved, unreflective, supposed finale, ""...V: The Final Frontier"",
Nicholas Meyer, a mild fan of the series, who had directed what is still the most beloved of the series, ""The Wrath of Khan"", was asked to direct the original Trek crews legacy out of this tight spot.  Meyer, I would credit, as an outsider of the hard-core fanhood, who with objectivity, thematically enhanced the series by pushing the allegory of life at sea with being abord the ship.  He is a terrific writer and he had a lot of literary knowlege to insert and he does it professionally for how he studies up on the star trek universe and reads into aspects of it that were not given a lot of thought.
Aside from this films amazing amount of profound satire, homage, and allegory, it stands as a brilliant and consistant concluder by it bothering to remember the hisory of the movie series and shows that actions in previous films have concequences in the end.  This would be even more true if they not chosen not to replace a familiar character, who was intended to make a very dramatic turn, with a new character whose bold decision has less impact given that you just met this character.
The ""Next Generation"" series of movies have about as much connection with eachother at the James Bond movies do when watched back to back.  If you want to watch the ""Original Crew"" movie series in a way that feels like a saga of connected story line like ""The Lord of the Rings"" series does, the perfect Trek movie line up is, II, III, IV, and VI.
And by the way, I didn't buy the previous edition of this DVD like many people because it looked like it was struck off the same master as my VHS copy was.  Now the movie is very well mastered with much better light and color.  The widescreen presentation has finally been centered and the subtitles(translating Klingon) within the picture.  For all you nittpicky widescreen purists (me included) who were curious why all widescreen versions of this movie aren't as wide as the scope ratio 2.35:1, I have read from multiple sources online that this movie like all the other Trek films was presented on the big screen in scope, but unlike the others, it was filmed and executed in the, then experimental, non-anamorphic, super35 format which is 16:9 and was matted out at the top and bottom when in theaters. While inconsistent with the format of the entire movie series, this is the maximum image composition director-approved presentation.  I believe all three of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies were made this way too only they have spawned scope widescreen editions and fullscreen editions that are both as incomplete as eachother in opposite ways.  It's frustrating, but this is how they are shooting the majority of scope-shaped movies today. They want them to be versitile, which accounts for the lack of dynamic screen composition.  Anyway that was a bit unrelated, but I just thought it would be worth clearing that issue up.
The extras are good too. Good commentary.

The original cast is all awesome in this film. You see plent of the big three in Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly all had such great chemistry with each other and looked real close. The tribute to Kelly on this DVD is nice. All three have great performances as does the rest of the crew. It's sad to see a good thing like that end. It was such a humble start to a show that is now a multi billion dollar franchise. I don't think any of those guys thought when they started this show in the 60's that 10 movies and four spin offs would have come from it.
Star Trek VI is a great film. You don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to like it, you just won't appreciate it as much. You can't be a trekkie and not have this film.",1075420800,,1452,4.098245614035088
464669,4,630242335X,"It took me a while to like ""Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country"".  It is noticeably different in feel from its predecessors (darker, more revisionist), and this put me off a bit- I used to lump it in with the bad ""Star Trek"" films, such as ""The Final Frontier"" and ""Generations"".  However, the movie has grown on me the last couple years, and I now see it as a quality entry in the series.
I wouldn't say there's anything outstanding about ""The Undiscovered Country"", but instead it's a steadily entertaining adventure.  The visuals are markedly improved over the previous Trek films, especially ""The Final Frontier"".  However, ""The Undiscovered Country""'s real strength is in its story and acting.  The movie shows two competing empires' attempt to reconcile their differences and end the insane arms race that they're engaged in.  Its main theme- peace is the only way- may seem hokey to some, but I found it to be a very good one.  There's a lot of symbolism going on in this film, and the Special Edition interviews help you to see just how large of goals the filmakers had.
The Trek regulars give among their best performances here.  William Shatner- thankfully removed from the director's chair- gives a subtle and effective performance, easily his best one since ""The Search for Spock"".  The other Trek regulars, aware that this was their final film, give their performances all that they've got, especially Leonard Nimoy and James Doohan.  I think it's nice that director Nicholas Meyer decided to give them all their time in the spotlight for this film.  The non-Trek regulars are effective as well, but they fade behind Christopher Plummer- his General Chang is gleefully over the top, and one of the best Trek villains ever.  Even though he's not given a lot of screen time, he manages to make a lasting impression.
If I have one complaint, it's with the movie's ending.  After director Meyer finishes the film's great space battle, he seems eager to wrap things up, and the entire ""second assassination"" scene feels like an afterthought.  Also, too much time was spent on the ""whodunit"" aspect of the film- it's not too hard to pinpoint the conspirators early on (come on, did anyone really think Chang was a goodguy?)
Overall though, ""The Undiscovered Country"" is a very enjoyable movie, and a worthy entry into the Trek franchise.  It seems even better when compared with its immediate predecessor, ""The Final Frontier"".  If you don't like it on the first viewing, give it some time and it will surely grow on you.",1075334400,,2528,4.844186046511628
464670,4,630242335X,"""Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country""
Review by Wayne A. Klein

Boldly going where no cast has gone before--retirement, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise endure one more mission under the direction of Nicholas Meyer (""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn"", ""Time After Time"" and author of  ""The Seven Percent Solution"") Despite some story gaps and flaws in logic, the momentum and action keep ""Country"" entertaining something that couldn't be said for the badly flawed ""Star Trek V"". Although clearly well beyond his days of gallivanting about the galaxy, James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is pushed into escorting his enemies to a meeting to discuss peace between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets. Kirk still bears scars and anger over the murder of his son by a Klingon commander (in ""Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock"").  With witty allusions of Sherlock Holmes, and current history, Country has enough action and humor to satisfy both the devoted Trekkie and the average viewer.

It seems that a massive explosion on the moon Praxis has forced the Klingon Empire to seek outside aid from the Federation as the debris of the moon destroying their planet. Led by the Lincolnesque Chancellor Gorkon (the droll and sincere David Warner in a marvelous supporting role), the Klingons are as suspicious of Kirk as he is of them. When the Enterprise inexplicably fires on the ship Kronos 1 and a murder is committed by Enterprise crew members, General Chang (a larger than life Christopher Plummer) arrests Kirk and Dr. McCoy when they beam over to the ship to provide assistance. Returning to the Klingon home world, Kirk and McCoy are put on trial and convicted of assassinating a leading Klingon political leader and sentenced to spend their lives on a distant ice gulag.

Meyer's taunt direction and witty script (written with Denny Martin Flinn)helped breath new life into the final entry featuring the original cast. Meyer is to be commended for his direction of the actors as well. William Shatner can easily blow through a scene like a tornado consuming all the audience's attention when he overplays his role. As in ""Khan"" Meyer brings out the best in Shatner without letting him chew the scenery too much. Shatner's staccato line readings are also kept in check. He gives one of his best performances as Kirk in the Trek franchise.  Nimoy Nimoy and Kelley are, as always, a delight to watch interact.  Doohan Doohan, Koenig, Takei and Nichols are all given their moments as well. Each plays the comic elements of their particular scenes really well. Something that's often missed about the original cast is their skill as comic players. Humor was a regular feature of many episodes but there were also a number of tongue-in-cheek episodes where the actors displayed their versatility at drama and comedy. The material provided by Meyer and Flinn (with an original story dreamed up by Leonard Nimoy) provides just the right mix of drama, comedy and pathos for the original cast to play.

Finally released in its correct widescreen anamorphic aspect ratio (the previous release was widescreen only), ""Country"" looks marvelous with rich blacks and a minimum of compression artifacts. As a result, the image looks sharper and richer particularly in scenes involving optical effects. There are virtually no analog artifacts in the form of hair, splotches, etc. on the print used for the transfer. The colors are rich and vibrant looking.  While the color seemed a bit richer on the previous release, clearly this ""Country"" features the look that Meyer wanted for his finished film. After the lackluster earlier release from Paramount of the same film, ""Country"" wafts in like a cool breeze on a nasty, humid day.

While the sound isn't up to par compared to a 2004 theatrical release, the expansive Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround mix has a much more expansive feel than the previous edition of the DVD. The unusual orchestral score by Cliff Eidelman finally gets its due; the opening fanfare captures all the raw excitement evident in the film itself. Eidelman's score compares favorably to Jerry Goldsmith's score for Star Trek: The Motion Picture and sounds just as great here as Goldsmith's did on that remastered DVD from a couple of years ago.

Some of the dialog sounds a bit ""flat"" without much depth but usually this is most noticeable in scenes where there is little else going on in the way of sound effects and music score. Otherwise, the remastered sound marvelously captures the best elements of the theatrical release. The rich sound effects and background ambiance hasn't sounded this good since the film's original theatrical release in 1990. There are some minor flaws with the sound due to the use of compression to fatten up the sound of the film but, again, that's a very minor issue.

Paramount decided to spring for most of the extras with Country. While there are no deleted scenes or any gag reels, out takes, etc. the film comes packed with a number of attractive feaurettes and trailers. Since Meyer's Director's Cut was released on laserdisc, home video and DVD previously, there aren't any new extended scenes in the film. It does appear, though, that Meyer may have done some more trimming here and there to enhance the film. We have an engaging audio commentary on disc one by director Meyer and co-screenwriter Denny Martin Flinn. Meyer tends to occasionally go off on some wild tangents but, on the whole, stays focuses on the day-to-day difficulty of producing the film. He and Flinn also discuss scenes that were cut from the original script prior to production due to cost

Almost all the extras are located exclusively on the second disc. There's six feaurturettes on the making of the film entitled ""Movie Making"". All six can be played together or separately. There's also a section on The Star Trek Universe which focuses on the background of Gene Roddenberry's original creation and Meyer's take on the same raw material. Meyer has made no secret that he saw Star Trek as Horatio Hornblower in outer space and that's relayed clearly in this feature as well as the first film of the franchise he directed (""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn""). Universe consists of a number of notable feaurettes including ""Klingons: Conjuring a Legend"".

The section about the inspiration of the film is particularly compelling. ""Art Imitates Life: The Perils of Peacemaking it focuses on the real life inspiration for The Undiscovered Country including the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The most touching piece, though, is the tribute to an under rated actor. DeForest Kelley made his debut in Fear in the Night from 1947. This short tribute focuses on the film and television roles he inhabited outside of Star Trek. Featuring interviews with colleagues and producers from the beginning and latter part of his career, ""Deforest Kelley: A Tribute"" captures all the warmth and magic of this consummate character actor who finally found his niche as Dr. McCoy.

The original cast and crew interviews as well as the trailers are included. Additionally, there's an excerpt from a 1991 convention presentation by director Meyer. Finally, we have an Archives section consisting of production photos, storyboards and assorted odds and ends that didn't quite fit into other parts of the disc.  I personally found the extras here more rewarding than on any other Trek film release with the possible exception of  Robert Wise's Director's Edition of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". While ""Country"" doesn't differ as significantly as ""ST:TMP"", the minor tweaking that Meyer did for the previously issued laserdisc version helped clarify plot points and improve the overall pacing of the film. My only complaint is that, unlike the recent re-release of ""Alien"", ""Country"" doesn't offer the original theatrical version in an extended branching edition so fans can compare both head to head.

.
Although Shatner, Koenig and Doohan appeared in one more Trek film (""Star Trek: Generations"" which featured The Next Generation cast and which will be issued in March in a Special Director's Edition as well), ""Country"" clearly was intended as the final voyage of the original crew.  It's a marvelous sent off for the original cast of the original series, ""Star Trek:The Undiscovered Country"" finally appears the way director Meyer intended it to. Additionally, the second disc of extras make this an essential DVD for Trek fans.",1075334400,,8475,5.002129169623847

464672,5,630242335X,"Let me explain
-Spoiler Warning-
The first version of the film was shown in theaters.
The second version was shown on all home video formats. This version includes a couple of additional footage to certain key scenes, and a few new scenes all together.
- Spock has more Dialogue in the top brass meeting.
- A scene taking place in the President's office where Col. West presents his plan to sneak into Klingon territory and rescue Kirk and McCoy.
- Spock and Scotty checking the torpedo inventory before Valeris informs them that the Chancellor's Daughter is now the current klingon chancellor.
- The klingon assassin at the climax of the film turns out to be Col. West.
The Third version of the film is shown on this Special Collector's Edition DVD. This version includes all the material from the second version, and a few minor changes to certain scenes and effects.
- When Martia gets shot, a disruption sound effect is removed to make her scream more apparent.
- Valeris's interrogation scene has been entirely reedited. There are now close up shots of Kirk and McCoy when they speak their lines instead of being in wide shots. When Spock and Valeris name a particular conspirator, the face of that person briefly appears in a flashback like style.
Do I prefer this version of the film? Sure. I personally believe that Valeris's interrogation scene is much more dramatic with the flashback shots. It really helps the viewers who aren't good with names understand who Spock and Valeris are talking about, and adds a little more tension near the end of the film.
I hoped this information helps you out in spotting what has been changed. If there is anything I missed, please feel free to contact me.",1075248000,169,1702,4.753378378378378

464734,3,630242335X,"Well, the movie is still great, but this DVD edition leaves much to be desired. For some unfathomable reason, this print is inferior to the one used for the original DVD release. The picture is somewhat darker, the colors are more intense, and the overall sharpness is softer.
 It's definitely a different print, because the english translations of the ""klingon"" dialogue appear within the picture frame rather than below it as it did on the original DVD release. It may have been done so that Nick Meyer could make his relatively insignificant alterations, but to me this begs the question of why the big drop in picture quality? Several other movies have been altered by the directors ( James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" and ""Aliens"", for example ) without suffering the ignominity of looking worse than they did before. In this age of digital magic, surely something could have been done to improve the look of this print.
As if that isn't odd enough, the image on the face of disc two is actually from the movie ""Star Trek: Generations"" and is printed upside-down. Hello...quality control, are you awake?
Still, it's nice to have the extras, and the director's changes to the film are definitely improvements ( if not Earth-shattering ). But I was hoping for a bit more. Frankly I felt that the extras for ""Star Trek V"" were more impressive, and I was hoping that since this was the last movie featuring the original cast, that a bit more depth to the extras, and more care with the final product would have been taken.",1075075200,9,1517,4.724528301886792
464735,5,630242335X,"Star Trek VI is my third-favorite of all the films, right behind The Wrath of Khan and First Contact. This movie once again examined current events through the scope of Gene Roddenberry's universe; it contained great space opera, plenty of intrigue, a decidedly melodramatic villain, and some genuine thrills. This is Star Trek at its best: bold, relevant and decidedly optimistic.
The plot for this installment closely parallels the political climate of the early 90s. The hostility between the Klingon Empire and the Federation is over due to a disaster on a key Klingon moon. The Federation and Klingons decide to try to settle their differences diplomatically, and Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is selected to escort the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (the wonderful David Warner) and his staff, including the prickly General Chang (a similarly excellent Christopher Plummer). All hell breaks loose after an attack on the Klingon Flagship leaves Gowron dead and Kirk and McCoy (DeForrest Kelley) charged with the crime. They must escape from prison and piece together who was behind the attack, as well as prevent the killer from striking again. The leads are wonderful here, including all the original series crew, a pre-Sex and the City Kim Catrall, and especially Warner and Plummer, who both bring their Shakespeare roots to make this perhaps the most literate Trek movie.
The conflicts here are palpable and help to make the movie so interesting. Spock with his Vulcan protege who turns out to be a turncoat, Kirk has to grapple with his racism toward Klingons which mirrors the conflict between the two empires. Director Meyer once again proves his ability to create ascending tension in his work. The final scene with Kirk's speech is a powerful one. This is, in many ways, the most epic Trek film.
This DVD ought to be worth it for the Trek fan. I'm sure Nicholas Meyer will do the commentary for this movie, which should be great. Meyer's commentary for The Wrath of Khan was inspired, full of interesting trivia, and Meyer himself came off as intelligent and creative. I'm sure looking forward to it.",1073692800,4,2110,5.014245014245014
464736,5,630242335X,"2 4 6, why does the even numbered Treks work (though I still like Trek III, despite being studio bound and featuring a silly bad guy)? Trek has always been about the characters, the interaction of all the actors. And when the writers and directors relied on that -instead of big, empty action pieces and visual eefects -the movie series soared. Looking back over six films, to see why Trek has remained popular after nearly 38 years, is because Trek's II, IV and VI knew this was what the fans wanted. Current Trek (like the last two Next Generation films and Voyager and Enterprise) have chucked most of these ideals out the space dock for digital effects. Undiscovered Country is a well made film, with relaxed performances from the entire cast. Director Nicholas Meyer has said that Shatner gave his best performance in Trek II because he never settled for phoned in performance. Shatner chews the scenery here, but it still good (and besides, Christopher Plumber really steals the whole film by chewing up every scene he's in). While not as good as Trek II or IV, it still is way better than V and the theatercial edition of The Motion Picture (the DVD version is a tad better). A fine send off. I just wished TNG could've substained the franchise, but only First Contact retained the ""family"" aspect that made the original series such a blast to watch",1073347200,3,1356,4.677824267782427
464737,3,630242335X,"I agree with most of the reviews that this film was better than V, but to say it is the best STAR TREK film made may be a bit of a stretch.  I will offer two criticisms, a minor and what I consider a major one, then I will pillor this film no further.  First, a good deal of the mystery in the plot seems dependent on these gravity boots.  Spock says they could not simply be flushed out the airlock for all to see.  Okay, maybe.  I'll accept that.  But then someone points out they could have been disintegrated by a phaser, at which point the Vulcan character picks up a phaser and fires it to demonstrate that no unauthorized phasers may be fired on board a starship.  Unauthorized phaser?  Huh?  Since when?  You have to get permission to fire a phaser?  An alarm goes off if you do?  This is a ridiculous idea when you think about it, and points to a symptom of the larger disease of this film, which you can't really see unless you start looking, and then once you do the plot cracks apart like a house of cards.  Simply put, it is contrived.  The entire who-done-it plot does not hold up when examined in the cold light of day.  Sure, there is a lot to like about the film, but things like this phaser business make it hard for me to watch.  Not to mention this ""new"" Vulcan character that was obviously written for Savvik.  How great this would have been if it had been the Savvik character that betrayed Spock.  But I simply didn't have any emotional investment in this new character, although the writing, and Spock's reaction to her betrayal, clearly seem to suggest that this should have been Savvik.  The assassination attempt at the end is silly, at least the way it is edited.  I don't mean to bash the film--it is a decent movie, but I have never understood why fans love it so much and call it great when it has serious credibility and structural problems and can hardly be compared with ST II.",1073347200,4,1911,4.314606741573034
464738,5,630242335X,"In 1991 under the brilliant direction of Nicholas Meyer, the last of the ""Star Trek"" films was produced that featured the entire cast from the original ""Star Trek"" television series, which was originally broadcast between 1966 and 1969 and was the creation of the beloved writer Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991).  This sixth film in the series, entitled ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"", is, in my opinion, one of the best ""Star Trek"" films ever produced in large part because of Nicholas Meyer, who had previously directed what is often regarded to be finest ""Star Trek"" film ever made, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn"".  Also, this film benefited from the writing of Leonard Nimoy (who also portrays Captain Spock), Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal.  The title of the film and some of the film's dialog was quoted directly from William Shakespeare's (1564-1616) immortal play ""Hamlet"".
This sixth film begins with a horrific explosion on the Klingon moon known as Praxis that resulted from an industrial accident.  Praxis is very nearly destroyed, and the shockwave is felt for many light-years, including by the Federation Starship Excelsior, which is under the command of the promoted Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), who for many years languished as the navigator onboard the Starship Enterprise.  With their home world in jeopardy, the chancellor of the Klingon Empire, Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner), makes the unprecedented decision to establish a peace treaty between the Klingon Empire and the Federation.  Many Federation officers are, of course, highly skeptical of the Klingon's motives, including Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who blames the Klingons for the death of his son (which occurred in the film ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"").  So, when Captain Spock ""volunteers"" Captain Kirk to escort the Chancellor Gorkon's ship to Earth, Captain Kirk is more than a little miffed.  However, unforeseen events unfold that allow Captain Kirk and Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley, 1920-1999) to be accused of committing a horrific act that threatens the establishment of the peace treaty.
Memorable scenes in the film include the explosion on Praxis, the effects to the Excelsior, the Federation meeting, the Enterprise meeting Chancellor Gorkon's ship, the dinner and the events that immediately follow, the trial, the search onboard the Enterprise, Cmdr. Nyota Uhuru (Nichelle Nichols) trying to speak Klingon, the events on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, discussions between Spock and Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall), the battle with General Chang (Christopher Plummer) and the closing scenes.  Other memorable characters include Cmdr. Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), Capt. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), Cmdr. Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney), Adm. Cartwright (Brock Peters), the Federation president (Kurtwood Smith), Azetbur (Rosanna DeSoto), Klingon defense attorney Col. Worf (Michael Dorn, of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation fame), Klingon judge (Robert Easton), Klingon commander of Rura Penthe (William Morgan Sheppard) and Martia (Iman).
Being the final film featuring the original ""Star Trek"" cast, the closing credits are unique by featuring their signatures. ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" was, without doubt, a very fitting tribute and final farewell to the original cast.  Overall, I rate the film with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Many thanks go to Nicholas Meyer for directing such an excellent ""Star Trek"" film, and many thanks go to ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry for creating such an enduring legacy of stories that will continue to influence science fiction writing for many years to come.",1073001600,4,3714,5.419410745233969

Just as times were changing in the late 80s with the advent of TNG as well as worldly events as the fall of the Soviet Union and teh Berlin Wall, Trek seized the ideals and crafted a well written and acted film. The Klingon homeworld is in danger and the entire race is on the brink of becoming extinct. It is up to the Federation and Capt Kirk to work out a peaceful way for them to relocate and draw up an alliance that will have lasting effects. Enter new characters such as the vengeful Chang, Vulcan nymphette Valaris (played marvelously by future Sex & The City star Kim Catrall) and Iman as a shapeshifter and Kirk is in for the ride of his life.

This is the kind of classic Trek thats fans yearned for, and Meyer uses the same formula he had with Star Trek II mixing intelligent storytelling with a Shakespearian space opera, all of which makes this installment light years beyond the dismal Final Frontier.  Excellent casting elevates the film as well, including a scene chewing Christopher Plummer as the Klingon Chang, David Warner as Chancelor Gorkon, a pre-Sex in the City Kim Catrall, and a cameo by Christian Slater as an officer on the USS Excelsior.

Before the usual change of fortunes that brings Kirk to the top, he is apprehended and put on trial by the Klingons, during the course of which a very interesting observation is made about Kirk that we will return to shortly. The cast quoting some memorable lines from Shakespeare and more recent poets enhances the storyline. Also entertaining is the usual Star Trek wit and humor.
As a die-hard fan of the original TV series that watched Star Trek movies 1 thru 6, I felt it proper to include a tribute to the Star Trek movies. The TV series was one of my most favorite shows and I have watched every episode several times. When it was announced that Star Trek motion pictures would be produced, I awaited the release with much anticipation. Now that I have seen every movie as well, I feel that without examining the relationship between the TV series and the movies, I cannot adequately write a tribute.
Star Trek movies marked a notable departure from the series, which from this point on I will refer to as Star Trek. In Star Trek, Kirk and Spock were portrayed as dedicated, disciplined, principled and intelligent officers who were worthy examples to follow. In addition, Spock became an icon by personifying a being, who unhindered by emotion, could surpass humans in physical and mental feats. As a Vulcan, he was incapable of lying. Their mission, also that of the Enterprise, the rest of her crew and the Star Fleet was to ""seek out new life and new civilizations"" and successfully interact with them. This interaction was not always a success, as in the case of the Romulans and Klingons. However, at the end they came out on top because of their discipline.
During the course of Star Trek movies, Kirk is transformed into ""an undisciplined officer who ignores the chain of command whenever it suits him"" as described during his Klingon trial mentioned earlier. Some examples include Star Trek II, (failing to raise shields in time resulting in devastating damage to the Enterprise by Khan), Star Trek III (commandeering a Star Fleet vessel and traveling to a planet against orders) and Star Trek VI (hurtling the Enterprise out of the space dock at speeds exceeding those set forth by regulations.)
Spock's transformation is more profound. The Vulcan who ""cannot lie"" begins lying in Star Trek II, (estimated repair time) which he calls ""exaggeration."" This trend continues until in Star Trek VI, every misrepresentation of facts is seen not as lie but ""omission"", ""difficulty"" and ""choice."" Following Spock's example, his Vulcan protg also lies freely.
Changes in Kirk and Spock affect the crew as well, transforming them from loyal and disciplined shipmates into space pirates, as they abandon the very principles that had made them a great crew.

Star Trek 6 is a cleverly written Sci-Fi murder mystery with a very powerful and tension filled climax.  ST6 has a great theme song and amazing special effects.

The movie really does go where no man has gone before.  Nicolas Meyer did an excellent job directing the movie.  Not only does the movie have some excellent quotes, but the dinner with the Klingons shows the distrust between StarFleet and the Klingons.  Not only that, but the whole movie has an excellent idea.

464809,3,630242335X,"Star Trek VI is a movie that seemed good when I saw it in the theatre, but which has shown its flaws with subsequent viewings.  This movie had the benefit of following Star Trek V, an absulutely horrendous movie in every possible way, and it seems great by comparison.  But on its own and especially by comaparison to earlier Trek films, it comes up short.  The charm of the old series is gone.  The same characters are there, but the humor, drama are forced.
The story is frequently interrupted for irrelevant and unfunny comic relief.  Star Treks II-IV all had many touches of humor especial IV, and VI tries desperately to recapture that, but the easy going humor that came from banter between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy has been replaced with staged gags which are frequently embarrassing to watch.
The story itself is implausible on the surface, in the middle, and on the bottom.  And itstead of real drama and supsense the movie settles for a dry somber score which seems out of place in a Trek film.
However, the movie is not without is merits, particulary to fans of Star Trek.  Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are still likeable characters, and the actors give these characters the same charm they always do.  And even if the story is poorly executed, the basic story idea is ultimately sound.  And the film does try to say something worthwhile.
Ultimately, I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but it isn't terrible, and it's probablly worth seeing if you like Star Trek.  Even though it deals with the original crew, it will probably appeal more to fans of the newer series that to those of the original series.",987120000,2,1612,4.644366197183099

Ok, these few Klingons and federation people that  hate to see this peace between the 2 races, decide to ""team up""  to keep hating each other.  I may have overlooked this and may be wrong,  but after watching this movie probably 20 times, I still can't find another  answer to this.  Ok, now for the rest of the movie - fabulous.  Gorkon and  Chang are excellent.  I love Chang's use of Shakespeare throughout the  film.  I just wish we could have seen more of the person that Gorkon was  before he was killed.  We only got to meet the chancellor for about 10  minutes then that's it, but he seemed as a good man.  Klingon ship firing  when cloaked, gotta love that.  Excelsior with Captain Sulu, gotta love  that.  It's good to see him in command, I thought it would seem wierd cause  we are so use to him being at the helm, but he seems to fit in nicely.  The  final battle scene is terriffic, special effect after special effect.  Of  course when the Klingon ship becomes visible, there's not much of a battle  anymore.  I don't know what else to say.

464875,2,630242335X,"Spoilers within, beware.
Here's a few of the things that bug me about ST6 now that I'm a bitter old man:
Sulu's ship just happening to be hit  by an energy wave that apparently traveled faster than light.  Computers/scanners that can't tell whether two photon torpedos were fired  from someplace *outside* the Enterprise, but can detect a little piece of  Velcro from a hundred light-years away. Communications officers so stupid  they have to look through books--and old books at that--to translate  Klingon. (I thought ""we'd never been this close..."" so who went  to the Klingon Public Library? And weren't they close enough to beam  Tribbles aboard a Klingon cruiser in TOS? ) Line after endless, aggravating  line of unnecessary, distracting literary references--at the expense of  real dialogue. The thrilling ""searching through closets and dresser  drawers"" scene. Valeris just happening to frame the only Enterprise crew  member with size 19 feet. Assassins so stupid they hide bloodstained  uniforms in a ventilation duct in the Officer's Lounge. Conspirators so  stupid they hide assassins' bodies in main turbolifts. The shapeshifter  inexplicably shifting into Kirk's form...and then not shifting back--why?  So we could have a nifty shot of Kirk disintegrating for the movie  trailers. Oh, and it was EXCELSIOR that was scouting out the ""gaseous  planetary anomolies,"" not Enterprise. This is not nitpicking. These  are major plot points--and I hate to say it, but they're really quite  stupid. Last but not least: UHURA. Not UHURU. Sorry if I sound a little  cynical and jaded, but the best part of this movie was the smarmy  manipulative pap--and that was smarmy and manipulative! I love classic  Trek.

464876,5,630242335X,"The last  grand adventure of the original crew of the 1701-A,  Undiscovered Country is an exciting and fitting end to  25 years of exploring  our hopes and dreams for the future.  Produced in 1991, two  years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the same year democracy  triumphed in the former Soviet Union, the fictional collapse of the Klingon  Empire and its intentional parallel to real life events is classic Star  Trek.
The story line, direction, special effects, fabulous music and  truly bravura acting performances (especially Christopher Plummer as a  Klingon Cold Warrior) make for what many consider to be the most exciting  Trek movie ever, even more so than Wrath of Kahn.
The farewell sequences  will bring a tear to even the most jaded trekker.  If you grew up with the  series, lived through the long years of re-runs, and enjoyed the movies  then you have to own this movie for posterity.  And it's a damned good  adventure to boot.
Farewell Enterprise 1701-A, you will always be in our  hearts and minds.  For out of your tall tales and adventures will spring  forth the seeds of our own real need to  journey where no man has gone  before.",963446400,8,1161,4.695
464877,4,630242335X,"The Undiscovered Country is better than average Trek fare, following in the wake of the awful Star Trek V.  The storyline is basically sound, projecting the end of the Cold War onto the Federation and the Klingon  Empire.  Even the name of the Klingon chancellor, Gorkon, is a play on  Gorbachev.
Nevertheless, there are some things in this movie that just  don't work for me.  Spock just happens to have a microscpic locator beacon  handy that he slaps on Kirk's jacket just before Kirk beams over to the  Klingon flag ship.  Kirk conveniently manages to keep his jacket with  beacon attached throughout his captivity.  it is also absurd that the  Federation would discuss plans for a secret rescue of Kirk with the Vulcan  ambassador present in the room.  When the Enterprise enters Klingon space  to rescue Kirk, surely the Klingons have the technology to distinguish a  Federation starship from a Klingon supply freighter.  I also do not like  the music that plays in the opening credits, it is too somber in constrast  to the bombastic and epic sounding scores that accompanied the beginning of  the other series entries.  It is also a bummer to have Admiral Cartwright  turn traitor after being a good guy in Star Trek IV.
Still, in spite of  its weaknesses, the original cast do themselves credit and go out in style  in this film.  It is good to see Sulu promoted to command of his own ship.  Christopher Plummer is excellent as the Klingon nemesis Chang spouting  Shakespeare as he torpedoes the Enterprise.  Also, anybody notice the  Christian Slater cameo?  He must have been a Star Trek fan and talked his  way into getting a brief scene, even though his face is half shadowed.  Michael Dorn of TNG cast also has a small part as Kirk and McCoy's Klingon  ""public defender"".

I don't think they could have ended it  better.  In THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY, after a space disaster threaten's the  Klingon's homeworld, Spock convinces a bitter Kirk to escort the Klingon's  Chancellor to a peace talk on Earth, which would end many years of bad  blood between the two nations.  All is going well until the Chancellor's  ship is mysteriously attacked and the Chancellor is killed.  With the  Enterprise to blame for the deed, Kirk and McCoy are arrested and are  sentenced to life imprisonment at a Klingon gulag, and it is up to Spock  and the rest of the crew to uncover the culprits and rescue Kirk and McCoy  before the wrong doers at large can do more harm.  The story is very rich  with twists and turns, the sets, special fx, spaceships and action scenes  are all terrific and look great, I might even add that one of TREK's all  time greatest star fights is in it, with the Enterprise in a torpedo battle  with an invisible starship.  This movie does nothing to disprove a TREK  movie fact, the even numbered ones are the best.

464880,5,630242335X,"There were two themes in this move.  The theme of prejudice, and the ""go to hell, authority"" theme.
This movie captured the moralistic attitude of the original episodes where a science fiction world was used to tackle a  present-day problem.  The movie goes into detail about Kirk's prejudice  toward the Klingon race; how the Klingons are different from the rest of  the members of Starfleet.
Through the course of the movie, other people  are shown to have taken a more extremist stance in their prejudice toward  the Klingons than Kirk, which makes him reevaluate his own prejudice.  Isn't that what happens in life?  We are born with prejudices.  We have  examples of people who fight against those prejudices and people who  epitomize prejudice.  We embrace the fight and scorn those who embody  prejudice.
This movie, more than any other Star Trek movie, exploited  Kirk's defiant attitude.  Every chance to scorn authority was taken by  every regular member of the Enterprise. Spock even says in response to  authority, ""If I were human, I believe my response would be ... go to hell ...  if I were human.""
Worf's minor part in defending Kirk in a Klingon court  was a much better bridge between the series than Generations. In addition,  displaying the signatures of the main cast at the end was an incredible and  fitting final tribute.",958953600,,1345,4.884444444444444

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for  action/adventure film. But once in a while, I get the hankering for  something thought provoking. When was the last Die Hard with a Vegance did  that to you? This movie has expressed what I feel to be a accurate of a lot  of people's feelings about the (then) current events in Russia in the early  90's. This movie really helps kids, teenagers, and people a like that peace  is sometimes neccasarry to fight and that it is worth fighting for. Without  a doubt, one of, if not the best Star Trek films. Director Nicholas Myers  (Time After Time, Star Trek II) produces a fablous thriller air that will  draw you into the experiance. It promotes all the mood and atmosphere of  The Hunt For Red October, will still manageing to send several messages  across that provide points to ponder for hours.
