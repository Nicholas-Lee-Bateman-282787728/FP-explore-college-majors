227929,3,6300209075,"this movie has long been one of my favorites. dissapointed in this transfer tho... tried to find details on the original aspect ratio.... I'm dubious that this was released 1.85:1 in 1955.

227930,2,6300209075,"Shack Out on 101 (Edward Dein, 1955)

Really, did someone think that it was a good idea to combine a beach-blanket picture with a Graham Greene-style spy thriller? Someone must have, because the result is Shack Out on 101, a piece of silliness by the director most known for being responsible for The Leech Woman, that immortal tale of, well, a leech woman. Yeah, that's the kind of ""what were they thinking?"" mentality responsible for this one, too.

The movie centers around a little diner in the middle of nowhere. It's got an owner (Keenan Wynn), a mediocre fry cook (Lee Marvin), and a gorgeous cashier (Terry Moore), as well as a bunch of delivery people who seem as if they're also the place's only customers. The big news, however, is that Slob, the fry cook, is the lynchpin in a smuggling ring that's funneling secrets from the local nuclear weapons research facility to the commies. Or something like that. It's kind of hard to tell, because the script here seems as if it were an afterthought, put together for the sole purpose of getting a large number of stars in one place and giving them the kind of anti-communist screed to parrot that played well during the McCarthy years.

While there's little of worth to be had here from any standpoint, there are quite a few decent laughs here. Some are intentional, some not, but the end result is the same. Marvin and Wynn both chew scenery as much as possible, probably egged on from behind the camera to give their over-the-top silliest, while Moore is a walking, talking Spy Hard version of a Beach Blanket Bingo ""I'm not an airhead, I just play one on TV"" character. The whole thing is so ludicrous it ends up being kind of fun; don't go in expecting a high-octane noir thriller (as I did) and you'll have a great deal of fun with this. **",1277251200,6,1801,4.552469135802469
227931,3,6300209075,"Cute, curvy Terry Moore is definitely watchable in this oddball propaganda flick.  As a sweet, niave waitress in an isolated hashhouse and the only gal around, she's the hub around which most of the action revolves.  Several men lust for her, most notably Keenan Wynn, the gruff beanery proprietor, Lee Marvin, the slovenly hashslinger he calls Slob, and Frank Lovejoy, an undercover fed who's romancing Moore while getting the goods on Marvin.  The movie seems intended as a red-scare soaper and would have been better had it been more menace and less suds.  Too much time is expended on guys groping Moore and verbal-barb back-and-forth between Wynn and Marvin.  Sometimes, you get the feeling that the director told the actors to camp it up to fill in time.  One particularly odd scene has antagonists Wynn and Marvin exercising, bare-chested, in the diner's eating area.  The usual sparring is barely perceptible, and the two check out each other's flabby pecs while jesting jovially.  The effect is hokily homoerotic, pointedly so when Moore walks in and the men bolt for cover--as though she caught them in flagrante!  Apparently the filmmakers figured Americans had already gotten the anti-Marxist message.  So they chose to beat in some time poking fun at gentle guys--Whit Bissell in this case--who are put off by bloodletting and killing for sport.  As a war-weary vet, Bissell seems more together than any of the men except hero Lovejoy, who tells Bissell he needs a psychiatrist--that only professional help can assist him. (An overobvious plug for the emerging psychiatric establishment?)  One gets the feeling that if Marvin is a red, Bissell might be a pinko for not wanting to spear a fish!  The movie has funny moments of the yuck-yuck caliber, but little of the campy commie humor one would expect.  Guys of middle-school mentality, however, should love it!",1032912000,7,1875,5.045454545454546
227932,5,6300209075,"Very enjoyable film about Lee Marvin and Keenan Wynn and espionage. Terry  Moore is a goddess and she's a lot of fun to watch in this film. It's wacky  and serious and melodramatic and totally unlike other cold war films. Watch  it or buy it, but do it soon. It's a rollicking good time!",969235200,11,287,4.277777777777778
227933,4,6300209075,"The story takes place almost exclusively on one set, the titular restaurant. Lee Marvin, plays Slob, a short order cook, with a secret agenda. He is actually buying nuclear secrets form a scientist (Whitt  Bissel) from a local top secret government facility (sound familiar yet?).  Terry Moore has the distinction of being not only the waitress with the  easiest job in the free world (most of her shifts last about 5 minutes),  she is also sexually harassed by every one of her coworkers, her boss, and  all but one customer. She is trying to better herself by taking the civil  service exam, and getting a government job. I guess waiting tables for 30  minutes a day is too much work for her. I know I am sounding sarcastic, but  this is one of those odd films I saw on late night TV, and when I told my  friends about it, they all claimed I was making it up. Now that it's on  video, I have shown it too them, and as far as I know, they all bought  copies to.

228003,5,6300209075,"Perhaps the most enjoyable bad picture of all time, and certainly the easiest to like. I give it five stars because it's so much fun to watch. The plot is Cold War nonsense about commie spies who happen to be blue-collar doofuses plus an intellectual who may or not be a Soviet agent. None of that matters. It's all about a good cast acting out a silly yarn as if it were an Arthur Miller play. In an early, pre-movie-star role, Lee Marvin steals the show. Unlike bad movies of the Ed Wood variety, the whole thing is so well done that you actually follow the plot.",1413849600,2,565,4.289719626168225
228004,4,6300209075,"Shack Out On 101  is certainly a cult classic that is indeed, unlike any other film. It is stylishly directed by cult director Edward Dein, who also directed Curse Of The Undead(1959), which has been credited for being the very 1st vampire western ever made. Shack Out is certainly one of the oddest films of the 50's, and takes place all on a single shabby set. The greasy spoon is a secret station for spies, and is close to an experimental lab that harbors national defense secrets and a ring of sinister spies trying to steal them. The cast is actually quite good and features Lee Marvin as ""slob"", who is a short order cook at the dive, which is owned by Keenan Wynn. Marvin also just happens to be a communist agent trying to steal the defense secrets. Terry Moore plays the waitress who is usually referred to as ""tomato"", and is constantly trying to ward off all of the male characters who are trying to maul her. Frank Lovejoy plays the scientist who may or may not be in on the scheme to steal the secrets. Whit Bissell is also thrown into the mix of rather whacky characters. One of the features that makes the film so unique is the amazing, outrageous dialogue. For example, ""slob"" declares ""Life's 90 percent slop"". There is some strange sax music, skin diver suits, flippers, etc. I don't want to give too much away so as not to spoil the film for viewers who have never seen it before. Rest assured, it is certainly unique and features a surprise ending. Overall, the film is rather mean-spirited, specifically in the interactions between all of the strange characters. Another rather interesting fact is that the cinematography, which is very good, was shot by Floyd Crosby, who shot the classic film High Noon in 1952. All in all, between the strange dialogue, the wacky characters, and the set direction, Shack Out is, indeed, a one of a kind experience. The film is 80 minutes long, not 73 minutes, as displayed on the case, shot in black and white, (16x9), 1.78:1, Anamorphic Widescreen. I would recommend the film to any film lover who enjoys 50's style films with rather odd twists. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SMRZ!",1413417600,6,2130,4.634920634920635
228005,4,6300209075,"I gave this monstrosity 4 stars out of sheer, drop-jawed awe. Never, in a lifetime of avid movie going, have I seen such a masterpiece of camp. Really, this thing has to be seen to be believed. Not only is the entire premise bizarre, but the characterizations, the dialogue, and the amazing set pieces are weird beyond the lot of mortal man. There is a long sequence in which Keenan Wynn and Whit Bissel stomp around a diner wearing old fashioned snorkel gear, fins and all. A spear gun and a man-eating marlin play leading roles, although I have to admit that the marlin stayed off screen. His presence was felt, however. Poor Lee Marvin. You could see him struggling to turn in a good performance, but the script would have defeated Gielgud.

Terry Moore is certainly the ""fox"" here, but she's a ""smart"" fox. Also loved the ubiquitous Whit Bissel and Frank Lovejoy is THE man.

228010,4,6300209075,"""Shack Out on 101"" on Blu-Ray?  You've got to be kidding me.  On one level this is a run of the mill Cold War film noir staged in a diner near a (nuclear) research lab.  On another level it's got a menacing early Lee Marvin performance as a fry crook named Slob (yes: Slob) who may be more than he seems.  Into this mix add Keenan Wynn for some truly bizarre moments (lifting weights with Lee Marvin's Slob or playing with deep sea fishing equipment).  Not great film noir, but entertaining as they come -- and amazing to find this long unavailable film on blu-ray.",1384128000,7,565,4.3428571428571425
228011,5,6300209075,"SHACK OUT ON 101 (Allied Artists, 1955) is a movie that's in a class all by itself. The plot - which is really unimportant - centers around a seaside cafe that turns out to be a secret outpost for espionage agents. What IS important is the way writer/director Edward Dien manages to turn a totally nonsensical premise into pure gold entertainment through the expertise of a powerhouse cast, making this one of the greatest cult films of all time.

'50s ""tomato"" Terry Moore stars as a waitress working at Keenan Wynn's hamburger joint where greasy ol' ""Slob"" - Lee Marvin - also works as a cook. Frank Lovejoy is Moore's professor/undercover FBI agent/boyfriend, and Whit Bissell is a shell-shocked WW2 veteran. Sandwiched in between the mostly unintentionally hilarious dialog we have Marvin turning out to be the head of a spy ring  that's stealing national defense secrets. Everyone delivers such sincere performances that they manage to put it over despite the implausibilities. There's never a dull moment in this definitive '50's drive-in classic.

 SHACK OUT ON 101 is one of those movies that's been crying to be released on disc, and Olive Films has finally answered the call with a gorgeous looking Blu-ray transfer that does justice to Floyd Crosby's crisp, black and white cinematography. The film is presented in its correct 1.78:1 aspect ratio. There are no extras.

This is a personal favorite and it's about time it's been given the proper treatment. I only wish Terry Moore would've done a commentary.

My highest recommendation.",1383868800,25,1546,5.01953125

7805239,3,6300209075,"SHACK OUT ON 101 is difficult to give a good review; and there is not one bonus feature on the Olive films release of this sometimes funny sometimes badly acted (see Terry Moore...if she is not gonna' be more likeable then why not do something else with her Terry Moore character...This movie could have changed her 'bad acting' image) sometimes ridiculous B-Movie by a cult director (Edward Dein) I had never heard of before seeing Shack On 101 (Curse of the Undead -- apparently the other good B-movie Dein directed -- I have never seen either).
At the same time I am not giving SHACK a bad review.
SHACK OUT ON 101 opens with (what appears to be) a shot at From Here to Eternity kicking sand in the face of the two lovers on the beach - as the ocean water rolls in - by showing us Terry Moore ""the tomato"" (as she is not so affectionately referred to in movie) despises Lee Marvin ""the slob"" (not so affectionately referred to in movie) to no end.  This is immediately understandable.  ""The slob"" is not very likeable although he does have a sense of humor (he over laughs at ACME POULTRY workers  -- who strangely have soft hands for truck drivers...hmmm -- for terrible chicken joke).
But, how did Dein get the cast for this movie?  Keenan Wynn, Whit Bissell (he was in everything, it seems in 50's) and of course the fast up-and-coming Lee Marvin (Marvin had the scene stealing part of maniacal - but funny - motorcycle gang rival of Brando in The Wild One a year earlier...).  Also, Frank Lovejoy is the love interest.  Must be the name.
Again as ridiculous as this gets (and not being able to decide if it is just entertaining or approaching bad...does ""the slob' gotta be a smartass cook too...?  shoulda' just fired him there...but then there wouldn't be a movie...) the chuckles are true enough with enough one liners to allow the lab! down the road promise of ""traitor"" menace to evolve into pretty much what Shack Out On 101 turns out to be about.
I give the Shack 3 stars cuz it was ok for what it was with the originality to make this review worth thinkin' about (this much). I'm just not sure if this was enough time well spent.
The ending was saved - have to admit - by the last laugh.  It's gotta' be difficult to find good help on Highway 101.",1456617600,,2262,4.420673076923077
