8558411,3,B00AWHDFFS,"This is another of the thrown-together baseball DVDs that are done by Marino Amoruso. The guy seems to be a true baseball fan and his made-for-DVD products are probably a labor of love. They're just not very good.

Like the others, this is a collection of Public Domain film clips and still photographs with a narration. It's all stuff you've seen a thousand times if you're a baseball nut like me. For the uninitiated, the story of Jackie Robinson is well worth knowing and, in that sense, this DVD serves a purpose.

A lot of his other releases use the same clips as one another, just rearranged. Like, a Babe Ruth DVD and a Lou Gehrig DVD would be basically the same stuff with a different narration. This Robinson bio isn't quite that bad. That is, until you get to the bonus item. That's when just about every scene is shown again (and the same script is read) while a guy tries playing the role of Jackie.

If you can get it used, that may be your best choice. You'll just kick yourself if you spend much on it.",1416787200,,1017,4.37037037037037

8558413,4,B00AWHDFFS,"Before you go see the upcoming big screen ""42,"" starring Harrison Ford, Christopher Meloni and Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, you may want to see this award-winning documentary about the real Robinson. ""Jackie Robinson: My Story"" tells his life story ithrough rare footage and photographs from real life.

And it gives you an intense performance of Stephen Hill (Dead Man Down). ""My Story"" is just that. In a locker room setting, Hill as Robinson materializes to discuss his life and times directly to the camera -- to you, to young people.

This is a remarkable story about a towering American icon, not only of baseball, but of political activism, civil rights, the media and the changing times. The account is direct and honest, not only about Robinson's struggle to equality that seemed impossible at the time, but also of his issues with his people, his family and his son.

Hill's performance is understated, straightforward and matter-of-fact, which makes the moment he reflects on the loss of his son all the more effective. It should be noted that some language, particular racial slurs, are heard in this film, vicious things that were said in a less enlightened time.

As a production of limited budget but a lot of heart, ""My Story"" makes fine use of its source material. Even the music seems to fit the sequences.

The bonus feature, ""Jackie Robinson: An American Hero"" is a shorter version of the feature, using much of the same sources and a condensed edition of the same script. Perhaps this was created for groups and schools. It contains none of the offensive phrases heard in the other film.

Warren Schaeffer, who was also Director of Photography of ""My Story,"" narrates offscreen. This distances the viewer from the impact of the dramatic story when compared to Hill speaking right to us in ""My Story."" Schaeffer does an earnest job, but it cannot compare to the effect carried off in the longer film. One wonders why they simply didn't edit ""My Story"" down, but perhaps the short film was made first.

It's worth mentioning the there was also a 1950 movie called The Jackie Robinson Story with the real Robinson playing himself. Considering his influence on history, it's about time a new movie is being released to theaters. This video makes a nice companion. Either way, this is a story worth telling and remembering.",1364947200,3,2347,4.881909547738694
