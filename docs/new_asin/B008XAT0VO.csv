5188621,5,B008XAT0VO,"I ordered this 2-DVD set because I've been looking for the movie, ""There's A Girl In My Soup"" for several years & have never been able to find it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn make for an excellent comedy team. I used to really enjoy watching the film when it ran on TV, many, many years ago. When I learned it was getting a new DVD release I was really happy. As a bonus, I like the other movies in this set also. Modern Romance starring Albert Brooks is a real gem, plus Dudley Moore, Gene Wilder, & Gilda Radner. Wow! Excellent choice! This DVD from Mill Creek offers 4 films from The Columbia Pictures vaults, presented in widescreen, and the image quality is excellent. I ordered this not knowing what to expect...It's all good!",1358899200,10,734,4.444444444444445
5188622,5,B008XAT0VO,"I don't know how many people are still trying to replace there old VHS tapes with DVD/Blue Ray but I am and boy o boy that can be costly!  So, when I see a DVD/Blue Ray that has more than one movie on them I'm always happy especially with the deal I received on this DVD.  Now, I didn't buy my copy of this DVD from Amazon but I did just buy it from Family Dollar for $5.00 dollars and I was more than pleased with my copy.  The disc has two movies on each Micki and Maude/Hanky Panky then the other one is There's a Girl in My Soup/Modern Romance!

I just took a chance on this disc and I didn't expect much in the terms of quality but I was pleasantly surprised to update my old VHS movies with this DVD!",1357689600,4,706,3.9160839160839163

5188645,5,B008XAT0VO,"There's A Girl In My Soup:  Either Goldie or Peter alone would be sufficient motive for me to watch and love this movie and here are both!  Clever, quirky, entertaining, insightful and the girl is sooo beautiful both then and today.  I saw this a couple of times years ago and still enjoy it fresh today but with some new revelations.

Micki and Maude is a delightful surprise!  Micki has a good heart which this movie proves can lead the host into the most impossible of circumstances that are at once both his fault and totally unavoidable because he does have a good heart.  Yes, the story line does seem a bit quirky and contrived, but it is all too realistic in the possibility that I can see more than a few people get there.

Hanky Panky is Gene Wilder at his zany best but with a big twist this time, he really is a hero.  The plot line is too quirky to even try to describe beyond it is a murder mystery on a roller coaster of hilarity and suspense.  Be advised to leave your disbelief at the opening credits.

Modern Romance.  Maybe it is just me but I have no patience for neuroses milked for entertainment value.  Cathy comic strip Woody Allen movies are the extent of my capacity to find a chuckle in neurotics.  I have had quite a few as acquaintances and even a handful whom I have considered friends, but they were as much from compassion and caring as normal routes to friendship.  I do enjoy most Woody Allen movies but this one I tried to watch a couple of times and I found it so tedious I just turned it off.",1377388800,,1529,4.2822299651567945

5188648,1,B008XAT0VO,Only a small portion of the movie shows on the TV screen.  It's like looking through a door's peep hole.  It is a waste of money.  Unless the people are exactly in the center of the screen you can't see what's going on.  Big disappointment.,1360108800,,240,4.266666666666667

While the ""feature"" here is ""There's a girl..."", the best movie is Albert Brooks' ""Modern Romance"". Every time I've shown this to anyone, they've laughed their asses off.
