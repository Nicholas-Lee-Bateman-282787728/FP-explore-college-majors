8323619,3,6302174643,"This has all the feeling of a Hallmark made for TV movie. The same mind numbing background music (only slightly worse than elevator music.)

However even though you know the formula and pretty much can guess the ending it is still a pretty good time passer.

Jake (Jeff Fahey) a student archeologist finds a clue to the legendary lost treasure of Alexander. He is reluctant to peruse the treasure until he is pushed from behind by being accused of stealing the artifact clue and pulled by the nose by a girl (Camilla More) that has a tendency to go to bed and show of her accoutrements at the drop of a hat.

Will Jake find the treasure before the bad guys?
Does Jake get to keep the sleazy girl?
Will the bad guys triumph in the end?
Or do we all live happily ever after.

The main thrust of the movie is the chase as Jake and his friends snake their way around Egypt and Grease.",1509321600,2,880,4.283132530120482
