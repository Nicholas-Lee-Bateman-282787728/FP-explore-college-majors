6991376,3,B00SLEJ9AY,This was a gift.  The recipient seems to like the DVD.  They like all the Iesodo DVDs so far.  Each episode has a message we all need to hear.,1440115200,,142,3.8275862068965516
6991377,5,B00SLEJ9AY,I bought one Iesodo  DVD for my grandkids and they loved it so much that I bought all the rest of the series. It's truly one of their favorite DVDs to watch in their home and in my car.,1440028800,,185,3.7435897435897436

8698832,1,B00SLEJ9AY,Very disappointed in these series. Certainly does not follow truth.,1490745600,,67,5.8
8698833,4,B00SLEJ9AY,"I like this story line. It's a really cute show.
My little one who is 5 will watch them back to back to back.
I do feel like unless your kids are learning about these bible stories from parents, Sunday school, etc.... then they need a little more explanation after watching these series.
The stories are some what vague and they're birds with different names in the scriptures so it kind of confused my little one.
But great messages!",1489708800,,434,4.506329113924051
8698834,5,B00SLEJ9AY,"Not as long at the desciption.  One 12 mins, one 15.  Has some great extras for help teach. Great stories. Kids really like it.",1487894400,,127,4.25
8698835,1,B00SLEJ9AY,Wasnt what i was expecting.  I don't think i heard the name of Jesus Christ once.,1486425600,2,81,4.0625
8698836,5,B00SLEJ9AY,"My grandkids & I love the Iesodo series of movies.  Each video teaches about one of the Fruits of the Spirit or the Character God works to build within a person after they come to Christ as their Savior.

Iesodo portrays Jesus.  Each of the bird characters is a character from the Bible.  Maggie is Mary Magdalene, for instance.  Other characters get introduced over the course of the entire series...Matt is the apostle Matthew, Tom is the apostle Thomas, etc

Their are catchy tunes and easily-memorized lyrics to the songs that weave through the events of the stories.  My grandkids will burst out singing those songs as they are playing, riding in the car, walking around the block; they songs stick with them & may likely be what makes more sense to them later on in years at a time when they truly need to lean on the lesson they teach.

.I've been buying more as gifts for others and have finally finished off buying the rest of the series for myself.",1480377600,,958,4.52906976744186
8698837,2,B00SLEJ9AY,No Gospel message.  The main point was you can be good and it is never to late.  What about our need for a Savior!  Jesus is God;  He paid for our sins on the cross.! I will probably just throw it away.,1470960000,2,202,3.738095238095238

8698839,5,B00SLEJ9AY,My 3 year old granddaughter loves these DVDs.  It's hard to find good Christian cartoons that don't look cardboard or cheesy.  These have a great message and are done very well.  Very pleased!,1461715200,,192,4.757575757575758
