2454546,5,6162622088,"If car chases and explosions are how you rate a movie, then BLIND is not for you.  Unlike most of the usual Hollywood drivel, BLIND is an intelligent film with a smooth, consistent pace that allows for contemplative and revealing character development.  Alec Baldwin, Demi Moore and Dylan McDermott are all perfectly cast and perform as you'd expect.  There's a twist that caught me off guard, and the ending could not be more satisfying.  BLIND is a winner!",1500249600,2,458,4.833333333333333

2454553,5,6162622088,"We rented this movie from Red Box last night, but I had to write a review, here.  This was a great.  Alec Baldwin can't turn any character around and did a superb job as a blind person.  Never trust a best friend.  Honeypots!!! Demi Moore's fake girlfriend who was having an affair with her Husband.  As for Dylan McDermott, He played a great control freak!!!  The ending was wonderful.",1514419200,,386,4.521739130434782

2454572,4,6162622088,"Loved the movie.  There are some great lines in this movie that I have used in my daily life.  Not sure why it did not fare better at the box office.  Tough to have a movie with spousal abuse and have it smell rosy in the end.  For the most part society has zero tolerance for such behavior in real life, or be it fictitious on the screen.  The magnetism between Demi and Alec's characters was amazing and makes this a movie worth watching.",1506988800,,440,4.190476190476191

2454582,2,6162622088,"For the first half I thought this was going to be an intelligent and creative story (something that hasn't been told a thousand times already), but then it just became pedestrian predictable from that point on. A quadrangle love affair with cheating, getting caught, changing your mind and the obvious changing tit again. Making it all worse was a predictable, maudlin, everyone ends up with their new lover happily ever after ending. As far as acting Baldwin did a respectable job with his, at times overacted, blind character while Moore was ""just there"".

Really positive reviews to some extent are fandom followers of Baldwin & Moore together with a slight inclination toward seeing Moore act.",1505520000,,697,5.060869565217391

2454602,5,6162622088,"Such an under-rated pleasure. It's mature, thoughtful and these three actors make a terrific ensemble. It's so rare to find a movie to watch that actually relies on a well-acted script that takes us away rather than some ""mega-movie blow-up the world CGI"" garbage. Anyone rating this movie less than four stars clearly knows nothing of what movies really ought to be - a story-telling escape. I have watched this movie multiple times now and will continue to enjoy and appreciate this gem of a story.",1503014400,5,500,4.825581395348837

2454606,3,6162622088,I liked it. Baldwin is always great. Demi looks amazing and seeing her made me miss her and how much she used to work. The cast was like old friends I missed. It is worth a spin if only to hear them talk about writing and books thru the movie because it is like a forgotten art form.,1501977600,5,283,3.896551724137931

2454612,4,6162622088,"There are a great many positive things to say about this film and, after having considered those, I eventually arrived at a four star rating.  One of the concepts that impressed me was the representation of the character of the inside trading money worshipper.  Let's face it - many of these people are covertly (and at times even openly) admired on some levels, and ""white collar"" criminals are usually considered to be less despicable than the average imprisoned.felon.  However, that character here let us see the vicious, brutal nature that really drives the type of man hiding inside that $1,000.00 pairs of shoes.  These are men whose actions render pensions useless, result in enormous job losses, destroy companies and bankrupt stock holders.  This film showed us how ugly these people can be outside of the office and why they should be considered as part of the same groups of low-lifes that contain those who commit crimes against society.  Financial crimes should not be somehow ""elevated"", and those who commit them belong in standard prisons - not the country club, minimum security institutions where they generally end up.

""Blind"" overtly offered us a pretty realistic look at one of these white collar criminals - who far too many times are portrayed as otherwise harmless individuals.  I commend that.

All in all, some fairly interesting character studies and some decent observations on people who must deal with - or at times, create - life altering events while nearly past middle age.  If you're considerably younger, this film probably won't have a great deal of meaning to you - especially if you aren't yet aware of the difference between ""bad acting"" and subtlety.",1501372800,5,1692,5.010714285714286
2454613,1,6162622088,"It was surprisingly corny, predictable and not good acting overall.  Not worth the money or time.  I was disappointed.",1501372800,,118,5.157894736842105
2454614,1,6162622088,"SPOILER ALERT--not that it matters bc this movie is the worst. Really bad acting, music, script...everything about this movie is terrible. An example---when she (Demi Moore) finds out that her husband is cheating on her (after she already cheated on him), she explains to his lover that he prefers 3 minute eggs rather than 5 minute eggs. Seriously --of all the things that she could have said the writers chose that line?! And Demi Moore's face is so tight it looks like it's going to crack.",1501200000,,492,4.732558139534884

2454622,3,6162622088,"It wasn't half bad, with the caveat that I have the biggest soft-spot for Alec Baldwin, despite his history of not being able to keep his big, flapping mouth shut when he's angry.
It was especially sweet to see he and Demi Moore together again after starring in  the awesome film adaptation of John Grisham's book, ""The Juror"".Tremendous chemistry. Dylan McDermott was also in another Grisham story, if only for a few minutes, ""Runaway Jury"". He is great in all his good-guy roles, but it was fun to see him do a good job as a nasty sociopath in ""Blind"". P.S. ALEC played the sociopath in ""The Juror"".",1500681600,5,601,4.564814814814815

2454624,5,6162622088,"Just a good movie - don't look for action scenes or shoot outs, etc. Just a story about 3 adults and how their lives intertwine and then with a lovely ending that leaves you feeling happy. I loved it.",1500681600,2,200,4.153846153846154

Alec Baldwin was kinda hot back then, but in this I was buying that he was ""Blind"" and the whole ""Poor little Rich Girl/Older house wife"" thing with Demi Moore in this movie made me want to barf.",1500508800,2,405,4.139240506329114
