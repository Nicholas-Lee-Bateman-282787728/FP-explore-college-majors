2828033,5,B000PSR3N4,"Was forced to watch this mini-series on on Youtube (10 minutes a clip)with Spanish subtitles, which actually helped me translate the accents of several  characters as I am used to RP English.  Why isn't it available in US format?  BBC needs to understand that Richard Armitage's fans are legion and ravenous for more, more, more.

The novel Wuthering Heights is a real downer of a read, parts of it are gripping but the rest is wilderness and madness, like the moors itself.  Plus, necrophilia and inter-generational inbreeding are not very romantic when you come right down to it.  That being said, this rework of Bronte's story is set  in the present with some post-modern sex changes.  Heathcliff's character is embodied in Carol (Sarah Smart), Cathy becomes Andrew (Joe McFaddlen) and John Standring (Richard Armitage) is an amalgam of the doomed siblings, Isabella and Edgar Hareton.  The Heathcliff character works really well as a female role but Cathy's repression and hysteria don't translate as well for a male part.  For all you 3S BBC Robin Hood fans, there is a special treat, Holly Grainger (the actress who plays Meg) as a teenager!

And yes, RA is good in it, although his body language and appearance are quite different than the heroic Mr. Thornton&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-South/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North & South</a>&nbsp;or the sadistic Sir Guy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood-Seasons-1-2/dp/B001BSBC1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood: Seasons 1-2</a>.  This was made in 2002 (RA is a beardless brunette) and since that time he has matured quite nicely in my opinion!!  Beware, this searing tragedy has gripping performances all the way round and it is almost impossible to quit watching it so plan to allot three hours before you start.",1246752000,22,1894,5.76978417266187
2828034,5,B000PSR3N4,"I just saw this, after ordering from Amazon UK, and loved it.  It was even better than I expected.  The theme is a romance modeled after Wuthering Heights, with two lovers bonded inseparably.  Haunting and tragic, but very well acted.  I thought all the actors were excellent, with Richard Armitage truly exceptional.  Although it was one of his earliest performances, and he is not the leading man, he dominates every scene he is in.  If you like romance or great acting, definitely get this.

Let me add my request for this in USA format, so that I can send copies to my sister and friends.  It's too good not to share.",1246233600,8,621,4.531531531531532
2828035,5,B000PSR3N4,"Ladies...I've been a huge fan of Richard ever since I saw the first season of Robin Hood.  I either tape or buy everything I can.  You can buy a region-free dvd (if you don't want to mess with changing the codes on your present DVD), just search region-free dvd on AZ and there you go.  I would also like to mention Amazon.uk and audiobooks.uk.  I bought the audio reading of Bernard Cornwall's Lords of the North from the UK just to hear his voice.  ALL CDs play on all CDs...no matter where they're from.  Put me down as one who wants ALL of RA's movies on Region 1 format.  (I've also pre-ordered the seventh season of MI-5 a.k.a. Spooks - which comes out in October - from Amazon. UK.)  I am a SERIOUS Richard Armitage fan.  Maybe if enough of us write, Amazon.com will listen.  Keep at it.",1239235200,9,794,4.304054054054054
2828036,5,B000PSR3N4,"Okay I have never written a review before although I have bought tons of stuff from Amazon but this time I could not keep silent. I gave this 4 stars and have never seen the movie but from all the reviews I have read here and elsewhere it sounds really good. I fell in love with North and South (who wouldnt)and thought I would check this movie out. Very disapointed I can't get it here. Would buy it in a minute if it was a U.S. formatted dvd. Come on whats the hold up????? There are way too many BBC fans here in the states for this not to be on DVD here! Hope it will be soon. Oh, and yes I too am a RA fan.",1236729600,19,611,3.8188976377952755

Amazon needs to get up to speed on this.  Please make the US format available; there are a lot of RA fans waiting.....",1224460800,8,283,4.203703703703703

2828042,5,B000PSR3N4,I would like to see this movie! Netflix doesn't have it.....I'm a new Richard Armitage fan. North and South was brilliant! So I've set out to see other movies with the guy in it. Amazon only has the PAL version of this flick! I live in AMERICA Amazon! Hello?? Please get this show in REGION 1 compatible form!,1201132800,60,309,4.344827586206897
2828043,4,B000PSR3N4,"Be forewarned--some of this miniseries is not easy to watch and the main character tends to be somewhat unlikeable at the best of moments.  That said, I began watching this very late one night with the intention of seeing only the first part and was mesmerized to the point that I stayed up until some ungodly hour to see the whole thing.  The two leads are well matched for the most part, but some of the acting is a little too histrionic and over the top.  Better service is done by several of the supporting players; an almost unrecognizable (at first) Richard Armitage in one of his very early roles will break your heart as the good guy, Celia Imrie as the betrayed wife, and finally a very young Holiday (now Holly) Grainger as the daughter will also tug at your heartstrings (Robin Hood fans will recognize her from Season 3).

Also, for those of you who have not yet purchased a regionless DVD player, prices have come down considerably and believe me--it's more than worth it.  There are too many wonderful things out there to see that aren't available in a region 1 version.  You'll be glad you did, honest!",1349827200,4,1117,4.532338308457711

2828045,4,B000PSR3N4,"Why stress? 220-electronics.com has a huge variety of code free, all region pal/NTSC players on the Internet for sale. The Pioneer :DV-420V-k is highly rated & on sale now for $79.00. It's the one I bought. It's great and hard coded inside the DVD player to translate PAL format to NTSC. You switch a setting on your remote menu SIMPLE and that's it! The sales guy from 220- spoke English and I got it in 2 days. Pal to NTSC & hard coded is the way to go. Avoid software download types. This movie is not a family movie. It has adult content. I'm not too crazy about Whethering Heights and this adaptation is so extreme that it really stands alone and IMO is a superior story to WH. The characters are so well developed. You can't help rooting for Carol & John. John's character (R.Armitage) is a simple and honest farmhand (non-smelly because you're blinded by his great qualities) who possesses common sense, compassion, patience, gentleness, strength and loving kindness not to mention A LOOKER, makes me melt. If you could put a picture to the definition of wanker Carol's dad fits the bill. If you could put a picture to the definition of drama queen...Andrew would suffice. He is the epitomy of pathetic too. Because I can't stand his character sometimes I have to FForward. The dialog in the UK productions that I have seen are obviously more intelligent and superior. It's best to get an all region DVD player. With today's technology it's a snap.",1319587200,5,1455,4.6434108527131785
2828046,4,B000PSR3N4,Ive recently just watched North and South on Netflix and I have really come to like and absolutely adore Richard Armitage and unfortunately it is quite hard to find  or get the movie Sparkhouse!

2828047,5,B000PSR3N4,"I am an avid BBC fan...Netflix has some but there are so many more that I would love to own. As for Richard Armitage..besides being gorgeous he is such a talented and diverse actor. From the Vicar of Dibley to North and South, etc..... I was ready to buy a BluRay dvd so I actually ordered a Region free BluRay so that I could order the UK titles offered. Wuthering Heights is my favorite novel of all times and the two together,,,RA & WH..!! Also ordering Chris Ryan's Strike Back/Sky One because Richard Armitage stars in the first two seasons. With all the fans pleading for American DVDs..Amazon should be listening!",1296432000,10,620,4.594594594594595

2828050,5,B000PSR3N4,"Richard Armitage totally makes this miniseries worthwhile.  Otherwise, well, it's okay.
The two leads who love each other and simultaneously drive each other mad get a bit tiresome.  She's White Trash, and he's a whiny Rich Kid who does stupid things like banging his head against brick walls (no, really).  HE is the worst character, as he doesn't want WT to be with anyone else, yet he's married to another woman.  SHE is almost as bad, leading another guy along (that would be Richard Armitage; she even proposes to him, and then she marries him), while she pines for her REAL love, Rich Kid.  Sound confusing?  It's not, really.  Forget the plot; just watch it to enjoy Richard Armitage.  (Oh, glory!)",1275177600,11,705,4.768595041322314

8193230,5,B000PSR3N4,"Took a while to arrive, but probably due to weather and holidays. Item was in stated condition.
The film itself was a good one. I really enjoyed the story. I saw SOME similarities to Bronte's Wuthering Heights. However, overall, I felt this story was a much different story with other elements not found in Wuthering Heights. I did not care for the abrupt ending AT ALL!
***SPOILER ALERT***
Wuthering heights did not end once Catherine died. Heathcliffe lived and was haunted by her until his death. After Andrew's death, the movie just ends with Carol leaving with her husband and daughter. I wanted more. The story was by no means over, even though the film ended. I recommend that others who haven't seen the film to view it. It's definitely worth watching and even owning. Just be prepared to be let down by the unfinished ending. Those of us who happen to know the original story and previous films, I suppose, can simply use our imaginations concerning what should be. However, those who are not familiar with the original(s) are being cheated for sure!",1484006400,,1059,4.760869565217392

8193235,3,B000PSR3N4,"Intriguing iteration of Wuthering Heights featuring a woman in the Heathcliff role.  It doesn't work completely (the boy is so wimpy and the girl is too unlikable).  Richard Armitage fans, you'll be surprised at his work in this; it's quite different from anything he has done since but, in keeping with his acting prowess, he runs away with the movie when he's on screen.",1405468800,3,372,4.796875
8193236,5,B000PSR3N4,"Loved the story I bought this because I love the actor Richard Armitage. I recommend this to all of his fans and to others that love, love stories it was great acting by all.",1395187200,2,174,4.147058823529412
8193237,4,B000PSR3N4,"Carol is a strong character, a woman who has had to deal with serious hardships in her life and mistreatment by her father and boyfriend and neglect by her mother, all whilst caring for her younger sister and enduring the ostracization of her community. Although the main ""love story"" portrayed in this movie is between Carol and Andrew, it doesn't work for me at all. Andrew is a self-absorbed, immature idiot. I spend most of his time on screen pretending that I'm squishing his head between my fingers, just to get through his scenes, because he's such a waste of time.

Happily, Richard Armitage plays John, the only really good man in the whole situation, and in my mind, John and Carol are the *real* love story. Although the ending isn't an obviously happy one, at least it ends on a hopeful note, leaving the door open for Carol to finally be able to build a healthy life for herself.

Excellent acting from all involved. If you like Wuthering Heights, you'll probably find this movie an interesting twist on the theme. If you don't like Wuthering Heights, well, at least you got to watch a movie with Richard Armitage in it. :-D",1390262400,4,1137,4.623762376237623
8193238,4,B000PSR3N4,"I would give it 4.5 stars but I can't make that work.  I was eager to view this, to see some early Richard Armitage.  Since I am in the U.S. and the DVD is formatted for England/Europe I watched it on my computer.  I can only do that 4 times according to the computer so I watched the whole 3 hour DVD at one time (rather than break into two nights and thereby use up 2 of my 4 opportunities.  Kind of like the three wishes from a genie---you don't want to waste a wish!)  The location shots were amazing and the story was gripping.  John (Richard Armitage) is not the dashing handsome character we are used to seeing Richard play but he stole my heart anyway.  The story ends in tragedy but you hope that the surviving characters will be able to rise above it all and carry on.  I was just thinking of using one of my ""wishes"" and watching it again.  I will have to invest in a multi-region DVD player sooner or later in order to view more of Mr. Armitage's work.",1376611200,2,964,4.139784946236559
