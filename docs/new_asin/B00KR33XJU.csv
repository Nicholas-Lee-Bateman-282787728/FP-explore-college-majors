6444389,5,B00KR33XJU,"We are all Kings, for sure, and this video does them and all of us Los Angelenos justice.  I've been a huge Kings fan since 1988 when the Great One headed west.  This disc was better than the 2012 bd I bought as well.  One of the extras includes a summary of all 16 teams in the playoffs and the highlights of the series and progression to Lord Stanley's finale.  This extra alone was about an hour and was really cool.  This dvd/bd is definitely worth it, even if you pay twice the price!  Only complaint was the horrible personality interviewing some of the players in another extra included on the disc.  It was so great to see the players in street clothes (ok, Kings black polos!) and hear them speak and interact with each other and the interviewer (they were interviewed in groups of 2-3, in their O or D lines).  Another really cool extra for sure and I am glad it was included.  BUT the interview was so ping pongy with no personality or follow-up questions.  I should have been conducting it!  The interviewer was very black and white and move on to the next.  Kinda lame; these interviews could have been so much better so easily.

But that really was only complaint.  The main event was done quite well, which is why I focused on the extras as even these were worthy.  Thank you to the production team for sure!

6444396,5,B00KR33XJU,"So many great moments during the run for their 2nd Stanley Cup Championship in 3 years.  From being the only 4th team in history to come back 3-0 in the series against the Sharks to beating the big city on the east coast, it has it all.

This run also has the first playoff series against the Ducks.  The rematch against the defending 2013 champion Blackhawks had so many comebacks.  This bluray will keep you entertained as the Kings face 3 game 7 elimination rounds en route to face off against the New York Rangers.  Sure to be watched yearly as with the 2012 blu ray.  Here's hoping they can repeat in 2015.",1411516800,,611,4.3628318584070795

It chronicles the run for the cup, starting with the disappointing loss to the Blackhawks in the conference finals of the previous year, which only serves to make the satisfaction of beating them on the way to the championship that much sweeter.

6444421,5,B00KR33XJU,"This Blu Ray is much, much better than the one for 2012.  There are three main highlights:  1) No Matthew Perry; 2) No Matthew Perry; and, 3) No Matthew Perry.

Actually, most of the highlights are from ice level and use an open mic.  So, even if you have watched the TV highlights of each goal several times, you might not recognize the goal because it is happening at ice level in real time on this blu ray. This gives us views of the goals not available during the games.

I really liked the editorial job too.  They really put a big focus on the Blackhawks and Rangers games and all the drama surrounding them.",1408060800,4,614,4.2956521739130435
