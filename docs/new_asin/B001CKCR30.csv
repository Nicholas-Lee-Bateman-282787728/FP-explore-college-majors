3514223,5,B001CKCR30,WONDERFUL WAY TO SHARE GOD AS THE CREATOR WITH YOUR CHILDREN. THE SONGS ARE SO MUCH FUN TO SING ALONG TO AND YOUR KIDS WILL REMEMBER THEM!,1234310400,6,138,4.148148148148148
3514233,3,B001CKCR30,"I prefer a more informational video with visual aids and good scenes and visual aids this video has both but in a fast paced and kid oriented style. I like the product. It does what it says, arrived in good condition and able to use it for my purposed.",1372982400,2,252,4.163265306122449
3514234,5,B001CKCR30,"The kids like this (and so do we, the parents).  It's good to teach our kids about how the world really began and not the lies that public schools teach, and this video helps.",1369440000,2,175,4.147058823529412
3514235,1,B001CKCR30,"Then just buy 'em this video and watch those pesky IQ points drop like flies! Once you're kids are sufficiently dumbed down, then there won't be any need to save for college, and you you can take all of your savings down to the Indian casino. Of course, your kid won't be employable, but hey, there's always Walmart! You can spend your golden years with junior living in your basement, and even though he won't get any healthcare benefits, he will be able to get you a fat discount on your Depends undergarments.",1367539200,8,512,4.516129032258065
3514236,5,B001CKCR30,I purchased this DVD to replace our old VCR tape.  I thought it was worth replacing.  This is one of the best creationist videos out there about dinosaurs.  It was professionally done and keeps the kids' attention.  The whole family thinks this is a winner.,1359763200,7,257,4.644444444444445
3514237,5,B001CKCR30,Has become the 5 year old grandson's favorite. We are glad that someone has offered the alternative to all the PC dinosaur information out there.,1354579200,3,145,4.84
3514238,5,B001CKCR30,Elementary kids love it and learn.  It is a great teaching tool that keeps the kids interested all the way through.,1339372800,5,115,4.476190476190476
3514239,5,B001CKCR30,"My kids ages 7 and 10 absolutely love this video.  What a wonderful tool for teaching apologetics to children.  It is a bit silly, but really appeals to children.  I hope that Answers in Genesis will come out with more of these videos.",1332288000,6,235,4.4186046511627906
3514240,5,B001CKCR30,This is an excellent dvd - showed things I had not heard before like the word dinasaur wasn't even invented till the 1800 so how could the name be in the Bible - it's a wonderful tool for kids to get the other side of what they are being taught in school. I highly recommend it.,1294617600,4,278,3.982142857142857
3514241,5,B001CKCR30,"I must tell you upfront that I am a Christian and believe that God created the earth in six literal days and rested on the seventh day and made it holy.  That being said, I want to say that this video is wonderful for kids (and quite enjoyable for adults, too).  It talks about the facts and defines exactly what is science-something that is observable, repeatable, etc.  Many of the other reviews talk about this video claiming that science proves creation, but that is not so.  It states facts and interprets it based on a creationists view.  Creation and evolution are both religions or beliefs, not science.  Science is interpreted by a person's world view (creationist or evolutionist).  This video is a wonderful alternative to interpreting the facts when so many of our children are indoctrinated from early on to believe that evolution is fact instead of the theory (or religion) that it is.",1292716800,4,899,4.798701298701299
3514242,5,B001CKCR30,"I, AS RELIGIOUS TEACHER, STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN PARENT AND RELIGIOUS TEACHER. KIDS FROM AGE 7 TO 10 REALLY LIKE THIS SHOW. IT IS OF GREAT HELP IN EXPLANING WHY EVOLUTION AND BIG BANG HYPOTESIS IS UNLOGICAL. GREAT THING IS THAT  IT GIVES SOME OF GEOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS FOR YOUNG EARTH AND INFORMATION ABOUT UNFOSSILIZED DINOSAUR BONES AND UNFOSSILIZED T-REX SOFT TISSUE AND BLOOD CELLS AS STRONG EVIDENCE OF YOUNG HISTORY OF LIFE ON ONLY THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD EARTH. IT IS ALSO HUMOROUS AND DYNAMIC MATERIAL. GREAT !

IVAN (CROATIA)",1269734400,9,556,4.967741935483871
8288125,5,B001CKCR30,Great DVD about creationism vs. evolution.  Kids through elementary and even above will enjoy this.,1514764800,,99,5.6
8288126,1,B001CKCR30,Great if you want to your kids to be science denying retards who can't do simple google searches to prove almost everything in the movie wrong. Just wait till your kids ask questions to their teachers related to the subject matter and never trust their parents to teach them anything factual ever again!,1483747200,2,303,4.735849056603773
8288127,5,B001CKCR30,"With unscientific garbage such as this, these willingly ignorant young earth creationists will doom themselves by pushing their cause back off the cliff.  If you have to invent your own ""science"" to justify your belief in an anonymous bronze age collection of hearsay...it might mean you're just wrong.",1481846400,3,302,5.291666666666667
8288128,5,B001CKCR30,"My children were coming to that awful age where they were asking so many questions that the Bible couldn't answer. Locking them in the prayer closet didn't help, and their Sunday visits with our local preacher only brought them home looking depressed (I cant imagine why; the man is so affectionate with them, hugging them all the time. Ungrateful little brats!)
I prayed every morning, noon, evening, and night that they would stop endangering their souls by being so curious-- As we all know, science is the Devil! I worried that one of my children might even be the Antichrist, and that drastic measures would need to be taken.
That is, until I found this movie.
It solved all my problems. This film shook the Devil right out of them and crushed their unnatural desire to learn and become scientist heathens. I cannot express in words how proud I was the day my daughter came to me and told me that she wanted to have lots of babies instead of graduating high school (as is her place in a good Godly home, Amen!)
I was especially impressed by the way there is not one single drop of legitimate scientific fact in this film; of course I expected the Biblical Creationist heroes to fall in line with the fantasies that we all play along with in order to keep God from smiting us all in a great fiery inferno, but what I did not expect was that the evolutionist character would be so blatantly wrong about every aspect of how evolution works according to real-world scientists. The idea that scientists are bumbling idiots has to be the best white lie you can ever tell your kids.
And as a bonus, it saved my marriage! You wouldnt believe how excitable my husband gets at the sight of a genius Creationist putting an idiot evolutionist scientist in his place! You never see that sort of thing in the real world, of course, so its like this film was tailor made by God Almighty Himself to aid me and my husband in making more babies to glorify His name! AMEN!!",1481846400,5,1959,4.50561797752809
8288129,3,B001CKCR30,Was ok for kids but is pretty cheesy and annoying to listen to/view as an adult.  I'm looking for quality alternative resources to teach my kids a biblical creationis view instead of evolution.  This is a resource but I wouldn't choose it if I'd seen it first. Also the sound quality came and went during the viewing.,1463443200,,317,4.543859649122807
8288130,4,B001CKCR30,"Love the biblical knowledge my kids get while also learning about science, geology and history.",1451433600,,95,5.4
8288131,5,B001CKCR30,Fun for the kids!,1449360000,,17,3.5
8288132,1,B001CKCR30,"I'm only giving this one star because I can't give it 0.  I have been using a lot of Answers In Genesis material for our children's ministry, which has been useful in helping them to understand more about how God created the earth and how all the animals could fit on the ark etc. I've seen Buddy in some of that material and after reading the glowing reviews I decided to give this video a try.  What a mistake.  This video is so disjointed and confusing, my 16 year old daughter and I couldn't even following everything that was happening.  To be honest we only watched maybe 5 minutes and I decided to return it, another big mistake.  I would have gotten more for it if I tried to sell it on a yard sale.  Since Amazon so kindly assessed us a restocking fee, I am getting a whopping $2.95 refund....
  Item Refund: $14.99
  Item Tax Refund: $0.90
  Return Shipping Fee Refund Deduction: ($4.98)
  Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: ($7.95)
So be very sure you want to buy this...I wish I hadn't!  I really feel guilty for wasting our church's budget on this!",1437609600,5,1059,4.442708333333333
8288133,2,B001CKCR30,it is too silly too noisy for adults and it might for kids it might be like shows from cartoon network. it doesn't give evidence to prove everything was made in 6 days only that it wasn't from billion years ago.,1412985600,,211,4.170731707317073
8288134,5,B001CKCR30,"My kids love Buddy Davis, this movie has a lot of information. Great for any age, we enjoy this movie and the others Buddy Davis has participated in and Answers in Genesis videos.",1386547200,,179,4.454545454545454
