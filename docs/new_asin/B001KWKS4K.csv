They have Christian values and that is show through out the movies.

3673968,5,B001KWKS4K,"This is a series that the entire family will enjoy.

The 6 part series offers everything from feeling good to touching moments.

Once you see this series, I can almost guarantee you that you'll be hoping for more series to be produced.

I paid a tad more than $50.00 for these DVDs, but after watching them, I would have paid $100.00 easily knowing what I know now.

Janette Oke's writings in connection with Michael Landon Jr's. production is absolutely brilliantly done.

I highly recommend this 6 series collection.",1245196800,5,518,4.840909090909091

3673971,5,B001KWKS4K,"I really enjoyed the first three movies and I'm waiting to see the fourth. Great representation of life in the frontier. All movies move fast and are filled with joy, at times deep sorrow, but the theme remains the same: the strength of positive thinking and deep faith. True to life? Having lost my husband I shed lots of tears watching the first movie, but hope and love always prevail in this series and I hope that is true for me, too.",1232928000,6,439,4.365853658536586

3673977,5,B001KWKS4K,"I love this series.  Even though I'm a Christian I usually think of Christian fiction as being too lightweight.  It seems that tough issues are either glossed over or have a sappy ending.  This series faces tough issues head-on, and even though there are happy endings, they're not without their complications and difficulties.  Even good lives face troubles, and this series addresses this, but also gives hope.  The acting and cinematography is also much better than the usual Christian fare (although it is getting better).  I also love seeing the Christian life portrayed and not ignored, as if everyone in America had no belief in God.  These are people who believe but still struggle like other people.  They're like me.",1257120000,,726,4.991666666666666
3673978,5,B001KWKS4K,"These all arrived wrapped and in perfect shape.  The series is so moving and sweet.  Perfect for a family to watch  and learn from.  It just makes the simple life, although at times difficult and dangerous, so appealing.  Also shows that through both the painful and joyous times, God is there to help and compfort, to share and rejoice with us.",1255651200,,345,4.590163934426229

i normaly go for sci-fi or action moives but i caught one of these movies on the hallmark channel(cause my wife had it on) and i was so impressed by ""love comes softly"" that i had to have the whole set and after watching the others i was equally moved

3673982,3,B001KWKS4K,"Having read all of the Love Comes Softly series books multiple times, I've been disappointed at the major differences in the movies.  It's not that the movies don't have nice plots and good story-lines.  They're just very dissimilar to the books.  It's like they just basically took the characters names from the books and then wrote a whole new story.  They snagged the title from the book and then put it to a different story. Argh.

It got really annoying as I watched the movies sitting there thinking, ""Wait a minute!  That didn't happen in the book!"" or ""Hey, that's not what this book was about at all.""

The movies were enjoyable to watch with my kids - they didn't know everything that happened in the books, so they weren't disappointed at all.  But I just had a hard time getting past the many, many differences between the books and the movies.

I wouldn't buy these movies - I just rented them from the library.",1249948800,,924,4.551515151515152

This is a wonderful set of movies, but don't buy the six-movie set. Buy the 10th anniversary 10-movie set. You'll be glad.

Not only do you get 10 DVDs, you get them for a great price.

These movies give us a beautiful look at what life was like on the prairies in the late 19th century. Small town rural life seems totally alien to what we are used to today, but these movies are like a painless way to learn about frontier life.

Heartache, life's lessons, bias, and more. These movies don't just show us life, they show us what it means to LIVE.

8316386,5,B001KWKS4K,"This movie series came from Janette Oke's book series. I bought these around Christmas 2009. I've seen all of them on the Hallmark channel before. They are the best Christian Western series ever! I love these DVD's. It shows the true West in the pioneer days & what they went through, including death, illness, famine, etc. It is a great series to watch and you never, ever get tired of watching them. They are all child appropriate, and I know that's important to a lot of families. They are clean movies and they are educational also.

It is based off of christian novels so there isn't all the sexual content and swearing etc.  It is set during the ""pioneer days"" of the past and reminds me a lot of the Laura Ingalls theme, which my daughters were into also.  Very good, tasteful set.",1267056000,,399,4.28
