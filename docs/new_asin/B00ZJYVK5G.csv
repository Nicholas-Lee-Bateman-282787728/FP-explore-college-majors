7283150,5,B00ZJYVK5G,"I think that 3 of these 4 Hammer Films are Classics, and I'm very happy to see them on Blu-ray.
I hope for more of the Classic Hammer library (from all the studios who have USA rights to them!).

I've made my comments on the individual sites for each film:
""The Mummy"" 1959
""Dracula Has Risen From the Grave"" 1968
""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" 1969
""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" 1970
Unfortunately, the 4 discs are not in proper order in the slipcase box containing the films,
and the uninitiated might watch the two Dracula films in reverse order which would lead to some
confusion (which I will not explain as I don't want to spoil anything for the first time viewer).

Hopefully, next year, Warner will release new and improved HD Blu-rays for ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" and
""Horror of Dracula.""

I will say that the box-set here is crammed too tight. I would suggest that once you
remove the booklet that contains the 4 discs that you never put the booklet back into the slip-case
(both for convenience and for the potential damage that such tight packaging can do to the discs.).",1438214400,3,1087,4.592783505154639

7283154,4,B00ZJYVK5G,Only one disc?? $49 list price??!!.. This should be a $24.95 list price. These titles are probably NOT remastered for Blu ray and simply up converted from the DVD masters.

This production cost savings should be passed along to the consumer with a respectable list price. 4 stars for the collection. 1 star for the list price.-Silly.,1435968000,4,428,4.797297297297297

7283169,4,B00ZJYVK5G,"Hammer has never received the love in the U.S. that they did overseas in the UK when it comes to home video. The films, if they received a release from the major studios on DVD or Blu-ray in the U.S., would have no special feature (although Anchor Bay did include them and kudos to them for that) or would features subpar transfers that would leave a lot to be desired (""Horror of Dracula"" with an incorrect aspect ratio that cut off the tops of heads, etc. or the Universal set that, while it featured some nice transfers, were jammed onto dual sided, DVDs that would often free up and with no special features).

It's a shame, really, because when Hammer was producing horror films from 1957 on, their productions, although low budget, had a classy air to them that other studios in the U.S. couldn't match until American International Pictures with Roger Corman as director.

So what does that mean for these films from Warner and why isn't ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse of Frankenstein"" part of this set rather than 60's and 70's sequels?

Let's answer the last question first--Warner has been upgrading their library with new transfers for ALL of their ""assets"". All of these films received new ly struck IP (interpositives--the best source for a transfer as they feature better detail, etc.--prints are rarely used to create a Blu-ray or high def release) 2K transfers. What does that mean? As it states--they are NEW not older HD transfers as some have claimed. They look it. While they haven't received a restoration with the touch up of scratches, etc., these films look better in high definition than they ever have (at least on this side of the pond for ""The Mummy""). These are, however, are all going to be only as good as the source that Warner has to work with which would also explain some shortcomings in the sound for a portion at the conclusion of ""The Mummy"". It also explains WHY they haven't been remixed for 5.1 or 7.0 as the only source that Warner has for the soundtrack are the original mono stems transferred for the films.

Because of the condition of ""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse of Frankenstein"" both films ARE going to require restoration work which Warner evidently (according to rumor) is doing. The studio went with the films that were in best condition and requiring the least amount of work to put out at this time. If the set sells well, it will justify the studio putting out more sets.

""The Mummy"" looks quite good--there's improved depth, detail and color captures the over saturated look common to these films from the 1950's and Jack Asher's colorful photography. Asher's shooting style was very imaginative with the use of colored lighting from unknown sources giving the films much more of a fantasy look to them (for example the green light that is cast over the tomb of the Princess in ""The Mummy"").

The audio sounds pretty good for the most part although there is some clear damage to the mono soundtrack audible during the last reel, it's not horrible and won't spoil your enjoyment of the film unless you are being picky.

We jump nine years into the future for the next film ""Dracula Has Risen From The Grave"". The script by John Elder (Anthony Hinds) is superior to ""DPOD"" although for me Lee still doesn't have enough screen time. . The fact is that ""Brides of Dracula"" (which has no Dracula in it because Christopher Lee wasn't interested and/or asked for too much money depending on which tale you hear) despite some problems with the screenplay (too many cooks messing with the script), was a strong sequel. ""DPOD"" was not as it lacked Cushing (although Keir is terrific in his role, I never bought a priest/marksman) and had characters doing stupid things for the convenience of the script. Likewise, ""Dracula Has Risen From The Grave"" benefits from a stronger script but again lacks a Cushing or Keir.

The transfer here is pretty good. Like ""The Mummy"" the bit rate hovers around 30 (important when it comes to making sure that you get nice looking high def transfers). This doesn't feature the over saturated look common to the 50's and early 60's (before 1963) when Asher was shooting the films. This is due more to a change in film stocks rather than the lighting but the more naturalistic and moody photography of Arthur Grant certainly fits this film. Director Freddie Francis insisted on using the colored gels which really gives this film something of a transitional look between Asher's work and Grant's.

""Taste The Blood of Dracula"" is next up and is the first script that makes the Fact that Dracula is a vampire less important to the film than a revenge plot. ""Grave"" features a charismatic (but limited) appearance by the late Ralph Bates and the script itself has some interesting twists although some of them are kind of illogical. The script was originally written with Bates in mind to replace Lee (much as he did in the reboot ""Horror of Frankenstein"" written and directed by Jimmy Sangster) in a different role as Dracula disciple Lord Courtley. Warner INSISTED that Lee be in the film and a hasty rewrite allowed Warner to get money from Warner to shoot the film. This is the first of many films where Dracula is more obsessed with revenge than increasing the size of his brood of vampires. As the series progressed Dracula would eventually turn in a variation of Fu Manchu.

A trio of businessmen have formed a secret society interested in tasting the seedy side of life. They become involved with Satanist Courtley who promises them even more extreme pleasures. During a ceremony to bring Dracula back, Courtley dies and Dracula, brought back to life, vows to avenge the death of his disciple by going after the men and their families.

It's an imaginative set up and well executed for the most part. Director Peter Sasdy does a nice job of staging most of the scenes and generates some good suspense early on. Lee doesn't have much to do and most of his involvement is in the second half of the film with dialog limited to counting off each victim of his revenge.

""Taste"" looks very nice and, like the other films, benefits from a NEW 2K transfer. Grain looks natural for the film and the colors are consistent and pretty strong. The bit rate hovers in the high 20's which is a refreshing change from what we've seen with many catalog titles.

Audio is quite good as well although there is noticeable hiss which is quite intrusive at times. I doubt that they could have removed this without damaging the quality of the sound as noise reduction can be a tricky thing to use.

""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" focuses on the Doctor (Peter Cushing) doing a brain transplant of a colleague named Dr. Brandt (George Pravda). It seems that Frankenstein needs information from his colleague who has now been confined to an asylum for the insane. Frankenstein blackmails the asylum physician (Simon Ward) to help him with his experiments.

Working with another script by producer Anthony Hinds (writing as John Elder), ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" is a strong entry in the series which, for the most part, didn't suffer from the problems of the Dracula films in terms of quality. Director Terence Fisher does a good job with the material. Except for one scene that was unnecessary (SPOILER ALERT--IT IS MENTIONED IN THE PARAGRAPHS BELOW) and added just before post-production at the insistence of Hammer, this is a fine film but it is also even more brutal and Frankenstein comes across as even more of a superior, smug sociopath than previously shown making him even more of the monster of the film.

As others have noted, the main drawback here is a lack of special features. All we get are the original theatrical trailers and, while they are welcome, it would have been nice to get commentary tracks from Hammer film scholars or the commentary tracks produced for previous editions of these films.

Overseas Lion's Gate has done a far better job with ""The Mummy"" for example including a 40 minute documentary, commentary track and other special features which befits a film from the classic period of the studio. Even the lesser films like ""Grave"" deserve better--a documentary on the troubled production (Terence Fisher was to direct but had to pull out at the last minute due to a car accident--Francis stepped in at the last minute and had some conflicts with Arthur Grant over the ""look"" of the film) or a continuing series of short featurettes on each film would have been welcome (for example, what about a featurette over the infamous rape scene in one film that was added to spice up the film and was done over the objection of the cast and director for the studio--Warner who didn't request it--in the belief it would help ""sell"" the film) and would provide some context for the film.

As mentioned, the transfers look very nice and, contrary to another review here, they feature new transfers nicely done. Audio is, except for a few brief instances, quite nice although the audio could have used a restoration.

If the studio had elected to provide special features, this would have made this an essential buy. As it is, these nice transfers make this worth the upgrade and the packaging of a nice hardbound ""book"" where the films slide out is also quite nice although I could imagine better use of the inside of the books with information on the production of the film or at least an essay.

I can recommend this based on the improved video but this is something of a missed opportunity for Warner most of these films have not been issued overseas yet on Blu-ray.",1444780800,21,9560,4.737221888153939
7283170,5,B00ZJYVK5G,"WARNER BROS. This is a learning process  for  the folks at DVD DRIVE IN and everybody that are saying remastering takes time and the blu ray set is not over priced. GUEST WHAT GUYS, the films are the old masters from when they came out 15 yrs ago on dvd . remember warner is not for the Hammer fans. Here is the proof, Dracula has risen from the grave in the forest scene when Carlson is following lee in the backround trees there is a slight frame film telecine jitter in the transfer process. Taste the Blood of Dracula still has the same minor scatches in the bordello scene. And Frankenstein must be destroyed the ending credits sound mix is off, sound fx is louder then the music score . The MUMMY music score stills sounds like is underwater. All was the same on  dvd 15 years ago. Now if they all new masters , the picture will looked rock steady looking  like a HD photo, and the audio is  well mixed and clearer. All warner did was put in a 1080 / 2k pc program process filter on the all the old masters so they come off looking smooth and having a smooth motion to the picture. You can get that look on any HD pc movie editing program. Warner is here to make money NOT to spend money on new masters. DVD DRIVE IN look again. By the way the blu ray set and single dvds is over priced. BY THE WAY,I have DIRECTV and last nite I was  scimin threw demand movies and they had DRACULA A.D.1972 in 1080 HD for 1.99 three day rental .

7283176,5,B00ZJYVK5G,"These are all completely uncut. While THE MUMMY and DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE were uncut in U.S. Theaters,
TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED were restored over a decade ago. All four movies are new transfers in full 1080p HD.
Having seen three of these in HD, with THE MUMMY having been released on Blu Ray by Hammer in the U.K., I can say that they look gorgeous.

The price breaks down to 12 dollars a movie. Probably less, if you hunt around. That's VERY reasonable for a new Blu ray release.

Warners would like to release THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA/HORROR OF DRACULA but CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN needs quite a bit of restoration and DRACULA, which was released restored in the U.K. needs a little more work as well. Probably Halloween of 2016, IF this set sells well enough.

As for putting them in order, that's not hard. Slip out the discs, slip them into a custom cover box. Problem sorted.

Warners owns all of the Dracula movies Hammer did except for DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS, which is out on Blu Ray,SCARS OF DRACULA, and THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN VAMPIRES
They only own 2 of the Frankenstein movies, the others spread between Universal, Sony/Columbia and Paramount. We'll have to bug Sony for THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN.

Despite no extras, this is very worthy set to get. And the only way any others are going to come out is if the fans support these releases.",1443744000,41,1424,4.590551181102362
7283177,5,B00ZJYVK5G,"I don't believe this is over-priced at all.  There is a cost associated with mastering, authoring, etc. and as much as I love these films they are not going to make up their investment in sheer volume of sales...hence the PERCEIVED high pricing.  Personally I think about $10 each for these films is a great deal.

Now on to the title selection...Hammer films are owned by many, various entities.  The most glaring omission from the Warner Brothers titles is ""Horror of Dracula"" which has been released in Great Britain in a version restored by the British Film Institute and then again with some scenes lengthened using a print discovered in Japan.  It would be pointless at this time for Warner Brothers to release the ""domestic"" version in the US using what are now outdated source materials.  Whether they have the rights to the new version or not is not known to me.

The rights to most of Hammer's remaining classic titles are owned by others...Universal and Columbia being among them.  According to an article by Diabolique Magazine the ""important"" Hammer titles owned by WB that are not in this set are ""Curse of Frankenstein"", ""Dracula A.D.1972"" and the aforementioned ""Horror of Dracula"" (aka ""Dracula"").

Now that I've hopefully cleared up why they aren't releasing ""collections"" of Dracula and Frankenstein box sets I'll say I am quite excited and pleased to see these four classics coming to Blu-ray format.  I consider them all important entries in the output of Hammer studios including ""Taste The Blood Of Dracula"" which will undoubtedly be presented on Blu-ray in it's uncut form like the DVD that precedes it.  If you feel it's overpriced I suggest waiting a while.  No doubt there will be an Amazon special and this will be in the $20 sometime before the end of the year.",1440720000,12,1790,4.832786885245902
