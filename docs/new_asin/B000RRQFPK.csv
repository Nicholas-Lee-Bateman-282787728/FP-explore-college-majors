8202414,5,B000RRQFPK,"I love this show. My 16-year old brother, my 8 year old niece and my 50 year old mom loved it. The show simply appeals to everyone of all ages. The messages are innocent, and the many hilarious shenanigans are still hilarious without the over-sexualization of the shows on the air. The girls introduce us to the fears and adventures normal kids go through in high school, but without the drama and boringness real high school has - saying good-bye to friends, realizing teachers are people too, and that everyone has a special talent. I'd recommend it for anyone.",1281312000,,563,4.696969696969697
8202415,4,B000RRQFPK,"I bought this a long time ago, and it is awesome.  I think we have watched it some 3-4 times because it is very repeatable.  The general story follows a set of girls through 3 years of school, and the antics that they pull on the teachers and each other.  Cute, good clean humor, great for watching with the wife or girlfriend.
My one complaint is that this particular version is definitely a cheap copy, and the encoding is rather blocky.  But as this isn't exactly a show for the visuals it is worth the cheaper price in spite of sacrificing some quality (win-7 windows media player seems to smooth it out better than most things we have watched it on).
Fun show, has an English voice cast that won't drive you insane, but also has the original Japanese with subs if you like reading.",1269820800,,786,4.4
