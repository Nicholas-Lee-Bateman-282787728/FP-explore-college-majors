8278013,5,B001AMRBRM,It was wonderful. I love it. The music is so good and the singing is first class. You can feel the spirit of God in that place.,1359417600,,127,3.740740740740741
8278014,5,B001AMRBRM,"There are praise and worship teams, and there are Praise and Worship Teams.  Gateway Worship goes beyond words.  It is a worship experience that is truly heavenly.  I love, love, love Gateway!! If  i lived anywhere near this worship team, i would be there at each and every worship experience.  They are the model for the ministry of music that ushers in the presence of God.  Thank you Gateway.  I will be forever grateful to you.",1356998400,,431,4.592105263157895
8278015,4,B001AMRBRM,"All of Gateway Worship's perfomances are great and it's clear they inspire their audiences. For me, however, Kari Jobe's rendition of Revelation Song is the most amazing part of the DVD. The song, written by Jennie Lee Riddle,  is beautiful in its simplicity. The lyrics are nearly verbatim exerpts from Revelations. You can see, as Kari sings, she is filled with the Spirit -- until she is literally over-flowing...it truly is a moving performance. That track alone is well worth the price of the DVD.",1274054400,2,502,4.905882352941177
8278016,5,B001AMRBRM,"I ran into these songs randomly on Youtube and was so excited to find the DVD.
Perfect as a gift, to keep at home, or play before services at your church.
Amazing band, beautifully assembled, and songs that you will listen to over and over again.",1258848000,,246,4.369565217391305
8278017,5,B001AMRBRM,"This has become my all time favorite worship CD/DVD. The music is heartfelt and mixed well. The talent and anointing on this team of people is evident throughout the worship experience. The DVD production is excellent and adds to the experience. I love to turn out the lights and allow the praise and worship to wash over me. Excellent Stuff!

8278018,5,B001AMRBRM,"First, thanks to Josh Blackmun for writing a review of this DVD which compelled me to buy it for myself.  It arrived less than a week ago, and I've watched it many, many times already!  Prior to getting the DVD, I had only seen ""Revelation Song"" on YouTube, and it quickly became my favorite song of all time!  I figured that even if that was the only good song on the DVD, it would be worth it.  But, to my GREAT astonishment, upon hearing ""Heaven's Song"" (the other bonus song on the DVD) it became my new favorite.  Seriously, this song was written in heaven.  Talk about being TRANSPORTED!!!  My other favorites are ""Alabaster Jar"" (which features an amazing chorus of ""Worthy, worthy, worthy is the Lord""), ""We Cry Out,"" ""Call Your Name,"" and ""Beautiful.""  However, there isn't a bad song on here--they're all top notch!!  Kari Jobe leads 4 songs, which are all amazing, and she is such an anointed worship leader.  I love the focus on the holiness and worthiness of God/Jesus the Lamb.  As much as I love Hillsong, this isn't a focus I've found in their music to this point, and I am hungry for it.  I just ordered the ""Facedown"" DVD because someone wrote that Matt Redman's songs have that same kind of worshipful focus.  Anyway, you will not be disappointed in Wake Up the World.  I think the experience is amplified in the DVD because of the visuals of these sold-out worship leaders.  So, even if you already have the CD (which doesn't have the two amazing bonus songs the DVD has), it is good to get the DVD, too!  There are great special features, such as audio commentaries by the writers of the songs (I rec'd a huge blessing listening to those!), and a short sermon by the Gateway church's head pastor, Robert Morris.  You really get a lot for your money with the DVD.  I can't wait until Gateway's next one comes out!",1228521600,9,1833,4.486404833836858
8278019,5,B001AMRBRM,"Regarding the DVD version (which has 2 bonus tracks)

I have been leading worship since 1999 and have been buying every significant new release on dvd and cd since - just to stay on top of trends and bring the latest and greatest to my congregation.  This is simply one of the best worship albums of all time.  There is some carry over here from CFNI albums 'Overtaken' and 'Glorious' (Christ For The Nations - [...] ) but that is a good thing.  Zach Neese, Kari Jobe, Walker Beach, etc....all amazing talent.  The church today would be a whole lot stronger if we were worshiping like these guys at gateway, and the DVD brings it all to life.

This album is on par with Hillsong's Mighty To Save, Jason Uptons's Faith, Matt Redman's Facedown, Christ Tomlin's See The Morning (Spec. Ed), David Crowder's Remedy, Passion (all of 'em) and so on...BUY IT.

Cheers, [...]",1224720000,6,866,4.584415584415584
8278020,5,B001AMRBRM,"I bought the CD of wake up the world, and loved every song, but with the DVD is a complete different worship experience. Get this DVD and you will be in the presence of God, your spirit will be drawn to worship, you will have a unique opportunity to worship with the Gateway team.
I love the DVD because you can see the authenticity  of this people while worshipping.
You will be blessed and get another copy to bless somebody else.",1215993600,2,432,4.333333333333333
