8199179,5,B000R7HY1O,My son loves these DVDs. They have really good messages in them as well. Their simplistic drawings really makes this stand out as unique from many of the rest of the cartoons you see on a regular basis.,1463443200,,202,4.342105263157895
8199180,5,B000R7HY1O,My 3 1/2 year old loves this show. What a unique group of characters with a lot of lessons to be learned! Highly recommended!,1327881600,,125,4.25
8199181,5,B000R7HY1O,"I was a little skeptical of ToddWorld from the cover art, expecting another poorly animated kids show.  That is not the case at all.  While it isn't an animation masterpiece, it is an engaging kids show with a great message.  The characters are unique and funny, and the stories share important messages about being an individual while being kind to one another.  It's a big hit in our house.",1242950400,,392,4.63768115942029
8199182,5,B000R7HY1O,We LOVE Todd Parr in our house!  We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old son & he loves it.  Our 8 year old enjoys it as well.,1239062400,,124,3.2413793103448274
8199183,3,B000R7HY1O,"The Volumes 1 and 2 are colorful, fun, with meaningful stories and my son loves them.  The reason I gave this 3 stars is that with all the attention to appreciating differences, episodes on sign language, and so on, I found it ironic that the DVD itself is not closed captioned for the hearing impaired (such as myself).  I also like to turn on the closed captions on movies because it helps my son with word recognition and with reading.",1205712000,3,438,4.4625
