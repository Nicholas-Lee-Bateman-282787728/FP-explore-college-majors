1192432,5,B0000065N7,"I've had this one for about 8 years and it is so worn out I was thrilled to see I could get a new copy from Amazon.com.  Now matter how many new videos I buy or gimmicks I try I always come back to this quick, VERY  effective workout.  The stomach and abs workout is the best I've seen  anywhere and the entire workout - from warm-up to cool down - is over in  less than 30 minutes.  CAN'T BE BEAT!",951955200,4,398,3.8518518518518516

1192434,5,B0000065N7,"This workout is great for someone who doesn't have a lot of spare time. Within 25 minutes, you warmup, work your legs, abs, arms, cool down. It's a basic, cut-to-the-chase workout, without the fluff.",917136000,,199,4.882352941176471

1192439,5,B0000065N7,"I love this tape, now I need the DVD. I've used this tape since 2003 and was upset when the tape was mishandled. But was happy to find it online. If you want to tone really quick and can only do low impact excerises, NO jumping around ! ....""This is a great tape""! I still use it today 2013.. Best tape ever!!",1358294400,,309,4.0

Yes it's old and in VHS and the model on the front isn't the instructor on the video.

Great overall workout, that's perfect for a life time of going back to!!!

I first got this VHS when I was in high school now I'm in my mid thirties",1229644800,,260,3.9615384615384617
1192442,5,B0000065N7,"This video has a great workout on it. It isn't extremely fast paced, gives good instructions and works the entire body. You will have to laugh at the old workout clothing styles though.",1220745600,,185,4.636363636363637
1192443,4,B0000065N7,"I bought this video because I really enjoyed Deborah Lee's other workout video, 29 Minute Beginners Workout.  This video is great too and has some of the same excercises, but is more focused on toning and sculpting.  It's a great compliment to use with the 29 Minute Beginners Workout or alone.  I wasn't a fan of the Cosmopolitan ""commercials"" sprinkled through the video and felt Deborah was a bit limited by this, whereas with her other video she was able to show more personality, but still remain professional, clear, concise, and encouraging.  All in all, good excercise video to pick up.",1216166400,,594,4.851485148514851
1192444,5,B0000065N7,Used this video about 10 years ago in high school.  The only one I could ever stick to and I loved the way it worked for me.  Just wore out the tape.  So very happy to find this video and again the only one I stick to.  Love it. Price was astonishing!!,1169337600,,252,3.7884615384615383
1192445,4,B0000065N7,This is a nice video that is not too long.  It focuses on all parts of the body so you get a nice overall workout and its fun to do.  The music and the setting are nice.,1166659200,,169,3.5405405405405403
1192446,5,B0000065N7,"This was the first workout tape I ever bought and used. I have used this tape off and on for the last 15 years. I still turn to this tape whenever I want a simple yet effective workout. It offers the option of adding hand weights to increase the aerobic benefits as well as add some more intensity to the upper body work. I also add ankle weights -- but you definitely don't have to in order get the benefits of this workout. This workout will grow with you as you move from beginner to intermediate exerciser. And, as far as the 80's production values go...that's just not that important to me; what is important is how I look and feel during and after doing a workout. This tape always makes me look and feel better. I have used this tape so much that I now need to replace it!",1129507200,3,779,4.2
1192447,5,B0000065N7,"I bought this video after reading the reviews here. It is a great workout. It's perfect for beginners, because she doesn't do a lot of reps (but they are effective!). I was sore the next day. It gives a good, complete workout in 30 minutes. Their outfits are really tacky, but I can look beyond that. As long as I'm getting in a good workout, it doesn't really matter what their wearing. I'm keeping this one.",1112659200,2,409,4.394736842105263
1192448,4,B0000065N7,"The first thing that you will notice about this video is how outdated it looks:  the instructor, Deborah Lee, is wearing bright blue with a wide headband; her four helpers are all in combinations of pink and green; and all five of them have ""big"" hair.  If you can get past appearances, however, you will find a classic toning workout focused mainly on the lower body.
The workout opens with a warmup which lasts just over 5 minutes.  Following this is about 8 minutes consisting mostly of traditional standing leg moves such as squats and lunges with a set of pushups thrown in.  Then it's to the floor for some quick abs work completed in about 3 minutes.  Next comes about 5 minutes of additional leg work (still on the floor) for the inner and outer thights, and finally, there is a short (3 minutes) cool down at the end.
Although this workout is quite short (more like 25 mintues rather than the 35 minutes stated on the box), it is intense, and your muscles will definitely ""feel the burn"" as they used to say at the time this tape was made (1988).  As an instructor, Deborah Lee is extremely straight-forward:  she displays each move with excellent form, but her instructions are minimal, and she does not chatter words of encouragement as so many instructors do.  No weights are used, making this tape a nice, simple workout for the time-crunched, space-crunched at-home exerciser.",1067817600,22,1390,4.691358024691358
1192449,4,B0000065N7,"this would be the first video i did all the way thru. it kinda reminds me of my old gym class warm ups. hard to do at first but you get the hang of it(reminder: i haven't done this kinda stuff in over 2 years). tho i wish they had more streching, so do your own before hand. i like how its simple. no goofy moves. hehe i had to laugh at the vid the first time i reviewed it, hey its fromm 1988 i can't help but make fun of the 80's :). music is not annoying.
i give it 4 stars mainly cause of lack of streching. im used to alot of streching from dancing school and gym class.",1064707200,2,575,3.760330578512397
1192450,5,B0000065N7,"I started using this video in 1990 after giving birth to my son, and got in the best shape I've ever been in. Ive used countless other workout videos since then, but this is my favorite.  I use it to tone, or as a warm up before a run.  Its simple, targeted exercises are the basics you need for a good toned body.  I lost my tape when we moved, and was so glad to find it on Amazon.",1048464000,2,383,3.8227848101265822
1192451,5,B0000065N7,"This exercise video is excellent for the busy woman.  The moves utilize the entire body within the short span of 30 minutes.  The spine is stretched to help relieve pinched nerves that cause leg and feet pain; a common problem for those who sit on the job or stress the lower back.  All joints are mobilized, tummies become flat and buttocks firmed.  I strongly recommend this for all ages.",1024790400,,390,4.608695652173913
1192452,5,B0000065N7,"I've already worn out two and am buying my third today. It always improves my posture and muscle tone no matter whether I use it once a week or every  day. I've been able to modify it through various health limitations and it has sustained my overall tone and helped support healing. The calm,  friendly teacher makes sure every muscle in your body is given a gentle stretch and light toning through yoga postures, ballet stretches, and a  challenging abdominal workout. It takes only 25 minutes and you feel great afterwards. Just do the 5-minute warm-up if you're in a hurry.
[NOTE: 9/29/10 Today I am buying my fourth copy. I'm still learning new things from this tape and, after 20 years, it still improves my posture and tone every time I use it.]",965088000,2,752,4.597014925373134
