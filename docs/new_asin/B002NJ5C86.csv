8375065,5,B002NJ5C86,Hilarious classic Taiwanese drama with Ariel Lin and Joe Cheng.  Great make-out scenes between the couple.  The scenes where she is learning to be a nurse are very funny.  This is one of my favorite dramas.,1493596800,,206,4.666666666666667
8375066,5,B002NJ5C86,"The quality of the discs were excellent. I was pleasantly surprised also with the quality of the English subtitles. They were on par with what Im used to seeing on DramaFever. . It Started With a Kiss/They Kiss Again is the Taiwanese version of the manga, Itazura na Kiss. Of the three version (Korean and Japanese are the other two), I think this one is without a doubt the best. Besides fully developing the main characters, the leads, Joe Chang (Jiang Zhi Shu) and Ariel Lin (Yuan Xiang Qin) has perfect onscreen chemistry. Joe is believable as a somewhat emotional detached genius and Ariel perfectly portrays the lovable, but somewhat dumb woman who loves him. Joes character comes across as cold in the beginning but without the stiffness of his counterparts in the Korean (Kim Hyun Joong) and Japanese (Yuki Furukawa) versions. While cold with outsiders, he is somewhat warm to his immediate family. He laughs, jokes and interacts with them, but yet still remains somewhat emotionally distant. In the Korean and Japanese versions, the main leads were stiff, their performance, wooden. The family interaction scenes felt forced rather than natural. Also in the Korean and Japanese versions, while both female leads (Jung So-min and Honoka Miki) were cute and adorable, their exaggerated facial expressions when daydreaming or emotionally frustrated, felt over the top. Ariel Lin was able to express her emotions without these facial contortions. Her silly grins in the mist of her daydreams were adorable and made you want to smile, while she showed her disappointment and frustration with simple yet effective facial and body language expressions that left you in no doubt as to her emotional state. I also liked the way that throughout the series, you see Jiang Zhi Shi slowly falling in love, but not realizing it. He hoards her gifts and gets angry when he thinks she is  seeing someone else. Its funny when hes told he is jealous when Yuan Xiang Qins classmate falls for her. You get to see his care, love and concern for her growing in They Kiss Again, until it finally matches the love she has for him. I would highly recommend the drama to anyone.",1431734400,3,2161,4.888283378746594
