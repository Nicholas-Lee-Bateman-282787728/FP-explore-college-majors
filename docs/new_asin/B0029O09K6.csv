8358027,1,B0029O09K6,"didn't realise that it was just the television show segment. I know the name should have given it away .... but was hoping for 60 minutes of an interview, not 15 minutes! oophs",1398729600,,176,4.363636363636363

8358030,5,B0029O09K6,I thought that the contents of this interview were very informative for the masses aswell as the fashion world.,1287100800,,111,4.894736842105263
8358031,5,B0029O09K6,"Everyone else is complaining about this DVD being short in length.  The running time of 12 minutes was listed in the item details, so I knew it was a small segment when I bought the DVD.  If Anna Wintour was constantly on TV and doing interviews, I would pass on this one, BUT she isn't.  I have always been intrigued with her fashion sense and wanted to have the segment for my collection.  It is rare that she grants interviews so this is really something to have.  I found it interesting, exactly what I would expect from Anna Wintour. Worth the price for it's rarity.",1255392000,10,571,4.4
8358032,1,B0029O09K6,"Anna Wintour is always interesting, but this DVD takes advantage of our interest. It is SHORT, and not worth spending your money on. WAY TOO MUCH MONEY for what you get. I'm not sure who should be more ashamed . . . amazon or 60 minutes. This DVD is a rip off!!

10/18/09 -- Since I first wrote this review, I found this entire segment could be downloaded from YouTube . . . not only for free, but of a much better quality than this DVD (the sound was horrible on my copy).",1254528000,23,473,4.086021505376344
8358033,1,B0029O09K6,"This DVD is a SCAM! It was virtually 15 to 20 minutes of documentary from 60 minutes! DO NOT WASTE MONEY to buy this! I feel so short changed! I can't believe I wasted all that money plus shipping to Singapore for this!!! DON""T BOTHER WITH THIS!",1254355200,12,245,4.23404255319149
