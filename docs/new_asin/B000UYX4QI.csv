8215719,5,B000UYX4QI,Very well done and enjoyable doc about the more notable midnight movies that are now cult classics. Can't say I was at all disappointed in the final product.,1440115200,,157,4.642857142857143
8215720,4,B000UYX4QI,"This documentary follows the concept of midnight movies, and how six in particular changed the way people viewed movies. This movie is important for horror fans, as three of the movies are genre efforts: Night of the Living Dead, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Eraserhead. I wish the doc was more in-depth because I still think there are a lot of places to visit when discussing midnight movies, but what we get is really well done. Lots of great interviewees and some excellent insight into the movies, their creation, reception and more. Its fascinating to learn how such iconic movies struggled and eventually became triumphant. At least in cult status. Great documentary.",1437523200,4,678,5.008849557522124

Nice to George Romero get his due.  And I still don't understand El Topo.",1375833600,,211,4.526315789473684
8215723,5,B000UYX4QI,Fascinating insight into the world of Waters etc. Much needed historical perspective too often lacking in our understanding of the genre.,1373760000,,137,5.571428571428571
8215724,5,B000UYX4QI,"I know it seems extreme to say but in all honesty I must. I am only fifteen and when I first watched this a few years ago I was introduced to 3 film makers who have come to be my favorites of all cinema. Most important of those I was introduced to David Lynch and y favorite film of all time ""Eraserhead,"" I know it may not affect you hardly this much but considering how deeply it affected me, I felt I must share",1230595200,15,414,3.9404761904761907
8215725,5,B000UYX4QI,"Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream pays tribute to an era of moviegoing that was unlike anything before or since.

The 1970s is generally regarded as the decade of the independent filmmaker. The studio system was breaking down, and more and more idealistic film students were breaking into the mainstream with unusual low budget productions. The films themselves weren't all that were changing, however. The seventies also brought about a new method of distribution for movies that would otherwise slip through the cracks. Midnight Movies covers this phenomenon by profiling six films that became cult hits during this time.

What do most of these films have in common? For the most part, they were made outside the system (with the exception of Rocky Horror). They also present subjects that were too off kilter to see during daylight hours, but with a strong sense of purpose. As filmmaker George Romero says in the movie, ""That's the secret to the success of some of these films. There's a focus and an intention and it doesn't lie to you.""

The films profiled are: El Topo (1970), Night of the Living Dead (1968), Pink Flamingos (1972), The Harder They Come (1972), The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), and Eraserhead (1977).

Midnight Movies concludes by touching briefly on the changes that brought on the end of the midnight distribution model. The mainstreaming of exploitation subjects (as in Jaws or similar blockbusters) and the advent of home video made midnight screenings unpopular and unnecessary. Audiences weren't supporting weird cinema anymore because they could get the same material in big budget movies or in the comfort of their own home.

8215726,5,B000UYX4QI,"A really good documentary about the Midnight Movies. They interview the filmmakers, the film critics, the theater owners and fans of movies that blossomed after dark. It's a beautiful appreciation of outcast cinema.

Films covered include El Topo, Night of the Living Dead, Freaks, Reefer Madness, The Harder They Come, Pink Flamingos and Eraserhead. If you enjoy any of these movies, do yourself a favor and watch ""Midnight Movies."" You might want to cover your rug in soda, popcorn, cigarette buts and other disgusting substances in order to give your home theater a true Midnight Movie feel. You might also want to have a few of those titles on hand to watch afterward.",1196812800,6,672,4.946902654867257
