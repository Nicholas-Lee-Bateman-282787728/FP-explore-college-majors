2125427,5,B0002VF5VG,"I was just about to pre-order this DVD when I noticed the new release date is JANUARY 2010!!!

Are you kidding me?",1112572800,,114,4.181818181818182
2125428,5,B0002VF5VG,"It figures.  With all the recent DVD's released by Yes, all of which are somewhat unexciting and released promptly, they have to keep pushing back the release date of one of the most hotly anticipated ones.

This is hands down the best Yes concert I've ever seen.  Mainly, the fact that the order and song choice were not the most predictable.

They've been pulling some serious punches with their setlists over the last 15 years, either resorting to predictable ""greatest hits"" sets or completely wild sets like the one displayed at the Masterworks show.  This one was a perfect mixture of the shorts and the longs, and features one that I NEVER thought would see the light of day onstage, which is the stunning, recent (1996) epic  piece ""Mind Drive"" which I love just as much as the classic material.  Here, it is bookended by South Side Of The Sky and Turn Of The Century, and just when you thought they had abandoned Mind Drive altogether they come around and blast you with its stunning finale.

It was also incredible that they had managed to pull out a couple from the first two albums which they haven't done in quite some time.  The one-two-three punch of the openers was the best I had ever seen them open with.

The band were in fine form and although the Roger Dean stage was most definately on a budget it was the most visually pleasing Yes stage I got to witness in person.

The vibe at the show was amazing (never seen a Philly Yes show and it won't be my last now that I'm a resident) and I can't wait to see the DVD.  I know it will be good.

Will they f*uckin' put it out already!??!?!?!?!!?",1111881600,12,1610,4.416949152542373
2125429,5,B0002VF5VG,"I pre-ordered this in January and I am pretty sure there was a release date shown at that time.  The Yes website [...] shows a date of April 12.  The Image Entertainment website [...] shows the release scheduled for June 21.

I saw this concert twice and can't wait for the DVD.  I too own all of the Yes DVDs.  I sure hope there is no last minute delay.",1111708800,2,354,4.072463768115942
2125430,1,B0002VF5VG,"I like YES so much.
I have many YES dvd's like..
Symphonic Live, Q.P.R Vol1,2, House of YES
Yes speaks, Yes years, Yes Acoustic
Keys to Ascension...

And I have been waiting this dvd since 2004.
But, still no release date announced...
For more, they changed release date 2~3 times.

In my opinion, release date is a kind of promise to YES fans.
So, I give 1 star for this dvd.
For sure, I will buy this dvd and give stars again.

Please..Release..",1110412800,2,447,4.36144578313253
2125431,5,B0002VF5VG,"There was a time when Yes seemed to have forgotten their classical songs. Every time I bought a DVD, I knew I would have to sit through ""And you and I"" and ""I've seen good people"" again. I love these songs believe me. But on every DVD, there would be only two or three new classical songs. Now they seem to be understanding that they have to go back to those songs which made Yes one of the best Rock groups ever. We've been throght the 80's and the 90's and when we look back we see nothing of great impact has been done in terms of Rock. We had ""The Police"", Maybe ""U2"", but good, intelligent, pop and creative music mixed up with quality and great musicians has not been found. Of course, we had King Crimson. The reason why I did not mention this other great band was just because I find Yes more popular. Maybe I'm wrong. But the thing is that Yes looked back and probably they had it figured out , ""My God! The songs we composed in the past were one of the best things made in terms of rock music ever."" Let's go back to it and sell, make money, have fun..."" And I would say they are right. I admit and hope millions of Yes fans agree with me : They still have some old rarities left : Sound Chaser, To be Over (Steve Howe; instrumental); Dear Faher; Don't Kill the Whale; Parallells and maybe some more. Every time I saw a Yes DVD I wondered, ""Where's ""South Side of the Sky"" ? It was released in ""Acoustic"" and it is relealed again now. Thank God. I just hope that they do not keep releasing the same songs over and over. I agree that some songs are worth listening to a new version. I'm a little tired of seeing good people, but what Yes did now I take my hats off. Congratulations. As I always end a Yes review : Remember, Yes. Not only rock fans like Yes, but also musicians.",1109808000,6,1786,4.1203438395415475
2125432,5,B0002VF5VG,"Finally a great video with the full classic line-up that we all love. The set list is nothing short of spectacular if you like a good show this is it. I think all the people that saw them live agree. A good followup to yessymphonic, In an objective world this would be a major hit. In real world let's hope so! It's about time!

So buy more and give them to your friends and spread the joy!",1109116800,8,390,4.064935064935065
2125433,5,B0002VF5VG,"I was at this show and I can attest to the fact that is was Yes at their finest. They are every bit as good 35 years into it as they were at the beginning. The short acoustic set they did in the middle of the show was great and highlighted their musical abilities. Jon Anderson's voice still sounds like it did in the early days. I hope they will be around a few years more (many more I hope). I can't wait for the DVD to get here. If its half as good as the other DVDs Yes has done in the last few years, it should be a treat!",1101772800,9,527,3.7567567567567566
2125464,5,B0002VF5VG,"I am a yes fan, and have been all my life. This concert is a wonderful experience with the original members of Yes. When I ordered it I did not know that it was shipping from the U.K. and was actually in the European DVD format. I was set to return this when, lo and behold, I found that my MacBook pro will play any DVD. It asked what region I wished to reset to and we were off! I was overjoyed at this due to the fact that I actually could not find this concert in the U.S. DVD region anywhere! If you are a Yes fan, this is an amazing concert, opening with an acoustic set.",1403827200,,577,3.8983050847457625

2125466,1,B0002VF5VG,"the dvd they sent did not work on my Samsung dvd player.  the message came up that it was ""foreign version"" and could not be viewed!  that's pretty sad!  I'm still waiting for them to refund me. it's coming up on two weeks since I returned it asking for a refund.  very unhappy at this point, I love the band, and love the video as I saw it on TV once.  I hope they take care of it and do something so others don't get a foreign copy.",1396742400,,434,3.8863636363636362
2125467,3,B0002VF5VG,"The video and audio were excellent.  I watched it on my 8.9HDX and almost felt like I was there.  You should consider a couple points before you buy this video.  First, are you expecting Yes in their prime?  I was, which resulted in me being a little disappointed.  Not to discount their performance; Yes will always be a good band regardless of whether or not they play their 'hits', but I would have preferred more of their more popular songs.  Second, what is it worth to you, to see Rick Wakeman on the keyboards.  Other than the fact that his facial expressions seemed to indicate he wanted to be somewhere else, he's still at the top of his game when it comes to the keyboards.  To watch someone, who's worked so hard, to be so good; that alone made the video worth it to me.  His performance takes nothing away from the band.  The vocals and guitar work were top notch too.  Individually, each member of the band works harder than most other band members.  Collectively, they could sing or play anything and I'd listen to it.  They earn their money.  I think if you appreciate a band that really works hard to put on a good performance, you'll like this video.",1393891200,2,1167,4.443396226415095
2125468,5,B0002VF5VG,"Great concert with everyone really enjoying themselves.

2125470,5,B0002VF5VG,"This is a good concert, but make sure you buy the region 1 version for US customers. It is hard to tell unless you are really researching this purchase. All the new ones seem to be Region 2/3/4. You have to buy used for Region 1, unless you want to pay twice as much for the new version of US Region 1.",1388188800,,302,3.8870967741935485
2125471,1,B0002VF5VG,The band and the music is awesome. This rental is poor sound quality. Which is why you would rent a selection like this in the first place.,1384646400,,139,4.185185185185185
2125472,5,B0002VF5VG,They sounded just like the old days. Great band and great singer. Helps us remember the good ole' days. Thanks for the memories.,1372636800,,128,4.608695652173913
2125473,3,B0002VF5VG,"So I have to start by admitting that I had the privilege of seeing the classical Yes line up twice.  They blew me away and I can still remember that so very many years later.  Yes Jon still has a fantastic voice (especially for his advanced years) and all of the musicians have continued to hone their skills but it just was missing some of the rawness that made them so much more alive back then.  Maybe the video is too glitz for me but I'd much rather see this lineup live in a small venue.  My wife walked out of the room and went to bed about a third of the way through it saying ""I'd rather remember them from the old days""

That said, it is yes, it is the classical lineup, they were some of the forerunners of Prog and they  can still work it.  If you have never seen Yes, give it a try.  IF you have seen them live - don't bother pauing for this - save the three bucks for the next time Chris brings his current version to a town near you",1370044800,,947,3.9735449735449735

2125494,5,B0002VF5VG,There are few tracks where Chris Squire uses a bass pedal - if you have a decent sound system your subwoofer is going to try to do subsonic things. Utterly amazing. Sound track was very well recorded as was the filming (location = Boston). Jon Anderson's vocals are sharp and Rick Wakeman shines on the keyboards. You won't be disappointed!,1364688000,,340,4.683333333333334
2125495,5,B0002VF5VG,"This may be the last time these old guys can muster the energy to do this nearly three hour program.  The acoustic section was a treat and the history-spanning song selection was spot on.

2125496,3,B0002VF5VG,"Songs from Tsongas is my only YES concert DVD in my collection presently.

And yes, I do count myself a YES fan...maybe not the biggest or the most knowledgeable, but a fan nonetheless.

I watched this video again last night, probably the third or fourth time since buying it late last year. My initial impression of the concert footage was, Wow. This (YES) is a body of work that represents the best music that ever was birthed by prog rock in my opinion. I sat and watched this concert in amazement, impressed that despite the years that have passed (nearly 30 years) since Yes' first album, these guys still got it. At least, 3/4 of the way through the concert, they still got it.

There are a host of reviews here that can give you a song-by-song review; this is not one of them. Rather than re-hash what others have likely written before me, I wanted to focus more on the production quality, artistry & musicianship, and the like.

The production quality of the disc is generally very good. Camera angles capture all the right moments, zooming in on soloists or panning the crowd's reaction to high points in the music being performed. Audio quality is decent, but not great; I tried the different Audio options (Dolby Stereo, Dolby 5.1, and DTS) and decided Dolby 5.1 sounded best on my system. Compared to another concert DVD in my collection, the audio quality is not as crisp as the Toto: Falling in Between Live disc on Blu-ray. Minor point, but take half a star off the 5 you start with...now, this might improve if the concert is re-released on Blu-ray, perhaps, but that still might not tweak it enough for my ears.

Musically speaking, the performances by the musicians were top-notch. Steve Howe could give a clinic on how to play the guitar (and other stringed instruments - electric, 6-string acoustic, lap steel, dobro, 12-string acoustic, dual-neck 6- & 12-string electric, Portuquese guitar) from this DVD alone. Rick Wakeman...man, this guy's got all kinds of keyboards surrounding him; knowing how layered the Yes sound is, it's hard to believe how he makes it look so easy to reach from his Mini-Moog to his Korg Triton, changing tones, bending notes, all the while keeping time, like a wizard plays his fingers over spellbooks. Especially fabulous to me is how all the musicians blend and flow with each solo played.

Yes fans probably know their discography well enough to know the songs simply by hearing the first notes or chords struck, but the DVD also features the song title as the band begins to play each song. Nice touch, but like I said, likely unnecessary for Yes fans. Quite helpful, however, for those new to Yes who may not be able to determine where one song ends and the next begins. Concert is divided into two DVDs, but the intermission comes before the first DVD's content capacity ends. This leads to an odd feeling when going from the full stage set -> acoustic set -> Steve Howe solo (""Second Initial"") -> end of the acoustic set, because you never get that ""pause"" where you can get up and head for some snacks before playing the next DVD. I love the two basses that Squire plays throughout...the green demon and that classic Ricky...and for an old guy, Alan White's rhythms never miss a beat, and that says a lot for a musician who has to keep time for an entire band that creates polyrhythmic compositions. With that being said, I must deduct another half a star from the 5-point total because of the disjointed intermission/DVD split.

This leads me to my last star deduction: most bands, and Yes is no exception, throw in an acoustic set to change things up (plus, it gives some of the guys in the band a much-needed breather). Most of the times, an acoustic set is welcomed by fans because it gives a new wrinkle to an old tune now and then. Most of the songs in the acoustic set in this DVD were rather well done, especially giving Roundabout a more boogie-woogie feel to the rhythm section. I liked just about every song they did in this set, up until they began playing, first, ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"", which I thought was poorly done - the studio version, with the amount of layering that had to be done to capture all the background vocals, instrumentals, etc. is far superior - and this live version doesn't even come close. When I heard the first notes ""Rhythm of Love"" begin, I could just feel it in my soul that this was NOT going to appeal to me. I had an even harder time just staying with the song long enough to get through it to watch the rest of the DVD. This is one of the YES songs that I absolutely love, and love to turn up the volume to as high as my ears can stand it. If I didn't like the rendition of ""Owner"", I absolutely HATED this version of ""Rhythm"".

Sadly, those are the only two songs I didn't enjoy from the acoustic set that I really was looking forward to on this DVD. To my delight, however, the other songs in the acoustic set were, in the only way I can describe it, delicious. A veritable treat for the auditory senses...Starting with track one of Disc 2 (""The Meeting""), and straight through to ""Show Me"", the depth of concept matter lyrically and musically lead the listener on fantastic journey of sound and imagination.

Jon Anderson comes back out after Howe's killer acoustic solo, wearing a wild-looking sport coat (as if a wardrobe change was required?), and sounds like he is so out of breath by this point that sounds like he's singing the lyrics half-heartedly as if to say, ""Are we done yet?"". Keyboards sound cheesy (synth brass doesn't quite cut it), bass line is lazy, and the drums - well, Alan White does his best to keep the pace going but he's fighting a losing battle. Howe's guitars on this song don't sound as meaty and crunchy as the studio version. A big sigh. I guess they're showing their age at this point in the concert, as the remaining songs are a bit lackluster despite the grandiose compositions that close out the set - And You and I, Ritual, Every Little Thing, and Starship Trooper.

Overall - three out of five stars.

Recommendation - Despite the average rating I gave this DVD set, this concert features music never before performed on stage by Yes (Mind Drive) from their 1996 album Keys to Ascension, and is therefore Highly recommended. Plus one star for this fact alone, although my final rating will not reflect this.

NOTE - I was fortunate enough to see Yes perform last summer (2011) at the Chateau St. Michele Summer Concert Series (I did buy the t-shirt, thank you very much) in support of their latest release, Fly From Here. Much of the material played that night were fan-favorites, with a number of tracks from the new CD which was released a month later in July. Benoit David did a superb job filling Jon's shoes, at times almost sounding exactly like Jon. One knock on Benoit - man, if you're ever on stage again and the composition does not have a part for you, PLEASE DON'T JUST SIT DOWN ON STAGE like a spectator - you looked amateurish, and lacking stage presence when you did that, sir. Also - Yes is not the Beach Boys, so Hawaiian shirts are a NO-GO for you. Tie-dye is appropriate, however.",1338940800,,7144,4.550972762645914
2125497,5,B0002VF5VG,"This was an absolute mind blowing experience.  At clocking in at nearly 3 hours Yes leaves nothing off the table.  This concerts biggest strength was the fact that Yes chose to do 90 percent of the music from thier golden 70s era.  These old duffers play and sing thier hearts out.  They are genuinly having a great time and it shows.  They perform in a Roger Dean inspired setting adding to the awesome mood of their greatest songs.  Obvious highlights are the extended jam of South Side Of The Sky, Howes guitar solo on Yours Is No Disgrace, and the pummeling workout on the epic track Starship Trooper. If you are a Yes fan do not hesitate to pick up this outstanding concert.",1327190400,,679,4.479674796747967
2125498,5,B0002VF5VG,"On Saturday May 15th 2004, Yes played the first of two shows at the Tsongas Arena which was taped by PBS' Soundstage. Since people have brought up sound quality as an issue, let's get that out of the way. Soundstage is PBS show in which most artists are brought into a studio environment (sound stage) with a very small amount of gear and play before a few hundred people (it's sort of like Unplugged but with electric instruments). The Yes Acoustic dvd is the perfect example of this as it was recorded on a sound stage in L.A.. This concert was NOT recorded on a sound stage but in a real concert hall in front of 8,000 people with the Soundstage crew trying to get what the band sounded like in the arena that night. This is not recorded straight from onstage mics, a mixing board or a multi track recording which allows for fixing it in the mix later on. The sound on here is not bad by any means but there are a couple of spots where there's a bit of echo and the like. This is a high definition recording of what Yes sounded like in the arena on this night.

The show opens with a recording of Firebird Suite while the band assemble on the stage. Going For The One opens the show and this is the only part of the dvd where the sound is below par as the Yes crew try to get the sound dialed in. The second song is Sweet Dreams and it is played perfectly and the sound is clearly dialed in from the get go. I've Seen All Good People is well performed although Steve's guitar at the beginning could be a little louder but isn't that usually always the case. People are divided on Mind Drive but I love it and here it's first two parts drop us into a rocking South Side Of The Sky. Turn Of The Century is a wonderful performance. The cool My Eyes section of Footprints leads us into the final part of Mind Drive. The first set is wrapped up with a nice version of Yours Is No Disgrace. There's also a nice interview with Roger Dean in here too.

The second half of the show opens with a Rick Wakeman solo, The Meeting Room, with Jon then coming out to join him on The Meeting. Then, the the rest of the band appears for a short stunning acoustic set featuring Long Distance Runaround, Wonderous Stories, Time Is Time, Roundabout, Show Me and Owner Of A Lonely Heart. I also like the fact that there's a bit of talking between the band members and to the audience during this short part of the show. Everyone seems in very good spirits. The second electric half resumes with Rhythm Of Love and the mix is a little harsh here but improves for the remainder of the show. And You And I is flawless while Ritual is a wonderful massive treat! For the enocores, we get a wonderful version of the rare Every Little Thing She Does dating all the way back to the band's beginning. Starship Trooper is a cool way to end the show.",1319846400,4,2820,4.220370370370371
2125499,5,B0002VF5VG,"I've been a Yes fan for over 20 years, and have often lamented the fact that I rarely got to see them in their prime (except for the Masterworks tour).  However, thanks to the Yes gods for answering the call of us latecomers and creating/releasing a truly amazing show.  The material is great, the talent shines, and there are some of those moments that just bring tears to your eyes.  The interview with Roger Dean is a nice foray into the thought behind the iconic images that we associate with the band, and it's great fun to see Jon and the rest rockin' out and having a fantastic time.",1316476800,3,590,4.394495412844036

Unfortunately, this file they're selling for $9.99 only contains the first half of the show! As the file is ending you can even hear the announcer telling the crowd that there will be a 15 minute intermission before the next set...What a letdown. There's a really cool part of this concert where the band does more acoustic versions of Owner of a Lonely Heart and Roundabout, and they're not included in this download. So do yourself a favor and order the DVD. You won't regret it!",1260316800,,622,4.417391304347826
2125502,5,B0002VF5VG,"Since I have been watching Yessongs for 20+ years, the aging factor messed with my head, but they sounded great.  Wish I had been at that concert - They ""jazzed up"" Roundabout and it sounds even better. Not as energetic and ""raw"" as they were back in '74, but the maturity has made them tighter. Both 35th anniversary DVDs are a pleasure to watch and listen to. In fact, I think I'll watch it again today...",1257724800,2,407,4.355263157894737
2125514,4,B0002VF5VG,"I saw Yes during this tour in Michigan at The Palace Of Auburn Hills and it looked just like this video concert.  I loved the stage design (70's style like Yes should always look on stage) and this is a great keepsake for me.  Correct me if I am wrong but this was filmed for the PBS program ""Soundstage"" and you can tell that it is a first rate production in terms of the camera work.  Either they had a ton of cameras or they did their homework because the timing is great.
I think all Yes concerts should be staged this way because Yes are bigger than life and they deserve it.  Any music lover would enjoy this and of course it is a must for any Yes fan.
I wonder if Jon will ever get back with them for one more monster tour (hopefully with a new album with classic Yes music to bring them back on top again.
Jon said he was working on new stuff so you never know.",1257292800,,869,4.005780346820809
2125515,2,B0002VF5VG,"Don't understand how folks can say this is so good.  Besides Anderson being mixed way to high (which can be annoying - always looked at his voice as another instrument -  to be blended in with everything else) -  the rest of the mix is very mushy.  One of those 'you can hear everything -  but you can't hear anything'  mixes.  Drums almost non-existant.

The performance is good. But if you want a really great sounding live performance of YES -  the live at Montreaux DVD is it. Other than the fact that the for the first half of the show the camera never focuses on Squire (weird) the sound is almost flawless.  The drums sound particularly good in Montreaux -  and overall, it's all good -  way better than Tsongas.",1250121600,4,719,4.404580152671755
2125516,4,B0002VF5VG,"I love this this music and the people who play it more than I know how to say, so I feel I owe them, and all longtime fans, full honesty in my review.

A magical set with gorgeous lighting, great technical production, some preciously seldom-performed songs, and a charming acoustic set, are the highlights of this DVD set.  In particular, the acoustic blues treatment of Roundabout was a stroke of genius, almost self-deprecating in a gentle sort of way, reminding me of The Who's My Generation Blues from The Kids are Alright.

I found myself brought to tears of nostalgia at moments, although there was a little sadness behind those tears as well, as each time out Yes performances, and Jon's voice, get a little more raggedy and inconsistent. The only player consistently in top form in these latter years is Alan White, as lately even Steve and Rick have to drop notes to keep up the pace.

To be completely honest, I haven't heard a live Yes show that is brilliant and vital from end to end since the ABWH and Union tours of 1989-1992.

I feel many of the positive reviews of recent Yes DVDs to be written by fans so glad the band is still playing, they are not frank about the rough edges and sometimes lackluster performances.  There is nothing wrong with finding these less-than-best performances enjoyable and worth buying. I do not regret my own purchase, but in the future will take some of these effusive reviews with more than a few grains of salt.

I, too, am glad the band is still playing from time to time, and in particular find parts of the earlier Symphonic Live DVD to be performances as essential as anything they have ever done before.

So, with some trepidation, I will lend some trust one more time to the enthusiasm of my fellow fans and go ahead and order the 2003 Montreux show, hoping that it captured one of those good nights, or at least has enough post-production cheats to cover the blemishes and fill the gaps.",1244332800,3,1944,4.566091954022989
2125517,4,B0002VF5VG,"This was the last concert of Yes's 35th anniversary tour in 2004, featuring the ""classic"" Yes lineup. As befits such an event, the concert is largely a nostalgia exercise with Yes performing a sampling of their brilliant music from each decade starting in the 60s right up to the present decade. The performance of ""Ritual"" is especially striking. Definitely a must for Yes fans. Others may prefer the more serious and focused Live at Montreux concert DVD from 2003.",1218326400,,466,4.9113924050632916

Having said that, this video could have been great but is absolutely horrible in one key area; the picture editing. The video's picture jumps from view, to view, to view rarely spending more than two or three seconds on any one camera. I get dizzy watching it. Good grief, I want to watch these incredible musicians play their instruments. It's as though the editor was either overzealous or had a very short attention span.",1211068800,2,511,4.752808988764045
2125520,3,B0002VF5VG,"I've been a Yes fan since I bought their first album in 1969, and it's heartening to see these guys still playing this wonderful music. This video is well staged and well shot, and the band plays and sings exceptionally well, even if Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman appear to be bored (appearance only; their playing certainly is sharp). Unfortunately, the whole thing is let down by some of the worst sound I've ever heard in a live performance. The whole thing is mud--compressed, confused, and cloudy. Individual parts occasionally stick out from the murk, but only just. An example: Alan White, in addition to his drumset, is surrounded by giant bulbous drums that appear to be designed by Roger Dean, used only in the intro to Sweet Dreams. At that point there is no one else playing, just White, and all of those big drums are being played by remote beaters. Presumably it sounded impressive in person, but here there is no hint of any sound coming from those drums. It's a completely mystery how the sound mixer could screw that up--there was no other instrument to balance it against! This music is complex, with lots of interlocking parts, and each of the players is usually playing something unusual, so it's all the more important that the sound be clear and clean, and all the more disappointing to find it so muddy. Note to sound man: Yours IS a Disgrace.

The DVD is still worth owning, though, for the visuals, which actually help you interpret what people are playing, like reading lips.",1203120000,3,1499,4.699619771863118
2125521,5,B0002VF5VG,"Yes can still enlighten us with their idealistic nature while electrifying fans and listeners alike with their musical craft. The first half of this show has the band rocking out with power jams, especially on great classics like ""South Side Of The Sky,"" and ""Your Is No Disgrace."" The second half contains some extended plays too, and Wakeman's keyboard craft is still very distinguished, but the band offers a different spin on some of their classics with a slower, acoustic-like play on ""Roundabout,"" and ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart,"" and they pull it off. As a major musical force that helped to exemplify progressive rock back in the 70's, Yes are a classic but everlasting presence as they celebrate their love and ritual of music within the 21st century.",1200700800,2,758,4.883720930232558
2125522,5,B0002VF5VG,"This DVD is really great.  South Side of the Sky and Ritual are both standouts and GREAT.

I was a bit disappointed in the guitar work on Starship Troopers and Yours is No Disgrace. I think I miss Steve's way out riffs on Yessongs. But otherwise Steve Howe was amazing.

Even Mind Drive performed twice on this DVD was really good and it is not one of my favorite Yes tunes.

If you like Yes you won't be disappointed.

UPDATE: I note that a lot of people are commenting on the sound. I suppose that would depend upon what system you are listening to this DVD on. I just had it hooked up to my old stereo and it sounded GREAT. So good in fact that I ripped it to my MP3 player where the tracks are among the best sounding of 10 or 15 gigs I have of live music of all kinds!

That being said I don't think there is any sound system anywhere that is going to be able to play the drum sections and sound like Yes in concert. Music systems are not capable of that, nor are mixers able to capture that full dynamic range.",1199664000,2,1016,4.055
2125523,5,B0002VF5VG,"I'm very surprised that some of the reviewers don't like this DVD.  The performances are absolutely amazing.  Some reviewers have stated that Anderson is in the spotlight the whole time and the band members aren't given any time to show off their capabilities.  I don't see that at all except maybe on the beginning of Rhythm of Love when Anderson goes into the audience.  Okay, that's part of one song.  And maybe the acoustic set turned out to be a disappointment for some but I don't see it as a disappointment at all.  I think this DVD is absolutely spectacular.  The performances of South Side Of The Sky, Starship Trooper, Yours Is No Disgrace, You're Move/I've Seen All Good People, Ritual, And You And I, Turn Of The Century, Sweet Dreams, Mind Drive, and even their version of Every Little Thing are all amazing.  Even the acoustic set is incredible.  It shows how brilliant a band really is if they could successfully play some of their songs acoustically.  They do a fantastic job with Long Distance Runaroud, Wonderous Stories, The Meeting, Owner Of A Lonely Heart, Time Is Time, Show Me, and Steve Howe's performance of Second Initial.  Even Roundabout works quite well acoustically.  The camera work is also very good and you get plently of shots of the band members.  Howe (my favorite member) is such an incredible guitarist and you get to see how brilliant he is on electric, acoustic, lap steel, and that other guitar that he uses on Your Move and Wonderous Stories.  You also get to see and hear how Wakeman is a keyboard wizard and is one of the best keyboardists ever.  He does a great job on his regular keyboards during the regular parts of the set and is also brilliant on the piano during the acoustic set.  One great thing about this DVD that is a problem with Yes Live at Montreaux (which is still fantastic) is that you get to see a lot more of Squire.  Not only is Squire a fantastic bassist and backing singer, but he is also the only founding member of Yes who has never left the band.  You get to see and hear how great of a bass player Squire is and how important his backing vocals are.  Some Yes fans seem to prefer Bruford on drums over White, but White is just as good as Bruford ever was.  Plus, it shows that White has been in the band a lot longer than Bruford was so it obviously has worked better with White.  Remember, White was once played drums for John Lennon, and there is no way that Lennon would have allowed White to drum for him if he wasn't any good.  White is an amazing drummer and his drums on South of the Sky alone justify his importance to the band.  Anderson has an amazing voice and it's fantastic that he still can sing as high as he can.  As a band, their playing is just as good, if not better, as it was years ago and you definitely get to witness the virtuosic musicianship of all the band members (especially Howe, Squire, and Wakeman).  This is a fantastic DVD and I strongly recommend it.",1190851200,2,2956,4.42962962962963

As for Yes themselves, one of the interesting thing with this band as they age is how they hone the material.  You rarely see them play a song the same way twice, which is a good thing.

Let's all hope they can get their act together to actually record & tour again in the next year or two.  In the meantime, check out the new Yes-related band Circa, featuring Billy Sherwood, Alan White, Tony Kaye, & Jimmy Iovine!",1188691200,2,674,4.309523809523809

I agree with his sentiments, but his smug goody-two-shoes guru of PEACE! LOVE! HAPPINESS! demeanor is purely peurile.  It's excusable when not excessive and the band is crankin' -- but here it seems Messrs. Wakeman, Howe, Squire & White are mainly window dressing for the highly enlightened, inspiring, mercurial Jon Anderson.  I've seen Yes at least a half dozen times from '75 on.  This represents the band at a nadir; perhaps they're just too old and creaky to blast off like they used to.",1186358400,5,650,4.881818181818182

Every time you think they are going to explode into some kind of cathartic jam, you strain to hear Steve and Rick.  Jon Anderson destroyed this band a number of times thinking that these musicians were back-up to his vocals.

Do yourself a favor and buy the ""YesSongs"" DVD.  When they play the intro to ""Close To The Edge"", you will know why you became a Yes fan so many years ago: 5 exceptional musicians sharing the stage to explode into orbit.  This latest fiasco is a one man show, dressed up like Yes.

2125541,4,B0002VF5VG,"This is a great double DVD of Yes performing live in 2004.  The stage was definitely designed from a larger budget and represented the fantasy that Roger Dean created as the artist that reflects all that you know about Yes and their album covers and all the artwork associated with Yes.

Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Alan White, Steve Howe, and Rick Wakeman are all here performing at their very best.  I'm not too familiar with several of these songs on this performance but that's okay because I've already got much of my favorite performances from them on the ""Keys to Ascension"" DVD.  And there is a much better interaction with the audience on this performance.  You know, it's funny.  Sometimes, Jon Anderson sounds like Bjork.

The best thing about this DVD is the quality.  This performance was filmed in High Definition.  Widescreen and 5.1 Surround Sound.  This is probably the last big-budget performance that you will ever see from Yes.

But, of course, I could be wrong.  Some groups do have an amazing way of staying alive.  Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, and The Moody Blues seem to continue to perform and they are up there in their years too.  It all remains to be seen.",1168819200,5,1182,4.702439024390244

2125544,5,B0002VF5VG,"This DVD is an extraordinary masterpiece, exemplary of the Yes phenomenon that has captured the progressive rock world for the last 37 years. The classic lineup of Jon Anderson, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White returns in this live performance recorded in Boston, MA in 2004.

Performing on a stage designed by Roger Dean (who has also created much of the artwork on Yes album covers), Yes traverses from classic stage setup to a special ""unplugged"" set, back to the original. This versatility and prowess demonstrates why Yes is one of the few bands that doesn't need ""bells and whistles"" onstage and instead, relies on the sheer virtuosity of their craft. The band's odd time-signatures, flowing bass lines and lightning-fast guitar riffs are accompanied by Rick Wakeman's legendary performance on keyboards; Wakeman is no less than mesmerizing. Together, they are anchored by Alan White, who provides a solid and flawless backing on drums/percussion.

While the band members may have aged chronologically, they are still as tight-knit a group musically as they were when they originally created this music. One can simply close one's eyes while watching this and not be able to tell the difference between the music emanating from the DVD and the Yes of ""yesterday"". Jon Anderson's vocal performance is stellar and he is one of the few lead vocalists that has not lost his ability to reach the higher end of the spectrum. Of noteworthy mention is the backing vocal section of Chris Squire and Steve Howe; it is this unique harmonic unity that has kept Yes at a rare forefront for the past 37 years.

Overall, the video and sound quality are excellent. I recommend watching this in 5.1, as the ""live"" performance will be definitely be more robust.

This is both for old and new Yes fans, as well as those interested in seeing ""live"" superior musicianship, firsthand.

**Update: 2/21/2007 -- I think it's a disservice to Yes, Amazon and prospective buyers of this product for reviewers to watch this DVD objectively, and expect to see Yes appearing unchanged from 1979, as several have. As a prime example of this, it's unfair to take shots at Alan White and say that his playing is not what it used to be, 25 years ago. I saw his drumming in this as well as ""House of Yes -- Live at the House of Blues (1999)"" and frankly, I thought his playing was excellent in both. Likewise, for Steve Howe, Jon Anderson and Chris Squire.

The band members of Yes and older bands are human beings as well as artists; they are not superhuman and they age just like the rest of us. Musical performance should be judged in proportion to this DVD; not how others wish to perceive them. They are very remarkable musicians and I saw absolutely nothing wrong with their abilities.",1166227200,7,2782,4.797494780793319
2125545,4,B0002VF5VG,"I've been a Yes fan since 'Going for the One' and have had the privilege of seeing them 4 times live (1979, 1980 'Drama' tour, 1984 '90125' tour, and this most recent one).  And i have to say that I went into seeing this show with lower expectations than 25 years ago, and for the most part, my expectations were greatly exceeded.  Musically, the band were in great form (especially after all these years).  Visually, it was the usual mixed bag of moments - some absolutely stunning (especially the climax of 'And You and I'), others fairly random and not all that coordinated with the music.  But overall, it was a great experience.  This DVD captures the show remarkably well - sound, video, everything is top notch.

But I rate this DVD (and the live show i saw) at 4 stars for one main reason.  As a drummer, one of my earliest drum heroes was Alan White.  In the 70's, his playing was full of fire and energy.  His playing of older, Bruford-era material breathed much needed life into it, superceding Bruford's creative but somewhat mechanical playing.  With White, Yes rocked harder than most other progressive bands, and yet also maintained the subtlety which is so central and appealing in the genre.

However, over the past 25 years or so, I've witnessed White's playing slowly lose it's fire and passion.  And this concert was, in my opinion, the low point of his playing as i've witnessed it.  Granted, at their advanced ages, any of the members of Yes would look pretty ridiculous jumping around the stage and thrashing away at their instruments.  But while the other members of the group are still able to inject their playing with passion and energy, White looked like he was saving his energy for later in the show (or even just to make it through the show).  He played as if he were backing a lounge singer or something, not driving one of the most powerful prog rock bands to ever exist.  And so, even at those moments where the rest of the band were reaching the highest of highs, the backbone of the band was not able to fully support and drive it home.  It was disappointing to say the least.

(Ironically, while White's playing has declined, Bruford's playing gets better and better with each passing year, more creative and powerful and passionate than ever.  If this lineup were to tour with him on drums instead, it might just blow the roof off of the arena).

So...definitely well worth the purchase, especially for those who haven't had the chance to see the classic Yes lineup live.  But if you have memories of seeing or hearing the band in the 70's, you may want to dig out your lighters to add a little more fire to the experience... :-)

**Update 17 May 2007 - I notice that some of my remarks regarding Alan White's performance on this DVD have offended other fans.  No offense intended - White is still a fine musician.  I mentioned my impressions of his performance in light of the fact that, at least to me ears, the other four musicians in the band have seemingly lost none of their technical abililties with age and are still able to play with an energy and passion of musicians half their age, seasoned with maturity.  And I made my comments in light of what i consider to be the remarkable achievement of a drummer like Bill Bruford to actually improve his ability with age (and I say this as a percussion educator myself).  No, I did not expect Yes to resemble their form of the late 70's - on the whole, they exceeded my expectations.  I merely was attempting to articulate what i observed to be a marked difference in White's abilities as compared to the rest of the group and to his prior performances.",1157414400,5,3645,4.550613496932515
2125546,2,B0002VF5VG,"I love yes. I wore out three ""Yes Fragile"" albums, and 2 ""Close to the Edge"". YES was known as the band that traveled with so much lighting and sound gear that they had convoys.  They could do no wrong in my eyes.

When I saw this DVD, which I purchased based on the ratings, as
many other Yes disks were not rated well. (Like Live in Phili).
Makes me wonder if the band has any say in what is released?

I was stunned. I saw Steve Howe, and could not believe how
I thought to myself, this may be the last time I see the guy.
Some of his acoustic work on older songs is aweful. But he is much older than in 1979 right??  No surprise, we all are.  After watching much of the disk, and coming to ""Roundabout"", I almost
fell off my chair as I watched them play at about 1/3 tempo.
Extensive drums during most of the show consits of a ""Hi-hat, a Base drum, a rider cymbal, and a snare drum, that is it. Being a drummer for 18 years, I know this music cold, and I till this day play most yes with music in front of me. Especially songs like ""Roundabout"".  They sit through much of the concert. I honestly thought Howe should be in a wheel Chair. He looks weak and tired.

I prefer to remember them for the great band they were in the 70's, and not remember them as ""beyond AARP age"".  It is upsetting, but I suppose now at 44 myself, we are all getting older.  I even took notice of all the shots when he walked through the audience, most of the ""Guys"" at the show had ""male pattern baldness"".  Unlike the Stones, or Zep, or Who, Black Sabbath/Oz, who also have young followers, Yes does not appear to have nearly as many followers in the younger Gen X and Gen Y.

As a drummer I have so much respect for this band.  Yes was the inventors of ""Rock/Jazz Fusion"", or ""Rock/Progressive Jazz"".  I could play nearly any other band's music from memory after some practice. Not the case with all Yes songs often.  If I sit down and play ""Roundabout"", or even ""And you and I"", ""Close to the edge"" (Not on this DVD), I need the drum music, and I am a good drummer.

Maybe because of the fact that I put YES on the top of my list,
higher than all the other bands I mentioned, I feel this way about
this DVD, and honestly it depressed me.",1156032000,5,2222,4.087557603686636

Having been a fan since 1973 and the Yessongs tour, I've seen pretty much everything they've had to offer. This DVD gives every generation of fans something from every iteration of Yes. Sure, there are a few that I'd like to see lost and replaced with some of MY favorites, but I told began to look at it for what it was: a celebration of music by maybe the best prog band in history.

There are some INCREDIBLE gems, including a kick-but rendition of South Side of the Sky. But maybe the most awe-inspiring piece was Ritual from TTO. Perfectly played, it also featured Chris Squire's bass  and Alan White's drums in what reminded me of some of the 70's concerts... POWER. Call me crazy, but TTO was ahead of it's time, and one day it will be seen as a masterpiece.

There wasn't much to criticize here... maybe some mixing problems... but that's it. I think the camera work caught what needed to be seen very well.

I was fortunate to have met them backstage at both of the shows I saw on this tour and can honestly say in addition to being an amazing band, they are gentlemen.  Wakeman hung out and talked with us forever.  Andersen was friendly.  Howe, was a bit shy - curious - one would think he would have a huge ego, but no, just a simply brilliant talent with a no B.S. class about him. Squire and White were great too.  No visible ego issues evident.

I am honored to have met them and just glad I have experienced them for 35 years.  35 wonderful years in the family of Yes.  As a teen, my best friend and I referred to Close To The Edge as ""The Album"".  All one of us had to say was, let's listen to THE album.  To this day we refer to it as such.  It is a masterpiece - among the other masterpieces in their fine works.

The other day, when I heard that Steve Howe, the baseball player, was killed in a car wreck, I immediately though that Steve Howe of Yes was killed and that was the end of the real YES.  I was really upset for a while until I heard it was not ""our"" Steve Howe that the report referred to.

Let's hope these guys continue to have long healthy and prosperous lives for their sake and for ours.

Buy this DVD, support Yes, wish them well, reward them for having a ton of class, for writing and performing music with meaning and grace, and for being an example to other musicians of today to see what real musicians are, what they sound like and how they act.

Yes is a band with a ton of class! I feel sorry for those un-enlightened that don't know their work.  For the rest of us, Enjoy!

No band ever topped them except Pink Floyd when they played ""Eclipse - A Piece For Assorted Lunatics""(Dark Side of the Moon, before it was released, 4 channel sound, crowd under 5000). Well this show brings back the quality of those first shows. While I always thought ""Yessongs"" was pretty good(and some of ABWH), most of their live stuff was never quite as good as I thought it could be. Maybe it's the combination of sight,sound and new technology(the surround sound is great). Well, all I can say is this one is worth the money.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good DVD for died-hard YES fans but there is something about the way it was recorded.  It's lacking something but I don't know what.  I'm comparing it with the DVD YES Symphonic Live.  From the opening song (Close To The Edge) of that DVD all the way through was so amazing and energetic.  I think it was the lively European Festival Orchestra that played with YES.  But getting back to Songs From Tsongas, if you are a die-hard YES fan, then definately buy this DVD.

2125570,5,B0002VF5VG,"I loved this concert. I have been a life long fan and have seen them live at least 10X.
You will hear some of the classic pieces rendered acoustically as well. I cannot imagine any true Yes fan being disappointed with this one.

2125571,4,B0002VF5VG,"One of my fondest Yes memories is watching from the 14th row at Madison Square Garden circa 1977 (it was the Going For the One tour) as the band rocked out. And back then they truly were all about rock...albeit prog rock, but indeed it was about rock. Jon Anderson sang like an angel. Rick Wakeman returned to his rightful place in the band (replacing a fair Patrick Moraz) and hid behind long flowing blonde hair as he literally almost rocked his keyboards off the stage at one point. And Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White pumped out their intricate, precisely played melodies. All woven together to absolutely knock The Garden audience out of their seats. Literally. Everyone stood on their seats throughout the whole show.

Flash forward to May 2004 where the boys are together to shoot a DVD during their 35th Anniversary tour. Well, seems that the guys have aged a bit from 1977 to 2004 (almost 30 years!!!), but certainly you'd never know it from listening to the musical performances in Songs from Tsongas. Jon Anderson's vocals sound superb. He hits every note (in the '77 show that I saw he had an unforgettable mis-step in Roundabout); Howe and Squire play their instruments precisely and their back up vocals sound as if you're listening to the studio versions; Wakeman and White are also as precise as the studio versions of their setlist. And that setlist is as follows:

Disc 1 (65:17)
1. Intro/Firebird suite
2. Going for the one
3. Sweet dreams
4. Your move/I've seen all good people
5. Mind drive Part 1 and 2
6. South side of the sky
7. Turn of the century
8. My eyes/Mind drive part 3
9. Yours is no disgrace

Disc 2 (85:14)
1. The meeting room/The meeting
2. Long distance runaround
3. Wonderous stories
4. Time is time
5. Rounabout
6. Show me
7. Owner of a lonely heart
8. Second initial
9. Rhythm of love
10. And you and I
11. Ritual
12. Every little thing
13. Starship trooper

Total Time: 150:31. Now that's a nice dose! The picture is crystal clear, and you have a choice between Dolby or DTS 5.1; it sounded very, very good. The DVD quality lends a nice effect of being in the front row of the show instead of simply sitting in front of the TV.

It took away from the live effect a bit for me, but I skipped around to the pre-1980s stuff first, then I watched the whole show again the next evening. I was really glad that I did that, because there was a lot of material that (I couldn't believe that) I didn't even know from the 1980 forward period. The new and newer stuff is a nice bonus and ""nice to have"", but the pre-1980 stuff is why I bought the disk, it's performed precisely and it's ""need to have"" for Yes fans of that era.

Yes fans need to hit the buy button now!

P.S. - Warning: For those fans that were teenagers or older in the 70s, this DVD will make you feel your age! The Yes in my mind were the Yes from 1977. Silly, I know. But it was a shock in this DVD for me to see Steve Howe looking like the Cryptkeeper (he still rocked though). And an aged Rick Wakeman literally just stood there behind his keyboards like a zombie completely, emotionlessly still through each song (didn't take away from his awesome renditions).",1137974400,34,3172,4.402730375426621
2125572,5,B0002VF5VG,"I'm not a professional reviewer, or even a polished amateur, and I'm really biased toward Yes in general.  Yet the price of admission to this concert is justified by a single, brief track that is pure inspiration.  ""My Eyes"" is fun, it's great Yes and it'd be great to hear a full-length version of the song done with the tonal textures, the rythmic bounce and the ephemeral eerieness used in this flash of musical brilliance.  And the spirit conveyed by the band when they performed this piece is subtly gleeful, in my opinion.  I've gone back and listened to the full version on Keystudio.  The depth of Yes' craft is inestimable.  Buy the DVD?  Buy the DVD.  Watch ""My Eyes"" over and over.",1137888000,,692,4.569105691056911

The last one is; 2004 35th Anniversary Concert.

The tickets are soled but YES cancelled the Istanbul concert.

So, this DVD is very important for the Turkish fans.

My favorite YES musicians ( i wish, Bill Bruford was here ) come together for the 35. anniv. concerts.

Songs from Tsongas DVDs ( 2 DVD ) are taken from these concerts.

At the beginning of the concert ( First DVD ) is classic and new yes songs.

But the second part ( 2.nd DVD )is unbelievable. This part is opening ACOUSTIC YES ! . They came in the front of stage and played acouistic instruments ( specially Rick played GRAND PIANO ! ) Songs and sound is amazing !

I never seen this YES performance before !

Another surprise of the second part ( 2.nd DVD ) of the concert is "" Ritual "" ! They played this song better than the album, its amazing.

Another important point is, stage decor. Its Roger DEAN working !

Wonderfull decor, wonderful lights, wonderful visions and great DTS sound mix.

So, don't missed this DVD , just buy and watched !",1137283200,12,1082,4.381909547738694

I think the best performance on the dvd is rythem of love...others are going for the one, show me, bluesy version of roundabout, awaken although all are good to very good. I suppose Starship Trooper could have been better but it's still ok. Mind Drive is another high light but it is split into two different parts the second half played after south side of the sky...it is an outstanding performance of it but I don't know why it is split up because the ritual isn't split up despite it's length.",1133913600,6,588,4.5046728971962615
2125575,5,B0002VF5VG,"If you are a big YES fan, your eyes will be crossed after going into trance mode with this incredible dvd.  The production is top notch and the sound is excellent for a live setting.  Play guitar, play drums, bass or sing the hell out of these songs or just meditate and don't move a muscle (okay, even keyboards or a bouzouki will do), you will NOT BELIEVE the incredible level of musicianship these old friends achieve.  If ever anyone had a doubt, even after YES Symphonic - which was great, that YES could ever bring back the magic...you've been far too stingy with your appreciation!

This concert disk is a YES-power-totem frisbee soaring to the stratosphere...WE HAVE HEAVEN!  Parts that thrilled me: South Side of the Sky, a deep cut from my favorite album (Fragile)...how great to see this rocked out again (not acoustic), they do a superb job!  Turn of the Century, the lost cut from Going for the One...unbelievably true to the original and played with total finesse and loving care...VERY BEAUTIFUL!  Long Distance Runaround (acoustic) - seeing the classic line-up play this with a playful but powerful tone and spirit - far @#^& out!!  Wouldn't it be nice to sit down with a few friends and play like that so effortlessly?  Wonderous Stories is a melodic, musical magic bell of a composition that Jon channels like a lost hymn.  And You & I is done very sweetly, I love this song, as do most YES fans...INSPIRED - and the set by Roger Dean is really majestic for the atmosphere here.  Ritual, the Topographic favorite of many (Pt. 1 - Revealing Science of God/Dance of the Dawn would be nice) is one of the main highlights for sure, they take this song to the limit!  How do they perform every nuance with such total recall, while still adding 30 years of musical growth?  WOW!  Yours is no Disgrace rivals the Yessongs version - this is one of the jam breaks for Steve.  For me, the huge surprise is this Starship Trooper (Symphonic's version is outstanding too) in the finale, already one of my favorite songs - they sound like Jehovas favorite choir doing this song (delivered with joy by all of them, but Jon particularly), and get a HUGE standing ovation afterwords...UNREAL!  It is a great opportunity to get a good look at great new material like Mind Drive and revisit early works like Sweet Dreams & Every Little Thing.

They are so tuned into the magic of the music they have created it is a sight and sound to behold, the audience obviously thinks so!  If only all bands with a great songbook could pull together for a concert gift of this magnitude so many years later!  This line-up of classic members are clearly back on the bus with the music and their relationships, they appear to be getting on very well together which is wonderful (and all healthy and happy).  Having Rick Wakeman back for this concert is reason enough to get it, he effortlessly rocks the house and plays his parts with precision.

I see that there IS HOPE for getting older, even into your 60's and beyond, to seem ageless, timeless and plain old KICK ASS as you dance your way to oblivion...and they hopefully will be doing this for a long time to come!  THANK YOU YES for inspiring us all in so many ways!

<Sorry> if some are skeptical of YES ravers like me who enjoy this so much...take into account how much of a YES fan you are before you buy because of opinions like mine, although this is a very nice package and a great place to experience the magic of YES!  PEACE YES FANS...ENJOY!

P.S. Steve Howe fans...the new Howe solo piece played here, Second Initial, is really cool - He has a new album out (Spectrum - don't have it yet) and a new concert dvd (Remedy Live - I bought it recently and IT IS GREAT).",1130889600,65,3716,4.51044776119403

2125578,5,B0002VF5VG,"In what was indisputably their heyday and the golden age of progressive rock, the 1970s, YES set the standard for composition, musicianmanship, pure spirituality and ecstatic emotion to which lesser mortals --even other great bands like ELP, Genesis and the Floyd-- could only dream of aspiring. I saw them three times back then (on tours following the releases of Close to the Edge, Relayer and Going for the One) and found them --incredibly-- to be even better live than in the studio. Then, in the eighties, tragically, they caught a fatal dose of the Buggles and turned pathetically frivolous and blandly commercial (i.e. they completely lost the plot). I, like countless YES fans of the definitive period, gave up on them altogether. Since then, I've viewed any new product bearing the traditional or redesigned YES logo with extreme caution, but treasured those classic albums as true gems --the lofty pinnacles of progressive rock. Imagine my unadulterated joy, when, having dared to purchase this anniversary DVD, and upon pressing the play button with a sense of trepidation, I discover that, as if by some miracle of reincarnation, the 'classic line-up' is reunited and making old and new music as if that desperate interim period were just a bad dream. They've rediscovered themselves and the confidence in what they originally stood for - they've entered their second youth. No other progressive band that peaked in the 70s and then faded into mediocrity (and there were so many of them) can match the brilliance of this comeback. A moving performance, captured with reverence, that had me leaping about the room in sheer, blissful abandon as if I were still the long-haired, fur-coated, patchouli-reeking, adolescent YES fan that I once was (not the greying, middle-aged, father of two that I now am!). Paradise regained! If God had a houseband, this is (approximately) how it would sound. There's only one answer to life: and it's YES! Thanks, lads, for restoring my faith. (And dear reader: ignore the pathetic whinging of those other reviewers who need to get a life.)",1128556800,20,2084,5.061046511627907
2125579,5,B0002VF5VG,"""Songs from Tsongas"" is a superb document of an incredible tour by the world's greatest progressive rock band. It's one of Yes' two best DVDs, second only to the magnificent ""Symphonic Live.""

First, the awesome, moving Roger Dean stage set makes this a true visual experience. The set, which is sort of an undersea garden/mystical landscapes hybrid, fills the imagination. Dean, if you recall, did the artwork for many classic Yes albums, and looking at this stage is like watching a Dean painting come to life.

The set list is absolutely, positively spectacular. Yes was much-maligned in recent years for their stagnant, predictable set list, but on their 2004 tour they aired music that never been played live in their 35-year history, most notably the stellar mid-90s epic ""Mind Drive."" Other songs - ranging from ""Going for the One"" to ""Sweet Dreams"" - hadn't been visited since the 70s, and obligatory pieces like ""Roundabout"" were given fresh arrangements. And there were the 20-minute epics - in addition to ""Mind Drive,"" the show features an excellent version of ""Ritual.""

The musician line-up is stellar. While the Yes line-up seems to change as frequently as the weather, on this night it was the classic line up of Anderson/Howe/Squire/Wakeman/White. The performances are excellent, but again, when isn't a Yes performance excellent?

The filming and editing are professional and unobtrusive. Quite simply, you feel as if you are there, on a magical and exciting evening.

The downsides? None. I do get tired of whiners who complain that their Personal Coliseum Dolby Spherical Total-Immersion System version 9,000.0 was lab tested in Switzerland to find this DVD is mixed infinitesimally to the whatever (detectable to radiologically-mutated chihuahuas and Borneo guano bats, but not humans of course).

So again, this is an awesome tour of the one of the greatest musical forces of all time, on one of their greatest tours. Highly, highly recommended.",1128124800,9,1967,5.1892744479495265
2125580,4,B0002VF5VG,"This is a very good Yes concert DVD.  What keeps it from getting five stars has more to do with the setlist selection than the actual performance.  Basically, the inclusion of ""Mind Drive"" slows down the entire show ... and considering it it played in the first half of the show, its inclusion kinda makes it feel like this show never really gets started.  After ""Mind Drive"" (which inexplicably is divided in different sections rather than played once through) is over, the show gets MUCH better.

This DVD captures excellent performances of ""Ritual,"" ""Turn of the Century,"" and ""Starship Trooper.""  And although ""Mind Drive"" was a bad choice, the inclusion of rarely played songs such as ""Sweet Dreams,"" ""Going for the One,"" ""The Meeting,"" ""Time is Time,"" and ""Every Little Thing"" is a real treat.  Anderson seems to be having a blast towards the end of the show.  The acoustic section in the middle is also enjoyable.

There are no extra features of note here, but the concert itself is very well-filmed.  White's drumming is hard to hear at times -- but that is usually the case in concert too!  Not the best Yes DVD (that would be _Symphonic Live_ or _Live from the House of Blues_) -- but definitely should be something a long time fan adds to his or her collection.",1127865600,3,1272,4.663677130044843

Buy this DVD and you will play it over and over!

2125582,4,B0002VF5VG,"The good:  The concert is well paced, song selection is fantastic with too many highlights to name, the band is mostly ""on"" with particularly excellent bass work throughout, Jon is in fine voice, elegant Roger Dean stage, ...

The not so good...:

video - I understand that, for ""Symphonic"" they did not film the first night in Amsterdam and the lighting was different to optimize filming of the second show on November 22, 2001.  That crew got the lighting and filming right IMHO.  On Tsongas, the filming fails to capture the elegance of the stage and the lighting of the two shows I caught in 2004.  There are constant washes of blues that often obscure much of what is happening on stage.

sound -  There are few excuse for producing DVDs with anything but impeccable sound given today's technologies. The PBS site states ""...SOUNDSTAGE has been reborn! The production uses state of the art high-definition video equipment, and is digitally recorded and mixed in Dolby 5.1""  However, compared to the dts track on Symphonic or, for example, the excellent Boz Scaggs Greatest Hits and ELO's Zoom, Tsongas falls below today's standards.  (With ""Zoom"", listening to the dts track is like standing on stage next to Jeff Lynn.)  When I read others' feedback my first thought was that, in contrast to Symphonic, Tsongas must default to 5.1 and that other reviewers were not adjusting their receiver accordingly if their unit did not perform this automatically.  Wrong!  In fact, when I listened to the dts track, I thought that someone had fooled around with the DVD player and inadvertantly changed the setting from bitstream.  I then put in Symphonic to make sure it wasn't the system.  Nope!  Switching from LPCM to 5.1 seems like someone draped a sheet over the speakers and switching to dts was yet another sonic step down.  I also found Alan White often much too low in the mix and JA a tad too high.

Yes remain my favourite band  but listening to Tsongas in LPCM using our receiver's ""concert hall"" setting is not what I had in mind but to my ears this is the best option for me.  One might argue that such a setting more closely approximates being at the show than does DD5.1 or dts.  I recall reading that, with Symphonic, Alan White was so thrilled with the outcome his enthusiasm prompted him to call his bandmates...  I understand his enthusiasm and when friends come over to check out the system I most often use Symphoni for the demo.  Given the DVD's put out by other artists as well as the stellar YES Symphonic, IMHO, 5 stars would not give users of this forum a fair nor accurate benchmark.  However, the good easily eclipses the not-so-good and Tsongas is a must have for fans and I anticipate enjoying it for some time to come.",1127433600,3,2745,4.670833333333333

This is a very, very good show.  The music selection on this tour was outstanding, the sound was outstanding and the lads seemed to really enjoy themselves.  One could hope that they'll continue to do so, but one never knows, do they?

The only things I'd have like to had done better is to have the camera operators know who was going to play what at what time.  They sometimes had the camera on one bandmember while another was really jamming on his instrument.  There were some times when I'd have liked to see Rick Wakeman's fingers flying across the keyboards during one of his spotlights rather than watching another bandmember keeping the beat.  Get in there close and tight and see Howe or Squire bending the strings.  That's the only thing I'd say that's keeping me from giving this a five.  And it doesn't miss by a whole star.

If you like Yes, go out and get this DVD.  Don't cry about ""I think they should have played this song or left out that song.""  They've been playing for 35 years and unless they're going to play for a couple of days solid, someone's going to be disappointed.  I've personally seen them about a dozen times from Chicago to Brussels to Frankfurt and beyond and would love to see a couple of favorite songs.  But I wasn't disappointed in this tour one bit.

2125587,4,B0002VF5VG,"In the 1980's Jethro Tull sang to us that ""you're never to old to rock & roll, if you're to young to die"". But it is YES in 2005 that has proven it to be true. Seasoned, mature craftmen of progressive rock, rock the house during their 35th Anniversary concert tour...& this DVD captures all of their power, talent & dynamics.

The set list provies a twist for old time YES fans including deep track nuggets like Sweet Dreams & Turn of the Century...the set also is padded with plently of classics too like Startrip Troopper, All Good People, & Yours is No Disgrace.

The entire performance is top shelf but there are three pinacles that will bring chills to the spines of YES fans. The first highlight is the musical sandwich created with Time Drive & South Side of the Sky. Steve Howe & Rick Wakeman battle lead lines in South Side & lift the song to a new level of relavance.

The second highlight is the acoustic set that opens the second half of the show following intermission. Mellow, made for acoustic performance song like Wonderous Stories are included, but a redesigned shuffle version of Roundabout unpluggled pumps new life into this YES signature classic.

The third highlight is the spine tingling rendition of And You & I. The DVD provides a glimps into how moved the audiance actually was during the souring instrumental middle break of this timeless classic. Audiance shots show many fans turning to each other to make sure that they are not dreaming & to see if the person next to them is sailing as high as they are.

The sound quality on this DVD is very good, & YES fans know that over the past 35 years it has been difficult for record albums & CDs to properly handle the complicated layers of YES music. This DVD does a very noble job. Picture quality is good & editing is smooth & not herky jerky & over produced like typical juvenile MTV videos.

What a special  treat to have seen them over 15 times live since 1971  and now with Dolby 5.1 sound quality I can crank up the volume to  simulate a Live YES Concert anytime I want!!! YES, YES!!, YES, YES!! Let's hope for more of the same in the future. ENJOY!!!",1126396800,,650,4.209677419354839
2125609,3,B0002VF5VG,"Like most Yes fans, I waited for the release of this DVD and was somewhat annoyed when it was delayed. I think many of the reviewers have captured both the negative and positive aspects of this release, the primary one being the audio. I have seen Yes live at least ten times since 1972 and of course was present at the 35th anniversary tour when it landed at the Office Depot Center in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. That was the performance that probably should have been filmed because it was extraordinary. But as far as a live sound, most of the people I talked to agreed that it should have been much louder. I don't know if this correlates wuth the mix on this DVD, but I agree with the other reviewers that the drum mix is too low and the vocal mix too high. Compare it to ""Yes Symphonic Live"" and ""House of Yes"" and you'll see what I'm talking about. And Howe was having an off night compared to the other live DVD's and concerts I've seen. Still, I loved the concert and this disk definately contains some gems that most Yes fans will find hard to resist. The acoustic set is worth the price of admission and there are some other excellent performances. Wakeman is superb and he truly shines on this DVD. A group like this should have had a much better sound system for their 35th Anniversary tour and had someone compentent mixing the DVD audio. Eddie Offord where are you? All that said, I still find this concert quite enjoyable but if you planned on buying just one live Yes DVD, this shouldn't be it.

I DO know that this DVD was delayed and delayed again. And now I know why. The sound is messed up - defective. The video shots are all the best.

2125612,4,B0002VF5VG,"YES is not for everyone, so now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the concert. I wish I had been there. They gave a tremendously committed effort to these songs and I loved every minute of the film. I don't quite get the complaints about the sound. I have a very good DVD 5.1 system and I found the sound well balanced, with an empahsis on the music making more than the concert experience. Ambient audience noise is muffled. Good. This ain't Springsteen.

From the signature Stravinsky quote through STARSHIP TROOPER, the intensity, humour and passion about this material comes across terrifically, and Steve Howe is an absolute wonder, even if he looks older than God Almighty. Knuckleheads 1/5 his age should play 1/5 as well. And Howe is very much the unsung hero of the history of YES. He plays the works of Peter Banks and Trevor Rabin with the same commitment as though he had been the composer. All of YES's most memorable moments have come courtesy of Howe's fleet command of the classics, jazz and rock and his incredible commitment to his instrument. There has never been a guiatrist quite like him. How could there be? Who else could make musical sense out of the naff lyrics of Jon Anderson?

Chris Squier is still looking for a sartorial genie. Hopelessly out of whack with any sense of fashion, he nevertheless commands his bass with authority and still has the choir boy vocal chops to fill out Anderson's still soaring vocals. Yes the key is lower than it used to be, but Anderson still soars where non-eunuchs fear to tread. White seems to be the picture of health and Wakeman looks like he's determined to make rehab work this time. In any case they cover the entire career, and along with the just published triple CD of concert takes, THE WORD IS LIVE, YES delivers a comprehensive review of an astoundingly creative 35 years. it will be interesting to see where they pick up after the brilliant ILLUMINATION CD/DVD of a couple years back. That CD seemed to point to a whole new direction, and given the positively energetic and brilliant SPECTRUM  released by Steve Howe this year, hopefully 2006 will see a new YES release. In any case, silly stage design and all, it is a great concert well filmed and mixed. You should enjoy this one.",1125619200,15,2276,4.614814814814815
2125613,4,B0002VF5VG,"An unbelievable performance. Music and video is awesome. It is a little long, the only reason I couldn't give it five stars. If you love Yes, you will love this dvd.",1125619200,,165,4.354838709677419
2125614,4,B0002VF5VG,This is a great DVD of a great concert.  I would really give it 4.5 out of 5 stars if I could ... because of the acoustic set. I don't like accoustic sets.,1125273600,,155,3.696969696969697
2125615,5,B0002VF5VG,I am very happy with the DVD from a Audio and Video persepective. Having gone to numerious YES concerts in the 70's this is a real treat. The 2 highlights on this DVD for me are South Side of the Sky and And You And I.  The big disappointment on this DVD was that Chris Squire one of the greats was not up to par and certainly does not come close to his incrediable performance in the Symphonic Yes DVD. If you compare the Ritural on both you will see what I mean. Jon and Steve seem to age like a fine wine.,1124841600,3,508,3.9320388349514563
2125616,5,B0002VF5VG,"I was at this show. I was very honored that Yes would film a special show in my home town. I have never seen them live before and, to be truthful, I didn't know what to expect. How many bands that have been around for 35+ years and still sound good without a second band backing them up? What? the Stones! Dream on. Everybody sounded wonderfull. Jon Anderson tenor voice was so nice to hear. He is also a very good frontman who knows how to talk to the audience and a very good back up musican. It was great to see Steve Howe, one of my favorite guitar players. He can still play. I was funny to see his slide guitar roll away from him. We all need a little Spinal Tap in our life. Mr.'s Squire and White provided a incredible rhythm section. I can't say enough about them. Rick Wakeman played very well. One of the best keyboardist of all time but he had a sour puss on his face most of the night. He did seem to lighten up during the acoustic set.

What I like about the show is when they played songs I did not know I wasn't bored one bit. If you like this tour, pick the 35th A' triple CD. It's a great companion piece.

Again, I felt really fortunate to see this show. If your a fan of Yes at all, you will not be disapointed.",1124668800,5,1231,4.020408163265306
2125617,5,B0002VF5VG,"O.k, so I went to one of the shows on this tour. It was one of the funnest concerts I've been to in a long time. I've been waiting for the DVD, but only as a momento of the tour since I was extremely disappointed in the Symphonic Yes DVD (I make myself watch it now and then, but it just doesn't cut it- very lackluster performance). My expectations for this DVD were quite low (hopeful- but I was ready to be disappointed again). Well I was quite pleasantly surprised! This DVD is WAY better than Symphonic Yes! The stage presentation, the playing- so much better! I love this DVD!  I think my wife is sick of me playing it over and over. I agree that the sound is at times not perfect and that Jon's voice does overshadow the instruments at times- but this is live music- it isn't perfect. But it is definitely very enjoyable.  I won't go track by track- but the song selection is great. The ONLY disappointing thing about this DVD is that my all-time favorite Yes song- Awaken- was played at the show I saw (oh yes! It was GREAT!)but wasn't played/included at this show. Other than that- a minor complaint- the DVD is worth every penney. There is a ton of music here (nearly 3 hours!), great playing, great visuals. I'm really glad I bought this one!",1124582400,4,1253,4.35042735042735
2125618,4,B0002VF5VG,"After reading many of the Amazon reviews for Songs From Tsongas, I was prepared for the worst, particularily with the audio...by the time I was finished watching it, my main question was ""what are these people THINKING?!"" The DTS Surround mix is superb on my home system, so I have no idea or explanation why other folks are having audio issues. The setlist pretty much covers Yes' entire career (although the Drama period was once again overlooked), dating all the way back to the pre-Steve Howe days. Diehard fans will appreciate some of the song selections, and should be pleased with the inclusion of the long-requested ""Mind Drive"". The performance isn't as furious as shows from the days of yore, but nevertheless the band is locked into a solid, comfortable groove with some occasional musical fireworks. Add the nice visuals & stage design, and you arguably have one of the strongest live Yes video releases to date.",1124582400,4,924,4.89171974522293
2125629,3,B0002VF5VG,"Most likely if you are looking at this you are a die hard Yes fan.  You might have attended the 35th anniversar tour at some point as I did.  I actually saw them twice once in San Jose at the Sharks arena and then at the ampitheater in Concord with Dream Theater. Natrually I was looking for something to preserve the memory of seeing this great band.

I don't mind the song selection, some thought it was boring I didn't.  The thing that disapoints me about this DVD is the terrible sound quality.  I don't know if it was the sound engineers or the people who mixed the DVD but the low end and the drums hardly come through at all.  Another thing is this DVD's release was delayed several months.  I don't know why the sound is bad and the only interview is with Roger Dean.

This DVD could have easily contained commentary from the band, individual interviews with the band, a little bit of tour documentary, maybe a gear section???  Instead we get to see Roger Dean painting ballons.

My recomendation is to buy this DVD only if you expect nothing but the concert it's self.",1124582400,3,1077,4.393939393939394
2125630,3,B0002VF5VG,"I managed to see one of the dates on this tour and had a great seat, about 6 rows from the stage in front of Steve Howe, but atrocious sound diminished an otherwise great night.  Much like my experience, this DVD continues the tradition of many Yes releases that simply do not live up to modern standards of sound quality.  Someone from the Yes production team really needs to listen to what's possible - like the sonically amazing Steve Winwood Soundstage release - and do a little more work.  Given the vast number of DVD's that have been released by Yes chronicling their great career, I hope that at least one of them will be sonically up to standard.  Thus far, none are.

The video quality however is another story.  Very clean and clear, well edited and paced, this is a very enjoyable viewing experience.

Performance-wise, the boys are in fine form this night.  Steve Howe especially seems unable to play a bad note.  There are times however when passion and enthusiasm seem lessened from earlier days.  The first few numbers go along seemingly without real engagement, picking up considerably with ""South Side of the Sky"" and staying at a high level until later in the evening.  The acoustic portion of the evening is a highlight.  Should they tour again, consideration should really be given to a smaller venue outing and an all acoustic performance - it's really that good.  ""Ritual"" allows for what might be the most incomprehensible percussion solo in rock history.  What was Alan thinking with those bizarre outrigger drums?  I've seen drummers do more with a pair of sticks and a high-hat than he did with all his massive set.  Unfortunately, the normally show-stopping finale of ""Starship Troopers"", while well played here, doesn't seem to be as energetic as in the past.

But hey, why quibble; this is definitely one of the better (maybe the best) captures of this legendary band.  While the sound isn't up to par with the best, it is better than most of this band's previous DVD efforts.  Most Yes fans will be more than pleased.  I just can't help thinking it could be better still with more attention paid to the audio.",1124496000,2,2140,4.716981132075472
2125631,5,B0002VF5VG,"For those that are complaining about the sound, you need to learn how to adjust the sound settings on the DVD.  This is one of the best sounding and best produced concert DVD's I have seen to date.  Simply incredible!",1124496000,4,217,4.4
2125632,2,B0002VF5VG,"I'm very dissapointed in this DVD. It's not that I've been waiting for it and this the result of the 'extra work' is worthless, it's just...

The production is decent, but seems quite weird. Jon's voice seems to stand out while I can barely hear the drums...and Alan isn't usually a quiet player. So, the mixing still needs work since the balance is oddly off.

The music selection. Am I the only one out there who thought they really didn't play any exciting songs? These DVDs are supposed to capture some of the emotion and fun of a concert, but there are some flaws here. Unfortunately these wonderful musicians are past their prime and while still technically excellent their stage presence is worse than a 4 year old in a sandbox. It doesn't feel fun, especially with Steve Howe standing as straight and serious as a totem pole.

They have put out a massive amount of incredible music over the past 35 years, but they should definitely end on this note, even though I never got to see them live.",1124409600,2,1000,4.544444444444444
2125633,5,B0002VF5VG,"I Just finished watching this DVD, and all I can say is outstanding!

I've heard many complaints about the audio, and I have to wonder what kind of system these people are using! The DTS track played through my Sony home theater system sounded like I was actually at the show! Excellent!

I was really happy to hear ""Show Me""! I've only heard this song once before when I saw Yes in Auburn Hills, Michigan on 5/8/2004, and since this song isn't on any albums, I would have bought this DVD just for this song!

I really hope Yes decides to release more DVD's. I'd really like to see footage from the ""Union"", ""Talk"" and ""Open Your Eyes"" tours!

Songs From Tsongas: Worth every penny in my opinion!",1124150400,3,696,4.4140625
2125634,3,B0002VF5VG,"Yeah, I thought maybe I had the wrong audio setting, but as I see from other reviews, this DVD is poorly mixed and/or recorded. Beautiful cinematography, and them balloons, although commented upon poorly in forums elsewhere, don't look bad with modern lighting techniques. Other than that, it is unfortunate to see such slowed down and  arthritic performances, dulled I guess by time or fatigue (Yessongs, although poorly recorded and subject to the technical vagaries of the day, has real balls to the wall performances). Many signature parts in songs are either flubbed or just dumbed down (re:Squire in ""yours is no disgrace""). Acoustic set, which I was sure I'd hate, was actually pleasant. Very nice to have a full show over two discs.",1123804800,5,740,5.016260162601626

2125636,5,B0002VF5VG,Having enjoyed the concert in person (despite the heat it was superb) - we were wondering how well the DVD would be produced Their diligence and the delays are worth it. True to form - Yes has created a classic rock DVD that we'll watch again and again....and again.,1123718400,7,266,4.448979591836735
2125637,5,B0002VF5VG,"On May 1st  2004, I was treated to an incredible Evening in Tampa. I had Floor Seats, and as this Concert was held in an Ice Arena, many of us were Freezing! Jon even mentioned how Cold it was while he was blowing his Hands, as was Rick. So Today I bought the 35th Anniversary Concert DVD, not knowing what to expect. If  you read the Postings on Yesworld about this final Night at Tsongas, there were  many complaints because of the Heat. This DVD is Special, Magical, Wonderful, and perhaps the best produced YES DVD ever. Right off you notice the Video quality is  Crystal Clear!. No puzzle like images that you see from Film transferred DVD's. And none of that ""artistic"" crap that just destroys a Concert DVD. The Sound was fantastic!  This was pure Yes at their Finest, and it might just be their last Concert we will ever see?.  I loved when Jon said he forgot the words to ""Time is Time"", and turned away from the Mic and said ""let's do Roundabout instead"". The whole group busted up, Rick was amazed! Isn't it Rick who has always played with Sheet Music, yet used none on this Tour! And no Prompter for Jon either! If I only had one wish, which is now just half a wish after seeing this great DVD, it would have been Yes releasing a DVD from their ""Classic Yes 2002 Tour"". I saw them playing on a dormant Volcano at Konocti in California. It was their second show back with Rick, and it was awesome!. Mistakes, yes there were a few, but it was a Classic Show & a Classic Tour. Unfortunately  I went back for their final Show in Las Vegas almost 2 Months later, and Jon had lost his voice, and the band was very tired. That's why I think so highly of this final show at Tsongas in the sweltering heat. Funny thing though, they didn't look too hot, I bet their were some portable A/C Units on stage, just for them?. Another observation,  Jon did ""Rhythm of Love"" differently then in Tampa. There he started up on the Stage & then just appeared walking the Floor, I actually got to touch Jon, Isle Seats do have their advantage! And that the Tsongas Concert closed with ""Starship Trooper"", rather than ""Soon"" made this concert even more special. And I did get chills when Jon said, ""we're going to play our last song now"",  Imagine if this truly was their last song  we will ever see or hear from the World's Greatest bunch of Musicians. As another poster so eloquently said, woo!",1123632000,8,2386,4.3656884875846504
2125638,5,B0002VF5VG,"To you people with the negative reviews, you're IDIOTS. Yes is the best concert I've ever seen and I've seen hundreds of concerts. I've been to see Yes well over 20 times and this was the best tour yet. I went to see it 2 times. And this is the best music DVD I've ever seen and heard.

""And You and I"" sounds the worst. At one point it sounds like the entire mix, except the vocals, are run through some type of limiter/compression. The whole mix of the DVD set is kind of small sounding. Sounds like it was taken from a board mix that they just couldn't get right.",1123545600,4,433,4.046511627906977
2125650,3,B0002VF5VG,"I loved the Yes-symphonic tour DVD in Ansterdam - better sound quality. Keys DVD was also better. I love Yes and all the great music. This DVD does have some great moments especially between Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman dualing. The filming is good and interesting. The acoustic set was good because the mixing was different. The sound for the electronic set was not so great.
I hope they release a live CD so I can hear how it should sound. Can't wait for the Live Word Set.

2125651,5,B0002VF5VG,"We caught this show at its Fort Lauderdale stop. Most amazing Yes concert I have ever seen (been to over 20), even though they didn't do Starship Trooper. This Concert is the quintessential sheer unadulterated, iconoclastic, decadence which every real Yes fan should cetainly appreciate. If you were fortunate enough to see the 1974 Tales of Topographic Oceans tour when this quintet first played together or saw the 1991 Union tour (in the round), you understand where I'm coming from. What A Set! Great staging and lighting! The sound mix is superb!  The sound on the Yes Symphonic DVD seems to have  warmer and richer quality. I love both DVD's. Compare the versions of Starship Trooper to each other. This treasure was well worth the wait!",1123372800,6,743,4.888888888888889
2125652,3,B0002VF5VG,"I saw this 2004 tour twice (Ft. Laud. and MSG) and both shows were plaged by a weak and underpowered sound system.  Jon's voice was way louder than the rest of the instrumentation and the drums were barely audible most of the times.  And this DVD sounds the same.  There is a terrible imbalance in the sound mix.  When Jon sings I have to turn the audio down, and then turn it back up for the instrumental sections.  And you still can't barely hear drummer Alan White.  Most of the times the instruments sound tiny.  Even the much maligned House of Blues DVD had a BIG SOUND.

It is a good, but not great, show but it simply pales next to the Symphonic DVD.",1123286400,11,657,4.241935483870968
2125653,5,B0002VF5VG,"The much-delayed live DVD from Yes' 35th Anniversary tour is finally here, and it was well worth the wait.  The sound is good, the direction and editing are good, the performances are stellar musically, and the whole thing is put together very well.

If you weren't able to see the tour, then you'll especially enjoy this DVD immensely.  This is unlike any other Yes tour.  The first thing that is unique is the inclusion of an acoustic set, which is fun and informal, but includes some impressive music.  Second, this show is a true retrospective of the band's entire career.  We get the standards, of course (""Your is No Disgrace"", ""All Good People"", ""Starship Trooper"", ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"", etc).  But the rest of the show is made up of rarely-played material: two songs from the early albums (""Sweet Dreams"" and a terrific ""Every Little Thing""), an ABWH song (""The Meeting""), finally some inclusion of music from the mid-90s (""Mind Drive"" and the intro from ""Footprints"" dressed up as a short song), two Rabin-era songs (""Rhythm of Love"" plus the obligatory ""Owner""), some newer material (""Time is Time"" from MAGNIFICATION and ""Show Me""), and a few deep cuts like ""Turn of the Century"".  The whole thing kicks off with ""Going for the One"" and culminates  with a searing ""Ritual"".

The highlights are an amazing rendition of ""South Side of the Sky"", one of the most emotional performances of ""And You and I"" I've ever heard, the gorgeous ""Wonderous Stories"", possibly the most perfect Yes song ever, and a truly lovely ""Century"".  Other really great moments are Rick's lovely piano intro to the acoustic set, his solos in the Rabin-era songs, Steve's beautiful ""Second Initial"" which closes the acoustic set, and of course Chris' bass solo in ""Ritual"", although it is not as long or as raucous as I've seen it before.

I highly recommend this DVD to other Yes fans.  If you enjoyed the band's other DVD releases in recent years, then this one will certainly not disappoint.  I'll have to go back through my collection to reevaluate everything, but this may be one of the best DVDs Yes has released.",1123286400,167,2107,4.7845303867403315
2125654,5,B0002VF5VG,"I Preordered this DVD over a year ago. I received it on August the 3rd. -that's six days before official release-. I can only tell you: WHAT A TREAT!!!!. Music is food for the soul and Yes certainly is not for Fast Music eaters. Turned out to be Gourmet Music, and obviously, the delays in the release -not being The Band's fault-, are irrelevant compared to the final product. The rendition of the ""South Side Of The Sky"" almost brought tears to my eyes, for made me feel like 30 years ago when I was trying to digest the whole idea of Yes music in concert with their thightness, proffesionalism and freshness as if it was just Yesterday. I'm 47, and while watching and listening tho this show in DTS surround, I'm feeling 17 again. In whole this is one of the best YES performances with their all around classic line-up. Combined with the ""Keys To Ascention"" DVD you get the original epic YES concept. My only complain: why do they keep leaving out ""Close To The Edge"" from this shows on DVD?
Technically, picture and sound are of digital quality, and there are not many extras other than the interview with James Dean which, by the way, is also a treat since there is interaction with band members and it shows some of the staging process. Now, there are plenty of bonuses in all other Yes DVDs.
I'm I biassed? OF COURSE, I happen to have an excellent taste for music, I don't go for the cheap and simple stuff. And Yes for more than 30 years has delivered with perfection and accuracy to satisfy me.

Anyone who has given this a low rating because they had to wait a little longer are so childish and are ignorant fans of no one.

All of them even looked extreemly tired and probably led to the year of in 2005.  I am still giving it a 5 star at any regards because I still support their efforts.

2125675,3,B0002VF5VG,"It was bad enough that i attended this tour but had to leave 10 minutes into the show because a freind was sick. Now i've been waiting 5 months to see the show i missed. What could be the problem? I see now that it's been pushed back to June. How exasperating!!!

P.S.

the 3 stars are minimum for any YES DVD.",1113177600,2,310,3.9838709677419355

8032944,4,B0002VF5VG,"I gotta give this a 3. These guys are rockin' and, yes, there are several shots of the audience getting into it, but there are a lot of shots with the audience just sitting back. I thought YES put on a pretty good show, but it seemed forced. So the audience response may be justified. If you're a YES fan, cool, otherwise, pass.

Okay, I wrote that after watching the first disc. After watching the second this was pretty close to awesome. Lead guitar solos, bass guitar solo, drum solo, what more can you ask for. The audience was still lukewarm, but this was pretty darn cool.",1457740800,,578,4.401869158878505

8032947,5,B0002VF5VG,"A GREAT show - especially the acoustic set - a whole new perspective on some of the traditional songs.  As an extra, a second disc (concert) was included in the package.  I had recently seen Yes (2014 tour) and I realize that they don't even come close to the (almost original) lineup with Anderson & Wakeman.  This is something that I will play many times for both private listening and to share with friends.",1423440000,,410,4.513513513513513
