2909290,5,B000TSJ02C,"I absolutely LOVE this new workout, and I don't understand why SELF Magazine didn't put the instructor, Kimberly Spreen, on the cover!  This is another of those ""do it all"" or ""mix and match"" DVD's.  You can do one, some, or all of the following segments (times are approximate):  5-minute warm up; 5-6 minutes leg exercises, includes lunges; 5-6 minutes back work, including rows; 5-6 minutes shoulder and arm work, including biceps and triceps; 5-6 minutes chest work, including chest presses; , 5-6 minutes core work; a 15-16 minute Full Body workout; 5-minute cool down.  I chose ""do it all"" for my first time, but I will skip the ""full body workout"" next time because I was totally fried by the individual segments!  Kimberly puts her own spin on some familiar moves, and she is so friendly about doing it!  The combination of effective exercises, great instructor personality, wonderful outdoor scenery, and pleasant music is sure to make this one of my favorites!",1193443200,35,970,4.920245398773006
2909291,3,B000TSJ02C,"This workout is moderately challenging and is in a convenient format.

My problem with the workout is that some areas of the body are exercised multiple times, while other parts are completely neglected.  For example, the back section only exercises the upper back, while completely neglecting the lower back.  The shoulders are excessively worked out, but the outer thighs are never exercised (for another example).

Still, you might be able to pair this video with others that exercise the missed muscles.  I really like 'Strong Body, Ageless Body' with Erin O'Brien.",1212364800,6,569,5.208791208791209
2909292,5,B000TSJ02C,"In the Trim and Tone Fast Video, Kimberly Spreen is upbeat and encouraging as she takes you through the 6 mix-and-match workouts to tone up the body. She doesn't make you jump around too much, but creates enough of an impact to keep your heart rate up, make you sweat, and burn off fat.

I tend to comment on the ""pick and choose!"" workouts that I normally hate since most videos usually include seperate warm-ups. However, after pressing 'play all"" I was happy to see that it ran through everything without having to press the fast forward button once. On the video, running time is 60 min.

My thighs and butt felt the burn more than anything else. She incorporates tons of squats and lunges both with and without weights, and I can guarantee that if you don't have good balance you might get frustrated at first. If you're looking for a great workout to tone up and sculpt, I highly reccommend this video to use at least two to three times a week for a low-impact workout. After opening Trim and Tone Fast today and after using it once, I can't wait to see my results after a few weeks!",1211587200,6,1089,4.412935323383085
2909293,3,B000TSJ02C,It's not Bad but it's not great. I feel like it goes too slow and is boring. I didn't really feel like I worked out after I did it. I am going to keep it in my circuit of videos but will not use it but once every week or two. I also purchased Toatal workout in ten from womens health and Love that one. I would recomend it instead of this one.,1206662400,8,343,3.712328767123288
2909294,4,B000TSJ02C,"I really like the format of this video and you really do get a great overall sculpt and tone workout.  I gave it four stars because it is not as upbeat or energizing as some of the other videos I have.

This is choreographed nicely so that you get a burn in each muscle group, but you are not killing yourself.  Unlike some other videos, you don't do so many reps of each exercise that you want to just quit and wait for the next move.  Before I realized it I had broken a sweat without feeling like I was really pushing myself, but I did feel the benefits.

I am a huge fan of Amy Dixon's videos by Women's Health and she is the master of instruction and motivation.  So for me everything else gets compared to her videos.  This is no exception.  I thought the moves and routine in this video were relatively easy to pick up, although the cueing could be improved.

I did enjoy the scenery.  I will keep this in my library as part of my rotation for an alternative to my other sculpting and maintenance videos.",1206576000,9,1011,4.21875
2909295,5,B000TSJ02C,"This is a really brilliant workout that I do a couple of times a week and find it very effective and fun.  Kimberly Spreen is a great instructor who is friendly, motivating and knows what she's talking about.  She's not annoying and she pushes you a little when you think you want to stop.
It's a little under an hour, and 45 minutes of it is your toning workout.  You WILL feel this in the morning, but you'll know you did yourself some good.  There are six different segments and each of them work a specific body part.  Within each segment, you change tempo or angle etc to really challenge your muscles.  I find that that has been a big help in 'shocking' your muscles and making you push through plateauxs you might have.
She cues really well and so you always know what to do next.  I highly recommend this for anyone who does a lot of cardio but wants to trim down more by getting your muscles to elevate your metabolism.  This is a fun workout (done outside so that is also motivational) that does get results for sure.",1205020800,21,1027,4.340314136125654
2909296,5,B000TSJ02C,"I love this weight work out.  Its simple and is flexible to your schedule.  I've had many work out dvd's.  I lost 50 pounds in the last year and this one is really helping to firm things up.
I'm going to buy more in the series right now!",1203811200,18,237,3.8958333333333335
2909297,5,B000TSJ02C,This DVD arrived on time and in great shape! The DVD works great and easy and fun to follow! I will be ordering more DVDs!,1201478400,6,122,3.92
2909298,5,B000TSJ02C,"As per my new years resolution to get healthy and fit, I purchased this dvd and I've used it 5 times over the past week.  The first time was really difficult for me (I couldn't even get through the entire warmup), but I'm getting more familiar with exercises and my cardio is improving each time.  Kimberly Spreen, the instructor, is really motivating.  I especially like the fact that she isn't a waif.  You get to personalize your workout by choosing what parts of the body you want to focus on from the main menu.  The first couple of times I simply chose warmup, full body, and cool down.  The past few times, however, I've been choosing to do legs, back, core, shoulders and arms, chest, and cool down separately.  The leg segment is really challenging, but I know its working (my legs burn and tremble beneath me!!)  But as they say, no pain no gain.  I'm pretty small (5'3"", 108 lbs.) so I'm already seeing some definition in my legs and stomach.  Definitely not a full body transformation, but it's a start.  And my posture is improving as well.  I highly recommend this dvd.",1200614400,14,1083,4.525773195876289
2909299,4,B000TSJ02C,"This is a great DVD where you can mix and match all the different segments.  You'll get a good workout if you do the 3 upper body sections.  There are familiar exercises but Kimberly makes it interesting with tempo changes and different combinations.  The core section is short but tough with ""v"" sit-ups, leg drops and a few crunches.  The leg section is all standing with lunges, squats and plie combos.  I would've preferred this section to be longer and include some floorwork.  In the 15 minute total body section you'll work upper and lower body at the same time doing squats and lunges with a few bicep curls but mostly shoulder work. The last few minutes you'll do chest flies in v sit position then some plank exercises. The pace of the workout is good.  I used 5 lb. weights for the individual sections and was sore the next day.  For total body, I had to go lighter with the weights because of all the shoulder work.  Kimberly is a friendly, soft spoken instructor.  She reminds me of Tamilee Webb.  The outdoor scenery with mountains in the back was a nice change.",1199923200,12,1076,4.523316062176166
2909300,5,B000TSJ02C,"I have been working with the Firm DVD's but needed a new strength training DVD so I tried out the Self DVD.  It is fantastic!  You can customize your workouts or do the entire DVD which is one hour long.  Really targets all your trouble zones.  I would say it is one of the better total body workout DVD's and can be used by beginners, intermediates or just by adding extra weights even advanced users will get a great workout.",1196553600,15,427,4.3

8210590,3,B000TSJ02C,"If you have ANY lower back issues you should avoid this workout. It is a bit back intense. Mainly the problem is when you are bending over with weights in your hands. It seems to create just a bit of an imbalance. I did however like some of the exercises and they did push me to my limits many times. So yes this is a good challenge. What you will be doing is a warm up then legs, back, shoulders, arms, chest, core and a full body workout. You can pick and choose or do all the workouts in a row. The full body workout is sixteen minutes while the core workout is a little over six minutes. To be honest I liked trying this workout but I won't be buying it. I just wouldn't put my back through this again. At the end of the workouts there is a stretch routine however I continued to stretch long afterwards while the music played on. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY! If possible.

8210591,5,B000TSJ02C,This is a awesome workout video. It targets all the muscles in the body. I would definitely recommend it. I look forward to doing these workout daily.,1361059200,,150,4.592592592592593
8210592,4,B000TSJ02C,This DVD is so easy for me to do and yet it is incredibly effective. I almost feel silly doing it because the moves just seem so EASY and yet my husband and I both have noticed quite a bit of toning in our arms and shoulders!,1335484800,,225,3.8085106382978724
8210593,3,B000TSJ02C,"This was a solid DVD for a beginner.  However, if you've been lifting weight for any amount of time, you will find that you will need to modify a lot of elements in this workout.  Most specifically, you will have to include a lot more repetitions to get any kind of burn.  The instruction is clear and the moves are varied so you wouldn't get bored.  But you would probably graduate from this DVD very quickly.",1267488000,,410,4.355263157894737
8210594,3,B000TSJ02C,"You can customize your work-out with this video. You chose the combo of routines (usually 6 min each) that you want to do and the order that you want to do them in. You can focus on certain areas, create a short workout, or a long one.",1266278400,,235,4.0212765957446805
8210595,3,B000TSJ02C,"I LOVE Self magazine and try to live my life as healthy as I can, so I expected to love this DVD. It didn't completely live up to my expectations. While many of the moves are good, and I like how you can choose which parts of your body to work, it just wasn't tough enough. I am fairly fit, but I'm just starting to get back into doing strength work, and I still found this a little too easy. My main problem is that some of the workouts (especially the upper body and arm section) is too ""fluid."" You do a little routine while holding weights, therefore using the same weight no matter which muscle you're working. I usually prefer to use a heavier weight if working biceps and smaller if working muscles like my shoulders, and this DVD makes it difficult to switch weights.

Bottom line: I don't love the DVD, but I will use it from time-to-time to supplement my normal strength training.",1261526400,2,890,4.36144578313253
8210596,4,B000TSJ02C,"I found this to be more of a beginner level toning DVD.  I didn't once break a sweat or find any of the targeted area toning to be challenging, however the all over body toning was a great piece.  I will probably just do that section along with cardio from another DVD next time.  I would recomment Self Bikini Body over this one, as that one is continuous, where this one is broken up, so plenty of down time in between segments.",1239321600,,430,4.219512195121951
8210597,4,B000TSJ02C,"the leg section is uneven (works one leg for a certain amount of reps then the other for less). Over all, I do really like this DVD and would recommend it for the arms, chest and abs sections.  The full-body is a good workout too if you are short on time!",1233100800,,255,4.0
8210598,5,B000TSJ02C,This dvd is unique because you can choose from 5 different workouts or complete all of them for a great 60 min workout. When I'm short on time I go straight for the 16 min full body section. Its an engerizing workout to spice up your regular routine.,1233014400,,250,4.229166666666667
