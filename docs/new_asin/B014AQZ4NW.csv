7385713,5,B014AQZ4NW,"In 1989 the Bee Gees went on a world tour that was exhaustive.  Pulling no punches with a high-tech designed set, the stage was well produced.  All the hits are here (27 songs total) and the sound is crisp and clear.  Note that this is not DTS available as ""One Night Only"" is, but the presentation seems more intimate than Las Vegas's huge concert.  Filmed in Melbourne, Australia, the Gibbs seem more relaxed and it shows.
Typical of most concert DVD's, there is a Discography and a Timeline noting all the hgihlights of the Bee Gees career. The biggest highlight is the concert itself with a knockout light show that rivals ""One Night Only"".  See for yourself.",1010707200,29,663,4.632478632478633
7385714,5,B014AQZ4NW,"This was a great concert except that Barry seemed to be a bit of a camera Hog or trying to get more camera time.... (Sorry Barry Lovers...)
Robin was knocking me out with I started a joke, Tokyo Nights, Givin' Up The Ghost and a few others... Too bad Maurice only got to sing one song.... House of Shame.... He is just as good as Barry and Robin...
The 5 stars goes to Robin and even for Maurice. I feel that barry should have given some time for Mo too.... Other then these problems, it was top notch.....",1004400000,2,506,4.173469387755102
7385715,1,B014AQZ4NW,"The title of this DVD is half true, yes, most of the songs are very well qualified as the very best of Bee Gees, unfortunately, the truth ends here,  the audio of the dis makes any karaoke sounds real music to the ears, the  lighting, camera angles are bearable at best. As their fans for years, it  doesn't stop me buying the real deal ""One night only"" next.",969408000,4,359,4.25
7385716,5,B014AQZ4NW,"After having been a Bee Gees fan for well over 30 years, I cannot help but notice that they get better with every passing album. With a style that is impeccably unique, funny, and mesmerizing, the Bee Gees are still at the  top of the game. They proved it with this amazing performance!
This DVD  cultivates some of their finest songs from their One For All Live  performance. From the time ""Ordinary Lives"" starts the show to  ""You Win Again"" to ""Stayin Alive"", this DVD is one to  keep for generations to come. The sound quality and video quality are  really spectacular. Unlike the One Night Only Show, the Brothers Gibb play  extended versions of many songs in this performance. From the comedies of  the brothers on stage to the seriousness on their dedication of ""How  Deep Is Your Love"" to their brother Andy, this DVD is one to watch  again and again.",962409600,13,859,4.555555555555555
7385717,3,B014AQZ4NW,"I brought the DTS version of ""Bee Gees: One Night Only"" first and loved it (it's also my 2 year old daughter's favorite DVD)!  Therefore, I was a little disappointed in the sound quality of this DVD.  It sounds  like the recording was done from a mike in the audience, as the vocals was  not as clear as the One Night Only DVD.  I would recommend the ""The  Eagle: Hell Freezes Over"" DVD - a truly awesome recording!",956793600,9,415,4.256410256410256
7385718,5,B014AQZ4NW,"This DVD concert is truly amazing!  The Bee Gees are in excellent form here. Harmonies crisp and lush as always, are even better in this format. All the classics are on this DVD plus several cuts from the album it  promotes - ONE.  This is one of their best albums, taking us back just a  bit to their earlier R&B roots, but updated with even greater  sophistication and polish.  Their gift is truly an annointed ability to  channel pure love, healing and magic.  Don't miss this phenomenal  performance!",947894400,13,504,4.636363636363637
7385719,5,B014AQZ4NW,"I got it for my wife, one of her Christmas presents; she likes The Bee Gees. OK, OK, I admit... I love them too. As soon as it came in the mail, I played this DVD on my computer and I was blown away: I played the 28 songs  3 times and I still wanted to hear: Juliet, Holiday, My World, I Started A  Joke, etc., etc., etc. Next evening, when I came from work, I ate fast and  watched and listened again 3 times to the entire DVD. The still young  brothers Gibb from 10 years ago, perfect recording and interpretation of  most of their greatest songs. They are the best. This DVD is a bargain.  Just do what I did, pretend you're buying it for your wife. Happy New Year  To All Of You!",944870400,16,683,3.9779411764705883

7385721,5,B014AQZ4NW,"Quality was excellent.  No cons to describe.  Everything was great. Picture quality was excellent HD quality as well. If you are a Bee Gee fan - you must have this DVD in your collection. And a ""pro"" for me was that the camera stayed on Barry a lot! I appreciated that!",1362787200,,269,4.254901960784314
7385722,5,B014AQZ4NW,"I'm filled with a tremendous sense of loss when I view this concert. The realization that these infinitely talented brothers will no longer sing together is like getting punched in the gut, leaving you breathless for an instant. To the critics who ridiculed their disco years, only to see disco reborn in the 90's, I offer my sincerest loathing. This video is priceless, worth every cent. We are witnessing the Brothers at their peak. I had forever wished they had recorded their ""Live at last"" performance, but was so pleasantly surprised to find this concert.  Music connoisseurs will understand the significance of this performance and will surely experience a bitter sweet sentiment.  Master song writers, producers and performers, the Brothers Gibb have made their mark. Buy this DVD, watch it with your children, and explain to them why that tear is running down your cheek.",1263340800,5,880,5.062068965517241
7385723,5,B014AQZ4NW,"This isn't really a review of the concert but I am giving the show TWO BIG THUMBS UP. I also have the two disc ""One Night Only"" set and this 1992 in Melbourne, Australia blows it away. In the latter cocerts Barry Gibb has a bad back and he is in a lot of pain. He simply cannot hit the high notes at that point. The Australian show portrays the brothers when they still had all of their musical chops. The performance is simply amazing. I really find it quite hard to fault the guys for anything on the disc. The music is wonderful, the energy is great, the sound is great, the video is great. This is the Bee Gees concert that should be the NUMBER ONE BEE GEES seller.

I hope this dvd is re-released. I have a bootleg copy of the show and even that doesn't slow the boys down a bit.
This is one EXCELLENT Bee Gees concert with the brothers in there PRIME doing what they did BEST.

A+++",1262390400,4,888,4.097701149425287
7385724,5,B014AQZ4NW,"this is a great dvd, i loved it. i think they sounded better than the newer dvd because they are younger ther voices sound great, it was nice to see them younger.",1131494400,8,162,4.09375
7385725,5,B014AQZ4NW,"I hope one day concerts like ""Bee Gees in Royal Albert Hall 1968"" or ""Main Course concert in 1975"" are released.  By now, among the released concerts, this is far the best.  Barry Gibb's vocal is impeccable (in ""One Night Only"" and ""Live by Request"" his vocal clearly shows deterioration).  Robin's voice is killer as always (although he is even better in ONO).  And Maurice is amazing in ""Islands in the Stream"".  It has the best performance of songs like ""How deep is your love"".  Of course this DVD is not so digitally-processed like ONO but it is more real.  The full band including the chorus delivers a perfect sound.  There are no lipsync sequences like in ONO and the brothers look very very relaxed.  The lights and the design of the stage have very good taste, and even the keyboards sound with more quality than in ONO (in ONO keyboards often sound like chip synth sound).  Even when you already have ONO, you still need to get this one.  I watched it more than 100 times and I still enjoy it.  I think in ebay this is still available.  Good luck!",1084492800,12,1058,4.447916666666667
7385726,5,B014AQZ4NW,"Since the unfortunate passing of Maurice Gibb earlier this year, we will never be able to see the Brothers Gibb perform and sadly all that is left visually, is a few concert performances.  This one is special as it is their first tour comeback since their disco days and they are in terrific form.
  I have their One Night Only dvd, which is superior in sound quality due to the DTS format, but the camera work and the atmosphere in this concert, filmed in Australia, is nothing short of superb.  The video quality and filming is excellent and the sound is more than adequate.
  It is also the only true video record of the three Gibbs in concert that provides a glimpse of their superb music and harmonies at a point in their careers where they were once again on the rise and greatly appreciated.  I prefer to remember them in this concert as opposed to the One Night Only one as they not only look better (youth is so fleeting), but they also, in my opinion sound better.  A bonus is the number of new songs included in this concert such as One, Julliette, etc.
  This is the Bee Gees in their prime and that is the way you would want to remember them.  Barry's dominate voice demonstates his great range and perfect pitch and Robin, the perfectionist, is sensational on his solo numbers.  Maurice blends in his underated harmonies and demonstates his solo abilities.  Sadly, we will never again experience his beautiful talent.
  If you like the Bee Gees, you will not be disappointed.  There are many live audio recordings of the Gibbs that are worth listening to.  Sadly there are few good visual performances available due to the lack of technology in the past.  This is the best quality visual record of the Gibbs that you can get of the brothers in their prime.  A definite must see for any Bee Gee fan.",1069200000,38,1812,4.5030674846625764
7385727,5,B014AQZ4NW,"The ""One for All"" concert is even more fun than ""One Night Only"" because the (younger)Bee Gees performed new songs such as ""Juliet,"" ""Giving up the Ghost,"" and other songs from the ""One"" CD and Robin's solo CD ""How old are you?"" The Bee Gees were animated, relaxed, and very soulful. The band rocked. I agree with one fan that Barry hogged the camera; I wanted more Maurice and Robin. Robin was in excellent voice -- his vibrato was under control and he just poured out pure tones. ""Juliet"" and ""I Started a Joke"" were highlights of the show, and Robin deservedly earned his ovation. Maurice finally got to display his harmonic skills with Barry on ""Island in the Stream."" Loved the visuals and harmonies on ""You win again,"" a number One hit in Europe but hardly heard of in the US. If anyone wants to know what the big deal was about the Brothers Gibb, head for the ""One for All"" DVD to see them in their prime.",1052352000,33,912,4.402366863905326
7385728,5,B014AQZ4NW,"This DVD is great!  I love it because it has the song ""Spicks and Specks""  They don't play that song on any of the other DVD's they have produced.  The music quality is good.  The DVD quality is of lesser quality than their others but it is still a great DVD!  To me if you like the Bee Gee's you can't go wrong with this one.",1039996800,6,326,3.878787878787879
7385729,5,B014AQZ4NW,"This concert is a joy.  All three brothers are a delight, with Robin at his best.  Music is fabulous, the energy electric, and the men fascinating.  This is a two-part set in VHS.  The only disappointment is with Part II (the last part of the concert). There are a few songs, the finale, then 3/4 of annoying static and blank tape. The DVD version should eliminate the problem. Recommended for all Bee Gees fans, or those wondering why the Bee Gees have such universal appeal!",1035676800,11,476,4.564705882352941

8730152,5,B014AQZ4NW,"Unfortunately out of print at the time of this review, this is by far the best live concert the Bee Gees ever played. They were at their best. They played most of the greatest hits. An unforgettable concert!",1476057600,,207,4.473684210526316
8730153,3,B014AQZ4NW,"I pull this one out to watch every couple of years.  The brothers sound great and look like they're having a good time.  However, the audio was not top quality as others have mentioned.  The 2014 Warner Brothers 5CD box set includes a remastered audio version of this concert on 2CDs, and the sound quality is exceptional.  I did not particularly care for the video quality - the close up shots looked too grainy and often were not flattering. One thing I noticed is the set list only includes 2 Barry falsetto numbers - Stayin' Alive and You Should Be Dancing.  Even on Nights on Broadway, Barry does not sing falsetto on the bridge. I recall One Night Only had several more falsettos. That's not a criticism of One for All - just an observation for those who like the falsetto tunes. Overall, I enjoyed the DVD.  I really hope one day they release the ""Here At Last"" or ""Spirits 79"" concerts on DVD.  I'd buy those in a heartbeat!",1398211200,,932,4.447058823529412
8730154,2,B014AQZ4NW,"This is easily the best concert performance of the Bee Gees to be captured on video. They were at the top of their game for this show and the set list is almost perfect. The problem is that MPI Video seriously messed up the sound when they encoded this disc to DVD. The picture quality is fine -- very good, even. But the sound? It's terrible.

MPI was responsible for the earlier home-video releases of this show on both VHS and laserdisc -- and the sound quality of those is spectacular, especially on the laserdisc. But when it came time to produce a DVD of this show, somebody at MPI threw the wrong switch or got everything out of phase. And we're not talking about slightly inferior sound quality. It's bad, and it's immediately noticeable. And since there is only one audio track on the DVD (stereo, supposedly, with no surround option), there's only so much you can do to try to improve it. (I played with my receiver's sound-field settings for 10 minutes and found a fake-surround effect that helps just a bit, but not much.)

I really wish MPI would take another shot at releasing this show on DVD, this time with corrected audio. Until then, I'll have to watch my old laserdisc copy.

Note: In 2012 and 2013, some foreign companies re-released this DVD under their own brand, but it's the same MPI master -- and even includes the MPI logo at the beginning of the presentation. The sound quality is no better on those releases.",1396310400,,1437,4.54054054054054

8730158,5,B014AQZ4NW,"Fantastic concert with a truly entertaining Pop group that could sing and harmonize so uniquely and passionately. Great songs, great recording. Felt like I was there in person. The Bee Gees are a legend that has entertained us for over 50 years. Their legend lives on in these wonderful recordings that bring back wonderful memories and continue to entertain. For me not a day goes by without listening to their endearing songs in CD, DVD or online. Wish music was like this today. Struggle to find good music today that shows such talent as the Bee Gees. Fantastic DVD that allows us to remember their great songs.
Bee Gees forever. Long live their music through modern technology.",1378166400,,682,4.837606837606837
