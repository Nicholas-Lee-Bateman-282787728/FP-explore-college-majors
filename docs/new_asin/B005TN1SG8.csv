8486468,1,B005TN1SG8,Not a lot to recommend in this series. The absolute low point is having an avowed convert from the Church of England to Roman Catholicism narrate the history  of the Reformation. Her presentation was so ludicrously slanted in tone and substance as to be the moral equivalent of a Nazi war criminal producing a piece on the Holocaust.,1398643200,2,333,4.741379310344827
8486469,4,B005TN1SG8,"Anne Widdicomb's presentation of Reformation is the highlight of this collection. The rest of the programs are somewhat interesting but lackluster. The presentation by Rageh Omaar (who investigates and narrates the Crusades) is very biased. This particular section of this collection presents Christians as nasty agressors and Muslims as the innocent unprovoked victims. Hogwash, Mr. Omaar.  The section concerning the Dark Ages is informative and equally depressing, but we are talking the Dark Ages here. Jesus the Jew and Rome are both well presented and interesting as well. All in all, not bad, but not the best series I have ever seen.",1386201600,3,641,5.284313725490196
