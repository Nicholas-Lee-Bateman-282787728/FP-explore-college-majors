2558643,4,B000FAKHSU,"I've waited over 20 years for this flick to finally make it to DVD.  Personally, I've liked this movie since I first saw it in 1973.

Some may term it cheap, cheesy, weak on the script.  I liked the movie enough to buy it - and I still laughed at the appropriate parts.

I bought this movie from a third party (on DVD, no less!) for $9.99 (+ 2.54 shipping).  You shouldn't pay any more than that for the movie.  So, this is your 'heads up!'  Be patient, copies on DVD will eventually turn up at a decent price.  Get your copy, and enjoy it (I know I do!)

Four stars!",1167350400,,567,4.036036036036036
2558644,2,B000FAKHSU,"I just received and watched this DVD. Although viewable, both the video and audio are not DVD quality; it appears to have been made from a poor quality video cassette recording. The audio is particularly poor, as it is unintelligible in places.

Also, there is no scene selection, so if you want to stop in the middle and continue watching later, you have to leave your DVD player on pause.

This humorous story deserves a much better DVD.",1154304000,9,439,4.615384615384615

8119869,3,B000FAKHSU,"This DVD reminds me of how bad the old blaxploitation movies were - and this was one of the better ones.  The copying process was terrible.  The images were blurred and jumping, making it difficult to concentrate on the actors.  I would not recommend that anyone who wants to watch vintage movies purchase this one.

I will keep my memories of this movie from the first time I watched it - in the movie theater in erly 1970s.",1415145600,,425,4.410256410256411
