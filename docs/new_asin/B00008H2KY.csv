7984434,4,B00008H2KY,I Love Jim Thompson ...Not the best of his Books translated but not the worst !,1425168000,,79,4.0
7984435,1,B00008H2KY,"I could only hang in with this horrible movie for about 25 minutes and had to yank it.  I rarely give up on a film that early, but I saw nothing to redeem this disaster.",1397260800,,169,3.8285714285714287
7984436,2,B00008H2KY,"Way overlong (more than two hours), inept attempt at film noir. The usually reliable Elias Koteas shamefully overacts - many scenes come off as parodies of de Niro in Taxi Driver - as much the fault of director Steven Shainberg and writer Denis Johnson (via a Jim Thompson novel), as it is of the actor: someone needs to tell them that that internal dialogue in a novel does not translate well into overly dramatic and exaggerated gestures and talking to oneself out loud in films. Here we have the often-visited noir take of a not-so-smart guy becoming involved with a ""mysterious"" woman and ending up involved in a crime. The ""twists"" will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the genre. The main problem is that the characters too often act in a way that is illogical, given their development up to that point - they seem to do things simply to advance the plot to the next stage, rather than acting true to their character. There certainly have been successful adaptations of Jim Thompson's novels - After Dark My Sweet, and especially The Grifters - but this one (adapted from A Swell-Looking Babe) just doesn't work.",1341100800,,1129,4.707070707070707
7984437,5,B00008H2KY,"Great writing and characters, powerhouse performance by Koteas, deftly directed by a man with a vision - had a great time watching this!",1195257600,2,136,4.956521739130435
7984438,2,B00008H2KY,"I love Jim Thompson novels, and I love a good film noir, so I was doubly disappointed when I saw this movie.  The direction, while technically proficient, sets the wrong tone, wavering uneasily between brutal violence and goofy antics.  The annoying soundtrack was no help, as it seemed at times like it was intended for a light comedy.  Elias Koteas' one-note performance portrays his character as if he was totally clueless, making him look as if he had just graduated from the Blue Lagoon School of Acting (Some day I'm going to count how many close-up shots there are of his dumbstruck face.  There seemed to be quite a few.).  When you find some of the supporting characters are more interesting, you know the movie is in trouble.",1058918400,7,735,4.7109375
7984439,2,B00008H2KY,"I rented this movie cause it it had an interesting story.  A bellhop in total mess.  Its fun and chilling at times, but this movie is little longer then it should be.  Elias Kortas is simply  a great actor.  He makes this movie.  He is such a young Robert Dinero.
This film was done in 1998, but just released on video/DVD cause it was done by the director who did ""Secretary.""  This film I wouldn't put in ""Film Noir"" class like the back of box says, but I guess in the new genre of sorts: Post-Tarantino.
This movie is perfect for a rental.  Instead of picking the usual Hollywood BS, you should give this one a shot.  William H. Macy has a very small role so be warned when you see him on the cover.",1051315200,8,702,4.140740740740741
