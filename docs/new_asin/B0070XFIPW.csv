8507872,2,B0070XFIPW,"This was not one of my favorites.  The filming looked low budget.  The actors are new and young so the quality of the acting was not great.  The girl played too coy for my liking.  The guy was trying to come off as being a laid back charmer, but he just couldn't pull it off.  Also, just in general, the cheesiness factor was a little too high for my taste.  Better luck next time kids.",1348185600,,386,4.08
