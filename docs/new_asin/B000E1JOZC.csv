8103882,2,B000E1JOZC,"Disappointing. You would think that, with a title like ""Golf Magazine Top 100 Teachers..."", that there would be at least 100 tips. The total is 18 and some of them aren't particularly enlightening. There are better golf instructional DVDs for the money.",1232841600,3,253,5.0476190476190474
