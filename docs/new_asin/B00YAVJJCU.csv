8717789,4,B00YAVJJCU,"Both of these fight cards were pretty decent with 185 being the better of the two.  You get 3 discs, one each that showcases the main cards for each event and a third disc that collects both of the undercards.  Standout fights from 185 include: the beating that Dos Anjos delivers to Anthony PettisAnjos looked and acted like a beast but mad respect goes to Pettis for surviving the beating of his life; while the fight was very lop-sided Joanna Jedrzejczyk stopped a previously dominant Carla Esparza to take the title and you could taste the blood in the water as Joannas takedown defense and sharp-to-a-point boxing disoriented the champion and took her will.  Standout fights from 186 include: Demetrious Johnson pulling off a submission against a game Kyoji Horiguchi in the literal last second of the fight; the quick sit down, son! TKO of John Makdessi against Shane Campbell.  For the value of this collection compared to how much these fights cost to buy PPV, you cant beat it.",1460160000,,986,4.7823529411764705

8717794,1,B00YAVJJCU,"Another waste of time. both main events are in the shrimp division, both are decisions, oh wait, the MM fight is finished in round 5 with 1 second to go. Pettis receives a concussion in the first minute and is not the same throughout the entire fight, basically just taking an unnecessary beating.

Some women with unpronounceable names, Riggs vs cote, wow thats the best ufc can do?

Next ppv is also headlined by the worlds smallest fighters! And Riggs will be fighting too!!",1441152000,,477,4.666666666666667
