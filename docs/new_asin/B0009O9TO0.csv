8064066,1,B0009O9TO0,"One of my most favorites and one of my oldest sister's and my laughing session movies.  With that said, the package says that it is digitally remastered, but when played the quality is so poor, until I could barely understand what I was seeing.  I am requesting a refund.",1484438400,,271,4.510204081632653

8064070,5,B0009O9TO0,"I loved these stories when I was a kid.  I show these adventures to my grandson and he likes them too.  He especially likes Neal the Saint Barnard.  The whole family can watch these shows with out worry of language, violence, or nudity.",1384732800,,236,4.441860465116279
8064071,5,B0009O9TO0,"Again, One of the best show's from the 50's! I have nothing to say except Hollywood could take a lesson from it's past and show more programs like this and lay off the sex and extreme violence.",1352851200,5,193,4.243243243243243

8064073,5,B0009O9TO0,"If you like old classics, this is one to buy.  It is very good light entertainment and humorous.  I was always a fan of Topper when I was a child.",1209168000,2,146,3.8333333333333335
8064074,4,B0009O9TO0,"This DVD contains four episodes:
Second Honeymoon 1.8.54
Trip To Lisbon 2.12.54
Topper Goes West 4.30.54
A Ghostly Joke (AKA Sweepstakes) 5.7.54
Critics Choice single layer DVD (DVD5) Video very good. Sound fair.
First there are no commericals on this DVD. (Volume one has some old Camel commericals) Very watchable for someone who grew up with broadcast TV. This (Volume 2) and Volume one give eight different episodes of Topper the TV series. Critics Choice seems to have a better quality video than Alpha. Without the Platinum logo in the lower right corner (TV Classics, The Adventures of Topper by Platinum).",1182816000,11,613,5.079207920792079
8064075,3,B0009O9TO0,"I was disappointed, not a good as I remebered as a kid and surely did not like cigarett commercials still intact, but probably a good keepsake to remind you of days gone by",1182816000,3,172,4.242424242424242
