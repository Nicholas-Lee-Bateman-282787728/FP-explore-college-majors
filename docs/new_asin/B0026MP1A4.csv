3854575,4,B0026MP1A4,"Chasing the Green is ""Wall Street"" for ""Main Street"".  It is a very well acted, told and directed story of 2 brothers who start with high school educations and a good dose of greed and ambition and succeed in building a very successful business enterprise only to collide with the might and power of a petty government bureaucrat. Good acting and good direction make for an entertaining movie experience.",1245283200,,404,4.855072463768116
8353224,5,B0026MP1A4,"Chasing the Green is ""Wall Street"" for ""Main Street"". It is a very well acted, told and directed story of 2 brothers who start with high school educations and a good dose of greed and ambition and succeed in building a very successful business enterprise only to collide with the might and power of a petty government bureaucrat. In light of our current economic situation it is a great primer on the the excesses of the individual and the government and the impact of that conflict on the players and by-standers . Good acting and good direction make for an entertaining movie experience. This is Russ Emanuel's second feature, after P.J., and showcases his growth as a director.",1523750400,,680,4.771186440677966
8353225,1,B0026MP1A4,We went from a 30 second conversation to buying a corvette with no really story of what they were selling or how they were making it work. Too much info left out and overall bad directing.,1502841600,,188,4.25
8353226,5,B0026MP1A4,Anyone that does not enjoy this movie are probably voting for Donald Trump!  Really people it's a simple movie with a simple tale.  get over it!,1477958400,,144,4.5

8353229,4,B0026MP1A4,"William Devane is terrific, as is Robert Picardo. Sure, it's not the Social Network, but definitely a worthy film and definitely ""worth"" seeing. My understanding is that the Trustee who took over their business (played by William Devane), really did try to sell their customer lists to competitors, and was removed by the government only after the damage was done. You can't make stuff like this up.",1293408000,,399,4.970149253731344
8353230,1,B0026MP1A4,"Good lord, can I have that 102 minutes of my life back, please? Wooden dialogue, soulless ""acting"" and a set that looks like it cost all of $1.50 to make, this film ""celebrates"" two young entrepreneurs who start a business they seem to know next to nothing about, but still manage to turn a hefty profit. Starring that one guy from ""Remember the Titans,"" that other guy you saw in that one movie once, and, oh... that guy... what's his name? Yeah, it'll come to me...
  The crux of the film is this: several complaints are lodged with the FTC in regards to the unfair business practices of our would-be heroes, namely the theft of customers and large cancellation fees, with which I'm sure we're all painfully aware. Their response? ""Our laywer said we were covered."" While that's all well and good, the protagonists ignore multiple warnings from the FTC, then are shocked and dismayed to find that said commission has opened an investigation into their business. In the end, this film seems more like propaganda paid for by the people upon whom the film is based, a giant whine-fest of how mean and evil the big, bad government is to the small business owner, who apparently has absolutely no duty whatsoever to address any issues presented with which they don't agree. It's like if Enron made a movie with, oh, say... the guy from the Allstate commercials: you know OF him, but you probably don't know his name. Now say that Allstate guy is starring as the CEO of Enron, and the entire movie is about how the government screwed Enron over. Yeah. So, save your time and money and try another film. Or jab yourself in the eye with a sharp stick. It's about as enjoyable, but makes a little more sense.",1266278400,4,1701,4.592105263157895
8353231,5,B0026MP1A4,This was a very enjoyable movie.  A film about two entrepreneurs making their way through the opportunities of the 80s only to hit stumbling blocks and try to rise above them seemed perfect for today's climate.  The well-written screenplay kept the story grounded and relatable.,1245715200,,278,5.155555555555556
8353232,4,B0026MP1A4,"This is the 2nd film by, up and coming director, Russell Emanuel.  I saw it at the Laemmle's theater in downtown L.A. and was pleased to see that Mr. Emanuel is staying on course with his personal films and is growing.  The film could have used a bigger budget to help sell the ""excessive 80's lifestyle"" theme that the two main characters fall into, but with a little theatrical license that is an easy hurdle to over come.  ""Chasing the Green"" is NOT a golf film, but a commentary on the hypocrisy of our government and how it treats the small business man trying to compete with big business.  This film is also a great brother story and the lead actors playing the brothers were excellent.  Plus there's a great supporting role played by the always wonderful, William Devane.",1245369600,3,779,4.575539568345324
8353233,4,B0026MP1A4,"This is a very smart and thoughtful movie one will not soon forget.  What looks like a simple story is actually based on a true story about how the government can interfere with business and destroy it.  If you believe that free enterprise and capitalism is a good thing, and you enjoy your earned freedom, the information in this movie is a must.  The acting is well done, with enough cameo's to keep us seasoned movie goers happy, and the story is smart enough to keep it in your mind long after it is over.",1245283200,3,509,4.336842105263158
