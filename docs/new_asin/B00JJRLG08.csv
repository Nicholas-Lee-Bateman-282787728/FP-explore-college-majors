6362704,5,B00JJRLG08,"One of the peak experiences of my life was a chance visit I was able to make to the ruins of Nineveh in northern Iraq.  Yes, its a dangerous place and the vast ruins of this ancient city harken back to the edge of written history.  If you recall your Biblical history, its the city the prophet Jonah visited after he was vomited by the big fish when he tried to escape Gods command.  About 250 miles south of Nineveh is Babylon.  What does Nineveh have to do with the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon?  Well, according to perky Oxford archaeologist Dr. Stephanie Dalley, the evidence is overwhelming that the legendary gardens were in Nineveh and not Babylon. In fact there is no ancient record that even mentions the gardens being in Babylon.  This fascinating Secrets of the Dead DVD explores the evidence of a huge layered, towering garden and the massive canals that fed the spectacular man-made the oasis imagined and constructed by King Sennecherib (around 600 BC) in a stark, desert landscape.  If you like archeology and history, don't miss this intriguing but too short (60 minutes) investigation into one of the great lost wonders of the ancient world.",1402444800,7,1163,4.756218905472637
6362705,5,B00JJRLG08,"As we learn more of history and re-invest time on subjects, history changes.

This presentation of ""Secrets of the Dead: The Lost Gardens of Babylon"" is a one hour quickie over view based on the book ""The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: An Elusive World Wonder Traced"" by Stephanie Dalley.

The presentation has excellent photography, and not overwhelmingly loud background music. We chronologically travel with Stephanie as she first suspects that the gardens are not from the time and places described, as she uncovers the clues as to the real time and place.

I was fascinated with the size of the project and intrigued with the suggestion of the use of the Archimedes screw long before Academies.",1399420800,7,710,4.949579831932773

6362735,4,B00JJRLG08,"The mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is explored by Stefanie Daley, a delightfully eccentric Oxford academic, who when warned about the dangers of going into Iraq, says, quote, 'Oh, I'm certain it's much more dangerous to ride a bicycle through Oxford.'

As one of the few people in the world who can read cuneiform script , she presents evidence to support her thesis that the gardens of Babylon were in fact located in the north, in Ninevah, near Mosul, and  were created by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. New translations of tablets provide evidence that Nebuchadnezzar has been wrongly credited with the creation of the garden, and by the fact that there is archaeological evidence to support the idea that the civilization of Ninevah had built huge irrigation and water works projects, necessary for such an ambitious garden to flourish.

She then paints a vivid picture of how the gardens could be have been constructed and provides evidence based on the scripts how they might have been irrigated and what was grown there. Unfortunately, she could not go to the area herself to confirm that the area of the palace she attributes the placement of garden to supported her conclusions, and sent a local film crew with a limited timetable to film the area. Nevertheless her ideas and enthusiasm are compelling and the digital recreations of the gardens were simply breathtaking.",1414368000,7,1390,4.982758620689655
8651435,5,B00JJRLG08,"If Sennacherib didn't build the Hanging Gardens, he sure went through an awful lot of work to duplicate them.

Ancient texts, ancient reliefs, satellite imagery, on site observations - a very compelling argument. No archaeological digs were possible due to the war.",1528934400,,265,5.309523809523809

8651438,5,B00JJRLG08,I really enjoyed this documentary. I loved Dr. Stephanie Dalley; she has a strong passion for her work. It was extraordinary to learn about the grand scale of the architecture. The genius in engineering that this documentary focuses on is a topic that is very rarely seen. They show great satellite pics to grasp the magnitude of it all. Dr. Dalley is truly a brilliant women shedding light on an ancient wonder that the world is losing due to the constant war and erosion.,1515628800,,473,4.642857142857143

8651440,5,B00JJRLG08,"Interesting look at a historian searching for clues in Irac related to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. She also visits museums in Europe to weedle out clues.  After watching the video I was so impressed with her theroy, I located her book. Incredibly researched and very detailed, the book is not for those who don't like like academia. Fascinating read.",1513382400,,354,4.9

8651443,2,B00JJRLG08,"An old lady goes around finding clues to fit her theory (look up definition of affirmation bias), there is no real evidence-based archaeology science in this documentary. Not even a single cross-interview. Good for getting a glimpse of scenery and some forbidden grounds in modern-day Iraq and an elementary understanding of the Babylon gardens.",1511568000,2,345,5.407407407407407
8651444,4,B00JJRLG08,"I knew of the the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. What I didn't know was that there was only one writer (writing almost 300 years later) to claim that King Nebuchadnezzar II, who died in 562 b.c.e, created the masterpiece garden in his capital of Babylon.  Other writers claimed only that an unnamed Syrian King had the gardens.

As a matter of fact, the lack of proof that Babylon ever had such a spectacular garden led some historians to claim that the Hanging Gardens were just a poetic creation.

Enter Dr. Stephanie Dalley, Oxford University. An expert in the cuneiform writing of the ancient Syrian empires, Dalley spent years on this puzzle. Her conclusion is that we got the wrong king, the wrong century and the wrong city!

Following her as she gathers proofs to support her theory is fascinating. Those proofs include visits to more than one Syrian site and declassified American spy satellite photos from the 1960s! And there's palace carvings that no one before bothered to analyze  how about a garden fed by a viaduct? In addition to Dalley, we hear from Paul Collins (Asmolean Museum) and Jason Ur (Harvard anthropologist).

The more we think we know, the more we find out we don't know. I love history and the search for its secrets. This installment in the excellent ""Secrets of the Dead"" series runs a little less than 60 minutes. English SDH subtitles are available on the disc.

Happy Reader",1509148800,7,1454,4.746031746031746
