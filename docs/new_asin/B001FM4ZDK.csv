8302129,5,B001FM4ZDK,Very atmospheric and chilling.  This really has a realistic feel to it and the acting is more than adequate.  The black and white photography adds to the chilling atmosphere.

8302133,4,B001FM4ZDK,"Not bad Spanish language, Mexican made horror film.  Not the best, the werewolf makeup is subpar, but OK time passer.  A male and female werewolf play havoc with the countryside.  A pair of doctors and a mysterious Eastern European individual ( who looks Mexican to me ) and his beautiful white German Shepherd try to end the lycanthropic goings on.  Good for Mexican horror movie fans.",1391299200,,386,4.803030303030303

Import-Latin America</a>]La Loba (She-Wolf) is a classic black & white terrifying movie filmed in Mexico & released in all Latin America in 1964. When the Hollywood studios had stopped making classics like Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and in this case THE WOLFMAN, because these stories were considered ""outdated"", the mexican movie industry got on the band wagon & picked up were Hollywood left off. The movie studios & producers in Mexico knew a good monster never dies & that fans of these classic icons would go back again and again to watch a well made adaptation. La Loba pushed the limits by showing graphic bloody scenes of humans being attacked & literally torn to pieces by werewolves, but found success from the excellent adaptation of the theme thanks to a well told story and equally great direction by Mr. Rafael Baledon, a master of suspense. The story set in an old countryside manor (mexican hacienda)about a doctor (Mr. Jose Elias Moreno) who conducts genetic mutation experiments & keeps his wife (Ms. Columba Dominguez)& 2 beautiful daughters (Ms. Kitty de Hoyos & Ms. Adriana Roel)captive and isolated from the rest of the world. A young doctor arrives to the old mansion (excellent mexican star Mr. Joaquin Cordero -R.I.P. 2013- lived to be 89 years old). The young doctor wants to marry one of the doctor's daughters but the old doctor hides a horrifying secret. Who is the one that turns into a murderous beast in the nights of full moon? Find out for yourself! This movie is only 72 minutes long but the pace moves at the speed of light thanks to the many plot twists & revelations until it's tragic & horrifying end. It scared me when I was 10 years old during a Sunday matinee & it scared me again when I just watched it last night. Here's a classic that would have deserved a full restoration of image & sound & english subtitles could have been added to reach a broader market. Still, the film is enjoyable & the story & plot are easy to follow. MOODY & BLOODY SCARY!!",1362787200,,2226,5.068119891008174
8302135,5,B001FM4ZDK,"Only draw back is that K. Gordon Murray did not get a chance to dub this into English. You can follow it pretty much and don't have to know what they are saying, but it would be nice. Kitty De Hoyos is absolutely beautiful until she turns into a werewolf. She jumps off ledges with all four limbs extended in mid air as she tears towards her victims. In the first 7 minutes, she attacks 3 different folks and then tries for a fourth who gets away. Later on her boyfriend turns into a werewolf and then a dog attacks him after he has been raising hell on victims. They then put him in a temperature controlled deep freeze room. But some lady has to snoop and then get herself locked in the cold storage and needs to turn down the cold because she is so cold. You can guess the rest of the story. A little girl hides under a couch type bed as Kitty comes into the room and falls down and then becomes a wolf. Constant action. Both Kitty and boyfriend are now on the prowl. Great fun and in glorious black and white. I give it 5 stars for the movie, but I only wish it had been dubbed or at least have subtitles. You will recognize the actors. Angel from ""the Robot versus the Aztec mummy"" and also as a reporter in ""the body snatchers"". The inspector is the sinister fellow who had his twin judo sisters in the ring against Lorena Vazquez and miss Campbell in ""wrestling women versus the Aztec mummy"". The Mexican studios really have the monster thing down. On the vampire vampire's coffin and others the smoke and shadows are as good or better than Universal. Not so much shadows or fog and silhouettes in this movie, but they have the atmosphere and have done a very good job. I was well pleased.

8302137,4,B001FM4ZDK,"Back in the 70s, my great-grandmother used to take me to the Saturday matinees.  It was through these excursions that i was introduced to Capulina y Viruta, La India Maria, Pedro Armendariz, Dolores del Rio, Marga Lopez, Maria Felix, Jorge Negrete and Pedro infante.  I first saw rancho, comedias y terror movies in the old Marshall Square Theater in Chicago.  On of those movies of the latter genre, La Loba has stayed with me all these years.  In truth, I saw this movie only once in 1971 and could recall scenes in detail.  Well, i was ecstatic when I found this film available on DVD.  I watched it last week and enjoyed myself so much.  Kitty De Hoyos is gorgeous and very convinving in the Mexican classic of terror and melodrama.  I loved it!",1245110400,4,749,4.537313432835821
