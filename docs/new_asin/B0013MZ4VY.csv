8252211,2,B0013MZ4VY,BORING VIDEO.  I'm not sure who the intended audience is.  It's like watching paint dry.  I bought it to teach communication skills in groups.  No one was interested at all and even I had a hard time staying awake.,1362528000,,214,4.410256410256411
8252212,4,B0013MZ4VY,"If you are looking for a DVD that demonstrates appropriate assertiveness skills (like I was), you will be disappointed.  However, there is an excellent instructional section that covers what a clinician needs to work on BEFORE addressing boundary/assertiveness issues with the client.  It also has information that could be used to convince skeptical clients that this is what they need.  So although it WASN'T exactly what I wanted or was looking for, I do see the potential for a great deal of use in my counseling office in the future.",1281312000,3,538,4.955555555555556
8252213,2,B0013MZ4VY,"I wanted a DVD to use with teens in counseling sessions. This DVD is NOT appropriate for that. The speaker is not a good narrator. Also, it is somewhat boring.
