3162863,5,B0016Q2D1Q,I have read all the books in Alexander McCall Smith's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series (including the latest) and the actors used in the HBO series were just as I imagined they would be. Mma Makutsi and her nervous energy and Jill Scott has done a superb job in portraying the bravery and spirit I imagined Mma Ramotswe would possess. I could watch them over and over as I have read the books more than once!,1242086400,21,413,4.376623376623376
3162864,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Its a shame that people who have read the books are comparing it to the HBO version.  I haven't read the books, so I am seeing it with fresh, unbiased eyes.  I LOVE IT!!!  It is well acted, funny, and it transports you to a wonderful and beautiful place where people live regular lives who have the same hopes and dreams as everyone else in the world.  I can't wait til next season!",1242086400,98,382,4.191780821917808
3162865,5,B0016Q2D1Q,I must say that I didn't expect to adore this series to this extent.  I have watched each episode numerous times and each watching reveals something that I missed before.  An A+++++,1241222400,36,181,4.625
3162866,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I didn't even know the book was made into a movie until I happened upon it late last night flipping channels.  Mma Ramotswe's heart is the best component of this movie and these stories.  She is truthful, loving, and caring with a mind that wraps around life like warm blanket.  She uses her intellect to make her Botswana a better the place, the kind of place she knows it is at its core.
This is an uplifting morvie that I will always treasure.",1240012800,33,446,4.349397590361446
3162867,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Sometimes ""not entirely faithful to the book"" is a good thing.. as in this case.  I highly recommend the books, audio books, and now this excellent tv program.  wonderful charactors... even the few not in the books are perfect additions... and perfectly cast.  I can hardly wait for more episodes and the latest book (due 4-22).",1239408000,22,328,4.821428571428571
3162868,4,B0016Q2D1Q,"I watched it with other none readers of the book and did not like it. Then I watched by myself and loved it. I will probably view again before this next Sundays installment.
The DVD offer for $41.99, is that for all the series? All future shows for the season?",1238544000,3,260,4.22
3162869,4,B0016Q2D1Q,"Why, oh why, would you tamper with perfection?  I just don't get it.

Hands down, this series of books from Alexander McCall Smith is my favorite reading. I adore them. The books are by no means complicated reading and though there are mysteries to be solved, they never hold you at the edge of your seat. What these books do, though, is magically transport you over space and time to the wonderful world of Precious Ramotswe.

The books are a refreshing glimpse into another way of life that constantly reaffirms to me, the joy of living, loving life, people, and country.

Overall, the pace of the film mirrors that of the books, but I was sorely disappointed at the addition of non-existent characters and the cramming in of information that we should have learned over time. I hate it when perfectly good books are adapted for screen and altered.  There really isn't a need in this case. Why would an author allow this?

The casting of characters was done well.  Some were exactly what I imagined.  Even though I think Ms. Scott is a tad too young for the role, she was convincing enough. I want to see how her character develops further.

I look forward to the rest of the episodes, but I can't give the first a full five stars.  I just can't.",1238371200,15,1248,4.506666666666667
3162870,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I saw the premier of the Mc Call Smith ""the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency on HBO - it was a wonderful production and the cast fit my imagined characters perfectly (I have read all eight books in this series). I can only recommend this to readers and viewers as a great experience.",1238371200,108,280,4.30188679245283
3162871,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"As the previous reviewer stated, it's not entirely faithful to the events in the books, but it is very faithful to the spirit.  Precious takes her inheritance from her father and sets up her detective agency, finds a secretary and a good mechanic for her van, and solves her first cases.  It ends very satisfactorily with a celebration for two large contributions to the local orphanage, engineered by Precious, and a proposal of marriage, turned down, for now, by Precious.  The actors are wonderful, the Botswana locale and people fabulous. I couldn't wait for the US version, I ordered it from Amazon UK and watched it on my multi-region DVD player (bought from amazon.com for under $60).",1234310400,48,691,4.888888888888889
3162872,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Okay so it doesn't follow the book entirely but I really enjoyed it, almost as much as I have enjoyed the books over the years.

It has been shown on English TV already so this will contain spoilers.

The movies follows a recently bereaved woman Mma Ramotste, well acted by the little known actress Jill Scott as she sets up the only Private Detective Agency in Botswana and her attempts to get it off the ground with the help of her new secretary Mma Makutsi played by the versatile Anika Noni Rose, and Mr JLB Matekoni, the owner and super mechanic of the wonderful Speedy Motors, played by Lucian Msamati.  Follow  Mma Ramotste as she takes on cases, meets many new people who need her help from a woman who thinks the man who has turned up at her door is not her father, to another lady who has a boyfriend who may or may not be faithful to her.

Filmed in Botswana and South Africa, the film tries to be as faithful as it can be to McCall Smith's books and I loved every second of it!

This is the pilot movie for a new series, so lets hope it is successful!",1219622400,202,1063,4.211822660098522
3162878,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I very much enjoyed this show. Im sad that it wasn't picked up for more seasons. Jill Scott is a great actress, who can pretty much play any role you give her. I visited Ghana for the first time back in 2011, and although this is a different part of Africa as the movie is set in, I will say nostalgia hit me with the jazz clubs, hospitality, vibrant clothes, and how everyone kept calling me a beautiful big mama- I was a size 16 when I went out there, i didn't feel insulted either, because I could tell they weren't being mean but just blunt lol please someone pick this show up and give more seasons!!!",1516492800,,606,4.188034188034188
3162879,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"They were crazy not to make more of this series.  Every cast member, the writing, the location, perfection!  I don't want to come to the end.  But each episode is good enough to watch over and over.",1515196800,3,198,4.297297297297297
3162880,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"We've been re-watching this over the holidays and it's still just as wonderful-hilarious as when I first saw it yrs ago.  Jill Scott completely nails the part of Precious Ramotswe in her own way as does Anika Noni Rose as Grace Makutsi.  They really did bring the characters and setting to life here.  What a treat for lovers of Alexander McCall Smith's book series!!  It's a shame this never survived beyond one season.

I had started the book series via a few different book clubs many years ago when this author was a hot and fresh book club read... re-watching this has now made me want to revisit the book series!  Too much kooky fun and a unique setting and characters for detective work...",1514678400,,696,4.57258064516129
3162881,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Wonderful condition.  The scenery of Botswana, characters, songs, and mysteries were great to view.  Excellent acting.  Loved every minute of it.",1513555200,,145,5.809523809523809
3162882,5,B0016Q2D1Q,Pilot is gorgeous. The visuals are stunning and the acting is stellar. Can't wait to see more.,1512604800,,94,4.588235294117647
3162883,5,B0016Q2D1Q,I enjoyed this so much! It made a boring summer bearable. Too bad another season was never made.,1511654400,,96,4.388888888888889
3162884,2,B0016Q2D1Q,"Really liked the first episode. Enough to watch the second. Won't be watching the third.

It started to lose me when the main character, Precious Ramotswe, tried to squirm out of looking for a man's lost dog, obviously feeling it was ""beneath her,"" in spite of the man's money being as good as any other client's, and the dog being just as important as any other missing individual.

The dog was found (no thanks to Ramotswe, who abandoned the search when she found a woman lamenting over a missing human, a case she thought worthy of her). Then, instead of immediately returning the dog to his guardian, who not only paid good money to have him returned, but who had every right to have him back immediately, this woman TIED HIM TO A STAKE AS BAIT FOR A CROCODILE.

Think it can't get worse? Think again. She then MURDERED the crocodile in order to sift through his stomach contents for evidence of the missing man.

I love the supporting roles; the mechanic, the hairdresser, and especially the secretary, who just cracks me up.

But I can't put up with a main character whose personality is polluted with such ignorant, arrogant anthropocentrism.",1510963200,,1149,4.696517412935323

3162905,4,B0016Q2D1Q,"I already own the 3-disc version of this delightful series, and bought this 2-disc version for a friend.  Sadly, this version does not include the Pilot for the series, so all the details of how Precious Ramotswe founded her agency and hired her invaluable secretary are not included.  If this matters to you, be sure to buy the version with 3 discs.  Without the Pilot Episode, I can only give this version 4 stars.",1504828800,3,416,4.594594594594595

3162915,1,B0016Q2D1Q,"Having started reading the series many, many years ago I looked forward to watching it as a series. However, I was very disappointed. Mma Ramotswe was way too young and fashionable, too carefree. Totally without the gravitas of the woman in the books who had suffered through so much. And she seemed to be pining for her ex husband, who in the books was a brutal, horribly abusive man. The sets looked like sets, everything was contrived and nothing rang true to the books with the exception of the wonderful actress playing Mma Makutsi. The scene in the bar where Precious is trying to catch the philandering husband was repugnant.",1498435200,,632,4.754545454545455
3162916,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"If HBO thought it good enough to buy, they should invest the money to make more.",1496620800,2,80,4.0625
3162917,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I knew from the opening credits that this would be an exceptional adaptation of this fine piece of literature. The reason was that the late Anthony Minghalla's name was listed as the director. In the past few decades I have seen UK tv show after tv show unfold with his name as the writer, director or both on the credits. Then I saw his name appear on movie credits as the same. Then he won the Oscar and other awards for his films. He was a huge talent and everything he touched was high quality. He never ever made one of these truly dumb films that are anchored at the average movie theater today.  It was thus a terrible loss when he contracted a head-neck cancer and died in hospital shortly after his surgery. He was only in his 50s. We should have had many more years of his work to enjoy. But at least we got what we did.

I have read all 17 of the books. I loved the books. I thought it would be quite a feat to match the books. He matched them perfectly. The two major figures in the books, Precious and Grace, virtually walk straight out of the book pages and into the tv show. There is no higher compliment.

Precious is the woman in her later 30s who opens her detective agency in Botswana. Grace is the women in her early 20s whom she hires as her secretary. Grace has ambitions far in excess of her secretarial role, however, both in the books and the show. The two of them make a heck of a pairing.

One advantage the tv show has over the books is that we can see and hear the culture of Botswana. The ceremonial dances and singing are included in the program. We have an African style funeral shortly after the show opens. I was fascinated to see all of this as it was too far outside of my own experience to imagine.

Another huge asset is that Botswana is a black culture. The people there in Botswana, where Precious and Grace are doing business, are all black. We never need to get into a plot concerning whites vs. blacks because everyone is black. In America, it is just about impossible to make a movie with a large black cast which does not involve racism from whites being a big part of the plot. It can get really depressing. There is nothing depressing about this show. It is all a delight.",1492128000,,2219,4.248815165876778

I wished it had been longer as it is only the first season and I do not know if there will bee more but the video follows closely to the books and we really enjoyed it.
( A little bit pricey as you can borrow a copy from the library, but I would do it again",1411689600,,392,3.7228915662650603
3163315,4,B0016Q2D1Q,This is a great series.  The TV version sticks closely to the novels  The characters are much like I imagined from the book description.  kudos to HBO for teaming up with BBC which almost guarantees a quality production.,1411516800,,220,4.7368421052631575
3163316,3,B0016Q2D1Q,"What it is, it is.  This is a good production with quality acting and interesting, modernly calibrated screenplay.  What it isn't is the extraordinarily lovely and unique persons and essence of the books. I think it would take Merchant Ivory or similar to deliver the pace and contemplation of the easier lifestyle.  It would seem to take another actress for the graceful and serenely wise Mme Ramotswe to come forth. One could wish for a kinder, gentler rendering with the delightful subtlety of the source material.",1411171200,,517,4.988372093023256

Warm, witty humor, life lessons, mystery, comic relief, and a feeling of being connected to humanity on the other side of the globe.  People are people wherever they are!  Loved Jill Scott as Mma Ramotswe and Anika Rose Noni as Grace Makutsi.  What characters!!!  Get this.  Show it to the whole neighborhood.

I understand there are 4 seasons on HBO, but this first season is the only one offered for streaming.",1396569600,,425,4.3924050632911396
3163381,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I have read and enjoyed all of the books in the series, so I was curious to see the TV version. I'd say the show does a fabulous job of bringing the characters of Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi, and Mr JLB Makeltoni to life. And being able to see the Botswana that is described so lovingly by Alexander McCall Smith is a huge bonus.  The worst thing about it is that there is only one season of this upbeat, non-violent, insightful show.",1396224000,,432,4.2682926829268295
3163382,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"This film series of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is outstanding! Though it takes certain liberties with the original story by Alexander McCall Smith, changing the plot a little and adding a character here and there, the end product is not only not objectionable, it is wonderful. The main characters, Mma Remotsue, Mma Makutsi and Rra Maketone, are beautifully and unforgettably performed. One would wish that a little interview with Smith be appended, telling how he came to write the stories. From the brief biography of the author on the fly leaf of the books, it seems that Smith lived for many years in Botswana, but returned to his native Scotland where he now teaches law. Through these wonderful episodes the viewer feels as if he has touched the soul of Africa and come to love Botswana; a whole new world opens before our eyes. It is sad that for some reason production of the series has not continued beyond the first seven or so episodes.",1396224000,10,956,4.730538922155689

3163387,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I like this series because it is so different than the usual subject matter offered.  It's about a intelligent, good - hearted woman raised in a village in Botswana, Africa. The writing is excellent in that the characters are so easily conjured in my mind. You just never know what Precious has up her sleeve next for a case or a quirky village matter that needs resolving.  It's also an easy read that you can pour through, immersing yourself in a far - away land (unless you're from Botswana.",1395273600,,494,4.53932584269663

I loved all of the characters and their acting, but Jill Scott was amazing.  I had to Google her to make sure this was the same Jill Scott, the singer.  It was if the character was her naturally. I'm so sorry that there was only one season.  I wish that some media company sees the value even at this late date and picks it up and develops more seasons.  Hopefully they would do a better job of publicizing this excellent production.  I read the book and had no idea that the series had run.

Not since the X-Files has a TV series on DVD had such an annoying set-up.  There is no ""play all"" option, and you must cycle through several menus to play each episode - and to get to the next episode.
If, like me, you enjoy watching shows several episodes at a time, it is annoying to have to click through options and make four or five choices before you can watch the next episode.

Originally, I was introduced to Mme Ramotswe and some of the other player through an episode on AFN TV while stationed in Japan a few years ago.  Recently, I rediscovered the series in our local library, where books were available for 10 cents-among them 'The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection'...I became a proud holder of a library card and proceeded to check out the whole series.  After reading the first five books, I thought it would be nice to also see the dvds, I checked out the complete 1st Season on DVD.  I am so disappointed and will write the author.  I have heard of poetic license, but this borders on the ridiculous.  I understand that things on TV must be presented in some very different ways in order to appeal to the audience.  However, some of these cases and occurences are so jumbled up, who had said or done what-the only thing I can recognize are the names and locations.  If you have not read any of the books, this might well do-it is how I got interested after all.  If you like the books, don't bother exposing yourself to this as it will appear utter garbage.  This should be called something different as it bears little resemblance and is really only very loosely based-and I am being generous-on the characters and occurences in the series of the same name.",1391040000,4,1341,4.5041322314049586

This was a series with heart, humor, and class set against the backdrop of South Africa.  No sex-no violence-no foul language.  What a shame that the director died and the series did not continue.  Although I can continue to read the author's novels I will miss the wonderful actors that so perfectly portrayed their respective characters.

This later (more current times) acted to introduce the element of organized crime and dangerous situations for the players in these stories.

I am always looking for films with female leads, and this is one of the best (another favorite is BBC's Dirty Tricks).  And because I have been on safari to Botswana, the culture, scenery and wildlife is a huge bonus.  I've found the series keeps on getting better and better as the characters develop -- I just finished disc 2 in the first season.  One of the all time greats.

The ladies are good but there is something just not right with the actor cast as Mr. JLB Matekoni.  The stories are true to the books in a large degree with some liberties taken.  I didn't like the pilot very much but then got into the following episodes.

The biggest problem for me is the stereotypically flamboyant gay hairdresser character that was added to the show.  I am annoyed every time he is on screen.  He adds nothing to the stories, so there can be only one reason he was added--to make sure the show has the appropriate tolerance and diversity quotient for a modern TV series.  In addition, in the pilot, we see a school teacher teaching his students his principles of tolerance rather than math or science.  Ick! The books are about kindness and decency in human relationships, but they are not paeans to tolerance as perceived in our politically correct world today.  In that respect, the spirit of the books has been spoiled in the TV series.",1379635200,,1111,4.401960784313726

My husband and grand daughter found it ""slow"", but I enjoyed the slow relaxing series, brew a cuppa and enjoy this. Makes a great gift to any female over the age of 35, just my opinion.

The female is a young woman who inherits some of her father's cows. She sells them and opens a detective agency in a tiny town where NOTHING ever happens needing a detective...or so it seems......in her all man's world of Botswana, here is a woman to deal with, as she keeps all of her values and femininity while proving that a woman with a brain can make a difference in her community and at the same time, she keeps you glued to see what happens next.

I wish sooooooooooooooooooo bad that they would have filmed more than just one season.  I know if they show this on channels, besides HBO, people would become fast followers of the characters and lobby for more of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency seasons!

Honestly, this show is miles above the rest.  The endearing characters, thoughtful storylines and beautiful setting draw you into the heart and soul of Botswana.  We've watched the series over and over and even given it as gifts to very appreciative recipients.  It won't disappoint, I promise.

I was not certain that americans would be able to translate the original atmosphere of Alexander McCall Smith books. Im addition I had also heard about the controversy following the decision to give the role of Precious Ramotswe to an afro-american actress rather than to an african actress. I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised by the first episode and that pleasant surprise was confirmed when I watched other episodes. Eventhough it is not absolutely conform to the book and the purists might object, I believe it is a good introduction to the world of Precious Ramotswe and her beloved country, Botswana, and should give viewers envy to look at the other episodes of the serie. All the actors are good but special Kuddos to Jill Scott who is doing a superbe job. She does not seem out of place with the rest of the cast, which I believe are mostly from southern africa. I strongly recommend that serie for Alexander McCall Smith fans as well as for people who know nothing about Precious Ramotswe but are curious of social relations in traditional rural Africa",1357689600,3,1340,4.658227848101266

The ex husband is still around, played trumpet at the father's funeral. Ew. I didn't like that. The mechanic was a heavy kind of goofy character in the show where as in the book, he's thin and pretty sure of himself. Also, what's up with the hair dresser/salon owner in the tv series? Not a character from the books.

I loved the costumes in the show. Botswana fabric patterns are amazing.  I enjoyed seeing Botswana and the people. I mostly like the actors but fitting the whole first book into one episode, sort of took some of the magic out of the story. Too rushed.

Although, as with all shows, some things are not like the book(s), the thing that made me fall in love with this show was that all of the characters were just as I had in my head.  And like the books, the stories have that same gentle wisdom and life experience that seems real and not contrived nor overly dramatic.

I just love seeing Botswana on this show.  All the actors are good too, but the most fun is sitting back and feeling like you are in Africa watching this.

I just love it.

Anika Noni Ross is HILARIOUS too.

Second, the acting fooled us!  I had no doubt that the main characters were all from Africa; their accents seemed so authentic to me. As it turned out, two of the actresses were from America, one from Connecticut!  The bottom line is that every person in the film did a great job portraying a different culture as well as different personalities, while outwitting the requisite bad guys.  The difference between this and so many others in this  genre is that the story line is permeated with African homespun common sense, compassion, and a sometimes zany, usually witty, sense of humor.

And, until I looked up the principal actors, I thought they were all Africans.
Nope. Americans with excellent dialect and movement coaches.
You really DO want to watch the additional material about the making of these episodes and meet the people behind this film.

I have read (actually listened) the (audio) books. Which, in the case of these stories is even better than reading them. (Lisette Lecat, the reader, does a wonderful job with the Botsawanan words. Lovely to hear. http://www.amazon.com/The-No-Ladies-Detective-Agency/dp/1402545355/mywishlistA )
I absolutely loved these videos.
Stories with gentleness, forgiving and understanding - along with a bit of mystery, daring, boldness and determination.

This is the only season. There may be no others.
Two of the principals who produced it both died - within a few months of each other (one young, one old). How odd.

I dearly hope someone picks this project up and continues - with the same actors.",1334620800,2,999,5.350318471337579
3163571,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Not surprisingly there are a few differences from the book, but it's okay.  For the most part they don't take away from the original and in some cases add a bit of fun - such as the hair dresser next door.  For the most part you know the characters when you see them.  I did not see this when it was was on HBO, after watching I'm surprised I hadn't heard of it.  Perhaps it's too fresh and clean to have been popular.  A movie you can watch with your 3 year old child, your 93 year old grandmother and everyone can enjoy it.  Readers of the books will recognize the cases, with perhaps a few changes, but the heart of the stories are there and that is mostly what The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is all about - heart.

The one thing I did not like is that Note Makoti (the ex husband) was in these stories a bit more - or at least his memory, Mma Ramotswe played his records regularly.  She did get rid of him in the last episode - in a similar fashion as the book.  I am happy they did that, otherwise, I would not purchase the second season.  In my opinion he was an unnecessary downer.

Also, I would have liked to have seen the orphanage play a bigger part in the stories as it does in the book, but, it is difficult to do it all and they have done a fine job with the series.

I thought all the actors did an excellent job portraying their character, as I mentioned earlier, you could tell who the character was when you first saw them.

I don't recall any foul language in any of the episodes, no bare bodies, no fights, not that life is rosey, but respectable.  In the last episode there is a touch of domestic abuse when Note grabs Precious, but there was no hitting, in the same episode we see a packet (drugs) but no actual mention of them.  When Mma Ramotswe says goodbye to Note, she gives him money and says ""for this"" - pointing to his horn, ""not for that"" pointing to the packet.  So a parent might want to preview the last episode or at least be there when it is watched , perhaps a good opening for a discussion on both domestic abuse and drugs.

I guess there is one more thing I need to mention.  The books dealt with AIDS without actually mentioning the disease, but there is no doubt as to what all the sickness and orphan children are about.  So, there shouldn't be any surprise that the hair dresser next door is a gay man.  (Perhaps I should mention this was in the early years of AIDS, when it was thought only Haitians and Gay men could get the disease}

I really liked this, I would recommend it to anyone and I am going to get the second season.

3163577,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"When I first started reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books, it took me a while to slow down to their gentle pace. Once I did, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the books and the world they took me to. It's not that bad things don't happen, it's that the way of dealing with the slings and arrows is calmer, or certainly the pace is more measured.

This BBC/HBO collaberation series is the same. At first I was thinking, hmmm, this is a little slow. But then, as I kept watching it, I realized that it isn't really slow, it is calm. Your office is ransacked - the way to deal with it isn't to run around accusing people. You observe and you wait. It's actually pretty Sherlock Holmes-y in that way.

The acting is excellent. The scripts are intelligent. The humor is great. When Precious Ramotswe hires a secretary, the efficient and prickly Grace Makutsi, she also needs a typewriter for said secretary. The resourceful JLB Matekoni brings in two manual typewriters. Each one has keys that don't work, but they are different keys. Later, the determined Grace explains how she can word her reports to get around the missing keys. And then we see her typing a report on one machine, taking the paper out and inserting it into the second machine, and resume typing, using only words the 2nd machine can type without misses. It takes longer to explain than it does to watch and appreciate.

The ""mysteries"" Precious solves are varied and interesting. No bodies, which is true of the books, too. But just because there aren't bodies in these mysteries, doesn't mean they don't need solving.

The feel of the series is very similar to ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" films, and that's not surprising, as ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" are supposed to take place in Botswana, also. However, the films were mainly filmed in South Africa, while ""The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency"" was actually filmed in Botswana.

In this DVD set, you get the feature-length pilot (109 minutes), originally aired in the U.S. in 2009, and six one-hour epiosodes. The quality of the series is a reflection of the people who created it. For example, Anthony Minghella (1996 Oscar for Best Director of ""The English Patient"") directed and co-produced the pilot. Minghella said this about filming in Botswana: ""Particularly fascinating to me was working and filming in an African country where old and new are currently coexisting, where traditional values have not yet been eroded by the demands and efficiencies and neuroses of the modern. It was a privilege to be working on a film which celebrates what we can learn from Africa, and not what we think we can teach it.""

Unfortunately, the U.S. ratings were poor, and HBO did not renew the series for a 2nd season. So this is all we get, and that is a shame.

The wonderful acting and characterizations of the players, especially singer Jill Scott as Mma Ramotswe and Dreamgirls' Anika Noni Rose as Mma Makutsi, bring the characters from the book to life in the most delightful way possible.  The music, especially that which plays at the beginning of each episode, seeps into your pores and lifts your heart.  And Africa herself (at least Botswana) is featured well.

Each episode manages to delicately balance humor with drama and explore the characters personally while still presenting interesting light mysteries.  If you can sit through one episode and not laugh at the hilariously uptight Mma Makutsi, you need a tune-up on your funny bone! :)

The only downside is that there was apparently only one season...or at least I've only been able to find one season available on DVD.  What a shame.  I will miss that cast of characters terribly.

They aren't anything that I would have chosen on my own, I know nothing about and have never been even remotely interested in Botswana, but once I started reading, I couldn't stop! I had to have every single one of them and finished them at a rate of one per day.

If I had turned on this video or seen a promo for it on TV, I would have passed on it. It takes time to ""warm up"" to the personalities and their surroundings, even though the actors are superb!

I had bought the video thinking I wouldn't like the books and watching it would be better (and faster). I could then tell my friend who sent me the books that I had enjoyed the series, but not tell her that I didn't read them all. It didn't work out that way. I LOVED reading the books!

So far I've only watched the first episode on the video. The problem is, I had only read 3 or 4 of the books at the time I got the video, and most of the images on the screen were much different from what I had visualized in my head while I was reading. I wanted to get the books solidly in my head first before seeing an interpretation of it from someone else.

I did watch enough to know that some of video series was spot on and a few things were even better than I had ""seen"" in my mind. I stopped watching because I had ordered the rest of the series in book form and wanted to enjoy those before I ""ruined"" them by watching what someone else had visualized. Now I have given it a couple of weeks and I am ready to see another interpretation or version of these great books that I never thought I would want to read.

This personality is not even close to the key role of the endearing young woman in the book to the point where I am seriously considering not watching more episodes. The ""so called ""gay"" character addition was also not necessary but I guess ""That's Hollywood"" or Network TV for you.

This is way too good for TV . . . everything about the production shouts excellence and it must have cost a fortune. No wonder they aren't sure if they'll be doing a second season. It really is too classy and expensive for TV; the acting, photography, on location filming -- even the little animated drawings on the menu are great.

No, it doesn't follow the books exactly; there are some new characters and the storylines borrow from several books at once. However, none of that was jarring like film adaptations usually are. The whole series flows really well. I also really enjoyed the focus on the interpersonal relationships in the series. It compliments the books by adding more depth to the characters.

What carries this series is the cast, tremendous actors from the hairdresser to the auto mechanic, as well as the secretary who is also a junior detective in her own right.

The actors who play Mma Rmotswe and Mma Makutsi are excellent in their portrayals as well. Though the actors are slightly younger and prettier that what I imagined the characters to be, that is the fault of my imagination, not the production.  I loved the Botswana locations, the use of real Africans in the supporting roles and the use of native dialects on occasion.  It is a fun series and faithful adaptation for the most part.  The part I take exception to is the addition of the stereotypical homosexual hairdresser as a regular character.  He does not appear in the books and, though his character adds an additional dash of humor, I feel that the addition of his character caused the series creators to diminish the roles of Mr. JLB Matekoni's apprentices.  One could always count on the immature, slacker apprentices to add a little hilarity to each book but they only rarely appear in this production.

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the video treatment of the books' plots and characters, even though the stories sometimes were regrouped differently from the order in which the books presented them -- not a problem, as far as I'm concerned.

3163667,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"... is truly what you get when watching this series!

So many other reviewers have described this TV-series so well. So I won't write another review like that, but rather share my feelings after having seen all 7 episodes included on this DVD on TV.

This sure is a type of series rare today. Sure, I love many Hollywood series, but not only is this not one, it is totally different. I have not read the books, only watched the series as it has been televised in Norway this summer. But I have loved each and every minute of it. Actually, I have even watched every episode twice, first on the day it has been televised, then replayed it a few days later together with a visitor. There aren't many series I would have done that with! Most TV series aren't of a kind that I could watch twice in a week!

This series is just different. It has so much warmth. It even has something as rare today as real politeness and etiquette, but served to us in a charming and humourous way, if I may put it that way. The characters are played in a way where you might at first think that they are ""overplaying"", but you soon discover how it is just perfect! I wouldn't have it any other way, the way they act in this series is just 100% (not 97%! ;) ) correct in this context. It is one of the many things that give the series the abundance of charm that it has!

I have had the pleasure of visiting 4 African countries, and watching this made me remember so many little things I experienced there. So even if it is dramatized like it is, it really feels authentic too. The series shows some of the sad things that happens to us human beings as well as tough and sad sides of Africa, e.g. that so many suffer from HIV/Aids, but this sure is no sad series as one might think, maybe Africans have a way of handling hardship with humour in a way that is rare for most of us? Well, if some place on this earth qualifies better for something like that, it would be no surprise if it was Africa, if you know what I mean? And that is one of the things that is so charming with this series, that they manage to incorporate so many serious subjects (there's always some moral to the episode), giving us a little reminder of this and that, all while making us smile and chuckle, and watch in suspense too. The characters, especially Mma Ramotswe, also show so much compassion for other people. She often uses her own tough experiences in her work as a detective. Losing a child and having had an abusive husband, is something that helps her in her meetings with [potential] clients. She is not just a tough detective, but rather an empathic and warm one - and very humble too. She's not one to brag about her accomplishments, she's quite a modest woman, but she might do a little victory dance (when we're not watching) together with her secretary (and later Assisting Detective) Mma Matekoni a.k.a. Miss 97% from The Secretarial College of Botswana... ;)

This series have some fantastic characters, I think, and the actors really play them well too, with a lot of heart, you might say. You soon come to feel quite fond of these characters and I sure did not want the series to end. The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it is only 7 episodes. I wish there had been 70, so that even if this season was over, I had much to look forward to.

I sure hope that somebody will pick this up and continue the series. With all these books, there must be a lot to use... :)

Happy watching, Mma & Rra! :)",1280880000,,3484,4.277693474962064

3163677,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I'd heard a lot of good things about the series, but had not been able to see it on TV.  The original price was too steep for me and when I bought it at a discounted rate it still felt a little pricey.  Then I watched the first episode. Wow! Worth every penny. Well written, well acted, beautifully appropriate wardrobes, breath-taking scenery.  Unbelievable!!!  Just the opportunity to see some of African life is worth the price.  As the series moves along you find out a little more about what makes each character tick.  Precious (Jill Scott)- a woman who had a close relationship with her father. A good man. Her relationship with Note, her talented, abusive ex-husband. Her blossoming relationship with LJB, owner of a automobile mechanics shop. Her growing friendship with her sometimes strange, but complicated secretary Grace (played wonderfully quirky by Anika Noni Rose)and of course we can't forget BK, the very wise and observant hair dresser. The African actors made gave this an authentic feel.

If you are tired of seeing cookie cutter TV shows, give this one a try.  You won't be sorry.

I truly hope that there will be additional seasons.",1278201600,5,1156,4.857142857142857
3163678,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"The series is certainly worth a watch. According to my wife, the episodes ares very close in tone and story to the books.

I thought they could have made a little more of Precious' skills in observation and sleuthing. After an opening event where she showed some wisdom in solving a theft, and then used good observation and intuition to tell her driver much about himself, the rest of the story sort of devolved into coincidence to help her solve the remaining cases.

The mysteries are quite interesting though, even the mystery of a little lost dog. Much more engrossing and meaningful is that of a missing young man, and that of a feuding family that may do each other in unless Precious can work her magic at their estate.

You'll find the characters to be indeed charming, and the setting is very far from the norm, giving this show a unique flavor you won't find elsewhere.",1277856000,,880,4.592356687898089

I watched them all over a weekend and I really enjoyed them, but as I have read all the books, it is hard to give a review without a bias towards the books.  If you haven't read the books, you will probably enjoy the series, yet it is for those into feel good and senitmental themes.  It can seem slow, but be patient, Ma Ramotswe (main character) gets there in the end, as she does with the books.  They have had to change the story from the books especially when revealing the back story of the main character/s.  It's wonderful how they filmed in Botswana (where the books are set) and it is shot beautifully.  Main criticism, is that there were some subtleties in the book, that were lost in the series, it did feel a little Americanised, for eg. how some of the stories ended and declarations of love, which seem to be a fixture in American series, as opposed to British series.  This as a great gift for any fan of the books as well as for your mother or mother in-law.  For all its strengths and weaknesses, it sits proudly along side the books of the series.

3163683,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Alexander McCall Smith's book series by the same title has enchanted millions worldwide.  Now the HBO Series of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency brings to life the books for all to enjoy.  Seeing Mma Ramotswe, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and Mma Makutsi on TV and in the DVD series gives an added depth of character in each of them.  Now in reading the book we can actually picture them and hear them speaking.  Actually filming the series in Botswana truly captures the reality of life there.  I think we all would love to pack up and move to Gabarone as a result of this wonderful series of books and now the TV series.

Kudos to HBO for bringing this series to America.  It had to take some courage to get away from other HBO series such as ""Sex in the City"", ""The Sopranos"", etc., and bring such a wholesome series that nearly the whole family could enjoy watching.  I only hope and pray that those who filmed the original series will see themselves producing more shows of the ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"".  They left us with a bit of a cliffhanger in the last show.

No violence in the shows, no language you needed to beep out, just really excellent acting and fantastic productions.  The only thing that bothers me is the cliffhanger ending of the last episode.

Everything was exactly as I pictured, from the written word of Alexander McCall-Smith.  I have logged on hoping to find a Season 2.  I look forward to more DVDs.

It would be hard to imagine a better production.
The HBO series does deviate from the book in some ways - there is more action, less discussion of philosopy in the series, plus Mr Paul O Petsi is replaced by a hairdresser neighbor.  These changes support the video media and make sense.  The actors are very well cast and the series is as full of fun, morality, and drama as readers of the books would expect.

Mma Potokwane and the orphan farm, Mma Makutsi's shoes getting subtle camera shots, 42% Violet Sapotho...they're all there.  I don't know if they built the house on Zebra Drive used in the shot, but it's EXACTLY as it should be, right down to the plantings.  So is the shopping mall, the hospital...the garage apprentices...everything.  There is one additional supporting character, but he's fine!  No problem.  Every deviation from the books is subtle, and ends up working out even better.  Some of the mysteries are direct from the books, others are not.

Alexander McCall Smith must be commended for honoring the Precious Ramotswes of Africa. When I read the books, I thought that I know this wonderful woman, and could not understand why her story had never been told. Jill Scott is a great choice for the principal character, and I keep pinching myself about how perfectly she got the accent and the mannerisms. She is also a wonderful singer who projects warmth and love in her performances.",1264118400,,540,4.635416666666667

3163735,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"This is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV.  When I watched the first episode of N1LDA, I almost fainted--Jill Scott, a phenomenal ACTRESS (who knew?), paid close attention to her voice coach and fairly channels Precious Ramotswe.  Anika Noni Rose is fantastic as the proud yet endearing Grace Makutsi.  The director and actors captured exactly the feel, the tenor, of the wonderful series of books by Alexander McCall Smith.  From the beautiful cinematography to the whimsical animation in the credits, this is a splendid production.  The show is pitch-perfect.  Anyone out there who enjoyed the books should not miss this series on DVD.  Now for a bit of negativity:  I think it's been cancelled on HBO and I'm not surprised.  When I viewed the first episode of N1LDA, I knew I was watching something different.  I also knew that because it was different, it was doomed.  It is so unlike anything remotely resembling the commercial pap to which we viewers are usually subjected.  The sweet innocence and generosity of spirit possessed by McCall Smith's characters as they grapple with everything from life's little annoyances to serious issues are antithetical to an industry that feeds on insecurity and superficiality.  N1LDA has no gratuitous profanity, no lurid sex scenes, no fart jokes.  The show never stood a chance.  I respect the risk HBO took and I commend them for giving this a try.  I urge them to bring N1LDA back for a second season, and hope they will explore other stories of this quality.",1263945600,3,1518,4.87109375

The actors are perfect - much how I imagined them to be.  Love the addition of the hair dresser character.

She now understands why I've been greeting her with the phrase ""dumelle ma"" (spelling?). Jill Scott and Anika Noni Rose are quite believable; Rose really showcases the breadth of her acting skills and comedic abilities.

3163752,4,B0016Q2D1Q,"The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books are among my all-time favorites. So, naturally, I was looking forward to seeing the filmed version. As might be expected, I was both pleased and disappointed. The disappointments stemmed from the departures from Smith's books. Usually, when books are adapted for screen certain changes must be made in order to adjust to a visual medium. However, the changes which were made to Smith's books were not only unnecessary, they detracted from both the overall spirit as well as the intent of Smith's series.

The addition of a new character--the hairdresser--was particularly distracting. He was out of keeping with the original stories, and contributed nothing to the plots. I got the feeling that the hairdresser was a means of ""updating"" the series.  However, the stories really don't need modernizing. Part of their appeal is that they reflect old-fashioned values--honesty, integrity and national pride. The rather lengthy exposition of Precious Ramotswe's back story was also problematic. It slowed the pace, and added material that was inconsequential. (Smith handled the revelation of Mma Ramotswe's past in the best manner possible--as the stories unfolded--and the screenplay should have stuck with that.) But the biggest problem with the adaptation was the virtual elimination of Smith's gentle ironic humor. In the absence of irony, the screenplay was forced to become more melodramatic than was originally intended. The focus on ""solving mysteries "" and catching ""bad guys"" (who were much ""badder"" than their original counterparts) not only added an element of cliche, but diminished the charm of Mma Ramotswe's encounters.

On the positive side, the acting was generally very good. Some of the characters really came to life, especially J.L.B. Matekoni and Grace Makutsi. Lucien Msamati did a wonderful job as the shy mechanic, conveying an unusual depth of emotion and sensitivity. Anika Noni Rose also did a superb job as Mma Ramotswe's secretary, Miss 97%. Her timing and comic sense puts her at the top of her class as a comedienne (at least 97%). The only real disappointment among the actors was Jill Scott, who did not have sufficient heft (in spite of being traditionally built) to pull off Precious Ramotswe's strength of character, wisdom and unassailable dignity.

The best part of this series, for me, was the opportunity to see and hear Botswana. I was reminded that not only was Africa the birthplace of humanity, but of music and dance as well. To witness the joyous spirit of Africa was a real treat, and not one that I will soon forget.",1261008000,23,2603,5.1465721040189125

After watching the first season, all I can say is: So what?

While not true to every one of McCall Smith's books, this production is completely faithful to their spirit. Jill Scott IS Mma Ramotswe and Anika Noni Rose is most assuredly Mma Makutsi. These ladies are acting their asses off, as is the fellow playing Mr. JLB Matakoni. This is just superb acting by people who have internalized these characters.

I can't wait for Phuti Radiphuti to show up and sweep Grace off her feet.

3163787,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"As a big fan of the book series, I was somewhat reluctant to watch this series. Too often, good books don't translate into film -- particularly into television series! But despite my trepidation, I bought season one and I have to tell you -- IT IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.

No, it's NOT a literal transcription of the books but it does remain fairly true to the plotlines and ""spirit"" of the original books. None of the minor changes hurts the story and a few of the changes -- like new characters -- actually add to it.

When critiquing books and shows, one of my criteria is whether or not I like the characters. After all, I'll be spending several hours (at least) with them. I wouldn't spend time with a loud, nasty or vulgar neighbor so why would I spend time with characters I don't like? Based on this one criterion, this show is a real winner. I liked ALL of the ""regulars"" -- Precious, and Grace and JLB, and BK -- and would gladly have dinner with any of them!

I can't possibly list everything I liked about the series, but I will point out a few highlights:

CASTING -- is perfection itself. I was worried that they would make Precious less of a ""traditionally built"" woman to fit the common TV star mold (young, thin and vapid) but Jill Scott is a true beautiful fatty (not as fatty as I am, but she can be forgiven that one flaw). She's a bit younger than I thought she was  in the books (I seem to remember reading that Mma was in her late 30s or early 40s?) but Scott's depiction is so true to character that it didn't bother me in the least. The other main characters are equally ideally cast with particularly kudos to the actors who play JLB Matakone and Mma Makutsi. Absolute gems one and all!

WRITING -- the writing is funny but never slapstick, poignant without being maudlin, and always very natural -- the way people speak, not the way writers write.

CINEMATOGRAPHY -- short of going to Botswana, I can't think of a better way to view this sometimes stark but always intriguing country. The shots are as good as you'll see in any first rate movie and almost never see in television series.

In short, I simply adore this show. It's the best thing I've watched in years (decades?) and I hope it goes on and on and on and on...",1255478400,6,2248,4.348448687350835

Along the way, the viewer is treated to the sights and sounds of Botswana that reflect Precious' views of her country as the finest place on earth.  The series has been updated from the original - #5 Zebra Drive and the agency office are still modest, but grander than the description in the books - no dirt floors.

It is especially painful in the first two episodes. Did the writers feel this is a chick-flick series and that the addition of a gay hairdresser added comic relief?

On the positive side, the acting by the principle actors is very good and it was fun to see the country of Botswana which is exotic and beautiful.

This series also seemed a bit over priced with only seven episodes for $40. The books are far better but if you have never read the books you may enjoy this series.",1253491200,36,758,4.4855072463768115

McCall-Smith digresses constantly to muse about life in general and life in Botswana in particular a country he obviously loves and will make you love. Television stories are usually more straightforward and I was apprehensive about a television series spoiling the books and misleading a new audience about the nature of the books. I needn't have worried.

Hands down, this series of books from Alexander McCall Smith is my favorite reading. I adore them. The books are by no means complicated reading and though there are mysteries to be solved, they never hold you at the edge of your seat. What these books do, though, is magically transport you over space and time to the wonderful world of Precious Ramotswe.

The books are a refreshing glimpse into another way of life that constantly reaffirms to me, the joy of living, loving life, people, and country.

Overall, the pace of the film mirrors that of the books, but I was sorely disappointed at the addition of non-existent characters and the cramming in of information that we should have learned over time. I hate it when perfectly good books are adapted for screen and altered.  There really isn't a need in this case. Why would an author allow this?

The casting of characters was done well.  Some were exactly what I imagined.  Even though I think Ms. Scott is a tad too young for the role, she was convincing enough. I want to see how her character develops further.

3397368,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"As the previous reviewer stated, it's not entirely faithful to the events in the books, but it is very faithful to the spirit.  Precious takes her inheritance from her father and sets up her detective agency, finds a secretary and a good mechanic for her van, and solves her first cases.  It ends very satisfactorily with a celebration for two large contributions to the local orphanage, engineered by Precious, and a proposal of marriage, turned down, for now, by Precious.  The actors are wonderful, the Botswana locale and people fabulous. I couldn't wait for the US version, I ordered it from Amazon UK and watched it on my multi-region DVD player (bought from amazon.com for under $60).",1234310400,48,691,4.888888888888889
3397369,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Okay so it doesn't follow the book entirely but I really enjoyed it, almost as much as I have enjoyed the books over the years.

It has been shown on English TV already so this will contain spoilers.

The movies follows a recently bereaved woman Mma Ramotste, well acted by the little known actress Jill Scott as she sets up the only Private Detective Agency in Botswana and her attempts to get it off the ground with the help of her new secretary Mma Makutsi played by the versatile Anika Noni Rose, and Mr JLB Matekoni, the owner and super mechanic of the wonderful Speedy Motors, played by Lucian Msamati.  Follow  Mma Ramotste as she takes on cases, meets many new people who need her help from a woman who thinks the man who has turned up at her door is not her father, to another lady who has a boyfriend who may or may not be faithful to her.

Filmed in Botswana and South Africa, the film tries to be as faithful as it can be to McCall Smith's books and I loved every second of it!

This is the pilot movie for a new series, so lets hope it is successful!",1219622400,202,1063,4.211822660098522
3397375,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I very much enjoyed this show. Im sad that it wasn't picked up for more seasons. Jill Scott is a great actress, who can pretty much play any role you give her. I visited Ghana for the first time back in 2011, and although this is a different part of Africa as the movie is set in, I will say nostalgia hit me with the jazz clubs, hospitality, vibrant clothes, and how everyone kept calling me a beautiful big mama- I was a size 16 when I went out there, i didn't feel insulted either, because I could tell they weren't being mean but just blunt lol please someone pick this show up and give more seasons!!!",1516492800,,606,4.188034188034188

Jill Scott completely nails the part of Precious Ramotswe in her own way as does Anika Noni Rose as Grace Makutsi.  They really did bring the characters and setting to life here.  What a treat for lovers of Alexander McCall Smith's book series!!  It's a shame this never survived beyond one season.

I had started the book series via a few different book clubs many years ago when this author was a hot and fresh book club read... re-watching this has now made me want to revisit the book series!

3397381,2,B0016Q2D1Q,"Really liked the first episode. Enough to watch the second. Won't be watching the third.

It started to lose me when the main character, Precious Ramotswe, tried to squirm out of looking for a man's lost dog, obviously feeling it was ""beneath her,"" in spite of the man's money being as good as any other client's, and the dog being just as important as any other missing individual.

The dog was found (no thanks to Ramotswe, who abandoned the search when she found a woman lamenting over a missing human, a case she thought worthy of her). Then, instead of immediately returning the dog to his guardian, who not only paid good money to have him returned, but who had every right to have him back immediately, this woman TIED HIM TO A STAKE AS BAIT FOR A CROCODILE.

Think it can't get worse? Think again. She then MURDERED the crocodile in order to sift through his stomach contents for evidence of the missing man.

I love the supporting roles; the mechanic, the hairdresser, and especially the secretary, who just cracks me up.

But I can't put up with a main character whose personality is polluted with such ignorant, arrogant anthropocentrism.",1510963200,,1149,4.696517412935323

3397412,1,B0016Q2D1Q,"Having started reading the series many, many years ago I looked forward to watching it as a series. However, I was very disappointed. Mma Ramotswe was way too young and fashionable, too carefree. Totally without the gravitas of the woman in the books who had suffered through so much. And she seemed to be pining for her ex husband, who in the books was a brutal, horribly abusive man. The sets looked like sets, everything was contrived and nothing rang true to the books with the exception of the wonderful actress playing Mma Makutsi. The scene in the bar where Precious is trying to catch the philandering husband was repugnant.",1498435200,,632,4.754545454545455

3397414,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I knew from the opening credits that this would be an exceptional adaptation of this fine piece of literature. The reason was that the late Anthony Minghalla's name was listed as the director. In the past few decades I have seen UK tv show after tv show unfold with his name as the writer, director or both on the credits. Then I saw his name appear on movie credits as the same. Then he won the Oscar and other awards for his films. He was a huge talent and everything he touched was high quality. He never ever made one of these truly dumb films that are anchored at the average movie theater today.  It was thus a terrible loss when he contracted a head-neck cancer and died in hospital shortly after his surgery. He was only in his 50s. We should have had many more years of his work to enjoy. But at least we got what we did.

I have read all 17 of the books. I loved the books. I thought it would be quite a feat to match the books. He matched them perfectly. The two major figures in the books, Precious and Grace, virtually walk straight out of the book pages and into the tv show. There is no higher compliment.

Precious is the woman in her later 30s who opens her detective agency in Botswana. Grace is the women in her early 20s whom she hires as her secretary. Grace has ambitions far in excess of her secretarial role, however, both in the books and the show. The two of them make a heck of a pairing.

One advantage the tv show has over the books is that we can see and hear the culture of Botswana. The ceremonial dances and singing are included in the program. We have an African style funeral shortly after the show opens. I was fascinated to see all of this as it was too far outside of my own experience to imagine.

Another huge asset is that Botswana is a black culture. The people there in Botswana, where Precious and Grace are doing business, are all black. We never need to get into a plot concerning whites vs. blacks because everyone is black. In America, it is just about impossible to make a movie with a large black cast which does not involve racism from whites being a big part of the plot. It can get really depressing. There is nothing depressing about this show. It is all a delight.",1492128000,,2219,4.248815165876778

The worst thing about it is that there is only one season of this upbeat, non-violent, insightful show.",1396224000,,432,4.2682926829268295
3397879,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"This film series of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is outstanding! Though it takes certain liberties with the original story by Alexander McCall Smith, changing the plot a little and adding a character here and there, the end product is not only not objectionable, it is wonderful. The main characters, Mma Remotsue, Mma Makutsi and Rra Maketone, are beautifully and unforgettably performed. One would wish that a little interview with Smith be appended, telling how he came to write the stories. From the brief biography of the author on the fly leaf of the books, it seems that Smith lived for many years in Botswana, but returned to his native Scotland where he now teaches law. Through these wonderful episodes the viewer feels as if he has touched the soul of Africa and come to love Botswana; a whole new world opens before our eyes. It is sad that for some reason production of the series has not continued beyond the first seven or so episodes.",1396224000,10,956,4.730538922155689

The writing is excellent in that the characters are so easily conjured in my mind.

I loved all of the characters and their acting, but Jill Scott was amazing.  I had to Google her to make sure this was the same Jill Scott, the singer.  It was if the character was her naturally. I'm so sorry that there was only one season.  I wish that some media company sees the value even at this late date and picks it up and develops more seasons.  Hopefully they would do a better job of publicizing this excellent production.  I read the book and had no idea that the series had run.

Not since the X-Files has a TV series on DVD had such an annoying set-up.  There is no ""play all"" option, and you must cycle through several menus to play each episode - and to get to the next episode.
If, like me, you enjoy watching shows several episodes at a time, it is annoying to have to click through options and make four or five choices before you can watch the next episode.

Originally, I was introduced to Mme Ramotswe and some of the other player through an episode on AFN TV while stationed in Japan a few years ago.  Recently, I rediscovered the series in our local library, where books were available for 10 cents-among them 'The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection'...I became a proud holder of a library card and proceeded to check out the whole series.  After reading the first five books, I thought it would be nice to also see the dvds, I checked out the complete 1st Season on DVD.  I am so disappointed and will write the author.  I have heard of poetic license, but this borders on the ridiculous.  I understand that things on TV must be presented in some very different ways in order to appeal to the audience.  However, some of these cases and occurences are so jumbled up, who had said or done what-the only thing I can recognize are the names and locations.  If you have not read any of the books, this might well do-it is how I got interested after all.  If you like the books, don't bother exposing yourself to this as it will appear utter garbage.  This should be called something different as it bears little resemblance and is really only very loosely based-and I am being generous-on the characters and occurences in the series of the same name.",1391040000,4,1341,4.5041322314049586

This later (more current times) acted to introduce the element of organized crime and dangerous situations for the players in these stories.

And because I have been on safari to Botswana, the culture, scenery and wildlife is a huge bonus.  I've found the series keeps on getting better and better as the characters develop -- I just finished disc 2 in the first season.  One of the all time greats.

The ladies are good but there is something just not right with the actor cast as Mr. JLB Matekoni.  The stories are true to the books in a large degree with some liberties taken.  I didn't like the pilot very much but then got into the following episodes.

The biggest problem for me is the stereotypically flamboyant gay hairdresser character that was added to the show.  I am annoyed every time he is on screen.  He adds nothing to the stories, so there can be only one reason he was added--to make sure the show has the appropriate tolerance and diversity quotient for a modern TV series.  In addition, in the pilot, we see a school teacher teaching his students his principles of tolerance rather than math or science.  Ick! The books are about kindness and decency in human relationships, but they are not paeans to tolerance as perceived in our politically correct world today.  In that respect, the spirit of the books has been spoiled in the TV series.",1379635200,,1111,4.401960784313726

My husband and grand daughter found it ""slow"", but I enjoyed the slow relaxing series, brew a cuppa and enjoy this. Makes a great gift to any female over the age of 35, just my opinion.

The female is a young woman who inherits some of her father's cows. She sells them and opens a detective agency in a tiny town where NOTHING ever happens needing a detective...or so it seems......in her all man's world of Botswana, here is a woman to deal with, as she keeps all of her values and femininity while proving that a woman with a brain can make a difference in her community and at the same time, she keeps you glued to see what happens next.

I was not certain that americans would be able to translate the original atmosphere of Alexander McCall Smith books. Im addition I had also heard about the controversy following the decision to give the role of Precious Ramotswe to an afro-american actress rather than to an african actress. I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised by the first episode and that pleasant surprise was confirmed when I watched other episodes. Eventhough it is not absolutely conform to the book and the purists might object, I believe it is a good introduction to the world of Precious Ramotswe and her beloved country, Botswana, and should give viewers envy to look at the other episodes of the serie. All the actors are good but special Kuddos to Jill Scott who is doing a superbe job. She does not seem out of place with the rest of the cast, which I believe are mostly from southern africa. I strongly recommend that serie for Alexander McCall Smith fans as well as for people who know nothing about Precious Ramotswe but are curious of social relations in traditional rural Africa",1357689600,3,1340,4.658227848101266

The mechanic was a heavy kind of goofy character in the show where as in the book, he's thin and pretty sure of himself. Also, what's up with the hair dresser/salon owner in the tv series? Not a character from the books.

I loved the costumes in the show. Botswana fabric patterns are amazing.  I enjoyed seeing Botswana and the people. I mostly like the actors but fitting the whole first book into one episode, sort of took some of the magic out of the story. Too rushed.

HBO never officially canceled this show, and on the website HBO treats it like it's still on hiatus, but I doubt they'll ever be any more episodes made.  I think the death of Anthony Minghella is responsible for that.

I just love seeing Botswana on this show.  All the actors are good too, but the most fun is sitting back and feeling like you are in Africa watching this.

I just love it.

Anika Noni Ross is HILARIOUS too.

If I ever had a wish, it would be that they could at least come back with a movie version.  It's just so much fun and I so wish we could go back and revisit these characters!",1341532800,2,695,4.0962962962962965

Second, the acting fooled us!  I had no doubt that the main characters were all from Africa; their accents seemed so authentic to me. As it turned out, two of the actresses were from America, one from Connecticut!  The bottom line is that every person in the film did a great job portraying a different culture as well as different personalities, while outwitting the requisite bad guys.  The difference between this and so many others in this  genre is that the story line is permeated with African homespun common sense, compassion, and a sometimes zany, usually witty, sense of humor.  It's just a fun, top quality series that our whole family enjoyed.",1336176000,3,832,4.689655172413793

I love this series, the setting, the characters, the story lines (although a touch predictable), everything!  It's sweet and endearing, after every show I just ""feel good"".  I'm so sad that, so far, there isn't going to be a season two...if HBO only knew this is the only time that I have EVER bought a television series on DVD!  I look forward to trying out the books I'm sure they are equally as good if not better.

3398067,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"The stories were beautifully rendered.
And, until I looked up the principal actors, I thought they were all Africans.
Nope. Americans with excellent dialect and movement coaches.
You really DO want to watch the additional material about the making of these episodes and meet the people behind this film.

I have read (actually listened) the (audio) books. Which, in the case of these stories is even better than reading them. (Lisette Lecat, the reader, does a wonderful job with the Botsawanan words. Lovely to hear. http://www.amazon.com/The-No-Ladies-Detective-Agency/dp/1402545355/mywishlistA )
I absolutely loved these videos.
Stories with gentleness, forgiving and understanding - along with a bit of mystery, daring, boldness and determination.

This is the only season. There may be no others.
Two of the principals who produced it both died - within a few months of each other (one young, one old). How odd.

I dearly hope someone picks this project up and continues - with the same actors.",1334620800,2,999,5.350318471337579
3398068,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Not surprisingly there are a few differences from the book, but it's okay.  For the most part they don't take away from the original and in some cases add a bit of fun - such as the hair dresser next door.  For the most part you know the characters when you see them.  I did not see this when it was was on HBO, after watching I'm surprised I hadn't heard of it.  Perhaps it's too fresh and clean to have been popular.  A movie you can watch with your 3 year old child, your 93 year old grandmother and everyone can enjoy it.  Readers of the books will recognize the cases, with perhaps a few changes, but the heart of the stories are there and that is mostly what The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is all about - heart.

The one thing I did not like is that Note Makoti (the ex husband) was in these stories a bit more - or at least his memory, Mma Ramotswe played his records regularly.  She did get rid of him in the last episode - in a similar fashion as the book.  I am happy they did that, otherwise, I would not purchase the second season.  In my opinion he was an unnecessary downer.

Also, I would have liked to have seen the orphanage play a bigger part in the stories as it does in the book, but, it is difficult to do it all and they have done a fine job with the series.

I thought all the actors did an excellent job portraying their character, as I mentioned earlier, you could tell who the character was when you first saw them.

I don't recall any foul language in any of the episodes, no bare bodies, no fights, not that life is rosey, but respectable.  In the last episode there is a touch of domestic abuse when Note grabs Precious, but there was no hitting, in the same episode we see a packet (drugs) but no actual mention of them.  When Mma Ramotswe says goodbye to Note, she gives him money and says ""for this"" - pointing to his horn, ""not for that"" pointing to the packet.  So a parent might want to preview the last episode or at least be there when it is watched , perhaps a good opening for a discussion on both domestic abuse and drugs.

I guess there is one more thing I need to mention.  The books dealt with AIDS without actually mentioning the disease, but there is no doubt as to what all the sickness and orphan children are about.  So, there shouldn't be any surprise that the hair dresser next door is a gay man.  (Perhaps I should mention this was in the early years of AIDS, when it was thought only Haitians and Gay men could get the disease}

I really liked this, I would recommend it to anyone and I am going to get the second season.

I hope you enjoy it!",1334102400,4,2599,4.1252485089463224

3398074,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"When I first started reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books, it took me a while to slow down to their gentle pace. Once I did, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the books and the world they took me to. It's not that bad things don't happen, it's that the way of dealing with the slings and arrows is calmer, or certainly the pace is more measured.

This BBC/HBO collaberation series is the same. At first I was thinking, hmmm, this is a little slow. But then, as I kept watching it, I realized that it isn't really slow, it is calm. Your office is ransacked - the way to deal with it isn't to run around accusing people. You observe and you wait. It's actually pretty Sherlock Holmes-y in that way.

The acting is excellent. The scripts are intelligent. The humor is great. When Precious Ramotswe hires a secretary, the efficient and prickly Grace Makutsi, she also needs a typewriter for said secretary. The resourceful JLB Matekoni brings in two manual typewriters. Each one has keys that don't work, but they are different keys. Later, the determined Grace explains how she can word her reports to get around the missing keys. And then we see her typing a report on one machine, taking the paper out and inserting it into the second machine, and resume typing, using only words the 2nd machine can type without misses. It takes longer to explain than it does to watch and appreciate.

The ""mysteries"" Precious solves are varied and interesting. No bodies, which is true of the books, too. But just because there aren't bodies in these mysteries, doesn't mean they don't need solving.

The feel of the series is very similar to ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" films, and that's not surprising, as ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" are supposed to take place in Botswana, also. However, the films were mainly filmed in South Africa, while ""The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency"" was actually filmed in Botswana.

In this DVD set, you get the feature-length pilot (109 minutes), originally aired in the U.S. in 2009, and six one-hour epiosodes. The quality of the series is a reflection of the people who created it. For example, Anthony Minghella (1996 Oscar for Best Director of ""The English Patient"") directed and co-produced the pilot. Minghella said this about filming in Botswana: ""Particularly fascinating to me was working and filming in an African country where old and new are currently coexisting, where traditional values have not yet been eroded by the demands and efficiencies and neuroses of the modern. It was a privilege to be working on a film which celebrates what we can learn from Africa, and not what we think we can teach it.""

Unfortunately, the U.S. ratings were poor, and HBO did not renew the series for a 2nd season. So this is all we get, and that is a shame.

The wonderful acting and characterizations of the players, especially singer Jill Scott as Mma Ramotswe and Dreamgirls' Anika Noni Rose as Mma Makutsi, bring the characters from the book to life in the most delightful way possible.  The music, especially that which plays at the beginning of each episode, seeps into your pores and lifts your heart.  And Africa herself (at least Botswana) is featured well.

Each episode manages to delicately balance humor with drama and explore the characters personally while still presenting interesting light mysteries.  If you can sit through one episode and not laugh at the hilariously uptight Mma Makutsi, you need a tune-up on your funny bone! :)

The only downside is that there was apparently only one season...or at least I've only been able to find one season available on DVD.  What a shame.  I will miss that cast of characters terribly.

They aren't anything that I would have chosen on my own, I know nothing about and have never been even remotely interested in Botswana, but once I started reading, I couldn't stop! I had to have every single one of them and finished them at a rate of one per day.

If I had turned on this video or seen a promo for it on TV, I would have passed on it. It takes time to ""warm up"" to the personalities and their surroundings, even though the actors are superb!

I had bought the video thinking I wouldn't like the books and watching it would be better (and faster). I could then tell my friend who sent me the books that I had enjoyed the series, but not tell her that I didn't read them all. It didn't work out that way. I LOVED reading the books!

So far I've only watched the first episode on the video. The problem is, I had only read 3 or 4 of the books at the time I got the video, and most of the images on the screen were much different from what I had visualized in my head while I was reading. I wanted to get the books solidly in my head first before seeing an interpretation of it from someone else.

I did watch enough to know that some of video series was spot on and a few things were even better than I had ""seen"" in my mind. I stopped watching because I had ordered the rest of the series in book form and wanted to enjoy those before I ""ruined"" them by watching what someone else had visualized. Now I have given it a couple of weeks and I am ready to see another interpretation or version of these great books that I never thought I would want to read. Now I can get excited about the video, because ...there are no more books left for me to read until he writes a new one.

Was interesting to see the pretty close match to written story but was very put off by ""over the top"" portrayal of Mme's newly hired secretary. This personality is not even close to the key role of the endearing young woman in the book to the point where I am seriously considering not watching more episodes. The ""so called ""gay"" character addition was also not necessary but I guess ""That's Hollywood"" or Network TV for you.

This is way too good for TV . . . everything about the production shouts excellence and it must have cost a fortune. No wonder they aren't sure if they'll be doing a second season. It really is too classy and expensive for TV; the acting, photography, on location filming -- even the little animated drawings on the menu are great.

No, it doesn't follow the books exactly; there are some new characters and the storylines borrow from several books at once. However, none of that was jarring like film adaptations usually are. The whole series flows really well. I also really enjoyed the focus on the interpersonal relationships in the series. It compliments the books by adding more depth to the characters.

My mother was familiar with singer Jill Scott's appearances on the Oprah show, so she was thrilled to see she could act. What carries this series is the cast, tremendous actors from the hairdresser to the auto mechanic, as well as the secretary who is also a junior detective in her own right.

The actors who play Mma Rmotswe and Mma Makutsi are excellent in their portrayals as well. Though the actors are slightly younger and prettier that what I imagined the characters to be, that is the fault of my imagination, not the production.  I loved the Botswana locations, the use of real Africans in the supporting roles and the use of native dialects on occasion.  It is a fun series and faithful adaptation for the most part.  The part I take exception to is the addition of the stereotypical homosexual hairdresser as a regular character.  He does not appear in the books and, though his character adds an additional dash of humor, I feel that the addition of his character caused the series creators to diminish the roles of Mr. JLB Matekoni's apprentices.  One could always count on the immature, slacker apprentices to add a little hilarity to each book but they only rarely appear in this production.

3398164,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"... is truly what you get when watching this series!

So many other reviewers have described this TV-series so well. So I won't write another review like that, but rather share my feelings after having seen all 7 episodes included on this DVD on TV.

This sure is a type of series rare today. Sure, I love many Hollywood series, but not only is this not one, it is totally different. I have not read the books, only watched the series as it has been televised in Norway this summer. But I have loved each and every minute of it. Actually, I have even watched every episode twice, first on the day it has been televised, then replayed it a few days later together with a visitor. There aren't many series I would have done that with! Most TV series aren't of a kind that I could watch twice in a week!

This series is just different. It has so much warmth. It even has something as rare today as real politeness and etiquette, but served to us in a charming and humourous way, if I may put it that way. The characters are played in a way where you might at first think that they are ""overplaying"", but you soon discover how it is just perfect! I wouldn't have it any other way, the way they act in this series is just 100% (not 97%! ;) ) correct in this context. It is one of the many things that give the series the abundance of charm that it has!

I have had the pleasure of visiting 4 African countries, and watching this made me remember so many little things I experienced there. So even if it is dramatized like it is, it really feels authentic too. The series shows some of the sad things that happens to us human beings as well as tough and sad sides of Africa, e.g. that so many suffer from HIV/Aids, but this sure is no sad series as one might think, maybe Africans have a way of handling hardship with humour in a way that is rare for most of us? Well, if some place on this earth qualifies better for something like that, it would be no surprise if it was Africa, if you know what I mean? And that is one of the things that is so charming with this series, that they manage to incorporate so many serious subjects (there's always some moral to the episode), giving us a little reminder of this and that, all while making us smile and chuckle, and watch in suspense too. The characters, especially Mma Ramotswe, also show so much compassion for other people. She often uses her own tough experiences in her work as a detective. Losing a child and having had an abusive husband, is something that helps her in her meetings with [potential] clients. She is not just a tough detective, but rather an empathic and warm one - and very humble too. She's not one to brag about her accomplishments, she's quite a modest woman, but she might do a little victory dance (when we're not watching) together with her secretary (and later Assisting Detective) Mma Matekoni a.k.a. Miss 97% from The Secretarial College of Botswana... ;)

This series have some fantastic characters, I think, and the actors really play them well too, with a lot of heart, you might say. You soon come to feel quite fond of these characters and I sure did not want the series to end. The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it is only 7 episodes. I wish there had been 70, so that even if this season was over, I had much to look forward to.

I sure hope that somebody will pick this up and continue the series. With all these books, there must be a lot to use... :)

Happy watching, Mma & Rra! :)",1280880000,,3484,4.277693474962064

For anyone who is into African culture, and just love a good storyline, this is a series to watch.  I hope they come back for a second season.",1278720000,,272,3.909090909090909
3398174,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I'd heard a lot of good things about the series, but had not been able to see it on TV.  The original price was too steep for me and when I bought it at a discounted rate it still felt a little pricey.  Then I watched the first episode. Wow! Worth every penny. Well written, well acted, beautifully appropriate wardrobes, breath-taking scenery.  Unbelievable!!!  Just the opportunity to see some of African life is worth the price.  As the series moves along you find out a little more about what makes each character tick.  Precious (Jill Scott)- a woman who had a close relationship with her father. A good man. Her relationship with Note, her talented, abusive ex-husband. Her blossoming relationship with LJB, owner of a automobile mechanics shop. Her growing friendship with her sometimes strange, but complicated secretary Grace (played wonderfully quirky by Anika Noni Rose)and of course we can't forget BK, the very wise and observant hair dresser. The African actors made gave this an authentic feel.

If you are tired of seeing cookie cutter TV shows, give this one a try.  You won't be sorry.

I truly hope that there will be additional seasons.",1278201600,5,1156,4.857142857142857
3398175,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"The series is certainly worth a watch. According to my wife, the episodes ares very close in tone and story to the books.

I thought they could have made a little more of Precious' skills in observation and sleuthing. After an opening event where she showed some wisdom in solving a theft, and then used good observation and intuition to tell her driver much about himself, the rest of the story sort of devolved into coincidence to help her solve the remaining cases.

The mysteries are quite interesting though, even the mystery of a little lost dog. Much more engrossing and meaningful is that of a missing young man, and that of a feuding family that may do each other in unless Precious can work her magic at their estate.

You'll find the characters to be indeed charming, and the setting is very far from the norm, giving this show a unique flavor you won't find elsewhere.",1277856000,,880,4.592356687898089

I watched them all over a weekend and I really enjoyed them, but as I have read all the books, it is hard to give a review without a bias towards the books.  If you haven't read the books, you will probably enjoy the series, yet it is for those into feel good and senitmental themes.  It can seem slow, but be patient, Ma Ramotswe (main character) gets there in the end, as she does with the books.  They have had to change the story from the books especially when revealing the back story of the main character/s.  It's wonderful how they filmed in Botswana (where the books are set) and it is shot beautifully.  Main criticism, is that there were some subtleties in the book, that were lost in the series, it did feel a little Americanised, for eg. how some of the stories ended and declarations of love, which seem to be a fixture in American series, as opposed to British series.  This as a great gift for any fan of the books as well as for your mother or mother in-law.  For all its strengths and weaknesses, it sits proudly along side the books of the series.

3398180,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"Alexander McCall Smith's book series by the same title has enchanted millions worldwide.  Now the HBO Series of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency brings to life the books for all to enjoy.  Seeing Mma Ramotswe, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and Mma Makutsi on TV and in the DVD series gives an added depth of character in each of them.  Now in reading the book we can actually picture them and hear them speaking.  Actually filming the series in Botswana truly captures the reality of life there.  I think we all would love to pack up and move to Gabarone as a result of this wonderful series of books and now the TV series.

Kudos to HBO for bringing this series to America.  It had to take some courage to get away from other HBO series such as ""Sex in the City"", ""The Sopranos"", etc., and bring such a wholesome series that nearly the whole family could enjoy watching.  I only hope and pray that those who filmed the original series will see themselves producing more shows of the ""No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"".  They left us with a bit of a cliffhanger in the last show.

This is a really enjoyable series, the characters are wonderful and richly acted and the story lines are superb.  It was truly fun to sit with my wife and watch these shows together.  No violence in the shows, no language you needed to beep out, just really excellent acting and fantastic productions.  The only thing that bothers me is the cliffhanger ending of the last episode.

In writing a review, normally I would write a little of the plot and a brief personal opinion, but for this review, I am just full of opinion.  I thought the HBO production totally outstanding.  The casting was superb. The choice of site locations was excellent.  They may not have stuck exactly to book order, but all the scenes were from the book.  Everything was exactly as I pictured, from the written word of Alexander McCall-Smith.  I have logged on hoping to find a Season 2.  I look forward to more DVDs.  I hope Mr. Smith keeps writing and writing.  Sometimes a series grows 'tired', but not so here.  Each episode left me interested to know more of the characters in the story.

Jill Scott and the other cast members were perfect choices for the characters in the book.  While the series veers a little from the story line it is pretty much true to the books.

Jill Scott's Mra Ratmotse is full of common sense, love, and sense of justice as in the books.  I found that I loved Matkusi even more than the characters in the books. I understand now that with no theater tradition in Botswana, african actors were very hard to find.  I am looking forward to another season.",1264809600,,452,4.421686746987952

My mother and her friends have enjoyed the HBO series based on Alexander McCall's books very much, so I purchased this DVD for my mother-in-law, who has not told me one way or another whether she likes the video.

Mma Potokwane and the orphan farm, Mma Makutsi's shoes getting subtle camera shots, 42% Violet Sapotho...they're all there.  I don't know if they built the house on Zebra Drive used in the shot, but it's EXACTLY as it should be, right down to the plantings.  So is the shopping mall, the hospital...the garage apprentices...everything.  There is one additional supporting character, but he's fine!  No problem.  Every deviation from the books is subtle, and ends up working out even better.  Some of the mysteries are direct from the books, others are not.  An utterly GLORIOUS series I hope will run for many years to come.  There is no way you can go wrong with this.",1264464000,,844,4.839160839160839

Alexander McCall Smith must be commended for honoring the Precious Ramotswes of Africa. When I read the books, I thought that I know this wonderful woman, and could not understand why her story had never been told. Jill Scott is a great choice for the principal character, and I keep pinching myself about how perfectly she got the accent and the mannerisms. She is also a wonderful singer who projects warmth and love in her performances.",1264118400,,540,4.635416666666667

3398232,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"This is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV.  When I watched the first episode of N1LDA, I almost fainted--Jill Scott, a phenomenal ACTRESS (who knew?), paid close attention to her voice coach and fairly channels Precious Ramotswe.  Anika Noni Rose is fantastic as the proud yet endearing Grace Makutsi.  The director and actors captured exactly the feel, the tenor, of the wonderful series of books by Alexander McCall Smith.  From the beautiful cinematography to the whimsical animation in the credits, this is a splendid production.  The show is pitch-perfect.  Anyone out there who enjoyed the books should not miss this series on DVD.  Now for a bit of negativity:  I think it's been cancelled on HBO and I'm not surprised.  When I viewed the first episode of N1LDA, I knew I was watching something different.  I also knew that because it was different, it was doomed.  It is so unlike anything remotely resembling the commercial pap to which we viewers are usually subjected.  The sweet innocence and generosity of spirit possessed by McCall Smith's characters as they grapple with everything from life's little annoyances to serious issues are antithetical to an industry that feeds on insecurity and superficiality.  N1LDA has no gratuitous profanity, no lurid sex scenes, no fart jokes.  The show never stood a chance.  I respect the risk HBO took and I commend them for giving this a try.  I urge them to bring N1LDA back for a second season, and hope they will explore other stories of this quality.",1263945600,3,1518,4.87109375

The interpretation of McCall Smith's books is a bit different from the written word, but nothing is compromised.  The story flows well and the characters are engaging.

She now understands why I've been greeting her with the phrase ""dumelle ma"" (spelling?). Jill Scott and Anika Noni Rose are quite believable; Rose really showcases the breadth of her acting skills and comedic abilities.

3398249,4,B0016Q2D1Q,"The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books are among my all-time favorites. So, naturally, I was looking forward to seeing the filmed version. As might be expected, I was both pleased and disappointed. The disappointments stemmed from the departures from Smith's books. Usually, when books are adapted for screen certain changes must be made in order to adjust to a visual medium. However, the changes which were made to Smith's books were not only unnecessary, they detracted from both the overall spirit as well as the intent of Smith's series.

The addition of a new character--the hairdresser--was particularly distracting. He was out of keeping with the original stories, and contributed nothing to the plots. I got the feeling that the hairdresser was a means of ""updating"" the series.  However, the stories really don't need modernizing. Part of their appeal is that they reflect old-fashioned values--honesty, integrity and national pride. The rather lengthy exposition of Precious Ramotswe's back story was also problematic. It slowed the pace, and added material that was inconsequential. (Smith handled the revelation of Mma Ramotswe's past in the best manner possible--as the stories unfolded--and the screenplay should have stuck with that.) But the biggest problem with the adaptation was the virtual elimination of Smith's gentle ironic humor. In the absence of irony, the screenplay was forced to become more melodramatic than was originally intended. The focus on ""solving mysteries "" and catching ""bad guys"" (who were much ""badder"" than their original counterparts) not only added an element of cliche, but diminished the charm of Mma Ramotswe's encounters.

On the positive side, the acting was generally very good. Some of the characters really came to life, especially J.L.B. Matekoni and Grace Makutsi. Lucien Msamati did a wonderful job as the shy mechanic, conveying an unusual depth of emotion and sensitivity. Anika Noni Rose also did a superb job as Mma Ramotswe's secretary, Miss 97%. Her timing and comic sense puts her at the top of her class as a comedienne (at least 97%). The only real disappointment among the actors was Jill Scott, who did not have sufficient heft (in spite of being traditionally built) to pull off Precious Ramotswe's strength of character, wisdom and unassailable dignity.

The best part of this series, for me, was the opportunity to see and hear Botswana. I was reminded that not only was Africa the birthplace of humanity, but of music and dance as well. To witness the joyous spirit of Africa was a real treat, and not one that I will soon forget.",1261008000,23,2603,5.1465721040189125

While not true to every one of McCall Smith's books, this production is completely faithful to their spirit. Jill Scott IS Mma Ramotswe and Anika Noni Rose is most assuredly Mma Makutsi. These ladies are acting their asses off, as is the fellow playing Mr. JLB Matakoni. This is just superb acting by people who have internalized these characters.

Great series, it follows the spirit of the book quite well but adds a little humor. Grace is haughtier than ever and Anika Noni Rose pulls her off admirably. Mr. JLB Matekoni actually looks as I would have expected.

I like how the series doesn't interfere with the books. Mostly, I don't recall the plots of the first books, so it's all new to me.",1256428800,,697,4.3538461538461535

3398284,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"As a big fan of the book series, I was somewhat reluctant to watch this series. Too often, good books don't translate into film -- particularly into television series! But despite my trepidation, I bought season one and I have to tell you -- IT IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY.

No, it's NOT a literal transcription of the books but it does remain fairly true to the plotlines and ""spirit"" of the original books. None of the minor changes hurts the story and a few of the changes -- like new characters -- actually add to it.

When critiquing books and shows, one of my criteria is whether or not I like the characters. After all, I'll be spending several hours (at least) with them. I wouldn't spend time with a loud, nasty or vulgar neighbor so why would I spend time with characters I don't like? Based on this one criterion, this show is a real winner. I liked ALL of the ""regulars"" -- Precious, and Grace and JLB, and BK -- and would gladly have dinner with any of them!

I can't possibly list everything I liked about the series, but I will point out a few highlights:

CASTING -- is perfection itself. I was worried that they would make Precious less of a ""traditionally built"" woman to fit the common TV star mold (young, thin and vapid) but Jill Scott is a true beautiful fatty (not as fatty as I am, but she can be forgiven that one flaw). She's a bit younger than I thought she was  in the books (I seem to remember reading that Mma was in her late 30s or early 40s?) but Scott's depiction is so true to character that it didn't bother me in the least. The other main characters are equally ideally cast with particularly kudos to the actors who play JLB Matakone and Mma Makutsi. Absolute gems one and all!

WRITING -- the writing is funny but never slapstick, poignant without being maudlin, and always very natural -- the way people speak, not the way writers write.

CINEMATOGRAPHY -- short of going to Botswana, I can't think of a better way to view this sometimes stark but always intriguing country. The shots are as good as you'll see in any first rate movie and almost never see in television series.

In short, I simply adore this show. It's the best thing I've watched in years (decades?) and I hope it goes on and on and on and on...",1255478400,6,2248,4.348448687350835

I was thrilled to learn the TV series is out on DVD.  What a well done film.  Each episode is true to the novels. The scenes are beautifully filmed with perfect lighting, and the actors are outstanding.  Jill Scott as Mma Ramotswe, and Anika Noni Rose as Grace Makutski are played exactly like the characters in the novels.  You love them immediately, and of course Grace is hilarious with her opinions and forthright attitude.  The film really draws you in to life in Botswana and the folks that live in Garborone.  I love the uplifting African music which is a lovely background for the series and I hope a CD becomes available from it. Like the books, the village life is simple with dirt streets and chickens walking into shops. There are wonderful characters like Wellington and the hairdresser who add to the whole feel of life in Garborone.  I borrowed the DVD as soon as my local library bought it, and there's a waiting list for this DVD already. I look forward to season 2 and more, please.",1255046400,3,1177,4.3963133640553

3398294,5,B0016Q2D1Q,"I was enchanted when I read the first book in the series and have read each one as it came out.  The TV series is also wonderful and  Each episode is similar to the books, in that Mma Ramotswe works on several cases at once and, of course, always gets the answer in a way that rewards the good and punishes the bad.  Along the way, the viewer is treated to the sights and sounds of Botswana that reflect Precious' views of her country as the finest place on earth.  The series has been updated from the original - #5 Zebra Drive and the agency office are still modest, but grander than the description in the books - no dirt floors.  Yet chickens still try to enter the premises during business hours. There are some characters who help the story modernize but the charming feeling that permeates the books also permeates the series.  I bought the series and will also recommend it to my public library.",1254441600,6,903,4.409638554216867

The wonderful voice of the South African female narrator will take you far into the beautiful, successful, democratic, and thriving country of Botswana and its people and creates a place I sincerely hope to see someday.

The acting here is pretty good...the film moves right along, and although it isn't faithful to the story, its certainly good enough in its own right.",1254268800,17,470,4.650602409638554

It is so well done, with fabulous acting on everyone's part - Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi and JLB Matekoni all turned out as I imagined them. A male (white) writer telling the story of a female (African) woman with as much love as he does is amazing enough as it is, and the creators of the TV series did a great job bringing the characters to life. One can only hope that the The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency will finally give Botswana and its people the attention they deserve. Unfortunately it seems like the majority of people today prefer mindless entertainment (judging by the number of highly praised but awful or stupid movies I have watched over the past years) - otherwise this would have been great cinema material.

I felt the effeminate gay hairdresser added nothing to the series. Not only is he a clich but the actor who plays the part consistently overacts the role. It is especially painful in the first two episodes. Did the writers feel this is a chick-flick series and that the addition of a gay hairdresser added comic relief?

On the positive side, the acting by the principle actors is very good and it was fun to see the country of Botswana which is exotic and beautiful.

This series also seemed a bit over priced with only seven episodes for $40. The books are far better but if you have never read the books you may enjoy this series.",1253491200,36,758,4.4855072463768115

It gives you the much needed ensemble cast that is always popular for a television series.  The books are wonderful, but the HBO brought series to life. Jill Scott is is the #1 Lady in this house.  She is Precious Ramotswe and I can never imagine anyone else playing the role.  The stories hold true to the books, and Precious provides that little bit of morality that is missing today.  I DVR'd the series and have re-watched it dozens of times, even my husband is beginning to know it by heart, but I am still waiting impatiently for my copy of the DVD.

Even the hateful maid is perfect, as much as I want to dislike her, but knowing MaRomotswe she will not win the fight! The two mechanic boys are so cute and the boss is so lovable and good, the little orphan boy Wellington is soooo cute and adorable.

Instead, there are several open cases, and several personal problems whose story lines interweave.  McCall-Smith digresses constantly to muse about life in general and life in Botswana in particular a country he obviously loves and will make you love. Television stories are usually more straightforward and I was apprehensive about a television series spoiling the books and misleading a new audience about the nature of the books. I needn't have worried. Even though they changed many details and even added new characters, the shows convey the reverence for life, the love for Botswana, and the life lessons inherent in each of the small and large cases the detective agency investigates.
