7373598,3,B013U8EMXY,"This isn't the best Christmas movie youll ever see but its also not the worst. The humor can be quite stale at times in this family friendly Christmas comedy. There are some moments that will make you smile or maybe even laugh. Danny DeVito saves the movie, without him this movie would have been in serious trouble. Youll hope for a good performance from Matthew Broderick but unfortunately you won't find it. When its all said and done this one is more for the kids, with the wannabe Home Alone type stunts and stupid humor. Also for a family friendly movie there are a few weird parts of this movie that are not exactly the most kid friendly such as the Sherriff being a cross dresser, among other things that seem out of place. In the end, its a decent Christmas movie, don't go out of you way to watch it but if you find it in on a streaming service or TV,  give it a watch.",1513123200,,879,4.263473053892215
