8416792,5,B0045L0HOE,"This dvd is split up into two 30 minute videos.  The first is feeder fishing on commercial waters.  The second is using the method feeder.  Being from the states, I'm not going to be fishing for many of the same species that British anglers are.  However the knowledge can be used for all species that feed on the bottom, especially catfish.  European anglers are as knowledgable at fishing with baits from the bank as Americans are at fishing with lures from a boat for bass.  If you have an interest in bettering your bank fishing, videos like this can help.  And if you're wondering about purchasing fishing tackle and bait like what's used in the video, there are websites that focus on carp fishing (here in the U.S.) that sell a full range of products.

One last note, since this DVD is designed to be viewed in Europe, my dvd player won't recognize the format.  I have to watch it on my computer (dvd-rom).  I think there are newer dvd players that will play it, but I don't know for sure.",1317600000,,996,4.45303867403315
