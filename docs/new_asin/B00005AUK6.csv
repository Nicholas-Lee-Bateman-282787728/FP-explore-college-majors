1418589,3,B00005AUK6,"Although I enjoy most of the Frankie and Annette beach movies I doubt I would give any of them a rating of more than 4 stars.  In the case of BEACH BLANKET BINGO (BBB) I could only give it 3 stars.  It and BIKINI BEACH are probably my two favorite beach movies.  Each of these were made towards the middle of this series of movies and by that time fans of the movies had grown to recognize most of the characters in the films and the stories seemed to move better.
I gave stars because BBB did well with the relationships between Frankie & Dee Dee and with Bonehead & Lorelei.  I especially enjoyed seeing the Bonehead character get a little more attention in this film.  He is in most, if not all, of the beach movies and deserved a little more screen time.  I also enjoyed Paul Lynde as Bullets.  Nobody does snide or sarcastic as well as Paul Lynde.
I deducted stars because BBB did not bring back Candy Johnson, the girl who was always dancing during the previous movies (she usually danced during the end credits of the earlier movies).  Also, Little Stevie Wonder did not return for this movie, he had been in two prior beach movies.  As for the DVD edition of this film I deducted stars because as others have mentioned this version did not include the song ""I'll never Change Him.""  I also thought the DVD could have used some special features other than just the original trailer.  Heck, most of the actors in this film are still alive and are in their 50's or 60's.  I would have thought some of them would have been up for an interview.  The director William Asher is still around, I see him every once in a while on shows such as ""The 'E' True Hollywood story.""
All in all this is a good film.  I would have given it 4 stars if the DVD had been a little better developed.",1004745600,9,1783,4.2835820895522385
1418590,4,B00005AUK6,"Wonderful, crisp transfer-finally you can pitch those horrible EP VHS copies!  Robert is right about the missing song, so I had to dock it a star, but a must in any case!",994377600,,170,4.3125
1418591,3,B00005AUK6,"Serious collectors hoping for the ""definitive"" version of this beach classic, please be forewarned: MGM has inexplicably released the ""edited for television"" version rather than the original theatrical version! What a disappointment!  It seems that years ago when ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" was shown on ABC, the network cut out a solo sung by Annette titled ""I'll Never Change Him"" to allow for more commercial time.  When HBO released its VHS version, it was also the edited version and in fact, subsequent reissues by Goodtimes Video and Video Treasures apparently used the same print.  It wasn't until a couple of years ago when the movie started showing on cable networks such as Cinemax and American Movie Classics that the restored theatrical version finally was seen and for those of us who weren't lucky enough to see it on the big screen, it was quite a surprise that we had been watching an edited version all these years. The song is a bouncy upbeat tune and in my opinion, it's Annette's best song in the series.  In fact, it was even recycled later the same year in ""Ski Party"" with the title and lyrics slightly changed to ""We'll Never Change 'em"" and this time warbled by Deborah Walley. On the upside, the transfer is crisp and the colors breathtaking in this widescreen edition. But if you want to see the original theatrical version, you'll just have to be content to tape it the next time it plays on AMC's American Pop series.",992822400,36,1442,4.756
1418592,5,B00005AUK6,"Beach Blanket Bingo is the best of AIP's Beach Party films.  Unlike the other films in the series, there are actual attempts at some clever tongue and cheek writing here, Annette finally displays some of here phenomenal  body, Frankie actually has a tan, and the supporting cast is much better  this time around.  Here we have Harvey Lembeck as Erick Von Zipper (what a  great character!), Linda Evans, Marta Kristen, John Ashley, Buster Keaton,  Don Rickles and the great, demented, Timothy Carey.
Director William  Asher had Roger Corman's Poe movie cinematographer Floyd Crosby on this  film, making it the best looking of the series.  The color is rich, the  compositions dynamic and the camera more mobile than usual, giving the film  a greater sense of excitement.
Finally, series composer Les Baxter also  had a bigger hand in writing and arranging the songs this time around, and  they are much better than usual for this series -- the title tune is a  standout.

And we're talking bad scratches that show up between the actors eyes on close ups (!). It is obvious there was no remastering done for this edition and the print actually looks inferior to the one used for the DVD version. This edition is still missing the song ""I'll Never Change Him"" as well, which is interesting that this song is repeatedly not restored for these home versions, as the melody is used thematically in the score. This comes from Olive Films, which i'be never heard of before, but also still bears an MGM logo and production tag. I guess I had higher hopes for this release. it's nice that they're releasing some of these older movies for a High Def medium, but please, make it worth the upgrade.",1424217600,9,919,4.476190476190476

The famous ""I'll Never Change Him"" sequence was intact and made this then-teen boy fall in love with Dee Dee, sorry, Frankie. Then it was repeated and in 1971 our pre-Fox indie showed it. AMC AM Pop showed it in the 90s as well. When I recently borrowed a 2001 library, the sequence is strangely missing. Please reissue this movie even if MGM makes *that* sequence a bonus feature. Our beach darling is ill with MS and she would deserve a commemorative edition in her honor, even if Messrs. Ashley, Lembeck and Asher and Ms. Walley are deceased.

1418642,3,B00005AUK6,"I really expected to love this movie. First of all, I have a soft spot for mid sixties kitsch, and it was made in 1965--the year when hair, clothing, toys, cars, furniture, TV shows and music were all at a peak. I even like Annette Funicello (Frankie Avalon I can take or leave).

The central problem with BBB is it's not funny. Not only is it not funny, but it's really UNfunny. Almost unbelievably unfunny. Frankie and Annette have some star quality and some chemistry, after a fashion, but the rest of the cast, except for the awful overacting of the Zipper Gang (painful to behold) are bland and lackluster. A young Linda Evans is especially dull as ""Sugar Kane"", a young singer (whose voice is surely dubbed).

The screenplay sounds like some MGM executives issued the directive ""we need another beach vehicle for Frankie and Annette. Throw in a lot of music and dancing, girls in bikinis, and whacky hijinx. And we need it by tomorrow morning.""

The music is another fatal flaw, for outside of the infectious opening theme, it lacks a single good song. There's a lot of music in the movie--how is it they couldn't come up with more catchy tunes? A strong soundtrack would have really elevated the movie's appeal and compensated greatly for its other faults.

But not nearly as much as a better screenplay with at least one honest laugh!

Awful, yet quintessential, this is worthwhile mostly as a time capsule, or for hardcore Frankie & Annette enthusiasts only! But I'd rather be a monkey's uncle than watch it again!",1262736000,2,1523,4.689138576779026

You definitely don't need to be an early baby boomer to enjoy these movies.  My disappointment is that the song ""I'll Never Change Him"" is missing.  It is the underlying theme music throughout the entire movie, but we never get to hear Annette sing it.  I originally taped the movie off of AMC a few years back, and I was so disappointed when this song was missing from the DVD.

Earl Wilson: I thought this place only allowed humans.

Bone head: they're the Peace Corps rejects.

1418647,4,B00005AUK6,"It's clear to see why ""Beach BLanket Bingo"" might've been a hit among the teens of the day.  It's zesty, frothy and fun, and keeps a beat going musically.  One of the biggest highlights is the beautiful Donna Loren singing ""It Only Hurts When I Cry.""  She was a talent on the line of Dusty Springfield if ever there was one, and why she didn't become bigger (or remain known today) as a singing star is mystifying.  Apparently she wasn't well managed and the proper due wasn't given to her recordings, but she certainly had star material and the pipes. It's also fun to see a very young Linda Evans, looking as if the false eyelashes are a little too much for those baby blues, and Marta Krystal (I believe is her name), an actress who starred as ""Judy"" on ""Lost in Space,"" playing a mermaid.
The thing that drags the whole thing down from sheer stupidity in my opinion is Harvey Lembeck as ""Eric Von Zipper,"" doing a Brando take-off with annoyingly dumb and adolescent wit.  Whenever he and his ""rat pack"" are on the screen, I fast forward, although evidently he was somewhat of a hit because this character appeared in several ""beach"" films.  I always enjoyed the way that slapstick 60's flicks would feature older stars like, in this case, Buster Keaton, giving this older legends their due and a chance to appear among the popular young stars.  The guest star appearances are fun.
As for Annette and Frankie, that crooning Italian duo -- Frankie Avalon was one of those baby-faced, handsome, smooth-voiced singers that came out of Philadelphia, so I'm sure he was a heart throb at the time, and he was cute with Annette. Their on-screen relationship was sweet and light. Annette Funicello was really a gorgeous girl and such a likeable personality on film.  Her popularity was well-deserved, because along with being a knockout and having a pleasant if not outstanding voice, she was just a fun and super nice human being.  No one who worked with her ever has anything bad to say about her and that's certainly refreshing.
Another fun star of that period was the pretty Deborah Walley.  She did her own surfing in the films and she also played in a Gidget movie.
In sum, you can't go wrong with this trip into the beach flicks of the 60's.  They're a light way to pass the time and a window into the period.  Dig the dancing!  (I think people are actually doing the ""Frug!"")",1069804800,7,2378,4.580188679245283

1418650,3,B00005AUK6,"""Beach Blanket Bingo,"" ""Bikini Beach"" and ""Beach Party.""  Most people when asked to name a beach movie, immediately refer to this Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello '60s trilogy ( I don't include the affshoot ""Muscle Beach"" flick as part of this authentic ouvre).

In 1963's ""Beach Party"" Annette went by the name Doris (an homage to Doris Day?).  The plots, I use the term loosely, were almost interchangeable -- mostly surf, sand, rock 'n roll and sex -- well, mostly innicent tease really.  What's most remembered is the hope -- false as it turned out -- that the voluptuous Annette would reveal a tad more skin.  And then there's Bob Cummongs in a patently false beard, Harvey Lembeck as the hyper and astonishingly old juvenile delinquent Eric Von Zipper. And of course the tassled Candy Johnson shaking her bikini'd booty over, or is it under, the credits.

In ""Bikini Beach"" Annette is now Dee Dee (must be an homage to Sandra Dee) and Frankie stretches his chops by playing two roles.  He is his standard sex-crazed surfer guy and also the gap toothed  (a nod toward Terry Thomas?) Brit singer potato Bug -- apparently a spoof on the Beatles (remember, this is 1964).  A drag race is part of the action and there's an ape that surfs.

""Beach Blanket Bingo"" what a great title) is probably the best of the bunch.  The dialogue is almost witty. And of course there's the great stone faced silent clown Buster keaton doing his timeless bits of busines.  (A burned out alcoholic's sad, haunting and poignant farewell to the genius of his youth.)  Don Rickles gets a major break with a part that sealed his antagonistic comic persona.  Annette show a little more flesh and Frankie has a tan.  The rear projection surf shots are still laughable but the over-all photography is much better.  Les Baxter's score is full of energy and the title tune is actually memorable and fun.",1022544000,7,1881,4.723926380368098
