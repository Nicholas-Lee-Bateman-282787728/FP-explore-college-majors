8345768,5,B001V9ASK6,"I have a copy of this video and I highly recommend it.  It goes over how to climb on skis, getting up from a fall, snow plow, stem christie, fall line, and advanced skiing.  It also goes into how to stay in shape for skiing and how to dress to stay warm on the slopes along with much more.  I would highly recommend it for the beginner skier.  Yes, some of the clothing and equipment are dated since it was made in 1986, but the information is basically the same.  I watch this video periodically for review of the basic skills.",1326758400,,528,4.188118811881188
8345769,3,B001V9ASK6,"Movie is on VHS. A bit dated but the basics are basically the same. Funny to watch the old school clothing.
Again pay attention to the instruction and video makes sense.
Highly recommend before sending someone who never skied a day.",1296172800,,232,4.682926829268292
