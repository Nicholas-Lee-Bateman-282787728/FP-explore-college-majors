7947204,5,B00005NG0K,"At first,i gat this masterpiece from ma brother as a birthday present, tho' it was on vhs.a close friend borrowed it and he won't return it! Hence, I decided to roll to AMAZON;this time i purchased the dvd fomat. Dam! See,the diff btw Boyziimen and anyother is that they sing music not just songs.
I am a singer/song writer myself and voices like those of the philly brothers don't come by any means cheap. The blend of their delicious harmony brings laughter to a dyin' heart. In North Korea, the weather is cold and freezin still their voices is nothin but pure bliss. Uhhh oh.
I adore them to that extent where i have every album and possess every selection that ever came out. As a matter of fact, i own a spanish version of ""I'll make luv ii u$QThey inspire my musical career every day that passes by.
Therefore, i must stress that even if, this dvd cost $50,i won't vacillate to have it as part of my selection.hey, are u still readin this, u should be on ur way to the store right now....and hey, go to AMAZON because u won't find it at HMV!",1078012800,,1048,4.324873096446701
7947205,5,B00005NG0K,i've always been a fan since the early days. i'd bought all the albums etc... and saw this advertised in dvd magazine. of course i bought it!! what can i say? being a musician/vocalist myself these guys really make me sick! there harmonies and awareness of each other is frightening. all the favourites fom all the albums sang acoustic in seoul with the mountains as a backdrop and the snow on the ground. these boys are the undisputed kings of close harmony vocal. a great buy even for non boyz 2 men fans. buy it now!,1027814400,,519,4.416666666666667
7947206,1,B00005NG0K,if you want to LOSE you're money buy this DVD,1018656000,,45,3.6
7947207,5,B00005NG0K,"This much-anticipated DVD finally arrived to my house last night, and it completely blew me away. As an aspiring R&B singer, I look to Boyz II Men as one of my main influences. The presentation is wonderful, and the vocals, despite Mike's absence, are simply heavenly, especially on a jam-session-style improvisation of ""Never Go Away"". Their candid interviews bring insight into many facets of the lives and careers of one of the most talented vocal groups ever. If you like good music, I strongly recommend this item.",1014681600,,519,4.977011494252873
7947208,4,B00005NG0K,The boyz prove once again that they are the best group EVER! their vocal talent is shown here in a all new light thanx to the acoustic renditions here!  only a few quibbles though; poor Mike wasn't there (not his fault) and they did not sing On Bended Knee (properly anyway) and I'll Make Love To You. All in all fantastic. Worth every penny.,1012089600,,342,4.34375
7947209,5,B00005NG0K,"As usual Boyz II Men shine through in this live performance.  You find out REALLY quickly how good a singer/musician is when you take away the acoustics, lights,  and fancy things and toss the artist out there there with almost nothing.  They are AMAZING.  They are missing Mike whos voice was unable to make it, but they still sound great. I was waiting for this special to come out so PICK IT UP!!!",1000598400,,400,4.438356164383562
