8137300,5,B000H7G1T0,This is a movie set during WWII at a transit Air Base in Eastern Siberia. Its a movie that touches a person's heart at the end of it. The acting is great and the story evolves beautifully. Has lot of humour both overt and subtle. But the end is like that of a thriller. I think its better with the english subtitles as the original tones of the Russian speakers would be lost with dubbing.,1159315200,4,389,4.2
