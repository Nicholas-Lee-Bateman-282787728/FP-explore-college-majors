The singing is not that great and there is much shouting in the singing.
The production is not very interesting.",1496707200,,211,4.578947368421052

8582590,5,B00CJIBBVS,"I have reviewed this DVD back in 2013 for the WholeNote Magazine of Toronto. Canada.  This is a reprint of that review which is under copyright of The WholeNote Media, Toronto:
It is to the credit of Mozarts greatest opera to be able to endure many different viewpoints, from traditional to the wildest modern interpretations. Ive even seen one that took place in South Bronx with an all-black cast and it was marvellous. Here the Don Juan legend, or morality tale is from the hand of a young, very talented Russian director Dmitri Tchernakov  with a well thought out and imaginative concept that infuses the action, setting, characters into the last detail. That the Concept puts the drama in modern setting:  a drawing room of a luxurious residence of a dysfunctional family is quite immaterial. It really is all about a man trying to live above the rules of society and although he is successful for a while, ultimately doomed.

To achieve this, the Director, who knows the score and libretto by heart and therefore no bumbling dilettante, selected his singing actors with utmost care, mostly young with fine voices and remarkably fit to live up to his strenuous physical, emotional demands. The dissolute
Don, Danish baritone Bo Skovhus is a, larger than life presence, alternatively charming, elegant, seductive, insolent, despondent or manic you name it, although the superhuman demands do take their toll and his powerful voice is sometimes off pitch. The three women representing three social classes and of different ages, are all memorable, each with their own issues, but common in one respect: their uncontrollable, conscious or subliminal attraction to the Don. I was most impressed by the ingnue, exceptional Swedish soprano Kerstin Avemo giving a simply unforgettable, many layered emotional,heartbreakingly empathetic portrayal of Zerlina.
Under the enthusiastic, firm musical leadership of French conductor Louis Langree driving his virtuoso period instrument Orchestra with verve and brisk tempi, the show moves along seamlessly and its refreshing like the Provence air.

8582591,5,B00CJIBBVS,"I was entranced with this version of the opera.  This DG is radically different and complex than the usual cad we see in most versions of the opera.  I won't argue authenticity and all that; but I was intrigued at how a 200-year old opera could speak to today's decadence.  I love opera but I'm not a technical/artistic critic whose judgment would carry any weight, but I will enjoy watching this again and again (along with my moire traditional dvd's of DG).",1387843200,10,459,4.573170731707317
8582592,4,B00CJIBBVS,Great singing and acting. True theatre. VERY Clever use of minimal staging. All the leads are outstanding. THE 21st century DG,1386201600,5,126,5.0476190476190474
