3687667,3,B001LMUYUW,"Adventures in Booga Booga Land is a children's DVD from Tommy Nelson Publishers.  It's a collection of 3 short stories illustrating Bible stories.  The stories are told through the 2 main characters, Gerard the giraffe and Marty the monkey.  The 3 stories on this volume are the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard, the Parable of the House on Rock or Sand, and the Parable of Hiding a Lamp Under a Basket.

I watched this DVD with my 3 year old daughter.  She enjoyed the stories and the characters.  However, my wife and I did not.  The stories were good, but we had difficulty in pulling the Bible message out of them.  Our hope was that we would be able to use this DVD as a teaching time.  It didn't work for us.  Still, my daughter enjoyed it and we had a great family time.

3687668,4,B001LMUYUW,"The DVD industry has come a long way with cartoons especially in the religious market. This DVD is cute. The characters are lovable and easy to relate to, the stories are easy to follow and the pace is fast moving. The graphics most of the time were fairly up to date for a cartoon. I thought the story lines were good and portrayed the various parables quite well. However, the ending of the stories left a little bit to be desired as far as an explanation. I thought they could have taken a moment at the end to ""debrief"" to make sure the parable really sticks in the minds of children. Otherwise, I thought it was great! Glad to hear they intend to make more episodes covering more parables in the near future. On a side note, the ancillary products that accompany the dvd's as far as plush, etc. are ADORABLE. Great additions to this series.",1286236800,,845,4.423076923076923
3687669,4,B001LMUYUW,"I liked this video.  My kids (7, 10 and 11) thought it was good.  Overall, I'd give it a ""4"" as I think the only thing that's missing is an explanation of the parable just a bit?  In trying to set up the stories, the plots get a bit convoluted and then the kids don't really get the parable connection -- particularly in the third story, the plot lost the point of that particular parable.

This dvd includes 3 stories based on the Parables in the Gospel of Matthew:
1.  The workers in the vineyard (Matt 20:1-6)
2.  The wise and foolish builders (Matt 7:24-27)
3.  The lamp under the bowl (Matt 5:14-16)

The animation in this one is good -- much better than I've seen lately with kids' cartoons (especially since so many are relying on computer graphics which always look ... funny!).  The sound is good (except the woman in one sounded like a man trying to be a woman???)  The music is great -- not grating on my nerves and the kids liked it.

Overall I think this is a great DVD to watch with your kids.  A great teachable moment when each episode is done!

3687670,4,B001LMUYUW,"Adventures in Booga Booga Land is a ""dvd based on Richard Milnar's beloved allegories."" Each dvd corresponds with a parable from the Bible. This dvd has a total of 3 episodes:
1. So this is Booga (The Workers in the Vineyard, Matthew 20:1-16).
2. Marty's Sandcastle (The Wise and Foolish Builders, Matthew 7:24-27).
3. No Light in the Lighthouse (The Lamp under the Bowl, Matthew 5:14-16).

The main characters are: Marty, a oney; and Gerard, a giraffe. My 3 year old was glued to the tv while this was on, and the 2 year old lasted for almost one whole episode before running away. (Each episode is about 15 minutes long).

I actually didn't mind this dvd, the animation wasn't bad and the music was pretty good. We have one set of Christian cartoons that drive me crazy because all the voices are done by one man, and you can tell they were all done by one man- very poorly. Thankfully this dvd isn't that way. There are some cartoons that are so annoying that I don't want to even be in the room, but this one I'm ok to be on the computer, doing homework or laundry in the same room.

As for the story line, they did a good job basing it off of the barables. I felt the ending of episode one just dropped off and could have used a better conclusion. But this IS a kids cartoon, and they are way less pickier than adults. :) Overall, this makes a great cartoon for litle kids.

Based on the Parables of Jesus, join Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe as they bungle their way thru the paradise of Booga Booga Land inadvertently learning lessons that Jesus taught many years ago.

So This is Booga: Marty and Gerard meet for the first time in the city of Booga Booga, becoming instant best friends. Early one morning they decide to become window washers for a day to earn 20 bamolies. But when they see the boss also give 20 bamolies the other works who arrived late in the day, Martya and Gerard want to know why. (Based on the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard from Matthew 20:1-16)

Marty's Sandcastle Marty and Gerard decide to go to carpentry school, taught by the German instructor Mr. Guudsaw. After graduating, they each decide to build their own home. But one night a great storm destroys Marty's flimsy house. (Based on the Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders from Luke 06:47-49)

No Light In This Lighthouse: Marty gets a bright idea to build a lighthouse, but ends up rushing the job when he sees that there are ships being lost while he works! (Based on the Parable of the Lamp Under the Bowl from Matthew 5:14-16)

My Thoughts:  This is an enjoyable video with a message that not only entertains toddlers and elementary school age kids but makes for quality family time.  The videos are a wonderful interpretation of the parables and would make a great addition to any family video library or even the Sunday School library.",1286150400,,1532,4.634686346863469
3687672,4,B001LMUYUW,"ADVENTURES IN BOOGABOOGA LAND is the story about a giraffe named Gerard and a monkey named Marty who met when Marty fell out of an airplane. The two became friends and start looking for a job together.

There are three episodes on this DVD, based on three parables.

1. ""So This is Booga"" is based on ""The Workers in the Vineyard"" (Matt. 20: 1-16) where Gerard and Mary meet and get hired on as window washers.

2. ""Marty's Sandcastle"" is based on ""The Wise and Foolish Builders"" (Matt. 7: 24-27) and is about them taking a construction class, then each building their own house.

3. ""No Light in the Lighthouse"" is about ""The Lamp Under the Bowl"" (Matt. 5:14-16) and is about the two friends building a lighthouse.

Children will be enthralled by this loveable pair as they do some pretty funny things to reach their goal. Marty is kind of immature and Gerard is the voice of reason, but between the two of them they are really funny.

If you are looking for a good DVD that is based on biblical parables, then ADVENTURES IN BOOGABOOGA LAND is the DVD to consider. It is so loosely based that you can show this DVD in the world and no one will be offended by the Bible teachings, yet the stories are similar enough that children will come away with the same truths.

My five-year-old says that the DVD is wonderful. My eight-year-old says that some of it is unrealistic. (But then, what cartoon is?) This DVD is good for the preschool set.",1285891200,,1440,4.473282442748092

The parables of the Bible are sometimes hard for younger kids to understand. These are really great cartoon skits!

At first my oldest daughter (13) was like ""Awww Mom, do I really have to watch these?""

Of course, mommy said YES. ;-)

What's so great is she decided she liked the disc and now wants to get another product from the company: They have a new ""All Star"" 20 Disc set of the top young actors of today reading the Bible. It also comes on a flash drive bracelet. Really cool.

Anyway... back to Booga Booga Land...

The girls and I really loved the informative little cartoons. We laughed together then grabbed our Bibles to read the scriptures that each video was portraying. We spent 30 minutes discussing the 3 little cartoons on this DVD.

I highly recommend these discs for kids of all ages... but they are probably more geared towards kids ranging from Toddler to about 3rd grade.

3687684,4,B001LMUYUW,"Thanks to (booksneeze.com) I was given the privilege of  reviewing the dvd ""Adventures in Booga Booga Land - Volume 1"" the DVD by Richard Milner. This cartoon series allows you to follow the friendship of Marty the monkey and Gerard the Giraffe while sharing their adventures with the parables of Jesus. The three parables that were shown were: Episode 1 The Workers in the Vineyard.,Episode 2 The Wise and Foolish Builders and Episode 3 The Lamp under The Bowl.  Each of these parables were cute and I believe for anyone under the age of 10 that they make learning effective and fun.

I watched this DVD with my three nieces (4,6,8) and they seemed to enjoy it. I thought it was quite cute, but just not for someone my age. Each parable really got you thinking and Im sure that they learned quite alot in the 45 minutes. The graphics were good and it was quite colorful so I am sure that it helped to keep their attention. Overall I think Milner did a great job and I would recommend this DVD. It totally served it's purpose and it kept with the biblical principle so I would give it a 4.5/5

The three short episodes portray three different parables of Jesus (The Workers in the Vineyard, The Wise and Foolish Builders, and The Lamp under the Bowl).  The stories were cute but seemed very vague for the small children to understand.  They might be great starting points for conversation with your children after reading the Bible passage and watching the video.  However, I think that by the time my children are really old enough to fully understand the passages and see the parallel with the video story Marty and Gerard will be of no interest to them.

This is a DVD we'll take in the car with us for longer trips. It will break up the movies since they don't have to pay attention for a long time.

This children's animated show has three episodes in which we watch Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe play out three parables.  The parables covered are: Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard from Matthew 20:1-16; Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders from Luke 06:47-49; and Parable of the Lamp Under the Bowl from Matthew 5:14-16.

We were not impressed with this video as far as Biblical content.  It seemed very watered down and although I understand that the intended audience is quite young I wish there was more than 2 minutes of Bible explanation.  The animation is ok but not great.  The colors are bright.  My 18 month old was somewhat interested, but this was not a big winner in our household.  We would not recommend this DVD to another family.

3687688,4,B001LMUYUW,"It is difficult to find a DVD of any genre, particularly children's programs, that is both interesting and appropriate.  I was curious to see how this one measured up, and was pleased to find that it did very well.  My 7 and 10 year old actively watched, and even my teenager didn't just roll his eyes and leave the room (which is saying a lot these days!).

Adventures in Booga Booga Land is a new DVD series based on the adventures of Gerard the Giraffe and Marty the Monkey.  This DVD contains 3 episodes, each based on a different parable from the book of Matthew in the Bible (The Workers in the Vineyard, The Wise and Foolish Builders, and The Lamp Under the Bowl).  While not specifically addressing the actual stories from Scripture (they are referenced at the beginning of each episode), they set up the stories well and provide a good avenue for family discussions about what Jesus was trying to teach.  This is exactly what happened with us after we watched, and they boys retained both the DVD story and parable days later.
The animation was bright and colorful, with sound effects and constant action.  There was quite a bit of cartoon violence (falling, shooting through the air, etc.) that was very mild, which may be of concern for some families.  We all enjoyed it, and have watched it numerous times.

3687689,2,B001LMUYUW,"Marty (a monkey) and Gerard (a giraffe) are best friends and live in Booga Booga Land. The adventures they get into are all based on Jesus' parables, which makes this DVD more appealing to parents who want their kids to be exposed to the truth of the Bible. This particular collection has three episodes, based on the workers in the vineyard, the wise and foolish builders, and the lamp under the bowl.

I had high hopes that this would be a great DVD to use both at home and at church. And as I watched it with my children, I was surprised to see that they enjoyed it. We all laughed during the episodes, though the kids laughed at more parts than I did. In fact, they even asked to watch it again. So I can say, as a parent, that this is a DVD your children will probably enjoy. But, in terms of the connection to the parables I felt that some of it was a stretch. It was definitely a new and creative method of teaching on the parables.

I would not recommend buying this DVD, but if you can borrow it you should.

Overall, as a parent I enjoyed this DVD. The two main characters, Gerard and Marty, were cute, and they made each story humorous in just the right places. The parables the stories were based on were easily recognizable. My children are 3 1/2 and 2 years old, and the DVD did not quite catch and keep their attention. Instead they would watch bits and pieces while they played. Based on that observation, I would say that the DVD would be more for an elementary aged child. I will definitely save this DVD, so my children can enjoy it when they are a bit older, because I love the fact that it teaches stories from the Bible.

3687691,2,B001LMUYUW,"You never know what you're going to get with kids videos. Sometimes they surprise you; they're packed with great content and have terrific production quality. Sometimes they're okay, but forgettable. And then there are the ones that are an absolute train wreck--mind-numbingly painful to watch and just awful, awful production values.

(I'm not sure if that's the best opening for a review, but there you have it.)

Recently I received a copy of Adventures in Booga Booga Land, distributed by Tommy Nelson (Thomas Nelson's children's product division). Based on Richard Milner's children's book, the DVD features three stories that serve as retellings of Jesus' parables & teaching: The workers in the Vineyard from Matt 20:1-16, The Wise & Foolish Builders from Matt. 7:24-27 and The Lamp under the Bowl from Matt. 5:14-16.

So, how did it fare? Well...

The stories on the DVD really only serve as a lead-in for parents to have a discussion of the biblical teaching. This can be a good and bad thing. On the one hand, it's great to have something to call your kids back to as in, ""remember when Marty and Gerard got all huffy because their boss paid people who started working at the end of the day the same wage as them? Well, let's take a look at that story in the Bible..."" So in that sense, it's a helpful learning aid. On the other hand, if you don't always have time to do a full lesson with your kids and need something that has a more ""complete"" message, you'll want to look elsewhere.

Another concern that came up was that the stories themselves are surprisingly violent; my daughter was very confused and concerned when Marty the Monkey and the Schwarzenegger-styled adult education teacher were fighting in the grocery store. Additionally, the attempts to recall fond memories of classic Looney Toons shorts fall flat; it just doesn't work.

The production quality of the cartoons is terrible. My wife commented that it looks like it might have been done by the same people who made ""Toopy and Binoo"" (one of the strangest kids shows we've ever seen). Truthfully, it reminded me a bit of a bad Flash video.

The final thing I have to comment on is the voiceover work. The voices just grated on us adults. Gerard reminded my wife of Canadian author and radio personality Stuart McLean (it wasn't, we checked). And the pseudo-Canadian bus driver... Really? We're still doing that? (There's another level of irony to this in that the government of Ontario receives a credit for playing a role in the production of the video.)

All that to say, while this certainly wasn't the worst kids video I've seen and I greatly appreciate the intent, Adventures in Booga Booga Land is not something that will be a fixture in our home and I wouldn't recommend it become on in your's either.

This DVD covers the parables of the workers in the vineyards, the wise and foolish builders, and the lanp under a bowl.
What I liked, the DVD cover gives you the scripture verses for each parable so you can direct children to the Bible for discussions.  While I know the parables and may have been able to point them to a book, I would have had to search for chapter and verse.
The parables are retellings, with characters doing every day things that my children recognize.  The characters and situations engaged my 2 year old and she very much enjoyed watching them.
What I don't like, Marty is disrespectful (calls someone a cheapskate in the first parable, refers to shop teacher in another episode by saying ""I know where to find a 'square'), impetuous and in my opinion not a good role model.  He doesn't really have ""ah-ha"" moments in which the viewer can obviously see that he has learned a lesson about how his behaviour/actions were wrong.  For me, Marty is a huge turn off.  Young children are very quick to imitate what they see and hear and I don't want my daughter imitating Marty!
I won't buy any of the other adventures (if released for sale) for my daughter to watch.  I feel like the premise is good, the setting is good, the parables are great, but Marty needs to either be more respectful or show some remorse!

3687693,2,B001LMUYUW,"This is a children's DVD that ""cartoons"" three of the Parables of Jesus.  Because it is a children's DVD - and it came from a Christian company I trusted, I decided to let my three kids (ages 10, 8 and 21 months) watch it without me the first time (we watched it again, together).

My sons really enjoyed it, however it didn't capture the attention of my daughter (and she does actually watch TV at her age - she's the youngest).  When I watched it with them, I was highly disappointed.  Chalk it up to the total awesomeness of VeggieTales, but I have come to expect Christian Children's DVDs to tell a story, be of high quality and be watchable by parents & children together.

This DVD fell short.  Marty the Monkey (one of the main characters) reminded me more of a character you would see on secular Saturday morning cartoons - lots of cartoon violence, getting in trouble and general disrespect for the other characters.  Which led to my boys wrestling around and acting like the monkey (no lamps were harmed in the watching of this program - but just barely).  Monkey see - monkey do.

The Biblical lessons weren't overly clear to kids (and I have pretty smart kids), and while I'm all for DVDs being conversation starters (we've had some great ones after a VeggieTale), I still want my kids to GET IT from the DVD.  The quality wasn't up to the standards I expect either, but it was a good start (something that might come as the series takes off and more DVDs come out).

Overall, I might buy a second DVD if I ever saw them on sale, but if there was a VeggieTale I didn't have nearby, I would pass this over without a problem.

This DVD follows Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe through 3 parables:
1. Parable of the workers
2. Parable of the wise and foolish builders
3. Parable of the light under the bowl

First, my two nieces loved it. They watched it twice in a row, however I had some concerns with the stories.
As you progress through the 3 parables, they loose their focus. The first parable was cute and made it's point well.
The second point made its point but followed more the main stream TV in that it's animations was centered around violence. Marty was continually getting in trouble, making fun or hurting their instructor.
The final parable I do not see how it ties into the parable at all.

It was a cute and entertaining video but failed at its intent of teaching the parables.

Because of the violent actions of Marty in the second parable and the total miss with the last parable; I give this a 2 and  1/2 stars out of 5.

Getting Olivia to learn more about the Biblical Parables is always an adventure. If you ask her a question then she can give you the answer without having to really think about it.

""Booga Booga Land"" is a really cute DVD that includes 3 episodes and 3 Parables from the Bible. I really like the 2nd episode and the parable because it is based off of Matthew 7:24-27 which happens to be the parable about The wise and Foolish Builders. But the whole DVD is really cute. On the days that either Olivia is sick or we just can't seem to get moving fast enough on Sunday mornings to head to church we either turn it onto the church network through our satellite company or we watch a movie. This movie has been a huge success in our household because with the learning that Olivia loves to get; it's been successful in learning more about Jesus, the parables and just overall having a great experience with it.

The one thing that I love is the fact that this dvd makes it fun and exciting about learning about the Bible.

3687706,3,B001LMUYUW,"""Adventures in Booga Booga Land"" is a fairly cute kids' cartoon. This DVD includes three short, (15 minute) episodes about a giraffe named Gerard and a monkey named Marty who come to Booga Booga Land and become best friends.

Each of the three episodes is based on one of the parables that Jesus tells in the New Testament. The first episode is based on The Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16), The Wise and Foolish Builders (Luke 6:47-49) and The Lamp under a bowl (Matthew 5:14-16).

I thought that the first two episodes were pretty well done in terms of script. It was easy to see the parallels between the parables and the antics of Gerard and Marty. However, I don't have any idea why the makers of the DVD chose the Lamp Under the Bowl for the third parable. 1) The actual parable is quite a bit shorter than the others, 2) it's a hard parable to recreate in any tangible sort of way, and 3) the episode felt extremely contrived and it was a bit of a stretch to link it to the parable it was supposed to be based off of. I still can't figure out what the moral of the story was, and I KNOW the answer.

Overall, I give it 3 stars because it was cute, entertaining, and my 2 year old enjoyed it, but it's not one we'll watch over and over again.

Marty and Gerard learn that they are not being 'ripped off' but that their boss is being truly generous to the other workers. Second, the Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders from Luke 06:47-49. Marty plays the part of the foolish man quite well as Gerard plays the part of the Wise man. Lastly, the Parable of the Lamp under the bowl from Matthew 5:14-16.

Each of the parables has a specific purpose but each one is not specifically portrayed in the story. I thought the stories were cute and fun to watch.

One thing I would suggest is that as a parent you need to be involved in the discussion of these parables after they watch them. We had some good discussion about behavior and attitudes portrayed in the DVD.

I hope that the creators of  Boogabooga land come out with more  DVD's filled with parables in which we can have active discussion in our house.

3687708,4,B001LMUYUW,"When I got this Dvd, I hoped it would provide something fun and new for my girls to watch on a recent car trip. I was not disappointed.

I have to be honest. I'm not usually a fan of ""Christian subculture"" movies or cartoons (Veggietales being the major exception). Sometimes it seems that the church is trying to do the same thing as mainstream media, just with a smaller budget. And this Dvd was not high-budget by any means. Truthfully, I don't know if I would have bought this at my local Christian bookstore before viewing it with my girls. But now, I'd absolutely buy another Booga Booga Land video.

Not only does it completely crack up my kiddos (even the 50th time) but it also presents three parables of Jesus in a way they'll understand and remember. However, the application is minimal- it's more of an illustration or a conversation starter for parents. This isn't a complaint, just a disclaimer. It doesn't break things down as well as the previously mentioned cucumber and tomato. But that's what moms are for, right?

This Dvd has three different stories, conveying three different parables: the workers in the vineyard, the wise and foolish builders, and the lamp hidden under a bowl. The main characters, Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe, are likable and funny. The content and music is a little silly, but not overly obnoxious as cartoons go. My only complaint is the cartoon violence- it's a little reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote or Yosemite Sam (Marty is a little accident-prone). For my kids, it is absolutely hilarious, but to me it is a little unnecessary and just a cheap way to keep the laughs coming.

Still, if they are laughing and learning truths from Scripture, I can't complain. And it's MUCH better than Spongebob! Just kidding... sort of.

It is not just like the parables from the bible, not a re-enactment.  Instead it is a completely new story with the same lesson learned.  They present the material in a fun and silly way using a girrafe and monkey.  My kids laughed and laughed through the entire dvd and the stories were simple enough that they were able to understand the point too.

3687710,5,B001LMUYUW,"I was exited to see that mom had a DVD for us to watch after school one day.  I really like the video and so did my 5 year old sister and 2 year old brother.  My older sisters thought they were too old for it.

The DVD has three different stories that have Marty and Gerard in it.  Marty is a not very smart monkey and Gerard is a very smart giraffe.  Mom says the stories each show an example from the Bible.  Like the story about the window washers.

Gerard travels to Booga Booga Land  and he meets Marty.  They decide to team up and find a window washing job.  The man who hires them promises them 20 bambolies for washing the windows.  The next morning they woke really early to start washing the windows.  After a while, they see another window washer.  And a couple hours later another, then another, then another...And Marty thinks it is because they are not working hard enough, so they pick up the pace.  At the end of the day they go to get their pay.  But they find out that the very last man they saw washing windows got the same amount of money they did, even though they worked longer and harder.  They go to the owner and he explains that he paid them what they all agreed on the day before.

After the DVD, mom and I talked about how this is like the story in the Bible about the workers going out into the field.  We also talked about how when we agree on something, and someone gets the same thing, it does not take anything away from us.  This is kinda hard to learn.",1287532800,,1487,4.118466898954704
3687711,4,B001LMUYUW,"My latest acquisition from booksneeze.com is the DVD Adventures In Booga Booga Land.  This DVD is based on the allegories of Richard Milner.  This series follows Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe as they explore Booga Booga Land.  There are three episodes that are based on the parables of Jesus.  The parables presented are the workers in the vineyard, the wise and foolish builders, and the lamp under the bowl.  The DVD is a total of 45 minutes.

My children (ages 7, 4, and 2) helped me do this review by watching the DVD with me.  They really enjoyed the stories.  All of them would laugh and laugh.  The situations that Marty and Gerard are very entertaining, especially for the younger set.  And what I really appreciate is that the DVD is only 45 minutes.  It's just enough to grab their attention, yet they are not sitting around for a long time in front of the television.  As far as parables go, I felt that two of the stories were a little reaching when it came to following the parables but the one about the workers in the vineyard I really felt was a wonderful story.  Overall, this family would recommend Adventures in Booga Booga Land!

3687712,4,B001LMUYUW,"As I was watching Adventures in Booga Booga Land with my two youngest children (ages 5 and 7), I could not help but laugh at the ability of a child to become so engrossed in a cartoon, even when they are unfamiliar characters. This DVD was one I selected to review for my kids and for my church library. The stories on it are from the Parables of Jesus. Basically, there are two main characters, Marty and Gerard who are a monkey and a giraffe. They travel to Booga Booga Land in order to find jobs. Along the way, they have fun, adventure, and a little misadventure. There are other characters who make repeated appearances in the shows also.

Each episode highlights a Parable of Jesus. The parables included in this DVD are ""The Workers in the Vineyard,"" ""The Wise and Foolish Builders,"" and ""The Lamp Under the Bowl."" Each story relates the parables in ways that both my 5 and 7-year-olds understood. They laughed as the animals made silly mistakes. They also seemed to understand what the ""correct"" way of doing things should have been.

I was a little skeptical that my children would enjoy this DVD, especially after being exposed to something as popular as Phineas and Ferb or Sponge Bob, but they really liked it. I asked them if they would like to see more, and they were very enthusiastic about it. I had to admit myself that the cartoon was very cute. I would recommend this for all children probably within the ages of 3-8. It would more than likely be a bit boring for those out of that range.

3687713,1,B001LMUYUW,"In Adventures in Booga Booga Land, we follow Gerard the Giraffe and Marty the monkey as they go through life in Booga Booga Land, living out the parables of Jesus. The first two segments cover the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) and the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders (Matthew 5:24-27). These parts told the parables correctly, but I thought they failed in overall application when they didn't even mention Jesus. The only place it was even mentioned as being from Jesus was in the titles of the segments. If I was a child unable to read, I would have no idea these had anything to do with God or Jesus' teaching.

The final segment, based on the Light of the World/Lamp under a bowl passage in Matthew 5:14-16, just didn't seem to make much sense with regard to what the segment was supposed to be based on. On top of this, the voices for the various characters were nothing unique and the script was lame. Attempts at humor fell flat. Maybe the books are better. As much as I was hoping to like this DVD, I'm not even sure if I would be willing to give it another chance. Farewell, Booga Booga Land.",1287273600,,1136,4.435406698564593

There was no discussion about Bible truths in the movie. We did sit down and talk to my two children (mainly 3 year old since she understands more) and shared the similarities of the movie and the Parable. My 3 year old and 1 year old really liked the movies (the characters were fun, bright, and kept your attention).

I was kinda disappointed that there wasn't a single Bible verse or reinforcement of what these stories meant for them. I also wasn't too impressed with the visuals - it wasn't the best-drawn cartoon. The boys do like the show though and we will be keeping it around, but it just didn't top my list.

3687726,2,B001LMUYUW,"I recently had the chance to review the kids dvd  Adventures in BoogaBooga Land  and have very mixed feeling about it. On one had My 5 year old loved it while I found it  choppy and at times a bit confusing. It starts of and the intro just makes me dizzy its a little overkill if you ask me. If you've ever seen Rocko's Modern life this dvd reminds me of that on Acid or Speed. It focuses on 3 parables the workers in the vineyard.the wise and the foolish builders, and the lamp under the bowl. I'll start with the first to demonstrate the workers in the vineyard  Marty and Gerard( the main charachters) get a job as a window washer and work hard all day long , as the day passes more workers come to help and when it comes pay time  the worker pays them all the same. they get upset because they worked longer then the rest , and he says did you not agree on this pay,is it wrong for me to be generous and pay you all the same. Let me stop here before I go on to say the voices in this is terrible its very bad acting but it's for kiddos so i tried my best to ignore it as annoying as it was. The second parable was the wise and the foolish and  Marty and  Gerrard go to school to learn construction. The teacher has an awful time with marty because hes constantly jumping ahead of his plan and trying to do things hes not learned yet. Eventually they graduate and Marty builds a house on the beach while gerrard builds his on the stone. A storm comes and marty wakes up in bed in the middle of the ocean while gerrard has to save him. It was a good way to get the lesson across I give him props for that. The last one was the parable of the  lamp under a bowl. Let me say Im a preachers kid I know almost all the parables of the bible and I hadn't ever heard of this one.  In this parable marty tried to build a lighthouse and the light keeps going out and a ship sinks this happens like 4 times and finally he fixes it. I had to go to the scripture they tie into this Matt 5:4-16 to get the point to this one and what it was really trying to get  across to the kids. Would I buy this in store ,no. Did my five year old love it,yes! That being said we watch movies together and with the bad voicing and the sparatic intro's this is bnot something i could watch over and over with her. I'd vote veggie tells or gigi over this anyday. Good intenetions bad followthrough!!

I watched this video with my 5 year old daughter and she thought it was okay, but admitted it's not her favorite. I was not impressed with this video.

I didn't find it offensive, but then I don't leave power tools laying around for my daughter to find.

3687732,3,B001LMUYUW,"I recently received Adventures in BoogaBooga Land from Thomas Nelson Publishing (through Booksneeze) for review.  Marty the monkey and Gerard the giraffe take adventure after adventure together, encountering challenges and mishaps of all kinds along the way.  Their adventures are based on 3 parables taught by Jesus, the workers in the vineyard (Matt. 20:1-16), the wise and foolish builders (Matt. 7:24-27), and the lamp under the bowl (Matt 5:14-16).  After watching this DVD with my children, ages 3 (almost 4) and 2, I have mixed thoughts to share regarding the movie.

If you were to ask my children their opinion, I think they would give it great positive reviews.  My children immediately sat down to watch the movie, and have since watched it frequently.  It has fun, catchy music, lots of funny mishaps to laugh at, and silly-looking animals to enjoy.  What's not to like from a kid's perspective?

If you were to ask me or my husband our opinions of the DVD, they would vary slightly from our kids. Having seen so many of the DVDs from the Tommy Nelson Publishing companies, our expectations were a big high.  My immediate thought as the movie started, was that the graphics were similar to that of Cartoon Network's shows, which we do not allow our family to watch.  The storyline with Marty & Gerard were  pictured as a skewed version of Wiley Coyote and Roadrunner, with Marty being the one always getting hurt.  But, putting my graphic dislikes aside, most importantly, I was greatly disappointed with the content in the movie clips.  Typically, my children come away from these type of DVDs with a lesson from the Bible that they can and often do repeat to whomever will listen.  Even after watching this DVD 6+ times, when asked, my daughter (the oldest) still has no idea of any significant lessons that were taught with Marty & Gerard.  To them, it's entertaining, but that's all...and to me, that's not enough.

Obviously, you can see that this wasn't my favorite children's DVD.  There are so many out there that offer a much clearer picture of God's word, I would be hard for me to recommend this one above all others.  However, as I said, they are enjoyed by the kids.  So, if you are looking for a clean cartoon for the kids to enjoy, this may be for you.  But if you are looking for them to walk away with Bible verses or lessons, you may want to keep looking.

3687733,2,B001LMUYUW,"Adventures In Booga Booga Land COULD have been a very cute cartoon and a great resource for teaching your littles the basic understanding of 3 of the great Bible parables.

However, all it had was pure silliness and stupidity. The lessons were lost in the midst of a foolish monkey blowing himself up and doing dangerous things without getting hurt one bit...not something I want my children trying to imitate. Name calling and just plain carelessness seemed to be the theme in this video, not learning about the responsible lessons Jesus taught.
Hubby and I watched the video ourselves before we would let our children see it, just to make sure it was ok for them. I am glad we did, as it wasn't something we wanted our children to see. (Our standards are high.)
I will give it credit though, that the first small cartoon ""So This Is Booga Booga"" wasn't half bad. Not quite as silly and pointless and the lesson was a little easier to catch in there.

But unfortunately, I am sorry to have to give a bad review. The rest of the video was a disappointment. The creators seemed to have spent more time trying to entertain with today's mindlessness for children then sharing God's lessons. We were hoping to be able to use this video with our children as a teaching tool. This just didn't work for us.

The DVD was so unpopular in my house that it was lost. Months later, I've found the DVD and finally finished. It only got worse. The second episode ""Marty's Sandcastle"" was WAY more violent than the first. And while the storyline fit with the parable, they never really landed the ending and the meaning that it conveys. The third episode, ""No Light in The Lighthouse"" doesn't even line up with the scripture that it is supposed to represent.

Marty and Gerard are very likable characters and the animation is very colorful.  I can see children under the age of 6 getting bored with the stories though.  I think the storylines are best suited for 6-8 year olds, but the animation is aimed at children younger than 6.

I almost thought the 45-minute DVD was never going to get watched - 45 minutes can be a long time for a child to sit still. But the stories were actually cut into three segments that were less than 15 minutes each. They featured silly animals that made the story really easy to understand.

These stories made the parables so easy to understand, but the stories were not dumbed down at all. I would recommend this series to other parents.

8318719,1,B001LMUYUW,"First for the good news:  My 6 year old daughter and 3 1/2 year old son said they ""liked"" the 3 episode DVD of Booga Booga Land.

The bad news far outweighs the good:

- First off the sound volume was a little messed up and I had to turn the volume way up to hear it.
- In all three of the episodes there was no mention of Jesus or God and the Biblical allegories that were promoted and advertised on the front and back of the DVD were very unclear.
-The animation of this DVD was ok, but definitely not of high quality.
-Lastly, the story jumped frantically from subplot to subplot and felt very disconnected.

I had high expectations for this movie because of it's proclaiming to have it's stories so well connected to the parables of Jesus.  I just can not recommend this movie based on my viewing.  If you asked a child they might say different, but all this film has going for it is some slapstick humor, slightly funny looking animated characters, and some well hidden allegories.

1/5 Stars

8318720,4,B001LMUYUW,"I was very excited when I had the opportunity to review this dvd! I could tell by the cover images that it was going to be something my 2 1/2 year old son would enjoy! He's sometimes pretty picky about what he will sit and watch, so it can be hard to keep his attention. The second I turned this dvd on, he was hooked!

I love that I don't have to worry about the message this dvd is sending out to my child. I can clearly see on the back of the dvd what each story will be about and what Bible story it relates to! I love that! I love that my children will learn about the Bible from watching a short dvd! There are 3 episodes included in this dvd, and the entire thing is only 45 minutes long. Definitely a must-see for anyone who has children that enjoy watching a few shows! Our family loves it!",1296432000,,799,3.99375
8318721,2,B001LMUYUW,"Well, first off, my boys (2 and 7) loved the DVD.  The
two main characters, Marty and Gerard, were a huge
hit, and they loved the silly stories.  On the other hand,
I thought the DVD was less than entertaining, and I totally
missed the Bible-based lessons.  The important stuff
was just lost in all that silly!

I was really shocked at how little I enjoyed the movie.
After all, I still laugh at the VeggieTales movies we've
seen a million times.  This series just doesn't even come
close, and I don't see myself buying the next in the series.
