7849512,3,6303536050,"I thought this was a decent movie. Yet, it seems there's an issue I haven't been able to resolve for years. The first time I watched it was back to back with another movie. The first had JMV in a similar situation but was the FIRST time they tried to cross dimensions and even had scenes that I know aren't in the second. Then immediately afterwards I watched this one which picks up with JMV`s character brought in for the second try. However, NOBODY remembersthat first movie and I can't find anything on it anywhere. The original Xtro had nothing to do with this storyline but the movie I watched did. It's been driving me nuts for years.",1519430400,,641,4.440677966101695
7849513,1,6303536050,"I was tricked into watching this movie.  I had not seen the original Xtro.  I was not familiar with the dircector.  I read only the skimpy SCI-FI description of the movie in the yahoo tv online schedule which read, in total: ""The sole survivor of a parallel-world trip joins the woman in charge of another one gone wrong.""  Endquote!  I am a fan of alternate world stories, having had one published.  In view of all of the above, I sat down before my 32"" tv, put the taped movie into the vcr, and prepared to watch a decent action movie -- I thought. I saw Jan-Michael Vincent in a couple of other movies since his character in ""airwolf"" and I think he should have quit after the series ended.  I found myself fast-forwarding much of the movie wanting to get it over with.  I only wanted to see how it came out not what happened to make it come out.  Not recommended for anyone.

7849514,1,6303536050,"XTRO 2: The Second Encounter (Harry Bromley Davenport, 1990)

There are few things on a video box that telegraph ""this is a horrible movie"" better than the combination of a copyright date after 1980 and the name Jan-Michael Vincent. I had hopes for this, being a sequel to one of the eighties' most brilliant and underrated horror films, but I should have known to trust the signs.

Harry Bromley Davenport helmed this sequel to his own XTRO (1984), teaming up once again with scriptwriter Robert Smith, who did such a fantastic job on the original. The similarity between the two films, however, ends there. Three more writers were brought in, two first-timers and a second-timer, and if Smith created a script even a tenth as good as the one for the previous XTRO, it was obliterated in rewrite.

The first part of the tagline says it all: ""Part alien. Part predator."" And rather than the grisly, atmospheric pissed-off-E.T. Of the first film, we get a substandard-action-flick pissed-off Alien. But someone forgot to tell the writers that the alien in Alien was already pissed off, and that Alien was a good horror flick, not a treacly, syrupy sweet family film that begged for an extreme gore treatment.

Do I even need to review the plot, what there is of it? The heads of a secret government project, NEXUS, are Dr. Alex Summerfield (Paul Koslo, whose career bottomed out in Heaven's Gate) and Dr. Julie Casserly (Tara Buckman, one of Cannoball Run's ""Lamborghini Babes""), are trying to create a portal to another dimension. They get three people through, of whom only one returns alive-- a woman. You know what's coming next, though the new film jettisons the infamous birth scene of XTRO and replaces it with an Alien-like chest burster, adding a few other tricks that had no place in the original film. The creature then pursues everyone left in the facility, including Dr. Ron Shepherd (the infamous Mr. Vincent), head of a previous NEXUS installation who'd destroyed the facility rather than let one of these beasts loose upon the world. Trapped with them are The Sidekick and The Army Men, useless two-dimensional shells of characters who exist to die, and The Beautiful Doctor Who's Attracted to a Character, ditto. (Both The Beautiful Doctor etc., played by Rachel Hayward, and one of the Army Men, played by a young Nicholas Lea-- not coincidentally, the only two in the film who have a shred of acting ability-- later turned up in Chris Carter TV series-- Harsh Realm and The X-Files, respectively.) So you have an alien and some human lunch. You know what's going to happen for the rest of the movie.

XTRO 2 is an insult. Why Davenport had anything to do with it is beyond me; both he and Smith should have disowned the film before its release. Horror film fans, especially those who have discovered the brilliance of the original film, should be cautioned to stay far, far away from this dog. (zero)",1104192000,,2918,4.79324055666004
7849515,1,6303536050,"normally id give a film that i enjoyed so much a high star rating, but in this case i must expose it for the crime it is to movie lovers.
firstly, im a b-movie fan and this one rocked my socks off; shoddy acting, pitiful and repetitive sets, embarrasing dialogue and a 'script' to match. i found the movie a pleasant and fun rollercoaster of action- but thats in my opinion, in anyone elses i can imagine the cruel taste of $2 down the drain to be quite bitter.
bottom line, avoid unless you have a thing for terrible (and easily mockable) films. sadly id have to say this is one of my favorites.
if you DO stumble upon this film keep an eye out on the 'jedburg' actor, that guys going places ;)",1077494400,4,695,4.1940298507462686
7849516,1,6303536050,"I've never seen the first X-Tro movie, but I couldn't find any reference to it in this story.  The plot concerns an ultra-secret government project buried under ground.  The project is designed to perfect inter-dimensional teleportation using super-computers and superconductive coils.  First to go through the process is a team of camera-equipped explorers.  When the camera sends back footage across the iso-dimensional divide, we see our intrepid band walking across an otherworldly windswept desert - lifeless....except for a mysterious hemispherical something on the horizon.  Nearing the structure, the group begins to black out, cutting off contact with Earth.  Unwisely, the project remote-recalls one of the team members, but she hasn't come back alone.  Faster than you can say ""and Jonathan Hurt, as 'Kane'"", the unlucky survivor fatally bears an alien that's hideous and otherworldly (but worldly enough to head for the first ventilator shaft it can find).  After bringing in a special-ops team, and Jan Michael Vincent, the project computer seals off the project - trapping our heroes with the beast.  The rest of the movie has our heroes navigating the dark labyrinth of the project's interiors, dodging aliens both insidiously small and hideously huge. ... The flick has some nice touches which hint that somebody imaginative was around (especially the idea that all we ever see of the alien world is through the vid-cam; that was probably so they could do it in miniature rather than having to build a set, but the practicality also highlights what horror movies are about - the picture sent back is impossible to satisfactorily explain, much as true horror must be beyond our powers of understanding).  Nevertheless, the flick never comes close to matching that promise.  ...",1040774400,,1792,5.274647887323944
