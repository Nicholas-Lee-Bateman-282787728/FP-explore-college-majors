We previously order two DVDs from this series and look forward to purchasing more, to build on what the kids have seen (and enjoyed).",1402617600,,254,4.930232558139535

8645188,1,B00IT10OJE,"We are a bit more strict Christian family than most.  We should just do away with any secular Christian movie and we have with most.  Unfortunately, many children's Christian based films include many scenes of foolish before.  These scenes are not the ones that they use to show rebuking, but to make the children laugh.  We are not teaching our children how to do a lot of these worldly thing, such as giving someone a ""wedgy"".  Would you believe that it is in this film?  Theo has some amazing lessons, although we don't care for the animation of some of it.  We pray that someday there will be a children's film company that does not get corrupted by the world or anyone working for the company making the films in any way.  They should all sit down, as Christians, review the film and say...""You know, as Christians, that really has no need to be in the film.""  If it's not in the Bible, don't introduce it.",1486166400,2,911,4.4397590361445785

8645190,5,B00IT10OJE,We love these! Doctrinally sound and entertaining for my 6 -7 year old son.,1470268800,,75,4.428571428571429
8645191,5,B00IT10OJE,"I LOVE these videos! I love that they are biblically sound and not overly goofy like some series that the biblical story. I love the wise, mature, grandfatherly character of Theo. He comes across as such a loving, godly man and is in himself a great role model for children. Every aspect of these videos is creative. The mice Belfry and Luther are darling and every aspect of the video does an excellent job teaching the Bible lesson. I highly recommend these videos - every one of them!",1467763200,,487,4.545454545454546
8645192,5,B00IT10OJE,"I absolutely recommend THEO. My kids and I love it. It is not watered down and the message of the gospel is well presented. There are 5 DVDs total with 3 episodes in each dvd and the ""good news"" is at the end of every dvd. Each episode (what is the church?, road to Romans, the fruit of the spirit, abiding in Christ, adoption, etc) is explained very well and it's so adorable and so well made! I haven't seen many kids Christian cartoons/DVDs that actually teach doctrine but THEO definitely does. Just because kids are young it doesn't mean that they can't understand theology or we shouldn't teach them that because it's deep.  I find it disappointing that most materials for kids are shallow and fluffy these days. My only dissapointment is that I wish there were more THEO DVDs.",1466812800,,783,4.553191489361702
8645193,5,B00IT10OJE,"My kids (2.5, 2.5, 4) love watching Theo.  I appreciate the theological richness of the episodes.  It's screen time I don't have to feel guilty about!  I plan to buy the other DVDs as well.

The only thing I wish were different is that the top menu screen button is Lessons instead of Play All.  I have to scroll down to the bottom to select Play All, which wouldn't even cause a second thought except I like to play these in the van and my manual controls from the driver's seat don't allow that ""scroll-down"" functionality.  So my kids end up watching the first episode over and over again, with my needing to press ""select"" twice every time it ends, instead of a continuous feed of one episode after another.  I know it's a real First World problem, just a suggestion/something to note in case you too were wanting to play these in the car and have those limitations.",1461456000,,870,4.433962264150943
8645194,5,B00IT10OJE,My grandchildren love Theo.  I believe the have them all now. Love Love Theo,1456876800,,76,4.428571428571429
8645195,5,B00IT10OJE,Wonderful DVD. Theology is on point. If you're looking for a great way to share God's truth with your children this is it!,1453161600,,122,4.3478260869565215
