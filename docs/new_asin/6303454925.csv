662182,5,6303454925,"This Lone Ranger movie is action-packed from the beginning until the end, and it's even in color, too! This was the last Lone Ranger movie ever made, and it was the last film in which Clayton Moore was the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels was Tonto. A great finale to their careers! The whole plot centers on five silver medallions cut from the same plaque that, put together, lead to a long-lost city of gold. These medallions belong to Indians, three of whom have been killed by the Hooded Raiders who wish to obtain the riches for themselves. Can the Lone Ranger and Tonto stop the Hooded Raiders from killing the two remaining Indians? Buy the film and find out. Anyone who loves the Lone Ranger will love this movie! A must-have for any Lone Ranger fan!!!",991785600,25,759,4.547445255474453

662376,5,6303454925,"I just spent the afternoon returning to my childhood. First I listened to the Lone Ranger on the radio before I started school. I loved it then. I love it now. My husband and I watched this movie together and reminisced about the 'good old days'. This was just a very good movie. I don't think I had ever seen this one before and I was thrilled with it. The scenery was wonderful. The movie was full of action and lots of wonderful horseback riding. I enjoyed seeing Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger and also when he portrayed the southern gentlemen who pretended to be a bounty hunter. He is a really good actor. Jay Silverheels was great, too. I loved it when his horse Scout kept pulling the covers off of him when they had bedded down for the night. That was really funny. They surely don't make movies anymore like they used to. It is so nice to watch a movie with no ugly words. I didn't mind the fights or the gun fights or the rough and tumble action. That is what you expect in a western. The other actors in this movie were quite good, too. I especially liked the padre and the doctor. If you are a western movie fan or a Lone Ranger fan, this would be a good movie for you. I am so glad that we got to view it today. It brought back a lot of happy memories and times for me. I recommend this movie.",1428796800,3,1309,4.1171875
662377,5,6303454925,"What's not to like about Moore and Silverheels, Silver and Scout in color? The only thing lacking is the straight-up orchestral William Tell Overture a true fan expects to hear at the start and end of any Lone Ranger vehicle. Moore is particularly good (and uncharacteristically unwooden) as the southern gentleman (Lone Ranger in disguise).

When I got the disk, it had no extras and was chopped for the small screen.  This was not the edition that was written about on Amazon reviews.

Since it was so inexpensive, it wasn't worth sending back, so I kept it, but will replace it as soon as a suitable release is made.  I would suggest no one buy this TV edited 'pan and scan' version.  It's worthless as a disk.

With that said, it's a very entertaining movie if you are a Lone Ranger fan.  Nothing wrong with the movie itself.",1362528000,4,657,4.241935483870968

For anyone who grew up watching the TV series this is an excellent addition to your DVD collection.  For those who are new fans of the western genre, you owe it to yourself to see this so you can understand why the Lone Ranger has become such a huge part of American pop culture.

The extras included on the second disc (especially the induction ceremonies of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels into the Cowboy Hall of Fame) are outstanding.  Highly recommended.",1356912000,3,626,4.504424778761062

I teach American Literature and each we year we cover ""Realism and the Frontier"", Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Jack London, etc.  The kids do ok with these tales, but I try to make the end of the unit a little fun for them. I bought this DVD because I knew it was a good clean family movie, and it would give them some of the same type story from the unit.

They all think I am nuts, standing in the back of the room, singing every word to the theme song.  But once the film gets going, they love it.",1355443200,4,751,3.947019867549669

It did give some history at the begining and the color version was very vivid. As usuall the Ranger and Tonto's part was played very well. I would recomend this to anyone who is a fan also.

662685,5,6303454925,"Reviewers in film guides often regard this as a lesser film than the first theatrical film of The Lone Ranger, but I'm glad to see most fans know better.  True, Clayton Moore is showing his years by now, and the scenic desert shots are more dramatic in the first film, but this one is every bit as good.  Lots of action, a nice mix of earnestness and campiness, and some good reminders about racial tolerance.  Moore's extended scenes without a mask, disguised only with a blond wig and Southern gentleman's goatee, are especially amusing.  He is scamming the film's villainness, pretending to be a bounty hunter, while flirting outrageously with her, and it's a hoot.  We never see the LR as a suave devil, and this part can't help but remind us that Moore was linked romantically with the tragic sex bombshell Lupe Velez in his younger days.  The final shootout, in a deserted Indian village, is quite stark and imaginative.  Jay Silverheels also gets a chance to do some acting.  All-in-all, great fun.",1244851200,5,1005,4.735632183908046

I am glad I was able to get this film because Copies are fast disappearing and the manufacturer has discontinued it. What a travesty. The Lone Ranger with Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels is classic movie fare and should be available forever. The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold is a real treat and a pleasant follow-up to the first theatrical Lone Ranger feature release.

The larger theme here is, of course, the struggle between good and evil (good wins) and the actual story sort of focuses on the bad treatment of Indians by rotten local whites, especially by the evil local sheriff. The Indians are in a poverty plight and, if The Lost City of Gold could be located by the tribe, their situation would be alleviated.
There's plenty of action and the locations are just tops. If you're at all into the western film genre, you'll love this one.",1189555200,7,673,4.524590163934426

THE LONE RANGER CREED (Disc Two)

Written by Fran Striker.

Clayton Moore was a circus acrobat at the age of eight and grew up in the Midwest (Illinois)...worked in the circus and traveled to New York and then Hollywood where he became a stuntman and bit player...inducted into the ""Stuntman's Hall of Fame"" in 1982...also received the ""Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame'"" also the ""Hall of Great Western Performers of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum"" both in 1990...Clayton was once quoted ""Playing him [the Lone Ranger] made me a better person."", ""Once I got the Lone Ranger role, I didn't want any other. I was playing the good guy.""...""I will continue wearing the white hat and black mask until I ride up into the big ranch in the sky."" (On his costume as the Lone Ranger, February 4, 1985)...Clayton very much enjoyed quoting and lived by ""A Ranger's Creed"" which included this moral lesson ""That God put the firewood there, but every man must gather and light it himself.""

Great job by VCI Entertainment for releasing the digital transfere with a clean, clear and crisp print...looking forward to more of the same from The Lone Ranger vintage era...order your copy now from Amazon or VCI Entertainment, stay tuned once again with a top notch B-Western from VCI...just the way we like 'em!

What a different country this would be if kids still tried to emulate the silver screen cowboys of yesteryear.  As for the movie, it has everything.  Rich color, beautiful scenery, some of the best fight scenes ever put on film, and a subtext about the evils of racism.

662692,4,6303454925,"Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels established the definitive Lone Ranger and Tonto characterization for all ages. They started in 1949 and had a successful TV series running for many years ending sometime after the mid 1950's. John Hart's Lone Ranger was a filler when Clayton went into a hiatus from the series. The TV series was capped by the ""Lone Ranger"" movie in 1957, which epitomized what a Lone Ranger cinematic presentation should be, unequalled in production design and grandiose in  presentation. However, ""The Lone Ranger and the City of Gold"" is a lesson  on how not to follow-up a successful movie with a sequel, as this pales in comparison. This is like a TV movie transposed to the big scren. But this film is significant for it signalled the end of the Moore-Silverheels film rendition of these western heroes. And about time too. This movie shows both actors getting old as the wrinkles of age are markedly obvious in this excellent VCI refurbishing of the film. The colors and sharpness are outstanding. That is the main reason why this must be part of one's DVD collection. This is labelled as a Region 1 DVD but appears to be a Region 0 disc as I was able to open it up in my Region 3 player. Thank heavens for that. Now all other Lone Rangers fans anywhere in the world can truly enjoy this one. This is why I rate it 4 stars.",1068336000,25,1348,4.54320987654321

Amidst a plethora of cereal commercials, The Lone Ranger and Tonto chased the bad guys right off our B&W TV screens back in the baby-boomer '50s.  This is the second of two feature length films produced after the TV series ended first-run episodes in 1956.  The color photography enhances the excitement of larger-than-life heroes.  The script and other production values are Grade B, at best, but, who cares?  When The Lone Ranger, on his fiery horse, Silver, rides over the horizon outlaws are out of luck.  The Lone Ranger's distinctive manner of dress (red neckerchief, white hat, and blue jump suit) identifies him as a real American hero.  The trademark black mask, silver bullets, and gleaming six-guns effectively round out the mysterious and heroic image.  As an interesting aside, the movie makes some thoughtful observations of the racial injustice suffered by Native Americans.  As usual, good triumphs over evil, and traditional values are preserved.  This is a great way to introduce today's high tech kids to the legned of The Lone Ranger.  Simple pleasures are the best.  Enjoy the ride, right down to the final ""Heigh-Yo, Silver, away!""  ;-)",1006300800,41,1607,5.099616858237548
