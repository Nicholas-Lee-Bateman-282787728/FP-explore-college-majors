5020056,5,B006UKX5QK,I missed it,1404950400,,11,3.0
5020057,5,B006UKX5QK,"I liked this series when it aired, now that I have ordered the dvds, when will the rest of it be released? Its been nearly two years since the the first half of season 2 came out. Ridiculous to release only half a series. There are 65 episodes total, not 39, and unlike other animation series of the day, this one has a conclusion.",1393977600,14,331,4.1875
5020058,5,B006UKX5QK,IM SURPRISED HOW GOOD CARTOONS WERE BACK IN THE DAYS MOST GOOD CARTOONS WERE FROM THE 80S HOWEVER THIS CONAN CARTOON 90S IS VERY GOOD THE SONG IS CATCHY THE PLOT AND CHARACTERS ARE AWESOME,1393113600,4,188,4.4
5020059,5,B006UKX5QK,"The plots and animation are great for a Saturday morning cartoon. I didn't remember seeing this when it originally aired, but being a Conan fan I decided to give it a try. I highly recommend it.",1391990400,5,194,4.416666666666667
5020060,5,B006UKX5QK,Bought this for my son. My son says if arrived in excellent condition and he's really quite happy with it.,1377388800,5,106,4.35
5020061,5,B006UKX5QK,A good continuation of the animated series.  A good fantasy escape for the series started by Howard in his books.,1354665600,4,113,4.65
5020062,5,B006UKX5QK,"He loves this series for some reason, he's an 80's child so he grew up with this and loves watching this.",1354060800,4,105,4.0476190476190474
5020063,4,B006UKX5QK,I wish you could have put everyone of the episodes on the disk from start to finish for season two just as they showed last year. THE  product is just pretty good for half of the episodes. I got to see it clearly without digital problems. I always enjoyed watching the movie and animated series. THE show is  one I like but will do my research on it before next purchase.,1344729600,4,371,4.211267605633803
5020064,5,B006UKX5QK,"I have enjoyed this series in the past, but missed out on seeing this part of Season 2. This DVD set had some great episodes that I know that you will love! The cartoons will bring you back to some of the circa 1980's cartoons, and you will love seeing the artwork and be transported to the world of Conan! The series is full of great adventure and suspense, and if you have never seen this series before, you can easily pick this up without feeling lost. I highly recommend this or any of the other seasons in the Conan the Adventurer Series...it is a great series for all!",1333238400,13,574,4.275229357798165
5020065,5,B006UKX5QK,Great quality.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Brings back so many fond memories.  I always loved the animated series.,1476748800,2,111,5.411764705882353
5020066,4,B006UKX5QK,"For a Conan cartoon aimed at children, its not bad. I would have liked to see a more Howard type adult version, something like ""Fire and Ice"" with Frazetta. But hay, I cant complain overall - if you grew up with Transformers or G.I. Joe - its similar animation",1465862400,3,260,4.326530612244898
5020067,5,B006UKX5QK,One of the better animated series.  Way ahead of it's time.,1463961600,2,59,4.363636363636363

5020069,5,B006UKX5QK,"Prompt delivery of a clean, quality product. Great example of ""80's cartoons"" that have something lacking in more recent cartoons. Wish there was a way to get the final season! :)",1442361600,5,179,4.806451612903226

8504595,5,B006UKX5QK,it's a great series even though Amazon doesn't have the whole series they have at least three of the series but they don't have all of it it's good show hopefully they get the rest,1509580800,,180,4.171428571428572
8504596,1,B006UKX5QK,"Wow.  Not just a bad transfer, but a horrible transfer.  There is a red tinge to the picture that's so bad, you really can't make anything out.
Also, it seems like there is a slightly ""sped up"" transfer or something because things are slightly ""sped up"" during playback.",1499299200,,270,4.604166666666667
8504597,5,B006UKX5QK,Enjoyed rewatching the cartoon,1490313600,,30,6.75
8504598,3,B006UKX5QK,"Really ugly transfer to DVD.  I don't know what everyone else who says differently is seeing, but this DVD was done the lazy-man's way.  This DVD set is created from a sped-up 25 frame per second PAL master dumped directly to a 30 frame (60 field) per second NTSC DVD with zero thought of converting it properly.  As a result, there's nasty temporal field blending resulting in ghost trails in almost all action and panning sequences.  Not to mention that everything is sped up 4% due to the use of PAL.  Sad.  Given Shout Factory's past track record of doing stellar animated DVD releases I can only hope this was the best quality master they could get their hands on.

The actual show, though, is great.  I'm a fan of Conan and I didn't know there was an animated show until recently.  It's toned down Conan for younger audiences, but you can definitely tell that the show runners knew the backstory and used what they could.",1487116800,2,927,4.536144578313253
8504599,5,B006UKX5QK,Love it!,1478822400,,8,3.5
8504600,5,B006UKX5QK,"Who doesn't love watching childhood favorites.  Its cheesy as heck but who cares,  you would only be getting this for the same reason.  Nostalgia.",1478822400,,146,5.0
