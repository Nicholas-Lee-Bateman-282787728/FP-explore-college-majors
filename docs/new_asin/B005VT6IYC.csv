4897491,5,B005VT6IYC,"Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams is excellent!  I am a yoga instructor as well as an occupational therapist and I have been looking for a good gentle yoga DVD to recommend to my students for their home program.  This one fits the bill in spades!  Jane emphasizes safety, good alignment and listening to one's body throughout this DVD.  Jane's apparent love of yoga and her joy in teaching yoga comes through in all aspects. She teaches the yoga exactly as one would expect in a live yoga class, with plenty of time to follow her clear, step by step instructions, giving her students some time to actually experience the pose.  There is no sense of rushing through any of the sequences, and one can actually do the yoga poses with her without having to pause the DVD to ""catch up""!  Jane divides her DVD into 5 crucial segments: - 1) a warmup section which is critical for preventing injuries and maximizing enjoyment; 2) a standing & balance section (so important for all of us!) with great use of props to allow all persons regardless of experience or flexibility/strength to participate; 3) leg and trunk section for core strength which can be done on the floor or modified for a seated chair position; 4) upper body/arms segment done seated on a chair to facilitate safe focus on the upper body; and 5) seven minute relaxation during which the student can integrate the ""fruits of their labor"" while gently releasing any remaining stress or muscle tension.

I personally tried all the segments myself and found the sequencing to be very calming, as well as challenging. Jane teaches the basics of yoga breathing in the first warmup section and continues with cues to use the breath throughout the following sequences. The yoga (diaphragmatic) breaths help increase lung capacity as well prevent injuries. Each of the 5 segments are a yoga workout all unto themselves although I would recommend doing the warmup section before doing any of the other segments, for maximum benefit.  I would also recommend doing the relaxation segment each time one uses the DVD. The student can make the yoga poses as challenging as one wants at the time.  Done consistently, the yoga presented in this DVD would help facilitate better postural/spinal alignment, increased core strength and improved balance.  The strengthening poses are done after instruction for good alignment, which increases both their safety and effectiveness.

I also really enjoyed the peaceful background music used in this DVD - it began to feel a bit like a moving meditation as I followed the yoga instructions. Having an actual student doing the warmups (segment 1) and relaxation (segment 5) was great too!  I felt somewhat energized but relaxed after I completed all the segments.  Thank you to Jane and your student! I have already started recommending it to my students!",1321747200,313,2834,4.903765690376569
4897492,5,B005VT6IYC,"I have been waiting over a year for Jane's new new yoga workout and it is just as wonderful as her first one and even more so.  There are 5 different segments that allow you to choose some or all of them for your workout.  They are a warmup, balance, upper body, torso and leg, and finally a relaxation.  Jane has added gentle, relaxing music to the workout that doesn't interfere but enhances the practice.  With over 90 minutes of yoga instruction, this is one of the best bargains you will find.  I am able to easily do all of the poses and I am 67. I am so thrilled with this workout!  I know continued use of this will keep me going strong to hopefully 90 or 100.",1320710400,7,668,4.1395348837209305

4897520,4,B005VT6IYC,"I really enjoy using Jane Adams' DVDs.  This is the first Yoga dvd since a back injury resulting in bulging discs that I've been able to use.  It's pretty much my go-to when everything starts to hurt. It is slow but it's very much a beginners/very gentle routine.  Jane explains things very thoroughly in my opinion and yes, it can get old because it's very slow, careful, and controlled movements.  Therefore, if you feel you've graduated from this one, you may want to try her Gentle Yoga: 7 Beginning Yoga Practices.  It has similar moves but they are expanded upon and lots more additional movements.  I really feel my hip flexors in that one and can feel where it will definitely help my bursitis.  But I really don't think I would have been able to do that dvd if I hadn't started with this one.",1471910400,3,801,4.482758620689655

I am returning to yoga gradually, and I do not practice with the whole video at one time. Even if I only do the lying warm-up, I feel my body is getting a good stretch, and a balanced workout. The other modules are also gentle and effective. I can progress at my own pace. This is a nice practice for seniors or anyone else who requires extra care.",1470009600,6,464,4.1098901098901095
4897523,5,B005VT6IYC,"I love the Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams tape which truly focuses on strength, balance and flexibility. I have an office job where I find myself sitting before my computer for long periods of time. By the end of the day my brain is foggy and my body feels stiff from not moving. When I use this tape and focus first on the upper body and then one of the other practices I completely unwind, relax and stretch all my muscles. My head clears and I feel very energized by the end of the practice. Sometimes I will use the Lying Warm up to stretch out first thing in the morning before my day begins as well. My flexibility has dramatically increased since my husband and I have discovered the Jane Adams tape series. I used to have chronic back stiffness but now thanks to Jane's clear direction and wonderful teaching I remember her guidance for various poses which allows me to stretch my back muscles out whenever I need to do so. Thank you Jane for bringing the best of yoga to life for all of us.",1467244800,2,996,4.303191489361702
4897524,1,B005VT6IYC,"My first quibble is with the use of the word yoga. Streches or exercises would be more accurate. It seems like 80% of the ""yoga"" is the use of the mat and the music. The second quibble is major for me. I can only hear 5-10% of what she says. the background interference is usually louder than her voice. My third quibble is that although the cover shows the senior standing, many of the exercises are expected to be done on the floor. I don't know many seniors that want ""gentle"" exercise who are have the balance to get up and down from the floor, have the flexibility to get up from the floor or the strength to actually do it. I have had this for a while and keep pulling it out thinking it will get better. Instead, I find myself disliking it more and more.

It may be great for active seniors that just want a ""stretch"" day that have excellent hearing.",1464307200,6,857,4.225609756097561
4897525,5,B005VT6IYC,"Thank you Jane Adams, you have given me my life back. Prior to purchasing this DVD I had never done Yoga, gentle or otherwise. For the last 10 years I have struggled with Osteoarthritis, and more recently osteoporosis. And, most recently breast cancer. The chemo, radiation, and post hormonal treatments I received left me with these conditions being further exacerbated, and my entire muscular skeleton system very weakened. I had heard Yoga was recommended as a post cancer treatment but I had resisted because I was already devoting a lot of time to physical therapy exercises (some of which incorporated some yoga stretching and strengthening), but not to the extent a full program like this. Also, I don't really like group exercising or having to go to classes away from home. But being frustrated I chose this program after reading other excellent reviews, because it gave me control of where and when.  I have now been at it a full three months and the results have been wonderful. It was difficult at first, but I didn't give up if I lost balance or couldn't complete a move. In the beginning I did it every day, but only the Lying Warm-ups and then Balance and Standing Poses. After a few weeks of getting the hang of it, I changed to 5 days a week and added the Upper Body and Torso and Leg Strength Flexibility, alternating different days and taking weekends off. Now I'm on a routine of every other day regardless, and going through all four routines. It takes just under 2 hours with very brief breaks between routines and it seems to be just the right amount. Anyone, anyone! who has early stage arthritis, moderate, or even advanced arthritis should be doing gentle yoga and I only wish I had started doing it 10 years ago.",1464220800,7,1739,4.664495114006515
4897526,4,B005VT6IYC,"So easy to follow. I can choose the lesson I want to do in the order I want. The exercises are not difficult but yet very effective. My husband, who has Parkinson's, loves the stretching he gets and needs and can follow at his own pace.

I am in midlife and have some injuries so going to a typical yoga class in the studio is frustrating because certain poses will aggravate them; yet I so need the movement and stretching and strength and flexibility.  Having a home video is perfect.  I can stop and start it as I want to.  Being at home I can use a chair as a prop when appropriate.  Jane Adams has a lovely voice and gives just the right amount of instruction for me to follow the exercise in correct form and still maintain a relaxing atmosphere.  At age 55 I do not find the video too ""easy"" as I have some ""senior"" videos in the past.  She describes several options on certain poses according to the viewers ability.

Most yoga instructors (especially if they are young or male) don't consider the lower back and the strain some of the yoga positions can do to it.  Jane is a careful teacher, always directing you to pull your tailbone down and use your abs to support you.  I get tired of younger instructors because they do everything fast and you have to watch them in their perfect youthful bodies wrapped in very fashionable exercise outfits. Makes me wanna scream !

Her 'upper body' and 'relief from computer work' practices are particularly wonderful after work, and the 'lying warm up' is a great whole body practice. I love that she includes movements for stiff ankles and hands! She is easy to follow and offers modified moves for less flexible bodies. My range of motion, balance, muscle tone and strength are increasing despite discontinuing my P.T. exercises, and I feel great! I alternate between Jane Adams and Rodney Yee practices for beginners. I paid full price for my first Jane Adams video, and was lucky to receive this one as a gift. The worst thing I can say about it is the set is simple (her other video is set in gorgeous Glacier National Park, this one is in a simple studio. No biggie). I am going to purchase her balance video next, and expect that one to be equally good. Very highly recommended for beginners and anyone looking to restore mobility!",1437177600,3,1083,4.616580310880829

4897557,5,B005VT6IYC,"I am a klutz; always have been.  I hate exercise of any kind;  always have.  But I've forced myself to do it.  And I prefer shorter Amazon reviews.  But here's a long one - with apologies to you, dear reader.

I cannot say enough good things about this DVD.  I wish I could give it 10 stars.  Originally, I took a yoga class 2x a week to help lower blood pressure.  (Already did treadmill at home 3x/wk.)  Classes were ok but I got far more out of this DVD than I did the classes.

Ms.  Adams instruction is clear and patient, allowing you to work up to achieving the proper form easily.  The DVD is organized into different sections so you can do much or as little as you choose, and, in the privacy of your own home at the time of your own choosing.  After using ""Gentle Yoga""  for a couple of months - 2x/wk - I actually needed to move onto a more challenging DVD (selected ""Gentle Yoga: 7 Practices..."").  Currently, I combine different sections of each DVD.  Doing an entire routine takes 96 minutes which, for someone who hates exercising as much as do I, would seem torturous; but, truly, the time seems to pass very quickly.  Most importantly, while improvements in flexibility and agility have certainly occurred, they're minor compared to the dramatic improvements in balance.  Oh. and one more thing - a couple of minor aches and pains have vanished.

Finally, contrary to some of the less favorable reviews, I found Ms. Adam's voice to be very soothing and pleasant.  Perhaps the type of DVD player and/or TV used affects the sound quality.

4897563,5,B005VT6IYC,"I particularly recommend gentle yoga for people who are stiff and out of shape, because its a slower practice that focuses on making it easier to get into postures. It could also be helpful for people recovering from injuries or surgery, or who have joint replacements and need to explore postures slowly and carefully.  This DVD is a slow-paced yoga practice that engages the mind and there is continual encouragement to pay attention to the sensations of moving and breathing. Gentle yoga might not be as physically demanding, but it offers all the transformative benefits that people look to yoga for.  In this DVD, the movement is slow, each movement is linked with breath, and you enter into the postures graduallymoving in and out of each pose first, and then finding a holding position. It provided me with all the benefits of a yoga experience at a slower, easier pace. By focusing on alignment principles, breathing techniques and modifications of basic poses, this yoga can be accessible to everyone, regardless of age, fitness level or physical challenges.  I liked how the DVD was broken into different segments and you could decide which one you wanted to do for the day.  All the segments are short enough that you should be able to fit some time in for yoga each day.  I highly recommend this DVD to beginners or anyone looking for something that is not too strenuous and wants to do some type of stretching and positive movement each day.",1428624000,6,1454,4.8

Then I heard about Jane Adams and a senior DVD so I came to Amazon and started researching yoga DVD's for older adults and read some of the reviews on several of Jane Adams DVD's and decided on this one so I bought it.  I am SO GLAD I DID!  I love this DVD!  I am 53, have had cancer and am not very active and this is perfect for me!  My Dr. recommended yoga and I am loving this DVD as I can finally do it successfully.  I like the way the DVD is made so that I can combine sessions or just do one or two.  I like the warm-ups first thing in the morning (not too long - 20 minutes) and it helps with  morning stiffness.  Then later in the day I can repeat the warm ups before doing balancing and standing poses (33 min) or upper body (13 min.) and/or torso and leg strength and flexibilty (20 min).  I can end with relaxation (7 min) so I can mix and match as time suits. I also like to do the stretches in the evening followed by the relaxation to put me in the mood for bed.  Ms. Adams has a nice soothing voice and the DVD is well made with easily demonstrated poses and is easy to follow. THANK YOU JANE ADAMS!",1424649600,5,1270,3.883720930232558

4897594,2,B005VT6IYC,"I bought this in July of 2014. It has a copyright of 2011. I also find the quality of the audio to be painful to listen to. A big part of the problem is Jane's voice. The pitch of her voice jumps around in a range from high and squeaky to a typical mid-range female voice. When she goes high and squeaky, the mic seems to amplify her voice, adding to the grates-on-your-nerves effect. It is anything but relaxing.

Her instruction is very good, so it is very disappointing that I cannot tolerate the audio. I am trying to learn some of the poses so I can incorporate them into my routine, but I will never be able to use this as a follow-along routine with her. The audio is too jarring.

For the instruction, I would rate this 5 stars. For the audio quality 1 star. Overall I give it 2 stars because I think that audio quality is a very important part of yoga instruction. What a shame that no one involved in this production did anything to correct the audio/voice issues before they started selling this. Surely someone realized that the audio was a serious issue and yet they released it anyway. Very disappointed.",1406332800,15,1118,4.396135265700483

I like that there are several routines so I can mix and match each day according to what I feel needs to be worked on. I would highly recommend this DVD to any beginner or anyone who wants a more gentle workout.

**UPDATE*  After several weeks of using this DVD daily, I can only recommend it even more highly!  I had hoped to improve flexibility, lessen stress, and have more energy - and it's done all that.  BUT, the real benefits are the ""hidden treasures"".  I've always been a mouth breather, and would walk a mile daily huffing and puffing and breathing through my mouth.  One day I realized I was breathing close-mouthed - ""slow, full breaths"" as Jane says - as I was taking my brisk morning walk.  So much more beneficial, and this took me completely by surprise.  Better breathing was not one of the benefits I had been expecting!

Secondly, I've been sway backed for as long as I can remember.  But little by little my posture has improved.  I'm proud to say I'm no longer sway-backed, and as my back has been strengthened and pulled into alignment, no more lower back aches!  Another ""hidden treasure""!

Anyone who wants to give yoga a try would be well-advised to start with this dvd.  Just do what you can (I was the shakiest of beginners, believe me!)  But as you practice, you will see such improvement - and maybe find some hidden treasures of your own!",1374192000,25,1532,4.4765342960288805
4897632,4,B005VT6IYC,"was a little skeptical about trying yoga....had gone to class with daughter and found it a little daunting.

I have not been active in recent years but did jog for 14 plus years; now past medicare age and finding that I am not able to balance as I used to...

I have heard both good and not so good comments but I have only good things to say about Jane and this DVD.

First of all she makes it so clear, relaxing and easy to understand....there is no rush to get into poses.

Secondly I bought this DVD in January and have been using it 2 times a week since then so over 6 months...I can begin to see that my balance has been improving quite a bit; I feel good when I finish the hour and a half.....I do it just 2 times a week as it is quite long, but I don't want to miss any of the routines.

I recently went to one of my daughter's yoga classes while visiting her and came away not as satisfied as when I do Yoga with Jane......and no, my daughter's class wasn't that difficult but I just feel that Jane's Yoga is so complete, touching on all aspects, i.e. balance, inner core, upper body strength, flexibility and the floor exercises......by the way, I used to absolutely hate getting down on the floor to exercise and now that is my favorite part.  (except for the wonderful 7 minute relaxation)

The gym I belong to offered only a complete class with upside-down positions etc. My friend Millie (retired)said I should find a class that offered ""Gentle Yoga"". Unfortunately the times were weekday mornings. Now that I found out the type of yoga to look for, I searched the internet and found Jane Adam's DVD. This DVD has the perfect combination of stretches and relaxation ""poses"". I bought a comfy 2"" thick mat and played it and felt great. No perfect bodies to demoralize me, no tiny space to fit myself & mat into and convenient for whenever I have 20+ minutes to stretch and relax.

Her exercises are perfect for me.  Her knowledge and love of yoga really comes through in the video.  Her voice is calm and relaxing and the programs are just the right length -- not too short, not too long.

4897644,5,B005VT6IYC,"I needed to work on my flexibility , besides getting older I have had some huge lifestyle changes and am not getting enough physical exercise, with a 10 pound weight limit and degenerated discs in my lower back and chronic sciatica I needed to chose something to gain back flexibility without adding to the damage. So I did quit a bit of looking before I chose this DVD. I figured I would not be able to even do all the warm up exercises, and some of them were tough for me. Being geared to older people great care is taken to encourage you to not push to the pain point, listen to your body and honor it if it says nope can't do this or modify any exercise you need.  Also great emphasis put on no stress and keeping your muscles and joints relaxed.  I was able to do more than I expected and when I was done , (and for me this was the real kicker) my lower back which is in constant pain felt so much better.  I am taking it slow, decided to do the warm ups only and walk 15 minutes a day to start and then go from there. There are 4 sessions on the Dvd 1. Warm ups about 20 minutes, these are all done laying down. 2. Yoga stretches all  for the upper body and all done sitting down I think this one runs around 30 minutes 3. Stretches for the lower body - all done standing. And 4th a cool down period of stretching.  There are enough different moves that if some are not doable for you and you have to leave a couple out of your routine, the others will still be enough to help build flexibility, balance and increase strength.  I feel like I can easily give this 5 stars because I have a damaged body and it is responding positively to these exercises and not causing more damage  that is what I was looking for, something that would alleviate pain and hopefully add strength to what can be salvaged on this old body and strengthen muscles around the muscles that need help and thus hopefully prevent additional or new damage.  Getting old stinks , but this Dvd is doing what I had hoped.",1364688000,39,1994,4.174479166666667

The yoga sessions, that I do most, are the 20 minute lying warmups, the upper body 13 minute, and the Torso and leg strength and flexibility, 20 minutes.  I tried the balancing and standing poses for 33 minutes, a few times, but it was a little bit to much for me, at the time, and I have been working out for many years.  I want to try it again, when I feel, that, I have the strength for it.  I usually do a walk aerobic, exercise, first, then I do the yoga, when I have the time.  I like Jane Adams, she doesn't talk too much, during the workout, but she explains very well, how to do a move, and she is not too slow.  I like that, because I am very busy, but I just can not let a day go by, without doing, some kind of workout.",1362441600,5,774,3.80625

4897650,4,B005VT6IYC,"I bought this DVD because it was reviewed as being a reasonable yoga routine, and that turned out to be true.  Some of the other yoga DVDs I've bought to supplement my weekly class have been too difficult for someone who started yoga in her late 50s (despite being active my whole life).  Yoga requires a surprising amount of strength and is not for sissies!  Those who have practiced it for a long time sometimes forget that.  However, there were some comments about the voice of the instructor being grating - and it is - especially at the start of the routine.  It's very high-pitched and her phrasing is odd; but you get used to it and she also goes into a more natural mode later in the routine.  I would hope that Ms. Adams puts out another DVD but gets some coaching on how to speak before she does that.",1361577600,8,811,4.337748344370861

The reason I gave it 4 stars is the quality of the video is home-movieish.  At one point on the warm up you can even hear a plane or truck go by and the voice quality is echoey.

4897663,1,B005VT6IYC,"I should've known I should turn it off once the audio came on. I found the Instructor's voice to be the opposite of soothing or relaxing it affected me like nails on a chalkboard.

I had been attending a Gentle Yoga class 2 times a week and was looking for something to augment that at end of week so I didn't always feel quite so tight in Monday's class after no gentle yoga since Wednesday. So I popped this DVD in one Sunday and that was the end of my Gentle Yoga career, for now.

I did 2 of the sections. I was missing my Real World Instrutors' voice and style. I'm used to doing each pose for longer and more repetitions. But I didn't feel I was over doing anything. Looking back I think it was the lateral leg raises with the chair that got me.

Next day until today, over 4 weeks later, I'm still having pain in my right hamstring. Who knew it took so long for a hamstring injury to heal?! Still popping the Tylenol and Aleve and applying the Bengay. Still using a heating pad on particularly sore days. Still have to be careful of sitting too long or how I sit. BUT at least now I can feel injury starting to improve. I only have to stand a minute or two and let the hamstring 'regroup' after sitting or riding in a car.

SO NOPE wouldn't recommend this video or Instructor. I'm hopefull that by the time the next 10 week real world season rolls around I'll actually be able to reenroll and attend again. Thankfully I was at week 8 of my real world class so only missed 2 of 10 weeks I'd paid for.

Even though the DVD is listed for people 10 years younger, she might do fewer repetitions of some of the moves but is able to do most of this DVD after gaining the strength from the first DVD and she really feels great about being able to do something to keep herself healthy.  She LOVES both DVDs and is getting me to try this one now, too.  She says she has tangible improvements in her strength and balance and she has not felt this way with the other tapes I have gotten for her, many of which she was concerned would be more harmful to her condition than helpful.

The separate chapters for different areas of the body are perfect and I can focus on one area or several during my at home practice.  Osteoporosis, poor balance and depression have led me to practice yoga .  Love yoga and love Jane Adams!  Only one small criticism...Jane's voice is soft and high and it's difficult to understand all her words.  Perhaps the sound/tone should have been adjusted when the DVD was made.
UPDATE 4/13:  have tried a couple of other DVDs for Yoga and always find this Jane Adams one most helpful and while a little slow in parts, it is a good workout .",1339545600,7,933,4.612121212121212

Gentle Yoga is one of those essential items.  I love this gentle, intelligent, and oh so soothing yoga dvd by Jane so much, I want to share it.  After a stressful day at work, I come home to this oasis of serenity and feel so much better -- mentally and physically. In just a short time, my posture has improved and so has my flexibility. For a couch-potato to enjoy a 90 minute exercise dvd is an amazing thing! Jane provides excellent instruction and cuing (you don't even need to look at the screen) and always gives you enough time to come out of a pose before starting another. Gentle Yoga is divided into 20-minute-or-so exercise segments: warm-up, balance, upper body, torso and leg, and a wonderful 7-minute relaxation. So even when I can't do the entire dvd, I can fit in a segment or 2. I've tried yoga on and off over the decades and never liked it until I tried this one.  I see family members losing balance, flexibility and posture with age and I am determined not to go the same way.  With this Gentle Yoga dvd, I think I have a good chance!

Still I exercise at least 1 1/2 hours a day.  I needed a yoga workout that didn't expect my body to react like it was 20, yet I wanted something that was challenging and would give my body a workout.  I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and decided that I would give this one a chance.  I am so glad I did.  The DVD is divided into several segments so that you can choose which ones you do in a day.  The segment on balance is excellent.(33 min)  It not only challenges your balance abilities (I still hold onto a chair in some parts), but it is also a strengthening section for your muscles.

This DVD introduces Yoga to those of us who are middle aged or beyond and want to regain some of the flexibility and balance that we had when we were younger.  The approach is indeed gentle.  The poses are thoroughly described with easy to understand instructions.  There are often variations given on a pose for different levels of flexibility or strength.  Many of the exercises are done with a chair for support, if needed.  I especially love the downward facing puppy for those of us who aren't likely to achieve downward facing dog!!! One section is done completely seated.
The DVD is divided into several sections so you can do as much or as little as you feel up to or concentrate on a specific goal.

The pace is perfect and the moves were exactly as described.....gentle and doable.  We did not have to pretzel and there was no stress or strain.  I called my sister right away to tell her about this DVD.  It is soothing, easy to navigate through, and the demonstrations are very easy to do and follow.  With other dvd's, I always felt like I had to hurry up, like I was straining to put my body through the moves and ultimately it was a stressful experience instead of relaxing.

On the CD she shows three different appoaches for each move, which makes it possible for all levels to feel comfortable. Jane loves what she does and she has been the one who told me I can do this and has given me the desire to forever continue yoga. Thank you Jane!!!",1327363200,,809,4.328947368421052
4897680,5,B005VT6IYC,"This is a GREAT DVD.  I'm in my late 50s and my husband is 70.  We do this DVD together and wish we had started years ago.  It is easy to follow and we can see the difference in our flexibility, strength and balance.  A bonus is that I see an improvement in my posture.  If you are looking for a yoga DVD that you will enjoy and one where you will notice an improvement in your body and state of mind, this is it.",1327276800,4,413,3.8117647058823527
4897681,5,B005VT6IYC,"This is a wonderful DVD for those of us who are trying to become more flexible and strong or to maintain flexibility.
I have used another of Jane's DVD's ""Yoga for Seniors""  for the past two years with my 94 year old mother.
That is also a very good DVD for those who need to do Yoga in a chair or standing.  I appreciate this current
DVD because it is a bit more strenuous but at the same time is gentle enough for most people.
The fact that it is divided into sections allows one to do just one section and feel a sense of completion
or to do the entire DVD for a more thorough workout. Jane's gentle encouraging, spirit comes through in helping all of us to experience more overall well-being.",1326758400,2,696,4.225563909774436
4897682,4,B005VT6IYC,"As soon as I started using Gentle Yoga, I became more mindful of my alignment, which improved certain poses, and noted I was gaining flexibility. As an aging boomer, the Balance segment is the most challenging...although I'm already seeing progress (always being mindful NOT to hold my breath and to relax into the poses!)...and the Standing segment will help with leg strength and stability. I deal with neck and low back issues so I know to make any necessary modifications to avoid stressing vulnerable areas.

Although very new to this Gentle Yoga practice, my body has already come to appreciate how it helps start my day. A couple days ago I made the 'mistake' of not doing it and could feel the difference. The more I use it, the more I appreciate how this practice benefits me, making me feel more limber, lighter.

Jane's pacing never has me feeling rushed or out of sync with what's being instructed. I really like how she's helped me redirect my internal focus...something I'm lax at in my own, more intense practice....and her cuing means not having to crane my neck to see the TV.

Unlike yoga DVDs which feature the instructor in an expansive set or some stunning outdoor locale, this is a very simple production. Just Jane in a small studio accompanied by soft music (although she has a student demonstrate the Warm Up and Relaxation segments).

I do wish the music would continue behind the menu screen so that once the Relaxation segment ends I could remain in Shavasana longer. At some point, I'd also like to see Jane do a gentle Vinyasa flow DVD.",1326585600,66,1566,4.704379562043796
4897683,1,B005VT6IYC,"I got the DVD today and popped it into my computer; this is where hours of trouble began. The disk wouldn't load & I couldn't get it to eject.  My husband had to take the computer into the iMAC store to get the disk out; they said it stuck because it is an unknown format.  Okay, then I tried it in the other played attached to the t.v. & the picture was  very grainy. I have top of the line equipment and have never had this problem with any other DVD.",1325894400,9,453,3.956043956043956
4897684,5,B005VT6IYC,"This is a great video.  I am 71 and find it a bit taxing, but will stick with it.  It is very rewarding to get through the routines.",1325635200,,132,3.6785714285714284
4897685,5,B005VT6IYC,"Whether you're looking for an introduction to yoga as a novice or you're seeking additional work for your existing practice; Jane's gentle instruction, combined with her calming and easy to understand voice, will gracefully lead you into the best range of motion you could hope to achieve.  Jane's attention to placement, breathing, and comfort in postioning make using her DVD a remarkable experience.  As a massage therapist, I find the content of ""Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams"" priceless!  I appreciate the ability to use segments of the program for specific needs when my time is limited and, conversely, using the entire program when my schedule allows a more complete routine.  I recommend this DVD to all my massage clientele and have given it as a gift to a number of close relatives with excellent response! Thank you, Jane Adams, for compassionately sharing your skill and knowledge!",1324252800,,892,5.089041095890411
4897686,5,B005VT6IYC,"I have tried other gentle yoga DVD's in the past and have always been disappointed.  Jane's gentle yoga instruction is truly that - gentle, yet a complete workout to improve your flexibility, strength and balance in midlife.  I have been a student of hers off and on over the past few years and am thrilled to be able to continue yoga at home when I can't make it to a class.  Being able to select all segments or just a few for a quick workout is helpful.  Her detailed instruction and ""gentle"" manner carries over in this wonderful DVD.",1324166400,,538,4.404040404040404
4897687,5,B005VT6IYC,"I never have enough time to do an entire yoga dvd at once, but this dvd is divided into five sections that are easily spread throughout my day.  Two are great for morning stretch and energy; two help me get rid of tension and find balance after the stress of work; the last is a lovely way to wind down before sleep. Also, since no props are required, this would be a great introduction to yoga for anyone curious about it.  Finally, Jane's instruction always emphasizes how to move in and out of positions safely, while listening to one's body.",1323475200,97,545,4.44

4897690,5,B005VT6IYC,"This DVD is perfect. I enjoy yoga practice with Jane once a week, but now if the weather doesn't allow me to get to class I have a back-up plan. Not only that having Jane in my home via DVD has inspired me to practice more often than weekly. I think the segments work perfectly for those busy days when you can only squeeze in a short yoga session, and I use the warm-up segment every morning to get my body going.

Jane is a very knowledgeable yoga instructor... practicing with her has helped me recover from a back injury, I truly trust her and respect her guidance. My core, leg and arm strength is greater than a year ago and has enabled me to do more activity in my recreation. (For instance I rowed 6-miles along a very slow moving river and had no aches/pains the next day - WOW).",1322352000,,788,4.218543046357616

I purchased this DVD several weeks ago & have been very happy with it.  The gentle yoga is perfect for my arthritis & helps soothe tired muscles. It is also easy to do in a small area, like a hotel room.  Thanks Jane Adams!",1322179200,,395,3.8395061728395063

It is very easy to follow along unlike a lot of other DVD's I have seen.  I also liked that each segment presented different material so you get an amazing amount of excellent instruction on this one DVD.  After being disappointed by so many DVD's in the past, Jane's program really delivers an excellent program.  It is well worth buying and I will be recommending it to others.",1322006400,109,489,4.34065934065934
