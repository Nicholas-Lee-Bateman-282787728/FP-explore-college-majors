2568003,4,B000FILVD2,"I am a big fan of Rich Little; I watched him on television every chance I got, and some years ago, was finally able to see him Live in Lake Tahoe - the man is amazing.  There was a routine he did out of ""High Society"" that I wish I could find on DVD; he played both the Sinatra and Crosby singing roles in ""Well, did you Ever?"" by simply stepping into the screen; it was nothing short of incredible.  This DVD is a great watch - and is there anyone that Rich Little can't impersonate??",1272931200,,485,4.041666666666667
2568004,2,B000FILVD2,"I've always been a Rich Little fan but this one seems a little forced and he forgot quite a few jokes.  Also his impressions are getting as old as he is.  I give it a grade of ""C"".",1213574400,4,180,3.710526315789474

8123220,3,B000FILVD2,"This show just wasn't that funny. He did some impressions that were up to his usual standards, but I didn't like his Bill Clinton, George Bush, and some others. He did great on Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Johnny Carson, George Burns, Jack Benny and some others, but all in all it was just a little better than a fair show.",1496188800,,322,4.383333333333334
