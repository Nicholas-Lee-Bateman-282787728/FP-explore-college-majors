Created by the Fellowship Bible Church from the Nashville, Tennessee area for the Worship Network, it might not have had the budget of a big network TV show but it more than makes up for that with sincerity and feeling.

It's amazing what these people did with a single stage decorated with a few Christmas trees, candles and some nature scenes projected on a rear screen. Most of the mood was accomplished with lighting which tended toward deep blues and purples, giving the proceedings a serene Christmas midnight feeling. Creative and skilled editing lends a dynamism to the visual presentation as experienced by the viewer of the DVD.

The musical program is mostly new songs composed by the singers, many of whom are well known composers from the Christian music community with some traditional pieces as well. A very adept instrumental ensemble of eight players of acoustic and electric guitars, keyboards and percussion accompanies the singers from the sweet delicacy of Christy Nichols' Angel's Lullaby to a really rocking version of O Come All Ye Faithful by Jason Ingram. The singers are also from the Christian music scene and include Ronnie Freeman, Nicole Nordeman, Cindy Morgan and Geoff Moore. Filling out the music is a mixed chorus which includes singers from Africa in the Ring the Bells number (the special was created to raise funds for the church's African mission). Dancers accompany two numbers.

The songs, though mostly new are very memorable and leave quite an impression. The highlight of the show for me is an inspired Little Drummer Boy. Each verse is sung by a different female singer until four drummers take over and then there is a departure as the song becomes a medley with the addition of the rousing Savior Glorious, a hymn by Nicole Nordeman which turns the quiet Drummer boy into a great exclamation of faith before settling back into the quietly fading Drummer Boy melody. It's a version of this Christmas favorite that is unique and unforgettable.

Though not glitzy or full of pop stars, this Christmas special is more than worth a look. I watch it every Christmas and only just bought it again because I tend to give it away to friends.",1417996800,,2287,4.841432225063938
