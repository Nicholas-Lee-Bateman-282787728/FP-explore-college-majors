7837591,5,6303066631,"William Holden is overshadowed by Jean Arthur here. Ms. Arthur plays a woman of independence and leadership, which reminds me of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", and the ""Ex-Mrs. Bradford."" Although she is a woman that takes over, she shows her vulnerability toward her main squeezes that puts her signature on her characters and is unparalleled in cinematic history. I bought this tape because it is not available on DVD, and I am very happy with it.",1272153600,5,476,4.817073170731708

7837593,1,6303066631,"The worst copy I have ever seen.  The movie was of very poor qualify; I  stopped the movie after trying to watch it (it caused my eyes to strain) and threw it in the garbage.

7837594,4,6303066631,"Miss Phoebe Titus (Jean Arthur) is a cross-dresser with big ambitions.  She wants nothing less than the greatest ranch in Arizona.  To raise the money she goes into business, first selling pies to the riff-raff of Old Tucson, then competing for army freight contracts.  Of course, her trail is not a smooth one, or there wouldn't be a movie, in this case an extravaganza directed by Wesley Ruggles (of CIMMARRON fame).  Shot on location in the Tucson Basin, local color is provided by lots of cacti and a cast of thousands who wander pointlessly, but colorfully across scenes clad as Mexicans, Indians, cow pokes, or ladies of the night.
Although neither the Civil War, nor corrupt Apache chiefs can frustrate our heroine for long, the usual coven of stock Western villians create some tension and move the plot forward.  An unconvincing love interest is provided by a man on the move (the young William Holden) who joins the Union Army as an apparent device for varying his wardrobe.  He turns up just when most needed to rescue Miss Phoebe from her own stupidity, releasing her from one of the flick's two bondage scenes.
The history lessons inserted into the film fall flat, and the chronology is confused.  However, things liven up in the second half with the obligatory Indian raids, a spectacular cattle stampede, and, of course, a wedding (the latter borrowed from THE VIRGINIAN).  It may sound like I hate ARIZONA, but, in fact, it's truly a classic Western and, unusual for its time, one with a woman as the action lead.",1044403200,10,1529,4.787072243346008
7837595,5,6303066631,"Jean Arthur is terrific in ""Arizona"" as a strong-willed woman who holds her own out west. She gets her man (Holden) without sacrificing her freedom and dreams.  I suppose one should call the whole thing unconventional. After all, it's a western whose lead character and overriding focus is the heroine (who is also unconventional). So few westerns retain my interest because of the lack of interesting roles for women. Thelength of the film, a common complaint, didn't bother me, I felt the film showed the ""complete world,"" of Arthur's character's life in Arizona while never becoming one of those overblown epics in which the characters get lost for all the action. All in all, I think this film deserves more respect and attention than it gets.",1041552000,28,747,4.928571428571429
