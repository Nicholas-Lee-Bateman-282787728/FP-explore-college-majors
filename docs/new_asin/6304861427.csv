936188,5,6304861427,"This tape has truly blessed my WHOLE family and many of my friends.  It has to be good when you have all ages sit and watch it and laughed.  Teens said they didn't know there were real funny christian comedians.  Isn't  that a blessing? I have to guard my tape from my teenagers friends who want  to take it and show their parents and friends.  I've brought three tapes  and gave them as gifts.  They loved their gift.  God bless Jonathan and his  family.  Look forward to the next one.  The WORD said laughter is good  medicine well this medicine is one I truly love and love to share....  Godspeed.
