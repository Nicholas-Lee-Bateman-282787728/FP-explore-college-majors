8055640,5,B0008D7ITU,"Man, is this film well titled. You cant' get more outrageous than the plot of this film which takes place over two continents while shenagins, robberies and a revolution go on. It's very slapstick but in a good way and I could never anticipate the twists and turns. I liked the fact that the sets are well done and the movie feels less 'scratchy"" than a lot of prints from the 1930s. Overall, a very good value.",1153699200,6,411,4.35064935064935
8055641,5,B0008D7ITU,"""'Laughing at Life' is the ultimate `banana republic' film and is amazing in its scope and topography. The plot of this timeless movie is so delightfully intricate that I had no choice but to suspend disbelief till it was over. The human elements are real and cannot fail to strike responsive chords. I'm completely charmed by what director Ford Beebe has done in this movie.""",1146528000,3,376,4.8
8055642,5,B0008D7ITU,"This is a interesting rare film from the great director John Ford, whose more famous films The Quiet Man and How The West Was Won have been available on DVD for quite some time.

I found it interesting to see a minor film by this screen giant. It doesn't have teh sweeping epic qualities of his blockbuster pictures, but it makes up for that with an offbeat sense of pacing and the way he frames the shots on what had to have been a smaller budget.

I'm glad to have this in my collection.",1146528000,,489,4.191489361702128
