8233588,5,B000YOX3FG,"Absolutely superb.  This will go down as among the best value-for-money purchases I've ever made.  The documentary featuring the late, brilliant, Seymour Hoffman, was particularly excellent.",1419552000,,190,6.269230769230769

8233590,5,B000YOX3FG,"The first set is The Party's Over, with a large cast of characters led by Philip Seymour Hoffman, which brought up a number of interesting issues in American politics. The second film is Encounter Point, which is the best documentary about the Israelis and Palestinians I have seen. My best friends in elementary to high school were Jews, mostly from Eastern Europe, because they were the smartest kids in school. But recently I have had doubts about the right wing leaders in Israel, who have done everything to make life impossible for the Palestinians. The DNA of both groups has to be almost identical since they have been neighbors for many years. Looking at the faces of both groups you cannot tell which is which unless you look at their clothing. They meet to reconcile their grievances and stop killing each other.
The third documentary is about a group of doctors who worked in several countries in Asia, beginning with Afghanistan. Unlike Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld (see the documentary on the fiasco in Iraq ""No End In Sight"" by Charles Ferguson), these doctors were there to help the people.
The fourth documentary ""Inlaws and Outlaws"" about marriage both gay and straight was light but interesting.
I highly recommend this package. I have ordered two more sets of Film Festival Gems.",1379462400,7,1296,4.8954545454545455
