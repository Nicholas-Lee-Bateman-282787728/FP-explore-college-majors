7980380,5,B00008976E,"I LOVE this series, but why charge so much for it? I mean come on! 87$~ for just a few episodes? I understand that the Red Ribbon Saga is like, the greatest set of episodes available in DragonBall, but why monopolize and charge a fortune on it? That's just ridiculous.  I give the item 5 stars only because I love the series, but if it was based on how outrageous the price is, I'd give it 0 stars.",1178236800,,398,4.102564102564102
7980381,5,B00008976E,"I'm very glad uncut Dragonball is now available and on DVD too! I have watched almost all of the episodes edited on the Cartoon Network's Toonami. They were great! I loved them! Then I heard that the uncut version of my favorite saga and my favorite charecter Ninja Murasaki was available on DVD and I jumped for joy! Dragonball is a great series because it blends action with comedy to make a truly enjoyable show. If you've seen the edited version, it's fun to compare the two versions together and see what was taken out. On top of this you can watch it in Japanese too. The subtitles are pretty accurate and I do not think they are dub titles. There is a difference between the english version's spoken words and the English subtitles. In the English uncut Puar says Oolong stole the teacher's papers and in the subtitles for the Japanese version Puar says something about panties. So not only can you compare edited to unedited, but you can compare English to Japanese. Picture quality is great compared to VHS or Cable TV. It's a good price too for a whole saga. Think of how many VHS tapes it would take and how expensive it would be on VHS to colect a saga. Sound is good, but there is a noticable sound quality difference between the Japanese and the English version. That difference is that the Japanese version is in Mono and the English version is in Sterio. It's not that bad though, because most people buying this DVD don't speak Japanese or understand it,and the music is so old it almost sounds the same. I like that they used the original music for the English version. It makes the series intense and gives it a lot of charecter. So if your collecting the entire series of Dragonball or trying to get these episodes uncut and on DVD this is truly a great deal! (such a great deal that I bought and own the Dragonball Tournament set)",1092182400,10,1851,4.479289940828402
7980382,4,B00008976E,"These dvds are an excellent buy for the DB, DBZ, or DBGT fan.  This  set holds the root to the story of the red ribbion army which comes up frequently through DBZ.  seeing this set allows you better understanding of how and why it all started with goku versus the red ribbion army.
the picture quality is tradional to the rest of the series so far.  not anything spectacular.  the sound is sub par.  you feel like you are watching it straight from tv.
but besides that it is fine and to a fan that is all that matters.",1062720000,8,518,4.181818181818182
7980383,5,B00008976E,"This is a double DVD set of the Red Ribbon Army saga. Not to be confused with an actual box set (ie: a multitude of DVDs contained within a box), this is simply 2 dvds in 1 dvd case (a dvd holder on each side when opened). Within it a booklet (well I shouldn't say a booklet, it's just one piece of paper folded in half) that contains the episode information such as episode numbers and summaries.
Now that we've reviewed what it actually is, let's talk about what's contained on the discs. Finally! The original Dragonball available in the original uncut Japanese glory with subtitles! What a deal too! If you were upset with the Dragonball Z dvds only having 3 episodes a piece, you will be more than delighted with this. Funimation brings you 8 episodes on the first dvd, and 9 episodes on the second, bringing you a total of 17 great Dragonball episodes. Apparently they aren't trying to milk this like they are with 'Z', and for all the original Dragonball fans this is a blessing!
Take a step back from all the fighting you see in Dragonball Z, and tag along with chibi Goku on all of his action-packed adventures. Goku takes on the Red Ribbon Army to take back his grandfather's momento (the 4-star Dragonball), and later saves a captured village chief. This saga is full of action, humor, suspense, all with the beautiful art by Akira Toriyama you've come to know and love all these years. This saga is taken from the original Toriyama manga, but with more stuff added only available in the anime.
For $..., and free shipping on Amazon.com, this is one deal you do NOT want to pass up.. especially if you're a hardcore Akira Toriyama fan. You may want to check out the other Dragonball ""boxed sets"" which include King Piccolo part 1 and 2, and the Tournament saga. If I could give this 6 stars, I would.
The only thing I can think of that's remotely disappointing is the extras, which include character profiles and a trailer for another anime (I believe it's Lupin 3rd). The profiles are pretty cool, especially if one isn't familiar with all of them, but I would've liked something special like an interview with Akira Toriyama, or any of the creators of the anime. Let's hope we see some worthwhile extras in the future!",1050105600,28,2231,4.552238805970149
