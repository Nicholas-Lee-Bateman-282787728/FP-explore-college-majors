1192671,3,B000006BSU,"This film is an interesting mix of pre-code dressing, early Hollywood's fascination with Pacific isles and Joel McCray.  Sailor McCray is bewitched by island beauty del Rio when she swims nude around his yacht.  He follows  and wins her but not as he expected.  This film has wonderful island  scenery and the beaufiful del Rio.

The movie is like time travel back to the 1930s where you set out into a polynesia wonderland that never  existed. If you enjoy stunnnibg black and white, and the mercurial Dolores  Del Rio swimming nude underwater, or Joel Mcrea showing off his European  ingenuity to awe-struck natives, this is the movie for you. Don't expect an  honest assesment of colonialism or strongly developed characters. Pure  escape and revery, instead.",959299200,4,552,4.956521739130435
1192673,2,B000006BSU,"When I was a kid, back in the stone age when TV shows were in black and white, NBC ran ""Saturday Night at the Movies"".  My friends and I eagerly awaited these presentations.  The nearest movie theatre was miles  away, and our parents had neither the time nor money to haul us youngsters  to the theatres.
One of my favorites from this TV show was a film called  ""Bird of Paradise"".  The particular version I remember was made  in the early 50's.  The film's location was some beautiful south seas  island, something totally unfamiliar to me, a young child in Wisconsin.  Equally fascinating were the exotic characters that populated this film.
The hero of the film, a sailor, was a decent man who treated the  Polynesians with respect.  His gift of eyeglasses to an elderly man was one  of my favorite scenes.  When the sailor decided to marry the chief's  daughter, he agreed to become a member of their tribe.  The villian, a  witch doctor, was against the marriage.  I can still recall how frightening  that witch doctor was.  He was one of the most scary guys I'd ever seen in  films.  This movie had everything--exotic locations, interesting  characters, and a great story.
""Bird of Paradise"", the '50s  version, made a lasting impression on me.  It showed me a world outside my  own, and strengthend my desire to travel.
I'd like to see this  particular version again as an adult.  Perhaps I'd see it in a different  light--as a cheezy romance, or maybe I'd see a plot with more holes than a  Swiss cheese.  But since it isn't available, I had to settle for the  version offered by Amazon.
The 1930's film is basically the same story as  in the '50s version, however, I was very disappointed.  None of the  characters made a strong impression on me. I kept waiting for that witch  doctor, potent with evil, to appear.  The hero didn't give me the sense he  really cared about the Polynesians and their way of life.  I found it  difficult to sit thru this snail's pace of an ""adventure"".  While  serious film buffs may find this film worth viewing, it did not provide me  with the thrills I was hoping for.  What I was hoping for was to relive a  memory.
I recommend skipping this particular film, but try to see the  '50's version.  A word of caution--my review is really from the perspective  I had as a  9 year old.",944179200,11,2323,4.521844660194175

1192693,4,B000006BSU,"King Vidor's BIRD OF PARADISE (RKO,1932), is a beautiful pre-code production set in Polynesia about an ill-fated romance between a young, American sailor and the lovely daughter of an island chief. The girl, however, has been promised to a native prince, which makes it taboo for any other man to lay claim to her.

In the roles of the star-crossed lovers are Joel McCrea as Johnny and Dolores Del Rio as Luana. Both exhibit a youthful exuberance, and are well-matched in their scenes together which convey an innocent sensuality. Their memorable, nighttime swim is made all the more erotic with Del Rio (or more likely her double) in the nude, luminescently photographed underwater - very similar to the swimming scene from MGM's TARZAN AND HIS MATE two years later. The film was shot on location in Hawaii, and the rainy weather caused extensive delays.

If the premise seems cliched or dated today, it must be remembered that this film was one of the first early talkies to deal with the subject of interracial relationships, and should be viewed with that awareness. In 1932 this was still a controversial issue, and director Vidor handles it with his customary frankness and sensitivity. To label the film as 'racist' is to basically ignore its historical context.

Another noteworthy aspect of BIRD OF PARADISE is Max Steiner's highly exotic music score, which was also one of the earliest. Steiner pioneered the use of music as dramatic underscoring with SYMPHONY OF SIX MILLION (RKO,1932), and would further develop the practice with scores for THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (RKO,1932) and his crowning achievement that put film music on the map, KING KONG (RKO,1933).

As a public domain title, BIRD OF PARADISE has been available for decades on dupey, VHS tapes and DVDs, but Kino/Lorber's Blu-ray edition is the best quality version currently available. Struck from an original 35mm nitrate print, the film still has some minor lines and scratches, but the sharpness and contrast levels register excellently in HD. The only quibble I have is with the soundtrack, which has some distortion noticeable in sections with music, which constitutes about 80% of the movie.

All in all, this disc is a substantial improvement over past editions, and I recommend BIRD OF PARADISE to anyone interested in well-made, early '30's adventure/romance tales.",1392508800,2,2347,5.085714285714285
1192694,3,B000006BSU,"Since every island film has essentially the same story, BIRD OF PARADISE is notable simply for its beauty: the lovely Hawaiian locations, and the physical beauty of Joel McCrea and Del Rio. Max Steiner's front-to-back score serves well despite the admittedly distorted sound-quality.

Rewatch value is high for the night-time underwater swimming scene, which purportedly features an unclothed Del Rio; whether or not it's actually her or actually nude is irrelevant, because it's simply one of the most gorgeous sequences ever filmed: luminescent bodies gliding through moonlit water. The rest of the film is competently-filmed & acted. None of the dialog is necessary or even interesting, so it's just as well that a lot of the film features the half-naked principals running away from their doom (and toward an ever-present hazard of wardrobe malfunction).

Final word: Neither essential nor useless, with at least one standout sequence. 3.5 stars & still worth seeing.",1392076800,,971,5.381578947368421

The picture (video) portion is only so-so though at one point I was thinking it might have come from a VHS tape but I am not sure of that or how the transfer to DVD was made. I really think the picture quality could have been better. The sound also left a lot to be desired and there was a background noise from beginning to end which did not help intelligability.  I am adding this to my movie library as I enjoy the story , as simple as it is  and to compare it to the 1951 version with Debra Paget. I will try this on an upsampling Blu ray player and hopefully get some visual and audio improvement. Considering it is 1932 I am happy to have this edition.",1361577600,3,705,4.0647482014388485

1192699,1,B000006BSU,"Last week I gave away an Electrolux  vacuum cleaner.  It was purchased by my mother in New Jersey in 1968.  It cleaned our homes in New Jersey and Florida for 15 years, and it is still functioning perfectly.  I only gave it away because today's lightweight vacs are much easier to tote.  I tell this story because there was a time in this country when companies took pride in their products and ripping consumers off was unheard of, or at the very least, it seldom occurred.  But the years have passed and companies don't care about quality anymore.  Now it's all about getting top dollar for inferior products that promise you everything and deliver nothing.  Such is the case with Kino's The Selznick Collection.  All five films in this boxed set claim the following:  MASTERED IN HD FROM AN ORIGINAL NITRATE 35MM PRINT PRESERVED BY THE GEORGE EASTMAN HOUSE MOTION PICTURE DEPARTMENT.  If this is actually true I am willing to eat all five DVDs and then the cardboard box itself.  All five films are of substandard quality, some of them so awful that they are barely viewable.  The most disastrous of them all is BIRD OF PARADISE, with the lovely Dolores del Rio, which is not only marred by visuals worthy of bad public domain piracy but is also afflicted with a distortion of its soundtrack from the very beginning of the film, making the dialog unintelligible, to say nothing about Max Steiner's fabulous score, which is distorted beyond recognition.  I have seen public domain copies of this film which are superior to this absolute merde Kino claims came from an original nitrate negative.  Sound and image problems plague all five releases.  The two Technicolor classics, A STAR IS BORN and NOTHING SACRED suffer from color variations which go from a pinkish hue to something that looks like three-strip Technicolor.  At no time during these two films does one get any semblance to real Technicolor or anything close to it.  The best of the worst are LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is not saying much because the visuals are still substandard and so is the sound. It's just that compared to the other three aberrations, these two fare a little better.  But I would like to stress that the entire set is no better than a bad public domain copy of any of these films.  Kino has added no extras whatsoever, not even English subtitles.  It's a no frills package of unacceptable prints at premium prices.  This is an insult and a slap in the face to consumers and collectors.  There should be an agency that handles situations such as this, and Kino should be made liable, and be forced to reimburse EVERYONE who has fallen prey to their false claims and advertising and has purchased these five films, whether singly, or all together in a boxed set.  So be warned, if you spend any money on any of these 5 releases, you are just throwing your money away.  If you absolutely must have one or more of these films, I suggest borrowing them from your public library or renting them and making dubs.  It's exactly what Kino deserves for putting out crap like this.",1357516800,2,3085,4.666666666666667

1192703,5,B000006BSU,"I have no idea why some of the reviews are so negative.
First of all the transfer to Blu ray - It is very good. It's not The Matrix 2012, but it is very sharp, contrasts are good, the scenery is alive, and Kinos release is the best quality this film has ever seen since the originals were played at the ""Pictures"" in 1932.
Second. Bird of Paradise is a wonderful, full hearted film with a larger than life Dolores Del Rio and a perfectly cast Mcrea. I have watched this film many times and King Vidor leaves his signature constantly throughout this film.
I have absolutely no connection with Kino, but if you like this kind of film and not sure which review to choose to make up your mind, PLEASE!! disregard some of the pompous, patronizing reviews on this film/release and GET IT!!

1192704,4,B000006BSU,"To better appreciate BIRD OF PARADISE, you need to step back into time and try to appreciate the world of films 80 years ago. Acclaimed director King Vidor, an exotic Dolores del Rio and a young and vibrant Joel McCrea created a film that must have been shocking for its day.
It's a simple story of boy meets girl but because of their very different backgrounds, the love is doomed.
Joel McCrea's Johnny decides to stay on beautiful Polynesian island after falling in love with the the chief's beautuiful daughter Luana played by silent screen star Dolores del Rio. The leave for a nearby island to consume their love knowing fate will eventually intervene.
BIRD OF PARADISE was filmed in 1932 before the notorious HAYS CODE took effect and Hollywood films were stifled in their ability to portray love and sex. It must have been shocking to see Dolores del Rio swimming nude in the dark waters. It is very tasteful and harmless. Luana is always topless except for a very strategically place lei that she wears. It must be glued in place since it never moves even when she is dancing.
The filmmakers did try for realism. The islanders do not speak English so Luana is wildly speaking some sort of made-up language as Johnny speaks to her in English. Again, remembering the year was 1932, one has to think what must have been shocking in that time and how people would have expected Pacific Islanders to be portrayed. The film probably is dated by our standards of the day but there is a charm to it.
Joel McCrea is at the height of his youthful vigor with a respectable film career to follow. Dolores del Rio career eventually fizzled and this is the first time I had seen her in a film. It's fun to take a step back in time and imagine what this film represented to the movie going public in 1932.",1347235200,4,1798,4.5184049079754605
1192705,3,B000006BSU,"Bird of Paradise, 1932 film

A sailing ship approaches a harbor with a shallow passage. The natives paddle their canoes to investigate. They seem friendly. Then a shark arrives! A man is pulled overboard, but he is saved when a woman cut the rope from his ankle. The Medecine Man feeds the volcano to keep it from erupting. [Others believe a certain level of unemployment is needed for prosperity.] The visitors eat poi and pulpo. There is a dance and music for entertainment. Did a sailor break a taboo? They return to the ship. There are scenes of underwater swimming. [A technical advance?] Johnny decided to stay on the island, they will pick him up when they return. Johnny has an outboard motor on his boat. The arrival of flying fish creates a festival.

Johnny and Luanna go into the bushes and are caught. ""Happy carefree people?"" Can Johnny capture a pig? There is a parade in the village. Luanna is given a cup to drink and then taken away. Johnny is tied to a tree and left behind. Freed, he trades for a canoe. The natives dance. Luanna dances in a circle of fire. An intruder disturbs their ritual! Johnny and Luanna are on an island. [Food and shelter?] They communicate. Johnny climbs a coconut tree. They build a house. Fish are speared for food. They have a goat. Luanna tells about the volcano and Pl [the god of fire]. One day the volcano smokes. Can it be appeased with a sacrifice? The natives beat a drum to send a message. Johnny captures a sea turtle, then returns to find Luanna gone! Johnny follows. There is a threat from a whirlpool, but Johnny escapes. Hot lava flows to the sea. Johnny is captured by the natives and tied up next to Luanna. What will their fate be? Sacrificed to Pl?

They kiss goodbye. The people carry them away. Suddenly there is a shot! Then another! This is strange magic! The pair are rescued by the return of that ship. But the Chief calls for the return of Luanna, and she agrees to follow the rules she was taught. She says goodbye to Johnny to return to her people. The flaming volcano foretells her fate.

This movie was followed by numerous parodies, like that Abbott & Costello movie, and radio programs in the 1940s. Is it barbaric to sacrifice people in order the appease the gods and restore prosperity to society? Does this only happen with primitive people? Christian missionaries may have ended the practice of human sacrifice in some places.",1347148800,,2409,4.582366589327147
1192706,2,B000006BSU,"Around a year or two ago I saw a recent 35mm restoration of BIRD OF PARADISE at the UCLA Film and TV Archives in Los Angeles.  I remember it being of very good quality, both sound and image.  The new Blu-ray sources from a nitrate print held at the George Eastman House, though, as was noted in a previous review, it appears that a duplicate negative was made off of the print and that was the element used to make the Blu-ray.  This would account for why the image has contrast levels that are a bit too high.  Also it would account for the horrible distortion in the soundtrack.  Soundtrack negatives CAN be used for video transfers, but the equipment needs to be calibrated for negative polarity.  Without proper calibration you get all the distortion and noise that's present in the Blu-ray.  This defect also plagues Kino's release of the Buster Keaton Educational 2-reelers.  A shame, because it didn't have to be that way.  Visually, though it's a little shaky, BIRD OF PARADISE probably looks better than any other home video version to date, but unfortunately the sound is just awful and significantly harms the presentation.",1345161600,5,1134,4.744897959183674

the time of the disc's release. boy one of the biggest disappointments ever.

First the film. from the way the NYT review glowed about the film i was
expecting a big A level film like John Ford's ""Hurricane""(1937). what i got
was a poorly made hokey B level film as they were called in the 30s. if
this film was in fact released as an A level film i would be highly surprised.

Second the print. this disc is the perfect of why with really older
films you have to fully restore it before you attempt a blu-ray high def
transfer. there are so many scratches etc... i was shocked they had the
nerve to release a blu-ray disc of such a poor print.

Third the high def transfer. one of the most uneven high def transfers of
an older film film i have ever seen. half the time i was saying to myself-
""this is a blu-ray disc?"". anyone who has seen Universal Home Video's
remastered high def blu-ray disc of ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" knows
what is possible with the technology available today. Kino Video should
be ashamed of themselves for releasing both a poor print as well as such
an poorly done high def blu-ray disc.

Do yourself a favor forget about this film and rent or buy ""Tabu"" or
""The Hurricane""(1937).",1340496000,4,1292,4.304526748971194
1192708,3,B000006BSU,"Even a 80years old movie could looks good (""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""M"") when it's restored.  Well... ""Bird of Paradise"" is a interesting movie with two sexy actors Dolores Del Rio and Joel McCrea and a few interesting supporting actors Lon Chaney Jr., Arnold Gray (Priest in ""She"", Passenger on Yacht in ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and a Reporter in the 1933 ""King Kong"").

Its a love story about a young ""rich"" (?) american who's sailing with his friends to the South Sea and meet a beautiful nativ girl on a island. Both are in love but she's already ""promissed"" to another native man from island...

Handsome looking Joel McCrea is playing the american. His next film was the famous ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (Arnold Gray, here as ""Walker"" is also in ""the Most dangerous game"").

The movie is easy to follow and I guess in his time very exoctical for the audience in 1932. This Blu-Ray doesn't contain any subtitles (like SDH) which is for Blu-Ray (in my mind) a must (!!!).

On the Back-Cover its written, this movie his restored and in HD. Hm... possible its in HD. Its the age? Hm... after I have seen any other 80years old movie who looks much better.. i think there was more possible. Also the Soundtrack could be better. For me (i'm bit hard hearing) it was a bit difficult to understand the dialogues. In other words: I was a bit disappointed.
Many people don't expecting a good quality for a 80 years old movie but its really possible (see ""All Quite..."" and ""M"" or even ""Metropolis"" looks in the most scenes better - except those where was found a few years ago and believed to be lost).

TRIVIA: The native village huts were later reused for the inhabitants of Skull Island in RKO's classic King Kong (Source: IMDB).

1192711,1,B000006BSU,"At last, I thought, I will have Bird of Paradise--one of my favorite films--in a Blu-ray disc that captures the spectacular picture and sound that I remember from several viewings of Selznick's personal print back in the 1970's.  Boy was I wrong!  Selznick's 35mm nitrate print was made after the film was out of release and the original negative showed signs of wear, but it still offered striking image quality and superb sound.

The image quality (if you can call it that) on the Kino Blu-ray is a rain of white marks and the sound is terribly distorted--two indications that the transfer was done from a negative, and not a very clean negative.  Thunderbird films made a 16mm negative from the nitrate print years ago and I'll bet it's that negative used for this disc.  Kino had obviously transferred sound from negatives for Carnegie Hall and some of the Benchley short films.  You'd think they would have learned by now that you can't do that, especially to Max Steiner's magnificent score.

The statement on the package that says, ""Mastered in HD from an original nitrate 35mm print, preserved..., etc."" cannot be true as read, and the result of the transfer is unwatchable and certainly unlistenable.  I have an excellent tape of the entire soundtrack made from a nitrate print 40  years ago.  I would try to sync it up if only the picture quality warranted the effort.

And to anyone who excuses it for being an 80-year-old film: Don't!  This is not how films looked and sounded 80 years ago and there's no excuse for passing this off as good quality.",1337299200,24,1561,4.719557195571956
1192712,3,B000006BSU,"I guess that some people consider BIRD OF PARADISE (1932) to be a ""classic,"" but the truth is that really just an old movie; a ""chestnut"" that has not passed the test of time.

Certainly I can understand why the picture was so popular back when it was first released.  It was produced by David O. Selznick, directed by King Vidor, featured two attractive stars, Dolores del to and Joel McCrea, and it transported movie audiences to an exotic world which they had never before seen.

McCrea plays a world adventurer, who sails to a South Seas island where he promptly falls in love with the island's princess (Ms. del Rio), who has a date to be sacrificed to the volcano god.

Shot in glorious black-and-white, the movie is enhanced by some handsome Hawaiian locales, a memorable score from Max Steiner and a couple of risqu&eacute; Pre-Code sequences, including a nude swimming scene.

But the story itself is dated and rather silly and, for an audience today, politically incorrect.

On the other hand, the new DVD of BIRD OF PARADISE from Kino Classics is certainly the best home video presentation ever of this public domain film.  It was mastered in HD from an original nitrate 35mm print, preserved by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department and licensed by the David O. Selznick estate.  There is some very minor frame damage, but the overall picture and sound are great.

While King Vidor was known for silent films years prior such as ""The Big Parade"" (1925), ""Bardelys the Magnificent"", ""The Patsy"" (1928), to name a few, ""Bird of Paradise"" was a romance/adventure film that was a talkie, would incorporate an orchestrated film score courtesy of legendary composer Max Steiner (known for his music in ""Casablanca"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""The Gay Divorcee"", ""Now, Voyager"") and a film that would showcase successful Mexican actress Dolores del Rio (""Flying Down to Rio"", ""The Abandoned"") and Joel McCrea (""Sullivan's Travels"", ""The Most Dangerous Game"").

""Bird of Paradise"" was an intriguing RKO film for its time as it created some scandal because lead actress Dolores del Rio (playing a Polynesian) was in a scene where she is swimming naked.  In fact, throughout the film, she is wearing nothing but a lei covering her upper torso and at the time this film was released, before the Hayes Production Code was enforced.  Needless to say, even Orson Welles once chimed that ""del Rio represented the highest erotic ideal with her performance in the film"".

And now 80-years-later, ""Bird of Paradise"" receives its release on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of the Kino Lorber.

VIDEO:

""Bird of Paradise"" is presented in 1080p High Definition, 1:33:1 aspect ratio and in black and white.  With that being said, ""Bird of Paradise"" is a film that has been seen by many on public domain copies.  And because this version of the film was mastered in HD from an original nitrate 35mm print, preserved by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department, I have no doubt in my mind that this would be the most definitive version, in terms of video quality, of the film today.

The film is well-contrast with white and gray levels looking very good, while blacks are nice and deep.  There are some issues of white specks that show up  and there are some parts of the film that possibly had a little nitrate warping but nothing bad to the point that it can't be watched.

But the Blu-ray release also features details that I didn't really see on the public domain DVD such as the beads of water on the skin of Luan after swimming.  Even during the dancing sequences, there is much more clarity and detail.

But for a film that is 80-years-old, ""Bird of Paradise"" does look very good on Blu-ray and much better than previous public domain DVD's that I have watched before.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Bird of Paradise"" is presented in 2.0 LPCM monaural.  Dialogue is clear, but not sure but there seems to be a boost in audio and I detected no popping or crackle during my viewing of the film.  Unlike other Selznick Collection releases on Blu-ray from Kino Lorber, I will say that with ""Bird of Paradise"", I did do a slight adjustment of selecting a better setting on my receiver in order to enjoy both the dialogue and the music of Max Steiner.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Bird of Paradise"" comes with no special features but Kino Lorber trailers for other films from the Selznick Collection.

JUDGMENT CALL:

With the release of King Vidor's ""Bird of Paradise"" on Blu-ray, as a classic film fan, it's easy to be excited because we are getting a pre-code RKO film in HD and hopefully paving the way for more films from the 1910-1940's to be released on video.

""Bird of Paradise"" may not be one of King Vidor's masterpieces, considering Vidor is a legendary filmmaker that had films from 1913-1980 and many classic films within his oeuvre.  But for me, ""Bird of Paradise"" makes an impact in another way, and that is through leading actress Dolores del Rio.

Back in those years of filmmaking, Hollywood was gravitating towards European filmmakers and talent and managed to import actress Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman of Sweden, Marlene Dietrich of Germany.  And while it's known that Caucasian actors played African Americans, Asians, Native Americans, etc. in early Hollywood, actress Dolores del Rio was a Mexican actress who was the first Latin American to have international success.  She was also the second cousin of popular silent actor Ramon Novarro.

As Italian actor Rudolph Valentino would make women swoon back in those days, del Rio brought a sexiness to the big screen and not long after her debut, she was already becoming one of the most admired new actresses along with Joan Crawford, Mary Astor, Fay Wray to name a few.

The actress was known for her acting and her singing but at the same time, the rise to fame would affect del Rio's career and personal life to the point where she had health issues which led to the dissolution of her contract with United Artists.

And when RKO Pictures came calling in order to give America the Dolores del Rio contract, in 1932, she met success with ""Bird of Paradise"" and the following year later for ""Flying Down to Rio"" starring Dolores del Rio and Gene Raymond, and a film best known for being the first pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

So, my view towards ""Bird of Paradise"" has always leaned towards a multicultural sensitivity, for one, a Latina receiving top billing for a King Vidor film and a film that would surely regenerate interest towards this sexy siren of the big screen due to the attention the film received for her ""nude swimming"".

As for actor Joel McCrea, 1932 would be a fine year as he would achieve success with two island-related films, ""Bird of Paradise"" and ""The Most Dangerous Game"".

But ""Bird of Paradise"" is a film with '30s adventure and intrigue.  For many Americans, not many of them were familiar with Polynesian culture and a film that revolves around a group of foreign yachtsmen sailing close to Polynesian islands is intriguing but a forbidden romance between the island princess Luana and the American Johnny Baker was sure to capture attention.  A romance/action film, from surviving a shark attack to tribes wanting to kill the leading man for taking away the woman he loves, during her ""arranged wedding"" ceremony, also added to the excitement for viewers at the time.

In fact, the cinematography of capturing the island life in black and white and providing viewers a glimpse of the island of the South Seas was quite significant back in the early '30s.  As F.W. Murnau was able to accomplish in his film ""Tabu"", both ""Bird of Paradise"" and ""Tabu"" have similar themes but in ""Bird of Paradise"", the film tries to showcase forbidden love between a princess and a white man.

While I felt that F.W. Murnau's film was much better in capturing the futility of it's couple, ""Bird of Paradise"" was no doubt a film that relied upon Dolores del Rio's sexiness, because there are quite a bit of scenes that were a bit farfetched, including the quick English tutorial that allowed these two to communicate so quickly and somehow Johnny being able to withstand situations that would leave most men dead.

Still, the film still remains to be enjoyable for its romance and adventure within an island setting but with its somewhat tragic ending, both ""Tabu"" and ""Bird of Paradise"" share that similarity with final decisions that were made.

With that being said, ""Bird of Paradise"" is an earlier Hollywood film were Caucasian and other ethnicities play Polynesians.  While this was common at the time, while Dolores del Rio is Mexican playing a Polynesian princess, considering the year this film was made and multicultural talents were not exactly featured or top-billed, the fact that Dolores del Rio received top billing for this film was quite significant.  But there is a misrepresentation of the Polynesian people,  as they try to communicate with gibberish and possibly popular traditions were not well-researched back then. So, the misrepresentation of the Polynesian people may be looked at as ridiculous to many modern viewers.

But it was the sign of the times and the setting was more or less a ""Romeo & Juliet"" style of storyline and in this case, Juliet was Polynesian, a princess and betrothed to another man, while Romeo is a Caucasian man who is too deep in love to ever give up on the woman he cares deeply about.

As for the Blu-ray release, I never expected ""Bird of Paradise"" to be pristine but while the film does have its share of damage in terms of white specks and age, for the most part, the film does look very good.  It's well-contrast with the whites and grays and black levels are nice and deep, while Dolores del Rio looks absolutely fantastic in this film.  Unfortunately, there are no special features.

Overall, if you are a classic movie fan, and are following The Selznick Collection on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber, a ""Bird of Paradise"" is worth watching, while those who want to watch one of the most well-known Latina actresses receive top billing for an earlier Hollywood film, may want to give ""Bird of Paradise"" a try!",1336176000,23,9542,4.814338235294118

1192719,5,B000006BSU,"Bird of Paradise (1951) with  Debra Paget, Louis Jourdan and Jeff Chandler is an all-time FAVORITE love story that is full of drama in an idyllic setting.  A beautifully told story that was haunting for many of its points of Hawaiian life and customs, and what can happen when it comes up against another culture, our world.  Jeff Chandler was quite a hunk of a man in his day and still leaves me wishing there were more men like him in Hollywood today.  Anyway, I plan to get my copy soon as this is an old favorite love story of another age.  I'm glad Hollywood has not remade this fantastic story and leaves this priceless jewel alone for us to enjoy.  BTW, Louis Jordan was quite the hapless lover (Andre Laurence, a college friend of Tenga) who dared to love Debra Paget (Kalua), the perfect Hawaiian flower, and Jeff Chandler (Tenga) plays her brother and best college friend of Louis Jordan's character.  The great Kahuna was quite the menace, and I felt portrayed the power over life and death--played by great actor, Maurice Schwartz (1890-1960), who was considered the Lawrence Olivier of Jewish theatre in his day.

1192722,4,B000006BSU,"BIRD OF PARADISE is one of those films that remained unseen for years thanks to its pre-code nudity and the fact that a lame 1951 remake made sure that it sat on the shelf. A few years ago VCI Home Entertainment in conjunction with the Roan Group issued a restored version on VHS. This is now on DVD coupled with a 1931 film THE LADY REFUSES. BIRD was David O. Selznick's biggest production to date. He had just headed up RKO Radio Pictures and was looking for something to follow up on the success of MGM's TRADER HORN and TARZAN THE APE MAN. What he decided on was a reworking of F. W. Murnau and Robert Flaherty's adventure/documentary TABU about an ill-fated South Sea Island romance. This gave him the perfect opportunity to showcase the Mexican actress Delores Del Rio who had already been in films for a few years. This was her breakthrough vehicle which led to her role in FLYING DOWN TO RIO the following year. Joel McCrea, fresh from THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, was the male lead.

The film was shot on location in Hawaii at a cost of over a million dollars but managed to turn a profit thanks to Del Rio's nude swimming scene which is still pretty erotic even after 70 years. The rest of the film is quite good as the story of boy meets girl, boy loses girl is made fresh by the Hawaiian locales. Del Rio is simply marvelous as the native girl caught between tradition and her love for Joel McCrea. McCrea is a creditable hero but his best roles were still to come. Look for Lon Chaney Jr in a bit part as a sailor billed under his original name Creighton Chaney. King Vidor, one of the great American directors who started in the silent era, keeps the film moving along primarily through visuals with dialogue kept to a minimum. He is aided immeasurably by Max Steiner's music score which is a trial run for KING KONG. Sexy, violent, and very exotic, BIRD OF PARADISE is a classic example of the pre-code films which were made between 1930 and 1934 before the Production Code was rigidly enforced. Censorship of mainstream American movies would last until 1968. Although now out of print and rather expensive, this edition is the version to get.",1231891200,5,2154,4.494897959183674

1192728,2,B000006BSU,"The film Bird of Paradise, directed by King Vidor in 1932, tells the love story of an American sailor, Johnny, and a Polynesian woman, Luana, daughter of the island's tribal chief. Although they fall in love, Luana ultimately forces herself to leave Johnny because of her arranged marriage to the island's prince, and her father's anger. The plot seems innocent enough, but underneath its bathetic faade, we discover a blatantly racist representation of Polynesian people and a bold display of American heroism. Every aspect of the natives is implausible, from their appearance to their nave and wild behavior, and the ethnocentricity of the Americans in the film is shocking to witness.

 The first and most severe cinematic mishap of this film is its misrepresentation of people from the Pacific Islands. The casting directors cast many non-Polynesian actors in the roles of the Polynesian natives, including the lead female role, Luana, portrayed by Mexican film actress, Dolores Del Rio. Although their poor selection of actors was probably due to unavailability of ethnically Polynesian actors at the time of filming, their unrealistic casting nevertheless detracts from the authenticity of the film. Several scenes depict these ""natives"" stereotypically dancing wildly around a fire. To make matters worse, Busby Berkeley, the film's choreographer, clearly did not invest much time into researching authentic Polynesian dance forms, and what results is a misconstrued and unrealistic Latin-tinged, frenzied body movement, replete with sensual grinding and hip-swiveling. But perhaps the most absurd portrayal of Polynesian people in the film is the scene where the ""flying fish come out."" The film depicts the ""islanders"" screaming wildly in canoes as water splashes and fish fly all around them. The scene is intolerably ridiculous and further detracts from the film's believability.

 The film also portrays Americans as civilized, morally righteous and superior to the islanders, which is slightly more insufferable than the unrealistic depiction of the native people. In the opening scene, the Americans, towering above the water in their big boat, throw some possessions overboard to the natives, who rapaciously paddle their canoes and swim to collect their newfound ""treasures"" of the ""modern world."" Not only does this scene cast the natives in the role of nave children, but it also creates the illusion that the Americans are civilized heroes bringing technology to the uncivilized world. Furthermore, Johnny heralds Christianity as the only true religion and brazenly informs Luana that her religious beliefs are ""crazy superstitions."" When the natives tie Luana and Johnny to poles to sacrifice them to Pele, the local volcano god, Johnny tells Luana not to be scared because Pele ""is not a real god, he's just a hole in the ground."" Johnny then informs her that ""There's only one real God,"" as he vociferously begins reciting the Lord's Prayer. It is hard to believe that this religious fervor comes from Johnny, the sailor who virtually rapes Luana after pursuing her underwater in the beginning of the film.

 Although Vidor directed this film in 1932, which might explain some of the problems with it, many people still believe these images and behavioral representations of Americans and Pacific Islanders to be the truth. Images and representations of people and places, however fictitious they might be, are powerful, and leave imprints on our minds whether we intend them to or not. Furthermore, images and representations tend to become knowledge and, as the common adage goes, ""Knowledge is power."" However, by allowing false images to form our knowledge, we only become prejudiced and ignorant. Therefore, it is imperative that people seek out true knowledge, or else the people of the world will have to suffer through more movies like Bird of Paradise.",1128470400,6,3883,5.336601307189542
1192729,2,B000006BSU,"This movie is about a group of American men who visit an island. The natives greet them enthusiastically and all seems well. One man, Johnny played by Joel McCrea, sees the beautiful Dolores Del Rio and instantly wants her. He decides to stay behind on the island when his friends leave because he is enraptured with her. He learns that she is the king's daughter and is not to be touched by anyone other than the Prince to whom she is promised. Johnny tries anyway and when they are found kissing, Johnny is tied up while the native girl is married. However, Johnny escapes and steals his love away from the ceremony. She is happily in love with him, but she knows that if she stays with Johnny, a curse will be placed on them by the volcano. When Johnny vows to protect her, she is taken by the natives anyway, and he struggles to get her back. The film by now seems standard; it seems that there are always love triangles between the white man and the native girl and whomever she is betrothed to in these films. The slow pacing makes this one suffer even more than the trite plot.

This early film showcases the gorgeous Dolores Del Rio who once said she would never make a talkie. Perhaps it would have been wise not to make this one. For the most part, her character speaks in another language or in very broken English, and she does not come off as the brightest star. Joel McCrea fares a little better, but he is not outstanding.

The film is beautifully photographed, although the print could be better with some restoration. The island is gorgeous, surrounded by the ocean and exotic plants. The camera does not hesitate to capture the opulence of the surface of the water and it even travels under to show sharks and sea turtles or people swimming.

What might shock some about this film is the nudity. There are underwater shots of the native girl skinnydipping which would have never gotten past the censors had the film been made during the production code. The scene is artistically done and no particular parts can be made out clearly. However, it might come as a shock to audiences under the impression that film makers of the bygone era were prudes.",1119916800,4,2167,4.5229591836734695
1192730,3,B000006BSU,"Strange and amateurish in many regards, yet fascinating and engrossing in its own way, this David O. Selznick production is the original ""Bird of Paradise"" -- not the 1950s remake starring Debra Paget and Louis Jourdan, which will make for an interesting comparison if it's ever released on DVD.
The stars of this one, Joel McCrea and Delores Del Rio, make quite a strange pair.  Joel seems like a hayseed just off farm (his dialogue is peppered with ""huhs?"" and ""whats?"" as he seeks to communicate with the mysterious island beauty, Delores).  As for Dolores, she seems to belong in a different, and probably more interesting, movie than this one.  And even her fabled nude swim scene is pretty tame and unimpressive.
The movie was filmed on location in 1930s Hawaii.  Although the focus always seems a bit off, the scenery is still beautiful -- and a good reminder of what Hawaii must have been like before ""they paved paradise and put up a pink hotel (the Sheraton Waikiki by the way).""  There's also quite a bit of underwater photography, which is pretty impressive given that this movie was filmed approximately 70 years ago.
Cheap and fun, this ""Bird"" is worth looking into if you're interested in old movies, and if you'd like to see what David Selznick was up to just a few short years before filming his masterpiece, ""Gone with the Wind.""",1081641600,8,1347,4.739316239316239
1192731,3,B000006BSU,"This DVD gathers two little-known, lesser films of the early sound era.  ""BIRD OF PARADISE"" is an incredibly offensive exercise in exoticized racism, charmingly set in the Hawaiian Islands, and featuring a callow young Joel McCrea as the studly white guy who hooks up with the local chieftain's ""tabu"" daughter (played by Dolores Del Rio, who I find kind of icky).  It's the same sort of dazzle-them-with-modern-gadgets-before-they-throw-us-in-the-volcano plot that was explored a few years later in ""Waikiki Wedding"" (which is a much more charming movie...), here handled clumsily by director King Vidor.  (And I'm not being touchie-feelie or overly sensitive in a hyper-PC way, the racism of the script is very explicit, particularly in the dialog, but also in the plotline...) There's a modicum of interesting, reasonably authentic Polynesian dancing (some of which was choreographed, unremarkably, by Busby Berkeley), and the indigenous cast speaks in real Hawaiian, but in the main part this is simply an exploitative and unentertaining film.  By contrast, ""THE LADY REFUSES"" is a B-movie with a heart of gold, featuring Betty Compson as a London streetwalker who enters an aristocratic family torn apart by a Jazz Age generation gap.  Although the script contorts wildly to avoid offensive language, the underlying content is pretty raunchy, and pretty overt.  Compson had an unusual onscreen presence -- compelling, although not as picture-perfect pretty as the starlet that would later flood Hollywood.  Gilbert Emery, as the family father, Sir Gerald Courtney, is also quite charming.  For folks looking for fun pre-Code material, this is a film worth checking out.",1039392000,2,1674,5.436293436293436
1192732,4,B000006BSU,"Director King Vidor found Richard Walton Tully's play of the same name on which this film is based hopelessly dated and uninteresting. Producer David O. Selznick countered thusly: ""I don't care what story you use as long as the title remains intact and Del Rio jumps into a flaming volcano at the finish"". The stunningly exotic beauty of Dolores Del Rio made her the first Mexican actress ever to become an international film star. Del Rio had weathered the transition from silents to talkies, but due to her accent and somewhat rudimentary acting ability, her roles had to be carefully chosen; this is probably her most memorable available to the public on video. Filmed on location in Hawaii, the movie's plusses lie in its appeal to the senses, namely in the striking black-and-white photography by Clyde De Vinna - he won an Oscar in 1928 for his work on WHITE SHADOWS IN THE SOUTH SEAS - and Max Steiner's richly evocative background score, designed to illustrate everything from Polynesian native dancing to idyllic, romantic interludes. The film was made rather quickly - stars Del Rio and McCrea had other commitments - and the script was was literally slapped together. BIRD OF PARADISE cost RKO more than a million dollars to make, a high expence in 1932; this lush, albeit antique romantic drama has long been overshadowed by the largely inferior 1951 Technicolor remake with Debra Paget and Louis Jourdan.",1017446400,24,1417,4.933054393305439

The disregard for a good story line clearly shows and the result is a boring and tepid film highlighted only by actress Delores Del Rio. Although Del Rio's voice is high pitched and she speaks little English here, her beauty and presence holds your attention. The exotic locales are not that impressive in black and white and some underwater footage was taken from another film, ""The Most Dangerous Game"".
The flip side of the dvd features ""The Lady Refuses"" a low budget ""adult drama"" popular in its' day for presenting provocative story lines. This one involves a wealthy man hiring a prostitute (Betty Compton) to seduce his son away from a gold digger that he is dating. In the process, Compton falls in love with her employer instead.

If you get a good price on a blu ray copy it is worth the upgrade.,1472342400,,276,3.9464285714285716

7903988,4,B000006BSU,"A picture most notable for its beautiful stars:  Delores Del Rio and a stunningly handsome Joel McCrae run around with very little on for quite a bit of the film.

It is also notable for its pre-Hayes-Code freedom:  the sexuality is palpable and the inter-racial love story could never have taken place a few years later.  Just goes to show what a dreadful dis-service the Hayes Office did to a burgeoning film industry.  What films we could have had if that so-called 'morality' had not existed.

Kino has given us a remarkable transfer of the picture, especially considering its age.  But the soundtrack is just awful.  Distorted, too loud, noisy, shrill and harsh.  It is a shame because this would have been a real five-star product if the sound had matched the picture.  I should have given this only three stars, but, even with the sound off, Joel McCrae is glorious to behold.",1466812800,3,883,4.712418300653595
