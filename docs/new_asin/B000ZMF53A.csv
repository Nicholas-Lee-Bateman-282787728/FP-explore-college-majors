8235979,5,B000ZMF53A,"My four children have been raised on Signing Time; every video in the series is great.  My two-year-old requests it every day, and he has come to know several hundred words.  In fact, his main mode of communication is American Sign Language, because of these videos, and his parents trying to speak it when we can.  The series is very well done, with good, catchy songs and graphics.",1387670400,,383,4.602941176470588
8235980,5,B000ZMF53A,"I was pleasantly surprised to find Signing Time series, especially since I use it as a teaching aid in my home daycare. The songs are good and very catchy, and watching Rachel Coleman's finger with the tape on them is very helpful. I highly recommend this for all.",1382572800,,264,4.520833333333333
8235981,5,B000ZMF53A,This is still the same great product as previous dvds! We plan to continue buying more because of their entertaining and educational quality!,1373068800,,141,5.173913043478261
8235982,5,B000ZMF53A,This is a new favorite in our house.  A little more advanced than others as it has some time concepts included.,1359417600,,111,4.285714285714286
8235983,5,B000ZMF53A,"Purchased this DVD to help my students understand the signing of a classmate. We all enjoy the many Signing Time DVDs, they are topic specific, last about half an hour. Real children are shown sighing, so children have many opportunities to read the signs on other children's hands.  Very beneficial to us. Purchased used in excellent condition. This DVD covers the changing seasons and activities of the seasons.",1336089600,,413,5.073529411764706
8235984,5,B000ZMF53A,All the signing times I purchase are enjoyed by my grandsons and they learn a lot from watching cd's. They have helped my daughter understand what her children are expressing too.,1235174400,,179,4.806451612903226
8235985,5,B000ZMF53A,"As always this is a great product. My only complaint is that they are too short!!! The shows are 30 mins ea so when driving it makes it hard to switch DVDs constantly. My son isn't hearing impaired, but he signs like a pro. I like it because while he's learning to speak, i can understand a sign and help him pronounce the words better. It's made learning a snap! He's 2 and can count 1-10 and knows all the ABCs by sight and sign!!!",1205193600,,433,4.105882352941176
8235986,5,B000ZMF53A,"We couldn't get enough of this DVD.  After the first viewing we watched it over and over.  My Favorite Season has so many words to learn in it.  The song that Rachel sings to help you learn the signs for summer, autumn, spring, winter, weather, warm, and more is very helpful.  I love the repetition of the song throughout the whole DVD.  Rachel incorporates many different things into the new season.  The concept of moving time, game time, and counting time is terrific.  Once again this DVD is a must for your signing collection.  Signing Time! just keeps doing it right!",1200355200,3,574,4.6138613861386135
