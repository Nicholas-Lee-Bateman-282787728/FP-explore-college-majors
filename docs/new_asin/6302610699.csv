490391,5,6302610699,"This is one great set. It has two of my favorite Audrey Hepburn Movies (Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's.) I would of preferred My Fair Lady over Sabrina, but I am not complaining. Three great movies[at a great price], what a deal.",1045785600,4,239,4.5813953488372094
490392,5,6302610699,"Hey, I was just looking to pick up a copy of Roman Holiday, when I found that someone had packaged three of Audrey's best movies together.  And I said, ""Three?!  Thats it???  Why not six?  Oh, well...it will have to do.""  So I upgrade Breakfast at Tiffany's from VHS to DVD, and I finally pick up Sabrina, which, despite a small crush on Julia Ormond, I must admit is superior to the remake.
Its easy to see why Audrey Hepburn has remained such a popular film star, and why so many actresses fail miserably to be the ""next"" Audrey Hepburn.  There was only one actress who combined the sense of innocence, sweetness, beauty, humor, grace and charm into one.  And don't we all wish she had made more movies?  And don't we all wish they could still make movies like the ones that Audrey starred in?  No wonder she's still our favorite!
So, in chronological order...we get Roman Holiday(1953), Audrey's breakout Oscar winner where she guaranteed she would be a star, then her next movie, Sabrina(1954), which cemented her as Hollywood's sweetheart, then Breakfast at Tiffany's(1961), simply one of my favorite movies of all time.  I would have liked to have seen Charade, My Fair Lady, and Funny Face included, really I would...will there be a Volume 2??  It would be quite a nice cure for the mean reds.  If you haven't fallen in love with Audrey Hepburn yet, then buy this nice set and you will!",1036713600,68,1393,4.5951417004048585
490393,5,6302610699,It is wonderful that they put all of these videos in one collection. Now everyone can buy them for theirs. I love each and everyone of these movies. They are part of the best of Audrey's carrer. There is not much more I can say but wonderful!,978480000,3,242,4.170212765957447
490394,5,6302610699,"I'll never forget when I fell in love with Audrey Hepburn.  I was 16 and home sick from school.  My mother had rented a bunch of old movies for me  and Breakfast At Tiffany's was one of them.  I knew, from the first strain  of ""Moon River"" as Holly Golightly stepped out of the cab in  front of Tiffany's, that I was hooked.  I watched the movie three times in  the next two days.  I was completely enamored of Audrey's grace, style and  beauty.  Breakfast At Tiffany's has been my all-time favorite movie ever  since (a great cure for the mean reds)!  I still cry at the final sequence  in the rain.
Over the next few weeks I rented every Audrey movie I could  get my hands on, I have seen them all numerous times by now and own most of  them, and Sabrina and Roman Holiday are two of my other favorites.  Roman  Holiday was Audrey's first American film for which she won an Oscar.  She  and Gregory Peck are truly magical in this sweet movie about a Princess out  in Rome for a day of no responsibilities.  Sabrina is the ugly duckling  into a swan story, although ugly duckling is as far from Audrey as you can  get!  While Humphrey Bogart is my least favorite part of this movie (he and  Audrey reportedly did not get along on the set), Audrey shines and her  wardrobe is something to see in and of itself.
I can't recommend Audrey  Hepburn or her movies enough.  If you've never seen her movies, start with  this trio.  If you know nothing about the woman, find out.  She was not  only a wonderful actress but a phenomenal humanitarian.  Her work with  UNICEF should be her greatest legacy.
I know that there will never be  another Audrey.  But I am thankful that her movies will allow her beautiful  personage to live on forever.  But don't take my word for it.  Watch this  trio of movies and see for yourself.  And while you're at it, pick up Funny  Face, Charade, How To Steal A Million, My Fair Lady...",967766400,121,1912,4.3125
490395,5,6302610699,"This film trilogy eloquently captures the spirit and essence of a truly gifted actress. From her naive innocence in ""Roman Holiday,"" to her subtle  poise in ""Sabrina,"" and her elegant sophistication in  ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" Audrey Hepburn personified charm,  style, and grace. She could express her vulnerability with a tremor in her  voice or a pensive look beneath narrow, furrowed brows. She could then turn  playful with a winsome smile and a coquettish peek from beneath a stylish  hat. She possessed a  bewitching, almost regal femininity with her soft,  cultured voice, and sleek, sensuous beauty.
Her chaste romances always  simmered beneath a veneer of gentile civility. Whether surrounded by  Gregory Peck, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, or  George Peppard, she was  at once poignant, sentimental, and mischievous. No actress will ever  capture the heart nor the imagination quite like Audrey Hepburn...",954806400,11,920,5.485714285714286
490396,5,6302610699,"What a wonderful collection for a rainy Saturday afternoon!  It has been said that two women had the most influence on fashion in the last 100 years:  Coco Chanel, and Audrey Hepburn.  If you wear a little black dress,  big black sunglasses, or a trenchcoat, you have Audrey Hepburn to thank!  From the young, fresh face in Roman Holiday, to the transformation to  feminine grace in Sabrina, to the ideal vision of woman in Breakfast,  Audrey is beautiful.  Add Peck and Bogart and you cannot miss!",939772800,8,498,4.709302325581396
490397,5,6302610699,"Where have charm and romance gone ? If you need a pause from  the rough world you live in, these three movies will do the trick !
It is hard to sum up three movie in few words (pictures would more appropriate) but here  it  goes :
- Breakfast at Tiffany : crazy charming girl living with a  cool and smart cat meets handsome and intelligent man...will they ever eat  breakfast together ?
- Sabrina : you probably saw the Julia  Ormond-Harrison Ford remake...you know the plot then: ugly duckling falls  in love with wealthy man, goes abroad to forget him (her dad is his  chauffeur so it would be quite improper for her to really, really fall in  love with Mr. $) and comes back a beautiful woman...but the wealthy man is  not a prince and his brother is...you know the story. However, the Audrey  Hepburn version is much more charismatic: maybe you should watch this movie  again. And visit the greenhouse...
- Roman holiday : for all the little  girls who ever dreamed of being princesses...and big girls who enjoy Italy,  Vespa and Gelati...",914889600,7,1044,4.543010752688172

490453,4,6302610699,"Who doesn't love Audrey Hepburn? My first exposure to her was when I was a pre-teen on a schooltrip and the move showing aboard the long distance ferry was Breakfast at Tiffany's. I was too young and naive to understand what was really going on, but I loved Audrey Hepburn's performance and became a fan.

My all time favorite Audrey Hepburn movie is My Fair Lady, but it doesn't come with this collection. However, Roman Holiday is a close second. It's no surprise that this elegant and amusing movie shot her to fame, and there could hardly be a better pairing than her and Gregory Peck. For all its lightness, its ending is always surprisingly powerful, especially in today's world when to deny oneself anything, let alone the love of one's life, for any reason, is an alien concept.

Sabrina is pure, delicious fun. And, as usual, Humphrey Bogart, perhaps one of the most unlikely leading men in Hollywood history manages to pull off this role. An anecdote from the making of this movie: Bogart was asked what he thought of Hepburn and he said, ""She's all right if you like sixteen takes."" Only Bogie could maintain such a cynical attitude in the face of Hepburn's piquant charm.",1490140800,2,1183,4.6826923076923075

490545,5,6302610699,A remarkable unique actress who had an influence on our culture that younger generations are not even aware of.  Flaws that defied the norm became assets because of this delightful energetic model and actress who lived life on her terms.  She should not only be known as a very talented actress but also remembered as the strong minded kind person that she was working in a culture populated by self serving prima donnas.

490573,4,6302610699,"Until a year or so ago I'd never watched any Audrey Hepburn films.
I'm not going to lie, the constant references to her, and Breakfast at Tiffany's, scattered all throughout the ABC-Family mystery/drama, Pretty Little Liars piqued my interest. So I watched BaT when it was still streaming on Netflix and I fell madly in love with it. Everything about the movie was amazing and full of well written humor. It could also see the connection between Holly Golightly and ""Alison"" on PLL, however Holly is much more likable. Now I'm planning on purchasing the Copte books also to add to my ever growing book collection.

I've never seen either of the other two films that came with it, but I'm sure that I'll enjoy them just as much as Tiffany's. Audrey is just one of those actresses that are classic and wonderful and you can't help but feel some sort of connection to.

The packaging was nice and the discs, and cases were all in great condition. The only reason I left a star off was because the outer box was dented, warped, and even scratched despite the shrink wrap that came on it.",1465344000,6,1083,4.5487179487179485

Look carefully at the picture of the blu-ray box - it has Funny Face printed right on the front lower right corner. Bad work by Amazon, putting the DVD set reviews on the page for the blu-ray set. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME! It's not Mr Uyeshima's fault. The USA and EU blu-ray boxes both have Sabrina, Funny Face, and Breakfast at Tiffany's. The DVD set Mr Uyeshima has reviewed contains Roman Holiday, Sabrina, and Breakfast. I have seen a web post that Roman Holiday has been released on Blu-ray in the EU, and I thought this 'region free' EU release box would be the only way to obtain it, but no - not so. Also, be aware that the aspect ratio of Sabrina is supposed to be different for the EU release than the US release - 4:3 in EU and the correct 1.75:1 in USA.

490679,4,6302610699,"I came to buy this collection but Amazon,com is not giving much description about this product. Only a bunch of reviews which does not address my concerns.  It says 3 discs! 3 discs of what? It says widescreen, but it does not mention the aspect ratio. This is a 70 mm movie (theatrical version) and therefore,I expect the aspect ratio to be either 2.35:1 or 2,21:1. The laser discs (just in case if anybody remembers what I am talking about) offered this movie in original theatrical version in all its glory with Prelude, Intermission, Entr'acte and Exit Music. So those of us who loved this movie could get the full theater experience at home. In this days of widescreen TV monitors, these aspect ratios are important, at least to some of us. Amazon totally seem to ignore about these details when they advertise their products. In some pages within Amazon.com, it says the aspect ratio is 1.85:1.  This cannot be unless the disc makers are messing with the DVD and Blu-ray versions by NOT providing the consumers with the original theatrical aspect ratio.  It is okay to restore these classics if you have to, but stop messing with the aspect ratios.

491135,5,6302610699,"Audrey Hepburn is one of those rare actresses who remains untarnished by time. A lot of actresses have tried to imitate her look, but they couldn't manage the same onscreen grace and skill.

She also was absurdly good at romantic comedies of all kinds, whether playing a polished ingenue, a damaged party girl or an earnest nerd-turned-model. ""The Audrey Hepburn Collection"" brings together three of her most beloved comedic turns -- ""Funny Face,"" ""Sabrina"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" -- which show Hepburn at her most charming and enchanting. The clothes aren't bad either.

""Sabrina"" (Hepburn) is the daughter of the chauffeur at the palatial Larabee estate. She's also in love with the ne'er-do-well second son, David (William Holden), but is sent away to Paris to attend a cooking school. And with the help of a fairy godcount, she gains sophistication, ambition, and confidence... as well as the ability to make a souffle properly (""A woman unhappily in love, she forgets to turn on the oven!"").

When she returns to the Larabees' estate, David is instantly smitten with the poised young lady. But even if marrying a chauffeur's daughter were okay with his family, his brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) has arranged a business marriage for David to finance a newly-patented glass formula. And to make sure David doesn't run off with Sabrina, Linus begins wooing her too... and falling in love for real.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly (Hepburn), a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men every evening, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico. When Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich ""patroness"" (Patricia Neal) -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.

But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her. She's desperate to marry rich to fulfill her fantasies, visits a notorious gangster, and hides that she was an illiterate teen bride whose first husband is still skulking around the place. As Holly's life starts to deteriorate, Paul sets out to show her what her life will be like without real love.

And finally, ""Funny Face"" finds a place in high fashion when fashion queen Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson) decides that the new look (aside from pink) will be highbrow and intellectual. So she and her gang invade a pretentious little bookstore for the shoot and leave it in shambles. Photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) has a brief discussion with the nerdy bookstore owner Jo (Hepburn) -- and decides that she would make a perfect model.

Jo hates the fashion industry (""It is chichi, and an unrealistic approach to self-impressions as well as economics!"") but is willing to be their new model if it gets her to Paris, so she can meet philosopher Emile Flostre (Michel Auclair). Of course, Dick and Jo begin to fall in love -- but his irreverence towards the milieu that she adores might drive a wedge between them, especially the not-so-intellectual Flostre.

Each one of these movies is pure fantasy -- of being a real-life Cinderella (with no approaching midnight), of being scooped up to be a model, and of being the glamorous Holly Golightley (with the assurance that you'll find REAL love by the movie's end). There's nothing deep or serious about any of these movies, except whatever complicating action might get in the way of the romantic ending.

And Audrey Hepburn is, oddly enough, perfectly suited to all three of them -- elegant, quirky and beautiful, but not in an obvious way. And while her ""transformation"" as Sabrina is... well, mostly a new hairstyle and wardrobe, she works well as all three -- a dancing bohemian, a chic young cook, and a sprightly socialite. Admittedly Jo's pseudo-philosophical gibberish sounds a bit clunky in her mouth, but she pulls off the slightly awkward smart-girl thing as well as she does singing ""Moon River.""

The ""Audrey Hepburn Collection"" brings together three frothy little romantic comedies, with Hepburn pulling off three different chic fantasies. A pleasant way to pass an afternoon.",1402531200,18,4114,5.019061583577713

The dvds are perfect and their boxes are in perfect shape, I was just annoyed that the collection box where all the dvds go came to me bent and in somewhat poor shape.

I'm a big fan of Humphrey Bogart, but thought he was miscast in Sabrina.  The movie itself disappointed me only in that the obvious ending was delayed and delayed until the last possible moment.

I liked Breakfast at Tiffany's the least, which is probably because I don't like Truman Capote's writings.  I found the weird characters in the early parts to be so unlikeable that I almost stopped the movie.  The latter part was better, but overall a disappointment.  Even the lovely theme song, Moon River, didn't lift up the movie much.

That said, the purchase price of the set was well worth it for Roman Holiday alone.",1377993600,3,805,4.692857142857143

491365,5,6302610699,"If you don't know Breakfast at Tiffanys, you need to leave your cave.

Roman Holiday co-stars Gregory Peck as a newspaperman who encounters Hepburn, a princess on a publicity tour who escapes her handlers. When Peck discovers who she is, he senses a great story. The Princess had led a sheltered life, so Peck takes her on a whirlwind, fun-filled tour of Rome. During all their adventures Peck falls in love with Hepburn, which puts a crimp in his story. Alas, all fairy tales must end, and Hepburn returns to her handlers to continue her tour.

Sabrina isn't as satisfying. Sabrina (Hepburn) grows up next door to brothers William Holden and Humphrey Bogart, part of a rich family famous for their parties. Hepburn has a terrible crush on Holden, but to him she's just the little girl next door. When Hepburn returns after a stay in Paris, Holden doesn't recognize her and, being the playboy he is, hits on her. Eventually a romance begins--one Bogart is determined to end. Instead, he becomes bewitched by Sabrina's charms, and he doesn't know how to handle it. Eventually he reaches the point where he has to commit or lose her. Unfortunately there's little chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart, who I thought was too old for her.",1361318400,5,1233,4.784037558685446

The other 2 DVDs of the set are free of scratches but I have not played them yet.

But wait, there's a surprise. A couple of days ago I saw the weatherman Al Roker on the NBC AM show and he said if we rub a banana over a scratched DVD and then rub it off, the DVD should play.

491517,4,6302610699,"This is a wonderful DVD set of three of Audrey Hepburn's most popular movies.  It was also an excellent value.  I am a long-time Audrey Hepburn fan, and each of these movies is well-worth watching.  Audrey Hepburn was beautiful, elegant, ethereal, poised, and she spoke beautifully.  There has never been anyone else like her.

Roman Holiday was Audrey Hepburn's first movie, and it's also my favorite.  She and her costars, Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert, were all superb.  The supporting cast was excellent as well.  Audrey plays a young princess on a whirlwind goodwill tour of Europe who takes a day off to play hooky in Rome.

Sabrina was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  I still love it, but I find myself wishing they had cast someone else in the male lead.  The rest of the cast could not have been better.  Sabrina is the chauffeur's daughter who has a crush on the son of the wealthy Larrabee family.  She is sent to school in Paris, and she returns as a sophisticated, stylish young woman.

Breakfast at Tiffany's is not my favorite movie, but I still enjoy watching Audrey Hepburn in it.  Much of the rest of the cast was odd, although the party scene was wonderful.

I did have a problem with the first set I ordered.  All three DVDs are enclosed in one DVD case, and two of the DVDs had come loose inside the case.  They were rattling around when they arrived, and they were badly scratched. It was not the shipper's fault.

The replacement process went quickly and smoothly.  Amazon provided a return label for the damaged order, and they shipped the replacement right away.  I received the replacement two days later, and I am happy now.  The new DVD case has issues; the inside leaf is falling out, but the DVDs are undamaged, and I am content.  I gave only 4 stars because of the problems with the case design; otherwise, I'd have given it 5 stars-- picky, picky.",1340755200,4,1884,4.525222551928783
491518,5,6302610699,"Tiffany's and Holiday are of course classics.

Sabrina stretches believability to the point of breaking.  Audrey Hepburn with Bogie???  He looks old enough to be her grandfather!

Side Note according to Wm Holden's bio: He and Hepburn fell in love while filming Sabrina and she wanted to get married and have children.  He didn't tell her until the film was a wrap that he mislead her -- he had a vasectomy -- therefore, no kids.  She immediately ended the affair.",1340236800,,464,4.7375

491597,3,6302610699,"It's hard to review movie collections, but I will do my best.
Breakfast at Tiffany's is an iconic film, perhaps Hepburn's most famous and best loved of all her films.  Unfortunately, I hated it.  The characters are completely shallow and self-absorbed and utterly unlikeable.  In any other film, Mickey Rooney's horrible stereotype of a Japanese landlord would be the worst thing in sight, but here it has competition.  The plot, the script, even sometimes the acting itself are horribly sub-par.  How could so many love such a film?  I think it's because it seems to draw inspiration from ""The Catcher in The Rye"" (another horribly overrated work) with the directionless characters, the uninspired plot, and even the use of phony.  But I digress.  The positive: Moon River and the cat.  Can't save the movie, though.  One star *

Roman Holiday, though, remains my favorite Hepburn movie to date.  She is captivating and lights up the screen along with Gregory Peck.  Their romance is engaging and enchanting and funny, all set in beautiful Rome.  What other movie has the heroine smash someone with a guitar?  Five stars *****

Sabrina is a good movie, worth watching, but it lacks something.  Audrey is wonderful and Wilder uses her to great effect here, especially his close-ups of her in the tree (she has the most expressive eyes) and in her stunning dress at the party. I love Bogart, but he doesn't fit well in this movie; the chemistry certainly is not there-- apparently he disliked Hepburn and thought she couldn't act.  They both act well, but don't carry the romance.  There's too many incestuous overtones, especially in the repeated line, ""It's all in the family.""  Ellen Corby's character, Miss McCardle feels made for Thelma Ritter.  The pace drags at some points of the movie.  And lastly, it feels overshadowed by Love in the Afternoon, Wilder's better Audrey Hepburn picture.  Three stars ***",1303344000,,1911,4.940251572327044

491721,5,6302610699,"Audrey Hepburn was -- and remains -- the perfect illustration of elegance and sophistication in Hollywood. A lot of actresses have tried to imitate her look, but they couldn't manage the same onscreen grace and skill.

And the ""Audrey Hepburn Collection"" brings together three of the films that helped shape that image. Okay, they're not her most impressive. But all three are all funny, charming, romantic movies, and they are also the ones that Hepburn is still best known for doing.

Bored young Princess Ann (Hepburn) goes on a ""Roman Holiday,"" when she gets upset, is sedated by a doctor, and has an odd reaction to it. Soon she has wandered out of the palace and into the streets of Rome, where she is found by struggling American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Since she appears to be drunk, he takes her home.

When Joe realizes that he has the missing princess in his apartment, he takes her on a whirlwind tour of Rome, with his pal taking photographs for a full article. But he doesn't count on falling in love with Ann. And Ann has a tough choice to make -- should she give up her royal life and stay with Joe, or fulfil her responsibilities as a princess?

""Sabrina"" (Hepburn) is the daughter of the chauffeur at the palatial Larabee estate. She's also in love with the ne'er-do-well second son, David (William Holden), but is sent away to Paris to attend a cooking school. And with the help of a fairy godcount, she gains sophistication, ambition, and confidence... as well as the ability to make a souffle properly (""A woman unhappily in love, she forgets to turn on the oven!"").

When she returns to the Larabees' estate, David is instantly smitten. But even if marrying a chauffeur's daughter were okay with his family, his brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) has arranged a business marriage for David. And to make sure David doesn't run off with Sabrina, Linus begins wooing her too... and falling in love for real.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly, a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico. When Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich patroness -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.

But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her. She's desperate to marry rich, visits a notorious gangster, and hides that she was an illiterate teen bride. As Holly's life starts to deteriorate, Paul sets out to show her what her life will be like without real love.

Yes, they are all romantic comedies, completely unrelated except that all three have Audrey Hepburn. But all three are fun, well-written (""You can't live here! I live here!"" ""Hi, neighbor!""), and charming. They're good for daydreaming as well, since they take place in chic apartments, palatial mansions and the streets of Rome.

The movies are definitely romantic -- one theme they share is love that doesn't come easily, whether the problem is one of the people involved, parents or overprotective staff. There's also slapstick comedy (like David sitting down on champagne flutes and injuring his butt), and more sophisticated comedy (like when Anna and Joe pretend that they were speeding on their way to get married).

Unlike many actresses, Hepburn's best-known roles were NOT all alike, nor were they all carbon copies of her. Even when we shouldn't really like the characters, she gave them warmth, sensitivity and likability that can't be faked. And she could be very funny too -- it's hard not to laugh when Holly yells ""Timber!"", as a drunken guest keels over.

The Audrey Hepburn Collection is the ideal trio of movies for people who are just falling in love, or who appreciate a good romantic comedy. Charming, cute and sweet.",1171497600,3,3817,4.838957055214724

491755,5,6302610699,"What could be more pleasurable than watching screen legend Audrey Hepburn in her most career-defining roles? This is a great three-movie set at a great price, as all three are deserved romantic comedy classics directed by masters - William Wyler, Billy Wilder and Blake Edwards. Her natural charm and grace are pervasive throughout and further proof that she was among the most consistently affecting of actresses. In my humble opinion, there will be no one like her again.

In a beautifully restored print, 1953's ""Roman Holiday"" provides a most enchanting introduction to the then-24 year old actress thanks mainly to director William Wyler's expert direction and Dalton Trumbo's sweetly observant script. In hindsight, it is a modest performance compared to Hepburn's later work, but Wyler knew enough to let her natural breeding serve its purpose in conveying the carriage of a princess. It works wonderfully, as she is perfectly believable as a royal who experiences her first glimpse into the world outside her hermetically sealed world. The revelation here is really Gregory Peck, handsome and stalwart as always but in this movie quite relaxed with a surprising light comedy touch. It is actually his Joe Bradley that goes through the dramatic character arc that makes the ending so bittersweet. Even though this film is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his other classics like ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", Wyler's humanistic touch is everywhere - from the comic haircutting scene with the smitten barber to the famous Mouth of Truth scene where Peck pretends to lose his hand to the concluding press conference, which turns into a dance of acting nuance and unspoken feelings. This DVD has the most extras, including an excellent documentary on the production itself (watch for Hepburn's first Hollywood screen test) and other short films on the film's restoration process and Edith Head's contribution to Hollywood costuming.

With its cynical humor and the European-based sensibilities around different classes, 1954's ""Sabrina"" is most definitely a Billy Wilder picture. The film is not quite in the same league of other Wilder classics like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Some Like It Hot"" or ""The Apartment"", but on its own, it's an airy souffle of a comedy served on a perfectly lovely warming dish. What I like most about this movie is that Wilder keeps the fairy tale trappings of the story grounded in mordant wit and shrewd observations about business mergers, bribery and class snobbery. This is what keeps this movie surprisingly fresh. Torn between the characters played by her leading men, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, Hepburn as a chauffeur's daughter is charming. This was her first introduction to Givenchy fashion onscreen, and the difference in her appearance between ""Roman Holiday"" and ""Sabrina"" is actually more startling than the one in the movie itself. It is no wonder she became such a style icon from that point forward. While Bogart is too dour in his role of older brother Linus (a role pegged for Cary Grant who canceled at the last minute, damn the luck), Holden is hilarious as shallow, ne'er-do-well younger brother David. The ending is inevitable, but leave it to Wilder to mix sweet and sour better than a Cantonese restaurant. There is a brief making-of documentary on this DVD.

1961's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" has the most contemporary and provocative story of the three, yet it seems the most dated perhaps because director Blake Edwards tries awfully hard to capture the upscale bohemian atmosphere of early sixties New York. In a role that author Truman Capote wanted to cast Marilyn Monroe, Hepburn is delightful as the aptly named Holly Golightly and somehow dances around the fact that her character is a high-priced call girl through her sense of style, fun and vulnerability. Holly's fear of commitment is the crux of this story, even though she is hopelessly drawn to a failed writer played by George Peppard, who is kept in fine style by a wealthy matron played with conniving sophistication by Patricia Neal. I still think Peppard is the weak link here as he doesn't have the light touch required to keep up with Holly's shenanigans. The rest of the cast can be best described as eccentric, in particular, Buddy Ebsen (pre-Jed Clampett) as Holly's backwoods first husband and Mickey Rooney as the Japanese neighbor upstairs. As a Japanese-American myself, I have to admit I find Rooney's Japanese make-up a bit much, but his accent is spot-on and his casting consistent with the loopiness of this film. Henry Mancini's romantic music provides the perfect accompaniment, and Hepburn's plaintive, ukelele-strummed version of ""Moon River"" is still the most definitive. Of the three films, this one has the most romantic ending, and the rain-soaked kiss in the alley is just about as lovely a scene as you are likely to see in movies. Sadly there are no extras on this DVD other than the trailer.

This set is highly recommended obviously for fans of Hepburn but also for those who can appreciate Hollywood classics in the romantic comedy genre.",1157846400,95,5104,5.065398335315101

491758,5,6302610699,"Audrey Hepburn was -- and remains -- the perfect illustration of elegance and sophistication in Hollywood. A lot of actresses have tried to imitate her look, but they couldn't manage the same onscreen grace and skill.

And the ""Audrey Hepburn Collection"" brings together three of the films that helped shape that image. Okay, they're not her most impressive. But all three are all funny, charming, romantic movies, and they are also the ones that Hepburn is still best known for doing.

Bored young Princess Ann (Hepburn) goes on a ""Roman Holiday,"" when she gets upset, is sedated by a doctor, and has an odd reaction to it. Soon she has wandered out of the palace and into the streets of Rome, where she is found by struggling American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Since she appears to be drunk, he takes her home.

When Joe realizes that he has the missing princess in his apartment, he takes her on a whirlwind tour of Rome, with his pal taking photographs for a full article. But he doesn't count on falling in love with Ann. And Ann has a tough choice to make -- should she give up her royal life and stay with Joe, or fulfil her responsibilities as a princess?

""Sabrina"" (Hepburn) is the daughter of the chauffeur at the palatial Larabee estate. She's also in love with the ne'er-do-well second son, David (William Holden), but is sent away to Paris to attend a cooking school. And with the help of a fairy godcount, she gains sophistication, ambition, and confidence... as well as the ability to make a souffle properly (""A woman unhappily in love, she forgets to turn on the oven!"").

When she returns to the Larabees' estate, David is instantly smitten. But even if marrying a chauffeur's daughter were okay with his family, his brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) has arranged a business marriage for David. And to make sure David doesn't run off with Sabrina, Linus begins wooing her too... and falling in love for real.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly, a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico. When Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich patroness -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.

But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her. She's desperate to marry rich, visits a notorious gangster, and hides that she was an illiterate teen bride. As Holly's life starts to deteriorate, Paul sets out to show her what her life will be like without real love.

Yes, they are all romantic comedies, completely unrelated except that all three have Audrey Hepburn. But all three are fun, well-written (""You can't live here! I live here!"" ""Hi, neighbor!""), and charming. They're good for daydreaming as well, since they take place in chic apartments, palatial mansions and the streets of Rome.

Unlike many actresses, Hepburn's best-known roles were NOT all alike, nor were they all carbon copies of her. Even when we shouldn't really like the characters, she gave them warmth, sensitivity and likability that can't be faked. And she could be very funny too -- it's hard not to laugh when Holly yells ""Timber!"", as a drunken guest keels over.

The Audrey Hepburn Collection is the ideal trio of movies for people who are just falling in love, or who appreciate a good romantic comedy. Charming, cute and sweet.",1146268800,18,3424,4.807823129251701

Breakfast at Tiffany's and Roman Holiday are classics. I wouldn't need to use a lot of adjectives to describe them.

Sabrina I didn't like as much. I've seen the newer version, played by Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear and I preferred it. Somehow, the older version didn't strike a chord. I didn't really see how Humphrey Bogart fell in love with Audrey Hepburn. It seems like she's just a girl who learns to break an egg and to dress well. Not too impressive.

Nevertheless, if you are an Audrey Hepburn fan, the movie is worth watching.

The DVDs are of good quality. The packaging is nice.

I would say this would make a good gift for any Audrey Hepburn fan.",1122076800,2,770,4.4714285714285715
491828,5,6302610699,"Audrey hepburn is gorgeous. That having been said, these movies have other redeeming qualities as well. If you have not seen any of these movies, $26 is a bargain to add these classics to your collection. I would like to rebuttal a reviewer below, who criticized Breakfast at Tiffany's of racism merely because the main source of humor comes in a slapstick manner from an Asian man played by Mickey Rooney. If the man had been white, it would been just as funny, and I wouldn't have written a stern review complaining about how people pick on the poor white man and how ""disgusting"" it is. I believe it would have been just as funny had Rooney portrayed an African American, no one would have hesitated to laugh then, fearing to offend the entire race. I don't personally think that the movies intention was to stereotype Asians as ""buck-toothed, nearsighted minstrels."" I'm from east Tennessee and some of the rest of the country likes to stereotype residents of my area as Buck-toothed, red-necked, un-""edjukated"" individuals, but you don't see me up in arms on the Deliverance page. To conclude, these movies are wonderful and Mickey Rooney will offend only the most sensitive of Anti-racism, Pro-Asian activists (which i assume will amount to only about 7 people) Lighten up, buy the movies.",1098489600,6,1295,4.864253393665158
491829,5,6302610699,"What could be more pleasurable than watching screen legend Audrey Hepburn in her most career-defining roles? This is a great three-movie set at a great price, as all three are deserved romantic comedy classics directed by masters - William Wyler, Billy Wilder and Blake Edwards. Her natural charm and grace are pervasive throughout and further proof that she was among the most consistently affecting of actresses. In my humble opinion, there will be no one like her again.

In a beautifully restored print, 1953's ""Roman Holiday"" provides a most enchanting introduction to the then-24 year old actress thanks mainly to director William Wyler's expert direction and Dalton Trumbo's sweetly observant script. In hindsight, it is a modest performance compared to Hepburn's later work, but Wyler knew enough to let her natural breeding serve its purpose in conveying the carriage of a princess. It works wonderfully, as she is perfectly believable as a royal who experiences her first glimpse into the world outside her hermetically sealed world. The revelation here is really Gregory Peck, handsome and stalwart as always but in this movie quite relaxed with a surprising light comedy touch. It is actually his Joe Bradley that goes through the dramatic character arc that makes the ending so bittersweet. Even though this film is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his other classics like ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", Wyler's humanistic touch is everywhere - from the comic haircutting scene with the smitten barber to the famous Mouth of Truth scene where Peck pretends to lose his hand to the concluding press conference, which turns into a dance of acting nuance and unspoken feelings. This DVD has the most extras, including an excellent documentary on the production itself (watch for Hepburn's first Hollywood screen test) and other short films on the film's restoration process and Edith Head's contribution to Hollywood costuming.

With its cynical humor and the European-based sensibilities around different classes, 1954's ""Sabrina"" is most definitely a Billy Wilder picture. The film is not quite in the same league of other Wilder classics like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Some Like It Hot"" or ""The Apartment"", but on its own, it's an airy souffle of a comedy served on a perfectly lovely warming dish. What I like most about this movie is that Wilder keeps the fairy tale trappings of the story grounded in mordant wit and shrewd observations about business mergers, bribery and class snobbery. This is what keeps this movie surprisingly fresh. Torn between the characters played by her leading men, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, Hepburn as a chauffeur's daughter is charming. This was her first introduction to Givenchy fashion onscreen, and the difference in her appearance between ""Roman Holiday"" and ""Sabrina"" is actually more startling than the one in the movie itself.  It is no wonder she became such a style icon from that point forward. While Bogart is too dour in his role of older brother Linus (a role pegged for Cary Grant who canceled at the last minute, damn the luck), Holden is hilarious as shallow, ne'er-do-well younger brother David. The ending is inevitable, but leave it to Wilder to mix sweet and sour better than a Cantonese restaurant. There is a brief making-of documentary on this DVD.

1961's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" has the most contemporary and provocative story of the three, yet it seems the most dated perhaps because director Blake Edwards tries awfully hard to capture the upscale bohemian atmosphere of early sixties New York. In a role that author Truman Capote wanted to cast Marilyn Monroe, Hepburn is delightful as the aptly named Holly Golightly and somehow dances around the fact that her character is a high-priced call girl through her sense of style, fun and vulnerability. Holly's fear of commitment is the crux of this story, even though she is hopelessly drawn to a failed writer played by George Peppard, who is kept in fine style by a wealthy matron played with conniving sophistication by Patricia Neal. I still think Peppard is the weak link here as he doesn't have the light touch required to keep up with Holly's shenanigans.

491830,1,6302610699,"I never write review here but I had to point something out. I am a fan of Audrey Hepburn but there are many reasons why I think that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" was a poor movie. Some of which is that a bad story line is made beautiful by use of the perfect music, perfect lighting, perfect camera filters, perfect actors, etc. Hollywood has perfected the art of emotion manipulation and this movie would be the pinnacle of the art.

 But the main reason that pushed me to write an review was that Mickey Rooney portrays an Asian landlord as buck-toothed, near-sighted minstrel. Do we still laugh at African Americans depicted in blackface minstrel in anyother classics? But yet most current audience / reviewers still think Mr. Rooney's depiction of Asian character was hilarious (please read other's reviews). How is this possible?

 I don't blame Audrey Hepburn, Mickey Rooney or even the director as racists. They would have to have been an very advanced social thinker to notice the offensiveness of their portrayal in their time. But I do blame the current audience for not finding it offensive now. Ask yourself if you are an intelligent thinking person but still find Mickey Rooney's character funny and why.

 I am force to post this review in the future to point this issue out. This isn't to hit you over the head with my point. But old reviews get buried over with newer reviews and this is an issue that should not be buried.

491832,5,6302610699,"If you love Audrey Hepburn and enjoy watching classic love stories of a by-gone era, get this collection.  While by no means a definitive Hepburn film collection, it will give you the three most popular (and my personal favorite) DVD's, illustrating the pinnacle of Hepburn's work.  If you're not that familiar with Hepburn (where have you been..?!), this is a splendid beginning for a lifetime's love affair with the classically stunning actress who stole all our hearts and made us believe in grand, Hollywood-movie style love.  ""Roman Holiday"" is a Cinderella-type story, except Hepburn is the Princess looking for her average-Joe Mr. Right (and she doesn't do too shabbily with Gregory Peck!).  ""Sabrina"" (this is the best version--but see the re-make with Harrison Ford & Julia Ormond to compare) is Hepburn's rags-to-riches tale come to life with the help of great actors, Bogart and Holden.  The story will sweep you off your feet as you watch the tale of young girl who comes to learn the meaning of true love in the most unexpected way (I can only say SO much without giving the story away!).  And, of course, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a lovely story about a young woman who expends all her energy trying to live a glamourous & fabulous life to hide the fact that she is missing the one thing she wants most (take a wild guess what that is).  Even the most jaded of you will leave these movies with a sparkle of romance ignited in you.  By no means a ""chick-flick"" set, this is a collection not to be missed by fans and movie lovers alike.  A great set--don't miss it!  If you want more Hepburn movies along the same plot lines, check out ""Funny Face"" (with Fred Astaire), ""Charade"" (with Cary Grant; this was recently re-made with Mark Wahlberg under the title ""The Truth About Charlie"") & ""My Fair Lady"" (with Rex Harrison).  To explore more of Hepburn's range in acting, I'd recommend ""The Nun's Story"" (awesome!), ""The Children's Hour"" (with a young Shirley MacLaine), and ""Wait Until Dark"" (super, super film!).",1070668800,26,2027,4.7793696275071635

491834,5,6302610699,"Audrey Hepburn has been remembered all throughout her career for her beauty, poise, and exceptional presence. Though she did other romantic movies, and other comedies, these three are the most alike in tone -- happy, funny, sad and always, always sweet.
""Roman Holiday"" features young Princess Anna (Hepburn) who is being taken through Rome on a boring round of interviews, tours and appearances. After being given a sedative, she wanders out (intoxicated by the drug) into the Roman streets and is found by a struggling American journalist, Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). The next morning he realizes that the intoxicated schoolgirl is the missing princess. The two of them go on a tour of Rome, where he takes a series of unique photos. But when they begin to fall in love, what will Anna choose -- her duty or her love?
""Sabrina"" is perhaps the best of the three. Sabrina Fairchild (Hepburn) is the naive daughter of the Larrabee family chauffeur, hopelessly in love with the playboy David Larrabee (William Holden). But after a few years at a cooking school in Paris, the ugly duckling becomes a swan: She's beautiful, confident, poised, and David instantly falls for her. However, his family has affianced him to an heiress, and so David's brother Linus (Humphrey Bogart) tries to distance her from him. The problem is, Linus is starting to fall for Sabrina himself.
""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" while not particularly faithful to the original story, is nevertheless a sweet story. A writer/kept man named Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into an apartment building, and befriends a party girl named Holly Golightly. He begins to fall for Holly, though he soon discovers that she has an obsessive older ex-husband, and is planning to marry an extremely rich man. But Paul can see through the gold-digging and commitmentphobia to the woman underneath -- but will she be willing to love him back?
In all three movies -- no matter the character -- Hepburn embodies sweetness and a kind of innocence. No matter how worldly the girl, she always seems to have that wide-eyed innocence. She sparkles, in a way that few actresses can. Her costars Peck, Peppard and Holden play off her wonderfully, with amazing chemistry; Bogart less so, probably because he disliked Hepburn in real life.
The movies are definitely romantic -- one theme they share is love that doesn't come easily, whether the problem is one of the people involved, parents or overprotective staff. There's also slapstick comedy (like David sitting down on champagne flutes and injuring his butt), and more sophisticated comedy (like when Anna and Joe pretend that they were speeding on their way to get married).
Hepburn did a lot of other movies -- some of them theoretically better, like the frightening ""Wait Until Dark,"" the sizzling ""Charade"" and suspenseful ""Children's Hour."" But these movies are what people think of her as, and they remain funny, sweet, romantic and thoroughly enjoyable.
