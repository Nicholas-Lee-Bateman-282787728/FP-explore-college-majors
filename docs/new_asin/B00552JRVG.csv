This DVD will NOT PLAY beyond Lesson 7.
HALF of the DVD is USELESS.
With a short return window, I would NOT recommend purchasing from this series!",1524787200,,249,4.413043478260869
8457301,5,B00552JRVG,"UPDATE (Feb 17, 2017): The results: I have been practicing various exercises from this DVD for about two (!) weeks. This week in my regular ballet class, after adagio, my teacher told me: ""There is no reason why you should not be able to do doubles!"" I think his short phrase sums up my original lengthy review. Finis's instruction works!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I am an adult absolute beginner who have studied with the Finis Jhung ballet technique DVDs for over a year now: I have been slowly working through red series (introductory lessons in technique and strength for absolute beginners), yellow series (lessons in basic ballet skills), and purple series (individual applications). Working with these DVDs enabled me to understand and progress faster in my regular weekly group class. I am very excited to have finally reached the blue series, devoted to Pirouettes: it seems that for us, adult people with no prior ballet experience, getting to do a pirouette is something of a rite of passage and a source of much excitement.

Before my review, a clarification: Finis has three DVDs dedicated to Pirouettes: 1, 2, and 3. The correct order in which they should be viewed for learning, however, is: 2, then 1, then 3. Pirouette class 2 breaks down the pirouette into its fundamental elementswhich then could be practiced en dehors (Pirouette Class 1) and en dedans (Pirouette class 3).

Now, the DVD itself: it delivers what it promisesand then some: First, Finis indeed breaks down the pirouette into the most fundamental elements: he methodically goes from the position of the head, shoulders, hips, knees, and feetand on each of these levels, he discusses the specific role that each of these places play in the composition of the movement. Not the least, Finis speaks about the role of breath in turning: just try to pirouette on inhale, and then on exhale  to see the tremendous difference it makes in the quality of the move!

Second, Finis stops to explain what specifically needs to be done when something goes wrong: e.g., he points out the specific muscle groups that need to be engaged to reduce the wobbling of feet during spotting, or placement of the knee and shoulder that addresses the problem of falling to the side, the need to go down-down-down to reduce falling backwards. This advice is simply invaluable! (My personal aha-moment happened when, following Finis recommendation, I detached the movement of my head and art from that of my shoulder: not only did I go around all the way, without falling over, but the resulting pirouette was much quieter and more stable.)

Third, Finis employs very creative teaching technique: shuffling around to learn snapping of the head, or using promenade position as a preparatory rehearsing movement for pirouetting, is just brilliant. So simple, yet, so effective!

In sum, Finis dissects and puts back together the pirouette, but in the process, the whole thing comes alive anew. I personally feel this is the teaching I needed to understand this complex movement. There is simply not enough time in the ordinary ballet class (especially on the group level) to have such an in-depth treatment. My hat also goes to Sachiko Kanai: just watch her doing those pull-ups and push-ups without losing the classical ballerinas poise!

I have made several mental notes for practicing this pirouette DVD in the future:
- The foot work is very demanding, so a good warm up (at least some plies and tendus) is strongly recommended
- Sachiko Kanai is a much stronger dancer than I am. So, so I will have to stay with the first six lessons (that deal with correct placement, body alignment, and not the least sheer muscular strength in the feet and deep hip muscles), for a while before I can progress any further
- Since I don't have Finis to watch and correct me, and I cannot see myself in the mirror at all times, I am going to ask my husband to videotape my pirouettes: then I can watch myself and make adjustments, in light of what I am learning from this DVD.

I end my review with the response to the question that I was asked by a fellow beginner ballet dancer just a few days ago. She asked me if I lost my marbles spending $40 on a pirouette DVD, when I could just google how to pirouette to get hundreds of videos on the subject. Well, she is right in a way: Finiss DVDs are expensive even in the world of ballet recordings, and there are indeed countless free you-tube offerings.

Yet, I am convinced that I have done the right thing. The blessing and the curse of the Internet is the lack of gate-keepers. In the world of social media, everyone is an expertwhether or not they have a long-term basis (and not just a couple of years) of doing something. Among people who teach beginner adult students, Finis has some of the highest credentials, not only in doing ballet himself (over 9 years of professional career), but also in teaching it (44 years)! The hallmark of his teaching is the systematic building up of strength, balance, and skillnot just a few disjointed tips.

Ballet is a very exacting art: not doing things correctly means not only that you won't progress well, but also that you make yourself more vulnerable before injury. I started ballet training at the age of 40: I know I will never become a professional dancer, but I want to dance as welland as longas I can. So, I choose to study with Finis, the man who knew how to prepare 10-year old boys for Billy Elliot performance that culminates in 16 (!) non-stop pirouettes.",1485648000,3,5501,4.737722048066876
8457302,5,B00552JRVG,"This is a revolutionary DVD which will teach you how to pirouette. I have tried several other pirouette lessons on YouTube and DVD but none have helped me as much as the Finis Jhung did in this DVD.
Essential concepts are coined in impactful phrases that stick with the students: for example, Always stand in number 1, Go up because you push down, Go to the end of the plie. This deep understanding of movement in all its components is unique to Finis Jhung.
Addressed to the beginner studentof any agethis DVD contains 12 short lessons that will result in at least one pirouette, maybe even a doublebased on ability and experience.
What distinguishes Finiss approach to teaching the pirouette is that he takes you from apparently not-directly related movements and concepts to the actual turn. Finis asks you to internalize and practice with these essential concepts so that muscle memory, strength and balance are mastered first, before attempting to turn. Once there, the student will be equipped with all the knowledge and skills needed to pirouette successfully.
The lessons are short and have a clear focus and progress logically and beautifully in complexity. The student can practice each lesson in any order or connect the movements in separate lessons together as they practice. In Lessons 1 through 6 Finis describes the fundamental elements of the pirouette en dehors and Sachiko Kanaiwho demonstrates in several other Finis Jhung DVDsshows us how to do it correctly. Finis coaches her on how to perfect the movements in order to obtain that perfect balance. Sachiko applies the concepts and towards the end of the DVD, she does double pirouettes. Finis leaves us with a smile of satisfaction and the words: If we can go to the moon and back, we can all learn how to do a double pirouette.

I highly recommend this DVD to adult beginner students, aspiring dancers who need to get a clean pirouette and correct bad habits, or teachers in search of successful methods of teaching. Brilliant resource! Ileana Ray, Brooklyn, NY",1467331200,,2035,4.932944606413995
