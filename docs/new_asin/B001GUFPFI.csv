8307195,5,B001GUFPFI,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Not only from an 'occult'  but from a historical perspective as well.  It gives insight into the environment that resulted in  Hitler's rise to power.  Klaus Maria Brandauer is brilliant. He channels the characters in each one.  I also HIGHLY recommend the trilogy:  ""Mephisto"",  ""Colonel Redl"", and ""Mayerling""  ALL featuring  Brandauer",1436313600,,376,5.237288135593221
8307196,5,B001GUFPFI,"The third in director Istvn Szab's trilogy (Mephisto, Colonel Redl, Hanussen) from the 1980's is currently available on DVD for region one players only in this format, with subtitles in Spanish only.  I could not get access to Hanussen even on Netflix or various inter-library loan programs, so I took a chance and bought this DVD.  I found that if you have a passable reading knowledge of Spanish (far from fluent, say a year or two of high-school Spanish) you can still enjoy this film, especially if you also understand a bit of spoken German.  The picture quality is good-to-excellent, the  historical basis for the plot intriguing, and the in-joke cinematic references satisfyingly (or annoyingly) obscure.

The movie opens as German-speaking Austro-Hungarian soldiers on the Italian front during WWI ready an attack on a machine-gun nest hidden in a church.  Klaus Schneider, an infantryman, suffers a head wound and wakes up in a front-line hospital, where he befriends a Jewish psychiatrist named Bettelheim, and himself demonstrates an uncanny ability to control others almost hypnotically, calming a suicidal patient brandishing a hand grenade.  In addition, Schneider begins to exhibit a seemingly genuine ability to predict aspects of the future.  By the time the war ends, he's begun performing as a sort of seer, and when asked by an audience member if she will follow her family, currently on a ship bound for America, to the New World, he says none of them will reach America.  Next day news arrives the ship has sunk.  A spur of the moment answer to a broker who asks about the future price of cotton seems to be a joke, since Schneider, by now calling himself Hanussen, picks the number twenty-five because it was his grandmother's address.  Yet the price actually does plummet from over 100 to 25 within a week.  In a number of similar incidents Hanussen relies on charisma as much as seemingly supernatural talent and quick-wittedness to build enough of a reputation to enjoy a number of erotic encounters and to take his act to Berlin.

The remaining half of the film demonstrates how he gradually lets himself be drawn into political predictions, and public demonstrations of hypnotic control of others that eerily parallel his fellow-Austrian Hitler's rise to prominence and draw him into the Nazi orbit until events turn deadly as Hitler is about to assume power.  Especially noteworthy is the minor character Hanni Stahl, clearly modeled on Leni Riefenstahl.  The gradual descent of Hanussen to his final doom, the symbolic Lord's prayer and three cock-crows and final prophecy (""todos perecan"" as the subtitles have it), all make for utterly fascinating viewing.",1273017600,10,2688,5.077272727272727
