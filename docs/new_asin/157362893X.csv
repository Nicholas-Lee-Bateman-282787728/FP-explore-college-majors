7798382,4,157362893X,"This is a fascinating thriller that for some reason never got a theatrical release.  It went direct to video.  Ray Liotta is superb as the spaced-out hero who wakes up in the desert one day without a memory.  Ray gets fine help from actor Armin Mueller-Stahl.

Ray learns to his chagrin that trying to find out his true identity is a perilous occupation, indeed.  Rafts of bad guys are out do do him harm and he has no idea why.  He also finds out he has more than one identity.  It seems he was using a false ID when he checked into a little off-the-beaten-path beachside motel room.  That ID was the ID for a dead man.  Not a good sign for Ray.  Maybe a presage of things to come.

Sure, the hero with amnesia is all but a cliche nowadays, but ""Inferno"" unfolds in an intriguing, well-crafted, and well-paced manner.  The one drawback to the film is its enigmatic ending, which comes off as a weak point in the story.  The very last scene . . . I don't want to give away the ending and spoil the plot, but about that money . . . and Ray has that wry smile on his face when he's in the car and . . .

7798384,5,157362893X,"Ray Liotta the master of versatile acting is excellent in this film that he is practally in every scene of this film thus delveloping his character very well to the viewer. Liotta plays a career crimminal who wakes up in the desert with total amesia after falling out of a moving car down a steep and rough hill. He soon then encounters Vicky, a sexy waitress, who helps jack on his journey to finding out who he is, along the way trying to stay alive from his gang of murderous thieves after an ambush from the FBI follwing an armoured car heist. Preditcable storyline but delvered with great acting, especally form Armin Muller Stahl who seems to really enjoy playing the villian. Engaging storyline and evolving characters make INFERNO a great film to watch.",1172707200,3,761,4.686567164179104
7798385,4,157362893X,"We wake up in a desert. It feels hot, itchy and a bit dreamy, and who the hell am I anyway? From here our protagonist stumbles fortuitously into scrapes and close-calls with dangerous people who all want something from him now, or else - if only he could remember what.

Jack (no fixed last name) reflexively outwits his dangers and forestalls any consequences, while piecing together fragments of his former life - with an acute new perspective on it. It's a good hypothesis - what if a man could all of a sudden see his life objectively, and how would he react?

The film, shot in Mexico, has a great hot and sticky look (a la Traffic), and Armin Mueller-Stahl is a bonus as the oddly-named ""MacCaulay"" (sounding more East German than Scot.) Other players mainly support Jack's movement in the story, and it feels that way sometimes.",1101081600,2,835,4.635135135135135
7798386,3,157362893X,its predictale but the story and turns and twists are good. Liotta sparks the screen as the man who wakes up and doesnt know who he is(sorta like The Bourne Identity but much violent). good action and car chases. for die hard Liotta fans,1066694400,,237,4.409090909090909
7798387,3,157362893X,"For a low budget cable B movie, this was actually pretty decent.  Jack (Ray Liotta) wakes up in the desert with a bump on his head and total  amnesia.  Vicky (Gloria Reuben) gives him a ride and helps starts him on  his way to trying to find out who he is.  Of course, while he is trying to  piece it all together, some very nasty characters are trying to kill  him.
The story is intriguing and handled well.  It is somewhat  predictable, but there are a few interesting plot twists, a good deal of  violence, and plenty of car chases and action sequences.  The ending was  rather unfulfilling but not terrible.
The film was written and directed  by Harley Cokliss, whose prior experience includes mostly TV credits.  Cokliss' direction was straightforward and unremarkable, much like the  desert he was shooting.  The acting of the three leads was good,  particularly Liotta, who has some excellent performances on his resume  (Copland, Goodfellas).  He has a knack for making the bad guy seem  likeable, and that was the case again here.
Gloria Reuben also gave a  good performance as Vicky, though it was a pretty minor role.  Armin  Mueller-Stahl is always strong in supporting roles and he was particularly  good here as the heavy.
I rated this film a 6/10.  Good acting, engaging  story and adequate direction.  Add one or two points if you like guy  flicks.",962755200,5,1364,4.713675213675214
7798388,4,157362893X,"I like Ray Liotta. When we first saw him in Goodfellas, he was riveting. That sadistic laugh creeped under my skin. He was also excellent in Copland, No Escape and Phoenix. His latest flick starts off kind of  artsy-fartsy during the opening credits, but then immediately pulls you in  as we follow Ray as he tries to regain his memory. He has flashes of  violent images and other clues that  lead to the discovery of his recent  past. This is just a fun concept as we know no more or less than the main  character. By the end it kind of gets to be a predictable gun movie, but  the first 1/2 to 2/3 are great.",962236800,6,610,4.206896551724138
