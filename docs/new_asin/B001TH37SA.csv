3789799,1,B001TH37SA,"I have not bought this collection but just want to send a heads up because whilst reading reviews of a Marlon Brando film (One Eyed Jacks) many people wrote of the poor picture quality of DVD's from ""Madacy Home Video"" which this Streisand collection is from. So make sure you can return it if the DVD transfer is poor quality. If anyone who buys it would post a review from a technical point of view, not reviewing the films themselves, that would be helpful in deciding whether or not to purchase. Better product description would also be welcome, such as does it have any bonus material?",1245628800,6,590,4.5754716981132075
3789800,4,B001TH37SA,"I finally received the Streisand Collectible Tin today and I really like it.  It contains 4 of Ms. Streisand's films on DVD. The Prince of Tides, The Way We Were, The Mirror Has Two Faces, and Funny Girl.  The DVDS are exactly the same one can purchase from any retailer but it's the tin that I really wanted.  Plus I didn't own two of the films. Yet, I am inclined to think that any Streisand Fan would want this as a collectible. Glad I purchased it thanks Amazon!",1241395200,18,466,4.2727272727272725
3789801,1,B001TH37SA,"I, too, am confused about what is for sale here. Obviously the price is very low for 4 DVD's in a collectible tin. And then when Joseph asks the seller what he is selling, all he replies in the comments section is ""I think you should buy it"".???? A case of Buyer Beware obviously.",1241395200,4,280,4.203703703703703
3789802,1,B001TH37SA,"Supposedly this is the special collector's edition tin box of ""The Way We Were,"" ""Prince of Tides,"" ""The Mirror Has Two Faces,"" and ""Funny Girl.""",1240963200,3,145,4.84
3789803,1,B001TH37SA,"Amazon, could you please give a description of this product?  I would probably buy it, but haven't a clue what it is.  Thanks.",1240876800,12,126,4.434782608695652
3789814,4,B001TH37SA,"Perfect!!! I received my Barbra Streisand Collection very fast (within about three days).  It is obviously a boxed set but when you open the beautiful tin, Funny Girl is packaged separately... New; pefect condition. No issues with this product/seller :-)",1340582400,,254,5.35
3789815,1,B001TH37SA,"Someone commented that the price is low for 4 DVDs in a collector's tin. I don't know how much anyone values tins, but I would personally only value the box my movies come in at $25 at the most, unless it is made out of pure gold. Since the price point is $225, this leaves $50 per movie. I don't know if it is just the inadequate product description (as others have pointed out), and I am somehow missing the value here, but this product seems like a huge waste of money to me. I'd advise getting instead the collection that is exactly the same except without Funny Girl or the tin and save yourself $200. Then you can pick up a brand new copy of Funny Girl on its own for $10 AND you will know exactly what version of the movies you are getting.",1328745600,,747,4.123287671232877
3789816,5,B001TH37SA,"Beautiful movies, beautiful presentation.  I didn't expect too much because they are old movies, but they are good quality and the sound is fantastic.  I've got my order on time and well packed.",1323734400,2,194,4.848484848484849
3789817,5,B001TH37SA,"The dvd of Funny Girl was defective and the reseller was very prompt in replacing but this one is also defective.  Please advise. Can you forward to reseller so they can replace this one, but please check it first.
Thanks.",1314576000,,222,4.55

3789819,4,B001TH37SA,Got these as a gift for my partner. She loved the movies and the tin container for the movies. Great addition to any DVD collection,1302307200,5,131,4.28
3789820,5,B001TH37SA,"I love this box set and the collector tin it came in.  They chose some of Barbra's best movies for the collection.  ""Funny Girl""  my all time favorite is in there as well.  I highly recommend this tin set for anyone; a must for a Striesand fan.  I watch her movies daily and this is a great set and great collectors tin.

Grab it.  you will love it.

3789821,1,B001TH37SA,"I agree with the previous writers.  How can I buy this when I don't know what it contains?  A ""tin"" in and of itself doesn't mean a thing to me.  What's on the discs?  It is one disc or four?  Are there any extras?  What version are we getting?  Come on Amazon; come clean with this item.  What IS it?",1270252800,3,301,3.9
3789822,5,B001TH37SA,I was thrilled to receive the boxed set of Barbra Streisand movies.  They are some of my favourites and have added a new dimension to my DVD collection.  If you are a Streisand fan this is the set for you,1255046400,11,204,4.075
3789823,3,B001TH37SA,"Why almost NO information? How are we to buy something w/o pertinent info? I already have ""The way we were"" Special Edition which I LOVE. And I own ""The Prince of Tides"" which is bare bones w/o DD 5.1 or Bonus Features at all. But, I would buy this IF I could find out what is really being sold. I have only EVER seen ""The mirror has two faces"" w/Full Screen NO Anamorphic Widescreen and NO bonus Material at all, again. And ""Funny Girl"" I don't own. I would LOVE to buy this, but I will not IF the""Mirror"" is only Full Screen, and ""Prince"" is what I already own. I would be willing to buy ""The way we were"" and ""The Prince of tides""(hopefully w/bonus features THIS time) AGAIN, IF I could get ""Mirror"" w/at least Anamorphic Widescreen and hopefully SOME bonus features, also ""Funny Girl"" too. Why NO real info on this ""Collectors Release""??? Collectors want it all, I would settle for some of what I want, the more the better.",1253836800,5,927,4.364161849710983

All 4 movies are wonderful (including my 2 all time favorites in ""The Way We Were"" with an absolutely gorgeous Robert Redford and ""Funny Girl"" (Barbra was never better as evidenced by winning an Academy Award for this role) with Omar Sharrif who was also so handsome and The Prince of Tides with Nick Nolte and The Mirror Has Two Faces with Jeff Bridges.  You will not be disappointed in purchasing this collection and the tin box the 4 movies come in is really nice too.",1352937600,,557,4.5049504950495045
