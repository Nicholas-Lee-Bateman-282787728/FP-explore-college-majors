8563336,5,B00B6LB07E,These guys are the real deal bunch of working stiffs running around living the dream and chasing bucks and to the guys who complained about them driving around in cars this is unguided hunting on public land this is how most of us not blessed with private land get it done,1460332800,,272,4.352941176470588
8563337,5,B00B6LB07E,Just awesome what you see is what happened!,1459987200,,43,4.5
8563338,1,B00B6LB07E,"Not even worth  it on sale. Just driving around till they spot one then they try to chase it down.  Not hunting in my eyes.  A buck was wounded and they did pursue it but not once did I hear ""I feel bad for wounding that guy""  they just tracked it some then moved on to try to find another one to kill.  Its not funny what so ever.  Lastly I learned nothing save your money guys.",1444953600,,379,3.857142857142857
8563339,5,B00B6LB07E,"These guys hunt hard and make it seem like this is something we can all do, which makes it relatable. They shoot mature bucks, Laugh and have a good time, and miss a few deer here and there too. It's 100% real and 100% real entertaining.",1436054400,2,237,4.173913043478261
8563340,5,B00B6LB07E,These guys rock! I love the way these are produced! I'm buying them all!,1424822400,3,72,4.214285714285714
8563341,1,B00B6LB07E,"What a waste. These guys drive around in cars, spot deer , then chase after them. The end result is many deer either missed , or worse off.......wounded. Totally not an ethical video at all. No wonder why PETA has an issue with us hunters. This is a poor example of hunting, and a waste of money. So glad I purchased this , since now I gave them more money to carry on....(sarcasm ).....",1423094400,,387,4.243243243243243
