8297588,5,B001ECDVJK,"The Episode 1 is a bit of a misnomer, as it is simply the 1st tape released on VHS. (Ira states at the beginning of the tape ""Welcome again"",) The contents from two shows are in a different order than that listed on the box: dinosaurs, bullet proof glass and vests, heartburn, Newton's Lemons (remote baby rocker, auto elevator), killer whales, comets, perpetual motion machines, warts, Newton's Lemons (strato gyroplane, failed American V-2 test flight), sharks.  This is the only tape that the end credits for both shows are run in their entirety, one right after the other. Copyright on tape is 1985, and running time is 57 minutes.",1384128000,,635,4.825688073394495
