8096801,4,B000CC1TZG,"This is an R rated version.  Anyone whose seen the full version will notice the difference.  Unlike most edited versions of hot movies, this one still has quality love scenes.  A few of the scenes are cut down to almost nothing, but not most.  There are still wonderfully revealing, passionate, and sensual scenes.

The plot is enough to make the characters alive, and enjoyable.  The numerous love triangles are entertaining.  Mick and Kate make a great couple, and their connections to the others characters are fun.

It's great to see this cast again.  They're quite sensual.",1423872000,,578,4.9375
8096802,3,B000CC1TZG,Would have been better had I opted for the unrated version as I recollect seeing this movie in a much more steamier avatar,1404086400,,122,4.3478260869565215

8096806,1,B000CC1TZG,"I saw this movie on Showtime, which was longer than the DVD. The sex scenes on T.V. were longer and far better than what was on video. Susan Featherly is one of the hottest ladies in the soft core genre. Her last love scene, when taking it from behind and the moans she makes are very arousing. Like most of my searches for these types of movies, sometimes you have to track down VHS,or even a region 2 DVD. Then you must also get an all region/or region 2 player. If the XXX industry is said to be thriving, the producers of the softcore genre could increase the business success by releasing the unrated cuts of these films.",1236038400,14,626,4.313559322033898
