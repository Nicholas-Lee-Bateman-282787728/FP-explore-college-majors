I also want to say that I admire that love she clearly has for her husband Larry, her children and her friends - and she's funny as hell too!  I give the show 5 stars but the DVD doesn't play in normal Region 1 DVD players so I had to view it on my computer so it wasn't so user friendly.  Season 1 and 4 have been released on DVD and played perfectly - so I don't know why the Fan Favorites didn't.  I hope they release the rest of her show on DVD - it's great!",1503446400,,615,3.8188976377952755

She can't get enough of this program. For me the show is meh. She was excited to get this as a gift and in the end that all that matters. If you are or someone you know is a fan of ""Long Island Medium"" then this box set from the first season should be a must to get.",1502755200,,407,3.6363636363636362
