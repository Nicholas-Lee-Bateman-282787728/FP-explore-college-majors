7868516,3,6304326300,"THE OX explores the same themes found in CRIME AND PUNISHMENT,LES MISERABLES ,BABETTE'S FEAST and DECEMBER'S BRIDE-is anybody totally guiltless? Though the film is quite plodding just as an ox would be,one is left with the universal message that everyone is capable of doing anything to survive. In a harsh Lutheran Calvinistic Sweden of the Late 1800's the themes of ""does the punishment fit the crime"" and ""forgive as you have been forgiven"" are set forth quite stoically in this true story of a man,his wife,a Pastor,and the entire parish who are confronted with the biblical admonition'""Let the one who is without sin cast the first stone."" The movie is cold and bleak in it's setting and filming. Only colours of hope appear when forgiveness is finally granted and received. The score of Edvard Grieg is used to great effect in backing the story. This is not a film for pleasurable viewing. It is harsh and is made to make one think about one's actions and attitudes towards themselves and others.",1168300800,,1002,4.8654970760233915
7868517,5,6304326300,"If you care nothing for matters of criminal justice, disregard the title and the rather specific concern of this review, and just rent this movie and enjoy. It is a rare kind of film that deserves attention for its narrative technique of quiet captivation and its stunning characterization of human hope amidst disappointment and failure. But I will leave that analysis to other reviewers more capable.
In a moment of desperation, a peasant (Helge) steals from his employer (slaughtering an ox with a sledgehammer) to feed his starving child and wife, who for her part is terrified by the brutal act. Director Sven Nykvist brilliantly captures an immediate alienation of husband and wife, which is followed by both of their alienation from a fragile village, suffering from famine and emigration. Helge finally finds himself driven to the cow paths in the woods, avoiding human society.
How is such alienation, necessarily caused by a sinful (or criminal, depending on which way you look at it) act, resolved? Nykvist explores two distinct possibilities: the state system on one hand and an ancient code of reconciliation on the other. You will profit greatly from meditating on this film. If only US judges and legislators would!",1088121600,7,1230,5.094059405940594
7868518,5,6304326300,"Set in rural Sweden in the late 1800's, ""The Ox"" (original Swedish title ""Oxen"") is an insightful period film starring Stellan Sk&auml;rsgard, Liv Ullman, and Max Von Sydow, and is directed by Sven  Nykvist.
The main character (Sk&auml;rsgard) is driven by hunger to kill and  butcher the land-owner's ox for his family, and must then deal with the  consequences of his wrong-doing.  For insight into the Swedish immigration  into the U.S., this movie makes a wonderful chronological predecessor to  the film ""The Emmigrants"", starring Max von Sydow, which became  the basis for the story ""Unto a New Land"", which was adapted to  the U.S. TV series ""Little House on the Prairie"".  In Swedish  with English subtitles.",935539200,26,716,5.094827586206897
