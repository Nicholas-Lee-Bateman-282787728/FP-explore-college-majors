I randomly picked this one and I'm glad I did. This documentary was very well made and very well written. Very enjoyable to watch so TRUST ME you won't regret getting this!

2612558,5,B000GH3CQG,I loved this DVD!  I'm interested in Marie Antoinette anyway but anyone who appreciates history would find this very entertaining and informative. I consider this a 'must have' for my home video collection.,1204416000,5,206,5.242424242424242
2612559,5,B000GH3CQG,"I never really given much thought to Marie Antoinette. All I knew about the former queen of France was that she was beheaded after found guilty of various crimes ranging from corruption to treason. After I saw the lifeless Sophia Coppola film ""Marie Antoinette"", my curiousity about the former queen was piqued. This PBS documentary was aired not too long ago but I missed seeing most of it. I was fortunate to find a copy to rent through the web based rental service I use.

I found ""Marie Antoinette"" the documentary far more engaging. The life of Marie Antoinette is indeed fascinating. She almost reminds me of Paris Hilton of her day with her lack of intellectual curiousity and love of frivolous spending and other means of pleasure. It is hard not to see the comparison between the deceased queen of France and the current queen of overexposure.

In the PBS documentary, the filmmaker goes further in depth of Marie Antoinette's life after she and Louis tries to leave Paris, France and eventually their gruesome fate at the hands of the guillotine. I would have liked to have heard more about Marie's life prior to her marriage to Louis (like it was covered in thorough detail in Antoina Fraser's book). Blair Brown does a superb job as narrator. I found this documentary extremely well produced and thought out. There are other documentaries on Marie Antoinette but I only imagine that they would be not as good as PBS's two hour documentary on Marie Antoinette. I had fun learning about Marie Antoinette which led me to check out more books and documentaries about the former queen of France.",1163721600,47,1602,4.7797833935018055

2612582,5,B000GH3CQG,"This film uses a number of experts and original art to tell the story of the life of Marie Antoinette. As always PBS has gone that extra trillionth mile and dug so deeply into their research, I can guarantee no matter who you are, you will learn something new about the last queen of France.

2612611,3,B000GH3CQG,"I personally enjoyed watching this documentary. I was a little disappointed, however, in the graphic content specifically Marie and Louis' problems in the bedroom. They leave no doubt as to exactly what the problems were. I was hoping to be able to show this in parts to my high school classes as we study our way through the French Revolution. This documentary simply isn't appropriate for a 9th or 10th  audience. It's interesting for adults, but not appropriate for kids or teens.",1416873600,,483,4.890243902439025

2612615,5,B000GH3CQG,"A great historical documentary on the life of Marie Antoinette, covering her entire life from beginning to end, with many details on her marriage to Louis XVI and her life and death during the French Revolution.  She is portrayed as a haughty queen who eventually reforms and dies a very tragic death. It is a combination of drama and narration, so be prepared for that.  I consider it a well done PBS production.",1407196800,3,413,4.6438356164383565
2612616,5,B000GH3CQG,"The item arrived promptly and was packaged well.  Good movie about Marie Antoinette, a queen out of touch with her subjects.  I know understand why the monarcy was guillotined in France.",1400976000,,186,4.967741935483871
2612617,4,B000GH3CQG,"This film has a very rich texture with details of the opulence of French aristocracy: it looks like it was filmed inside the palace of Versailles and certainly within its gardens. Doesn't matter if it was or wasn't because it has the same feel as the actual palace.
It helps to understand the blissful ignorance of the monarchy and their frozen shock when they were taken prisoners by the mobs.
They were actually insulated from reality by the sheer upholstery of their palace.
I also appreciated the narrative of the film which made the point that Marie Antoinette was by no means incapable of analytical thought. But not until everything she was and everything she loved was stripped from her did she acquire a political insight and a calm fortitude which remained with her despite all attempts of the judges to unbalance her reason. She was no one's puppet at her trial or at her execution. She did possess her own courage and nobility of character. Quite a thoughtful film. (Missing young America's reaction to their benefactors' deaths by revolution. Too much irony to ignore.)",1379980800,6,1082,4.854054054054054
2612618,5,B000GH3CQG,"Superb Documentary. Informatives haved lied to stain her honor, but she is one of the bravest and noblest women we have ever know.

There will never be another person like her for a long long time. May her rest in peace.",1371772800,2,379,4.352112676056338

2612633,4,B000GH3CQG,"We always look @ PBS documentary on Television.  This DVD gave a excellent history account of the life of Marie Antoinette.
It was sad that she did not care about what was going on outside of herself.  She of course was very young and did not have a clue of what happens outside of her world. she was very, very selfish.

2612637,4,B000GH3CQG,"After listening to Antonia Fraser's excellent and exhaustive biography of Marie Antoinette on audiobook (MARIE ANTOINETTE: THE JOURNEY), I immediately hopped onto Netflix in search of a related documentary or two.  The only one to catch my eye was David Grubin's MARIE ANTOINETTE: A FILM. Try as I might, I can't help but critique Grubin's film in relation to Fraser's biography.

Grubin's MARIE ANTOINETTE clocks in at about two hours, compared to the 20+ hour narration of Fraser's MARIE ANTOINETTE. While it might seem unfair to compare the two for this reason alone, they do share a similar story arc and cover much the same ground. In fact, Grubin includes  snippets of interviews with several French historians in MARIE ANTOINETTE, one of whom is Antonia Fraser herself!

Given the time limitation, Grubin does a decent enough job of detailing the life and death of Marie Antoinette, starting with her childhood in Vienna, Austria, and ending with her death at the hands of ""revolutionaries"" in Paris, France. Even so, Grubin barely scratches the surface; for example, though he attempts to examine Marie Antoinette's psychological, social and intellectual development, the audience is only beginning to get a feel for Marie Antoinette the person by film's end. Additionally, Grubin raises a few controversial points - such as Marie Antoinette's relationship with Count Ferson - which is unfortunate, because he's unable to examine points of contention on anything but a superficial level. For example, Fraser dealt with historical controversies by returning to contemporary accounts of the events (diaries, letters, etc.), detailing various modern views on the issue, and then concluding with her own reasoned interpretation of the evidence. Grubin simply doesn't have enough time to do the same.

On the plus side, Grubin's film boasts one momentous advantage over Fraser's (audio)book - visual aids! Grubin interlaces interviews and narration with video and stills for stunning visual effects. MARIE ANTOINETTE: A FILM highlights a number of contemporary images, including portraits of Marie Antoinette and her friends and family, as well as scores of pages from then-scandalous pamphlets and propaganda - much of which contains nudity and sketches of a sexual nature (thankfully, none is censored). Grubin juxtaposes modern video of historical places - Versailles, Le Petit Trianon, Vienna - with these historical images, thus allowing the audience access to the places significant to Madame Antoine's child- and adulthood.

Additionally, I thought that Grubin's recounting of the French Revolution was more linear and easier to follow than was Fraser's. Fraser interspersed her accounts of the revolutionary political climate in France with its effects on Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI, while Grubin offered a lean - but informative - summary towards the end of his film.

All in all, I enjoyed MARIE ANTOINETTE: A FILM, but coming off of MARIE ANTOINETTE: THE JOURNEY, felt as though I'd already heard much of Grubin's story. Newbies will probably find MARIE ANTOINETTE: A FILM a nice introduction to the topic, while history buffs might like the film's visuals. All in all, a keeper.",1245110400,25,3202,5.341269841269841
2612638,5,B000GH3CQG,"I first saw this on TV and was completely engaged.  I just got this DVD today and very happy to own it.  Marie Antoinette's early life was completely in a bubble.  Yes she reminds us of celebrities like Paris Hilton but did she deserve to die?!!  Of course, not!. She was completely ignorant of anything outside of her royal confines.  In fairness to her, I think the partial cause of this tragedy was Louis XVI, who was an inept person let alone a King! If he was half as much of what a King should be, he would've dealt with much of the country's financial issues rather than Marie herself.  He also could've made her change her frivolous ways and become more responsible to her subjects.  It was just a mess.  People blame her solely but half of it if not much of it was not her fault.  She was in a wrong time with the wrong man.  Granted she was a horrible queen but part of the reason which led to her execution was due to those pamphlet lies!  I agree with the Englishman historian that if only she and the king could agree on a constitutional monarchy, which would have saved the royal family and prevented an uprising.  It's just too bad.  Very tragic indeed!  I will go to Petit Trianon to see it.  Been to Versaille but not her Petit Trianon.  Vive la Marie!",1235779200,6,1269,4.291139240506329
2612639,4,B000GH3CQG,"Forever famous as the last French queen, and who lost her head, literally, to the French Revolution, I thought I knew quite a bit about Marie Antoinette.  After watching this film by David Grubin, I realized I had much to learn.  The film is organized in what can be called the ""standard"" historical film format, containing current on location shots of pertinent locales; pictures of paintings/engravings to give you a sense of what the people looked like at that time; actors portraying main characters in snippets of live action; interviews with knowledgeable historians; and a narrator to knit it all together.  This film format works, and since it is familiar, one can concentrate on the content.

Hour one is called ""The marriage bed"" and recounts the years when a very young Marie Antoinette became the wife of then prince Louis XVI.  Most of us who study history know that the couple did not consummate their marriage for several years, and the film takes time to thoroughly examine this issue, since sex amongst royals, who had to create an heir, was an open topic of the court.  Marie Antoinette's rich lifestyle and large spending habits are outlined in this hour, as well as how much Marie Antoinette's mother (the Empress of Austria) was involved in her daily life at the French court.  But what you really see is just how much Marie Antoinette (and Louis XVI) was totally out of touch with the everyday lives of the French citizenry, and why the revolution did take them by surprise.

Hour two is called ""The most hated woman in France"" and recounts the beginnings of the French Revolution, and how it lead to the end of the absolute monarchy in France at the time.  During this time, Marie Antoinette finally understood how her frivolous lifestyle had alienated her from her subjects.  The film shows many (in my view, too many) examples of what we now call political cartoons of the day, depicting the supposed sexual debauchery of Marie Antoinette.  Of course, these cartoons, along with the large national debt France has rung up, added fuel to an already burning fire of discontent in France, and much of the blame was laid at the feet of Marie Antoinette.  We all know the outcome -- Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette both meet their deaths under the blade of the guillotine.

When the film ended, I was left torn between feeling sorry for Marie Antoinette, who was just a young girl when she was thrust into the crazy stage of the French court and knew no other lifestyle but one of luxury; and feeling sorry for the French people that their king and queen were so out of touch that only revolution would change things.  Marie Antoinette was a tragic figure, much of her own doing, and continues to be an interesting character to study. This film does an excellent job providing fuel to anyone who is interested in learning more about Marie Antoinette.",1214956800,11,2869,4.734939759036145
