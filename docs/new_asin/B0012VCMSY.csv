8247904,2,B0012VCMSY,"I am a big Zorro fan, and collect Zorro movies when I find them. This is a very old TV run production with poor acting. Pretty typical of what was produced in 50's. Oh well, you win some, you lose some.",1373587200,,202,3.951219512195122
8247905,4,B0012VCMSY,"If you love Zorro, you will love this.

I'm a Zorro Fanatic, so I almost always love whatever Zorro I can watch, so this collection was great.",1328572800,,142,4.2592592592592595
8247906,5,B0012VCMSY,"I have been watching all 3 Zorro serials from Republic studios on this set. The  are a blast. They remind me of how fun movies used to be. The 3 films are just a joy to watch and the stunts are amazing.
While watching you have to realize that the special effects are all mechanical with no money they could not afford any form of expensive special effects. That is why Republic hired some of the best stunt people in Hollywood. The fist fights and shoot outs are remarkable.
The films are all family friendly. I and my grandchildren have a blast watching these film I highly recommend this set and they are at a great price.",1326672000,,624,4.333333333333333
8247907,4,B0012VCMSY,Can't beat the price for these Zorro (or Zorro inspired) serials even if the packaging could be much better.  Picture quality not that bad but don't expect it to be remastered or improved like in more expensive DVD's.  Also BOLD CABALLERO is in black and white and not in Magnacolor like it was originally shown back in 1936.  It's best to watch two episodes of each serial (like TCM shows serials on Saturday afternoon) at a time instead of trying to watch the whole thing in one sitting.  Again very watchable and enjoyable for serial fans.,1322179200,,542,4.614583333333333
8247908,1,B0012VCMSY,"Don't let the picture on the cover fool you. This is NOT Zorro! This is the Lone Ranger dressed in black with a goofy mask, and with two six guns and a whip. He doesn't even have a sword!!! I'm sorry, this baloney with cowboys riding around on horses with six shooters like the old west, and other people driving around in cars dressed in 1930's and 40's suits and clothing just doesn't do it for me. Never has. And this crock about how he is the real Zorros' great grandson. Phooey! Only one star because I can't give it minus stars. TOTAL JUNK!! I waited with great excitement for this thing too! And shame on who ever put that picture on the cover. And even more shame on who ever let them do it! Very misleading. Scumbags!!!",1276300800,6,728,4.282608695652174
8247909,5,B0012VCMSY,"Robert Livingston's ""The Bold Caballero"" is worth the ""Price of Admission"" alone!!!  If you enjoy Warner Oland's dark and dangerous Charlie Chan to the light hearted Sidney Toler - - - and - - - if you enjoy Gilbert Roland's Cisco Kid to Duncan Renaldo - you will most probably enjoy Robert Livingston's Zorro.  Whereas Douglas Fairbanks takes a swashbuckling approach - and - Tyrone Power a ""foppish"" approach - Livingston is dangerous.  Also it would be a vast understatement foe me to say that Heather Angle - as the leading lady - is second to none - as proven with her one-on-one scene with Sig Ruman.  I could practically feel my ""skin crackle"" myself!  As a general comment to the feature length films in this package - they all are of standard fare and recommended only for fans of the Republic Style Westerns.  Although enjoyable - they are typical cliff-hangers.  For instance I counted over one-hundred-twenty gun shots being fired from six pistols during the opening chase scene of Linda Stirling's: Zorro's Black Whip.  Plus it was even more astounding to witness a resolute George Lewis endure at least one concussion per chapter and fare none-for-the-worse-for-wear.  Again - I highly recommend for western serial buffs.  One last comment.  The Bold Caballero was originally filmed in both a red and green tint version - with only the green tint version surviving.  If any film is a candidate for digital restoration and colorization - this is that film.  I sure hope that Legend films sets its sights on this one.",1243555200,6,1529,4.857142857142857
8247910,4,B0012VCMSY,"The fictional character Zorro (Spanish for 'fox') first appeared in ""The Curse of Capistrano,"" a five-part 1919 magazine series. Don Diego de la Vega (aka Zorro) was a nobleman and master swordsman who lived in Spanish and Mexican-era California. With his black cape and mask, fearless Zorro defended the people from various oppressors and outlaws, making his enemies look ridiculous in the process.

Zorro has a long cinematic history. ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1920) was the first-ever UNITED ARTISTS release. During the 1930s and '40s, Zorro was featured in both movies and serials. In 1949, TV's ""Lone Ranger"" (Clayton Moore) portrayed the Hispanic masked man in ""Ghost of Zorro."" DISNEY studios revived Zorro for television in the 1950s-- there was a series that was later shown episodically on the Mickey Mouse Club program. In 1981, George Hamilton played it campy in ""Zorro - The Gay Blade,""  starring as both Don Diego and his fey brother, Bunny Wigglesworth. Late in the '90s, Antonio Banderas took up the tradition and Zorro's sword, mask and cape in two popular films.

MCE's ZORRO - The MASKED AVENGER consists of three 12-chapter movie serials and an hour-length film. This 1936 feature, ""The Bold Caballero,"" was originally released in luscious Magnacolor. It is unfortunately presented here in b&w.
