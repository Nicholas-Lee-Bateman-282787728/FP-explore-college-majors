8092982,4,B000BUUXG0,"I waited a long time for the second half of the Redwall saga to become available. I was not disappointed. It completes the saga nicely. I would rate the movie higher if the two Redwall movies were a smoothly flowing stream rather than made up of a series of twenty minute vignettes. But after reading Brian Jacques' book years ago, I hoped someone would do it as an animated movie. Until someone does, this will do.",1406419200,,415,4.473684210526316
8092983,5,B000BUUXG0,"This is such a wonderful series.  I have read all or the books and have seen all of the shows on tv.  I bought this cheap at a store ($7.50)  I watched it and I was brought to tears.  It reminded me about all the good times I had when I was younger.  The DVD is over all very good.  I just wish that they had some extras and/or had the parts where Brian Jaques talks about the show, but it was still good.  I just want to know when the #rd season is coming out (Martin the Warrior)in english.  I mean I like japanese but I need subtitles to understand it.",1155081600,2,555,3.892857142857143
