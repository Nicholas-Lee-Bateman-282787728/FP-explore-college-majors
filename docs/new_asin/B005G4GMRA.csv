Although it does have a home movie quality, it is professionally shot with a high definition camera.  Also included is a vintage 3D video from 1999.  Its amazing how much we have progressed since then!",1438646400,,376,4.651515151515151

A friend saw this for $5--- somewhere that starts
with an ""e"" ---and knew I had a 55"" 3D TV. He spent
the bucks, and had it sent to my German residence.
He came over to my house, and noticed that I am us-
ing the disc --- outside --- hanging from a small tree...
it keeps deer from eating buds.
Other than t=h=a=t feature, this is a TOTALLY lame
waste of plastic and paper. Speaking of PAPER, I
gave my friend his money back along with THANKS
and an APOLOGY!

BE warned! Save YOUR money!",1388707200,,538,4.123809523809523
8471124,1,B005G4GMRA,"You might be thinking, as I did, that this would at least be an interesting 3-d demo to show folks.  You'd be wrong.

The 3d looks weird (based on other reviews this is probably due to the parallax, but i'm not an expert).  The content is totally lame, just walking around an amusement park and some other equally uninspiring thing.

Buy some other 3d movie as your demonstration.",1339891200,,380,4.544117647058823
8471125,1,B005G4GMRA,"This has to be the Worst 3D movie ever  made, I would give it 0 stars, this movie is so bad they ought to give it awaw for free, or send it to your worst enemy.",1330214400,2,160,3.4444444444444446
8471126,1,B005G4GMRA,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

EXCESS PARALLAX makes watching these shorts a very unpleasant experience. Only a handful of the more static scenes could be considered good 3D. Many people may feel eye strain or get headaches from watching this disc.

***  AVOID UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE 3D GONE WRONG !!!  ***

MY 3D RATING = POOR  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

8471127,3,B005G4GMRA,"A low budget 3D movie at around $10 that has some interesting 3D scenes for kids and adults of 79 min total length. Some great shots of animals & kids in Zoo Veszpren & interesting rides for kids in Familypark Austria. The Sailing on Balaton was somewhat interesting but not as captivating as the zoo animals & kids rides. A separate bonus feature of under water diving off California coast in 1999 was of older poor quality 3D, almost unwatchable.
Unfortunately the movie segments looked like hand held home movies much of the time with some jerky camera motion & some out of focus times. The movie needed more professionsl camera use and editing out of distracting jerky & out of focus segments. But still worth watching for a low budget 3D movie mainly for kids & some adults.",1321660800,4,779,4.611510791366906
8471128,2,B005G4GMRA,"bought this cuz it was under $10 and in 3D. little or no entertainment value. this could have been better if it at least had any good commentary (there was none) just a lame digitized ""disco"" sound track.
the underwater footage from monterey bay is narrow screen 3D rendering circa. 1999 (low def.) almost unwatchable due to bad paralax.
i still give it 2 stars just as an example of 3D.
without any real audio this is just a ""good home movie"" shot in 3D.

save your money!",1319500800,8,473,4.375
