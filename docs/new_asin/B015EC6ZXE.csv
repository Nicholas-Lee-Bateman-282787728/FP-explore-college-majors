7433620,4,B015EC6ZXE,"This road movie is definitely in line with what Melvins fans have come to expect from Buzz & Dale.

The band (Melvins lite format) visits all 50 states plus DC, and the resulting 51-minutes are divided into one minute per state, a montage of band in-jokes and relentless badgering of one another. Each minute also includes some nifty artwork introducing each state and usually includes a brief live clip of the band on stage. Trevor appears to be dressed like Angus for most of the gigs. The mighty Warlock Pinchers got a shout out during the Colorado segment. The special effects are a nice bonus.

As a fan, this was fun to watch. If you are not already a fan, this is not a great place to start.",1451260800,,698,4.4453125

7433622,5,B015EC6ZXE,Everything one would expect from the Melvins. This it not a live show. So don't look for it. Just sit back and enjoy the mayhem that is the Melvins.,1448668800,,148,4.137931034482759
7433623,5,B015EC6ZXE,"If you love the Melvins you will love this. It is basic and to the point. No complete songs, just a fast-paced montage with more off-stage footage than on. Whimsical, witty, heavy and well-edited.

If you are looking for a concert performance film this is not that, but if you are looking for the Melvins trademark attitude presented in semi-candid video form, here you go. You've got a bunch of guys goofing off, raising some subtle curious juxtapositions about American culture out along the road. And this is definitely a ""road movie"".

The Melvins are groundbreaking, extremely devoted to their craft, and this movie is relatively modest about those things. They are a perfect model for how a professional band should exist.

Again, if you love the Melvins you will love this.",1448582400,6,780,4.893939393939394

8733290,3,B015EC6ZXE,"Some of the other quotes are very accurate.. a ""Melvins selfie"" seems to be the best description. Melvins goofing off.. bad jokes. very little music.. maybe a 4-8 bars of any given song at any time. Mention of a world record is all over the place but no actual footage or award is mentioned. I would have liked to see it. Its a interesting glimpse of a whirlwind tour in what feels like 2 minute snippets. Good for a watch, then easily forgettable. Suggested for die hard Melvins fans... and even they might be wary.",1455062400,3,516,4.442105263157894
8733291,3,B015EC6ZXE,"This is a nice document of the Melvins ""51 States in 51 Days"" tour.  I was at the Boston show, and I am an avid Melvins fan.  The Melvins super fan is one of those rare type of music fan who seeks out every out-of-print album, bootleg, etc., that they can get their hands on.  Melvins offer a wealth of material for their fans to enjoy.  That said, I found this DVD was a little lacking.  For a fan of the band's music, it's a little disappointing that we never get more than 30 seconds of the band on stage, or of any of their music at all.  It's basically 51 little snippets of ""Now were in stats X. [clip of club], [clip of in/out of context interview], [weird video effect], [driving]""...repeat.  There are no extras, nor extended performances or interviews.  This might only be good for the ultra completest, and probably not of much interest to anyone else.  (more like two stars, but my heart won't let me give the Melvins less than three)",1454889600,11,946,4.36
