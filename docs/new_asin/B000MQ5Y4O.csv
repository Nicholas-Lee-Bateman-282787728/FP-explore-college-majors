If I knew there was going to be a ""mega"" roast set, I could have saved myself TIME,
and MONEY.
Oh well!",1388102400,,186,3.675
8170721,3,B000MQ5Y4O,"I ordered the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast of Don Rickles and Angie Dickinson. I ordered a used copy not realizing it was a VHS Tape and not a DVD.

The tape is in good condition. Sound and picture quality was good. Some of the guests during Don Rickles roast I question why they were invited. One was some astonaut and the others were minor comediannes I never heard of. At one point a man (Casey Kassem : original voice of Shaggy on Scooby Doo) comes out imitating Adolph Hitler. Most of what he says is so garbled its in audible. The laugh track also drowns him out. I would of liked to have seen a few more famous faces like Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr. Thesse guys have a history of working with Rickles. At the end when Rickles gets up to thank and then cut down everyone, the camera never pans over to Phyllis Diller or Carol Channing. Carol isn't even mentioned in Rickles monolog.

Some of the other celebrities featured were Telly Savalas, Jack Klugman, Rich Little, Joey Bishop, Charlie Callas and Lorne Greene.

The highlights of the Rickles roast was Foster Brooks, Nipsey Russell and Rowan & Martin perfomance. I forgot how everyone smoked while on stage.

The editing on the Angie Dickinson roast was choppy. This segment appears to be heavily editied down. Eve Arden, Cathy Rigby and another actress never made it up to the podium to speak. It seemed everytime a celebrity ended their set, there was a chop and then Dean was back at the podium. It didn't seem to flow right.

The highlights of the Angie Dickinson roast was Ruth Buzzi, Jimmy Walker, Foster Brooks and Red Buttons (who Never Got A Dinner!). Some of the other celebrities included are Scatman Cruthers, La Wanda Paige, Orson Wells, Charlie Callas, Cindy Williamns, Earl Holliman and Jimmmy Stewart.

The tape was 2 hours and ten minutes long.

The shows, as I remember had a giant round sign behind the podium reading Man (or Woman) Of The Hour. The sign on the Rickles roast said Man Of The Week. Maybe this wasn't the usual Dean Martin Roasts? I don't know.......

I'd be skeptical about buying any of the DVD's that are in the $35.00 price range. After my aunt & uncle passed away in 2005 they had 3 tapes in their collection featuring Bob Hope, Lucy and Dean as roasties. Now these tapes were full of all the famous stars and jokes that almost made you fall off your seat laughing.

The Don Rickles / Angie Dickinson roast  had its funny moments, but its wasn't as funny as others.

I've read a few books on Dean Martin and it seemed these roasts were filmed in pieces. The stars segments were filmed without Dean even present. I think Dean's parts were filmed with out the stars present. Most of the roasts used stock footage throughout the run of the Celebrity Roasts. I don't even think they were actually filmed at the MGM Grand Hotel.",1232755200,3,2846,4.5390625
