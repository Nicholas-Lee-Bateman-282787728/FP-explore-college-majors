8015471,5,B0001OGVRQ,"We laughed so hard watching these. It's great, family-friendly entertainment. There are a couple of silent episodes with only music. The kids were a little leery at first, but soon you forgot that there were no words and were laughing right along.",1354924800,,247,4.904761904761905
8015472,4,B0001OGVRQ,"I fine collection of classic Our Gang shorts. The transfers are pretty clean. The audio is quite good. Many classic episodes. For the price this is an easy recommend for any fan.

Speaking of price...

HEY AMAZON! I paid you $14 for this set. When I opened your box there was the set, sealed in plastic with a big $10 sticker on the box.

Thanks a lot for that lovely reminder that I overpaid. And me a customer for 10 years now... Sheesh.",1195948800,7,439,4.265060240963855
