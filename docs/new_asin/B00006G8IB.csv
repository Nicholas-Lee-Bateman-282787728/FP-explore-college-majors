1755196,4,B00006G8IB,"Once again, Shakespeare is afforded a cinematic, contemporary rendering in ""Scotland, Pa.,"" written for the screen and directed by Billy Morrissette, an updated version of the tragedy, ""Macbeth,"" which here becomes a black comedy of tragic proportions.  Morrissette jumps on the bandwagon that began in 1996 with Baz Luhrmann's ""William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet,"" which was followed by further spins on the bard's plays, including Julie Taymor's energetic and imaginative ""Titus"" in `99 and Michael Almereyda's dreadful and dreary ""Hamlet"" in 2000.  Morrissette's offering-- which differs from the others in that it does not retain the Shakespearian language and verse-- falls somewhat beneath Luhrmann and Taymor's films, but far above Almereyda's dismal effort, which was a tragedy in ways that transcended the story.  Be advised, this one is a ""black comedy"" in every sense of the definition, and actually comes in on the absolute ""darkest"" end of the spectrum.  There's no getting around it, ""Macbeth"" is a depressing story to begin with, and this version decidedly captures the spirit of the play that inspired it.
This story begins with a look at businessman Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn), who after selling his successful donut shops (""Duncan"" Donuts, anyone?) has established a hamburger stand, which due in no small part to the innovative ideas of employee Joe McBeth (James LeGros) and the support of Joe's wife, Pat McBeth (Maura Tierney)-- also an employee of Duncan's-- has become a successful enterprise, as well as a harbinger of a chain of fairly well-known burger stands that start with ""M"" and today enjoy the lion's share of the fast-food market.  And now Norm has come up with his best idea yet, one that's going to take the simple burger stand into the future and put Duncan's at the top of the heap.
It's a grand scheme alright, and Norm graciously shares his intentions with his best employees, Joe and Pat.  But there's a rub; the idea was originally Joe's, and Norm's taking the credit does not sit too well with the McBeth's, who envision a hamburger joint of their own, ""McBeth's,"" sitting beneath the huge arches formed by the big red ""M"" of the sign that stands above the entrance to the restaurant.  And the whole business goes south very quickly, as ""Norm's"" idea leads a seething Joe and Pat down a path that must necessarily end in murder and mayhem if their plan is, in fact, acted upon.  And is it?  For the answer to that, one must look no further than the source material, and keep in mind the term, ""tragedy.""
Billy Morrissette's is an interesting and fairly imaginative presentation, but in staying true to the essence of the play it takes you, finally, to a very dark place.  And even though he supplies a rather amusing ending infused with shrouded irony, be advised, this one's a downer; and it may seem something of a contradiction in terms, but it's going to make you laugh in spite of yourself.  And you'll hate yourself in the morning because of it.
Still, there's no denying that this is a clever, if just short of inspired, piece of filmmaking.  The single drawback is the casting of LeGros in the lead role; he does a decent job, even acceptable by most standards, but he lacks the screen presence and charisma to really sell it.  The part of Joe called for someone like Thomas Jay Ryan, who was so riveting in Hal Hartley's ""Henry Fool"" in 1998, a film which coincidentally featured another actor who could've pulled this part off successfully, and who happens to have a small, but pivotal role in this film, Kevin Corrigan.
Corrigan, a terrific character actor and unsung veteran of a number of indy films, in this one plays Anthony ""Banco"" Banconi, a co-worker and friend of the McBeth's who significantly figures into the tragedy as it ultimately plays out.  Corrigan has the talent and just the kind of charismatic screen presence the role of Joe called for, and it's too bad that Morrissette and casting director Avy Kaufman didn't recognize the possibility that was right in front of them.
They did strike gold, however, with the casting of Tierney as Pat McBeth.  She has a naturally endearing screen presence and expressive eyes that can speak volumes, which she uses to great effect here.  And, as she's demonstrated since becoming an integral member of the cast of TV's ""ER,"" she plays extremely well to her ""dark"" side, which is precisely what the role of Pat called for.  Needless to say, she does it quite well, turning in an altogether convincing and entirely believable performance.
Another actor who plays so well to his dark side, Christopher Walken, does a solid turn here as Lt. Ernie McDuff, the investigator probing the shady goings-on at Duncan's hamburger stand.  In any role, Walken has a subtle, commanding presence, and this is no exception; here, though, he lends something of a light touch to the proceedings that is nevertheless in keeping with the seriousness of the story.  Suffice to say, he does black comedy well.  And, without question, it is Walken who ""makes"" the final shot of the film.
The supporting cast includes Tom Guiry (Malcolm Duncan), Andy Dick (The Hippie Jesse), Amy Smart (The Hippie Stacy), Timothy ""Speed"" Levitch (The Hippie Hector), Geoff Dunsworth (Donald Duncan), John Cariani (doing a hilarious turn as Ed the Cop), Nate Crawford (Robert/Richard) and Timothy Durkin (Frank the Pharmacist).  It may not be especially memorable, but ""Scotland, Pa."" is just quirky enough to be a worthwhile entry in the Put-A-Spin-On-Shakespeare festival, currently playing on a DVD or video near you.",1038009600,4,5591,4.932907348242812

Walken is great, and the rest of the cast, most of whom I hadn't seen in movies before, was great.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjys a tongue-in-cheek type comedy.  The adaptation of the original MacBeth's incessant handwashing was hilarious, as are Chris Walken's motivational tapes.",1037923200,,449,4.518518518518518

There are some great contemporary films that play with shakespeare's plots: Joe Macbeth, Men of Respect, Thorn of Blood, to name just a few. This is the most current. It is great fun to reread the play and then follow the film to see how the story line is carried off. And, it is carried off well in this film; check this film out.",1036886400,,379,4.135135135135135
1755199,5,B00006G8IB,"Scotland PA is made all the better after a quick re-read of Shakespeare's MacBeth. Darkly comic, this movie made me feel entertained the whole time. The soundtrack is absolutely one of the best that I have heard in a long time, especially good since I'm usually not a fan of classic rock. Bad Company plays predominately in the movie, the best use of their title song used in Witches' Brew Bar as Mac begins to scheme. Pat McBeth is fantastic and hot, again especially hot since I'm not into girls. Her composure and sense of style rocks, creating a villianess that you want to be your best friend. Scotland, PA oozes seventies style and appeal, drawing you into the plot of two twenty-somethings as they grasp for that golden french fry we call ambition and power. See this movie if not for anything but to watch something darkly fun and bitingly comedic.",1036800000,4,856,4.6381578947368425
1755200,4,B00006G8IB,"This was an entertaining send-up of one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, with most of the players delivering stand-out performances.  The one actor who I thought missed the mark was an unusually less-than-over-the-top Christopher Walken, ironically one of my favorite actors (his participation gives the movie instant indie credibility, but his role, though prominent in the story, is not blessed with a significant amount of screen time).
>
As a black comedy it stands on its own (it could be adequately described as a full-length episode of ""That '70's Show"" with a Shakespeare theme); familiarity with ""Macbeth"" is helpful, but not a necessity.  The most revealing insight found within the DVD's bonus materials is during the director's interview wherein he states he made the movie for all the kids he knew in school who read the Cliff's Notes and got stoned all the time.

Shakespeare fans who need a dose of irreverence (you know who you are) will appreciate this movie, and anyone who's having to battle their way through ""Macbeth"" will certainly appreciate the parallels with the play that are both well-scripted and lovingly filmed.  Give it a shot.",1036627200,2,1160,5.06282722513089

1755202,4,B00006G8IB,"This movie had me laughing from beginning to end.  Especially the end scene with Christopher Walken.  True belly laughs from a great movie.

The great thing about MacBeth, and this movie, I guess, is the belief in supernatural justice and morality.  If they had just worked and waited for a few years, they could have owned McBeth's legally, but, no, their ambition was too big for their morality.

James LeGros and Maura Tierney played a perfect upwardly-mobile seventy's couple resplendent in middle-class utopia of the era.  Walken was in one of his funniest, sharpest roles ever as a peace-loving vegetarian gumshoe.  All-in-all, a great flick set in the great state of Pennsylvania.

1755204,5,B00006G8IB,"As an English teacher who has taught Macbeth to bored students for year after year after year, I love Shakespeare, but could never get most of my kids beyond the ""OH NO! SHAKESPEARE!""  attitude.  This is the film that could do it, if only I could show it in class.  I can't, unfortunately, because of the very liberal use of profanity (about every fourth word is the f-word).  For myself, however, the film was an absolute joy.  It is set in 1970s Pennsylvania, and the power struggle is over a fast food joint, not a country.  The film script follows the original script relatively closely, but with a wink and a nod, and tongue firmly in cheek.  The first half is hysterically funny, especially for those who know Macbeth and can pick up on the sly references (Witches' Brew Beer!  A food fight that sets up Joe McBeth as Duncan's favorite!).  The murder of Duncan is particularly strange and funny.  The second half gets progressively darker, and the suspense starts to really pick up.  Maura Tierney is amazingly on target as (Lady)Pat McBeth, although Joe McBeth (James LeGros) is played as kind of stupid. Christopher Walken is typically sly and strange as Detective McDuff.  I also enjoyed the perceptive (but brief) interview with the writer/director in the Afterthoughts section of the extras on the DVD. I just find this film to be a wonderful example of why Shakespeare is the greatest writer of all time; 11th century Scotland or 1970s McBurgerland, this story of ambition and madness remains the same at heart.",1035158400,36,1523,4.770992366412214
1755205,5,B00006G8IB,"A clever retelling of the tragedy of  MacBeth.  Rather than being the loyal vassal to the King of Scotland he is the dedicated sort-order cook for the workaholic restaurant proprietor, Norm Duncan.  Inevitably Joe's wife decided that the time is now for these ""underachievers who need to make up for lost time"".  After the tragic and mysterious death of the owner, the couple is able to buy the place at a discount from the dead man's sons.  Once ensconced as the owners they make a stunning number of changes including big red arches, a drive-thru, and little fried chicken pieces (called little chicken  MacBeths).  It all seems so perfect until the details start to unravel.  A policeman named MacDuff is investigating the murder of Duncan, MacBeth's best friend starts asking questions about where the couple was the night of the murder, and Mrs. Macbeth develops an obsession with a grease burn she got on her hand.
This was a movie well worth the money.  It was funny from one end to the other.  It reminded me of the comment that Kissinger once said about academia ""The Politics are especially vicious because the stakes are so small"".

1755250,5,B00006G8IB,"Aristotle defined tragedy as being about people better than us, in character and class, so it is about kings and such. For him, comedy was about people worse than us, morally and monetarily, so it's about slaves and crooks. What does resetting Macbeth in a fast-food restaurant do to the work?
Surprisingly a lot. This is a comedy, and there are genius funny scenes, but the class dynamics are illuminating as to the tragic punch of the work. When we watch Shakespeare set in medieval England, it is somehow meet and fitting that noble claimants to the throne will kill rivals in the interests of power, money, and glory. When the stakes are a small town restaurant, things change. The murders much more grisly and disturbing. They are not played (just) for laughs.
This is a glorious mix of comic and tragic, and well cast and acted too. If you are teaching a course on tragedy and theory, I would recommend this film over all others.",1415318400,3,935,4.63855421686747

1755301,3,B00006G8IB,"Scotland, PA is Billy Morriessette's incarnation of Shakespeare's MacBeth.  William Shakespeare may be rolling over in his grave.  The idea to take a classic and turn it into an updated drama is certainly not new.  Although the 1970s setting of MacBeth certainly adds an interesting aspect to the story.

Joe (James LeGros) and Pat McBeth (Maura Tierney) work hard in the fast food business.  Joe has a lot of great ideas, but never seems to get recognition from the owner, Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn).  When Norm hits on the idea to add a drive through to his restaurant, the McBeth's hatch a plan to take the old man out.  There plan goes awry, but they manage to divert attention away from themselves in the short term.

The McBeth's turn their restaurant ideas into a cash cow.  They are thriving with their drive through window and chicken nuggets.  However, Joe's friend Banko (Keving Corrigan) is starting to suspect the pair.  Between Banko and a nosy Lieutenant (McDuff, played by Christopher Walken), things begin to unravel.  The McBeth's suffer from hallucinations brought on by their guilt and don't seem to be capable of holding their lie together as events spin out of control.

The dialogue and characters in this film are a bit flat for my tastes.  The writing seems to have started from a great inspiration (placing the events in the culturally unique 1970s), but failed as a story.  It was interesting to see some of the tongue-in-cheek humor and allusions to 70s culture.  It gave the film a connection that helped me get past the otherwise weak writing.

The performances weren't bad, but the script did not help much.  Christopher Walken has an odd screen presence that I have always liked.  He brings an instant quirky charm to his roles.  He may seem typecast at times, but I like him.  Tierney was awesome while LeGros was decent.  Rebhorn played a pretty good straight-man for some cheap visual gags.  They worked okay because of his deadpan delivery.  Overall, the quality of the cast exceeded that of the script.

The single factor I most enjoyed about Scotland, PA was the setting.  The 1970s was recreated with loads of subtle imagery.  Even an old-school overhead projector was featured as a background prop in one scene.  The vehicles, clothing and sets all had a campy 70s feel that was enhanced by the carefully selected soundtrack.  The music added a fun element to the story that helped keep my mind off the forgettable script.

While rated R, this film was not that objectionable.  A streaking scene at the end of the film probably got it bumped up from an otherwise PG-13.  It should be fine for teen audiences and above.

Billy Morrissette is no William Shakespeare.  His writing left a lot to be desired.  He was smart to place his story in the 1970s, where the music, sets and costumes were able to help carry the story.  The performances were also better than the actual writing.  It is a forgettable story, but a fun, quirky, campy trip back to the 1970s.  This film is not for everyone, but I would mildly recommend it with three stars.",1300492800,,3080,4.730696798493408

1755326,3,B00006G8IB,"Scotland, Pa., a film inspired by Shakespeare's Macbeth, proves steroid infused and grinningly delicious at times but leaves one with an artificial aftertaste.

Just how original is this production supported by Lot 49 Films and Billy Morrissette's direction? To ask this question fairly one must also ask how original Shakespeare's tragedy was to begin with.  The answer, not very.

Both the drama's driving forces are greed, justice, and the universal question of fate as ""Mac,"" played by James Legross, usurps Duncan of Duncan's diner with a number of casualties along the way.  The basic plot and character roles are nearly symmetrical. Lady Mcbeth eggs Mcbeth on, some `witches' stand on the cusp of reality and the supernatural, chance and fate, Lady Mcbeth's anguish manifests itself on her hand, and the laudable Mcduff opposes Mcbeth.

It is important to note the origin of any story, and whether any offspring successfully reinterpret, and in this case, modernize it.  Many artists openly admit they don't conceive of every element in their work as much as they inter-mingle them.  Therefore, comparison of the frame is essential but the organic (or less than) art therein is the true subject of evaluation and whether or not it resolves its own unique conflicts.  After all, should we write off Shakespeare's Macbeth because he borrowed an outline from Holinshed?

Morrissette successfully modernizes the practical details from the original Macbeth.  Who better to replace the mystical role of the witches than hippies? How more aptly to exile Detective Mcduff from the scene than have Lady Mcbeth give him a false scent? and where more `punny' to set the film than in a Scotland, Pa: Scotland being a town named after Holinshed and Shakespeare's setting and a P.A., alluding to another name for innovative idea of a drive-through, that leads Mcbeth to indignation, and the murder of his boss, Duncan?

Christopher Walken plays detective Mcduff, and, as usual, has the most unique and believable stage presence.  Just like Dustin Hoffman and the young Jack Nicholson, he translates himself into the role without shedding his charm.  He first appears at Duncan's funeral, then begins his investigation when he struts into the newly built Mcbeth's fast food joint to the dismay of the Mcbeth couple, who Pat Mcbeth, played by Maura Tierney, succinctly describes as ""underachievers that have to make up for lost time.""

The interrogation scene is where the film starts taking flight due to the actors' chemistry, compiled with the post-production's chemistry with the footage.  Walken interviews employees to the backdrop of a hardly noticeable, and therefore appropriate, instrumental track that mirrors his quirky character interaction and the underlying suspense.  He even elevates the usually histrionic Maura Tierney (at least as Pat Mcbeth) to his caliber in their scenes together.  On the same note, he might serve as a foil to other actor's scenes because his are just so artful.  The only other noteworthy acting is Kevin Corrigan as Anthony 'Banquo' Banconi, playing a seemingly oblivious, but all too observant underling.  His anything-but-haphazard haphazard look, voice and casual gestures create his character, whereas the audience finds itself questioning whether it is James Legross, or Mcbeth who is clueless.

Apart from the interrogation scene, the music is a miss with scattered tracks that don't resonate beyond their scene.  Songs include a predictable ""Moonlight Sonata"" at Duncan's funeral and an entire, weary catalogue of Bad Company songs, the only partly suitable one being ""Can't Get Enough"" during Malcolm Duncan's decision to leave his rock gig and reconcile with his father, coinciding with his frialator death.  Too often the music functioned solely as a segue between scenes, a bad idea altogether, or a crutch to define mood rather than reinforce it.

The only consistent production aspect of the film was the lighting and setting.  Throughout the film, especially in the outside during the night, the viewer senses the ominousness essential to the tragedy aspect of this tragicomedy.  Even when at bars, Duncan's dinner, or the Mcbeth's upper-class home, the production achieves this mood accompanied by a respective griminess or tackiness expected in the backwoods of Pennsylvania in the 70's; for this, dual cheers to the lighting crew and set designers.  But even consistency doesn't necessarily equate itself with quality.  The real tragic flaw is Morrissette's inability to recognize the clich, silhouetted face--half shadowed, half illuminated.  By the second time this started to get old, let alone the fifth.

Perhaps the most unique flip served with the modern day Macbeth is the theme of nutrition, a fully developed concept within the film.  Mcbeth is a blood thirsty carnivore and Mcduff is a vegetarian.  What each character eats is the true demarcation between their goals and values, and therefore the deeply rooted necessity for conflict.  This idealogical conflict interjects into their characters--Mcduff talks about his wife's baba ghanoush; dialogue--Mcbeth sarcastically tells Mcduff that the spirit he is mixing him is made from a vegetable; and even the plot--Mcbeth shoves a burger into Mcduff's mouth behind a establishment sign reading ""Mcbeth's,"" soon to be ""Mcduff's,"" (a vegetarian establishment).

When all is said and credits run, you walk away from Scotland, Pa. feeling catered to if at least for the fact that Walken's Mcduff wins out.  Besides that, the experience is like dipping a french fry in baba ghanoush; indigestible and imbalanced as a whole, but with true, unadulterated flavors shining through.",1240358400,,5683,5.312849162011173
1755327,5,B00006G8IB,"As director Billy Morrissette points out in a preview accompanying the movie, SCOTLAND, PA is Macbeth but for high school students who struggle with Shakespeare, who are stoned, or both.
Shakespeare's tale of the Scottish warrior turned king is moved from medieval Scotland to 1970s America.  Norm Duncan (James Reborn) owns a popular local diner named Duncan's.  He's a respective businessman in the small town of Scotland, PA and his hardest-working employee is Joe ""Mac"" McBeth (James LeGros).  Mac's best friend, Anthony ""Banko"" Banconi (Kevin Corrigan) gives Mac some inside information about some embezzling that the manager, Douglas McKenna (Josh Pais), is involved in.  Mac and his wife, Pat (Maura Tierney), Doug in the act, inform Duncan, and watch as he's fired and thrown out of the restaurant.  Mac thinks it's his big break, but Duncan only promotes him to Assistant Manager.  Tired of being an ""underachiever trying to make up for lost time"", Pat convinces Mac to take drastic action.  She wants Mac to kill Duncan, but he can't bring himself to kill the man.  But gravity takes over and Mac doesn't have to.  Thus begins a rise to power for the McBeths who watch over as the business blossoms.  Duncans becomes McBeth's, a fast food restaurant complete with the first drive-thru window in town and a French fry truck that drives around town delivering free French fries.  But something's rotten in the town of Scotland and a big shot police detective named McDuff (Christopher Walken) is assigned to investigate Duncan's murder.  As McDuff unravels what has happened, the McBeth's struggle to hold on to the happy life they have now acquired, no matter what the cost.

The movie does an excellent job at updating the story of Macbeth for modern audiences.  The film does skip some of the psychological buildup of Act IV of the play and the ending seems a bit rushed (that's partially because of finances and time issues with the filmmakers).  Nevertheless, the heart of the story remains intact.  Also, unlike the play (which except for witches farting and the Porter, has very little comic relief) the movie is very funny.  It's a dark tragic-comedy.  I was an English major and I teach English and I love the movie.  However, I know that there are some diehard Shakespeare buffs who are upset that the film cuts so much out from the original play.  I don't have an issue with it because the movie stays true to the spirit of the original play.

Overall, a highly entertaining and imaginative update of Macbeth that any Shakespeare fan or movie buff should see at least once.  Also recommended for reluctant high school students and stoners.",1200528000,2,2658,4.899328859060403
1755328,5,B00006G8IB,"In his directorial debut, Billy Morrissette brings us the best adaption of William Shakespeare to date in the world of film: 'Scotland, PA.' Morrissette, also the writer of this movie, effectively adapts the classic tale of MacBeth into the blue collar world of a fast food restaurant in the 1970s. Joe McBeth (James LeGros) and Pat McBeth (Maura Tierney) are a pair of workers in a local fast food restaurant called Duncan's, but Joe has many ideas for innovations and the pair conspire to murder the owner of Duncan's when their advancement is stifled and ideas are used by the management. This action brings into effect the remainder of the movie detailing a cover up reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Simple-Plan/dp/6305417830/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Simple Plan</a>, but with the addition of absolutely brilliant comedic performances by the cast and writing on the part of the director. The murder itself, and the ensuing cover up, is investigated by the local police by Lieutenant Duff (Christopher Walken).

Chistopher Walken is absolutely brilliant in his role as Lt. McDuff, which either because of his style, or past performances, is only enhanced by the writing which Morrissette brings to the script and results in absolutely hysterical laughter from the audience. The soundtrack is perfectly fitting with both the modern and older elements brought into the film with an inspired mixture of classical works and classic rock songs from the seventies. Though 'Scotland, PA' is an exceptional movie, it could have been improved to remove the dragging feeling in several areas during the funeral scenes and introduction. Casting for the film could have been improved by the replacement of Maura Tierney as Pat McBeth as her performance degrades the overall quality of the picture.

1755329,5,B00006G8IB,"As an English major and English teacher, I am definitely not the audience this was intended for.  In the commentary, the director says that it's all well and good if the typical Shakespeare lovers embrace the movie, but he's really making it for the pot smokers who've never even heard of Macbeth because they were too busy getting high to bother reading the play or even show up for class (loose paraphrase from what I remember when I watched this a year or two ago).  But whether or not it was made for people like me, I loved it.  Some of the low ratings have been attributed to the fact that it's just taking an old story and modernizing it.  Sure, people who write stories from scratch deserve a ton of credit, but there is also a great deal of creativity involved in telling an extremely well known story in a totally fresh way.  Scotland, PA succeeds there.  There were also some complaints about the fact that they don't use the Shakespearean English in this adaptation.  I personally enjoy watching new versions of Shakespeare's plays both ways--Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet speaks to me in a totally different way than West Side Story, but they both speak to me.  I wish I could share this film with my students so they could see how ""cool"" Shakespeare can be.  It would be a great example of the timelessness or the themes or the range of directors' interpretations.  Alas, I doubt I'd ever get this one okayed by the administration...

Christopher Walken is hysterical as vegeterian Detective MacDuff and makes Macduff a vivid, rounded character.

Note to teachers: preview the film before showing it to students.  There is cursing and there are two scenes which you may find questionable and want to censor.

1755331,3,B00006G8IB,"`Scotland, PA' released in '01 is a dark, witty, black comedy that redefines Shakespeare for a new generation. Well not really, but overt Shakespearean elements are definitely present in this wonderfully quirky, highly enjoyable Indie film starring James LeGros, Maura Tierney and the always wacky Christopher Walken.

Synopsis: James and Maura star as Mac and Pat McBeth (doesn't that reference slap you right in the face). Mac and Pat both work at a diner in Scotland, U.S.A. There growing dissatisfaction with the owners hiring decisions finally pushes the couple over the edge when he announces the appointment of his teenage son to the vacant manager position instead of Mac. Aided by the advice of three imaginary hippies (McBeth's witches) that appear and disappear at pivotal moments in the storyline poor, confused Mac and Pat decide to rob the diner and use the money to begin a new life somewhere else. However their little robbery inadvertently turns into murder and from that moment on their plans take on drastic and unforeseen changes. Unexpectedly an out-of-town Lieutenant named Mc Duff (Christopher Walken) is assigned to the case and things progress from bad to worse when he begins asking too many questions.

`Scotland, PA' is a clever film with lots of inventive twists and turns. It does however lose a little steam towards the end which is why it receives -3 1/2 Stars- instead of 4.",1177372800,,1407,5.034334763948498

Instead of fighting to take over a kingdom, the main character, Mac, is taking over a fast food joint from his lazy boss in the 1970s. It contains the f word a few too many times, but is a wonderfully dark and funny movie. The soundtrack, consisting of many classic songs, contributes strongly to the movie.

""Scotland, PA"" gets better after a couple of viewings, allowing some of the subtle gags become more clear. One example of a subtle joke in this movie is the fact that most of the characters drive classic Chevy Camaros, and one of the songs in the soundtrack is ""Beach Baby,"" which includes lyrics about everyone driving a Chevrolet.

1755365,5,B00006G8IB,"""Scotland, PA"" was a hilarious adventure for me.  I laughed hysterically.  (I didn't realize until I read professional reviews that the film didn't work because they tried to make it a comedy.)  For me, that was the point!  It hit the ""Fargo"" tragicomedy mark with a bullseye.  I am SO jazzed about this film!

In the DVD extras, director Billy Morrissette says that he's not trying to reach your classic Shakespeare crowd.  His goal was to take the Bard and adapt it for kids, more the french fries & milkshakes in the convertible crowd.  For his first feature as a screenwriter and director, he hit the mark.

Morrissette has a good resume as an actor, having appeared in ""Catch Me If You Can"" for which Christopher Walkan was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  It's an interesting connection that leads Walkan into the role as the police detective McDuff.  While ""Scotland, PA"" is not going to earn him another Oscar to go with his ""Deer Hunter"" statue, he does give a great performance as the savvy detective.

Maura Tierney who plays the ER OB/GYN nurse Abby on TV is married to Morrissette.  As Pat McBeth, she does a delightfully crazy job of going nuts.  The film starts out riotously funny and then turns darker toward the Shakespeare story line in the second half.  Her husband Mac McBeth is played by James LeGros who I came to know & love in the 2001 season of Ally McBeal.  He's in a film called ""Trust the Man"" with Julianne Moore & David Duchovny this year.  As Mac, he's kind of dumb, but he tries real hard.  When the couple binds fast food owner Norm Duncan with duct tape and mistakenly hit him with a cast iron skillet that sends him face forward in to the fryer with his butt in the air wagging like a dog and his face turning into a french fry, I thought I would split my sides laughing as Maura & James seem so completely startled by what they did.  James Rebhorn who was the shipping tycoon in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and the doctor in ""Cold Mountain"" turns in another good performance.

Kevin Corrigan plays the fry cook Banco who appears to know too much.  His demise adds to the demented fury of Mac's descent into madness.  Corrigan acted in a film last year called ""Sexual Life"" that also starred James LeGros.  One thing ""Scotland, PA"" achieves is a real sense of ensemble in the cast.  Amy Smart from ""Bigger Than the Sky"" plays the fortuneteller with Andy Dick & Timothy Speed Levitch as the two stoners who talk about chicken.

The film moves briskly.  Morrissette's screenplay creates a new hybrid from the Shakespeare storyline.  It was worked extremely well.  Bravo!",1128988800,3,2615,4.577586206896552

1755367,5,B00006G8IB,"This is some of the most fun I've had watching a movie.  I took it as a blind recommendation and it has become one of my favorite comedies in years.

Using Shakespeare's Macbeth as his source, former actor Billy Morrissette makes (I believe) his feature film debut as an actor with this brilliantly dark (I know, I'm oxymoronic) comedy.

Set in the depressed town of Scotland, Pennsylvania circa 1973, Morrissette turns Shakespeare's original story about a power hungry wife pushing her too contemplative husband into a bloody post-regicide reign into a tale of an over ambitious wife pushing her dullard husband into murder to take over a fast food joint.  Morrissette had obvious fun playing with the characters names and using them to even propel the story.  There is of course our anti-hero/heroine Joe ""Mac"" and his wife Pat - the McBeth's, both of whom work for Duncan, the owner of (what else) a donut shop.  Through shrewd manipulation Pat pushes.  There's also Lt. McDuff (Christopher Walken seemingly having more fun than he has in anything I can recall him in); Banquo - becomes Banco, and Shakespeare's witches/weird sisters become an unholy trio of drugged out hippies (deliciously played by Andy Dick, Amy Smart and Tim Levitch.

Acting honors go all the way around but James LeGros and Maura Tierney get special mention as the unholy couple.  LeGros captures the perfect 70's dullard, small time dreams, clueless and nearly almost ruining everything.  He's a delight to watch.  Ms. Tierney - an actress who singlehandedly kept me from ever watching E.R. nearly shocked the life out of me by actually proving to be an amazing actress.  If for no other reason (but thank God there are plenty of 'em) the movie would be worth watching for Tierney's most delicious, crazed performance of the film.  Her transparent subtlety is almost menacing and her greedy ambition is mouthwateringly contagious - you want her to get away with everything.

1755411,5,B00006G8IB,"Scotland, Pa. is a brilliantly weird adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth; you don't have to know Shakespeare to enjoy this dark comedy but it helps (and does a lot to explain just how a movie as strikingly odd as this ever got made).  Forget kingdoms, wars, vassals, and all that jazz; the kingdom to be won here is a burger joint in early 1970s Scotland, Pennsylvania.  Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn) sets out to prove he can sell more than just doughnuts by opening a fast food restaurant, which he hopes to bequeath to his son Malcolm.  Among Duncan's employees are Joe ""Mac"" McBeth (James LeGros) and his wife Pat (Maura Tierney), short-order cook and waitress, respectively.  Mac is, in all honesty, a fairly stupid, unappealing loser, while Pat is a hot little number indeed with ambition and a perverted sense of justice.  Tierney's eerie resemblance to Jennifer Aniston kept me fascinated through the first half of the movie, at which point my growing disappointment was finally transformed into respect and enjoyment.  Anyway, Pat is pretty disgusted when - thanks to the McBeths, the current manager is sent packing - Duncan names his son Malcolm, who hates both his father and the fast-food joint, manager over her husband, who has always had ""good ideas"" about improving the place.  Duncan makes the mistake of telling the McBeths his revolutionary idea that will transform the entire fast-food industry, at which point Pat sets her hapless husband on a course of lies and murder.  Mac is also inspired to act by a group of stoned hippies and their magic eight ball telling him that he will succeed in his criminal endeavors.  Soon thereafter, the McBeths have bought the joint for a song from Malcolm and set about living the lives they thought they deserved long ago, suffering in the process no more than a burn on the hand of the lovely lady (those deep fryers are going to throw grease, you know, especially when something as big as a human head plops down in them).
Naturally, problems soon arise.  Lieutenant McDuff (played fabulously by Christopher Walken) is sent to aid the inept local police in the murder investigation.  Friends begin to pose ""problems,"" so naturally those who pose a threat have to be dealt with.  Pat soon begins to lose control over her still hopelessly inept yet more forceful husband, and she resorts to unleashing a barrage of ointments and such on her burned hand while Mac goes out and ""handles"" things himself.  By this point, mid-way through the film, I was thinking this movie was a big disappointment and basically just stupid.  It all came together soon thereafter, though, due largely to the brilliant performances of Walken and Tierney.  The aspects of Shakespeare's play that are incorporated into the plot are numerous and impressive, in a really weird sort of way, and the ending comes off amazingly well.  I think a little more plot exposition on the part of Pat's character would have made things even better, but this movie definitely won me over in the end.
As I said, you don't need any in-depth knowledge of Macbeth in order to understand and enjoy this movie, which is incidentally accompanied by a pretty rocking soundtrack featuring Bad Company and a few other rocker groups from the early 1970s.  Some of the more out-there aspects of the story, such as the stoned weirdoes standing in for the three ""witches,"" may not make a lick of sense to the Shakespeare-deprived mind, but the quirkiness and overall atmosphere of the film should have a certain appeal to all of those who enjoy letting their minds wander slightly off the beaten path from time to time.  I should warn you that Andy Dick appears in the film as one of the stoned weirdoes; had I known Andy Dick was in this movie, I would probably have never watched it, but mercifully his appearances are short and bearable, and his very presence can be subsumed by one's fascination with the incredible performances of Walken and Tierney.",1070755200,3,3959,4.82274741506647

1755413,5,B00006G8IB,"Scotland, Pa is a modern view of Shakespeare's MacBeth.  In saying this, the watcher must understand that Scotland isn't exactly what Shakespeare had in mind, yet it is a sassy, imaginative, outstanding version of the classic work.
 Creatively portrayed, ""Mac"" (short for `McBeth', not `MacBeth') is a young man working at `Duncan's' fast food joint.  He feels underappreciated at his job, as most do, especially when he wife, Pat McBeth, is continuously reminding him of just how undervalued he is.
 James LeGros, director and star, draws fascinating parallels between the antique MacBeth and the new age Scotland.  In Scotland, Mac throws out a couple of obnoxious teens about to cause of food fight at Duncan's.  This is supposed to simulate MacBeth's heroic battle fight in the beginning of the book.  Another replication would be of the Weird Sisters.  In the book, there are three witches prophesying MacBeth's future.  LeGros' vision changes the witches into three pot smoking teenagers (one being Andy Dick).  The idea was very creative, I must say, and it really works.  Mac accidentally stumbles upon the high-as-a-kite kids at a mysterious carnival and upon entrance to a fortune telling booth, he receives stories of his future.
 The fabulous creation of Scotland is made possible by an all star cast.  The director casted himself as Joe ""Mac"" McBeth, and did a wonderful job.  He really was able to recreate MacBeth's emotions throughout the work.  ER's Maura Tierney portrayed ""Pat McBeth"", or Lady MacBeth.  Her charismatic performance enhanced the movie's carriage.  Tierney particularly shined during the scenes where she thought there were burn marks on her body, caused at the scene of Duncan's murder.  Crazed and pathetic, Tierney carries Ms. McBeth strongly until the end where she severs her own hand.
 Scotland begins to climax once Banquo realizes the mischief the McBeth's are creating.  Banquo begins to point the finger at Mac, Mac notices, and shoots Banquo.  After piecing evidence together very, very slowly, Lieutenant McDuff has a final showdown with Mac, where, as the book and movie coincide, Mac falls to his death.
 LeGros' fabulously done version of MacBeth is definitely worth watching.  I highly recommend it to all, regardless of any previous knowledge of MacBeth.  One could certainly go in, never having read MacBeth before, and completely understand what was going on.  For those who have read MacBeth before, it is a great way to further your understanding of the classic book, and to see a great twist in LeGros' vision.

While amusing at times, I found ""The Last Supper"" much funnier and found myself falling asleep in this one. When someone is killed off in a black comedy, I'd rather not be feeling so bad for them. This victim is so likeable it's more sad than funny when he's offed. Yes, he's annoying but he's also a hardworking restaurateur who spent his life building a business.
I'll admit, the way this movie captures 70's characters is pretty dead-on and the acting is appreciable.

1755415,4,B00006G8IB,"Given that Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood"" is out there any other director wanting to do a transposition of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" would have to want to go in a different direction, which is what Billy Morrissette does with ""Scotland, PA.""  My reductionalistic take on this 2001 film would that it crosses ""Macbeth"" with McDonalds, but that is rather simplistic and too cute to do this wicked little film justice.  However, that suggestion would certainly point to the fact that Morrissette is veering off into the realm of black comedy, that would be on point.
What little you remember about ""Macbeth"" from any previous encounter with this particular text by the Bard will probably serve you in good stead.  You are not going to be distracted by noticing strong parallels; in fact, if you see the three hippies sitting on the Ferris wheel and think of the three witches, then you are probably ahead of the curve.  As long as you know who Macbeth (James LeGros) kills and why you can appreciate the dark humor, otherwise ""Scotland, PA"" will strike you as strange beyond comprehension and only when Christopher Walken shows up as Lt. Ernie MacDuff, the cop investigating the murder, will you breath easier.  This Macbeth and his wife, Pat (Maureen Tierney), work at a fast-food burger stand back in 1972 in the titular town in Pennsylvania run by Norm Duncan (James Rebhorn).  Apparently Morrissette suffered intense psychological scarring in such a place as a lad and in the great tradition of independent film making gets his revenge on celluloid.
This Macbeth dreams of one day being manager of the place and when he learns the current boss (Josh Pais) is ripping off the place, the Macbeth turn him in to boss and await their reward.  But when Duncan decides that his two sons Malcolm (Tom Guiry) and Donald (Geoff Dunsworth) are going to inherit the place (admitted, a radical notion), Macbeth's lady gets super ticked.  When her husband's idea of a drive-through pays off she pushes him (repeatedly) to kill Duncan, knowing they can buy the restaurant from the two sons, who could not care less.  In the best line of the film she tells her husband, ""We're not bad people, Mac, we're just underachievers who have to make up for lost time.""
Most of the dark comedy in this film consists of bits that are essentially throw-aways, so be sure to pay attention (especially when the local deputy is on the screen).  The character of Macbeth is actually more of a wimp than the original and it is Tierney's Mrs. Macbeth that steals pretty much every scene she is in throughout the film (unless, of course, Walken pops up).  Appropriate to the context of the story this time around, her ""spot"" is a grease burn and in the end there is only one way to get it out.  ""Scotland, PA"" will not be a classic Shakespeare update, but it is certainly one of the quirkiest interpretations of the bard to come down the Pennsylvania turnpike.",1057536000,2,2923,4.75494071146245
1755416,5,B00006G8IB,"I loved this movie so much that I saw it once and had to buy my own copy. Although, it's a modern day McBeth, I don't think you have to know the McBeth play in order to enjoy this one. It is similar in style to Fargo, in that it's clever, funny, and dark all at the same time. You'll definitely laugh! The setting is a small town in 1970's Pennsylvania where the McBeth's work at Duncan's, a local diner. The music is great (Bad Company, Three Dog Night, etc.). Too bad there isn't a soundtrack for this one.",1049673600,3,508,4.141414141414141
1755417,5,B00006G8IB,"The one similarity everyone who reviewed this movie missed is it's striking similarity to the Cohen Brother's classic FARGO. Sure enough when I viewed the special features the director did mention that FARGO was a big influence for him in making this wonderfully dark and funny film.
I really dig this movie. Like many of the reviewers, I rented it on a whim not expecting much. After all, I live in PA so what the heck let me check out this film about a town in my home state (I've actually seen signs stating the miles to Scotland). Was I ever in for a pleasant surprise. The casting was excellent, the script nothing short of brilliant, and the acting was supurb. Add a soundtrack of Bad Company playing in the backgroud, three stoned withches, Chris Walken and you have yourself a modern day classic. If you are an action movie fan, like XXX and such, keep steppin this one isn't for you. If you liked Movies like Fargo and A Simple Plan, then step into the diner. Pat and Mac are serving up french fried murder. The sides are a couple of frame ups, secondary murders, a persistant detective (Walken) that is as bothersome to the guilty parties as gasburger residue at 2AM, two brothers, one who just wants to rock, and one who is gay, and a host of town residents each with their own quirks.  There is even a dim wit deputy type thrown in for good measure.
Will Pat and Mac get away with their vile evil deeds? Will Walken as the persistant detective serve them their just deserts? I aint telling. You just have to see for yourself, and make sure you bring some sutures, cause your side will split with laughter.",1047600000,14,1617,4.462837837837838
1755446,5,B00006G8IB,"As a fan of Shakespeare, I went into this movie expecting to enjoy it. I wasn't dissapointed - Scotland PA is wonderfully quirky while remaining very faithful to the original plot by Willie Shakespeare. Maura Tierney and Christopher Walken shine as offbeat characters in an off-the-wall comedy, but the retelling still lends itself to the universal themes of greed and ambition.
Personally, I don't see it as being nearly as enjoyable if you aren't familiar with the original MacBeth - for me that's half the fun. This retelling has all kinds of easter eggs for those who have read Macbeth, and I suspect that those who have said it isn't faithful to the original only read the cliff notes in high school.
To me, it doesn't get any better than this - a crazy dark comedy for and about the crazy dark side in all of us.",1046736000,3,818,4.571428571428571
1755447,4,B00006G8IB,"For all of you who missed ""Scotland, PA"" in the theatres, this is your second chance. Released early last year after a stellar review at the Sundance Film Festival, ""Scotland, PA"" didn't do so well on the big screens of America, but there's still time for it to be a hit on your screen.
  Billy Morrissette, writer and director of ""Scotland, PA"" works with an all-star cast including: Maura Tierney (Morrissette's real wife), Christopher Walken, James LeGros, and James Rebhorn, in this well-written, well-performed parody of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
  Joe ""Mac"" McBeth (James LeGros) and his lovely wife Pat (Maura Tierney) are two ""Underachievers who have to make up for lost time."" Tired of working for Norman Duncan (James Rebhorn) at Duncan's restaurant, Mac and Pat devise a plan to make the restaurant their own.
  Spurred by his wife's encouraging kisses and a vision of three stoned witches, McBeth and Pat break into Duncan's restaurant and give Norman Duncan a really good look at the deep fryer.
  After his father's death, Malcolm (Thomas Guiry) sells the restaurant to McBeth, who promptly frames Malcolm for Duncans murder. Banco (Kevin Corrigan), Mac's best friend (and employee at McBeth's), suspects Mac could be to blame for Duncan's unfortunate demise and takes his concerns to Lt. McDuff (Christopher Walken).
  This is a really great film whether you're familiar with Shakespeare's Macbeth or not. Of course, Shakespeare fans know how the story will end, but they'll be pleased--as I was-- by the new perspective Morrissette takes on the tragedy, and the modernization of the plot. Those of you unfamiliar with Shakespeare's Macbeth will still enjoy ""Scotland, PA"" for its clever comedy and hilarious subtext.
  ""Scotland, PA"" is a ""greasy spoon,"" ""bloody murder"" comedy. Morrissette does a fabulous job transforming Shakespeare's tragedy into a 70's cult classic with all the trimmings. Crazy decade fashions and 70's pop culture are woven throughout the movie, and they make ""Scotland, PA"" funny and believable.
  Available now at your local retail rental location,or here at Amazon.com, ""Scotland, PA"" is a must see this winter.",1045353600,3,2151,5.233236151603498

1755449,2,B00006G8IB,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I saw a little blip about it in a magazine, and it sounded hysterical. I was thrilled when I found it at the video store.
Much to my dissappointment, I found it to be annoying and boring.  Sure, the whole McBeth fast food place is funny, and Christopher Walken is a great actor (but a bad script saves no one).
I kept thinking that the son of the owner was Pat in flashback, because they both had this horrible fake, puffy hair thing going on. Then, when i saw them in a scene together I thought,""oh, well that blows that theory.""
The three witches/hippies were irritating beyond belief... I can't stand Andy Dick-I find his brand of obnoxious humor torture to watch.
Shakespeare was a brilliant writer- but underneath his fancy words lie the common themes of life, so I think in transferring his work to modern times you have to be careful-we see these themes all the time... it's the ""there are only seven stories"" factor. The setting was fresh and new, but the story fell flat, and the tragic body pile-up that appears in every Shakespearian tragedy was handled in a blase manner. I didn't care about the characters at all.
Skip it.
Another reviewer said it reminded them of the movie ""A Simple Plan."" Watch that instead. Or, if you have time, read the book by Scott Smith. It's fantastic.",1044403200,2,1336,4.54356846473029
1755450,5,B00006G8IB,"Skiing at Sundance is a waste of time.  Listening to the attempt at political rhetoric coming out of Sundance is damaging to the weaker-willed individual.  On the other hand, Sundance-winning side projects of accredited actors and actresses can be entirely rewarding.

This movie is loosely based upon Macbeth, but don't expect Macbeth.  It is not Macbeth.  This movie is entitled ""Scotland, PA.""  Nowhere within either half of the title can you find the word ""Macbeth,"" nor is it subtitled ""Just Like Macbeth.""  Once over this hurdle, you can sit back and enjoy the Christopher Walken hilarity.  Small kids in the family?  Send them into the living room.  Maura drops f-bombs as though they were slowing her down.

1) the world has to be saved,
2) a streetwise kid learns a lesson about life,

1755454,4,B00006G8IB,"The indie film Scotland PA, is a fantastic retelling of MacBeth as a black comedy set at a fast food restaurant in the 1970's. Full of laughs, wonderful actors and great music, this film should satisfy just about anyone, not just the indie film crowd.
What is particularly great about it is how it sticks close to the original story of William Shakespeare's MacBeth. Well, as close as it can being set in the 70's. Instead of a husband and wife team plotting to take over the throne, the McBeth's in Scotland PA (which stands for the small town of Scotland in Pennsylvania) take over a greasy fast-food restaurant to turn it into the first drive-through in existence. You can already tell it's great fodder for dark comedy.
The story has big laughs at every twist of the plot. Some fall flat, but most are laugh-out-loud funny. But what's even better is the great characterizations the film's cast brings out. Christopher Walken is fantastic as the detective McDuff assigned to solving the murders in town. The McBeth's are also portrayed wonderfully, but all the supporting cast are equally as interesting and three-dimensional. Now that's rare, even in well-produced black comedies.
Scotland PA should be checked out by anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor, if not owned as a permanent part of their DVD collection. I highly recommend it.",1039132800,9,1349,4.869565217391305
