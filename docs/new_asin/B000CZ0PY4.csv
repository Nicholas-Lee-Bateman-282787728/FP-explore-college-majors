8102314,5,B000CZ0PY4,This is really a stunning piece of filmmaking.  Wallowitch & Ross entertained thousands throughout their years of performing cabaret in New York and London.  This documentary film is an absolute delight and a testament to Wallowitch and Ross' gifts as artists.  You will enjoy this greatly.  Sadly we lost Ross a few years back but John Wallowitch is still performing in the New York area.  He is a treasure to hear perform live.  Enjoy these amazing artists and kind lovers.,1141862400,,475,4.875

(hey, Bertram we gotcha on video....wherever you are up there!)Just when you can't take anymore of John's beautiful music, Bertram enters and you can die with the sum total of them in this classic look into these two companions in life and in God given talent. Their tribute to Irving Berlin sneaked into this thoughtful production is a touching eulogy the director saw fit to include in this visual, musical, tender production that won't let up. One complaint. I like halvah but my God two carloads?!

8102316,5,B000CZ0PY4,"If you're interested in the arts, relationships or New York, there's plenty illuminated here through Richard Morris' intimate filmmaking style.  Both of these men led incredible lives of creativity and self-expression.  Looking at just one of them would be a fascinating film.  But this film adds another dimension, because these two were life partners.  It's filled with creative insights, humor and delights in a time when the arts were less driven by marketing, and more by the spirit.",1139270400,4,488,5.217948717948718
8102317,5,B000CZ0PY4,"This film is a joy for anyone who loves dance, music, and love. John Wallowitch and Bertram Ross, two great artists in their respective fields, spend a life dedicated to their art and each other. The film through many interviews and clips of the two men themselves cuts to the core of everything that is good about being human.",1139011200,2,327,4.559322033898305
