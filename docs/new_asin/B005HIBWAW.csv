4699922,5,B005HIBWAW,For a really old movie it was good,1406505600,,34,3.375
4699923,4,B005HIBWAW,"was absolutely delightful; interesting but sad story of Dalton sisters who were not exposed to any other life, unfortunately, which made anything normal impossible. Well directed",1403913600,2,178,5.884615384615385
4699924,4,B005HIBWAW,"I actually bought this movie because it was filmed in Kanab, Utah (over 200 movies & TV shows were filmed there over the years - mostly westerns).  Howard Koch produced a lot of ""B"" westerns filmed in Kanab, Utah. I also like John Russell (from the TV show Lawman) & he was in this movie.  (I'm trying to purchase all the movies filmed in Kanab.  Kanab celebrates their film history with the WESTERN LEGENDS film festival held each August.)

This was one of the better ""B"" westerns from the 50's.  I found it entertaining, and you can't beat the scenery. The town they used in the movie is now what they call ""The Gunsmoke Set"" located in Johnson Canyon in Kanab, Utah (which you can still see a few of the buildings from the set still standing.)

There are NO subtitles for the hearing impaired.  If you like a good old Saturday matinee type western with shoot outs and stagecoach robberies, grab the popcorn and watch this movie.",1398643200,3,931,4.505952380952381
4699925,5,B005HIBWAW,"Thank you Amazon for making THE DALTON GIRLS available. Westerns in the 50's didn't usually portray woman as the bad ""guys"" holding up stagecoaches, robbing banks with guns firing and bodies on the ground. Very well done story with an attractive quartet of sisters.  Of course seeing the elegant, handsome John Russell being the good guy for a change was welcome.",1326499200,10,363,4.950819672131147
8473003,2,B005HIBWAW,"It was ok, but I have to remember this was the 50ties, and women outlaws was unheard of in the movies, so bravo for that only.",1486339200,,126,3.8846153846153846
