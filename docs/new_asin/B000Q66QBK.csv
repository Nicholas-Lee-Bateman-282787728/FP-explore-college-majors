8194642,3,B000Q66QBK,"It  was  an  intresting  subject  matter ;  Ms'  Traci  Lords  made  it  happen !!!  She  is  one  wonderful  actress.  The  hypocrites  in
 Hollywood  ought  to  get  their  s***  together!!!  She  made  a  mistake  when  very  young!!  Get  over  it!!!",1482192000,,254,4.615384615384615

8194644,5,B000Q66QBK,"Although this movie seems to get some different responses, I will say this much, this movie shows the side of a romance not shown by many movies....the side where women act like the dominant tornado of force. Traci Lords is spectacularly funny as a hardcore, forceful editor. Some people will hate it, but others, like me will watch it over and over, laughing every time.",1436572800,,371,4.723076923076923
8194645,4,B000Q66QBK,"Let's call it what it really is: a chick flick. This is the first movie where I can say Traci Lords was credible as an actress. While not her most entertaining role, she did play it better than I had expected, perhaps a bit over done at times. Maybe she was just playing herself, with a capital ""B."" Once you get past the plot, i.e. please let me have your seed and I will publish your novel, the movie becomes entertaining as Traci Lords and Paul Johansson pull off some good chemistry.",1273622400,4,487,4.304347826086956
8194646,1,B000Q66QBK,"There are good reasons to review movies before you buy them; and this is one you do not want to buy. It sounds good on the surface..'romance'..but it is more disturbing than entertaining. If you are a male who has endured an entire generation for portraying men as useless apes, good only for slapping around - and you enjoy being constantly humiliated, you'll love this. Or if you are curious as to how the feminist movement self destructed, this would be good for a term paper on the subject. Curious how in this movie we establish that men are mere beasts, and we have no use for them...yet we need to have their sperm for a baby. The father of the child is utterly insignificant and without value or purpose other than for this. This movie portrays the ultimate debasement of men. Yet at the same time present a vicious and relentless, verbally castrating, ill tempered female lead as somehow the ultimate advancement of mankind... what's wrong with this picture?
Everyone involved with this production, including the producers and directors, has the mental age and severely handicapped intellect as one might expect to find on Nanny 911. With several years of profound loss of all material possessions, and health...there is a slender hope that we might bring these addolescents out of their disgusting self absorption.",1232150400,15,1324,4.888888888888889
8194647,4,B000Q66QBK,"This highly topical romantic comedy is both funny and witty.  It does not pander with bathroom humor, but is sophisticated and intelligent. Traci Lords stars as a tough, no-nonsense career woman with buried feelings and longings she didn't know she had. She is ably supported by the hunky but clueless male lead, played by Paul Johansson; a wisecracking sister played by Sherilyn Fenn; and an older mentor/friend played by the ever-popular Mariette Hartley. All ages, from older teens to seniors, will not only ""get it,"" but will most certainly enjoy it.",1224806400,8,554,5.087912087912088
