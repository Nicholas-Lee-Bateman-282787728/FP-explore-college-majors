8334716,5,B001PUTN4I,very up to date and personal. Highly recommend for families and care givers.,1483401600,,76,4.923076923076923
8334717,5,B001PUTN4I,I show this to my nurse aide students. It goes behind the scenes and shows from beginning of diagnosis and beyond. A good learning tool for patients in need of east to understand situations.,1417996800,3,190,4.617647058823529
8334718,5,B001PUTN4I,"Use of real patients and their family caregivers made for an excellent presentation.  Truthful, sobering, factual -- sometimes difficult to watch, but that's reality, and understanding and being ready to deal with all facets of the reality is necessary...",1413676800,,255,5.538461538461538
8334719,5,B001PUTN4I,"Very sobering film to watch.  Found out many facts that just are not available to others not seeing this film.  It's an awful disease, one that we can hold off as  long as possible but not avoid completely.  So it gives us good warning of keeping all parts of our brains stimulated and challenged everyday, not just by reading or doing the same kind of puzzles all the time.  We must change our environment so that we see, vision stimulation is very important, different things.  Get outside and see all around you.  Staying in the house and doing quiet things will bring it on sooner.  Get busy with your eye brain connection.  I am 72.",1380931200,2,637,4.469565217391304
8334720,5,B001PUTN4I,I had to give a presentation on this topic in my community; and I found this program to be invaluable in getting the heart wrenching challenges of being struck by this disease or being the caregiver for an AD person.,1376524800,2,216,4.425
8334721,5,B001PUTN4I,"This is an EXCELLENT title for anybody whose life is impacted by Alzheimer's Diseae or related dementia diagnosis.  It is on par with a related titie ""The Forgetting, A Portrait of Alzheimer's Disease.""  I did not even know this video existed until I did some ""window-shopping"" on the subject of AD.  I have cared for folks who have been affected with this diagnosis in my work as a Home Health Aide.  And, now I have a family member who has received the diagnosis not of AD, but a related dementia.  In the case of my family member, there is no treatment for her problem.  About half of this program's material is stuff I knew already from various other sources.  This video is NOT for the ""faint of heart"".  It shows several people who are in various stages of AD, from those who have very slight symptoms to those who are bed-ridden & possibly close to dying.  The title is exactly correct.  It assumes that the diagnosis has been made & now, the viewer need answers to ""where do I go from here?""  Caring for someone afflicted is always individual.  There are a couple of drugs that can be given to hope to halt the progrss of the disease.  One panelist made the point of ""unless we can offer a treatment that will slow or prevent the disease, what is the point of invasive diagnostic testing?""  In ""The Forgetting"", one family member affected by his wife having AD said ""I always have to remember this isn't her, it's the disease.""  That is how I felt when the formal diagnosis was made for my family member.  The doctor said the name & finally, I had permission to join that man in ""The Forgetting"" & say ""this isn't my family member; it's the disease.""

I noticed a little icon on the cover of this video ""WGBH Boston Video"".  This ""my"" PBS station! That icon says ""volumes"" towards highest quality productions.  I did not view this program when it aired; I wish I had,  I can't say enough to recommend this title!  Even those in the medical caring vocations can learn much from this video.  It is money well spent, in my opinion.",1327104000,3,2036,4.46070460704607
