6891414,5,B00R041FIA,"This is the most amazing documentary, which does incredible justice to the book.  Edward Herrmann narrated it (and sadly, he lost his own battle, to brain cancer, just a month or so after this documentary was completed).

I was mesmerized, horrified, and unable to stop watching this when it was on PBS.  Now I bought it so other friends and family can see it, as well.

Ken Burns is an amazing producer/writer on this documentary.  Which is very person for him as well.  In an interview, he related that his mother died of cancer when he was a boy (she died just a few weeks or months after her diagnosis).

It is hard not to meet anyone, whose immediate family, friends, or co-workers who have not been touched by cancer.",1431561600,14,723,4.515384615384615

6891440,4,B00R041FIA,The video was a very good complement to the book because of the impact of seeing actual people described in the book. Seeing the children and their families deal with various forms of cancer was very emotional. Seeing the doctors and researches trying various treatments and the decision that were made under uncertainty added more emotional impact.,1467676800,2,349,5.140350877192983
6891441,4,B00R041FIA,"The first of three episodes was a bit too general for a clinician but the stories of patients and the interviews of key researchers in the later episodes are excellent.  Good for an educated lay public but not enough detail for healthcare professionals regarding the science; however, the human stories of cancer's effect were very instructive for all.",1467331200,,352,5.068965517241379

6891444,5,B00R041FIA,"As a cancer survivor, this set was especially poignant to me.  It is, in my opinion, important to try to understand this disease, especially since it touches every person either directly or indirectly.  Cancer strikes every family, given enough time.  It's not too technical, and if you've read the book ""Emperor of All Maladies"" by Siddhartha Mukherjee, then this video series will be even more valuable.  Reading the book is unnecessary, though, to appreciate the series.  It's Ken Burns's best documentary since the Civil War series from a quarter century ago.  It is NOT for children, as there are disturbing elements that will be hard for children to absorb.  Watching cancer strike young kids is impossible for me to absorb, for that matter, and Burns touchingly tells their stories, too, sometimes very personally.  Watch it over three nights.  Watch it when you can focus on the video without distractions.  But certainly watch it.",1464307200,2,939,5.078431372549019

6891446,2,B00R041FIA,"So I'm watching the 6 hour Ken Burns/PBS, ""Cancer: Emperor of all Maladies"" and I'm bashing my head against the wall, it's so frustrating to watch.

They interview like 6 Nobel prize winners for cancer research in the documentary, and every time they understand something new about cancer, immediately they discuss working on a ""new chemotherapy treatment"".

--> **Food quality, air quality, water quality, lifestyle choices, are not discussed in this 6 hour documentary on cancer** <-- I kid you not.

Dr. Sidney Farber found a chemical in the 1940's that helped leukemia kids survive for a couple months longer. People were amazed, a new children's hospital was built, and innumerable chemicals started getting tested on kids, giving us chemotherapy today.

In the 1960's there were 3 schools of thought on the cause of cancer: viruses (e.g. Epstein-Barr), chemicals from the environment, and genes. All have validity.

Eventually they figure out that every cell in the body is capable of mutating into cancer given the right circumstances. In 1971, Nixon announces during the State of the Union address a ""war on cancer"". Billions of dollars are dedicated to it in the coming years and everyone thinks progress is being made. A statistician comes around in the 1980's and shows, much to everyone's chagrin, that in fact, no, were are not making much progress on cancer.

The first episode describes how the tobacco industry ""brilliantly"" clouded the issue on cigarette safety 50 years ago...and then this documentary proceeds to do *the exact same thing*.

They say we have no idea what causes cancer: ""It's very complicated"", ""We can't pin anything down"". The epidemiologist interviewed about Love Canal, NY couldn't produce any link between the 20,000 barrels of toxic waste in the ground and cancer. Seriously?

Its mind numbing. They identified ""chemicals"" as a possible cause in the 60's, but there is no follow up. Where is the section identifying carcinogens that cause normal cells to mutate into cancerous ones? Where is the section on clean food (with natural antimutagens) *preventing* cells from mutating?

Not one diet recommendation: ""Steer clear of sugar, avoid trans fats, careful with mercury in tuna, watch your red meat intake"" - nothing. Its like the entire industry is in denial on food. I would love to know exactly when these doctors stopped believing ""we are what we eat"".

The medical establishment's approach to and treatment of cancer is completely wrong. Instead of working on prevention through cleaner food and a cleaner environment and researching treatments that compliment the body (primarily diet and lifestyle), they run around like chickens with their heads cut off for the last 40 years looking for crazy chemical drugs to give us.

A big disservice of a documentary. Keeping people in the dark on what causes cancer and then promoting chemotherapy as the best way to develop treatments? Terrible.

A sad chapter in American history. An unconscionable waste of time, money, and effort spent going down the wrong road.",1460160000,13,3057,5.141129032258065
6891470,5,B00R041FIA,"Excellent, just excellent. Please get and watch this movie.",1459209600,,59,5.666666666666667
6891471,5,B00R041FIA,Absolutely informative and worth the 6 hours of viewing. I learned so much about cancer and the most recent advancements in immunotherapy.

I can never forget the little faces of the ""many lost little angels"" at Bldg. 10 and many other centers.  I congratulate the young author and I wish him equal success in his very promising career in complementing the fight against cancers.

6891473,5,B00R041FIA,"Review of Book and Ken Burns Series:

One of the best books and also now one of the best Documentary's out there. This is a 3 episode, three disc, exploration and history of one of the greatest mass murderers of all time, CANCER. This documentary is a thoughtful, moving, emotional journey into everything about cancer and what all the doctors, nurses, researchers and victims have gone through. Possibly one of the best, if not the best research examples ever done in written form, and now film form. I have read the book also which I highly recommend and now I highly recommended the 3 Disc Documentary that Ken Burns has created. I have never been so glued, moved, brought to tears as I have by this documentary. Not only does this book and documentary explore the vast history of this horror, but it also puts a face on this monster. It showcases the pain and suffering of those who are ravaged by this beast. It gives an example of not just a word but a living, breathing human being.

Siddhartha Mukherjee is one of the finest human beings to ever grace book form, his book brought to life this horrible reality. He not only brought a face to the monster, but he allowed you to understand the history, and massive exploration for treatment and hopefully one day a cure. In a sense both Siddhartha Mukherjee and Ken Burns has given a voice to this darkness that slowly is causing thousands to die, suffer, or go through.

Cancer sadly runs in my family. My sister died of Spinal Cancer. One Aunt died of colon cancer. One Aunt died of Pancreatic Cancer. One Aunt Lung and Brain Cancer. One Uncle Brain Cancer. One Uncle Lung and Brain Cancer. One Uncle Esophagus Cancer. One Uncle Lung Cancer. My Great Grandfather Prostate Cancer. My Dad is a survivor of Prostate Cancer. So I have seen it, experienced its wrath. See the brutality of this beast. I feel the book and Ken Burns Documentary is a prime example of how to look at this Emperor of All Maladies.

A perfect book. A perfect film. Both should be owned, read and watched, taught and expressed to others. Wonderful examples of research both in written form and visual form. Perfection.",1456704000,10,2858,4.572265625

6891544,5,B00R041FIA,"Ken Burnss documentary Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies is his usual excellent quality. It is not light entertainment and not for the squeamish. It is a clear look at a frightening illness with no apologies for its horror and its unsavory politics and economics. It is if nothing else very educational, especially in the sense of giving a lay person some appreciation of the complexity and difficulty of cancer research and treatment. It is also quite effective to arouse empathy for the people whose stories illustrate how cancer affects or affected them. Some of them die and some come back from the brink of death. It is both inspiring and very sad.
This film begins with a history of cancer back to its first known reference roughly 4000 years ago by a cataloguer of illnesses who described it enough to be recognizable to us and who simply stated there was no treatment. Fortunately for us civilization has progressed in that way and there is treatment for many cancers. The early schools of thought on cancers origin- viral, genetic, and environmental- were in the end not comprehensive enough and current understanding is that it includes some of all. The politics of both the research and treatment methods in cancer are presented in a frank way describing what were dead ends and eventually-unfounded techniques. The latter were rooted partly in personal ego needs and partly in group think mentality that accepted what had been as what should be as stupidly as masses for hundreds of years accepted the divine right rationalization of monarchs. We are fortunate for the brave minority opinions willing to endure censure and blackballing to do what they believed best for patients. Human need to surround themselves with like-minded peers seems tribal at best and dangerous and bigoted at worse. Will we never let go of the need to be right and belonging in the face of destruction? We are indebted to the scientific method itself in demanding objectivity, observation-based proof, and reproducibility. It has served us better than anything else for thousands of years.
Unless you are cold as dead fish on a marble slab you will be wrenched by the people in this film who are personally touched by cancer and  who are presented over long enough time to get to know and  to see their struggles and sometimes deaths. Some are heroes who by circumstance and will to live educated science about what works and what does not. Some early researchers in radioactivity paid for their sacrifices with cancer or death, not knowing the power of what they handled.
For the scientifically inclined this film gives a sense of some understanding of the complexity and difficulty of using genetic mapping both to understand cancers origins and to tailor treatment.  The most amazing method to me is the ability to grow and harvest a persons killer T cells for rapid inoculation and sometimes wonderful results. The most optimistic parts of this film are its view of current improving treatment options and the humanization of medical treatment over a couple generations, not just in oncology but all branches. Hopefully this gloomy topic reminds of our limited time and more fortunate circumstances for many.
