5577771,3,B00BCGUJ5M,"No ""Angels With Dirty Faces""? Would have definitely considered buying this BluRay, if this gangster masterpiece had been included....Under the circumstances....no deal!",1369094400,2,168,6.681818181818182
5577772,5,B00BCGUJ5M,"Event the worst of Warner's 4 volume gangster movie collections, are a 100 times better then so many of the mob, criminal underworld movies we see today. Im just wondering why Warner's, since they own the copyrights still I believe. Did not offer us a BluRay suite of the DVD releases, rather then just the few fantastic offerings they do put on the BluRay. I hope maybe they will release all their originals that we saw on DVD on BluRay rather then limiting us to this one release, cause I loved every single one of those shoot-em ups and would love to see them all,the best and worst on BluRay. Anybody else feel the same?",1368489600,7,624,4.434782608695652

5577775,5,B00BCGUJ5M,"These are probably the movies in gangster films of all time, and worth the price. Cagney(2 movies), Bogart, Robinson, all playing vicious gangsters back in the heyday of prohibition. The 1 gangster film that stands out for me is White Heat, Cagney should have won the Oscar for the role of Cody Jarret, and the thing that creeps me out the most?... his character was like the Joker in Batman books. I wonder if Bob Kean saw the movie and pictured the Cody Jarret  character as the Joker?
All 4 movies are a must have for those who remembering them from 30's and the  40's or just want to see what real gangsters were like back then.
5 stars and 2 thumbs up to boot, I am hoping for more classic movies like these get the same type of restoration from the negatives for Blu-rays.",1430006400,,778,4.358620689655172

5577777,5,B00BCGUJ5M,"If you have not owned any of the movie, this is the ultimate way to add to your collection.  It contains the most memorable scenes in gangster movie history.  Crisp, dark, haunting, cynical black and white scenes of the glorious 30s, 40s.  I rarely give any review a 5 stars.",1401840000,,275,4.46
5577778,5,B00BCGUJ5M,"This classic movie collection, along with the great special features that go with it, highlight the rise of the gangster movie as we now know it.  Produced just after the advent of the talkies, and with no film ratings board, these movies shocked and delighted audiences.  They also made stars out of James Cagney, and Edward G. Robinson.  Interesting both for their history, as well as the films themselves, this is a must have collection for the film buff!",1400284800,,458,4.772151898734177
5577779,5,B00BCGUJ5M,A very exceptional collection of the best gangster movies.  We watched them all in one sitting on a rainy day.,1400198400,,110,4.5
5577780,1,B00BCGUJ5M,"I was greatly excited to see these four classics on Blu-Ray.  I have so far only watched one, The Public Enemy.  The quality of the transfer is disappointing.  The picture jumps around constantly, making it virtually unwatchable.  I am hoping the quality of the remaining 3 are better.",1399248000,,285,4.875
5577781,5,B00BCGUJ5M,I love the classics. they are where you find the great actors. they didn't need all the special effects. as they do today.,1399161600,,122,4.3478260869565215
5577782,5,B00BCGUJ5M,I gave this a big five star rating because if you like great gangster movies these are the best. I watched them all and let me tell you they may not have the high tech special effects of todays technology but they don't need it. With great acting and great writing you gotta love the old movies. The greats that are no longer with us but are as big as life on the silver screen. Great dvd set and comes in an attractive boxed set.,1397865600,,430,4.070588235294117
5577783,4,B00BCGUJ5M,"This isn't really a review; I just thought I'd list some important information about the films, as I noticed the Product description is lacking. I hope this information is useful:

LITTLE CAESAR - 1931 - 79 minutes - Director: Mervyn LeRoy - Starring: Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks - Genre: Crime, film noir - Plot: Rico, a ruthless and ambitious criminal, moves east and rises in the mob hierarchy.

THE PUBLIC ENEMY - 1931 - 83 minutes - Director: William A. Wellman - Starring: James Cagney, Jean Harlow - Genre: Crime, drama - Plot: A young hoodlum rises through the criminal underworld, even as a mob boss's death threatens a bloody gang war.

THE PETRIFIED FOREST - 1936 - 82 minutes - Director: Archie Mayo - Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Leslie Howard, Bette Davis - Genre: Crime, film noir - Plot: The lives of a waitress, a hobo, and a bank robber intertwine in a lonely diner in the desert.

WHITE HEAT - 1949 - 114 minutes - Director: Raoul Walsh - Starring: James Cagney, Virginia Mayo - Genre: Crime, film noir - Plot: A dangerous criminal escapes from prison and leads his old game in a daring heist. Very quickly, things go wrong.

Now let's crunch some numbers. This set costs $39.56, and contains 4 films. When we divide $39 by 4, we find a price of $9.89 per film, a fair price for this excellent collection of classic gangster films. I hope this information is helpful to you.",1397088000,18,1401,4.610441767068273

5577786,3,B00BCGUJ5M,"In DVD you get these four classics and The Roaring Twenties and Angels With Dirty Faces in a collection called Warner Brothers Pictures Gangster's Collection Volume 1.  Here in the Hi-Def upgrade you get The Petrified Forest, Little Caesar, The Public Enemy, and White Heat.
For the price of the upgrade I'm not sure it's worth losing the two other classics that are truly representative of the genre while 'The Petrified Forest' is really a stunning adaptation of a Broadway play that focuses more on human condition and folly than gangsters tho you do have Bogie's stellar debut performance as Duke Mantee.  True collectors can fuss over that.  The blu-ray editions are crisp without true remastering...but not perfect.  The sound is no better than the DVD's and it costs more.  I have both but I'm a sucker for these movies.  If you truly want to be introduced to the genre then go with the DVD collection.  The two movies it includes beside the four included in both are true classics and will expand your knowledge of how pervasive the effect of these films became.  Even the most die hard fan of the ilk know why Angels With Dirty Faces was made and why Cagney played the role.  That movie alone is worth the DVD collection believe me.",1382832000,34,1241,4.682027649769585
5577787,5,B00BCGUJ5M,"This is a great collection on Blu-ray. Four of the best gangster movies to come from Warner Bros. golden years - Cagney is amazing in The Public Enemy, Bogart & Leslie Howard equally great in Petrified Forest, and Cagney even MORE amazing in White Heat. Film transfers are excellent, the two oldest (Public Enemy & Little Caesar) look a little worse than the other two, but still have never looked better on home video than these Blu-ray's. Only complaint - we need Volume 2 with The Roaring Twenties, Angels with Dirty Faces, and the other greats.",1382400000,5,548,4.71875

5577791,2,B00BCGUJ5M,"I have to say, ""Little Caesar"" & ""Public Enemy"", MIGHT look better than on dvd ( I'm not sure I agree), but they are very crappy remasters for blu ray.  Especially considering their place in film history.  They should have done a better job.  I did not even get to the others.  I was so disappointed in the picture quality, I sent them back!  Here's hoping WB does a better job on Cagney's other films and the rest of their classic gangster films!",1369872000,5,447,4.337349397590361
5577792,4,B00BCGUJ5M,"I bought the Blu-ray of ""White Heat"" separately, but since it's included in this set, I figured I'd post a comment here.

The picture quality of the ""White Heat"" Blu-ray is very much improved over the DVD (maybe a 15% improvement to my eyes), and that's saying something since the DVD was already pretty good.  There's a tremendous amount of detail revealed in nearly every scene.  The blu-ray unveils the textures of skin, clothing, furniture, and machinery to very good effect, making the film more lifelike.

There is one shot in the opening sequence (during the train robbery) that has poor image quality, but that was true on the DVD as well.  Perhaps it looked that way originally.

Audio quality may have improved, but I didn't notice a great change from the DVD.

Overall I am very pleased with the Blu-ray of ""White Heat,"" and consider the upgrade wotth the cost.

I look forward to reading what others have to say about the 3 remaining films in this set.",1369180800,27,964,4.662721893491124
8565936,5,B00BCGUJ5M,"It has the best Gangster films Warner Bros. ever made in the 1930's. Out of the four, I like The Petrified Forest for being an out of the box in terms of the location and of the time frame of the mid-1930's.",1522195200,,207,3.9523809523809526
8565937,5,B00BCGUJ5M,"The only thing missing here is Angels With Dirty Faces, which is the single greatest gangster movie ever made. Everything else is spot on though. Wonderful collection!",1518134400,,167,5.222222222222222
8565938,4,B00BCGUJ5M,"This collection includes 4 classic films.  The best, by far, is ""The Public Enemy"".  James Cagney was the best of the gangster actors, and ""The Public Enemy"" was his best gangster picture, and therefore the best of this collection.  Next is ""White Heat"".  What a character Cody is, although I don't know who was tougher or crazier, Cody or Ma.  Next best is ""Little Caesar.""  Edward G. Robinson plays the iconic role of Rico.  Make sure you watch it before ""The Public Enemy"", otherwise you might burst out laughing when you listen to Robinson play Rico.  BTW, Robinson was much better in ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Stranger"".  Least best, but not bad (it is a classic after all) is ""The Petrified Forest"".  Bogart plays weird gangster Duke Mantee, who is likeable compared to Leslie Howard's hard to stomach Alan character.  Howard seems to specialize in playing spineless men as we see later in ""Gone with the Wind"", that time in color.  All the pictures have some weak points, but ""The Public Enemy"" has the least.  They all benefit from being short.  All are less than 2 hours long, and only ""White Heat"" is more than 90 minutes long.  If only more movies had more of the film left on the cutting room floor.  This collection might be worth 5 stars, but the caricatures in ""Little Caesar"" and the ""The Petrified Forest"" knock the collection down a notch.  Say, maybe all four of the movies should have starred James Cagney.",1496880000,,1428,4.670682730923695
