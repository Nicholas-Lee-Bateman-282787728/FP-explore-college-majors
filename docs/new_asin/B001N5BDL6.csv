3711732,4,B001N5BDL6,"We finally have Nik and Val in the white house. or so my dream goes. Still amazing after all these years. Saw them in concert last year. Nick in leather. Val still hot hot hot hot. Vitamins A&S are ALL I NEED TO GET BY. If Nick and Val cant FIX IT it nobody can. When the biopic comes out I hope it stars Alicia Keys as Val incarnate..and Im thinking Maxwell as Nik. Another dream come true. NOBODY KNOWS THE INSIDE but we are getting closer as we watch Freddy Jackson and Nik perform at Feinsteins.
The Sugar Bar is my Mecca as is the bench where Nik slept. and the White Rock Baptist Church. I hope to see them as they are my guides- the Zues and Hera of the music bix. Made ya stay married 25 years when it was not SO SOLID. I don't need no docta..just some rocking a-- that big A- Asshford and Simpson sound.. Songs in the key of my life. No more hanging round..Been Found. love the interviews.. specially at the Sugar Bar .",1233187200,,928,4.104395604395604

get this DVD and a beverage of choice, and pop this ""dvd"" into your dvd player and let Nick Ashford & Valerie Simpson, take you on their journey of love! They sing the Motown love song hits they wrote for Marvin & Tammi, plus their own hits, all performed live in a small intimate venue! The fact we lost Nick , just a few months ago, makes this ""dvd"" more significant, in that we get a chance to feel the love of a Nick Ashford & Valerie Simpson concert forever!

3711745,5,B001N5BDL6,I bought this dvd the same time I bought the cd. I listen to the cd in the car and at night I watch their concert on my dvd player. WOW!

3711748,4,B001N5BDL6,"I have been a fan of Ashford and Simpson for many years, it was a pleasure to see them perform many times in concert. This DVD was not a let down, it delivered everyting I expected from an Asford and Simpson concert.
With the recent passing of Nick Ashford, what an added pleasure to own a copy of one of their many performances.
I look forward to the pleasure of seeing them perform on this video for many years to come.",1316822400,,421,4.209876543209877
3711749,5,B001N5BDL6,"I'm a 56 going on 57 year old Black man and, I remember the glory days of Soul music!! These two people are one of my heroes! A true romance story. Too often we never hear about Black love but, this is a movie waiting to be made. This concert was an event to experience that love...one last time. I love it and, have played it multiple times for my friends who have all enjoyed enough to go get it themselves. This is a must have for anyone who believe in the power of love! I have no regrets...

I have no knowledge of whether he was or was not gay, nor do I care, but a large portion of last half consisted of non-legendary ""coming out"" songs.  Val participated, as did a third unknown member of the backup entourage who appeared to be well-qualified and enjoyed to be assisting in this ""coming out"" exercise.  I had been hoping to hear a concert devoted to the Ashford/Simpson musical output that had made them icons of the R&B/Motown era for decades; they are legendary.  That is certainly not what I got in this BluRay; I have watched it twice and I'll be donating it to Goodwill in the very near future.",1315180800,2,955,5.346666666666667
3711751,5,B001N5BDL6,"Ashford & Simpson aced this dvd!  Thank you Nick and Val for producing this keeper. I've been a fan since their Motown days when I met them, so I've had the priviledge of seeing them perform live over the years. This dvd was NOT a disappointment in any way because it showed their artistic versatility.

In the middle of their dvd, they take the time to introduce us to the music which they wrote for a play, ""Invisible Life"", based on the author E. Lynn Harris's book. Val, Nick and Clayton who is a 'Sugar Bar' (their N.Y. Club) member, portray the actors by singing 4 of the songs which are: (1) This Is Where We Meet,(2) I Don't Ride This Train,(3) Born This Way, and (4) Invisible Life. Since, I enjoy plays, I found the tunes and lyrics to be very well written because the music was very explanatory of the play. In addition, Nick & Val did an extra superb job in rendering the songs, ""Still Such a Thing"" and ""Gimme Something Real"". To see them perform these songs together as their voices blended so well is totally awesome!!! And, of course, it goes without needing to say that the old stand by's listed on the dvd are great as well!

I'm so glad we have this keeper to remember Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson's loveable performances by. The way Nick looked at Val as she performed was touching! Did anyone catch him jumping in supportive joy as she tore up the gospel song ""Changed"" at Oprah's 'Legends Ball' Sunday brunch? If not, go to youtube and check it out.

The two personal one-on-one interviews, featured as a bonus on the dvd, with Nick and Val is truly a nice way to remember them by as a team. It was a nice touch.

R.I.P. Nick. Your spirit lives on through your beautiful lyrics. May God bless Val and family and give them strength to carry on.",1315008000,,1773,4.3932926829268295
3711752,5,B001N5BDL6,I purchased this product for my sister.  She loves Ashford and Simpson.  Item came as advertised.  Thank you.,1295308800,,109,4.944444444444445
3711753,3,B001N5BDL6,"Is it just me or does anyone else share in my dis-pleasure of Ashford & Simpson always concentrating more on the songs they wrote for other singers vs. their own brilliant repetoire whenever they perform live ?  While I love EVERYTHING Nick & Val have written, produced, etc...for notable singers like Marvin Gaye/Tami Terrell, Diana Ross, and a slew of others, I fell in love with their signature sound as a result of listening to the material they specifically wrote for themselves. I still listen to the ""Is It Still Good To Ya?"" project like it came out yesterday...lol  To my surprise and great dismay, none of the songs from that stellar recording are featured on this DVD....Can you imagine an A&S concert w/o the inclusion of ""Is It Still Good To Ya?"" or ""It Seems To Hang On""?...me either!!  The highlight  of this concert IMO is their rousing and almost gospel-like rendition of ""Gime Me Something Real"".  I was also pleasantly surprised to finally hear them sing one of my all time favorites ""Stay Free"". On a darker note...literally,  they sang 5 completely forgetable songs they wrote for the soundtrack of a yet to be released movie entitled ""Invisable Life"".  When I think of the songs they could have performed in lieu of these, my blood curdles!!  I'll keep the  DVD because it's Ashford & Simpson,  but I honestly can't  see myself reaching to play it again anytime soon.",1280534400,2,1389,4.745833333333334
3711754,4,B001N5BDL6,I saw this program on cable and immediately purchased the dvd.  it is a live performance in a small club and shows the raw talent which endures.  great sould and pop performance.,1263081600,,178,4.53125
3711755,3,B001N5BDL6,"They did not sing, Is It Still Good To You, I don't understand that at all. They did some music from a play.....They could of save that for sure. Over all I like Ashford and Simpson, but I will not be watching this DVD again.",1261440000,4,225,4.022222222222222
3711756,2,B001N5BDL6,"I love Ashford and Simpson but this video didn't do it for me. Maybe it was my lack of knowledge of the songs sang, but I was not impressed. I hate to say it but I would not buy it again if I had the chance.",1253404800,3,207,3.5217391304347827
3711757,1,B001N5BDL6,this Concert was at a small dinner club... I'm sure the people that attended had a great time for it being up close and personal...but it's is not a good show.,1246665600,,159,4.161290322580645
3711758,5,B001N5BDL6,"For classic Asford & Simpson fans, this DVD is a must have. They still sound GREAT. Good variety of hits and they haven't lost an ounce of their o'l school touch. Enjoyed every drop of it!!",1239321600,,189,4.277777777777778
3711759,2,B001N5BDL6,"Anyone that can relate to this phrase knows the work of the Devil.

1.  Nick has more makeup on than Valerie. Huh?
2.  Nick doesn't have a wedding ring on his finger. Huh?
3.  Valerie sings I'm Every Woman and goes into the audience and sits in another guys lap. Huh?
4.  They sing a rendition with a gay guy about being in a gay club with each of them singing about a gay character. Huh?
5.  Nick's song was called Born This Way. Huh?

People I'm sorry, maybe I'm naive but Ashford & Simpson broke my heart with this DVD.  Reading between the lines you could clearly see where they were going with this.  I believe that Nick had sort of a coming out of the closet party.  One of the greatest songwriter duo's of all time have what I believe to be an openly flawed relationship!!  No wonder Freddy Jackson was there.  It hurt because I held them to such high standards.  But it's just showbiz right? Huh?",1239235200,3,904,4.247058823529412
3711760,5,B001N5BDL6,"I watched this DVD tonight for the first time and felt like I was right there with them. Nick and Val looked good and sounded great, and the band was tiiight. And when Freddie Jackson ad libbed on Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing, that was the icing on the cake! This DVD is a MUST HAVE for Nick and Val fans.  You won't be disappointed.",1236643200,7,338,4.121212121212121
3711761,5,B001N5BDL6,"Boy this DVD is hot, Nick and Val look and sound so good, they do a lot of my favorite songs on this dvd, the crowd really gets into there performance, they sound so good, I'm glad they came out with a dvd that shows there true showmenship, I have another concert of theres that came out in the eary 90's that was a little better, but its not on dvd, but if you can get it on VHS, get it, its better then this one but if you can't,  you won't go wrong with this one Ashford and Simpson is one of the best song writers Motown have ever had.  They wrote Diana Ross best album tod date, Diana Ross The Boss, the produce all the songs on Diana Ross's album, nobody can write any better for Miss Ross then Ashford and Simpson, If you like Ashford and Simpson, you will love this dvd! Get it now, you won't be sorry, you will be glad you did, I wish Motown still had them around, and I hope Diana Ross will get back with then, besides Chic, nobody else can write better songs for Miss Diana Ross, they know how to write songs for her, to me when the produced Diana Ross album The Boss, that song and lp was Diana's second best LP, they also did Diana Ross first solo LP, Miss Ross get these two love birds back writeing for you, they write and sing the best love songs, so Ashford and Simpson fan's get this dvd you will be glad you did.

3711762,5,B001N5BDL6,"The CD is great, but actually WATCHING a concert is better than just listening to it.  The DVD also includes four songs from ""Invisible Life.""  It's nice to finally hear some NEW Ashford & Simpson music!  I also like hearing what they have to say between songs.  The only thing wrong with the DVD is that it makes me want to be in the audience, not just watching the show on a TV screen.  I never had as much fun at a concert as I did the two times I saw A&S.  This one is a little different, but still GREAT.  I also enjoyed watching the two interviews included on the DVD.",1233964800,3,574,4.071428571428571
