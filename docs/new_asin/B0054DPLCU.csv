8456582,5,B0054DPLCU,"I hesitated to give this five stars since I'm a Phillies fan, and Joe Carter destroyed my entire world in the 9th inning, but it's classic baseball to me. This whole series was a defining moment of my childhood (I was just about to turn 12) and I wish they'd release all six games in a box set.",1384732800,2,294,4.086206896551724
8456583,5,B0054DPLCU,"Joe Carter's walk off home run to win the '93 World Series goes down as one of the all-time classics.  Baseball's not that big in Australia and I remember that this was the first World Series I ever saw on TV and it's great to finally be able to see this game again after all these years.

I would also love to get a box set of the entire series, especially that crazy Game 4 slugfest.  But being Toronto (the only non-US team) I doubt they'll ever get around to it.",1355529600,,466,4.0989010989010985
8456584,4,B0054DPLCU,"Product was exactly what I expected.  My son, who has autism, loves baseball and he asked for this video.  He researches them himself and enjoys this one very much!",1328140800,,164,4.620689655172414
