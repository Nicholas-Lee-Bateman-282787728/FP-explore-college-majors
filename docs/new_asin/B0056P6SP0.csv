4592585,4,B0056P6SP0,"This is not the best Hellraiser movie. This movie was made for less than the original film in 1989 I believe. However, it is interesting. Though this movie uses it's plot as ""two friends go looking for adventure and instead find the box and pinhead"" or whatever goes much further than you'd expect from this film. One of the friends is actually pretty wierd, freaky-he might make fans think of what would-you quess it-make a good cenobite. But he is even stranger than that, and in fact is sort of a pin-head lookalike. The idea ""switching someone else out"" is what is the real dealer though, bringing in the entire family of the two friends. Such sights will be shown.

All in all this was a pleasant suprise, and a far improvement over the atrocious Hellseeker and the just decent Deader and Hellworld (all of these movies actually cost 1 million and this one 300, 000; kind of laughable if you think about it). This movie was always meant to be a Hellraiser film. In all honesty, I'd much rather watch this than yet another remake, unless it shows a lot of backstory.

Just for some fun, favorite order:
1. Hellraiser II: Hellbound (5 Stars)
2. Hellraiser (5 Stars)
3. Hellraiser: Bloodline (5 Stars)
4. Hellraiser: Inferno (4 1/2 Stars)
5. Hellraiser: Hell On Earth (4 1/2 Stars)
6. Hellraiser: Revelations (4 Stars)
7. Hellraiser: Deader (3 Stars)
8. Hellraiser: Hellworld (3 Stars)
9. Hellraiser: Hellseeker (hate this one, 0 stars)",1316736000,4,1438,4.725099601593626
4592586,5,B0056P6SP0,"This is in actual fact not a bad film, most people have probably not even seen it and are just haters, The story is ok and probably better than the last few sequels, you see a fare amount of pinhead like you did in the originals and female chatterer and several other cenobites that look rather cool, there is bloody gore that is rather good and has classic chain deaths, pinhead himself even though its a different actor looks actually ok and is a fresh change after all these years, the makeup is good and he sounded ok, I spoke to Doug bradly at comicon and he turned down the role merely because he didn't want to do it anymore, even though this movie was only made because the studio needed to keep the rights!! I am just glad to see another hellraiser film no matter the direction its taken, for what its worth its really not that bad, its low budget but has a gritty realism and all the elements that make a hellraiser story, just accept it.",1315094400,13,948,4.301675977653631
4592587,3,B0056P6SP0,"Like my fellow reviewers, I can already tell that this addition to an already worn-out series is not going to be anything groundbreaking. Perhaps the make-up has improved somewhat, which is why I gave this movie 3 stars for the cover only, but still... How can you possibly want to improve on an icon like Pinhead? Why would you want to?

""Hellraiser"" and ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" are in the horror movie canon. I.e., they are MUST-SEES. Anybody who does not like them cannot possibly be true fans of the genre. And while Doug Bradley's presence was somewhat of a saving grace in the subsequent sequels, one cannot help but feel a bit sad. After ""Inferno"" - which I watched because of Ashley Laurence's all-too-brief appearance - I couldn't bear to see anymore.

Lamentably (no pun intended), I'll probably wind up watching ""Revelations"" anyway out of sheer curiosity if nothing else. There may be some surprises. Doubtful, but who knows?",1314489600,2,940,4.90566037735849
4592588,1,B0056P6SP0,"It's truly astouding that when you're in the same company as Hellseeker, Deader and Hellworld, you still manage to emerge victorious as the absolute worst of the lot. Hellraiser: Revelations is a truly remarkable movie that defies any sensible expectations. This movies goes beyond the incredible lows this series has reached since Inferno and almost defies physics by somehow managing to go even lower. Incredible. How do they do it?

In spirit, I like the DVD cover because it looks like Pinhead is taking a dump and it's a great metaphor for the quality of the movie you're buying. The problem is that it's not actually Pinhead on the cover. Doug Bradley, unfortunately, was too busy rearranging his sock drawer the week they filmed this. When the first photo of the new Pinhead was posted online, I e-mailed it to Doug Bradley. He replied a few hours later with, simply, ""lolol.""

Stick with the first two.",1314230400,204,910,4.826923076923077
4592589,1,B0056P6SP0,I haven't even this sorry excuse for a hellraiser movie yet and can already tell from reviews from other sites and the fact that doug Bradley himself didn't what to have anything to do with this movie that it is not going to be a worthy sequel to the long running hellraiser franchise.

4592601,3,B0056P6SP0,"Passable, not quite the worst of the franchise, and uninspired.  But at least the special effects were okay, right?

Ive waited a loooong time to finally watch this film, and I waited for a reason: the reviews were abysmal. After Rick Botas (Hellraiser VI-VIII) long run, director V&iacute;ctor Garc&iacute;a (Mirrors 2, Return to House on Haunted Hill, The Damned) boldly follows the worst sequel to come before it: Hellworld.  And not only that, but he is doing so without the very man who breathed life into Pinhead: the beloved Doug Bradley (Hellraiser I-VIII)? Yikes.  But, to his credit, V&iacute;ctor Garc&iacute;a has a filmography that I have found highly entertaining; not good, but enjoyable.  So, lets see if the litany of soul-slamming reviews match my opinion I mean, one would hope it would at least be better than Hellworld (2005), right? LOL

On a quest to get laid, a pair of Los Angeles teensNico (Jay Gillespie; 2001 Maniacs) and Steve (Nick Eversman; Once Upon a Time)decide to cross the border to Tijuana for a weekend of tequila, dead hookers and Puzzle Box experimentation.  They open the box, Pinhead appears and spews exposition at them, and their parents (including Steven Brand; Mayhem) are left wondering what happened to their missing kids for months until one of them randomly shows up to a dinner party with some strange answers.  For whatever mystical convenience, their cell phones have no signal, the land line is dead, and all the cars have disappeared.

Bloodline (1996) took us to France and outer space, Deader (2005) to Romania, and now Revelations takes place in Mexico.  And not since From Dusk til Dawn (1996) have I seen so many Mexican prostitutes murdered, which we see in flashbacks bouncing back and forth between present LA and past Tijuana.

Regarding the special effects, the gore was decent and looked visceral.  Our new puffy-faced Pinhead (Stephan Smith Collins) looks passable, the female Chatterer Cenobite (Jolene Andersen) is fine, and Pinheads Mini-Me prot&eacute;g&eacute; looks the best (best thing about the movie).  It was all fine until I had my good grief moment: two lesbian Cenobites...  Really?!?

But, you know what, that was actually forgivable.  The effects were actually pretty decent considering the humble $350k budgetimpressive even.  I especially pleased with the face-peeling scenes.  As far as special effects go, Im going to say this film was victorious at entertaining me.  Now, as a Hellraiser film?  Thats another story

This sequel replays many familiar notions while painstakingly explaining everything in no child left behind detail.  We see reconstructions of Julia bringing Frank (i.e., Hellraiser) victims to reconstitute his body; they literally open a dictionary and define Cenobite; the vagrant is here, however gratuitously forced he may feel; the Pillar of Souls looks like something from an Ed Gein butchery (all mystique squandered); and we even witness a recreation of Franks original demise.  So, what am I saying here???

In many ways, this ninth installment to the franchise is to Hellraiser (1987) what Jurassic World (2015) was to Jurassic Park (1993) or what Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) was to Star Wars: A New Hope (1977); a fan film.  And a rather failed fan film at that.

All things consideredyes, there is a dreadful Hellraiser film that tries but fails to do honor to the franchise.  However, the rather even pacing of effects-scene reveals actually make this quite a passable film (although Id still say the only sequel inferior to it was Hellworld).  Dare I say it, but to someone who knows nothing about the franchise, the fan film honoraria were probably helpful in understanding this world.",1515283200,4,3711,5.109452736318408

4592608,1,B0056P6SP0,"What a crapfest indeed.

I thought the 8th movie with the millennials in the mansion (Hellraiser: Hellworld) was terrible. Characters with totally unfitting love scenes in the middle of being chased by Pinhead. But this movie here truly redefines how bad a horror movie can be.

Pinhead is not the same Pinhead, and he sucks. Not the cold, expressionless Pinhead. The actor opened his eyes way too much, and tried too hard to be scary. The awful make-up reflects the lowest budget of any of the films in that department yet. The acting is atrocious. And the script!

The best movie is the first one, Hellraiser. The 2nd one, (Hellraiser II: Hellbound) is decent for its time, and gave you insight about facts if the first movie. I surprisingly enjoyed the 7th movie, Hellraiser: Deader.

I committed to watching them all because I started watching them, but this one here is insufferable. With the first 2, you get the essence of Hellraiser, really.",1475020800,,949,4.803680981595092

Even if the original character was not back to play 'Pinhead' I did still enjoy the story line and effects.  What I think would be cool is that the people who first came out with the 'Hellraiser' franchise, that they eventually visit the idea of revisiting the first one and maybe making a remake of the original.  Just an idea maybe after a few more installments.  I bet though that the series if done right could possibly go on for some time, before resorting to making a remake of the original.

4592620,1,B0056P6SP0,"IMPORTANT NOTICE: Hello. This is Dr. Hugh Janus, personal physician to Fred Adelman. Fred requested that I perform a lobotomy on him before he watches and reviews this film. He also requested that I put the piece of brain I removed during the procedure back in his head once he is done. I agreed, so here is Fred's review: Even with hole in head, me know this 9th movie in series is bad film. Dimension Pictures and Weinstein Brothers about to lose rights to HELLRAISER franchise, so they make this cheap movie to keep rights. Two teens, Nico (Jay Gillespie) & Steven (Nick Everson), take trip to Mexico to see donkey have sex with girl. They film everything with video camera. Nico kill girl in bathroom stall by mistake while he has sex with her. Steven film it. Vagrant (Daniel Buran) give two teens the Lament Configuration box at bar and Nico open it in motel room. Fake looking Pinhead (Stephan Smith Collins; where Doug Bradley?) appear and rip skin from Nico's body. Steven help Nico get skin back by killing Mexican prostitutes. They disappear for one year. Nico and Steven's family (include Steven's girlfriend Emma [Tracey Fairway]) have dinner in honor of sons' disappearances when Steven suddenly appear (He say, ""They're coming...the Cenobites. They don't like to lose souls.""). Emma find box in Steven's bag and open it. House shake and purple light shine, but nothing else happen. Steven begin act strange. Vagrant show up and cut off Nico father Peter's (Sebastien Roberts) face after Peter blast shotgun into vagrant and nothing happen. Steven shoot own father Ross (Steven Brand) in stomach with shotgun, but Ross not die, just hurt badly. Steven not actually Steven but Nico. In flashback, Steven refuse to kill prostitute because she has baby, so Nico kill Steven and take his skin (including face). Nico/Steven makes Emma open box and fake-looking Pinhead show up again with Cenobites (including Steven, who look like Pinhead Jr.). Pinhead rip out throat of Nico mother Kate (Sanny Van Heteren) with chain hooks and has chain hooks crucify Nico/Steven. Before Pinhead take Nico's soul, Ross kill him with shotgun which make Pinhead very mad because soul is lost. Pinhead uses chain hooks to take Ross wife Sarah (Devon Sorvari) and he and rest of Cenobites disappear. Ross die. Emma hold box in hand and film end. Even though film run short 75 minutes (includes slow 4 minute end credits) director Victor Garcia (RETURN TO HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL - 2007; MIRRORS 2 - 2010) make film seem twice longer. Screenwriter Gary J. Tunnicliffe also did makeup effects (he also direct bad film WITHIN THE ROCK - 1996) steal ideas from first and second films in series, but make film boring anyway. Me miss Doug Bradley as Pinhead. Stephan Smith Collins so bad they use other actor to dub voice. I can stick my pinky in head hole!!!! It tickles. Movie not tickle. Movie is painful. Available DVD/Blu-Ray as single film or part of triple-feature DVD from ARC Entertainment. Hole in head speaking to me. Tell me you crazy to buy, rent or steal this. Me tired. Need nap. Rated R. EPILOGUE: Dr. Janus here. I put the small bit of brain back in Fred's head and he should be as good as new in a few days. He may try to lick your face until then, but be a sport and let him. He's been through a lot. I may ask my physician for a lobotomy after watching this film with Fred, if only to forget I ever saw it. Fred also wanted me to tell you that this movie was filmed in eleven days and was the first script since the third sequel, HELLRAISER BLOODLINE (1996), to be written specifically as a Hellraiser film. All scripts after the third sequel were written as non-Hellraiser films and were changed dramatically so they could be part of the Hellraiser franchise.

4592650,3,B0056P6SP0,"Well, the franchise goes on, chasing an ever diminishing budget, and you can tell if that's what you're focused on. The movie carefully minimizes not just special effects, but also any sort of action that couldn't take place on a  small sound stage. And worst of all, the thing that die hard Hellraiser fans like me (I think I'm the only person who never disliked a Hellraiser movie until I saw the silly and awful Hellworld) have been dreading: Doug Bradley has been replaced by...some other guy. Who just isn't as good. Let's face it. How could he be.
So the movie sucks, right?
Not so.
It's actually pretty clever. By doing this as a family drama (one of the families is named Bradley, a conscious nod to DB, I'm certain) it aims wisely at both the parental generation that saw the original Hellraiser and the younger generation that everyone in marketing covets. But also, forced to relinquish special effects, latex cosmetics, Cenobites and everything for the majority of the film, the crew was forced to rely on the writing and, to a lesser extent, the acting. The result is a pseudo incest scene followed by a speech about escaping bourgeois life for a world of sensation and transgression that sort of justifies the continuance of the franchise.
Well, I'm not going to kid myself. This one was made just for me and the dozen other die hard HR fans out there. It's fallen a long way down from its heyday, which was pretty much the first film and maybe the third, but there is still something there. It's 2014 and we still suffer taboos, social inhibitions and general squeamishness and the point of HR is to hold a mirror up to our secret ugliness and wickedness. But this is America, and we really are about celebrating big big budgets. So lay a flower on the grave of the Hellraiser franchise. This may be the last halfway decent one...and look forward to that Avengers Age of Ultron. CGI and millions in special effects. I am SO excited (sarcasm intended).",1415145600,,1966,4.63323782234957
4592651,1,B0056P6SP0,"As someone who loved Hellraiser 1 thru 4, and thought the rest were o.k., I was really disappointed by this film.  It has some good Hellraiser elements, yet ultimately falls short.  Basically they took the plot from the first one and changed the story a bit, into a less cool story.

My biggest problem with the film was the actor they had playing Pinhead, he just totally took me out of the movie, making it hard to watch (and not in a good way). They didn't use any echo with his voice like they do for Doug Bradley, and worse yet the actor is a very stupid-looking guy with a huge underbite, and it looks even worse when he's in the make-up (he looks somewhat o.k. in real life).  If they make another Hellraiser, please use Doug Bradley, or at least an actor that doesn't look like a total goofball as that character.",1414627200,,821,4.34640522875817
4592652,3,B0056P6SP0,"I read the reviews posted here, and was prepared to hate this entry in the series. And while I had some pretty big issues with ""Revelations"", I was kind of surprised that I got into it despite the flaws.

As the film begins we see two friends, Steven and Nico, heading out for a weekend in Tijuana. We next see a series of quick scenes that the boys'  filmed in which they are getting plastered, meeting a girl in a bar, and finding out that there car has been stolen, and Nico solving the infamous puzzle box when Pinhead appears. We then flash to Steven's parents home a year later, and his parents are having a dinner party with Nico's parents. We learn that the boys' have been missing, and that the only thing recovered was the video camera, and a golden puzzle box. Steven's sister seems fascinated with puzzle box, and as she beings to solve it, Steven stumbles in, bloodied and dazed.

There are a lot of good things in ""Revelations"", there is some pretty decent gore, and for the first time since ""Hellbound"" we get a throwback to Barker's original story with someone sacrificing people in order to bring someone else back from Pinhead's realm. But there is a lot of horrible choices made by the filmmakers too. The inclusion of some horrible, palsy-like shaky-cam scenes in the beginning is headache inducing. I was really glad that the entire film wasn't ""found footage"", but there was more than enough for my taste.

But the ultimate sin is casting someone else as Pinhead. The iconic character has been used in every film, and until this one he was played by Doug Bradley. Bradley owns the character. Even in ""Inferno"" where Pinhead makes what's basically an extended cameo, the filmmakers mad sure it was Bradley behind the make-up. Here, in ""Revelations"", Pinhead is a central character, and he is horribly mis-cast. Not only is it not Doug Bradley, the person behind the pins is way too young, and the pinhead make-up looks cheap, maybe one step up from a Wal-Mart mask. Actually, none of the Cenobites looked too good, just some basic masks.

I think that if they had cast either Bradley or someone with better screen presence, this entry in the series would be way up the scale of favored sequels.",1413504000,,2215,4.625954198473282

It had to be released at a cinema, which it was, shown just once with no advertising, for cast & crew and free entry for anyone that 'knew' it was on and wandered in off the street.

It was afforded a budget of just $300k compared to the $5 million budget for the previous straight-to-video Hellraiser: Hellworld and Doug Bradley (aka Pinhead) chose not to participate due to the filming needing to start just a couple of weeks after first being contacted and no doubt being unable to meet his asking price. They never even intended for this movie to be released on DVD and only did it eventually because of the fuss kicked up by all the Hellraiser fans.

I can't believe Amazon Allows People who positively Never saw the movie to ruin it's reputation.
This was never released in theaters. Their was no way you could watch it until the disk was in your hand. Not fair.

I have a lot of love and a little hate for this movie. I will be honest it had flaws. But first lets go over all the positives.

1) Story was captivating and had a lot of good twists to add a wow factor. Story 4.5 Stars.
2) All the ""HUMAN"" Actors were very good in their roles. I honestly have never seen any of these actors before, but they came off seasoned rather than straight from acting 101. Acting 4 Stars.
3) Female version of Chatterer Cenobite - A great Bonus

Now here are the negatives.
Sadly No Doug Bradley. (Something All the Haters use to trash this movie)
But You Need to Realize that Doug Bradley Has Repeatedly Told Interviewers and fans HE was the one who turned down the Role when they told him the budget and time constraints of the production.
Sad also is because this was low budget, Pinhead Didn't look as cool. PinHead was actually acted by 2 actors (Kinda like Darth Vader only not as cool).
The Voice actor was honestly bad. I did not enjoy him speaking. The actor who was visually filmed was not bad though. His facial structure was great. The problem is The makeup was poorly done compared to when Doug Bradley was Brushed up. Also in previous films with Doug... when you looked at the PINS in his head you were always like ""How the hell did they get them so close."" But in this movie the pin application was poor and the pins were much farther apart than normal. But again Shoe string budget.

other negative were problems with the mythology and story of Hellraiser itself. The Basic Premise was great but they screwed up a few things.

First and biggest...It was established in the first 2 movies Someone could come back from the dead, but only if blood came into contact with the spot they died. (1st movie was the floor and 2nd was the mattress the woman died on.
In this movie someone comes back when blood is spilled in a totally different place then where they were taken by the cenobites. That's breaking the rules of the reality.

Second...Who ever was in control of the scenes where the puzzle box is used didn't know their stuff. the actors were not circling their fingers in the right direction and the puzzle box opened and closed before the cenobites even arrived...twice

Third...I won't spoil who it is...but one of the main characters kinda turns into a Pinhead Jr / Pinhead Lite
He was creepy and the idea was kinda cool but I wasn't totally sold on the idea.

Beside that overall this movie is great

Now considering this movie was rushed and made in like 2 weeks with only $300,000 dollars (Chump change in the movie biz)I Find this movie Deserves a Watch from every Hellraiser Fan or Fan of Good Horror.",1377475200,,3099,4.451499118165785

The production values are none, the movie looks like it was shot with a fun saver (which they actualy worked into the movie)

The human scripting was horrible, but the Cenobites did have a couple lines, and pretty good make up

It does try to harken back to the origional 2 with the creepy old guy, blood brings me back, betrayal, and so on.

It has a bit of a twist ending thats far better then what they gave to Christy Cotton at the end of Hellseeker.

I am not defending this movie, for what they had you can tell they tried to do their best. If it had a budget, and a couple more writers, there could have been something to the idea they had.

My advice would be think of it as a Blair Witch type of movie, pretend theres a janitor & 2 robots poking fun and look at it for what they wanted to do. It sucks a lot less that way

4592686,3,B0056P6SP0,"Hellraiser: Revelations follows the fates of two friends who discover a puzzle box that opens a gateway to a realm inhabited by sadomasochistic monsters known as the Cenobites.

The ninth entry to the Hellraiser franchise was actually made due to the fact that due to an obligation on Dimension Films' part to release another Hellraiser film or risk losing the rights to the franchise. Due to the quick turnaround time, series star Doug Bradley declined to participate, making this the first entry in the series in which he does not play Pinhead. It's also the first entry in the series since Hellraiser: Bloodline to be based on an original script, instead of incorporating series antagonist Pinhead into an unrelated horror story.

The film was shot over the course of three weeks in Los Angeles for Puzzlebox Films and, sadly, it shows. Too, without Bradley's presence as Pinhead in the film, H:R looks like a cheap knock-off of the series despite the fact that it is part of the series. Stephan Smith Collins does his best to be a foreboding presence as Pinhead(with Fred Tatasciore providing the voice) but doesn't quite make the mark.

Overall, though, Hellraiser: Revelations isn't as bad a movie as you'd expect it to be. Despite the time constraints in making the movie and the fact that it was made on a $300,000 budget; it was okay. Decent, even. One does wonder how it may have turned out if they had more time to plan, you know? There are far worse Hellraiser movies that have been released. I'm sure we all have our own pick. My pick would be Hellraiser: Deader. Even so, the General Public will probably pick this one due to the fact that Doug Bradley is absent from this movie.

One thing I do want to touch base on. Regardless of what you might think, Hellraiser: Revelations is not a reboot/remake of the series just because someone new is playing Pinhead. I'd like to think that Dimension Films(as well as The Weinstein Company) would back a reboot/remake with alot more money as well as put in well known actors/actresses(much like they did in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street). When they do decide to reboot/remake the series, you can dang well bet that Clive Barker will be involved and they will make it one 'hell' of a movie(no pun intended).",1364774400,,2308,4.719602977667494

Predictably he is unhappy with the results, but Steven ends up belonging more to the Pinhead school of thought than he expected. After Steven apparently returns home, the boys' families find themselves isolated in their desert house as the Cenobites return to reclaim a soul that has escaped them...

Revelations fails in basically every way it possible could. It is shot entirely in syfy channel wobbly cam, the music lacks all the dramatic oomph of the previous films, and the whole plot is rote and predictable to the point that nobody who has seen the earlier films will be surprised by any of it. The actors phone in every line, including whoever plays Pinhead (Doug Bradley wisely steered clear of this dookie). The result is a movie that is more camp than scary- Pinhead cuts a house's phone lines? Really? And the cenobites in general seem more like generic slasher movie baddies than the gothic archfiends they were in earlier installments.

I personally recommend stopping your Hellraiser viewing with 2, but even if you've stuck out the later installments, skip this drek. With performers who would be better off in wordless commercials, a rote plot, and forgettable everything, there is no reason to waste your time with this film.",1360022400,2,1798,4.888524590163934
4592690,1,B0056P6SP0,"HELLRAISER has always had a bad reputation when it comes to sequels, which typically tend to be more experimental than many other series. Well, HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS certainly doesn't look to change that. It follows two overprivileged teens that set off to Mexico for a week of debauchery, only to discover a mysterious puzzle box that is supposed to grant the furthest reaches of human ecstasy. At home, their parents try to forget the loss of their sons, when one returns to tell them about his escape from hell. As much as Horror fans like to deny it, their villainous heroes are past their prime, and are now distant memories. Who wants to see a sagging Pinhead in his late 50's still tormenting souls? Though few embrace the recent rash of remakes, this is the time to replace starring villains, not in pathetic sequels that make mockeries of the characters. It is not that Stephan Smith Collins is terrible in the role (although highly forgettable), but more the case that the film, itself, is abhorring to the senses. REVELATIONS comes desperately close to TROLL 2 in terms of unnatural dialog and wooden performances, which is a fate worse than death for any serious horror film. Though packed with gore, it is impossible to get past the idiotic characters and mind-numbing script. It comes as no surprise that the film was a rushed attempt for the Weinstein company to withhold the rights to the series, but what good is a title when you have destroyed its name? Worst in the series, by far.

4592693,1,B0056P6SP0,"Hellraiser: Revelations (Victor Garcia, 2011)

I've been having a little fun going through Dread Central's worst movies of 2011 lists and checking out the stuff that showed up on multiple lists. I was not nearly as disappointed with Creature as that lot were, but they were dead on the money with Hellraiser: Revelations, a movie so ridiculous that even Doug Bradley, who's been using the Hellraiser series as his primary income for decades, jumped ship.

It's a ridiculous rehash of the first film; they might well have done better to just call it a reboot and have done with it. But Garcia (Return to House on Haunted Hill) and screenwrtier Gary Tunnicliffe (Megalodon--but more worth noting is that he's been part of the SFX team on various Hellraiser films since the third, as well as Barker's own film Lord of Illusions) took the events of the first film and couched them in an inept mystery about the disappearance of two college-age friends in Mexico (who, of course, opened the box and summoned Pinhead, now played by Everything Must Go's Stephan Smith Collins, and his playmates--even including a new version of the chattering cenobite, now female).

And hey, Victor and Gary, can we talk about that? Because even in the crappiest Hellraiser sequels so far (which is, really, everything from the third movie on, and even the second really wasn't any great shakes), one of the very few things we looked forward to was at least some sort of inventiveness, creativity, irony, or even stupidity in the new cenobites that were sure to appear. And what did we get this time? [SPOILER ALERT!] A rehashed chatterer and ""Pseudo-Pinhead""? Come on, are you SERIOUS? [/SPOILER ALERT]

You are, I am sure, as painfully aware as I am that the inevitable reboot of the franchise is eventually coming. (IMDB says there's one in development, but no details are listed yet. Empire Online, terrifyingly, are strongly insinuating that Dimension is trying to make the movie franchise that has always pushed the hard_r boundary to its limits into a PG-13 franchise this go-round. But here's the question you have to mull over: is it even remotely possible that even a PG-13 remake could be worse than Hellraiser: Revelations? I dread the actual answer to this question, because the odds that the answer is ""yes"" are at leas a thousand to one... but they're not zero. How awful a concept is that?

4592698,2,B0056P6SP0,"This may be the first of the Hellraiser films to not feature Doug Bradley as pinhead, but that is not really what seems to plague Hellraiser Revelations so badly. Revelations seems less like a sequel and more of an attempt at a reboot, and as we know of most reboots, they don't always end up satisfying you.

What leads me to believe that this is more of a reboot is the similarity in loose plot points to the original film. In the original, we have a recently married woman not entirely happy with her fate after having slept with her husband's brother hours before the wedding. In Revelations its a pair of unhappy, spoiled teen best friends who decide that they need to escape.

The depth of Clive Barker's writing was said to have been barely hinted at in the original film, and having read the book I can believe that. And if the original Hellraiser film, largely celebrated as one of the greatest psychological terror fests even rendered on celluloid, was said to come up short in the way that most book to film adaptations usually do, what does it say about this botched reboot? Well, quite a bit actually.

Had you never experienced the original Hellraiser or knew of Pinhead and the Cenobites' existence, you might be inclined to look past the thin attempts at acting in Revelations and see a pretty decent horror film. It does have the Hellraiser series' gift of gore, but as we know, its not JUST the gore that makes for spending a good time with Pinhead and company.

The bonds of love and the joining of exquisite torment and absolute agony and all the metaphors within those confines are lost in Revelations and instead we have two teen boys and Pinhead going thru the motions, repeating similar lines from the original film, even trading skin just as in the original, with none of the visceral character development that made the original film such a riveting tale to watch unfold.

For example, it's just not as conceivable that a friend would kill to give blood to his friend who was trapped in the cenobytes' realm and now skinlessly returned. Not without some motivation, which Revelations gives us none of. In the original film, Julia would do ANYthing for Frank because of her love beyond lust for him. These two kids in Revelations....What's their story beyond needing to leave their suburban lives behind? We are told nothing more than a tale of infidelity between their parents (Hence the title 'Revelations') which SHOULD add up to resentment toward one another, not an unbreakable bond for no reason. In fact, properly exploring THAT path between the characters would have proved to be a much more believable plot.

Even the vagrant comes off as an incomplete character despite being given more attention than any of the other films ever did.

The problem is that Hellraiser is not just another mindless hack and slash film. It's supposed to be the thinking person's horror film, and that's what the makers of Revelations seem to have forgotten. They know the nuts and bolts of the gross moments of the original film, and they seem content on delivering only that.

In light of what's REALLY wrong with Revelations, Stephan Smith Collins playing a just adequate Pinhead is the last thing that should be focused on when filmmakers go to work on the next Hellraiser sequel. Bringing back the elements that make Hellraiser so enjoyable to watch is what's really needed for the future of the franchise. And that's no Revelation.

For the first 15 minutes of the film, we see it thru the eyes of a digital camera that one  actor uses to film him and his buddy going down to Tijuana, Mexico. The movie just goes downhill for the remainder of the film.  Most of the special effects occur after the camera turns away and then comes back to the scene.  I don't believe there are any CGI effects at all in this movie.  Pinhead (and not the original actor either) is a complete joke and hardly compares to Hellraiser I & II.

So... no Doug Bradley as Pinhead in this one.

Crap.

That right away turns me off. I don't like not having him in the iconic role of the lead cenobite. With that said... it took me a while to come to terms with Doug not being a part of this movie... so I didn't watch it.

Well, a few weeks ago I saw it was added to Netflix and I decided, ""ok, it's time I just get this painful thing over with""... and I added it to my queue.

I would choose EASTER SUNDAY to watch a horror movie (LOL).

The plot was extremely similar in many ways to the first Hellraiser movie. I don't want to give away the plot or any story aspects because in the Hellraiser series, the tiniest little bit of information usually makes the difference. Needless to say, I found nothing wrong with the plot in general. If anything, I was really pleased that the STORY was a sort of backtrack to the original format of what Hellraiser was.

The acting... some were VERY good actors... some, not so much. Jay Gillespie was ok. I had seen him before in the remake of 2001 Maniacs with Robert Englund. I liked him in that movie but I didn't much care for him in this one. He seems a little OFF his game. Nick Eversman as Steven was really the star of this whole movie. He could turn his character on a dime and in a Hellraiser movie, that's what is needed. I was VERY impressed with him. Everyone else, just filler in my opinion.

The cenobites looked awesome as usual... a female chatterer, a few other female cenobites, then we get to the NEW PINHEAD... Stephan Smith Collins. Well... he's no Doug Bradley. And I found myself rather BORED with his version of Pinhead. He wasn't as cool and smooth as Doug in the role. He didn't have that twisted demon presence either. However, I will say he stood tall... and looked the part (mostly due to great people doing great makeup) but otherwise, his Pinhead wouldn't last 2 seconds with Doug Bradley's Pinhead in any showdown.

Is this a good Hellraiser?

No.

Is it worth seeing?

Yes.

If you are a fan of the Hellraiser series and have seen all the Hellraisers so far, sitting through Revelations isn't going to hurt you one damn bit... in fact it might make you nostalgic for the first Hellraiser... and if you sat through DEADER and/or INFERNO.... you can stomach this one which is better than those two COMBINED.

Hellraiser Revelations isn't the BEST of the Hellraiser series but it isn't the worst...

it depends on what you're looking for.

4592710,3,B0056P6SP0,"While I'm not granting HELLRAISER: Revelations a pass, I do find it funny that Clive Barker released a public statement claiming this 9th movie in the franchise is ""NO F-ING CHILD OF MINE"" when I don't recall reading anything about his disappointment with the previous 4 or 5 movies.  Especially considering movies 5-8 were originally non-Hellraiser movies that were later re-written to include Pinhead, whereas this latest--and hopefully last in line--was actually written as a Hellraiser original.  I mean, it's crap, sure, and it lifts the plot from the first movie, but hey at least the Hellraiser connection doesn't feel as forced here.

Steven Craven (Nick Eversman, ""Missing"") and Nico Bradley (Jay Gillespie, 2001 MANIACS) are two privileged California teens off on an adventure.  And that means Tijuana!  The pair wind up stranded after their car is stolen, but they don't let that dampen their moods.  Instead they get wasted and pick up a hooker.  Through the course of a drunken night, however, the prostitute winds up dead, so Steven and Nico do what any red-blooded American rich kid would do: they go to a different bar.  It's here they meet a vagrant who promises them he can introduce them to experiences beyond the limits of anything they've known before.  He hands over a puzzle box, which the two take back to their room.  Nico, the more adventurous and boisterous of the two opens the box, and all Hell breaks loose.

For reals.

A year later, the boys' families have come to terms with the fact their sons are gone, but that doesn't mean they have to like it.  They get together for dinner one night in the Craven's mountain home, far from the city, and mourn their losses.  But the celebration is short-lived when Steven appears back on their doorstep.  Chaos reigns as the questions fly, but what it comes down to is Nico isn't with him.  Wherever they were, Steven has escaped and is afraid the ones holding them captive are going to come for him.  They try to call an ambulance, even though the blood on Steven isn't his and he doesn't appear to be injured, but phone is out.  They try to transport him to the hospital in the car, but the cars are gone, too.  They suspect foul play.

Through flashbacks we find out Nico was taken by the Cenobites after opening the box, but that after Steven killed a hooker in his room, Nico used her blood to help him return, a la Frank Cotton from the original HELLRAISER.  Nico enlisted Steven's aid in killing more Mexican prostitutes in order to be whole again.  But at the critical moment when Nico only needs one more body, Steven chickens out and his skinless friend is left to take matters into his own hands.  Nico needs skin, Steven won't help him get it.  Which means Steven is now useless to Nico.  And Steven's also got all that nice skin.  See where I'm going?

Luckily that explains the scene where Steven made out with his sister Emma--Nico's girlfriend.

HELLRAISER: Revelations is 75 minutes of lame, unoriginal story, bad acting and disappointment.  But Dimension films was in danger of losing the rights to the franchise, so they had to do something quick.  Do something quick meant spend $300,000 on a 3-week production (including 11 days of filming) and further alienating an already dwindling fanbase by going ahead with the movie sans series regular Doug Bradley who refused to star after reading the script.  Considering the last few Hellraiser movies Bradley HAS taken part in, that's saying something.

Instead of the one recognizable figure in the entire Hellraiser canon, the makers cast Chicago native Stephan Smith Collins who, before Hellraiser had starred in nothing any of you have seen and since Hellraiser has been in an episode of ""Castle"" and ""NCIS: Los Angeles"" as Salesperson.  Collins is tall and bald.  That's pretty much the criteria I'm assuming is needed for being Pinhead.  Nevermind he otherwise looks nothing like Pinhead, even with the grey skin and a head full of pins.  And nothing against Collins but, even as bad as this movie was, I believe Bradley's presence would have lent it some small amount of respectability.  Instead the whole thing, from stolen plot to bad imitation of staple villain, comes across as a parody.

On the other hand, the story gets back to what Hellraiser was about in the first place.  The thing that was missing from the previous 4 movies was a sense that the Cenobites could be a threat.  Sure, they were IN Hellraisers 5-8, but those stories weren't about the Cenobites, they were stories about humans doing bad things to each other, and those things eventually just led to the Cenobites.  But the Cenobites, and Pinhead in particular, were never the source of the main conflict in those movies.  So while I can't give the movie credit for being GOOD, I can at least respect it for being a Hellraiser movie.

The story and script were written by Gary J. Tunnicliffe who has written a few other things as well but is more commonly known as a make-up effects man, having worked on just about everything from several HALLOWEEN movies to PROPHECY movies to HELLRAISER movies to FEAST movies to PULSE movies to WOLVERINE and MY BLOODY VALENTINE and SCREAM 4 and APOLLO 18.  So the man obviously knows his way around a horror movie.  That doesn't necessarily mean he should be in charge of penning the franchise's last gasp, but that wasn't my call.  He also worked the make-up effects for the movie, and those were awesome, especially the Stephen-Cenobite (whoops, did I reveal too much?).

The director was Victor Garcia, who seems to be building a career on straight-to-DVD horror sequels to franchises few people cared about in the first place, like RETURN TO HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and MIRRORS 2.  I can't vouch for his work on those movies, but I can say on this one, I've seen worse.  I think he was able to piece together a very coherent story in just 75 minutes by using his time wisely and not lingering on unimportant details.  I think his actors were terrible and the script was stiff, but I admire Garcia's sensibilities in getting the story across in as simple a way as possible.

However none of this excuses the fact this is a bad movie.  I know Dimension's back was against the wall and they were working against a very tight deadline, but holy crap, man.  This was their best effort?  At the same time, they turned out an original--well, technically original--Hellraiser movie in 3 weeks, something the previous 4 movies couldn't do on much more lenient schedules.  Which says to me Hellraisers 5-8 were just plain lazy.

With any luck, HELLRAISER: Revelations is the END of this franchise.  Amid talk of a remake, I think this current incarnation has more than run its course, so if this is to be the last one, I think they went out the right way.  I just think they could have went out the righter way with Doug Bradley on board.  In movies like Halloween and Friday the 13th, even the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series, it's ok to swap out actors for the lead slasher role, but Doug Bradley IS the face of the Hellraiser franchise--so to put a face on the DVD cover that is very obviously NOT Doug  Bradley's, that's just plain bad marketing and a sure way to guarantee NO ONE will see this thing out of anything other than morbid curiosity.

The bozo who plays Pinhead looks more like an ugly nailhead skinhead. Couldn't they find any pins? Maybe they should of used toothpicks. The movie has no purpose as it jumps around trying to create fear and tension and a few stupid lines.

4592717,1,B0056P6SP0,"Coming off the heels of past direct-to-video disappointments like ""Deader"" and ""Hellworld"" -- movies which are assuredly every bit as stupid as their titles suggest -- one would think the ""Hellraiser"" franchise could not sink any lower.

One would be wrong.

Enter ""Hellraiser: Revelations,"" the ninth installment in the ""Hellraiser"" series and first in over half a decade. Produced in a matter of weeks and on a shoe-string budget, ""Revelations"" is essentially a place-holder produced by your good friends at The Weinstein Company in order to retain rights to the franchise while an inevitable remake rots in development Hell. Absolutely minimal thought and care were put into this ""film,"" as each and every frame oozes with idiocy and contempt for its audience.

The plot, while admittedly less convoluted than the past four or so ""Hellraiser"" films, attempts to align itself with the original and in the process fails miserably. Two pseudo-rebellious teens head to Mexico to indulge in a bit of decadence but get more than they bargained for upon stumbling upon the mysterious and ubiquitous puzzle box. That thing just shows up anywhere, huh? When one of the buddies returns home, he brings home tales of macabre madness and a few cenobites on his tail as well. Can his family survive having their souls torn apart? Will Pinhead get what he wants? Is Tijuana really that dirty? Do you really care?

Admittedly, the film may have been a bit easier to swallow had they hired actual actors to portray the characters on film. Make no mistake, the film is still ridiculous and embarrassing, but for the most part, it's amateur-hour here, with one actor inexplicably slipping in and out of a Scottish accent. It's a well-known fact that Doug Bradley, who stuck with the character of Pinhead throughout the thick and thin of eight films, was re-cast for the film, partially due to time/budget constraints, but more likely due to the actor having a spine and deciding that enough is enough. His presence is most certainly missed, though he probably couldn't have saved the film anyway. His replacement, whose name isn't even worth looking up, appears to be playing a parody of the character and has neither the screen-presence nor the chops to fill his predecessor's shoes. Heck, they even got the guy who played Handbanana on ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" to do voice-over work for the poor schlub.

It's sad to say, but ""Hellraiser: Revelations"" never really stood a chance. Even sadder is that it makes a long-line of dim sequels look like masterpieces by comparison. Like the recent ""Children of the Corn: Genesis"" -- produced under the same conditions and for the same reasons -- this one would have been better left buried. Should we look forward to the remake? Well, if the Weinsteins are involved, that's a big fat ""no."" Get Clive Barker back, get somebody behind the film that actually cares and maybe then Pinhead and his merry band of cenobites can raise Hell again. As for this installment, two infamous words from the first film come to mind: Jesus wept.",1333324800,34,3058,4.9186046511627906

4592723,1,B0056P6SP0,"The Hellraiser movie series used to be one of my favorite franchises. The story-lines, the shadowy cinematography, the costume designs, and the bloody special effects were some of the elements that engaged me perfectly. The entertaining atmosphere of the films was a combination of fear, horror, and erotica, and it kept on working for me.

Until Hellraiser: Revelations put the final nail in the coffin that Deader and Hellworld had lined up for the franchise.

Synopsis:
A couple of guys, Steven and Nico,  run off to Tijuana because they're bored with their pampered lives and want to go see a donkey show. They decide to bring a camera along to film the events. Luckily, this isn't one of those amateur camcorder movies, although it does seem like it through the first few minutes of the movie. If you're like me and get a headache from such movies, bear with it.

While in Tijuana, they meet a homeless guy who gives them our old friend, the Lament Configuration. Upon opening it, and thanks to amateur camcorder footage, we see a very portly Pinhead come on-screen. We then learn that we've been watching a video with Steven's mother on the camcorder it was shot on, and the boys have disappeared.

Luckily, the box came with the video camera in Steven's bag, and his not so little sister, Emma, opens it briefly, apparently just long enough for Steven to get out. Or did he? All is revealed as Steven's parents and Nico's parents get together for a missing-persons anniversary full of pain and drama that most of us Hellraiser fans would like to forget.

Let us start with what was good about this movie:

1) Tracey Fairaway as Emma Craven was some decent eye candy in this mess of a movie. While the incestuous plot device with her brother Steven was an odd nod to the morbid sexiness between Frank and Julia in the original Hellraiser, it didn't seem overly forced. This helped give Revelations a ""feast of flesh"" theme that could have been so much more, if it wasn't so brief and haphazard.

2) Trace Fairaway as Emma Craven was the only decent thing about this movie, enough to say it again.

Now for the bad:

1) Fat Pinhead, played by Stephan Smith Collins, seemed to be a caricature of Doug Bradley's Pinhead. With a $300,000 production budget and quick filming, this casting was destined to be doomed without Bradley, but to find such a polar opposite was ridiculous.

2) Pinhead Jr. just added to the caricature of the whole movie. To give it credit, the way Pinhead Jr. was created seemed plausible: he lost his skin, and wanted it back. Fat Pinhead nailed his flesh to his face: mission accomplished. The problem is that even that slim, sensible horror is lost, because there has already been a Pinhead. It was always interesting to see the way new cenobites were created from their own vices, even if it was a walking CD player with a head. This time around, I felt cheated.

3) The story-line was muddled, at best, throwing in random lust scenarios into a top-heavy lust scenario that had already been done repeatedly in the series. This time, it was done the worst ever. Add the randomness of Steven's return (*SPOILER* How did he get captured by the cenobites the second time? Or, did he coincidentally show up when Emma opens the box?), a ""tell-all"" reason to why Nico is such an ass at the end that was a throwaway theme, and an open ending that makes us fear for the sequel, and we are given the most nonsensical Hellraiser story ever created.

4) Death by getting your face peeled all seems boring the third time it is done...in the same movie.

5) Nothing is revealed, except the idea that The Weinstein Company rushed this movie through so that their rights to the franchise wouldn't expire.

After this mess of a movie, I welcome the Hellraiser remake, and that is not something I ever say lightly.

I give this movie 1 out of 5 Pinhead face-palms. Even if the film is for free on-demand, don't bother. It's better to think this film had never been born.",1324425600,4,3983,4.620396600566572
4592724,5,B0056P6SP0,"As a horror fan, and a big one at that, I was definitely pessimistic about seeing someone other than Doug Bradley play Pinhead.

In fact, this is so much better than any of the garbage Rick Bota directed (HELLSEEKER, DEADER, HELLWORLD) that I'm surprised at the fan reaction. This one actually bothers to take the HELLRAISER mythology seriously and to me, it seems like a return to form.  The make-up and gore effects actually manage to be above average.  The musical score is at times reminscent of the original.  The two lead actors,  Nick Eversman and Jay Gillespie are generally pretty good.  The lighting design for the Cenobite sequences looks quite authentic.  The film retains the mood of the original HELLRAISER films and there are several clever nods to the original in this one.  Of course the elephant in the room is the lack of Doug Bradly as Pinhead.  He is replaced by Stephan Smith Collins (although apparently this isn't his voice in the film - Pinhead is voiced by Fred Tatasciore) and he fills the horror icons shoes much better than Jackie Earl Haley in the awful NIGHTMARE remake or the guy (whose name escapes me) who did Jason in the equally awful FRIDAY remake.  In fact I would say that this new HELLRAISER film is far better than the average horror remake coming out these days.  With all of the good stuff said, there are plenty of flaws in this film.  How long can someone survive a gunshot wound to the gut?  Apparently quite a long time as Steven Brand (who inexplicably gets top billing in this thing) spends nearly half the film with his guts hanging out.  Why are the mothers and sister of the two lead boys dressed as prostitutes?  Why didn't they hire someone to play the Vagabond character who could act?  Honestly the film isn't a total trainwreck but it certainly will not do anything to improve the reputation of this franchise that has suffered so badly since it fell into the paws of the Weinsteins who of course could care less about the quality of anything they produce as long as they can make money from it (and the fact that they have flushed their entire fortune down the toilet more than once only to remake it with a lucky break dosen't say much for them). And who can blame them for wanting money...but they are not interested in film ... they are merely business men and this is what happens to a cool little independent series when the business guys are in complete control of it.  This isn't the worst of the bunch by a long shot, DEADER deserves that spot followed closely by HELLWORLD. It is a film that could have been great if it were not so handicapped by budget and time constraints.",1320192000,11,2707,4.539094650205762

I admire the fact that they keep cranking out the Hellraiser movies and still haven't resorted to the inevitable PG-13 Remake of Part 1.  With the drought of Halloween movies out there I had a lot of fun with this one.  These other reviewers had me thinking it had really bad acting and a boring story.  What were they expecting?! Hellraiser Part 1 or 2?!  This is part 9 and a whole lot of fun with the Cenobites.  The special effects are done nicely, I found no serious problems with the acting.  In a world of movies with clicke one-liners this movie (after you get fast the first 10 minutes...that did have a few one liners) there aren't any.  The story was cool for a Part 9 and it held me to the end.  I don't know if these other reviewers saw the title and thought this was gonna be some kinda ""Tree of Life"" with Cenobites.  But, take the title Relavations with a grain of salt and get ready to go to the nightmare world of the Cenobites.  These Cenobites are totally the kind of Horror Icons you don't mess with.  Someone in this one tries to shoot one with a gun.  You gotta watch this movie to see what happens.  My recommendation: if you are looking for a cool Halloween weekend new release movie...rent this one.  Personally, I don't buy movies much cause I usually watch them one time and move one (there are so many movies to watch).  I gave this movie 4 stars cause I had a blast watching it.  I hold the 5 star rating for the rare movie that I'll watch twice films like: Metropolis (Giorgio Moroder Remixed), El Topo, Toy Story 3, Once Upon a Time in the West, Stroyzek, Kill Bill, House by the Cemetary just giving examples.  It being October 2011 and a serious drought of new horror movies check this one out.  This is a worthy entry to the Hellraiser Franchise.  Yeah, one thing I gotta say about the new Pinhead.  No offense to anyone.  There is a different actor and I am a huge Erasure fan.  I was watching this one with one of my friends and she loves the band Erasure too.  I was thinking it and then, she said Pinhead looks a lot like Andy Bell (the lead singer of Erasure).  He kinda has a glam pop look to him and looks a little cuter than usual but, I got used to it after about five minutes and he transformed to a menacing Pinhead.

4592737,3,B0056P6SP0,"Is this a great film?  No.  Is it a good film?  Not really.  The new Pinhead sounds and looks a bit ridiculous - looks like Pinhead has been hitting quite a few buffets since he was last seen.  I would've preferred a Cenobite-centric film without Pinhead.  If Pseudo-Pinhead is going to be created, fine but don't have the supposedly real Pinhead there as well (unless Doug Bradley is going to agree to be in it).
That all being said, maybe it's because of all the talk of this being one of the worst films ever made, I didn't think it was terrible.  It had its moments (borrows a lot from the original Hellraiser, which allows you to see the surprise ending well before it comes).  Maybe it's due to expectations, but I still think Hellraiser 3 is the worst of the lot.  They do all right with their non-existant budget.  Acting is not Oscar worthy but it's not as bad as the wooden performances you get from someone like Keanu Reeves.
I'm rounding up to 3 stars, even though I'd say it's more of a 2.5.  It's OK (3 stars), but I really didn't like the portrayal of Pinhead (decreases to 2 stars).  It's probably because of Doug Bradley's great performances etched in my brain, but, looking solely at this film as a separate entity, I still did not care much for Pinhead's portrayal - his voice often came off as if he may be from Tennessee...I don't know - lost something for me.",1319760000,3,1381,4.393700787401575

4592739,3,B0056P6SP0,"Ok first off I just want to say the majority of the reviews on here are by people that have not even seen the film. Yes Doug Bradly is not in this and yes the budget is very very small. These two things have seriously hampered a very good script. 2nd thing is that I was well aware of the controversy with this movie before I got involved in this, so I went it expecting a trainwreck. Watching this movie was very frustrating because it really is the best hellraiser story in years(not counting the recent comic books from BOOM. Major props to Gary Tunniclife for doing double duty as the makeup effects designer and writer. It really is amazing that it looks as good as it does considering it was such a rushed production. The new Pinhead is difficult to judge because for one thing his voice has been dubbed over. The biggest problem with the new guy is his facial structure. Many of people have called him fat or chubby but thats not really the case. He just has a very strong jaw that does not fit Pinhead at all, not to mention that he is very baby faced. The biggest problem with this movie is not in the cast and crew who I think did the best that they could do under the circumstances, the problem really is with the weinstein company. I truly hate the weinsteins with a passion, they have been sitting on this franchise for years insulting the true fans by pushing out DTV drivel every few years and milking it for all its worth. The sad thing is that in previous years they would take already existing scripts and then convert them into hellraiser scripts by sprinkling pinhead at random points. Bottomline, best hellraiser script in years and I hate to say it but I really enjoyed this movie more than the last 3. Its worth a watch.",1319414400,,1743,4.366153846153846
4592740,2,B0056P6SP0,"Capitalizing on bad movies, the film opens up with the annoying hand held camera as 2 young males (Nick Eversman and Jay Gillespie) head to Mexico in hopes of a sexual encounter. The next thing you know their car is jacked, then they are opening the puzzle box. Pinhead appears. Now I understand real people age and in hell they don't so they needed another pinhead. But if you are going to have someone speak monotone lines and sound odious, you must use voice enhancements, like they do in low budget films. There are times when both guys are being filmed at the same time and you have to ask why is the camera still jerking around? Now I can't remember the last Hellraiser I saw, was it the corporate one or the thing in outer space...or was that a Jason thing? And apparently it doesn't matter how it ties into the other films in the series.

The two boys have disappeared and the sister/gf (Tracey Fairaway) is extremely interested in what happened. 10 minutes into the film I was thinking, they are going to need some good nudity to save this one, and with the first hooker still having her clothes on, I didn't hope for much. Then there are some plot points I am confused about. We see Pinhead take the puzzle box, but it appears in the boy's room in his bag along with the camera they had when they went missing. How did this get back to his room from Mexico? The police saw the movie on the camera, but didn't keep it for evidence.

The puzzle box is not really a puzzle as everyone seems to be able to open it. It opened once by pushing the top, a second time by twisting the corner. Could we have a little consistency? And doesn't Tracey Fairaway take showers?  The vagrant (Daniel Buran) had some of the best lines, which to say were not that great. Nick Eversman as Steven was very weak and unconvincing as one of the main characters.

The movie breaks down into a bad home invasion film with a Hellraiser background. The poor ending hints at a squeal.

Then I was asking what the heck were they thinking here. First of all this cheap so called pinhead look alike and the actor portraying this icon was absolutly horrible in every way. Not only did the appearance look bad but,you gotta be kidding me with the voice. My 3 yr old neice can sound more evil than that. Where was Doug Bradley? He was badly needed to help this disaster out. The acting was terible, The story line was something a 5th grade child could have come up with. This film was an embarassment to the Hellrasier collection. Dont waste your money folks,its horrible.

Second they hard on the fact that it was made just to maintain the rights to the franchise... whats wrong with that? They wanted to keep it... so what...

If they wanna attack movies, why don't they attack the last 4? This was leagues better than those.

4592743,2,B0056P6SP0,"I ordered Revelations because I am a huge fan of the Hellraiser movies, and I was very curious to see how the new Pinhead compares to Doug Bradley. As I suspected there is no comparison. There is only one Pinhead, and Mr. Bradley is it. The movie itself was not very original. When Pinhead first appeared and spoke, I was let down right away. If Doug Bradley can not play the part anymore, then find someone who looks and has the same type of voice as him. This is a tall order to fill, but I am sure there is someone out there that can bring Pinhead back to true form. Hellraisers 1,2, and 3 are my favorites. All are very original with Clive Barker at his best. As for the Pinhead character, Doug Bradley is the king.",1319328000,2,719,4.217391304347826
4592744,1,B0056P6SP0,"I watched this with a date last night and yeah, it's a crappy movie.  Every bit as bad as the people who haven't seen it make it out to be.  True-- there's gore, there's chains, there's hooks.  In fact, there's all the sort of nastiness you might expect from a Hellraiser movie, but that's where the similarities end (at least when we're talking about the first two films and not the extruded sequel product of recent years).

This movie isn't going to win any awards, not for special effects, especially not for... well, anything else.  The acting is bad, the script is terrible.  I disagree with the reviewer who said that the new Pinhead at least delivers his lines in a Bradley-esque way-- Doug Bradley was never so wooden as Pinhead.  Pinhead is a lot of voice acting since the character is otherwise so stoic and calm and controlled-- the actor they have in Bradley's place, did, in my opinion, a very poor job.  I will always think of Freddy as Robert Englund, but at least the replacement actor in the most recent Elm St. film looked and sounded kinda/sorta right.  This Pinhead was off.  Way off.

This is a watch it if you must because you love the Hellraiser franchise kind of film.  If you can take or leave most sequels, don't waste your time with this.",1319068800,31,1266,4.504385964912281
4592745,1,B0056P6SP0,"Hellraiser movies are hit or miss. The First two are true horror classics. The sequels that follow range from pretty good to astonishingly awful.  Hellraiser revelations may take the seat held by ""Hellworld"" as the worst of the series.

They did try to at least go by the original rules of the Hellraiser films. The box, chains, cenobites, skin ripping/ wearing and abundant use of the words ""flesh"" and ""pleasure"". Sounds ok right?

Unfortunately, the movie is so low budget and characters sooooo bad that it doesn't even feel like a hellraiser movie. The acting is as bad as anything i've ever seen. Ever.  No one is good, no character motivations make sense at all. And to cover how cheap this movie is, they have the characters try and explain why there are only 3 sets and 10 actors in the movie. At least they made the ""Mexico"" scenes seem authentic HAHA

They didn't use ANY of the original hellraiser muisc, which seems ridiculous. If you can afford to use all the Hellraiser lore and Pinhead.  They don't come thru the walls, they just appear in the room. Any usually deep yet terrifying words by Pinhead are replaced by generic dribble.

Some of the gore is pretty good, and they didn't ruin Pinhead or the cenobites worse than anyone else has, but just about everything in this movie is just so stupid that even seeing a few chains, the box and a Fuax Pinhead barely nudge this to 1 star.",1318982400,35,1399,4.572
4592746,3,B0056P6SP0,"I'm not a horror movie hypocrite. I'll watch a horror movie so  if I hate it, i'll know why it sucked rather then saying because it's a remake. I'll admit some remakes are awful but their are a few i've enjoyed. Doug Bradley is Pinhead just like Robert Englund is Freddy. When I saw this movie coming I knew people would be hating on it.

Two college buddies go to Mexico to party and find Pinhead instead. They disappear but the camera of there adventure ends up at one of there familys home and one kid just shows up out of nowhere. Surprisingly the gore and Cenobites actually look really good in this movie. However, Pinhead is no Jackie Earle Haley and looks like some guy dressing up for Halloween. He looks like some comedian but I cant think of his name. He does deliver his lines in the vein of Doug Bradley, so that was nice.

Overall, not a bad film at all. It's an hour and fifteen minutes so it goes by quick. The speical effects and gore are done really well. I enjoyed it but it's no way near as good as the originals. I just think of it as a tribute rather then another in the series. Wheter you choose to see it or not is totally up to you. If Red Box had it for a dollar, i'd check it out.",1318982400,2,1207,4.1059322033898304

4592748,1,B0056P6SP0,"Now, will you take my opinion with a grain of salt because I will right off the bat declare myself a Hellraiser fanboy? Probably. I'm just getting that out of the way for you. I love the first seven entries in the series and this film actually makes the 8th look tolerable.

It's been well documented, that the Hellraiser series has been declining since the Marques de Sade-esque 4th film, ""Bloodline"". However, both 5 and 6 to me were highly enjoyable even if they weren't originally Hellraiser scripts. This is most likely due to Bradleys performances, as they are the one consistent (ti'll now) of the films. However, I think that is enough about the past......

You could say that the reason this film is terrible, is simply because it was rushed and filmed with a small budget and a short time period. In fact, that would be a pretty good reason. However, look at ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or the first ""Saw"" film. Both rushed and under budget and those have reached their own high level of respect in the genre. So lets face it, the script is poor, the actors make no connection with their audience and faux Pinhead is an insult to the brilliant mind of Clive Barker and the acting of Doug Bradley.

Clive and Doug had a working relationship in acting/play wright troupes throughout their younger years, they understood each other and more importantly their craft. That is what makes the film/icon stand the test of time. The characters were believably flawed. This is relevant to the review for the 9th entry in the Hellraiser saga because this film represents none of that. This was a rush job to keep the rites to the film for a longer time. Those involved in this film could care less about the legacy of this film or its fan base. To rise from the ruin that has been the last ten years for this series, you need to go back to the root values and emotions that it invoked in its audience.

Plus, the lead cenobite was always played with this high sense of arrogance, knowledge and a pitiful look at people and their lack of understanding when it came to pleasure and suffering. The character who portrays Pinhead here doesn't seem to take this into the role and treats it as you would some average sociopath. This throws the story off the axis that is the Hellraiser world. Not only that but the acting is so poor in this film, it makes the last few entries look award winning in fact. You'd think actors would be well versed and knowledgable on a series if they were entering it into the 9th film, yet this doesn't appear to be the case.

To sum it up, this is a rush job of a film which takes the modern day/cliche take on horror of teenagers acting stupid and finding trouble, with a poor excuse for something that may have once been a genius idea from the twisted mind of Clive Barker. i respect everything Barker has done but signing his rites away to the film so early on in the series just sucks in the most face palm of ways. This movie is an all too good example of such. Maybe, there would be a writer, director and set of actors who could make at the least a respectable Hellraiser film without the titans of the first film but I can say with all the confidence in the world that NONODY involved in this film are those people.",1318809600,2,3247,4.432160804020101
