8574046,5,B00BUELIQU,"If you are not totally blind perhaps you could have seen the title [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom ].
It perfectly states that, since it's an import, you would need a region free device to play it.

I bought a copy from Amazon UK and I have no problem watching these DVD's in my blueray so, buy with confidence if you own a region free DVD player.

About the TV show, this is not the best season and it gets a little bit boring but I bought it just to have the entire collection.
The video and sound quality is good, don't expect the same quality that can be found in a newer dvd.

Hope this is more useful.",1381708800,,629,4.056451612903226
