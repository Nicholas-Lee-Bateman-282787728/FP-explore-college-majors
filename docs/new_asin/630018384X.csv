225776,5,630018384X,"...this is a hilarious movie! The part where the apartment blows stuff out the window to the pool from somebody  putting an unmentionable in the microwave, or the part where the kids break down the wall to make more room for the party! ...great movie check it out!",1015891200,2,264,4.5
225777,5,630018384X,"I have always thought this movie got a bad rap from critics...I think it is hilarious and I have watched it probably 25 times....
It is no ""fast times"" but still a classic......",975283200,2,177,4.393939393939394
225865,5,630018384X,"it's crazy that iv'e seen idiotic movies like ghoulies on dvd and a great 80's movie with such a huge cast like eric stolzt, lea thompson, chris penn and many more , is not yet been released on dvd. they did the same thing with zapped, waited for ever to release it. come on!!!!! it's time.",1230422400,2,290,4.196428571428571
225866,4,630018384X,"I watched this on cable a few nites ago and wondered why it wasn't released on DVD. It deserves it. Even tried to find the soundtrack of the film but only on cassette. The shocking thing of th film was the sondtrack by Eddie Van Halen...if u watch the first 15 minutes or so you can hear 2 songs from VH ..""Right Now"" and ""How Do I know When Its Love"" intros.....and those songs came out years later!!!!!",1181692800,5,404,4.1923076923076925
225867,5,630018384X,It would be a tribute to the late Chris Penn to release this classic film on DVD. If not...it's casual.,1147996800,18,103,4.2
225868,4,630018384X,"In high school, I watched this movie every time it was on and it is still entertaining 22 years later. People assume this is a ""sequel"" To Fast Times At Ridgemont High. It was written by Cameron Crowe (who wrote Fast Times) and stars Chris Penn (Sean's brother). It was directed by Art Linson (who produced Fast Times) but it IS its own film. I like to think of it as a companion movie to Fast Times. What happens immediately AFTER high school? The Wild Life tackles that question and does a great job at it. The character of Jim (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) was me in high school. I was 15 when the Wild Life came out, so Jim was the character that I could relate to the most. I lived with my single mom and sister. I was obsessed with Vietnam (and WW2). I also wore camouflage pants to school about 3 days a week, hated authority figures and hung out in a bowling alley (as well as the mall arcade). The other characters are also interesting as well, but Jim was just the one that ""clicked"" with me. I assume Cameron Crowe based these people on real life versions just like he did with his Fast Times script and chances are, you will relate to someone in this film. I have always liked Eric Stoltz and in this he plays the straight guy to Chris Penn's obnoxious character. They work well together, but it's a friendship of necessity not choice. This is a much more serious film than Fast Times but still has some great, funny moments. Cool soundtrack with ORIGINAL songs by Bananarama and Eddie Van Halen. Release a dvd Universal. Don't underestimate the fan base for this film! A whole generation watched The Wild Life on cable over and over again. Release this movie ASAP as my VHS tape is getting haggard.",1144195200,13,1703,4.40952380952381
225869,4,630018384X,"expectations were high when the young progidy cameron crowe who recently wrote fast times at ridgemount high penned an instant classic that will hold time for generations to come.

when it came time for his follow up steering ever so close to the same genre  of teen bases sex,drugs and rock and roll fables of disanchanted youth cameron still hits the mark.it was never as sucsessful as fast times and is yet to be issued to dvd but this is a fantastic teen movie..all the basics are covered for a teenager with raging hormones and a thirst to question authority.

eric stoltz plays the newly high school graduate looking to move up in the world.

leah thompson plays his on and off girlfriend who is being basically date raped by a member of the l.a.p.d.

jenny wright plays the girlfriend of the buff comic who stars in this jem chris penn.

chris penn looking mean and lean is superb taking cue from his brother sean and even had his own catch phrase""its casual"" although the role was directly related to a jeff spicoli chris pulls it off fine.

rick moranis makes a great appearance as jenny writes geek 80's store mgr of lame clothes

and the dark haired kid from wierd science unfortunately i cant recall his name plays the rebelious younger brother of eric stoltz..buy the way this kid is fixated on vietnam and likes to blow stuff up.he even has a heroin addicted vietnam vet dramatically well played by randy quaid.

finally two things that put this flick over the top into celluliod greatness forever...rolling stones guitar player ronnie wood crashes through a wall in a final party scene and runs into a neibors refrigerater and comes out with a huge turkey drumstic.he is actually credited with the title ron wood...refrigerater raider and front man for the punk rock group lee ving as the cable repairman who came and never left.

dont let me forget the soundtrack,ill just say its good and most of the music throughout the soundtrack fm radio woudnt dare play in 84-85..way too scary

folks i just layed it all out for ya,if i were you id start a petition to get this thing converted to dvd right away.

its not fast times at ridgemount high..but it is a damn good teen comedy..this is the wild life",1140739200,2,2215,4.608142493638677
225870,5,630018384X,"I love The WILD LIFE [ Chris Penn] And I have it on LASERDISC,,'Tis a great Comedy and A Must See :P",1120953600,2,100,3.590909090909091
225871,4,630018384X,"Great 80's film, though it is preposterous to compare it to American Graffiti or Fast Times.  It's got it's share of miscues, but the frenetic pacing, the hot chicks, kick-arse soundtrack, the inevitable all-out party and a few pleasantly poignant suprises make it worth a look.

I was especially impressed with Ilan Mitchell Smith's performance as the troubled youth obsessed with the Vietnam Era.  He was simply the coolest, totally the highlight of the film.  It's too bad he kind of fizzled after the 80s, because he was a very talented actor.  I wonder if his uniquely juvenile voice kept him out of the adult roles?",1111708800,2,621,4.820754716981132
225872,3,630018384X,"A film forgotten amongst the pile of teen 80's fair, I thought this film notable for the big screen performance by one of classic strip-tease's most well-endowed performers.  Hey, it wouldn't be an indulgent 'Ridgement High' style flick without a little skin, and Natividad certainly has the merchandise to sell even this script.  Or maybe I am being too harsh?  To be sure, this film sports some stars, like Stoltz and Quaid, and there are some funny moments.  I admit that when I was an 80's teen and saw this movie, I sometimes identified, especially with the 'Nam-fixated younger brother.  But as an adult, I seem to have lost my taste for such sophomoric hijinx.  Really, this kind of film was done better.  If you're gonna see it, see it for the strip club scene.  That's about all I remember it for after all these years anyway.",1076544000,2,835,4.63265306122449
225873,3,630018384X,"First off, this movie is compared to ""Fast Times..."" for a major reason that other reviewers have not mentioned.  The script was penned by Cameron Crowe, the same writer.  Yes, this is the same Crowe who has written and directed ""Jerry Maguire,"" and ""Almost Famous.""  His most recent work (at this time) was directing ""Vanilla Sky"", though he did not write it.  That is where the similarities end.  This movie is like fast times in its exploration of teen themes in the early 80's.  Yes Chris Penn is Sean Penn's brother, and yes Eric Stoltz can be seen in both films.  This movie is not as good as ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""  It is funny and I like it, but the intended catch phrase ""It's casual"" falls flat.  Why is Ilan Mitchell Smith obsessed with all this military stuff?  I know the youthful angst answer to that, but was it supposed to lend some emotional weight to an otherwise goofball comedy?  If not, Randy Quaid's cameo exsists for no real reason.  It really doesn't belong in the film. Check this out if you like 80's teen flicks, but don't expect to uncover a hidden jem.  Yes, there good moments, but it does not hold up to the John Hughes standards for the era.  As I said, I do like it overall, but mainly for nostalgia's sake.",1018137600,7,1249,4.4449339207048455
7805112,4,630018384X,"Fun to see this movie again, and to actually own a VHS copy just like the one I would rent time and again from the local 7-Eleven back in the mid 1980s and watch on an old two-head VCR. This one is a great video with clarity and an unexpected depth that I can see on my dual DVD & 4-head VCR player/recorder. The performances are fun, and it is wonderful to see the late, great Chris Penn in one of his prime roles. I miss seeing him nowadays!",1406764800,,443,3.9887640449438204
7805113,5,630018384X,"Although this movie is a classic, I agree with leonard maltin, it is a cheap remake of fast times at ridgemont high, eddie van halen does the score, he was supposed to score fast times, but hit a dead end street somewhere, the last scene where they go through the wall to the next apartment is funny!!! Thomas jeffers drake, dad, your coming home with me right now, dad, its weird because I was at a party in morro bay california in 1984 and this scene actually happened in reality. It was because as you remember there was always a piano in a house,a dusty one and people would start to play, and the guy would go, don't play that piano, its my roomates!! well I guess they got sick of it, next thing you know, dan zavala and his brother go, back up, back up, we got a dance floor next store, and they 10 people hit the wall, they fall down, then back up, back up, they hit it again with all 40 and, crashhhh!!!!! well thats my review!!!!",1377388800,,939,4.193370165745856
7805114,2,630018384X,"This movie gave me memories from the 80's. The packaging was very well done and the movie was in an ""OK"" viewing. I know it was used but not worth $28.00+ tax and shipping and handling.",1362355200,,185,4.166666666666667
7805115,5,630018384X,Everytime I check to see if this movie is on DVD it says currently unavailible. Are you kidding me??? This movies is close to 30 years old and you can't print it on DVD yet??? Whoever owes the rights to this movie is an idiot because they losing millions on dollars sitting on this thing and not taking advantage of people like myself who would love to own this classic. WHAT A JOKE!!!,1355961600,,385,4.287671232876712
7805116,5,630018384X,I HAVE BEEN SUCH A FAN OF THIS MOVIE AND AM AFRAID TO PLAY MY OVERPLAYED BUT MINT CONDITION VCR TAPE IN FEAR IT WILL BE LOST FOREVER.  IT IS A CRIME THAT THE WILD LIFE HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED ON DVD.  MAY THE STARS ALINE AND THE RIGHT PEOPLE MAKE IT HAPPEN!,1349654400,,255,3.792452830188679
7805117,4,630018384X,"This movie is super funny. Hey, hairman! So many 80's (and other decade) movies get lumped together and are unfairly compared and panned. First, this has what a great, lasting comedy should have. It is FUNNY. Sure it's somewhat juvenile humor, but in a good way. This is hilarious comedy with real heart. The Vietnam back-story and the angst of the Jim character really seem real and not just an add on to the movie. The characters played by Penn (cool actor, laugh just thinking about him in the movie), Thompson, and Stolz really seemed like actual people, not just some unbelievable party animal/uptight geek cartoon characters.  I find many so called ""classic"" and ""iconic"" movies lack any heart or real comedy. Kind of like how the Grammies and the Oscars give awards to shart movies that everyone forgets about after a year. This movie is what every comedy should be, hilariously funny, completely rockin', classic movie.",1348012800,,927,4.904458598726115
7805118,5,630018384X,"This is a totally awesome 80's teen flick with a bitch'n cast and gnarly soundtrack.  Eddie Van Halen did the music score for the movie.  If you liked VH 1984 or 5150 sound, you'll love this one too. Chris Penn stars in this pivotal 80's role along with Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson make this work.  Randy Quaid as the wacked out War Vet is disturbing.  One notable character not doing much anymore but teaching students in a college in Texas is Iian Michael Smith.  Fellow famed ""Weird Science"" kid with Anthony Michael Hall (apparently you had to have 3 names and one being Michael to get in on that one).

This has an essence of being a sequel to ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".  It's made by some of the same people (Cameron Crowe) and it does star Sean Penn's (Spicoli) little brother, but It's never been verified as being such.

Please Hollywood, bring this one to DVD!  My VHS tape is dead and my Laserdisc failing as well.",1262736000,2,931,4.429411764705883
7805119,5,630018384X,"Please release ""The Wildlife"" on dvd.  There are so many other 80's flicks should be released also on dvd.  I would like to see ""Hot to Trot"", and ""Summer Job"" also released on dvd.  Wildlife brings back so many memories when I watched it.",1251504000,2,239,4.386363636363637
7805120,3,630018384X,"Of course, the movie itself is funny. Having it on VHS isn't the best of quality these days so if you could find it on DVD it would be best. Great movie of the 80's!",1248566400,,165,3.742857142857143
7805121,5,630018384X,"The movie is great, enough said.  The reason it is not on DVD is because of problems with the rights to the soundtrack.  There is a lot of material on it belonging to Ed Van Halen and he has been unwilling to allow the rights to transfer to DVD.  If you are a fan of Van Halen, speak up.",1232755200,3,287,3.830508474576271
