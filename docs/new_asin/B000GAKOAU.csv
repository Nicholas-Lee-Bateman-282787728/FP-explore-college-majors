8129925,5,B000GAKOAU,I purchased this to help students learn how to sign and sign holiday songs.  I want to create a sign language club at school and this will help me make it fun.,1375574400,,159,3.96875
8129926,4,B000GAKOAU,"My kindergarten students did a few songs for a Christmas program to which they sang and signed.  I didn't use the music in final proformance since the songs were quite fast. Not just my students had difficulty keeping up but so did I.  It was fun.  The girl signing was likeable.  Santa's visit was great. I would order again from the ""We Sign"" series.",1293408000,,352,4.453125
8129927,4,B000GAKOAU,"My son has other We Sign videos and they have the songs with the instructor and then the songs with the kids.  This video didn't have any kids in it, although there are some pictured on the DVD case.  Son enjoys having the songs with kids, so I'm kinda disappointed this didn't have any.",1291161600,,287,4.296296296296297
