8505292,5,B006W1T8QS,See my review of Varg Veum box 1. Same comment applies. Varg Veum is an interesting private eye in interesting settings in Bergen.,1369267200,,130,4.695652173913044
8505293,1,B006W1T8QS,"WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS DVD SET IS THAT IT'S A GREAT MYSTERY SERIES FILLED WITH ACTION, MYSTERY, AND A LITTLE BIT OF DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO....OF GREAT CONCERN IS WHAT IF YOU ORDER IT, THEN NEVER RECEIVE IT?  THE VENDOR, DAAVEEDEE, CLAIMS DELIVERY, BUT THEY SEND NO PROOF OF DELIVERY..AND SO WHAT IF THEIR DELIVERY STORY IS AS FISHY AT THE COUNTRY IT TAKES PLACE...BUT THE SERIES IS FUN TO WATCH, FULL OF MYSTERY AND MAYBE A BIT MORE VIOLENCE THAN THE TYPICAL US DETECTIVE SHOW...SO DO I CONTINUE TO DOWNLOAD TORRENTS OR BUY THIS, PAYING TWICE FOR SOMETHING DAAVEEDEE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY DELIVERED......THERE'S MORE MYSTERY WITH THEM, THAN THE MYSTERY OF THE STORIES....SO YOU CAN ENJOY THE SUSPENSE OF WAITING FOR YOUR ORDER, THE SUSPENSE OF WHERE YOU MISSING ORDER IS, THE SARCASTIC EMAILS THEY SEND BACK TO YOU WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT HAVING THE MISSING ORDER REPLACED.  THIS DVD SERIES IS PACKED FULL OF EXCITMENT AND FUN, BOTH FROM THE STORIES, AS WELL AS THE DELIVERY STORIES!  EVEN THE CONVOLUTED RUN-AROUND-EMAILS FROM DAAVEEDEE ARE A MYSTERY...PERHAPS WORTH AS MUCH AS THE ONCE I WANTED TO WATCH.....THE ONES YOU SOLD TO ME, BUT NEVER SENT....YEP, THOSE ONES.

SERIES THREE IS ONLY IN FOREIGN REGION 2 / PAL FORMATS SO ONE NEEDS TO HAVE A SPECIAL PLAYER TO WATCH THIS SEASON THREE.  THEN AGAIN, IF DAAVEEDEE DOES NOT SEND IT TO YOU, AND YOU PAID MONEY WHICH THEY REFUSE TO REFUND, THEN YOU CAN'T WATCH IT ANYWAY.

GIVEN THE QUALITY OF THIS SHOW, IF YOUR ORDER BECOMES LOST, I SUGGEST YOU AS DAAVEEDEE TO REPLACE IT.  THEY WON'T, SO ORDER THIS FROM ANY OTHER VENDOR, PREFERABLY AMAZON ITSELF.

THE SERIES IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY ON AN ALL REGION PLAYER, THEN WATCH AND WAIT, BUT DON'T GIVE UP.  AND IF DAAVEEDEE WON'T DO ANYTHING IF YOUR ORDER IS LOST...WELL, YOU WERE WARNED. AND BY THEN, THERE IS BOUND TO BE MORE HONEST VENDORS OUT THERE SELLING IT FOR USE ON YOU MADE-FOR-USA PLAYER, IN THE NEXT FEW SEASONS OR SO I WARNED YOU.",1363564800,5,1983,4.594900849858357
