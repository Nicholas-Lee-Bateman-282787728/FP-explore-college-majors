7807195,5,6300249808,"The divine Anna Massey delights with her astute observations of human nature in this film adaptation of Anita Brookner's ""Hotel Du Lac"" which won the Booker Prize in 1984. I loved the novel (and must now hunt down another copy as I can't find my old one) and it was only today that I chanced upon the film adaptation on Youtube. It stars Anna Massey as Edith Hope, a romance novelist who after some tumultuous events in her personal life, goes off on a sort of sabbatical to a hotel on Lake Geneva. There, she meets an assortment of characters: Mrs. Pusey and her daughter Jennifer, a rich ladies' man, Mr. Neville, etc.

Edith finds herself reassessing some of her initial impressions of these characters, and along the way finds herself charmed by and falling for Mr. Neville. However, the film really is an exploration of Edith's evolution as she attempts to find herself and reflect on her past mistakes. I loved how this was so well-conveyed in the film and recommend the film to anyone who enjoys a film that devotes itself to the study of human nature.

Anna Massey is absolutely amazing in her role (I am a a great fan) and she won a BAFTA for her role. Denholm Elliott as always, inhabits his role and delivers a credible performance as Neville. Excellent production all around.",1429401600,,1287,4.615720524017467

7807197,5,6300249808,"Hotel du Lac is a good story mainly because it is so well acted by Anna Massey.
The other actors are also good and compliment this story which is not all that
unusual but in this setting it is quite special.  Photography is also excellent
and I would highly recommend it to my friends.  A very different story here is
being told with quite a bit of sense of humor.",1341878400,2,364,4.185714285714286
7807198,5,6300249808,"A sharp, subtle gem; I picked up a VHS copy somewhere in my travels and finally got around to watching it.  Because it is VHS there is a faded quality to the production which interestingly enhances the film as it is a faded story in a faded time.  Ah, but the dialogue - the interactions and interplay of the characters - smacks you upside your head with its wit and its thought.  No fading there.",1322006400,2,397,4.266666666666667
7807199,1,6300249808,"Could not play it on my DVD player. have contacted the company it came from. Have yet to send it back. That is time consuming. They claim it said on the explanation. I don't remember reading. I will be careful about ordering from another company I have ordered many times from amazon.

7807200,5,6300249808,"What a great story.  I hadn't seen it in years and was so pleased to discover it again.  It is a movie to get lost in. A time and a place to lazily drift through and just enjoy being.  There is a beauty in her freedom and freedom of choice.  And love, true love in the end win out.",1262995200,3,281,3.711864406779661
7807201,5,6300249808,"An adaptation more faithful to the original book you will not find. This wistfully acted, beautifully photographed British television production of Anita Brookner's Booker Prize winning novel is a delight to watch over and  over again to pick up on nuances perhaps overlooked in a single viewing.  Anna Massey, here middle-aged (remember her as Tom Courtenay's young victim  in Michael Powell's Peeping Tom?) is perfectly cast as Edith, a romance  writer who knows her market and who is in self-imposed exile after leaving  her prospective groom waiting, with all her friends, outside the church  because she thinks she has something better than a loveless marriage to  keep her occupied. At the Hotel du Lac she encounters the most eccentric  characters, who are also on the run from themselves, including a rapidly  aging ingenue and her mother, played by the marvelous Googie Withers (see  her also in Expresso Bongo with the very young Cliff Richard), a young  woman with 'an eating disorder' that keeps her from starting a family, and  the elderly Countess played to perfection by Irene Handl in one of her very  last roles. Edith also receives an alternative offer of marriage from a  jaded businessman played by Denholm Elliott. All of the actors are top  notch but the Swiss background is the real star here. For quiet  contemplative drama with brittle yet insightful dialogue much of it carried  over from the book, don't miss Hotel du Lac. I only wish this was available  on DVD, my preferred format for collecting these days.",963187200,23,1536,4.980314960629921
