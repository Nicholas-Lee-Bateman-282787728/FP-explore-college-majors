This is your dvd's, it shows flash floods, tsunamis, twisters, mud slides, dust storm, ice storms,class 5 hurricanes, helicopter crash, etc. Very at close, and short interviews to people that witness the event.

3650338,5,B001IZNJ3G,"This is a compilation of disasters, hurricanes, tornadoes and others as seen on the Weather Channel. What we see, is not only the weather, but its impact on the people in its path and the damage left behind. We hear from the survivors that describe what happened to them and get a good view of exactly what is going on. If one is interested in the weather, here is a sample of some of the worst Nature can do.",1389916800,,409,4.189873417721519

3650341,5,B001IZNJ3G,"I know humanity likes to think that we are the masters of the planet.  We also like to believe that there is no situation we can't handle.  Well guess what, these dvds prove that there are plenty of situations we can't solve, never mind handle them.  The natural world shows use what real power is, and the only thing we are able to do is pick up the pieces.  JRV",1366243200,,363,4.142857142857143

3650346,1,B001IZNJ3G,such sensationalistic drivel and that panders to people's fears without providing real science - I have no more to say.,1355875200,,119,5.0
3650347,4,B001IZNJ3G,"Full force nature gives excellent footage of tornados, floods, overflowing rivers and hurricanes filmed by persons who lived through the drama. It shows vividly how frightening and destructive these natural occurences are. For a person who lives in a country where there are no tornados or avalanches the description given by the persons who experienced them,  is good and gives one a feel of the magnitude and danger of these forces of nature. For example describing a tornado's sound like a train gives a feeling of just how loud and extremely powerful it is.
 The editing is not good in some places with images flashing onto the screen in rapid sucession or fast forward mode. It is tiring and disturbing to watch.
Overall it is facinating and interesting to watch and highly recommended for persons interested in the power and effect of nature set free.",1349740800,2,857,4.903448275862069

8311598,4,B001IZNJ3G,This is a series of episodes called Full Force Nature. 12 in total. The only problem was you have no way of knowing what is in each episode. You might have 2 floods then a tornadoes then a flood again then hail.  The footage was real which the students enjoyed but it was hard to find what I was looking for. I was trying to find wildfires. An index of each would be so helpful. Good educational movie for at the end of a unit on extreme weather.,1402876800,,446,4.068181818181818
