4233537,5,B003ZE73GW,Good things have to come to an end but it was sad to see this incredible show end. I've seen the actors in other shows and movies but this was a great show with a different point of view.  I think most of us in the U.S. is tired of seeing Border movies and shows about Mexico and like World War II movies how many ways can you say the same thing!  If you have seen the first two seasons of The Border no one has to tell you to get the third. It really leaves with a cliff-hanger ending.,1358985600,,486,3.85
4233538,5,B003ZE73GW,This is an outstanding series. I want to see it all. I hope that mare Australians will get exposure to this great drama out of Canada.,1356220800,,134,4.1923076923076925
4233539,4,B003ZE73GW,"I really enjoyed every season so far and looking forward to seeing the next seasion.  The last season left me want more, it was just that good!!  When is the next season airing.",1354492800,,177,4.333333333333333
4233540,5,B003ZE73GW,"The border is an excellent series .Full of drama , excitement and plenty of action .  season 1-3  is the complete show. Well acted and written . you cant stop watching it when you get into the first couple of episodes . great stories and surprizes. I would recommend you to buy it and watch it . You won't be dissapointed .I loved it.",1342828800,,334,4.203125
4233541,5,B003ZE73GW,"The Border Season 3; the last season; their is no more; I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the show and knew 'going in' this 3rd season was it. What I didn't know was how shocking the ending would be and what my reaction would be? So without giving away the plot let me just say my reaction was ""Wow, that was incredible"". Like many viewers I'm sure, I was left breathless and upset by how the show ended for a few minutes and was mad their would be no more episodes. But then I thought--the ending was awesome because you don't know what will happen to the characters and you never will and your left intensely wanting MORE! A TV show that effects you so much you want MORE? That's not a BAD thing I realized, its a great thing. The show got me so invested I was mad it didn't continue; how many TV shows can you say that about? Not many in my experience.

So the 3rd season continues the same story lines from S-1,and 2, with the ICS Agents working closely with Grace Park from the Dep't of Homeland Security, and like before they are fast paced with just the right mix of action/drama and living up to the description of the show as ""24 meets MI-5"". I can't imagine why CBC cancelled this show cause I thought it was great and different enough from typical ""American"" cop/spy/CSI type shows to gather a loyal following and high ratings. But...lots of shows I think are great get cancelled and lots of ones I think are crap stay on--so be it. This series was 38 great episodes, or nearly 40 hours of 'edge of your seat' entertainment--so who says their is nothing good on TV? And the show ends with a scene reminiscent of the movie ""Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid"" a movie made in 1969 and where the 'ending' is still talked about. I LOVED this show; I LOVED season 3; I recommend the entire series.",1331424000,14,1801,4.297058823529412
4233542,5,B003ZE73GW,"Not only do they end the series with a cliff hanger, but this show was the best on TV period for the 2009/2010 TV season. Note that I didn't say on Canadian TV. Spooks in the UK and the second half of 24 were close, though The Border was a series that was coming into its own. The show has a wide cult following and I have heard nothing of ratings issues, so why did the CBC take off their schedule? Personally painful is that I now have to get my Grace Park fix via a remake of Hawaii Five O! First Intelligence and now The Border! I am guessing that there must be some corporate strategy where a hit show is developed and then cancelled before it's time?

I highly recommend watching all 3-seasons!",1294272000,11,700,4.185185185185185

4233546,5,B003ZE73GW,I'm Canadian so I love it. I love all the anti-American jokes because I agree with them!! I can understand why the show was criticized for this though. The show is well done - good (excellent) writing. If you are a touchy American - don't watch. If you're a Canadian or good humored American enjoy one of the better homeland security dramas. I bought all three seasons.,1424304000,,369,4.522388059701493
4233547,5,B003ZE73GW,Great series!!,1414022400,,14,6.5

4233549,4,B003ZE73GW,"All the story lines are gripping and hold your interest to the end.
The last episode is a cliff hanger and have read there isn't a fourth season.
So, will never know how the siege ends.",1411603200,,185,4.166666666666667
4233550,2,B003ZE73GW,"The show itself is good, its nice to see the Canadian perspective.  But the first DVD was defective and the vendor refused to replace it supposedly because it was too late.  So beware of this vendor.",1409616000,,199,4.5
4233551,1,B003ZE73GW,"The last episode on this dvd was hugely disappointing, leaving the audience completely in the dark about the ending.",1409011200,,116,5.157894736842105

Great acting, great story just want more",1404259200,,132,4.541666666666667
4233553,5,B003ZE73GW,"When it comes to issues of national security, toleration, freedom of speech and privacy rights, internet usage, terrorism and military policy, etc., this show can't be beat. It explores them at a more sophisticated level than other similar shows. And it raises questions about these issues (e.g., about unethical American encroachment on the sovereignty of other nations) that other shows, especially American ones, just don't have the guts or acumen to raise. Highly entertaining and enlightening.",1400457600,,498,5.565789473684211
4233554,5,B003ZE73GW,"Loved this series, great characters and excellent stories, i always like watching these types of shows because they show how difficult it is to protect our borders and it looks very real you won't want to miss this series",1398297600,2,221,4.6923076923076925
4233555,5,B003ZE73GW,"I gulped down Seasons 1-3 of The Border and am crying for more, more, more! Canada has put out some great shows that I'm am beginning to favor more than what's available here. The writing focuses on issues and characters rather than sex and violence, with believable stories and outcomes. I'm looking forward to watching more Canadian television as they release it. This series was one of the best I've ever seen and highly recommend it to those interested in intelligent and well cast television shows. Really sorry it wasn't renewed.",1395532800,,535,4.8901098901098905
4233556,5,B003ZE73GW,"This TV series had a 3 year run and I am so thatkful that I was able to get Season 1 and Season 3 Through Amazon..If you like great police-type, detective-type story lines than this series is for you.  At the time I purchased Season 1 and 3 was not available but I was able to purchase it at a late date.  Buy it - you will NOT be disappointed - it is full of exciting and thrilling scenes.",1393459200,,390,3.9240506329113924
4233557,4,B003ZE73GW,"enjoyed these seasons. though didn't get around to watching them till 3-4 months after getting them.  unfortunately realized that there were at least 2 episodes that glitched pretty badly!!  and at this rate, I cant resell them either!  Also, they left the season up in the air and haven't made any more seasons so it ended horribly!",1391558400,,333,4.807017543859649
4233558,5,B003ZE73GW,"I can see why American television did not like this series. The  Border was exciting, well written and  the actors/actresses were racially diverse and interesting -just like the plots. Ordinary people doing a j-o-b- in a 'keep the viewing audience engaged' manner!!!!!",1388188800,,268,5.357142857142857

4233560,2,B003ZE73GW,"Firstly, I must say, I don't BLAME the actors... this show is a BLATANT Anti-American series... OFTEN attempting to score points with an Anti-American pro democratic progressive agenda...  action is minimal, too many sex scenes and complications from personal affairs...  an attempt to copy the very successful ""24"" series ... ends abruptly, and I am guessing the critics BURIED it NOT to find out what happens to a climatic cliffhanging scene.. my thoughts were, ""who cares""... so am happy to move on.. again.. I am CERTAIN this was due to the writers, NOT the actors, who were very good in their roles...",1383264000,2,606,4.931372549019608
4233561,5,B003ZE73GW,"My interest in canadian drama is new, but I am now involved / some great series and I can see how American tv decided to follow up.  I have not started this series yet, and series three will be the last,  Still, I am sure it will be great.  In terms of delivery and security of package there can be no complaints.  Thank you.",1376697600,,325,4.03125
