4313053,3,B004B3PB74,"CASE 39 starts out as an interesting drama, becomes tense and frightening as any good horror movie should, and then sells out in the end with simply too many special effects for the sake of inducing nightmares in the audience  to retain its potential stature as a very fine Grand Guignol film.

Emily (Rene Zellweger) is an overworked but committed family problems case worker, investigating homes that seem to breed dysfunctional children.  She has some fine associates - psychologist Doug (Bradley Cooper in a fine performance), case manager Wayne (Adrian Lester), and detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane).  Emily takes on Case 39, a 10 year old child Lily (Jodelle Ferland) who seems to be terrified of her parents.  Emily visits the home, befriends Lily, then discovers that Lily's parents - especially father (Callum Keith Sullivan) - are attempting to kill her.  The parents are arrested and placed in a mental institution and out of a sense of duty and caring Emily manages to become the temporary foster parent of the deeply disturbed Lily.  It seems Lily has strange powers and those powers include discovering the basic fears of those around her and playing on those fears in a manner that has disastrous results. As Emily grows to understand Lily she sees the connection with evil incarnate and the remainder of the film is how Emily and the world deal with this creature from the dark world.

Each of the actors makes the most of a script that has far too many holes in it: it seems that the writer (Ray Wright) and director (Christian Alvart) couldn't decide on whether they wanted to create a truly terrifying psychological drama or simply go off the deep end and opt for over the top CGI effects.  Zellweger manages to find fine screen chemistry with Cooper and McShane, but that doesn't make up for the seemingly endless chaos the film elects as its center.  Good potential - should have been re-edited. Grady Harp, January 11",1294704000,,1941,4.836858006042296
4313054,3,B004B3PB74,"Renee Zellweger must have needed some quick cash to take a role in CASE 39, an unexceptional horror movie, described (in the extras) as ""part THE BAD SEED and part THE EXORCIST). For myself, I saw a great deal of THE RING in this, though THE RING is a far more effective movie, the kind that can give an adult a sleepless night.

The best casting in CASE 39 isn't Zellweger, who plays a passionate Social Worker, it's Jodelle Fernald, who plays Lillith, the little girl. Just as THE RING had it's protagonist Samarra (as in the story ""Death in Samarra"") CASE 39 has it's protagonist, Lillith. For anyone unfamiliar with the legend, Lillith was supposed to have been Adam's first wife. She was supposed to have abandoned him in the Garden of Eden, ultimately to transform into a demoness. If you know that tale, half of CASE 39 gives itself up as soon as we hear the little girl called by name.

Still, we're not quite sure who the bad guy is, especially when Zellweger and a cop friend find Lillith's parents sealing her inside their kitchen oven in an attempt to kill her. This might bring to mind either ""Hansel and Gretel"" or Buchenwald. Either way, it's the best, most effective scene in the film. The parents are arrested for attempted murder, and Zellweger is quite unrealistically given custody of the child.

All seems well, until people around Zellweger start getting strange calls (think the VCR tape in THE RING, again), that inspire them to kill others or themselves. Afterward, the film degenerates quickly into thorough predictablity.

Worth watching once, there's nothing here to draw you back again. CASE 39 would have been much better if it had left the viewer wondering a few things but it doesn't.",1294617600,2,1716,4.71
4313055,4,B004B3PB74,"Case 39 is a fun psychological horror movie with MINIMAL special effects and solidly 'based in reality.' There are only a few scenes where you get a glimpse of the evil living within the young girl. I really like that because it forces the writers to tell a good story rather than relying on special effects. For me, walls melting, books flying, people levitating, etc, etc . . . isn't particularly scary.

There is also minimal blood; a number of people are brutally killed, but the gore is kept to a comfortable and reasonable level. The blood serves a purpose and tells the story, its not just gore for the sake of gore (Saw II-IX, I'm looking at you)

When it was finished, the story felt like a Steven King formula: 95% of the people are perfectly normal and grounded in reality, but one character is haunted / possessed / evil and everybody reacts accordingly. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick: it's not the best thing I've ever seen, but still very enjoyable.",1294531200,3,965,4.604651162790698
4313056,3,B004B3PB74,"I thought this was in the psychological thriller genre, not the horror. That said, home alone on a cold, snowy winter night makes for scary stuff, I actually had to turn it off and come back in the light of day in the morning. I liked the movie and thought the acting was great especially the little girl.",1294444800,2,305,4.275862068965517
4313057,3,B004B3PB74,"Renee Z plays a hard-working social worker with a heart of gold, whose equally nice best friend (Bradley Cooper) is trying to date her in between providing useful exposition. Her latest case - number 39 - is about two strange parents with a seemingly regular little girl - they attempt to murder her by baking (in an oven), and the girl is put up for adoption. Naturally, Renee petitions to become the new parent and the story starts.

The trailer actually gives away most of the movie's major surprises and shock points, so needless to say, the little girl turns out to be a demon with pigtails and does the requisite threatening behavior and adult-type language moments we've come to expect. That's a shame, since The Orphan was a better version of the same thing. Although Case 39 has its moments, they're few and far between, with Act 2 seeing all the major characters being killed off, and Act 3 being a series of action set-pieces designed to kill the demon. The rare moments of CGI aren't very good and Renee Z sleepwalks her way through this. It's a good film to watch casually if it were free on Netflix, but I wouldn't pay to watch.",1294358400,,1142,4.543689320388349
4313058,4,B004B3PB74,"****SPOILER FREE REVIEW****

I love how the movie starts off normal then slowly takes us into the realm of Horror.  This type of genre ""good child whom is really evil"" is starting to be a bit over done and well traversed.  Be that as it may, this movie was decent.  Acting is superb, Rene of course can really do no wrong.

The child actress is phenonmenal as well (where do they find these kids?)

The introduction of the supernatural feels organic, I was fine with more or less everything.

When I think of this movie, I think of a diet version of ""The Ring"".
Not too bad.  I'd give it 3.5 stars but Amazon doesn't do the 1/2 star thing so I gave it 4 stars.",1294358400,57,660,4.182539682539683
4313059,3,B004B3PB74,"An overworked Social Worker (Zellweger) picks up a case involving a little girl (Ferland) being abused by her parents.  Emily (Zellweger) pulls strings and adopts Lilly (Ferland) in order to help her.  There are very few things that scare me in movies.  The biggest one is creepy kids, which this movie has.  After a vicious attack by her parents Lilly finds a new loving home with Emily.  After strange happenings Emily begins to wonder how crazy Emily's parents were.  The little girl (Ferland) does a fantastic job of creeping me out.  This movie runs along the line of being believable and far fetched...playing both sides makes it even creeper then if if stayed on one side of the fence or the other.  Nothing outstanding but creepy enough to have to watch with the lights on.  I give it a B-.",1294272000,35,798,4.642857142857143
4313060,3,B004B3PB74,"Renee Zellweger is a talented actress. There is no question about that. And she is certainly surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including the reliable Bradley Cooper and Ian McShane. The story is a familiar one; a concerned case worker begins to notice that bad things seem to happen in the presence of a certain young child. At first, nobody seems to believe her, and when she finally convinces those close to her that the child may in fact be responsible for these sinister doings, it may be too late.

Cooper and McShane are exceptional, and Zellweger does well with a sparse script. She does not have a whole lot to work with here, but she makes it work, and the film is just good enough to keep you entertained for 90 minutes. This movie is a cross between ""Orphan,"" ""The Ring,"" and ""The Omen,"" although it is not quite as good as those films. It would be a good rental or even a worthwhile purchase for fans of this genre, though, as long as you are not expecting too much. Sometimes, even though something has been done before and you kind of know how things are going to turn out, it can still be fun getting there. And while I would stop short of calling this film ""fun,"" I found it to be mildly disturbing in some parts, and genuinely entertaining in most others.",1294012800,77,1280,4.446808510638298

4313065,3,B004B3PB74,"Pros: Renee Zellweger feels authentic; Jodelle Ferland was spooky enough; good cast, good enough scares

Cons: Plot is a bit disjointed. Derivative

 You believe in there (points at the church), but out here it's all just bull$h! t?

the plot

 Emily Jenkins is an overworked social worker buried under thirty-eight active cases dealing with families living in the urban area of her city. Her supervisor Wayne possibly feeling overworked himself unloads one more case onto Emily. She protests at first but she is committed to keeping busy and distracted and immediately takes a peak at case 39. Its on a family of three, where the parents are accused of possible neglect of their daughter Lilith by the school as her grades have taken a 180. As Emily sits down with the family she notices Liliths apparent fear of her parents and instigates a sit down with social services at the main office. Lilith confides in Emily that her parents hate her and want to send her to Hell. She gives Lilith her home phone and told her that she can call whenever she wants. She calls that night and tells Emily that she is scared. Emily goes over to the house with her police friend Mike and break down the door when they hear screams. They enter a horrific scene of the parents Ed and Margaret shoving Lilith into the oven, taping the door closed and turning on the fire. The parents are jailed; Lilith is saved and eventually convinces Emily to take her in herself to live with her.

 Emily eventually relents and enjoys the situation, that is until strange happenings seem to envelop her life. Her friends are threatened and attacked, some of her other cases are plagued with sudden violence that seem to stem from phone calls coming from her home late at night. She begins to fear Lilith and begins to see her in the light that her former abusive parents see her in. Lilith is very cute and very small, so when Emily reaches out to others for help she is met with resistance. She turns to Liliths parents in jail and listens to their side of the story. They claim that Lilith is a demon from Hell, what if they're right?

the breakdown

 For the Halloween season, Netflix has this in their on demand library with a bevy of other supernatural horror flicks to satisfy those of us with a void that can only be filled by this genre. I happened to catch this during some downtime on my cell phone during the day, and it still managed to creep me out enough to appreciate this one. Renee Zellweger against type portrays a mildly attractive social worker named Emily who sincerely cares for the urban families she encounters on the job. Her character has a friendly front which gets pushed to the breaking limit as the stress, lack of sleep and plain old fear has been hoist upon her by this demon disguised as a pretty young girl. I suppose at this point in films history, the movie makers don't worry about criticisms like derivative or been there done that. Especially when it comes to the horror genre, the movie makers unabashedly steal from other more successful films. As far as horror films go, we don't really see too many new ideas out there, but even we the movie watchers don't seem to mind. Sure, in the back of our minds we realize that this film is like Orphan, which is like The Omen IV which is like The Omen and so on, but it doesnt really matter as long as it delivers the fright scenes. So, this is the situation we have here.

 Plus, even though this was listed among the supernatural horror films, there weren't any real other-worldly scares from this film. Most of the movie just kept you on edge. This demon was able to tell you about your past, it sometimes knew what you were thinking and it never slept much. It also made other people kill for it by suggesting it by either phone call or a whisper in their ear. There was also the tool of power of suggestion where it can make you believe things are happening which would make you kill yourself. It seemed that there were too many instances of how this demon works, usually the bad guy has some sort of M.O., but this creature from Hell borrowed from as many movies as it could to be effective, and it was  you never feel safe from it. Nothing was shocking, but there was a sense of relentlessness about the demon. By the way, young Jodelle Ferland did a good job of portraying this demon. Ian McShane was the fearless policeman who assisted Emily in her quest to snuff out Lilith. Her boyfriend was Bradley Cooper, an early role for him, as this film was originally meant for release in 2006.

 I was surprised to find that this was rated R. There was only one use of the 'F' bomb, and it wasn't very gory and there was no sex at all. This could have easily been a PG-13. All in all, it was good enough to keep you on your toes, Im sure this is much more effective in a dark living room watching it alone.  I give this movie three stars.

This is a pretty low grade product, based on my experience, and I had to buy two of them.  The first, which was returned and refunded, skipped and froze up, and it was thoroughly unwatchable.  The second, the replacement, played well enough, but the sound quality was terrible: the volume went up and down, and there were little static blips and qudio skips throughout the movie.  My recommendation would be to wait for a better release, or splurge and go for the Blu-Ray (which HAS to be better, right?).

4313169,4,B004B3PB74,"I found this movie to be intriguing and interesting.  It plays on your sympathies for children and the underlying assumption that they are always innocent.  I think the best part of the movie is how it makes you explore those feelings/assumptions and possibly revise your opinions.  Renee did a great job of portraying the hero/mother figure who begins on this principle assumption and has to act as her understanding increases.  Characters that may begin as 'monsters' may not seem so as the movie continues.  I think she did an excellent job of portraying the contradicting feelings that she was going through and the resulting guilt and horror she feels as she has to act in self-preservation.  If you're looking for a true 'horror' movie or a spooky jump out at you kind of movie, this is not it.  The 'horror' of this movie is in the psychological response that it invokes in delving into the altering of that underlying assumption.  Nicely done.",1433376000,,951,4.827160493827161

4313187,5,B004B3PB74,"I believe horror films can be psychological therapy.  I loved the finalism of Emily/Zelwiger declaring ,  ""I'm not afraid"" to the demon that was posessing the little girl (ironically named Lily, though her intentions governed by the demon were not ""lily white""), and asking the girl/demon, ""Are you afraid?"", while driving into a lake.  It looked like the girl was afraid!  And the shoe was on the other foot !! Finally !  This was liberating !  I am going through some things where someone in my life is truly a manipulative demon, and it seems all she is trying to do is scare me to control me, and I need to make it clear that she is not scaring me, and she is not in control !  I will not be driving anyone off a cliff or into a lake, but this movie really helped me get perspective on how I've been so easily manipulated, and how I've been so ""facile"".  I have not been ""smug"" however.  Yes, this movie reminds me of my family (sister and mom, and sometimes me) sadly.  In real life you can't kill anyone, you just develope heart disease.  Or you find perspective through a movie like this .  :-)  So next time my sister or my mom are trying to scare me in order to control me, I will think of them as that manipulative main character girl/demon and I will say, ""I'm not scared"", ""Are you?"", ""You should be, b/c your need to frighten, manipulate, and control is not going to be met"".  I often think of my sister as a vampire, a toxic, bloodsucking, emotional vampire.  She will now starve !! :-)  This movie has really liberated me  !  !",1425686400,,1542,4.295138888888889

4313222,4,B004B3PB74,"This is a good movie...period.  Whoever wrote the review for Amazon was way off the mark. First off, don't read the box or the summary as it will only ruin the surprises and great turns. What starts off as a mystery turns into a supernatural thriller. I don't want to give away anything so just sit back and watch a great movie. If you don't know what is coming it will delight you as it did me.",1403395200,,395,4.12987012987013
4313223,4,B004B3PB74,"I might as well kick-start this review by saying if you enjoyed the film The Orphan, then this movie you might well be able to consider a sequel. Even tho it has nothing to do with The Oprhan in anyway, it's a movie that has enough similarities to call it a sequel in the way Halloween III was supposed to start the Halloween franchise on a roll of sequels that where just horror films with a simmilar tone, rather than a Captain Kirk Mime obsessed with knifes and his sister.

This film see's Renee Zelwegger .... wait, wait, I know... look.... I'm not a fan of her either OK, I don't even like Harry Potter or Lord of The Rings, but she is tolerable in this film OK? She left her diary at home in this one so she's not making a kiddie flick or a romantic comedy here, so guys, stick around, it's not so bad. Ok so she plays a case worker, and shes already neck deep in 38 cases when her boss throws case 39 at her. A little girl named Lilith appears to have parents that are doing something very strange to Lilith. Emily (thats Renee Zellashwartzenegger) thinks something more than she can prove is going on in that house, but is told not to get involved in-case the parents sue for having no evidence. Low and behold Emily ignores protocol and interferes, just in time before something horrible happened to Lilith. Now the parents have been sent to a nuthouse and Emily finds herself taking custody of Lilith to begin a happy life together, or will they?

Honestly, the casting choice in this film is something I would expect my Twilight loving wife to enjoy and not myself, but I found this one very interesting and entertaining right to the end. Again, if you like The Orphan, give this one a go, it's definitely a movie you would place in or next to The Orphan, and don't be surprised if one day the two films are sold together. It's not a bloody horror, there is no gore, it's not shocking, and it's not scary, but neither was The Orphan, it's a decent film and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in seeing it.",1403395200,,2020,4.341269841269841

4313234,5,B004B3PB74,"I love this movie!!!  And, the thought of paying retail price for it, I would have but I always order through Amazon.com.  I love the fact that I ordered some stuff before this movie and I received the movie before them.  Speedy delivery!  The condition of the case and DVD, impeccable; looked brand new.  All in all, I'd give two thumbs up for my favorite Jodelle Ferland movie, who plays Lilith; but she also plays in two other strange yet interesting movies, Tideland and The Tall Man.  For such a young actress, she seems so mature for her age.

Thank you much!",1392249600,,565,4.480392156862745

4313236,4,B004B3PB74,"Wow, what a good movie. The ""A"" list actors do a great job bringing this drama thriller to the screen and will entertain you immensely! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys pure entertainment.",1390780800,,206,4.75
4313237,4,B004B3PB74,"I just watched the remake of ""Carrie"" -- you might legitimately ask, ""Which one?"" as there have been quite a few now -- and I give nothing away when I say that, at the beginning of the film, the director changed it up a bit from the original by showing the birth of Carrie, and almost the murder of that baby by her mother.  I watched the original ""Carrie"" about six months ago, and I have to admit that I can't remember how it started, although I believe that the remake was different.

In ""Case 39,"" I give nothing away when I say that the parents of a child try to cook her alive in an oven during act one.  Well, in both films, lets just say that neither set of parents are successful in infanticide (or ""childcide""), which is important in the development of plot.  Naturally, if Carrie White dies she never gets to the prom.  If Lillith -- note the name, which is intended -- dies, then, well, we never have a Case 39 for Renee Zellweger to investigate.

The reason why I am comparing and contrasting these two films is not that they necessarily have drastically different endings, but rather because they start out in similar fashions, but have differing paths to somewhat similar ends.  But the big difference really is that, while this film is not a ""twisteroo"" per se, it does turn the audiences' own belief system somewhat on its head as this film progresses.  Let's just say that in ""Case 39,"" the character that you root for flip-flops over the course of the film, while in ""Carrie,"" the protagonist mostly remains your same protagonist throughout, even though maybe you will fear that protagonist a bit more by the end.  In ""Case 39,"" it's hard to root for the initial protagonist throughout the film is all that I will say.

I just watched this film again tonight (2014Jan26) as it was on ""free"" TV, and one item that really caught my attention on a second or third viewing:  I really liked how Lilith co-opted the language of social services, co-opted it for the purposes of making fun of it, of course.  Not only that, the viewer quickly realizes how ridiculous that language sounds, as it makes so many assumptions that even the speaker of it -- usually a social services worker -- could no way in hell believe the garbage herself.  ""Come on; walk the talk!"" would be but one very cheesy example.  But because of this, I am guessing that conservatives will enjoy this film more than liberals, but that is only a guess.

Even though I gave the ""Carrie"" remake a 4, I gave it a very weak 4.  On the other hand, I'm giving this film a very strong 4.  I could go 5 here, except that I didn't much like the ending.  Oh, it's not that I hated it.  But I just think that, if one were to think about it for awhile, one could come up with a better ending without too much trouble.  But more than likely, there are alternate endings -- endings which I haven't seen -- and more than likely, the director actually shot multiple endings and hemmed and hawed as to which one that he would eventually use for the release version.

Ultimately, I believe that there were some reasonable motivations for remaking ""Carrie,"" with the major reason being that it was made 40 years ago and special effects have greatly advanced since that timeframe.  I believe that this film was an original screenplay and was the first version, and if that is true, it surely had a greater reason to be made.

But I will give the nod to the lead here (more than likely, this film positions Ms. Zelwegger as the lead, but that wouldn't be correct in my opinion) -- Jodelle Ferland -- over any of the Carries, be they Sissy Spacek, Chloe Moretz, or that other girl who was in that other remake.  As a matter of fact, I would say that Ms. Ferland is scarier here than Linda Blair was in the ""The Exorcist.""  Ms. Ferland certainly gives a better performance than Ms. Blair ever did.  ""Blasphemy!"" I can already hear, but hear me out:

In the ""The Exorcist,"" all Ms. Blair had to do was lay around awhile and endure long makeup sessions, and then lay around some more and writhe.  The real acting was mostly done by the voice over, done by someone else.  And if you have ever seen Ms. Blair in later roles (watch ""Exorcist:  The Heretic,"" or better yet, do not, as that is probably the worst horror film of all time) or the roller skating film that she starred in, you will quickly realize that her acting was on the skill level of After School Specials.  Ms. Ferland, however, really holds her own here, and she will truly scare the hell out of you as her frights are more psychological.  Like I said in my ""Carrie"" review, it's too bad that the director of ""Twilight"" didn't give Ms. Ferland more than just bit parts.  She's surely better than many of the so-called stars in that near mess of a strange Vampire soap opera.

Well, I hope that I've made my case for ""Case 39"" over ""Carrie,"" any one of them.  And I hope that I've made my case that Ms. Ferland is underrated.  And I further hope that directors and casting directors give her more substantial roles in the future.",1390176000,,5052,4.423783783783784

It's the high probability that she's being neglected and possibly abused by her wacked-out parents that puts CPS worker Emily Jenkins into her life. But what starts as a psychological case study gets really eerie really quickly.

The way the movie switches to supernatural horror is actually quite jarring, and not in a good way. The tone is all over the place. So by the time demonic insects start flying out of a guy's ears, you already know you're watching something silly. But I like both Lily and Emily. It's those two characters alone make the movie worth watching.

Her weapon is simple: make people live their fears to the utmost end of them, so that they kill someone, kill themselves, get killed by someone. You name it you have it. And never answer her challenge: ""If you tell me what you fear I will tell you what I fear.""  Or in reverse order, but the result is the same.

It is a good lesson to social workers any way. Social workers are there to keep dangerous cases and disturbing cases in the margin of society and they must not try to make them right and they must especially not try to get involved in them. Social Services stand for SS and that's all. You don't do no good there. You just keep those who cannot be productive within the limits of the social concentration camp known as welfare or social security, another famous SS institution. At least that's what Loic Wacquant from University of California at Berkeley would tell you.

He will add, due to his perfect social Marxist training he got in France, Paris Sorbonne probably, like Angela Davis, that we have to rebel against the fascist plot of this capitalistic society that only wants to keep 20% of the social body, the 20% that cannot be productive, in a complete inferno that is called the prison system for males and social welfare for females and children, and to guarantee that you have films like this one or the Exorcist, or so many more, or Stephen King and Anne Rice, to entertain you into believing it is the only way we can contain devils, demons, Satan and Lucifer, cross my heart. If you are white all these monsters will be black of course and if you are Black all these monsters will be white of course, say I swear to god.

We are all manipulated into believing we are the top of the cream and there are 20% of social rubbish and waste that is trying to come after us, and you know what John Wayne would tell you in such a case, kill the mall before the yellow-ribboned cavalry arrives. Their job is to clean behind us. No more Little Big Horn, please, so let the good vigilantes do the work and the cavalry will bring the industrial Krcher vacuum cleaners to pick the crumbs and the debris.

These films make me laugh and I just wonder how people can be so nave to be entertained and what's more manipulated by them. And the left-leaning middle class intellectual can say what they want Stephen King is great literature and Anne Rice is marvelous creative writing.

I do not refer to satanic beasties when I say, ""unrealistic,"" but rather to how Child Protective Services work. In the United States, and in most countries, CPS requires only a strong suspicion of danger to the child to call the police and remove the child to protective custody. There is no need to be ""a loose cannon cop with something to prove"" to bust potentially abusive parents: the law is on the side of CPS, and tasks them with PREVENTING abuse as much as collecting evidence of its existence. Simple neglect is quite enough to be a just cause for taking the child in for a period of time for more intense examination. Zellweger could simply have written a report stating that the child made troubling verbal statements that amount to a cry for help and threatened security...

Anyway... rant mode off. Basic point: if you threaten a CPS worker like the parents seemed to do in the first scene, then you will be in for a world of hurt, as CPS has quite a lot of power to defend themselves and the children in their care.",1361923200,,1134,4.451923076923077

So I was really suprised when the whole story was laid bare within the first half hour -- I kept expecting some sort of twist to take things to a different level. Instead, some rather nonsensical plotting occurs in order to stretch things out. Even the characters are just filler, with no believable motivation behind their actions; they're just doing what needs to be done, saying what needs to be said, to get the story from point A to point B. I could've watched the first half hour, then skipped ahead to the last ten minutes, and been just as satisfied as if I'd watched the whole thing (and I wasn't very satisfied).  If you're interested in what this movie might have to offer and haven't seen The Omen or The Ring, I suggest watching one of those films instead.

But, the story covers that in the early part with Renee questioning the liberal doctrination of her field, so that sets us up for a more believable conversion, which then sets us up for her taking matters into her own hands in dealing with Rosemary's baby.

Rene ends up rescuing the girl from parents that are attempting to Hansel and Gretel her to death. Lilith stays with Rene (Emily) until she can get a foster home. While Rene is picking up stuff at the little girl's home she notices large dead bolts on the inside of her parent's door. At this point the plot is fairly well established and you can guess the rest of the film.

The acting was superb. Jodelle Ferland was excellent, with the highlight being the scene with Rene's smug boyfriend. ""How did you answer number 12?"" Sweet.

There were no great twists in the plot, not really a surprise ending. These were really needed to distinguish this movie from other demon kid movies.

Rene Zellweger's is Emily, the Social Worker trying to save Lillith, the ""poor kid""  from her evil parents. The plot was predictable after the parents tried to ""Roast"" Lilli in the oven. I mean, come on, both parents trying to kill their child at the same time? Both psycho's? You knew the kid was going to start working on everyone involved in freeing her  from her parents.  You have had to be pretty dense not to figure out the kid was the evil one, and not the parents.

She ""kills"" some boys parents (by phoning the boy to kill them) then Emily's psychiatrist friend Bradley Cooper, then her parents (mom burned, dad stabbed in mental institution), then the cop.....................do you see where this is going? The only way to kill Lilli is while she's sleeping. Anyway, Emily kills her in the end. Case 39 CLOSED.  LOL!

4313324,2,B004B3PB74,"Although riveting, and well acted and directed, CASE 39 falls short in a few significant ways.  Playing out like an extended episode of the X-Files (without Chris Carter's gift for economical exposition), Case 39 presents yet another take on the possessed-child-from-hell scenario.  Complete with shrieks and screams, Renee' Zellweger does her best to battle with the unseen force inhabiting the little girl's body, but to no avail.

Not only does the plot challenge us to suspend our belief in even a borderline rational story, it has the Zellweger character absolutely defying logic in her decision making.  Why does she take in this child?  Why does she experience murder upon murder, yet stay with the child?  Why does she answer the frickin' phone?  Why does she think burning down her house will extinguish the evil presence?  Why does she think the evil, once escaped from the burning house, will acquiesce and stay put in a submerged automobile trunk?  Oh, I get it!!  You have to DROWN the Devil!!

While this movie is indeed suspenseful, it degenerates into yet another remake of The Exorcist, sans enough exposition to explain the genesis of the girl's possession.  Neither the nature and length of her possession, nor the extent and range of her powers are ever explained.  The director expects us to go along with the premise, content to enjoy the unbelievable ride.

In the end CASE 39 is shallow and lacks even remote believability.  Why can't the Devil ever do mundane evil things like make cheesecake taste like cow manure or cause it to rain non-stop for three months?  The dude is ALWAYS killing people.",1320019200,4,1622,4.929889298892989

4313326,3,B004B3PB74,"I wanted to see this movie based on the preview of it I saw before watching another movie. However, the preview of what the movie's about and what it's actually about are 2 different things. The basic premise is a social worker (Zellweger) gets cases of abused children and works with the families to bring them together or remove the children from the home. Then she gets an intriguing case of a little girl who's parents are very strange and almost threatening when she meets them.

She talks to the little girl who seems terrified and knows she has to get this little girl out of that house and away from her parents. One night the little girl calls her, she races over there, and something pretty horrific is taking place. Parents arrested, little girl now has nowhere to go. So Zellweger takes her in until she can be placed in a good home with a good family.

As the movie goes on, we see that the little innocent girl isn't so innocent at all. I won't say much more but the previews made this movie out to be a good paranormal type movie where a negative spirit is somehow attached to this little girl who follows her. It's not. There's definitely underlying factors and undertones but it's more of a creepy little girl we learn isn't as she seems.

It's a psychological thriller on a somewhat supernatural level and is still a decent movie. But if you want to buy it thinking you're going to see shadows, things moving on their own, strange voices, and the unseen scaring you more than what's seen.. this isn't it.",1318636800,3,1522,4.487364620938628

I found myself wondering how Emily's life would be after the movie ends: her house is burned down, she'll probably never get another job, even if she manages to stay out of prison once the police find the remains of whatever's in the car after they haul it out of the water.

It starts slow but doesn't build suspense; it simply switches gears....abruptly.  The tone, the behavior of characters, everything just changes course and it isn't subtle.  Take Ian McShane's character, one second he's a rather nasty doubting Thomas, the next, a believer.  What happened in between?  It's feels like there's a step missing.  The same holds true for Renee Zellweger's performance; she goes from bored and aloof to wildly out of control in a blink.  There are also a lot of inconsistencies in the story, too many things that don't make sense (rules of the game changed for convenience sake?).  It also doesn't help that the child makes a poor villain.  They have to resort to f/x to make her seem sinister.  In the end, she just comes across as a snotty, petulant child rather than anything truly frightening.  (Exactly what was the intent of this evil child?  It's never made clear.)

Lilith  - the name was first recorded in the Babylonian Talmud and thought to be related to a class of female demons.  (The TV Show that features Frasier also used this name for his high strung bitchy wife - Lilith).

Renee Zellweger plays Emily Jenkins,  a soft-hearted social worker that takes  Lilith into her home after seeing abusive parents try to cook her in the kitchen oven -  (This is a horrible scene - and  makes your skin creep).

But, if you have even a passing knowledge of the horror genre, you will see where ""Case 39"" is headed five minutes after the opening credits have ended.

Renee Zellweger stars as Child Protective Services agent Emily Jenkins who gets assigned a case involving a young girl. The girl's grades have fallen off drastically and she seems to have withdrawn into herself. Jenkins believe the young girl is being abused by her parents and hopes to have her placed in a foster home, and eventually the girl comes to live with Jenkins herself.

So anyone who has seen a horror film in the past 6 decades should see where this is going as soon as the little girl moves into her new home. I won't throw out any spoilers, but let's just say that ""Case 39"" follows the usual stops along this well traveled horror path, and really doesn't bring anything new to the table.

4313344,4,B004B3PB74,"I can not believe this movie is not sold at Amazon, they have all kind of obscure films but this actually have several famous actors it surprises me that you can not find it here. The movie is however easy to find other places online, perhaps then Amazon will get a clue and get it into stock.

Case 39 is about a child care social worker who are given the case of a young girl named Lillith Sullivan. The social worker Emily fears for the child's safety with her strange parents and later stops the parents from murdering Lillith. Emily wants to give the girl she just saved a safe place to recover until a permanent foster home can be found for her so she takes Lillith into her home. Soon things being to happen and innocent little Lillith turn out to be not so innocent after all, perhaps it is her parents and not Lillith who are the victims and now Emily is in danger to.

Actually the plot of Case 39 reminds me allot of a story from horror comics later made into a movie in the Masters of Horror's series named Jennifer. I am not going to go into detail about that film as if you have seen it you will know what I am talking about when you see Case 39 and if you have not seen Jennifer then I do not want to spoil it for you.

Anyway I really like Case 39. I know the movie have gotten generally bad reviews, but I enjoyed it. There is however some really big problems with the film. The phasing is all wrong, in places it is far to slow, and in other places thing are moving way to quickly. Basically up until the supernatural events begin to occur things are very slow, but once strange things start happening everything just seams to happen at once, destroying any suspense. Also I think that it is a bit strange that Emily so quickly being to think Lillith is evil, seriously most pepole will take some time to accept the supernatural as truth. Another weakness of the film is that we are never really given an explanation for what is going on, yes we are told what Lillith is, but not why she do the things she do.

However all in all I think this is a good movie. The acting is good and the general plot of the film is interesting. However if you are looking for something to scare you then this movie is not very scary, you see it for the story and the acting not for jumps and scares.",1302307200,,2300,4.173423423423423

So this thriller is about a social worker named Emily who is given a new case: a little girl who's having problems at hime and school. Her parents are strange and things don't seem right. I'll say right now that the coolest scene is when Emily sees the girl being cooked in the oven and her attempts to free her while her parents are grabbing knives and stuff.. So after all that fun, Emily ends up adopting the girl and then strange things happen, like people who are close to emily end up dying and the little girl is suddenly not sweet anymore but seems to be something not of this world.. I saw it coming from the start, thanks to the film Jennifer. What the parents of the girl were doing, now Emily ends up doing.. it's an ongoing cycle that needs to be broken.

4313346,3,B004B3PB74,"Case 39 was directed by Christian Alvart (who has since also directed and released Pandorum) and written by Ray Wright (who just released The Crazies) and I feel that his mix of director and writer actually show full well with how the movie turned out. Christian Alvart put together a very solid looking movie just as he does in Pandorum and Ray Wright has written up a great concept that I just couldn't put both of my feet solidly behind as much as I really wanted to with the concept of the film. My only complaint with Alvart's work on this is he appears to go with the scares over building up suspense and with the plot of the film I believe this was a mistake.

This story follows Emily Jenkins (Renee Zellweger,) a social worker who on a routine trip has found that a young girl Lilith (Jodelle Ferland) appears to be being abused by her parents; Edward (Callum Rennie) and Margaret (Kerry O'Malley.) I have to admit the first scene she has with meeting the couple is one of the stronger scenes in the film just with how unsettling off it was. How are you supposed to talk to a couple that reacts so indifferently to not at all to what you are saying? It is painfully obvious though that there is something wrong in this house as you can tell from every nuance of how they communicate that things are just not right.

With the conviction that Lilith is in a bad environment and is at both mental and physical risk, she goes on a crusade with her boss to try to have the child removed from their custody. Emily fails in being able to accomplish it as they smooth talk their way out of any problems when talking to her boss. After this fails we see Emily show up at Lilith's school as she is clearly concerned, gives the girl her phone number, and asking her to call if anything is to ever happen.

We flash forward to Edward and Margaret preparing to do something and Lilith calling Emily begging for help and claiming her parents are going to kill her. Lilith shows up with a police officer she is friends with and breaks in as they find the parents trying to roast the young girl alive in an oven. After a decently choreographed fight sequence we have the parents subdued and the daughter saved just in time.

From this point everything appears to be going well for the main characters. The parents are in prison, Lilith is safe, and Emily is ready to move on to the next case - until Lilith tries to be adopted by her. When she succeeds all is going well until the people that matter in Emily's life start to commit suicide or be murdered. While the first two are a bit strange it's fairly obvious to Emily quickly that something is going on. Once she starts to put together the clues that Lilith is behind it - it may be too late.
A lot of the plot felt forced and just did not work well at building up suspense. It really went for the quick thrill on each kill and didn't help to tie them in for a large build up. While the concept of how Lilith kills her victims through their greatest fears is a great concept - it was poorly executed.",1301875200,3,3048,4.304878048780488

Rene ends up rescuing the girl from parents that are attempting to Hansel and Gretel her to death. Lilith stays with Rene (Emily) until she can get a foster home. While Rene is picking up stuff at the little girl's home she notices large dead bolts on the inside of her parent's door.

The acting was superb. Jodelle Ferland was excellent, with the highlight being the scene with Rene's smug boyfriend. ""How did you answer number 12?"" Sweet.

There were no great twists in the plot, not really a surprise ending. These were really needed to distinguish this movie from other demon kid movies.

Renee Zellwiger stars as a social worker who takes in an angelic child whose parents try to kill her.  Of course, the child is not what she seems!
I enjoyed the movie--its tone starts off like a LAW AND ORDER SVU episode and then slowly takes a horror turn, and does so nicely.  Renee is fine as the tormented lead and gets good support from Bradley Cooper as her boyfriend; Ian McShane as her cop ally; Callum Keith Rennie's father, and Jodelle Ferland's devilish child.

4313361,3,B004B3PB74,"Case 39 really is an interesting case. It's an interesting case because of the way this film sat around in purgatory for three years in a state of perpetual post production. It's an interesting case because of the barrage of down right aweful reviews it received from the national media upon its initial release. I mean, this was suppose to be Bolero and Ishtar all over again. This was suppose to be a colossal dude on the scale of Patch Adams and The Waterboy. This film was supposedly so bad, that after viewing it I would have to consult a team of physicians and have my permanently tainted eyeballs donated to science, all so that they could make a preventitive pill that would save man kinds future generations. If what they where saying was true, then I would have to go on a strict regiment of diet and exercise for months on end just to survive the shock that this celluloid humiliation would inflict upon my body. Hell, their reports where so daggone dire that they had me running laps, lifting weights, and grappling a medicine ball 24-7, all so that I could build up enough endurance and constitution to stomach the utter shame that awaited me on this one diarrhea coated disc. If you think I am making this up, all you have to do is check Rotten Tomatoes to see Case 39's anemic 23% 1 star professional critic approval rating. I went into this film fully expecting to see something as unwatchable as Exorcist II The Heretic. Yet, instead of being slapped across the face with the stench of movie road kill, I was shocked to discover a rather palatable and entertaining horror movie that remained fun from start to finish. Instead of dealing with the embarrassment and disgust of another round of George Clooney Batman nipples, I found myself watching a pretty decent film with a surprisingly strong cast, visually appealing cinematography, and competent pacing, all of which prevented this film from ever becoming tedious and dull. Now, I am not about to proclaim this film as being some kind of lost misunderstood classic or anything. It is just a basic run of the mill generic evil kid from hell chiller, but as far as this kind of film goes, this one is a lot better then a lot of them out there.

Connecting the dots: Act 1. This is like deja vu all over again.

Basically you have this overworked child service case worker named Emily, played by Rene Zellweger, who's boss, played by Adrian Lester, gives her one case more then she can handle. She investigates the abused neglected girl featured in this new case and suspects that her parents might be off their collective rockers. Next she consults her boss, and her cop friend Detective Mark Barron, played by Ian McShane, deals with all the usual required red tape of institutional bureaucracy...All to make her look a little bit more like The Joan of Arc of The Child's Welfare Movement. Then out of building concern, she meets this young girl at her bus stop and supplies her with her personal cell phone number. Before you can finish microwaving a bag of popcorn, the girl calls back sounding completely frightened and asking for help. Naturally, this sends Rene Zellweger speeding off in her car on one of those 'race against time' scenes. She arrives just in a nick of time with Detective Mark Barron to save this ten year old girl from being baked in an oven by her crazed parents (Take that Little Miss. Hansel and Gretel). At first this little girl is sent to live in an orphange, but after a bit of sugary innocent kiddy begging, Emily decides to defy all the odds and adopt this precious little thing herself. Just like that, this supposedly sweet little child is safe in the bosom of Emily's modest pristine home.

Connecting the dots: Act 2. The Devil dials a cell phone.

For all of about five minutes things remain idealistic between the two of them, but then bad things start happening all around Emily. First one of the kids from a different case Emily is working on kills his parents. Then Emily's boyfriend, a child psychologist named Doug, played by Bradley Cooper, comes out of a one on one session with Emily's newly adopted daughter completely freaked out. This child had used her sinsiter forked tongue to turn the tables on Doug and make him the subject of their little psychoanalysis session. Before heading home to die under some rather crazy circumstances he let Emily know just how badly little miss Emily JR. made him feel. It is like one minute things where great and then the next Emily fully suspects her adopted daughter of being a monster and nobody will believe her. This to me is the biggest flaw of the film, because once we realized that her adopted sweetie is not a sweetie at all then the jig is up. Just ten minutes into the second act we already know that Case 39 is holding a hand full of jokers and you can take it from there. Perhapes the oddest bit of story illogic was the idea to have the devil child use a cell phone to call up the people who are going to die or kill under her influence. This must have been an oversight by the writer to involve Police Detective Mark Barron into the plot by having a traceable source he could fallow like phone records. After all, in any good paint by the numbers chiller you have to have the death of the meddling cop side character after a bit of cat and mouse foreplay. Stranger still, I just wrote a review in which a black dog, symbolic of death and famine in the old country, made a mysterious appearence. In Case 39 it's none other then a black dog that causes Detective Mark Barron's death. On a side note, I was actually attacked by a black dog myself almost a year ago to the day so there must be some kind of spooky connection here, but I'm not drunk enough right now to figure out what that might be.

Connecting the dots: Act 3. Ode to Jodelle Ferland.

Despite Case 39's predictability and all the blatant foreshadowing that continually happens in pairs, it is the cast that ultimately gives this film its passing grade. Since this story is about the mayhem caused by a rather naughtly little demon child, then it only goes to fallow that the most important member of the cast has to be that of the demon child herself. Luckily for us this roll just happens to be filled by none other then Jodelle Ferland herself. I have no idea what this young lady is like in real life, but I hear she is very girly and loves the color pink. It is just that once the script calls for her to act evil, she goes into whole nother dimension. Jodelle Ferland is so completely convincing as the demon in sheep's clothing that if I was in Emily's shoes I think I would of done all I could to form a blood pact with that little monster. I would of been all like.
"" Look here sweetie. Um, how about I give you complete run of the house, and you set it up so that I can provide us with everything we would ever need? In fact, how about you make it so that we can become filthy rich, and I will buy you your very own built in swimmin pool, a jungle gym, a hot tub, and steam room? Heck, with your super powers we could even have us our own personal cook and masseuse. In return, I will never try to poison you, and I will never ever get in your way about anything. I will always do what you want to do, and I will personally go out of my way to get you whatever you want morning noon and night. What do you say honey, do we have a deal?""
However, since this is your standard chiller, and since the cat has been out of the bag since the beginning of the second act, the story line of course calls for Rene Zellweger to do battle with Jodelle Ferland in a fight to the death. One of them will live, one of them will die, and being a crowd pleaser that wouldn't have it any other way, we already know that Rene Zellweger will come out of this victorious. Think of this kind of film like a rollercoaster, you already know where you're going to end up, but it's the getting there that's all the fun.

I was into the story at first and wondered why it got such bad reviews, but towards the end it started to totally fall apart.

4313373,3,B004B3PB74,"This is very simular to the Omen, but with Renee Zellweger. It was a weird story and I thought the little girl was good, not a demon. You will be shocked to find out that the little girl on this isn't so innocent as we have thought.",1295308800,,232,3.9574468085106385
4313374,4,B004B3PB74,"I really enjoyed this movie. It does share quite a few similarities to the movie Damien. I had never heard of this movie but it was filled with known and unknown quality actors. Lily was really creepy, uh scratch that, she was scary.",1295222400,2,233,4.441860465116279
4313375,4,B004B3PB74,"I was plesently surprised.
Something about the movie reminded me of the ""It's a Good Life""  Twilight Zone episode. [..]

The kid definately gave me the creeps.
Not the best supernatural thriller / horror flick out there, but entertaining.",1295222400,,238,5.076923076923077
4313376,5,B004B3PB74,"I liked this movie.

This movie brought to mind the short story

by Stephen King, Suffer the Children.

If you've read that, you'll have somewhat of an

idea of how to view kids like Lily.",1295136000,,188,4.285714285714286
4313377,3,B004B3PB74,"The movie starts out well, a social worker, a counselor & a police officer working together to help a child. The plot quickly turns disturbing. There's always something about evil children that just creeps you out. The performance by the actress who plays the child in this movie was wonderful. She can go from frightened, to sweet to just plain mean and they are all believable. The majority of the movie was interesting, creepy but then towards the end it quickly became predictable and it was all downhill from there. The ending definitely left me disappointed.",1295136000,,564,4.885416666666667
4313378,4,B004B3PB74,"This movie was not what I expected. The movie started off somewhat okay and then the suspense kept building. While some of the movie was predictable, there were some scenes that made you think. I would suggest this movie to any person who enjoys scary movies, social workers or anyone who let's weird little girls in their house.",1294963200,2,329,4.689655172413793
4313379,4,B004B3PB74,"Anyone even remotely familiar with the thriller genre will probably soon see what's coming here. The script could perhaps have kept us in suspense a little longer, instead of making the threat so apparent so early in the action.

Also, there are the usual lapses in logic connected with this genre. On the one hand, the problem seems as if it would be insoluble; but on the other hand, the source of the problem seems as if it might be subject to some rather prosaic restrictions.

Nevertheless, this is still a slickly-produced, well-acted thriller that delivers some truly scary moments. In the ""Making of..."" bonus feature, the movie's director says he gravitates towards material that is an exaggeration of our real fears, an exaggeration of real problems we face. That is certainly the case here. Anyone who views any of the popular TV talk/help shows will be familiar with how many families are indeed facing an all-too-real form of this horror.",1294963200,,951,4.900621118012422
4313380,5,B004B3PB74,"This movie was ridiculously scary. I hope to never see a movie like this or this movie ever again. I thought I was going to have a heart attack during the last 20-30 minutes of the movie.
However, my wife really liked the movie.",1294790400,18,228,4.204545454545454
4313381,3,B004B3PB74,"This movie was a little different than I expected. Rene Zellweger stars as a social worker named Emily Jenkins. She is given a 39th case of child abuse. The parents of Lillith Sullivan are about to burn her, but Emily stops them. Not too long after Lillith moves in with Emily, supernatural things begin to happen. I'd probably recommend CASE 39!!!",1294704000,,348,4.721311475409836
