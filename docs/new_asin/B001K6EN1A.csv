8314309,5,B001K6EN1A,"""La mujer que no tuvo infancia""  is  one of the best acted, directed, and written comedies I ever saw. Pedro Armendariz and Libertad Lamarque, in addition to being fine actors, also have crystal clear diction. I had one Spanish class in community college, before seeing this film, and was able to follow 90% of the dialogue.",1369094400,,324,4.767857142857143
