8683280,3,B00ODE8CV8,"Dina Korzun makes this film. She plays the main role, Yaya, the deaf girl. If it wasn't for her, this would be a much more ordinary movie.

The film dies when she's not in a scene.  She strikes poses like an art deco sculpture come to life (her character lives in a sculptor's studio). She has great charm; a cheeky Audrey Hepburn in the 'laughter scene'.

There are some interesting ideas, like how much our ears hear is 'noise' compared to what is truly worth listening to, plus the boyfriend's inability to live up to the ideals of his girl.  But none of these really 'live' somehow and as for the ending: a bit of a cop-out; a tad lazy I think.

I watched this film because I'm learning Russian. Yaya's diction is so clear: I learnt a few useful new words.  But whether you are interested in Russian or not, it's an entertaining film and worth watching (review by Mr. D. G.'s brother, Peter).",1245456000,4,896,4.4
8683281,4,B00ODE8CV8,"I have to admit I am biased, I speak Russian and am a huge fan of Russian movies.....but even my friends (who had to read the movie) agreed that this is a great movie. The parts of the story line resemble many popular American movies...warring Russian mafioso, gambling, realistically bad relationship choices, all culminating in a big shoot-out scene. The fact that half of the characters are deaf adds a unique twist.  Unlike it's American counterparts, you won't foresee how this is all going to end up.  However, the visuals in this movie make up for all of its short-comings....the street scenes.....especially Ya-Ya's apartment (which is more like an art gallery)....

 Don't miss this one!",1091059200,5,696,5.026086956521739
