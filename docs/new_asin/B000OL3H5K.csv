It is easy on the eyes and easy to follow, no matter the weather, for my exercise program.  THANKS!",1297123200,,243,4.239130434782608
2797194,5,B000OL3H5K,I really like the video. I was surprised that it came with three complete sessions. I own the first and was surprised that it didn't just have it as a warm up but had the complete session. I thought the third session would be harder than it is but still gave me a good workout. Seems the third works on lower body and second focuses on upper body. I love the instructor. She is great in teaching proper form.,1259625600,2,408,4.177215189873418
2797195,3,B000OL3H5K,"I bought this DVD to try to get started on the right track to weight loss.  However, I found it hard to follow.  The instructor had already changed her move before she instructs the viewer to do so.  Then it is hard to catch up with the right rhythm when you are two beats behind.  She keeps counting before you get a chance to change.  Maybe if you do it every day and memorize the routine, you could be able to do it without screwing up and getting behind, but for beginners its not all that great.
I find the ""Crunch"" fitness DVD's to be the best as far as instruction goes.  They tell you which side to start on, left or right, and how many counts you will do before you even start counting.  I think I'll list this DVD back on amazon.com for sale since its not working out for me.",1259625600,2,785,4.091503267973856
2797196,4,B000OL3H5K,"I bought this DVD years ago when I first joined weight watchers and still use it now.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is looking for a really intense workout, I do 'Get Fit!' (the hardest section) and find it a high intermediate workout at most.  But I enjoy it for lighter days or when I don't have a ton of time because it's only 30 minutes.

This DVD pairs cardio with sculpting and while I find the cardio a little below my level I really like the muscle/free weight sections.  The cardio has the best cueing I've ever seen in a workout DVD with the instructor showing and explaining each move extremely well.  Also the instructor is encouraging without being obnoxious and over-the-top.  The DVD also includes a warm up and a cooldown section which I find above average.  The warm-up is totally adequate and I feel ready to start when it's done.  I like the cooldown but I don't think it includes quite enough stretching and I usually stretch out about 10 minutes on my own afterward.  But it does accomplish a gradual lowering your heart rate which I like.

Overall, I definitely recommend buying this as a beginning excersier (especially since it allows you to grow and up the workout over time) or for a lighter intensity day if you're more advanced.",1246492800,,1266,4.561946902654867
2797197,5,B000OL3H5K,"I bought this video in my earlier Weight Watcher days a few years back and I still love it. I got away from it for a while (about a year), but am back using it at least once a week for the last month or so (I alternate with other videos and jogging). There are 3 easy to follow videos that are 3 different intensity levels. All use free weights - whatever works for you - or no weights if you're really a beginner.  The 3rd workout (Get Fit) is what I use most - it never gets boring, just up the weight and it's suddenly a challenge again. I love that the workouts are with actual WW members - at least mostly WW members - I'm a little leery about the blonde in the back :)
  What I really love is that they tell you the activity points values unlike the newer videos they have put out. I would recommend it to anyone who can still find this video to get it.",1231113600,9,859,3.953757225433526
2797198,5,B000OL3H5K,"Price was right, delivery was EXCELLENT, and I'm satisfied with the product.
I'll order again!",1221782400,,94,5.333333333333333
2797199,5,B000OL3H5K,"The ""Get In Shape"" is the exception to my rule and it really gets me up and moving.

It is great as it covers all intensity levels and even the very unfit can do the low intensity level.  It's also great that each disc is only 30 mins so even if you feel like skipping the excercise, you can tell yourself, ""I'll be done with this in 30 mins""  It's really doable and fun.

When you are ready you can move up a level and the instructor is really nice.  The girls in the back are great too.

I really recommend this disc set if you are unfit and you don't know where to start.",1218499200,4,574,3.9478260869565216
2797200,5,B000OL3H5K,"This is the 3 Pack to get! There is a variety to choose from with each work out being of a different intensity level. You are moving but not becoming breathless. This might be too easy for work out devotees but when you want to move but not exhaust yourself, this is what you need!!! I have been working out to one tape every day for the past 3 weeks and can see a big difference in my body. It gets the job done!",1199750400,8,413,3.9285714285714284
2797201,5,B000OL3H5K,i SIMPLY LOVE THIS DVD!!!Although you may out grow it it is great! The cueing is awesome the instructor keeps you moving and has A great attitude! The others working out with her are awesome also. You will only need weights with this workout and it is aerobics with some squats that burn!(in the hardest workout).I love the step kick in the warm-up. The warm-up and cool-down are very good. You will be able to follow easier and harder moves as two of the ladies perform variations. I also love how it is divided into chapters to where you don't have to do the entire 30 minutes if you don't want to. Try it!,1193097600,20,608,4.342105263157895
2797202,5,B000OL3H5K,I like this workout DVD.There are 3 different classes to choose from. It is fun and lively.,1434326400,,91,4.411764705882353
2797203,4,B000OL3H5K,"I am coming back from a really bad fitness year, so I am on the lookout for workouts that are on the easier side without being boring and/or lame. And, I really enjoy these workouts. There are three workouts on this DVD, all around 30 minutes. They are all circuit-type workouts, alternating segments of aerobics with light weight work. The three levels of intensity are:

Get Started! - marketed as a light intensity workout - very light beginner workout
Get Moving! - marketed as a moderate intensity workout - I'd put it at a high beginner level
Get Fit! - marketed as a high intensity workout - I'd put it as a solid, but not high, intermediate workout

Nancy Popp, the instructor, is backed up by a group of Weight Watchers members and one group leader. At various points during the workout, Nancy takes a break from the action and asks one of them a question - about her background, her weight loss, what she thinks about Weight Watchers, etc. Some of the answers were inspirational. Some were such ads for Weight Watchers that I laughed out loud. All sounded scripted. However, these exercisers do get into the moves and you have various people to follow with different styles and levels of intensity. There is a modifier who is pretty good, once in awhile its like she doesn't understand that she's doing a move that needs modification, but most of the time she does fine. Nancy was my favorite instructor from the 10Minute DVD she appeared on and I enjoy her style here. She does come across as stiff sometimes and doesn't always cue on time, but she also leads some fun workouts that put together standard moves in a fun way.",1424822400,,1635,4.595890410958904

2797208,3,B000OL3H5K,"If you are a less-than-agile woman who wants to start out easy and slowly work your way into an aerobic exercise routine this is for you. (I'm sure a man could use it, too, but it's designed for women.)

Pros:
- Easy exercises are graduated, so you can work your way from very low impact to not-so-low impact
- The people in the videos look pretty normal, so you don't have to compare yourself to acrobatic super models

Cons:
- The three videos are only 45min. long, so you may tire of them quickly
- The exercises are these kind of silly ""dance moves"" (but hey, if silly dance moves will get you moving that's great)

So, if you want something very non-threatening that will get you out of your chair and moving around, this may be the thing for you.",1409702400,2,752,4.319148936170213
2797209,5,B000OL3H5K,I thought I was going to be extremely dissapointed with this workout dvd but it was the total opposite. It get you moving and if you are limited  physical this is a good option. I suffer from extreme arthritis of the knee and this workout doesn't put preasure on my knee. It makes me want more. The instructor is great and she makes you break a sweat.,1402617600,,351,4.2388059701492535

2797211,4,B000OL3H5K,"Somehow I broke my old DVD, so I replaced it immediately.  I have many other workout DVD's but always come back to this one.  Have been using it for nearly 10 years, and I am keeping my goal weight and going strong at 82.  There are three levels of intensity, so anyone who can stand up to exercise should be able to enjoy it.  I just wish I could keep the music and mute the chatter, which I have memorized after all these years.",1387929600,,430,4.083333333333333
2797212,4,B000OL3H5K,"I purchased this to replace an old VHS tape of the same product. Even the high intensity workout isn't a super hard workout so this isn't for someone who is a high intensity exerciser.  I've had a couple of surgeries that have limited my exercise and I like being able to pick and choose between low, moderate, or high intensity depending on how I feel.
I also like the circuit training approach. I think the cool down could use a bit more hip flexor and leg stretching and less walking back and forth but I've used these workouts off and on for a number of years and they meet my needs.",1369872000,,587,4.288288288288288

2797214,5,B000OL3H5K,"I am 65 and a retired educator.  Even though I was fairly active my entire life, my sedentary job took a toll on my physical fitness and gave me stressed, compressed discs in my lower back. After months of therapy,  I began watching and following this Get in Shape DVD with a friend about two years ago.  We began with the Level 1 and have advanced to the Level 3.  I also do yoga exercises 2-3 times a week.  I have since been able to rejoin my husband in rigorous sports, such as tennis and pickleball with general ease.  The Get in Shape's low impact system is wonderful and seems to work miracles for me!",1364601600,3,608,4.243478260869566

2797216,1,B000OL3H5K,"I just experienced my first WW exercise DVD. I HATED it. I have been a musician since I was 5 and this DVD drove me crazy. There is no coordination between the exercise motions and the rhythm of the rather laid-back music. I found myself, time after time, slowing my pace to the rhythm of the music. Other exercise DVDs can ""keep the beat."" I will go back to them until WW can get their act together!",1357516800,2,400,4.207792207792208

2797220,5,B000OL3H5K,These DVD's are great. For the longest I have the VHS. They provide a quick and results oriented work out. I was able to get out of bed in the morning complete a workout and get ready for work. I was truly trying to avoid gyms and having to do something afterwork. I started and progressed through the DVD seriews in the privacy of my own home! I have recently ordered another set to give a gift.,1323129600,2,396,4.1558441558441555
2797221,5,B000OL3H5K,"This video I bought on line and it has all 3 workouts on the same video.  It is a great motivator and it's nice to see the success that the actual WW members have had on the WW program.  It took me awhile to get to level 3, but it's worth it.  When I can't get to the gym and too cold to walk outside, it is the greatest thing to put the video on and just move!  You can even add more moves to the video if it's not challenging enough by raising your arms, using heavier weights or putting more bounce into your workout.
It makes you feel very virtuous when you can finish 2 of them without a problem.",1298764800,,601,3.901639344262295
