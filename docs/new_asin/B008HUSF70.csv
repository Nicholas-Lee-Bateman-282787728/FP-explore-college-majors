5165535,4,B008HUSF70,"I remember, when playing Mass Effect 3, Lieutenant Vega telling this story to Commander Shepherd. Not Until I saw this movie did I understand what sort of weight Vega carried on his shoulders and now respect the character much more.

A Few criticisms first; The animation is not the best. The Krogan all look like their pet Varrens. There are several inconsistencies with the video game, (Like 10 ft. Tall Collectors). Also Vega notes his squad all dies, which they do, I just wish they could've developed more so the view could care when this person dies. (They try and you feel a little weight with some characters, I'm just saying they could've done more.)

They story is well written and the Bioware Humor is there, but in little doses. Where the Movie shines is at the end when you know the choice has to be made and you feel the anxiety and pain Vega feels in that moment. I myself wondered if I was in that spot, if I would've done the same thing, which is what I think the Movie want's it's viewers to think. And The Voice acting was great, the actors didn't just show up to collect paychecks. You can feel the emotion in every word spoken. Freddie Prinze Jr. does a great job as Vega and probably found himself a new career in Voice acting (Since he never really had a Movie career, other then that one Scooby-doo movie).

The Mediocre animation and silly inconsistencies can be overlooked by the emotion and the great story. I give this movie a Full Recommendation for anyone interested in the Mass Effect universe.",1357171200,2,1525,4.538181818181818
5165536,5,B008HUSF70,"Having watched this movie through a full three times now... I'd still rather not give much away and ruin what is special about it for other people watching. It's well acted/voiced, well animated. I enjoyed the music. I very much enjoyed the importance of choice. Yes, you're a passive viewer. You don't actually make the choice, but it's powerful.

There are a couple of nice videos to watch in the extras section. The main event is definitely worth the price of admission, here. Check it out.",1356912000,,493,4.732558139534884
5165537,5,B008HUSF70,"While Paragon Lost is animated and features characters other than Commander Shepard, the story fits great between Mass Effect 2 and 3. The plot is great in regards to the Mass Effect universe and fills in a few gaps/questions about James Vega. It also includes choices that make the Mass Effect games so compelling and exciting, and makes you truly understand where the characters are coming from.

I don't write many reviews, but as a Mass Effect fan I strongly recommend this! (And would love to see another movie in the future from Bioware!)",1356652800,,544,4.787234042553192
5165538,2,B008HUSF70,Decent animation but the execution of a Saturday morning cartoon. Cliche after cliche and unnecessary plugs to the game characters. Cheesy...Spend less money on voice actors and more on writing.,1356566400,3,194,5.5
5165539,3,B008HUSF70,"Overall a solid work that attempts to match-up with the ME series, but some glaring canonical missteps and thematic inconsistencies cause this movie to seem to just not ""fit"" with the Mass Effect ethos.
There is a reality in this movie that I could not get out of my head:  The art direction seems off and the tone is too muddy.

As far as the art, it looks like early ninja turtles-esque shading and angles are drawn from a casual observer/fly-on-the-wall perspective.  This detracts from the goal of the ME series/story line due the story seeming impersonal and I was not drawn in due to this.

With regard to tone, I didn't feel for the character because they, at no point, relate to the viewer, but only to each other.  ME has been widely based on drawing it's audience in by putting them in Shepard's shoes and looking at the world through his eyes.  Each choice (which was the focused theme of the movie) mattered.  In this work, I just don't care what James chooses because he is choosing it for others who are only lightly developed characters.

I struggled with the tone of choice.  When you make choices and are forced to live with the assumptions you make choices (see ME video game, movies like Memento or Fight Club ect) that matter to the story, to yourself and to those around you.  Attempting to show how choice ""matters"" by showing how it happened for this group at this time from a distance is not only poor story telling, but it's not in keeping with the feel, tone and structure of the series.

Humble suggestion:  Show the whole film through the eyes of one character who is given a gender neutral name (silent protagonist) who is under James command.  Then have that person making decisions based on the most likely choices for the best outcome, have some of those choices backfire and result in a mixed message of hope, struggle and the honorable achievement of the group.  This can drive the theme home and keep in line with the series and makes it accessible to everyone.

That is but one way to do it and I am sure there are many other ways to get this kind of product out there.  I guess my take-away is that I felt the film didn't do the creativity and effort put into the game(s) justice.  Not that this would be horrible as a stand alone title, but taking a look at the whole picture of the Mass Effect cannon, there is a lot to be desired in this film.",1356566400,2,2383,4.428899082568807
5165540,3,B008HUSF70,"The movie kept me entertained but didn't wow me in any way. The Mass Effect timeline is all out of wack in the movie too. The bring Vega in with a patch from his time with the Normandy and Shepard is dead, yet 2 years later from that point are the events leading up to Mass Effect 2 (Vega came along in ME3 way after any of this supposed timeline). Also a lot of stuff from the first Mass Effect game rehashed with different characters and you know what is going to happen since it starts to follow the storyline of Mass Effect 2. For quite a long time you really feel like the writer should have just swapped out Vega for Ashley since it is basically the same exact thing but with a different person. Same for the name of the planet. Some of the lore is wrong too.",1355875200,,765,4.1066666666666665
5165541,5,B008HUSF70,"Perhaps as a testament to the game studios quality, Mass Effect anime stands leagues above the quality offered by Dragon Age. Better visuals and better character designs and what not. I could easily see myself being excited to rewatch this over say Dawn of the Seeker. Overall was a good and enjoyable anime at least for the sake of action and space sci fi stuff. Fehl Prime was when it got really intense for the Delta Squad (their first skirmish against the Blood Pack was a good introduction too). Some of the details and stuff did require some knowledge of mass effect lore I guess (Prothean Stuff, Reaper Stuff, Shepard stuff), but otherwise stands well on its own and hey an appearance by Liara T'Soni The story ended up being quite intense at times, bloody.

I liked the characters here (better looking than most characters in the game), easily my favorite was Essex, perhaps cause hes biotics but he has best design.

The other characters in Delta Squad are really good, Nicky (tech guy of sorts), Milque (sniper) all interacted well with the others like Kamille (though she had attitude issues) as well as the Asari, Treeya.

(Ending Spoiler)
Major dissatisfaction at the ending So many deaths on my gosh, I mean, anyone I became a fan of ended up meeting such a tragic fate, almost was glad Essex got all the epic action scenes and stuff but then bam, ouch. Worst yet the ending itself, sacrifice everyone for the sake of the Asari, what even, why would you do that, the data not even necessary. Ugh. Vega didn't even do nothing special beyond make decisions, kind of useless.
(End Spoiler)

Liked the visuals, the one from the opening hyped me up, I just love the relay and all the biotics stuff, as well as the map displays. The music was good too fitting well within the franchise. I do not think mass effect has never has bad musics. Soundwise, I miss Hatchett Out moments though and EDI.

Overall a good BD/DVD set to have and 45 minutes of extras is worth it, much better than what is usually offered by anime companies. Disc art is a bit lacking as it not really artsy, and they could have put the music video of the ending song here, but definitely worth the 19 or so dollars and 1080p glory.",1355875200,9,2210,4.542713567839196
5165542,4,B008HUSF70,"I downloaded Paragon Lost on my Playstation, and I thought it was pretty decent.  I was happy they got Freddy Prinze to add his voice, although neither Keith David or Lance Henrikkson reprised their roles as Cpt. Anderson and Adm. Hackett.  I enjoyed the humor and action, and was impressed with their uses of so many of the weapons we love from the game.  I think any true fan will enjoy seeing the backstory of one of our favorite (though sadly not romanceable) characters.  I enjoyed it, and I think you will too.",1355788800,4,516,4.516129032258065
5165543,4,B008HUSF70,"I have only seen the movie itself at a premier event at Anime Weekend Atlanta. It was very enjoyable and seemed to keep both the humor and the seriousness of the games intact. I have only seen the English audio version, which was actually not painful to watch for a change. Voice acting was the quality I would like to see in more animation titles.

If you're a huge ME fan and have played at least 1 and 2, then this is a perfect transition into 3. I personally wouldn't mind seeing a series made from this (start after the movie, not remake it).

As I haven't had seen any of the special features, I can't comment on those.",1349395200,38,625,4.243697478991597
5165564,3,B008HUSF70,Unbiased opinion. The dialogue is lacking and corny at times. There are moments where it all works but in the end it doesn't leave you wanting more.,1483920000,,148,4.518518518518518

5165567,3,B008HUSF70,"I agree with most people on here.  The story of Mass Effect: Paragon Lost was relatively decent, nothing new but nothing bad either.  However, the animation just doesn't fit within the Mass Effect universe.  I'm not sure what the big fetish with anime is nowadays.  Halo used it and now Mass Effect.  It's fine for the stories it's meant to portray, but when compared to the games, Mass Effect and anime just don't seem to go together particularly well.  I think it would've been so much better with different animation and an overall feel.  Because it seems with anime comes cheesy one-liners and bad, over-the-top voice acting.  The cheesy parts didn't ruin the movie for me, it was just a little distracting at times because that type of stuff wasn't in the game.  And that's what we all know and love.  In addition, I wish they would've given Vega a little more personality because we're supposed to care for this guy and what he's going through.  Overall, it wasn't horrible, it just could've been better.  Hopefully the next animated film, series, or live action movie stays closer to the game in regards to character personalities, action, and feel.",1466640000,,1156,4.782828282828283

5165569,3,B008HUSF70,"What can I say that hasn't been criticized about Paragon Lost already? I do have both positive and negative things to say about it, and all in all, it's not the worst adaptation I've ever seen. It's truer to Mass Effect than the live action Resident Evil movies are to their games. I know that's not the best comparison, but it's the first one that came to me.

THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS
But if you've spoken to James in Mass Effect 3, you already know how it ends, because he tells you all about it.

THE POSITIVES
1) Freddie Prince, Jr. returns as the voice of James, which was actually a pleasant surprise. It's always cool to hear a voice actor you became familiar with in your favorite game series appear in an adaptation. Through the whole thing, I was able to believe, ""Yup, that's James"" whenever he spoke.

2) Vague, though interesting references to Commander Shepard, a character we never see (for obvious reasons), but James admires immensely. However, these references work much better if the Shepard you played was a Paragon, as James is, well, a Paragon himself, hence the reason for the movie's title. There's a joke one of the ancillary, pointless characters says in regards to Vega's Shepard-worship: ""Sucks for you that Shepard's dead. You two would have made a really cute couple."" This made me crack a smile, because it's a joke that works for BOTH genders of Shepard.

However, other references of Shepard suggest that Shepard is a princess-saver trope, and that irked me quite a bit. And no, it was not meant to be funny or ironic. They actually said that ""Saving the girl and saving the galaxy"" was a page from the ""Shepard Handbook."" Yeah, saving the galaxy certainly is in the ""Shepard Handbook,"" but when does he ever ""save the girl""? As we all know, there is certainly more than one ""girl"" in the games, and most of them DON'T need rescuing (unless you count Bakara). That's why they work for Shepard to begin with: they're strong soldiers and fighters. This remark implies that Shepard is not only canon MALE, but the kind of male that fits into a stereotype.

So what if your male Shepard was gay? What if your female Shepard was straight? ""Saving the girl"" (which has an underlying implication of also ""winning the girl for your prize when you save the day"") would be a pretty silly thing to say if either of these things were the case for you. Shepard is what the player makes of him or her, so comments like that kind of ruin a player's ""image"" of their particular hero. In all fairness, this could have been a blanket statement about Shepard's heroics and not entirely meant to portray a particular type of character, although a simple ""do a million favors for everyone and still find time to pull the galaxy out of the fire"" would have fit him/her better, honestly.

Still, just hearing his/her name in the movie, and to see that Shepard's reach was pretty far, and everyone knows who he/she is, was pretty fun. That Normandy badge James wears was quite touching. It gave him a little more character. So this is a minor complaint.

3) Speaking of character, this movie builds upon James' a lot more than the game does. Although James does talk to Shepard in the game (if you actually bother to talk to him about things) about exactly what occurred in the film, you still get to see James' choices firsthand, and you get to know him better in ways the game doesn't let you. It's the kind of thing that the games should have more of: developed relationships by discussing past history of the characters. Because you learn more about James in the movie, you feel like you know him better, and you're less likely to say ""Eh, no,"" when it comes time to pick him for your squad in ME3.

4) Liara makes a brief cameo. I don't know if it's the same voice actor, but it does sound a lot like her otherwise.

5) The title. Kind of clever, actually.

THE NEGATIVES
1) The lore inconsistencies.
  a) Collectors are for some reason two stories tall and a human is small enough to fit IN THEIR HAND.

  b) Biotics for some reason need ""power cells"" in order to be able to use their abilities. In the games, biotics have neural implants, and biotic abilities are the result of exposure to element zero. This clearly was not researched, and thus it makes me feel like they didn't give a damn.

  c) One of the humans (no, I don't remember the other marines' names, because there was no reason to) wears glasses. This needn't be mentioned to Mass Effect fans, but glasses are sort of obsolete in the games. There's a lot of technology, and I'm sure eye care has advanced quite a bit. And the fact that they had to put glasses on one of them to point out ""look, he's the nerdy tech one!"" is pretty cheap.

  d) James gets accepted for the N7 program at the end of the film, when actually he enrolls halfway through Mass Effect 3 and even asks for Shepard's advice about it. I guess it's possible that James chose not to enroll until he had the chance to speak to Shepard, but the way he spoke of it on the Normandy suggested that he had no idea it was happening until very recently.

  e) ---SPOILERS--- In the game, James tells Shepard, ""I picked the intel"" during a chat with him about his past in Normandy's shuttle bay. While that is... KIND OF true in the film, the movie makes it seem like he, in fact, picked the damsel-in-distress over the colony, NOT the intel. This... bothered me. I liked the idea that James sacrificed a lot in order to obtain some information. Not that he sacrificed a lot to save one single asari. That actually makes it seem a lot less realistic to me, because that intel was pretty important to the Alliance, and James is pretty loyal to the Alliance. Wasn't that intel enough for him to sacrifice for? Why did a love interest have to be carrying it?

  f) ---SPOILERS--- A bracelet that can record leagues of prothean and collector data. Uh, isn't that what omni-tools are for? Where did he get that bracelet? Why does he have it? Is it a cheap, generic knock-off of the omni-tool? Like a poor man's version, or something? This ""bracelet"" is what becomes the ""intel"" that James requires. Already you can see that having the intel on this ""bracelet"" makes it easier for someone else to physically take the intel, and in this case, it happens to be the damsel-in-distress. This is so that in order for James to save the INTEL, he must also save the PRINCESS-- uhh, I mean, Treeya.
No bracelets like this exist in the Mass Effect universe otherwise.

2) If it's not already clear by now, the side characters are pointless. They are one dimensional cannon fodder used only to have someone for James to talk to other than himself. What's more is that they're not only Western cliches, but anime ones as well. It's a perfect storm of bad design. I get that there wasn't really enough time to develop all of them in the way that characters are developed in the games, but that's all the more reason they shouldn't have existed.

---SPOILERS---That little girl that James was friends with was such forced heartstring-tugging. She was there to act cute to get you to care about the colony, because James sacrificing tons of adults wouldn't be bad enough, apparently. There just had to be a little girl there, because no one would go so far as to kill a whole colony that has one little girl in it! THE OUTRAGE!

The worst offender is the love interest/damsel-in-distress/plot device Treeya, the only asari in the film (save for Liara's cameo). I call her NotLiara, because that's basically what she is: Liara with a different name. And she's barely even that. At least Liara had a personality. Treeya does not. She says Liara is her ""mentor"", which I think is a handy excuse to not give her any character of her own. ""Just make her a Liara knockoff and say Liara taught her stuff."" Her only purpose is revealed at the very end of the movie, which should be obvious to you by now.
Let's just say that the movie ended in a completely opposite way that I envisioned when James talked about it in ME3.

3) Anime was not the best choice of art style for something like Mass Effect, and that's despite the fact that sci-fi anime is definitely a thing. However, Mass Effect isn't very ""anime"" by design in the games. Everything is very technical, explained thoroughly (for the most part) and even biotics have a lot of reasoning behind them. Anime focuses a lot on ""super ninja powers"" where people do flips, kicks and jumps in the manner that no normal human could do. Yes, humans do utilize biotics in Mass Effect, but non-biotics were doing superhuman jumps in this movie. It was... silly.

Furthermore, anime in general is not a very attractive animation style to begin with. I know a lot of people disagree, but I never really enjoyed the way it looked. Anime always has a ""cheap"" feel to it in my opinion, and while some animes are done far better than others, it's a style that just doesn't look very good when it comes to portraying Mass Effect. It would have fared better done in a Western comic book style (like the Batman cartoons perhaps), or even in CG. When done in anime, it gives the illusion that it's animated poorly. I've seen plenty of other animes that looked just as bad as this, so it doesn't come as much of a surprise. Although when you compare something like this to, say, The Animatrix short films based on The Matrix movies, you can truly see how much farther and better they could have gone with it if time was spent on it.

With that said, it could look worse. But it could look a hell of a lot better. Every time I saw a krogan in the film, it had me cracking up with how ridiculous it looked. Especially from the front angle. Don't get me started on how hilariously stupid the vorcha looked. And vorcha don't exactly look all that intelligent to begin with.

4) While James sounds like James... he looks NOTHING like the game version of James. The only saving grace is his haircut. And even that can be off at times. I didn't think it'd be possible for them to make him into an even larger beefcake than he is in the game, but the size of his neck and chin says anything is possible.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Paragon Lost could be a lot worse than it is. For those who love Mass Effect, I actually do recommend it, as while it isn't as faithful as we might have liked, it's still fun enough to watch just to get to know James. If you pretend the other characters aren't even there, it makes for a better film. I especially recommend this if James was a ""best bud"" or love interest to your Shepard in ME3, because seeing him idolize Shepard in those two cases does make you appreciate him as Shepard a lot more.",1465257600,,10674,4.481710458526533

Finally, the animation is boring and unremarkable.

Now at this point I'd typically say that fans of the game may wish to add a star or two, but based on perusing the other reviews, I have my doubts.  The harshest reviews appear to come from disappointed gamers, complaining about mistakes.

Too bad.  This could have been an exciting introduction to the world of Mass Effect for newbies and a gift for fans.  Instead it is a depressing, downbeat bore that will send newbies away and infuriate fans with its mistakes and cheap look compared to the game.",1455408000,2,1875,7.192982456140351

5165593,2,B008HUSF70,"Ultimately I would say this movie was better than I thought it was going to be, but only because I'd only heard overwhelmingly negative things about it, and therefore went into this movie with low expectations.

The only really good part of the film was Vega's character.  It certainly expanded on who he was, and makes his character in Mass Effect 3 more interesting.  The problem with this is Vega was already interesting enough.  If you talk to Vega throughout the game you learn that his personality was largely for show, hiding a deeply conflicted and traumatized man.  I get why most players deride him, I did at first too but he's genuinely interesting.  At least he's better than Jacob.  That said, it was a little strange for the game, in it's third and final installment, to introduce a brand new character rather than bringing back one of the Mass Effect 2 companions, but I digress.

My biggest critique is all of the other characters.  All of them are one-dimensional, used to show facets of Vega's personality rather than being characters unto themselves.  Some of them have interesting things happen to them, but they are not interesting by themselves.  They were part of the reason I didn't like this movie.  I didn't care about them, and I knew what would happen to the colony because I played Mass Effect 3, and I knew who Vega would become, so it was hard for me to really be invested in what was happening on the screen.

I also didn't care for the little girl.  I feel like she was there to make Vega, and the audience, care about what happens to the colonists.  Thing is, Vega should have cared about them anyway, and would've even if the little girl wasn't there.  I can't articulate it well-enough, but it seems kinda cheap to me.

This last one is really subjective, but I couldn't stand the art style.  I'm not sure if Paragon Lost is indicative of all anime, and I'm not a huge fan of anime, having seen only a couple of the really big names, but I found it lacking.  Maybe it's just the fact that they have 2D animation interspersed with horrible CG.  I'm a big fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender (and it's sister show, The Legend of Korra), which is a western take on anime (or at least I've heard it described as such) but the animation in that show is just better.  Maybe the studio that animated Paragon Lost just didn't have the time, money, or inclination to put out a well-animated product.  I can't exactly point to a single instance where I thought the animation was poorly done, the whole film just seems kinda discordant to me.  It's probably just my lack of familiarity with anime, but I felt the same thing when I saw those terrible Dead Space films, which were done in a similar style to Paragon Lost.

All that said, I don't regret watching this film, or spending 3 dollars to rent it.  It was enjoyable for what it was, but I kept hoping it would rise above to a better level of story-telling.  It didn't, but that's okay.  That said, if you aren't a fan of Mass Effect, I wouldn't recommend this film.  I mean, even if it was a good film it would be weird to watch it having never played Mass Effect.  That'd be like reading one of the novels or comics without having played the game.  You just wouldn't have the context to really understand what's happening.",1438646400,,3303,4.484087102177554
5165604,1,B008HUSF70,"Compared to features such as The Animatrix and Gotham Knight,  this is the biggest piece of crap ever.  The poorly animated characters look very out of place on the CGI background.  The video game itself has WAY better graphics than this movie.  I think StarFox 64 has better graphics than this movie, maybe even Super Star Fox for the SNES.  The story line is extremely juvenile, lacking in depth and nuance -- it is a huge system shock if you are a fan of the video games.  The Krogans (my favorite race) look like ugly space mutants and act in no way reminiscent of the their beloved namesake.

5165605,4,B008HUSF70,"I was very cautious going into this movie. I'm not a super fan though I do love the series I've only played through the trilogy twice and I loved it. That's the best I can do as far letting you know how invested I am in the ME universe. Anyways, I just finished watching the film 5 minutes ago, here are my thoughts as spoiler free as possible.

Pros:
Vega was imo an pretty forgettable character in ME3, even talking to him as much as possible and hearing a bit of backstory I was unimpressed and pretty much never took him on a mission, this movie changed that COMPLETELY for me. He is 100x more interesting after watching this movie.

Animation is pretty good quality.

Good voice acting, dialogue was on the cheesy side but not horrible.

The overall story is pretty intriguing and the last 20 min or so had me riveted.

Neutrals:
It's anime and with that comes a unique look to the fighting, designs and movement in this movie that doesn't necessarily reflect the work created in the game.

A cameo or 2 of some characters you know from the game are in the film.

Cons:
There are some pretty big inconsistencies between how things work in this film compared to the game.

For some reason they have batteries or charge cells or something in order to use biotics but no way to measure how much energy any certain thing takes. Some of the biotic moves in the film aren't really moves in the game.

Some of the scenes someone was so violently destroyed in a fight that I thought for sure they were dead with the amount of blood involved but they would be limping and mostly fine in the next scene.

For some reason medi-gels are non existent here.

Some of the weapons in the film don't exist in the game.

Some of the enemy collectors seem to be completely made up or altered in a way that is inconsistent with the game and will leave you wondering why and how they did something. As someone pointed out in another review towards the end of the movie the collectors are like 2 stories tall and Vega is like ninja jump shooting them anime style.

TL;DR
The film is definitely worth watching if you have at least beat Mass Effect 2, it tells you a ton about why Lt. Vega is the way he is and some of the hard decisions he made and how he idolized Shepard. In my next play through I could see myself bring him along a lot and that's entirely because of this movie, you really feel for the guy by the end and it's a well fleshed out backstory.",1436745600,,2441,4.291938997821351

5165612,2,B008HUSF70,"The movie will probably appeal to hardcore fans of the game and completionists. I think there was an opportunity here for a solid entertaining action piece, but I don't think they delivered. The theme of making hard choices, perhaps ones that you have to live with the rest of your life is the strongest part of this movie and perhaps the only good part. Visually character designs are only ok with Asari anthropologist Treeya in my opinion being the only standout. Character animation on the other hand was stiff not really fluid and the 3D computer graphics at times stood out like an eyesore. I thought the voice actors had good appealing voices and fit their characters. However, I found the script dialogue to sound awkward, sometimes cliched and overall weak. The story is serviceable and follows a standard introductory action setup to get us acquainted with the characters before the larger storyline hits.

Frankly, I'm surprised at the mediocre visual quality. This was supposedly animated by Production I.G. and they have done better work incorporating 3D graphics in other projects and overall more attractive work. As far as a movie I don't recommend it as a blind-purchase if you aren't already a fan of the games. You may find yourself a little lost and not get how some of this ties in with the games. In conclusion it may be fun for hardcore fans, but it may not be fun enough to casual fans nor will it make someone whose first experience is this movie rush out to buy and play the games.

People complain about the animation, but I'm just glad a Mass Effect animated film was made! There are some inconsistencies in this film with the game, but I didn't fret over it.

Where Vega had to make just one decision, Shepherd had to make many more. Vega learns that the life Shepherd has is not as glorious as it seems, and he respects Shepherd for that, because someone else has had to make tough choices as well.",1395532800,,656,4.429752066115703

5165667,2,B008HUSF70,"Renting this on a whim... very glad I didn't buy this outright.

If you are a ME fan/ completionist, check this out. It is essentially the background story behind James Vega, the seemingly random team member addition you have in Mass Effect 3, and for the most part it is a serviceable storyarc, with a few glaring plotholes that deride the story. However, it is nice that the movie does emphasize the core aspect of Mass Effect being a story that depends heavily on making hard choices and living with them (disregarding the massive ME3 ending blunder).

As for the rest of the movie, I really cannot recommend much of anything. For one, the animation is lackluster, and downright atrocious in some parts. None of the character models are anyway interesting and it feels like the animation team really had no idea on how to handle James, Further, it also feel like said animation team wasn't speaking to each other in some parts, with glaring changes in plot and character builds (ie- in some scenes the Collectors are depicted as normal sized, then in the next, they're 15-20 foot giants).

And one more gripe I would have, which I think is mostly due to outright laziness, is the lack of an extensive cast of species that Mass Effect is known for. You have your humans, one Asari, a handful of Vorcha, and two, maybe three Krogans. No Turians, Salarians, Batarians or even Volus. This might seem trivial, but to put it in other words- to try and have a Mas Effect story without even a signle Turian is kind of like trying to have a Lord of the Rings story without any elves. It's possible... but their absence in quite glaring.

So... it's an okay rental. I however cannot recommend buying it unless you HAVE to have everything ME related.",1394668800,3,1742,4.609677419354838
5165668,3,B008HUSF70,"Okay, this is not up to the quality of the games themselves, but I don't know that it would be fair to judge it that way.

The animation style is ... well, generic is probably the best way I can put it.  Older anime (the original Record of Lodoss War, the Sunrise Dirty Pair, Ranma 1/2, Science Ninja Team Gatchaman) all were very distinct in style and tone.

This seems very generic, compared to them.  That might be animation on the cheap, or simply the new style.  No points for it, no strikes against it.  It just wasn't breathtaking animation.

Storywise, you know going in what is going to happen with Vega and the colony (again, spoilers from ME3, Vega tells you he sacrificed the colony to get information on the Collectors, which your character rendered useless because you likely destroyed the Collector Base and the Collectors).

Vega's squad is pretty generic, you've seen these characters before.  You have your flashy showoff, a no-nonsense type, a brainy type, etc.

Same with the idea behind the colonists.  Of COURSE there is a cute little girl and her mom.  No romance there (no, Vega seems interested in someone else), but you know they will wring pathos out of the little girl, right?

I will say this, part of the reason it seems Vega did what he did really didn't ring true for me.  In making his choice to save the information collected on the Collectors, it appears he also might have done it for more of a self-serving reason (to save the Asari woman he seems interested in).

I don't know if that was supposed to make the decision MORE complex, or more suspect, but it did strike me odd.

It's a nice little diversion (at least, until Vega's laughable breakdown when he sees the plaque memorializing the deceased colonists -- that seemed WAY over the top for me), and it does fill in the blanks on the newest member of the Normandy crew, but I wouldn't consider it a must-have.

With that in mind, I think it's completely appropriate to compare the narrative and presentation of this Anime-style film to the experience of playing the games.  Of course, it's primarily an action-based Anime targeted towards males, so I'd say, if you are someone who plays Mass Effect as the default Male Shepard, chooses the Soldier class, and turns off the dialogue choices, ""Paragon Lost"" might not be a bad investment of 1:30 of your time.  It's a perfectly serviceable time-killer and, if compared to the quality of other tie-in products, is competently-made.

If you're anyone else, though, please read on.

""Paragon Lost"" expounds upon the character and backstory of James Vega, who joins your squad in Mass Effect 3, and one specific, life-defining mission that he references in that game - the one where he ""got everyone killed and got promoted for it.""  Vega starts off the film by saving an Alliance colony from the Blood Pack, the mercenary group mentioned in the games that consists of fearsome Krogan and Vorcha.  This first act is to establish his connection to Shepard, who inspires him to become the defacto leader of his squad when the circumstance calls for it.  You also get a sense of the powers and skills of his all-human squad: an engineer, a biotic, a sniper, and two Soldier/Vanguard types.  Vega himself is a Soldier type with no biotic powers, though it's established that he has the coolest head, the most leadership skills, and is the most physically strong member of his squad.  There is also an Asari love interest for Vega who doesn't fight and has no powers; she's purely an archeologist, in fact a protege of one Liara T'Soni, one of the most prominent characters in the Mass Effect games.  The squad eventually finds themselves in a dire, desperate situation involving a Collector attack on a settlement called Fehl Prime, with pretty unfortunate consequences the result.

The film showcases many of the broad qualities of the Mass Effect universe: some of the more prominent alien races, the powers and class types, and the dynamic of humans being relatively new to the galactic community, yet rising in status and power quickly.  It also makes you understand Vega and his psychology much more than the game he appeared in, where most players viewed him as a stereotypical, beefcake afterthought of a character.

Here's a hypothetical situation.  Say you have a friend who wants to understand your obsession with Mass Effect and why you hug your Liara pillow to sleep every night.  Say your friend doesn't want to devote 90+ hours to play the games and instead wants to spend two or so hours being introduced to what makes Mass Effect so great.  On one level, ""Paragon Lost"" is a competent enough production that you'd think it'd be the perfect gateway for an ME neophyte (I'm comparing this film to similar films of its ilk, NOT Studio Ghibli films or anything of that caliber).  The problem, however, is not in the execution.

The problem is in the story itself.

""Paragon Lost"" is extremely formulaic and simplistic in terms of plot and narrative.  Characters might as well be named after the specific trope they represent: Nerdy Engineer Guy, Headstrong Gunner Girl, Weak-Willed Love Interest, etc.  In fact, I can't recall most of their names as I'm writing this review.  It presents Mass Effect as far more conventional and macho than the games themselves actually are.  For an accessible entry point into the Mass Effect universe, it makes for a great action movie from 1993, if you catch my drift.

Vega's sole motivation for improving himself is to be like the off-screen Commander Shepard.  When something tragic happens to him at the end of the film and he reflects on it, he moves from moribund grief to steely resolve in literally the last two minutes before the credits roll.  His Asari love interest has absolutely zero personality and is only there to reject his advances while secretly appreciating his mammalian desire, except when she's serving her only role plot-wise by BEING CAPTURED.  Vega's squad is completely human, unlike Shepard's ragtag team of aliens and robots, and most of them display varying levels of contempt towards the various alien races in the universe.

By the way, of those alien races, we meet the Krogan and Vorcha, who are either mindless killing machines or opportunists, the Collectors, who are mindless Big Bads, and the Asari love interest, who is useless eye candy and a blue damsel in distress.

The appeal of the Mass Effect games for most fans lies within the complex and dynamic relationships between people and different races.  That is vital to the Mass Effect experience.  Without it, it'd be Halo...which is kind of like what ""Paragon Lost"" is.  You come away from this film knowing nothing about the Mass Effect universe other than all the alien races are either violent killers or useless sexpots.  Three-dimensional characters from the game like Wrex, Grunt, Liara, Samara, and Aria would be ashamed of how their respective races are depicted in this film.

Lastly, ""Paragon Lost"" commits one unforgivable sin lore-wise.  At one point, a character refers to Shepard as someone who ""kicks ass and always rescues the girl,"" or something to that effect, calling upon the tried-and-true (and tired) stereotype of an action hero who rescues (and therefore romances) the princess at the end.  Bear in mind, that means that ""Paragon Lost"" is implicitly suggesting that Shepard, whose gender and sexuality you get to choose yourself in the game, is either a straight male or a lesbian female, committing the number one cardinal sin of any Mass Effect tie-in: obscure Shepard's identity because there are as many versions of the character as there are players of the games themselves.

I'll reword something I stated earlier: As a Mass Effect tie-in, ""Paragon Lost"" is a great Halo tie-in.",1378857600,3,6072,4.916666666666667

Naturally, I was really interested in the only movie for the series, so I did have high hopes for ""Paragon Lost"". Anyway, it's not that bad but it's definitely not that great either. I rented it, thankfully, for 4$ here on Amazon but I couldn't imagine paying 16$ or however much it costs to own it simply because it really wasn't that quality of a movie (decent animation but very predictable storyline/plot).

The director is Japanese and this film is heavily anime, complete with scenes that are supposed to be brooding, deep, and emotional but fall flat since you don't really care for any of the characters. While the Mass Effect series has some of the best soundtracks in the industry, this film sticks with weird Japanese pop and out of place orchestral scores that could have been made buy a guy with a key board and 5 minutes.

I wasn't hoping for much in this film. A small amount of original content or the fleshing out of the universe would have been nice. There is nothing good here.",1370908800,,767,4.394366197183099

Animation and graphics are nowhere near on par with the games, but the voice acting for the main characters are great to good-enough. They also stay true to the Mass Effect sound effects and jargon, while fitting in very well between the stories of ME 1 and 2. However, what made it most disappointing for me was how corny they made a lot of scenes and dialogue throughout the movie, especially the very end.

Therefore, I would only recommend buying this DVD/Blu-ray if you are a Mass Effect fan (and you know if you are or not). Otherwise, get it another way or move on.",1367798400,,738,4.45925925925926

5165739,2,B008HUSF70,"I'm a long time mass effect franchise fan, so I was eager to get my hands on this product, especially after having seen some of the previews and teasers leading up to it. However, I cannot in good faith recommend this movie to anyone.

The animation style changes around a few times, and not for the better or for story or stylistic reasons, leading one to conclude the main animating studio either ran out of budget before completion, or just plain gave up or farmed it out to a low-wage shop.

The voice acting and dialogue is somewhat substandard, leaving one with the impression that the actors were phoning it in for a paycheck.

There are a few scenes that are jarring, either because it violates the canon for the Mass Effect setting, or because it seems to ignore common sense; a spoiler free example of the latter being when some of the marines in an elite special forces team literally don't know the meaning of the word or the concept of 'flanking'.

Honestly, this product seemingly turned into a blatant cash grab by Bioware/EA. It may have started out with good intentions, but it never made it far.

While it's not total drek, it's not worth your $10 (the price I paid for the DVD version). If you're still interested in seeing it, wait for it to either hit the $2 bargain bins, or better yet, when it will eventually be 'free' content on one of the streaming services out there.",1366156800,3,1394,4.515873015873016

This is a stand alone movie, that can be watched without having any prior knowledge to the amazing ME trilogy, and is about one of the newest characters that we didn't have a chance to get to know because of the war with the Reapers, this is the story of James Vega, a Marine that respects his heroes, and learns what it takes to be one. The movie has great voice acting, and even though they didn't get the original voice actors for Admiral Hackett and Admiral Anderson, the actors that did play them did a great job in portraying them despite fan boy complaints. Now for the so-called inconsistencies that are in the anime, such as the shot gun that shoots like an automatic, again, who cares? the point is the Anime, and the storyline behind the characters and the decisions that have to be made, the anime was beautifully done, and it's a great one to have in your collection, I would highly recommended, despite the fan-boy outrage, there is just no pleasing them, as for me, I thought it was wonderful, and I'm very happy with my purchase.",1365984000,,1232,4.45575221238938

I've never been a big fan of James Vega, but this movie really gives his character a new light. If you like Mass Effect this won't disappoint you :)",1365120000,,505,4.419354838709677
5165754,2,B008HUSF70,"The only reason I have given this a 2 out of 5 star is that I liked the animation, otherwise this movie is a 1 star.

The thing I loved about the Mass Effect games was that the society itself was very egalitarian. Males and females were equals (at least in the human race). This movie though, each woman seems to be an object to be played with honestly. For instance, within the first 10 minutes of the movie you see a woman get her butt grabbed and then the men joke about how they are girly. This is made even more puzzlung when you realize this female is the commanding officer of the unit. It's just strange to see in Mass Effect if not off putting.

Another huge flaw was the story itself! Vega saves the day and gets information on the
Collectors? Where is his medal? Where was this info for Mass Effect 3?",1365033600,2,812,4.198717948717949

The first time I played ME3, I only got bits and pieces of what James went through. The anime answered all the questions I was left asking. I don't know which came first, the idea for the movie, or Vega's vague past, but it definitely works if you've played the game.
Don't expect any super-amazing graphics, it's an anime. I wish the dialog was a little better, but it's just about the same style of speaking as in the game. Lots of forced statements and one-liners, but it gets the job done. Overall, an joy to watch, especially for this fan girl. Highly recommend if you're playing through the series.",1364947200,,741,4.416058394160584

5165758,4,B008HUSF70,"""Mass Effect"", the popular and succesful sci-fi RPG/third person shooter from Canadian company BioWare (""Baldur's Gate"", ""Neverwinter Nights"", ""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"", ""Dragon Age"") released in 2007 would become one of the most succesful franchises in video game history and known for featuring wonderful graphics and storytelling.

The game which would feature the adventures of Commander Shepherd who works hard to stop the rogue Spectre Saren Arterius from leading his army of geth to conquer the galaxy.

In  2010, BioWare released the sequel ""Mass Effect 2, Commander Shepard is forced into an uneasy alliance with the Pro-Human paramilitary organization known as Cerberus in order to discover why human colonies were attacked and how everyone disappeared without a trace.

And in March 2012, the third and final installment titled ""Mass Effect 3 revolves around the Reapers returning and trying to purge the galaxy and attacking Earth.  And this time Commander Shepard must race against time to rally the advanced races of the galaxy to make one final stand to fight the Reapers and also to save Earth.

With novels and comic-book series taking place in the Mass Effect universe having been released since 2007, an animated film was announced to be released in 2012 produced by T.O. Entertainment and would be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation.  The storyline of the film, known as ""Mass Effect: Paragon Lost"" would be a prequel to ""Mass Effect 3 and follow the earlier career of Alliance Marine James Vega who leads an elite Special Forces into battle against an alien race known as The Collectors.

With ""Mass Effect: Paragon Lost"", the story revolves takes place in the human colony of Fehl Prime, a colony known for producing pharmaceuticals for the Systems Alliance.

But the colony is attacked by the Blood Pack mercenaries led by krogan Archuk.  So, the alliance sends out the marines to aid the colonists and during landing, unfortunately, the majority of the alliance sent to Fehl Prime are shot and killed, but one manages to land and its the marine unit, Delta Squad (featuring Kamille, Nicky, Milque, Essex and Mason) led by Lt. James Vega.

The Delta Squad manages to defeat the Blood Pack and Admiral Steven Hackett orders the squad to stay in Fehl Prime to protect the colonists from future attacks.

Two years later and Fehl Prime has a better defense with anti-ship cannons, kinetic barriers and Delta Squad has made an impact in improving the defenses of the Fehl Prime.  But one day, the group receives a jamming signal and Lt. Vega along with asari anthropologist Treeya, the colonist Messner go to investigate and find out that an unknown alien device is jamming signals.

As Treeya wants to protect it from harm, Essex destroys it.  But as the group heads back to the colony, they find out that a Collector ship has flown overhead of the colony and deploys its Seeker Swarms to attack the colony and for some reason are capturing colonists.  But will Lt. Vega and team be able to defeat the Collectors?

VIDEO:

""Mass Effect: Paragon Lost"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  Production I.G. is my favorite animation studio from Japan.  When it comes to character designs and art backgrounds, they are known for detail.  But with Electronic Arts/BioWare involved with the CD animated film for ""Dragon Age"", it was great to see that they went for an anime release.  Picture quality of the film is absolutely vibrant.  Excellent shading, art backgrounds were nicely detailed with black levels inky and deep and for the most part, the film not showing any signs of artifacts or aliasing.  Nor did I see any banding during my viewing of the film.

With that being said, I did feel the animation and character design were suited for a western audience.  I've seen Production I.G. go all out before in anime such as ""Eden of the East"" and ""Ghost Hound"" and while animation and art backgrounds from the studio tend to be magnificent, ""Mass Effect: Paragon Lost"" looked great, but just not magnificent.

AUDIO:

""Mass Effect: Paragon Lost"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  An as one can expect from an action-driven film, the film utilizes the surround channels and LFE effectively.  Great dynamic range and immersiveness when it comes to explosions, fights against monstrous enemies to the zipping of energy blasts.  Lossless audio is very good.  Voice acting is well-done and it's interesting to see Freddie Prinze, Jr. doing the voice of James Vega.  Unfortunately, there are some characters that with overacting! But for the most part, the English dub is very good.

Unfortunately, for those wanting a Japanese voice acting soundtrack, there isn't one.

JUDGMENT CALL:

At first, I was a bit hesitant if I would be able to understand what is going on with ""Mass Effect: Lost Paragon"".

As a gamer who owns the games (and have yet to beat any of them), I'm not exactly an erudite on the whole ""Mass Effect"" story.  So, I worried that I may be lost when it comes to the ""Mass Effect"" storyline.

Fortunately, the writers kept the story simple.  A group of colonists are being attacked and the marines from the Delta Force Squad must protect the colonists from any harm but also help them protect their colony with defensive weaponry.

But there are enough complexities to make the storyline incorporate clever plot twists, action but also emotion, as one leader must make the decision of sacrificing soldiers and colonists for the better future of tomorrow or to sacrifice data and information that would serve the better good of the people in the future to save soldiers, the people right at that moment.  A crucial decision that has to be made, which one would you pick?  And similar to the game, which is about making choices, Vega had to make a decision that no matter which one he picked, lives would be lost.

If anything, the animated film gives new insight to the the disappearance of the colonists of the third game but also gives us details of the character, James Vega.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio were fantastic.  Some may not be used to seeing the characters in anime format and there may be some who prefer seeing the CG style that was utilized for ""Dragon Age"".  But it's all subjective and for me, the fact that Production I.G. was involved tells me that Electronic Arts wanted the best and they got one of the best (in my opinion, is the best) anime studio for the project.  Voice acting for this anime series was well-cast and Freddie Prinze, Jr. did a wonderful job portraying Vega.

Most of the time, anime that was inspired and based on a major video game franchise, typically does not translate well as an animated film or OVA.  If anything, most often, these films or OVA's based off video games tend to suck.  But with the collaboration between the major video game companies in America, utilizing American writing but Japanese animation work and style, these collaborations have been good so far.  I enjoyed ""Dragon Age"" and I enjoyed ""Mass Effect: Paragon Lost"".

At first, I thought the film would be another ""Starship Troopers"" type of storyline and while there is a lot of chaos and a large body count, along with the action, you have a smart and effective storyline.  It' s not all popcorn action, the decision that Vega must make was very difficult and you can easily sympathize with the character, especially to when Vega must confront the true reality of the decision he made.  It's quite heartbreaking!  But you understand why he did it.

An action-packed sci-fi film that captures the soul of the ""Mass Effect"" video games and the difficult choices that must be made for the many, not the one.  And for the character of James Vega, we get to see how one man's decision will have an major effect on the alliance, and a decision that will affect this character.

""Mass Effect: Paragon Lost"" was an enjoyable, action-packed sci-fi film that fans and even those not familiar with the ""Mass Effect"" video games can enjoy.  Recommended!",1364601600,,8973,4.912956810631229

5165765,3,B008HUSF70,"Paragon Lost is strong in animation and weak in plot.  It is closer to American science fiction than it is to Japanese Anime science fiction.  Xenosaga, which was also based on a computer game, was the opposite.

The plot has comic book simplicity: aliens are pestering humans.  Lacking are the convoluted plot, deranged characters and intense emotions characteristic of Anime science fiction.  Paragon Lost tried to have a Japanese River of Tears ending, but it didn't succeed.  Probably, the reason that it didn't succeed was that the lead character was male.  That type of ending is something that Anime heroines do very well.

The animation is excellent.  The colors are sharp and the characters move realistically.  The humans combat gear and the bodies of the aliens are well detailed.  The aliens don't appear to be biologically plausible, but thats not important.  The important thing is that they appear threatening.  Blue Drop was unusual because its aliens were good looking women wearing silver leotards.

Is Paragon Lost oriented toward adults or early teens?  Its plot would be suitable for a comic book.  Its issues are simple.  There aren't any nifty heroines to keep the guys interested.  My feeling is that its all right for an adult as long as you don't expect to get more out of it than light entertainment.

I think that Paragon Lost could be of interest to someone who likes animated American science fiction, but might not interest an Anime science fiction fan.  As American science fiction, its average, not great.  I don't regret buying Paragon Lost, but I'm not certain that I would want to buy a continuation of it.",1363478400,,1642,4.91970802919708

I found the overall quality of the anime to be very poor; substandard - from character design and plot, to the scripting and the voice-over acting. It felt more like watching a bad Saturday morning cartoon animated by high school students, than a top-notch production the Japanese and BioWare are notorious for producing.

A friend commented that Commander Shepard's character would not have even allowed James on his team had this been the truth of the haunting back story, and I tend to agree. Assume for the moment that the apparent mass Alzheimer's effect experienced by various key characters, the barely modified Ashley-Collector story, wrongly executed Mass Effect Universe technology and the immature dialog were excusable. James' ""hard choice"" made him a complete cretin, destroying the likability of the in-game character. Further, the sacrifice he made is to no avail. During Mass Effect 2  Hackett and Anderson never made strategic use of the results of the mission in this movie.

<SPOILER> Hackett and Anderson (according to Paragon Lost) would have already known about the final boss of Mass Effect 2. Yet in-game they are as mystified as everyone else. Obviously no-one in Funimation actually played the game.<END SPOILER>

In all, it is worth a watch. I would personally wait to buy this at a price below $15. Being I purchased it at launch, I knew I would be paying a premium, but overall I am not disappointing. I will watch it again.

The story is fine, but no where near the scope and importance of the games. It is like a brief aside to the galactic epic which the games put forth.

My biggest disappointment was with the art style. I've seen 20 year old anime with better character art. While there were inserts of CGI elements (mostly ships and technology), the actual characters were very poorly drawn. I was hoping for something along the lines of Ghost in the Shell or even the CGI Final Fantasy films and Appleseed (from 2004).

5165813,1,B008HUSF70,"The short:

Animation is terrible
CGI - bad at best
Story - meh at best
Audio - least the explosions sound good

The Long:

This movie feels rushed!  Facial animations are horribly drawn (one female character has severe eye droop.  When they try and pan the scene eyes will start moving all over the place.

character models are also poorly drawn/and anatomically disproportionate, lots of tropes (guy with glasses = nerd, tree trunk = jock) I am pretty sure I don't remember anyone in ME wearing glasses (i could be wrong).  Funny note when the asari doctor character is talking to Liara the doctor looks like Liara and Liara looks all deformed. well least the vorcha and collectors look nice.

CGI - looks like mid to late 90's graphics.  Dull, flat, and blurry.

Audio - Be happy with explosions because they drown out the rest of the mess that should be audio.  (remember in the game when the characters talk with their helmets on it distorts their voice?  The audio team producing this movie didn't. They try to deliver moving dialogue but either the voice actors weren't appraised of the emotion they were supposed to be conveying or they just didn't care either way lines that are supposed to make you feel for their situation just come across as phoned in.

Story - .. Dialogue is horrible at best, hell you don't even make it 3 minutes in before they have their first sexual harassment character development moment.  It's even funnier because the artists spent more time drawing the female characters rear than they did her face.  Another funny sloppy animation to story moment is when the Lt is reporting into Admiral Hacket and the Lt's (guy with the tree trunk neck) mouth is wide open but his dialogue is being delivered at almost casual tone).

The only thing I can recommend is that you stay far away from this movie.",1357430400,6,1832,4.660436137071651

Being made by Funimation, Inc., you will definitely hear some familiar voices (Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey, Vic Mignogna), making Paragon Lost fairly standard anime fare.

5165817,4,B008HUSF70,"Overall the movie provides a view into the Mass Effect universe outside of Shepard In a way new to the franchise.  I was overall entertained and found it enjoyable (in spite of myself not being a big fan of Anime), but there were a few things that weren't accurate in game lore, and some things that were just kinda silly.

The lore:  As I'm sure others have mentioned there is a scene in which it shows Sovereign being pulled by ships via tow cables at the Citadel.  At the end of Mass Effect 1, it was totally destroyed(Sovereign), parts blown everywhere.

The Citadel shown being in orbit around a planet is incorrect, the Citadel is in a nebula.

Non-lore related issues I have with the action scenes comprised of things like SMGs being able to blast down ceilings to block paths and a Krogan being able to be brought down by a single pistol/smg shot from behind.

As for the story, It was what I was expecting from my knowledge of the lore of the game, so no real surprises, however, the ending was well done and the consequences of choice were illustrated in a dramatic way. I have never been a real Vega-hater to begin with but, this film makes me appreciate the character more (along with Vega's Homeworld comic).

There are other really minor nickpicky things that came to mind while watching, which did detract from my viewing, but nothing that should really be held against the film.",1357257600,,1394,4.548

5165820,5,B008HUSF70,"To be very concise, any serious fan of Mass Effect will deeply enjoy this anime.  It is mostly true to the lore of Mass Effect, while also presenting additional depth and development to the character of James Vega, who was considered to me as the LEAST interesting character in the Mass Effect Universe.  That being said, this anime expands on the back story of James Vega, while also presenting a wealth of references, action, and the high standard of detail that resides within the entire Mass Effect franchise.

I can honestly say that after watching the anime, it inspired me to play the games from start to finish, all over again.  This is coming from someone who has, frankly, exhausted the series of games, in their entirety. I have replayed Mass Effect 2 and 3, so many times, that I have lost count.  Additionally, I have replayed Mass Effect 1 which, is so dated (at this current day) that only the hardcore fans would be willing to relive multiple times. The story within the games is so deep and compelling, that it rivals the all-time greats of Star Wars and any other widely appreciated space opera.  This is a very bold statement, but those who truly know Mass Effect, through and through, would probably agree with me.  It's THAT good.

Is the anime above and beyond what one would generally expect? Absolutely not.  However, it is polished enough to justify you owning it in your library of anime or cinema.  Obviously, this is the opinion of one man.  But, if you are an advocate of the Mass Effect franchise in ANY way, you are doing yourself an injustice by not owning or watching this anime.

This fact needs to be cited.  I was very concerned about this anime once I realized it was not about Shepard.  It is, in fact, about a character that I considered to be the weakest amongst all of the others in the Mass Effect universe.  However, this did not detract from the overall experience.  True fans of Mass Effect will be satiated with a wealth of contributions to the lore of the ME universe, and quasi fans will have varying opinions.

Real quickly, I have read various complaints concerning the animation quality.  I own, and have watched, hundreds of anime titles.  This ranks among the best. Don't be concerned with the complaints of the highly critical.  The animation is close to top-notch, in terms of animation qualtity (smoothness, detail,non freeze-frame, etc.) Obviously, this is my opinion, but just watch the previews, if you are that concerned.  If you are hyper critical about the animation in comparison to the quality of the story and lore, so much so that it turns you off, don't even bother.

In summation, if you consider yourself a true fan of Mass Effect, you WILL enjoy this anime.  Will you scrutinize it? Yes, most likely.  But, that's not to say that you won't thoroughly enjoy and appreciate it.  I seriously hope this aids those who are 'on the fence' about owning this title.

Anime Quality - 8/10
Story - 8/10
Lore Quality/Justice to the games - 8/10
Voice Acting - 9/10
Soundtrack - 6/10 (little to no bearing on overall quality)",1357171200,,3083,4.662962962962963
5165821,3,B008HUSF70,"I was really excited to see a feature length cartoon spinoff, perhaps giving more insight into the Mass Effect universe. But really, after watching it, I don't have much to say.

Take one part anime, one part Saturday morning Advanced Dungeons and Dragons cartoon, add a very large dose of Mass Effect rehash, and you've got the recipe for something that is pretty underwhelming. The dialog, the plot, everything was pretty much cliche. We don't really learn anything substantially new about the Mass Effect universe, except that the Collectors and the Krogan were apparently 15 feet tall, and everyone wants to engage in glib one-liners which, at their very best, register as mildy interesting.

One again, they repeated their mistake from the original end of Mass Effect 3. Bad writing, bad writing, bad writing. These characters are so one-dimensional. Even the most fleshed out character, Vega, is pretty flat. He loves Commander Shepard. He loves being a marine. And right on cue, he starts bursting out in Spanish like a Dora the Explorer in space. Was Vega fleshed out in his feature film? Hardly. Sadly, if this movie was your introduction to the Mass Effect universe, you'd wonder what anyone could find so interesting.

Extremely minor spoiler: in the end, Vega was faced with a terrible choice which, once made, he agonized over. They gave a heavy-handed nod to the overall Mass Effect theme of decisions and consequences. Very heavy handed. Like they were overcompensating with emotional weight in order to cover up for an otherwise underwhelming story.

Do yourself a favor. Unless you're a megafan, you'll probably want to sit this one out until it is at the $5 mark or is available for Amazon Instant Video. A few sentences can describe the entire movie, and after that, you're missing out on precious little.
