3611188,5,B001GIJRPE,"I do this routine every morning.  I really like the walking through each set of 12 reps (2 sets each).  I know I could be more hard core and do more but it keeps it doable and short.  I started with 5 pounds each and now up to 15/20 pounds.  It does make a difference.  I wish they would have counted the reps better since it is hard sometimes to know which number we are on and get ahead of the instructors (I tend to go faster than they do).  They should also have rested better in between so you can follow it (REAL TIME) and not rely on the PAUSE button which I never do.

The added routines are just clips of the first routine rearranged which was kind of a bummer.  But, this really does work and hits all the major groups.  The warm up and cool down stretches are absolutely essential and a nice addition.  Some days I have to really work at it but others, it works great.

So it is easy to stick with.

They should make more routines on another video and release a 2nd edition with a ""random"" feature so you can be suprised.  Otherwise, it is a great (keep you to task) weight video that works as intended.  I really miss the days when I don't get to do the routine.  It makes a huge difference.

All in all, I love that this keeps me on track.  THANKS!",1326672000,2,1261,4.060975609756097

3611190,4,B001GIJRPE,"I've used this DVD for over 6 months and love it.
That said, I don't use the warm-up. (I do one half hour of yoga instead.) I use the 2nd level WITHOUT MUSIC. I am disappointed in the sloppy editing for this sequence. It needs to be redone. Plus there is no explanation of the 2nd or 3rd level, why you would want to use them, or how.
I like the pace and the options. And just enough instructions during the sets.",1297382400,2,413,4.048780487804878
3611191,5,B001GIJRPE,"I have a small space to workout and love this video because it doesn't require a great deal of space. I can also use it in my RV when I travel.

3611192,3,B001GIJRPE,"It was a very well-instructed dvd.  As stated, it is definitely for beginners.  My only disappointment with it was that it was all the same exercises presented in 3 different ways-meaning a superset, a push-pull set, etc.  According to the time on it, it was a long dvd but since they were all the same exercises a little disappointing if you were expecting more.",1278288000,6,363,4.640625
3611193,1,B001GIJRPE,"I have to start with a disclaimer: I gave up on this program about 2 minutes into the Warm Up.
Why?  Because like all other fitness program, this one SWITCHES MOVES on the poor beginner every 4 or 5 SECONDS!  I can't keep up, and it makes me feel so stupid I want to cry. First you walk in place for about 4 steps, then when you're not even sure you're getting that right (how high do I lift the feet?), start popping over to one side!  Huh?  Oh, never mind, now I want you to go front-front-back-back and at the same time please do this complicated maneuver with your arms! Got that?  No, you're still at the side lunge thing? Well, too late, that's over already and I now want you to do another move more complicated than the cha-cha-cha for 3 seconds.

I did go through the introduction and the explanation of the movements.  Those were good, so you get 1 star.  And besides, I don't know how to give you zero stars.

Here's a hint for the creators of this video: find someone who really is an absolute beginner and beta-test your program.  If they turn off the power 30 seconds into the warm up, maybe your program needs some revisions.

Only someone who's been doing warm-ups like the one in here all their lives can follow the complicated, bait-and-switch exercise in frustration in this video.  NOT BEGINNERS.

What I need: a warm-up where the routine changes no more frequently than every 30 seconds.  Hey, it takes me 10 just to figure out what YOU're doing, 10 more to make sure I'm doing it right! Let me just enjoy it for 10 more seconds, ok?
Example: Walk in place for 30 seconds, side-steps for 30 seconds, etc.

Too bad.  Friendly instructors, good quality taping.  Would have preferred a little bouncy Bach in the background, but I don't suppose there's any chance of ever finding that...

I weicome responses especially if a reader knows of a program like the one I'm dreaming of, or the makers of this one come up with a corrected version.
Thanks!",1273017600,68,1965,4.441340782122905
3611194,4,B001GIJRPE,"Beginning my strength training program I was looking for something basic, for beginners. A workout that was not too easy, well taught and effective. Although this is not the greatest produced video, it does the job. I felt muscle I hadn't felt after doing other workout - don't know how I made it this far without those muscles... They give a great introduction on how to use this video, a tutorial on how to execute the movements and motivation to keep you going. This video has three methods on it - beginner, intermediate and advanced to keep you going a whole year + long. Great!

I give it four stars because of the productions lack of - well, production quality. The instructors are a bit messy when it comes to those resting/stretch periods, as if they had no plan of execution before the camera(s) ran. They are out of sync and have no clear cut movement for you to utilize. So... pick one or two and go from there.

Also, they chose to use the cut and paste method on methods two and three - simply  put, they cut exercises from method 1 and pasted them in several spots throughout the latter two methods, giving you the same comments over and over, instead of filming these exercises again with fresh motivation. These instructors look competent enough to go throught the movements again, safely.  Great exercise routine, cheap production.

The above problems aside, these are effective routines. Especially for beginners who need to build up that muscle. You will feel the burn, but a good one. If it hurts use lighter weights, rest and repeat.

Good Luck.",1266278400,50,1567,4.659420289855072

3611211,3,B001GIJRPE,OK but not nearly as good as other videos on exercise. Method is OK but dull.  Other videos are much better at providing a routine that includes exercise and rest.

That does not mean it is lightweight.  You can progress through the carefully constructed range of movements, end up more toned, more strong, and lose some weight by following the exercises and levels, than you even thought possible.  The CD features a man and woman explaining and demonstrating proper form of each exercise and one of them will do the lifts along with you, while the other coaches or counts.  Both legs and arms are covered, with abs at the end.  The 2 person team has decent rapport, no phony irritating musak, and a basic setting.
