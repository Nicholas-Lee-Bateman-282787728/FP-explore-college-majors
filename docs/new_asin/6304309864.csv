. I like how this movie used a villain from earlier books.  Most of the time (like Muppet Babies), the adults are in silhouettes or feet only.  Here you get to see their design of a classic Ozian character.

. The story is multidimensional as the characters split up to conquer Mombi's evil scheme.  Also, unlike the rest in the collection, the story isn't a reworking of a book from Baum's collection.

. Very good ",1416873600,,492,4.46067415730337
