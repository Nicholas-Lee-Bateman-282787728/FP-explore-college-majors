It took forever to receive my package but after it was received by the birthday girl, her mom told me she loved it and would stand in front of the tv for an hour and dance like the little girls on the DVD. So, it was a success.",1214352000,9,302,3.7936507936507935

Thanks for the lift, kuleana productions.",1423958400,2,273,4.169811320754717

8036855,5,B000624D00,"got this video for the grandgirls before we all went to hawaii, they watched it on the plane on the way there and actually remembered alot of the moves, which helped when they got to go on stage at the luau!  their ages are 2-5.",1356912000,,228,4.066666666666666
8036856,5,B000624D00,"I've recently stated taking Hawaiian hula lessons and just love it, so I went on the lookout for any information I could find on this awesome dance and found this video. It's a lot of fun to watch and dance with. While it is no way replaces actual live in person classes, it is a good start.  I highly recommend the extra features. Very informative and entertaining. So if you want to get a start with hula, I'd say get this video.",1324425600,4,431,4.2560975609756095
8036857,3,B000624D00,"I bought this to use for a library program for kids.  It is an instructional dvd and shows step by step moves to the hula.  There are two main movements taught in the beginning.  The dances are a little complex when adding the arm movements but the dancing is beautiful and fun.  Little girls especially would love to move back and forth to the music, telling the stories with their arms.  It is a little awkward when she says to move to the right and we are watching her move to our left (I found that impossible).  I just moved along with her and ignored the right/left instructions.  There are some parts you'll want to play back over and over- like the 1st walkthrough of hand motions, since it's only shown once before performing it.  And there are some parts where no instruction is happening that you will want to fast forward through.  Overall it's fun and very colorful and cheerful.",1307577600,6,892,4.490683229813665

The video was perfect for the party because it only has few songs and they put attention almost all teh time.",1300665600,4,243,4.083333333333333
