4098042,4,B0039UU3G4,"This is a good who-dun-it mystery.  We really liked this movie.  The plot was good, even with it's twists and turns.  We were definitely surprised at the end to find out who was really behind the whole thing.  We enjoyed the characters in the movie and also enjoyed the setting.  We would definitely recommend this movie to people who like mysteries.",1384992000,4,350,4.672131147540983
4098043,5,B0039UU3G4,"I love Andy Griffith!  This movie is still somewhat ""odd"" for me to watch because his life is no longer a Mayberry delight.  He was a great actor & I believe under~rated & his movies proof this!",1376179200,,194,4.216216216216216
4098044,1,B0039UU3G4,"This creeped me out. I was scared through the whole movie. If that is what you like, well this might be for you. But I don't like it and It's already gone from my library.",1359072000,,171,3.914285714285714
4098045,1,B0039UU3G4,"I ordered Winter Kill & Deadly Game since I like Andy Griffith.

Winter Kill is an excellent suspense movie.

Deadly Game is not.  Very boring & slow.  I would have returned it if I was able to.  Very sorry I wasted my money!!!!",1331251200,2,228,4.209302325581396
4098046,3,B0039UU3G4,"OK Made for TV type movie. Good addition to that Andy Griffith collection. Nice to see Ange in civillian clothes. The Andy Griffith movie that I recently bought, that I liked, was Savages. Where Andy plays an evil guy hunting human prey in the wilderness. Cool thing about Andy Griffith, was that he could break away from his Nice-guy typecast, and really surprise you with how cold-blooded he could be.",1318118400,4,403,4.771428571428571

4098095,4,B0039UU3G4,"In his younger years Andy Griffith was an excellent actor - not the way John Wayne or some of the other big stars were, but he was pretty good at what he did and I liked what he did.  This is a good story line and he does a good job with it.",1424649600,,241,3.547169811320755

8392350,5,B0039UU3G4,"Andy Griffith stars as the sheriff when he discovers that something strange is going on in his town.  This series of three movies will leave you begging for more, but these were the only three he made.  If you like the JESSIE STONE series, these are along the same line and will keep you focused from the beginning to the end of the story.  They are not shown on television anymore, but the one time they did show them I watched all three.  It took me awhile to find them on line, but thankfully I did.",1437523200,3,502,4.197916666666667
