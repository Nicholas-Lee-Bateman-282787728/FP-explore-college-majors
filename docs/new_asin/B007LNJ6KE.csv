8519405,1,B007LNJ6KE,"STAR ODYSSEY is another ludicrous Italian sci-fi yarn from the 70s. Absurd, inane, and, worst of all, heinously dull, ODYSSEY is supposed to be ""the Italian STAR WARS"", but don't let that get your hopes up! Features supremely annoying heroes (especially the man called Lt. Oliver ""Hollywood"" Cerrara), an outrageously pompous, giant-collared villain (picture Darth Vader w/ no mask, big hair, and a face that's been burned in a waffle-iron), his blond-wigged man-droids, a clunky robot, groovy furniture, and ""special"" effects that add new dimensions to the word ""scant"". Filled w/ non-choreographed fight scenes, bland romance, and enough schlock-y, moldy cheeeze to start a global pizza franchise, this movie will have you rolling on the floor. Not w/ laughter, but w/ moaning nausea. The nonsensical boxing match, and junkyard-robot-resurrection sequences are particular ""highlights"". Part of the fun, aside from trying to remain awake, comes from futile attempts to make sense of it all. Random stock footage, like the bombing of Dresden, adds just the right amount of mystery to the proceedings. If you make it to the end credits, you'll either feel in need of a vacation, a cyanide capsule, or both...",1428105600,,1207,5.291666666666667
8519406,2,B007LNJ6KE,"Ive got one word to sum up this less than spectacular sci-fi spectacle: S  L  O  W.  It takes its time to go really not very far at all, like a snail trying to lap a slug.  What I remember most about this is that there is a ragtag misfit group of characters gathered together to save something from someone who uses robot men with bleached blonde wigs (I think these robots were featured in another movie, maybe The War of the Robots?).  Theres a super smart dude whos telepathic, and bald (an early Prof. X!?!), some acrobatic fighting guy whos always bounding about and bouncing off walls (ADHD works for him), some sharp shooter and a woman dressed oddly and showing a lot of leg who helps some other smart dude whos got hair, and two robots whose only wish is to die because their love for each other hurts very much and they have the ability to become transparent.you know, now that I think about it this team may just have had some influence on the creation of Marvels X-Men.but I digress.  Even if these characters sound interesting to you in the slightest its best to avoid this turkey.  Its tedious, at best.",1424304000,,1117,4.414634146341464
8519407,1,B007LNJ6KE,"This is another MST grade Italian science fiction. Without any build up, alien invaders come to earth to gather slaves. They are able to get through our ""atomic cannons"" and ""hyper-radar.""  The film then uses some flashbacks and only the hypnotic Professor Mauri  can discover ""anti-indirium"" to defeat the aliens...along with two robots and a bimbo.  Worse light sabers every used in a film.

Laughably bad.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1414108800,2,437,5.098591549295775
8519408,2,B007LNJ6KE,"We have here a privately-manufactured DVD. My experience with barebones DVD-Rs has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

The best thing about STAR ODYSSEY (1979) is its name in Italian:
""Sette uomini d'oro nello spazio.""

Spazz is right!

Aliens in platinum blonde Prince Valiant wigs and silvery bargain basement Halloween space suits invade the Earth to enslave us all.

The population of Earth in this futuristic disaster includes lots of folks in cardboard and tinfoil ""robot"" outfits. One female-voiced machine is a 55-gallon drum with nubbin-sized arms that sits on a wheeled platform. Another child-sized robotic ""couple"" have a lover's spat while a human inexplicably stands on his head!

A no-name cast (who'd wanna be in this piece of whizz?) go through some ludicrous motions as the audience blissfully dozes.",1341964800,,1009,5.24223602484472
