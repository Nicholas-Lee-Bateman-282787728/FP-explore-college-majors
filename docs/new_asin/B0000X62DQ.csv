8167504,3,B0000X62DQ,"No Mercy 2003 Took Place in Baltimore MD on Oct 19, 2003. good Match between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker in a ""biker chain"" Match. Good Match, this was their rematch from the Hell in a Cell in 2002. The Worst Match of the night was Vince vs Steph in a daughter i quit match. Also John Cena vs Kurt Angle By Far one of the best matches in 2003, Cena became a star that night and Kurt Angle Gets better and better each time he wrestles. If you like Smackdown PPV with good wrestling then buy No Mercy on DVD or VHS its worth till take care
