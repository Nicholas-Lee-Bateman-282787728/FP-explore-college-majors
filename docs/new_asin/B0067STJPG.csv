8494447,5,B0067STJPG,"How to sum up Game of the Year? A ""This is Spinal Tap"" for the RPG world is the best I can do.

This movie is quite simply hysterically funny, well acted and drawn from life in so many ways it is almost embarrassing.

The plot McGuffin is perhaps a little ill-defined, in that it involves a gaming group who wish to attend a gaming con and enter the Game of the Year competition, the winning of which will put all the players of that group in charge of a gaming company for one year. The issue is that they must register as a group and do so months ahead of time (though this requirement gets a bit confused at the end).

Shot as a documentary, we follow the various members of the group as their lives intersect and chip each others paintwork. Egos are wheeled out and bruised. Stupid arguments flare. Everyone takes themselves (and RPGs) too seriously.

It is wonderful fun and if you don't see at least one player you've personally met while indulging yourself in your RPG habit I'd be very surprised.

And there are a number of moments when I thought I would pass out from laughing. I won't spoil, but will just say ""Clip, clop"". You'll understand and hopefully be as delighted as I was once you've seen Game of the Year.

The scene in the Gamecon RPG room was absolute comedy gold. What am I saying; it was comedy mithril. And I've been in that game and I'll bet you have too.

The deleted scenes are also great, at least one of which left me wondering why it was deleted in the first place.

Do yourself a favor and grab this little gem. If you are any sort of gamer it will have you alternately wincing and crying with laughter.

[EDIT 10/11/17] I've now bought three copies of this movie; one for me and two as gifts for special friends in the RPG hobby. I recommend this frivolous waste of time to every game geek on the planet.[/EDIT]",1470614400,,1844,4.321739130434783

More like your neighbor, who has a group of people show up at his house around 5pm every sunday night, carrying what looks to be books, pizza and a six pack of cold-ones. If you would look in the small basement window this is what you would see. GAME OF THE YEAR!!!! I've been there, I've seen characters killed off, its not pretty, this movie captures all of this and more. The movie is shot in the vein of a haphazard documentary that centers around a group of gamers trying to win a contest for the reality TV show GOTY. Everyone with a good sense of humor and a touch of humility will love this movie. Even if you have no idea what a ten sided die looks like you can get into this movie. Well worth buying and one last thing........ CLIP.........CLOP.......  Don't get that????? buy it to get it....",1340496000,3,979,4.291891891891892
8494449,5,B0067STJPG,"Most RPG themed videos are either insulting to gamers or boring to everyone else.  There's a very thin band there in the middle where Game of the Year sits.  It's an earnestly funny movie, but not ""wacky"", it's about gaming but it's not silly.  It shows gamers like the really are, as average people who play games and do real people stuff.  A few bits are a little long, falling into the Melies-esque trap of ""you all run around and do something until something happens"", but these blemishes are few.

If you play games, or love someone who does, then this is for you.  Or them.  Seriously dude, just show the cover art to a gamer and watch 'em wow.",1328745600,2,650,4.366666666666666
