8119043,2,B000F8OI96,"First off, I love Sean Young (Bladerunner, Headspace) and John Savage (The Killing Kind). Unfortunately, THE DROP isn't a very engaging movie. The premise sounds interesting enough, it just doesn't play out well. Michael Bondies drives the car from San Francisco to LA, never realizing that he is transporting pure eeeevil in the trunk. Once he arrives at his destination, I was expecting things to really get going. Well, he sits in a parking garage, watching people stroll by, for what seems like an eon. Then, the badguys show up. Hooray! At last, some action! Yep, they run around the parking structure for yet another eternity! Savage acts menacing. Young is semi-mysterious, while looking beautiful. The only problem is that nothing actually happens until the end. I gave this an extra star due to the bizarre atmosphere and the scene where Savage is dealt with...",1242864000,3,870,5.006896551724138
8119044,2,B000F8OI96,"Although the concept of this movie is remotely interesting, and may be enough to make the movie aficionado look at renting this movie, I caution you about doing so. The movie revolves around a college student who takes a job delivering a luxury car across the state of California. He does not, however, search the trunk until he's reached his destination. In the parking garage where the delivery is to be picked up, he finds a briefcase in the trunk. And, like any curious college student, he opens it. What he finds inside is supposed to be evil...but also lacks imagination and is the point where the movie takes a downward spiral. The movie is laden with interspliced scenes that were no doubt meant to give it an artistic feel, but only add to the confusion and boredom of the film over all. The acting is subpar, if not terrible in most cases. The performances are dry and overly dramaticized to an almost comical and campy degree, while the dialogue is stale and rank with an attempt to once more make this film seem artistic. Over all, this is a very poor attempt at what had the promise to be an entertaining motion picture. It fell far short, however. And if you have the courage to rent this film, you will no doubt find the ending as nonsensical and anticlimactic as I did. My recommendation? Don't bother wasting your time on this movie. And if you do, you do so at your own risk.",1153699200,3,1393,4.488188976377953
8119045,5,B000F8OI96,"A salesman at Blockbuster recommended the movie.  I thought it was superb and the acting, particularly the young protagonist who gets caught up in the dark plot, was great.  The tension that you felt, as each character seemed isolated in his own world, was well developed.  The dialogue was a little slow in places but Sean Young and Michael Bondies handled their parts well.",1151884800,4,375,4.828125
