4128637,3,B003J216JU,"""Appointment with Danger,"" released in 1951, showcased a small group of federal law enforcement officers, Postal Inspectors.  Alan Ladd starred, but fans of police dramas will enjoy seeing Jack Webb and Harry Morgan performing together, prefiguring their partnership on the TV series ""Dragnet,"" but with an unexpected role reversal.  In this film noir, the two are the criminals.

As the U.S. Postal Service faces bankruptcy, the introductory scenes that show the U.S. Postal Service of 1950 are absorbing.  Because nabbing the bad guys depends on the testimony of a nun, there are scenes of churches and convents that open a window of memory on the pre-Vatican II Catholic church.  The respect given to Catholic sisters at that time comes through nicely in the film.

This is a relatively quiet crime film with a heist subplot, but without any car chase, exploding vehicles, or ghastly crime.  How satisfying!

4128638,5,B003J216JU,"This 1950 film noir stars Alan Ladd, Phyllis Calvert, and Paul Stewart. The plot is pretty hokey and the first few minutes of the film seem like an infomercial for the U.S. Post Office, but this film gets very entertaining very fast.

Two thugs murder a U.S. Postal Inspector and then dump his body. A nun (Calvert) inadvertently sees the thugs. Al Goddard (Ladd), another U.S. Postal Inspector, investigates the murder by first locating the nun. After he finds her, he tracks down one of the killers and subsequently infiltrates the killers' gang.

There is plenty of snappy dialogue and a lot of funny lines. Goddard is a hard and determined man and is accused by a fellow officer of being inhuman and without feelings. The fellow officer says to Goddard, ""You don't know what a love affair is."" Goddard replies, ""It's what goes on between a man and a .45 that won't jam.""

Ironically, this film stars Jack Webb and Harry Morgan as the killers. Just two years later, Webb would begin starring on television as Detective Joe Friday on Dragnet. And in the late 1960s, Webb would team with Morgan again when Dragnet returned to television - and they dressed in just the same style as they did in the 1950 film.

I saw this film for the first time last summer and I liked it so much that I saw it again this winter. If you like old movies, this is a good one, and if you don't, you may like it anyhow.",1309910400,5,1399,4.453125
4128639,2,B003J216JU,"No question I am a film noir aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various <em>film noir</em> efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy; films like Out Of the Past, Gilda, The Lady From Shang-hai, and The Big Sleep need no additional comment from me as they stand on their own merits. I would add here a couple of earlier Alan Ladd vehicles, the film adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key and This Gun For Hire both also starring classic femme fatale Veronica Lake (be still my heart, sorry Rita Hayworth). Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, femme fatale to muddy the waters also get a pass, or as in Gilda a double nod for the plot and for the <em>femme fatale</em>, Rita Hayworth. Be still my heart, am I forgiven, Rita Hayworth? I have even tried to salvage some by touting their plot lines, and others by there use of shadowy black and white cinematography to overcome plot problems. Like The Third Man (and, in that case, the edgy musical score, with all the zither music you could want or need, as well). And that brings us to those, like this film under review, 1951's Appointment With Danger, starring the above-mentioned Alan Ladd that have no redeeming film noir qualities.

Now as I mentioned in a recent review of another lesser crime noir, William Holden in Union Station, it is not like Alan Ladd did not know how to play hard-boiled crime noir on either side of the crime line as he did in The Glass Key and This Gun For Hire (as well as the Raymond Chandler-scripted The Blue Dahlia) so it is not the acting capabilities, although Brother Ladd may have been a little tired from holding Veronica Lake's hand (or playing playfully with that big wavy hair falling over her right eye). What is missing here in the film under review, Appointment With Danger, is any spark to get interested in actors or plot.

The plot line in any case is rather conventional. Ladd plays a hard-nosed postal inspector (what? yes a postal inspector, and hard-nosed to boot) who is sent out to crime-ridden Indiana to seek the killer, or killers, of a fellow postal inspector (what?, again a postal inspector-who would have known it was such a dangerous life) and the only clue that he has to go on is via a sister, no not a dame, a nun who can identify (and be identified by) one of the men last seen with said postal inspector. Between the pair hard-boiled, obviously Protestant, postal inspector with a narrow sense of his job, and narrower regard for the human species and Catholic nun good who sees only good, Ladd tumbles into a big time heist, a million dollar heist (that was big dough ten, if only pocket change now) involving the postal service. Is nothing sacred?

Part of the tumbling by Ladd is that he gets inside the job through wit, wiliness, and an occasional drawing of the gun, although this is the weakest part of a weak plot. If one assumes a certain amount of finesse by Earl, a hotel owner looking for, well, looking for ""easy street"" and an end to changing towels for the masses, then Ladd's working his way into the scheme should have put out signals big time. Moreover some of Earl's confederates have more than a few problems, especially the combination that later in the decade would do yeomen's service as detectives in Dragnet (Jack Webb and Harry Morgan). Of course in this one the message was telegraphed from the very beginning, crime doesn't pay, especially if you go after the big boys, the postal service. Or people who walk around with guardian angels to protect them.

Note: As is usual with crime-addled guys they need their molls, sometimes gun molls, but sometimes just for company in the sometimes long wait between jobs. Here the moll, a blonde one as well, although blondeness is not required for the job, just the craven desire for a share of the ""easy street"" dough is played by the same moll from Union Station, Jan Sterling. Ms. Sterling actually ""steals"" the show here as the hard-boiled but smart ""be-bop"" moll with the quick answer who also has enough sense to come in out of the rain. In short, to know when the deal goes down that her man, Earl, ain't going nowhere fast and so she blows town, just in time. Nice work. But this is where my interest was perked; she also was into the 1950s be-bop jazz night and brought tin-eared Ladd up to her digs to listen to some platters. If Brother Ladd had had any sense he would have followed her out of town. Willingly.",1308700800,2,4583,4.565006075334144

4128641,4,B003J216JU,"Paramount Pictures presents ""APPOINTMENT WITH DANGER"" (1951) (89 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Alan Ladd, Phyllis Calvert, Paul Stewart, Jan Sterling, Jack Webb & Harry Morgan

Directed by Lewis Allen

Relentless postal inspector Al Goddard is sent to Gary, Indiana, when another officer is murdered. He must find the nun who witnessed the murder, then infiltrate the gang by convincing them he is a postal inspector gone bad. This is a great Alan Ladd crime drama with interesting support from Jack Webb & Harry Morgan as the villains!

Jack Webb and Harry Morgan (Sgt. Joe Friday and Officer Bill Gannon in a future life) are members of the gang. Webb's character is particularly vicious, and he kills Morgan with a pair of bronze baby shoes!

Appointment with Danger is a fast moving, entertaining, punch in the gut of a movie. In spite of its obscurity Appointment is a crime film of the first order. It's a textbook example of the visual aspects of the noir style.

4128642,2,B003J216JU,"This 1951 ""noir"" (?) starring Alan Ladd was nothing more than a 1930s style crime drama starring George Raft right down to the boring monotone voice.
The movie started with this voiceover glorification of the Postal service employees and inspectors to the point of silliness, then typical hero (Ladd) infiltrating the bad guys and saving the day.
The one bright point was seeing Jack Webb & Henry Morgan driving around in a car together just like Dragnet.",1291507200,,455,4.922077922077922
4128643,4,B003J216JU,"An end of the scale Hollywood film noir that was a typical 50s response to television's impact & tighter productions. A pre-Dragnet style film that happens to have two future Dragnet actors in its cast: Jack Webb & Harry Morgan - now we know where Webb got the idea. Ladd is as good as always playing a tough guy with a soft streak; I don't know why more Ladd films are not available on DVD, he was an outstanding hero figure for the 40s & 50s without ever being abusive to women, unlike others like Cagney, Bogart and Robinson. Phyllis Calvert is super in a very pre-""Indiscreet"" role.",1283558400,3,586,4.435185185185185
4128644,4,B003J216JU,"This is a good, well filmed thriller about investigators of the Postal Service. What attracted me the most were the scenes filmed on location in Gary, Indiana. I learned about this town and its actual state from Larry Cohen's Original Gangstas. Some of the locations I could revisit in this movie, specially the railroad station.
Appointment With Danger also includes a very suspenseful, extremely well filmed heist scene in Gary.",1283472000,,430,5.1571428571428575
4128645,4,B003J216JU,"""Appointment with Danger"" begins like a typical post-war propaganda film in the guise of a thriller. A voiceover narration sings the praises of a law enforcement agency. In this case, we learn how big and efficient the US Postal Service is thanks to the dedication of ""a great army of men and women"". We're introduced to ""the nation's oldest police force"": postal inspectors. Then we're whisked to Gary, Indiana where a postal inspector by the name of Henry Gruber has been murdered. The introduction would lead the audience to believe this is going to be a police procedural, but it's not. It sticks to narrative mode for the rest of the film. Another postal inspector, Al Goddard (Alan Ladd), has been sent to track down the nun, Sister Augustine (Phyllis Calvert), who saw Gruber's killers. Goddard is a hardened, cynical man who goes undercover to catch the murderers as they heist a mail truck carrying $1 million.

It's classified as ""film noir"", but ""Appointment with Danger"" is only superficially so. Al Goddard has lots of great, hardboiled lines. He doesn't get on well with people and trusts no one. ""One way or another, everybody you meet is a pitch artist,"" he says. There are a couple of brutal scenes. And Goddard's ability to make the suspects think he's even more crooked than they are introduces an aspect of identity confusion. But Goddard is never confused or conflicted. ""Appointment with Danger"" doesn't take place in the noir universe. Nevertheless, Goddard's hard-boiled persona is a lot of fun, as is the film's conspicuous attempt to cast Ladd as a tough-guy sex symbol -love the shirtless squash game between Goddard and violent conspirator Joe Regas (Jack Webb). Regas' persistent paranoia about the nun is a disaster waiting to happen.

Sister Augustine, who thinks Goddard could be a nice man with a little practice, is too angelic in contrast to the cynical cop and cold-blooded criminals. Earl Boettiger (Paul Stewart), a hotelier who masterminds the heist seems almost too level-headed for the part. Between him, the too-precious nun, and Goddard's aloofness, the film has a flat tone that keeps it just shy of completely engaging the audience. Earl's mistress Dodie (Jan Sterling) is a counterpoint to that tone. She's not in many scenes, but she produces a terrific combination of vulnerability, resignation, and  realpolitik when she confronts Goddard. ""Appointment with Danger"" could have been better if it had been willing to explore its character's bizarre behavior a little more, but it's still entertaining. The print on the Olive Films 2010 DVD is pretty good but no bonus features or subtitles.",1281571200,22,2637,5.043577981651376
4128646,4,B003J216JU,"A good movie. If you like Alan Ladd, you will like this movie.
It is not as good as, This Gun for Hire or The Blue Dahlia, but a good four star movie.

4128647,5,B003J216JU,"This film, released in 1951, received the Mystery Writers of America award for best mystery film of the year.  It is a mystery and something of a police procedural, not an action adventure film.  However, plenty of bullets fly before its all over.  Allan Ladd plays a quiet, soft spoken, cynical, tough guy postal inspector to great effect.  The costars and supporting cast are outstanding.  Jack Webb and Harry Morgan are partners in this movie, with Webb playing a character named Joe but not Friday.  Unfortunately for coincidence, Morgan's character is named neither Bill nor Gannon.  They have a relationship which foreshadows the interaction of their characters in the later Dragnet TV series except that instead of police officers, they are hardened criminals and murderers in this one.

My first thought open listening to the film's prologue was that the producer was trying to do for the Postal Inspectors what the FBI STORY did for the G-men.  But, even though both Jimmy Stewart and Alan Ladd are both soft spoken investigators, this is a completely different, darker kind of movie.  A thing to think of while watching, is just how much money a million dollars was in 1951.  I streamed this via Amazon Prime so can not address the quality of any dvd's which may be available.",1454284800,,1286,4.880184331797235

Mostly this movie is striking to me because of the realness of the filming.  It wasn't necessarily done in a studio and the settings gave it the gritty feel it deserved.  Alan Ladd,as always, nails it.  The bickering and later fatal duo of our iconic Webb and Morgan was a great aside.  The late 40's early 50's Paramount crime dramas were and are my favorite.  Too bad Universal Pictures owns the Paramount movie catalog up to the mid 50's.  They don't put out nearly enough of them for the public to view, rent or stream.",1416873600,,636,4.575221238938053
4128665,5,B003J216JU,I've watched this movie several times. It's my favorite Alan Ladd performance after This Gun for Hire. I especially liked subtle symbols in the production. For instance when Sr. Augustine (Phyllis Calvert) and her companion leave the restaurant after identifying Soderquist (Harry Morgan) they are followed by Regas (Jack Webb). When Sr. Augustine turns in his direction searching for a cab she is standing behind a mailbox. When she gets in the cab a policeman holds the door for her. The Post Office and the Police are protecting her. Nice touch. I like the characters. Jan Sterling is darling as Dodie. Paul Stewart as Earl is a very likeable ring leader. Goddard's (Ladd) conversion from a bitter cynical man to one with a personal stake in the case develops nicely especially through a .45 pistol that doesn't jam. A point comes when he offers his life to save Sr. Augustine. It carries all the themes of putting the well being of another before your own and the healing it offers. It is a very satisfying movie.

4128668,5,B003J216JU,"I suspect this excellent 50s noir yarn was overlooked because of its yawning industrial documentary opening (to get federal approval) about the 'dangerous' world of the postal department. However, after a brief yawn or blink of eye, the homicide of a postal worker leads the responsible thugs on the chase to silence a nun(Phyllis Calvert),an innocent eyewitness to the homicide. Enters the focused postal inspector Al Goddard (Alan Ladd)who attempts to ferret the reason to the homicide. Playing the two thugs are a young Jack Webb and his sentimental psycho sidekick Harry Morgan. As things progress Goddard wiles his way into the den of thieves,(pretense as a corrupted inspector) headed by Paul Stewart, the mastermind with his mistress (Jan Sterling). She refers to herself as a ""stenographer.""By the time Goddard is deeply within this group he faces imminent danger of exposure as an impostor/thug or merely the target of pathologically sadistic Webb. Goddard cleverly embeds himself, skirting danger several times by deftly manipulating situations to his advantage and this is when the laughs begin, with several hilarious comments dropped by Goddard. Try this one: Paul Stewart strolls into the hotel cafeteria the following morning after warning Goddard of the dangers of being a fraud and asks the newspaper-reading Goddard, ""How was the food?"" Goddard lowering the newspaper says blandly,""As good as the company."" When the gang moves forward on their caper/heist swallowing Goddard's reasons they decide to take in some handball at the gym. Stewart bows out but lets the beefier Jack Webb deliver some blows to Goddard (Ladd) casually. After a couple casual blows to Goddard while playing hand ball(fit, athletic here) Ladd cold-cocks Webb. The way he dumps ice on Webb from waist-high adding, ""Yeah I hate to see him in such pain,"" is hilarious. This is a smart, hilarious battle of wits surpassing many film-noir films. Once Goddard's line is bought you are in for a wonderful ride showing you that a""This Gun For Hire""-caliber follow-up was no fluke, even without a tempting Veronica Lake. Phyllis Calvert plays a wonderful nun who almost talks loner Goddard back into the fold, telling him, ""..without a little practice you could be almost human."" At the finish, Goddard(Ladd) agrees.

It is never more so than when said investigator is doggedly on the trail of vicious criminals wanted for the murder of a fellow postal inspector. And, sadly, because that worthy crime-fighter is really, really dedicated to the job, he is without a social life, much less amorous entanglements. (Well, there maybe a very platonic diversion with a witness who happens to be a nun...but, still, what stoic isolation is born by this incredible man!)

Actually, this movie is fairly forgettable...the only true highlight is the occasional appearance of a young Bill Gannon/Colonel Potter (Harry Morgan).",1387497600,,805,5.184615384615385

4128686,4,B003J216JU,"Having driven through Gary, Indiana on my way to Michigan several times, it is every bit as industrial and gritty looking as it looked over 50 years ago when this movie was filmed.  If this movie was not filmed in Indiana, I would be surprised.  The overhead bridges, metal and industrial areas look so authentic in the outdoor scenes, I don't know how the filmmakers would have re-created this on a soundstage back in Hollywood.  The scenery is urban and cinematically fascinating -- well worth your time to give this movie a look.

Alan Ladd is perfect as the tough guy who is trying to fight crime.  And, Jack Webb as an unlikeable character gives the movie some sparkle.  I thoroughly enjoyed this new DVD release tremendously.  MASH fans will recognize a young Harry Morgan in the supporting cast.",1327449600,,802,4.726618705035971

Stars: 4

Pros:
- Story is complex but easy to follow (so, does that make it not complex...dunno)
- Acting is good in general
- Largely believable (I watched it thinking it was a true story
- Dragnet duo

Cons:
-No real cons, just not a Wow type of movie

I enjoyed this movie. I think that the actors are what made it.  I found that they were believable but still had a fair amount of ""character"".  It was fairly tense too.  I cared what happened to everyone (that is important to me) Good movie to sit through on a slow  night.",1461888000,3,557,4.19811320754717
