The casting, in particular, is the most perfect I can remember seeing in any TV show ever.  The final three episodes, which form one continuous story, are absolutely electrifying.

Start with the black-and white episodes from Network DVD and watch the whole thing from start to finish.

BUT &mdash; the copy I received contained (and was designed to contain) only the four (4) CDs of the TV series; it did NOT contain the movie.",1266278400,,679,4.728813559322034
8250601,4,B0013EGV32,"Callan conveys a realistic atmosphere of espionage, especially during the cold war.  More recent, technically sophisticated productions full of electronic gadgets and smart talk (e.g. NCIS) do not match it for realism.  Callan has less display of violence than in current productions, but the violence, or threat of it, in Callan is more chilling.  It is regrettable that the early series (in black and white) is no longer available",1252022400,2,432,5.231884057971015
