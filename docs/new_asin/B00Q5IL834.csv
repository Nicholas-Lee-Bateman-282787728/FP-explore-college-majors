6854636,5,B00Q5IL834,"The Dvd arrived on time, and hears the deal in a nut shell as they say. No that i'am 67yrs old, I appreciate all the old things
and history. I've heard about Pop Corn Sutton for years. Watched soom programs on the history channel I believe about him.
I found his story on youtube and decided I needed to know more. I got a copy of the book he wrote, and one written by his
Daughter about his life. If your shopping for info on him get the dvd (  The Last One  ). It goes into detail on how he use to
make his stills. Popcorn was a real craftsman of his time. The stills he built were built right as not to poison anyone, because
the were built out of copper. Some people tried to go cheap and use galvanized pipe instead. Not good at all. Popcorn not
only made the best Moonshine, but also thought about the people he sold his product to. I was just informed a couple weeks
ago that this new dvd came out. Popcorn Sutton - A Hell of a Life. Well I jumped right on the band and sent for this Dvd. So,
If you haven't seen The Last One, you need to. And if you have then you need to buy A Hell of a Life. Oh Ya !!!! Popcorn in
a Big Bowl goes real good with Popcorn on the screen. Check them both out. A+++++++++++",1420502400,9,1211,3.9186991869918697

8690433,5,B00Q5IL834,"A hell of a documentary. Popcorn is as lively as ever, and his one liners are second to none. This is a look into the life of the man. It isn't a how to video. If you're going into this looking for a high quality picture and refined filming techniques, this isn't for you. As a matter of fact, if you're that person, you don't deserve to watch this anyway. My advice to film nerds is to read Popcorn's foot marker at his grave.",1448841600,5,427,4.095238095238095
