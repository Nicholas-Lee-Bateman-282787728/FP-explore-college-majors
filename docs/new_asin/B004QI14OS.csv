8438128,1,B004QI14OS,"Check this out y'all. This movie is the same exact movie as Cheaters, they changed the name, cover and description of the movie to make it seem as if it was 2 different movies. What a Janky marketing scheme. Not worth the price at all. But i give it 1 star for effort. Bad marketing....hope the film maker sees this review. I will never support a black film maker again. Except for Tyler Perry and i'm getting tired of his s*** also.",1382140800,,433,4.2926829268292686
