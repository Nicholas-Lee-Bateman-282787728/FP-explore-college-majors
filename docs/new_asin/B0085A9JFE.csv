5132745,5,B0085A9JFE,"We purchased this video for my son after finding the videos online.  He loves firemen and rescues (probably because daddy is a fireman).  I've read several reviews on the Fireman Sam videos criticizing the children in the video.  While the children depicted in the video are constantly getting into trouble, and Norman is certainly not a good example, the correction offered to the children from the adults gets the message across.  And there are several good lessons about being near the water, hiking in the mountains, etc.  These are also very safe videos if your child is hitting the stage where they are afraid of things (monsters in the closet, etc.)  the videos don't feed the imagination with more things to be afraid of like some videos.  Overall the Fireman Sam series is a good purchase.",1358726400,,798,4.823529411764706
