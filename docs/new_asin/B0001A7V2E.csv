1983047,2,B0001A7V2E,"Call me old fashioned, but I prefer the original Scooby Doos.  These new ones just get a little scary for little ones and are a little too dark.  I don't like that the ""monster"" is not always a person in a costume like in the originals. I know it is only a cartoon, but I don't think some of this content is good for very young children.  My 8 year old loves this, my 6 and 3 year olds are frightened by it and won't be in the same room when it is on.",1168300800,,451,3.776595744680851
