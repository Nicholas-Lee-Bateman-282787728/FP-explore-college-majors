3010380,5,B000Y0H15I,These brought me way back!  Helped me fill in the holes in my collection.  Now have 1-152.  These came in a bubble pouch or cardboard sleeve which did its job just seemed a little flimsy,1358640000,,186,4.257142857142857
3010381,4,B000Y0H15I,"I collect ufc events this may not have the best fights, but its a solid deal. I would recommend it.",1358553600,,99,4.0
3010382,3,B000Y0H15I,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights.  I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's.  It became just another DVD to the collection.",1349222400,,183,3.918918918918919
3010383,5,B000Y0H15I,"Great set of UFCs! 1 through 10 are gems just for the fact that it was a new American sport and no1 knew what to expect. 11- 20, u still see alot of one dimensional fighters, but u can see it becomes more astablished with better announcers, fighters and fans. To any fan of how the american MMA has evolved and any1 who just wants to see some amazing fights, this is for u. 21- 30 are next on my list. Those were amazing events as well",1342569600,,435,4.011494252873563
3010384,3,B000Y0H15I,"This is essentially a bootleg copy of UFC 11-20 that looks like an OK VHS transfer, and if you're really into the UFC, this is currently your only option.  But be warned, the production value of the DVDs is pretty low as this was obviously homemade, but it does have all of the fights advertised, which are 5 star all the way. Unfortunately since an official release isn't available, you have to pay a ridiculous price for something mass produced in a basement in China.  Just be aware that although you get all the fights - and that they are all great - you are NOT getting an official release - it should sell for a lot less.",1338508800,9,627,4.305084745762712
3010385,5,B000Y0H15I,"This is the cheapest and most efficient way to get many of these releases.  Since Zuffa only released UFC 11 & 12, most of these events were long ago discontinued.  For most fans this is the only way to get these events.  There are a ton of classic fights on this set (Coleman vs. Severn, Mo Smith vs. Coleman, the debuts of of Couture and Belfort, etc).

Now the bottom line is this are just the events as they aired on PPV (no prelim fights).  Don't expect any extras either.  Also, these are old events.  Most fans are used to watching events in HD but these happened long before HD was an option.

Like I said, this is a great set for what it is, great fights....but don't expect much more",1329004800,2,693,4.236641221374046
3010386,1,B000Y0H15I,I was very disappointed to find out that these box sets are bootleg DVDs. These are not official UFC releases.,1323993600,2,110,4.55
3010387,5,B000Y0H15I,"It is a bare bones collection with no extra features but that's fine since the fights are what we are here for and that is what we get.

I watched this using my PS3 with HDMI cable on a 47 inch LCD tv and it looks absolutely fine. Of course it look old but the visual quality is good and so is the sound. So anyone who is worried that the quality may not be bearable, do not worry. It is similar to the quality of the UFC Classics Collection DVDs.

It is a great buy for anyone who is interested in the evolution of MMA and the UFC.",1312502400,5,532,3.871559633027523
3010388,5,B000Y0H15I,"Like previous comments, this is bare bones (no extra features or anything like that).  But, the trade off is that you pay 6 bucks a ufc instead of $12 if you order them separately.

The quality is good enough (keep in mind when it was taped).  11-20 is when you really see the change in fighting styles and even the rules (plus the commentary is a little more bearable).  ""hybrids"" start to emerge.  Randy C., Vitor B., Tito and others debut in this set.",1284163200,7,454,4.357142857142857
3010389,4,B000Y0H15I,"This is pretty much a bare-bones collection (no extras or fancy graphics) but it's still a cool piece of MMA history.
It's the Euro pay-per-view feed of cards 11-20.
Since the UFC doesnt seem to be that concerned with reissuing all of their early cards, I picked this bad boy up while I could still find it - and I think you should too!
Definately check EBAY if Amazon's price doesnt suite you. I foulnd this set for about $30.00 cheaper, and that included shipping.",1231459200,9,466,4.4941176470588236
