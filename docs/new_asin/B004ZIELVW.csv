8449815,1,B004ZIELVW,"Alison Thompson's story is one gigantic lie.
Alison Thompson walked into Paraliya in early 2005, amply cleavaged and with a camera team in tow, where she found a makeshift hospital run by a crew of volunteers from Hamelin, Gemany. Thompson simply took over the operation and claimed it as her own, by finding a vacant building and moving the Hospital there with the aid of her crew of four, while she was asked to stay on watch. Then she set up a large sign rechristening it from ""Hameln Hospital"" into a name of her choosing.
Meanwhile, the actual license to run the hospital was procured by the Germans, and it remained running under their name, so they would have to shoulder consequences in case of malpractise (luckily, no such cases happened - amazing, if you consider that the Hamelin team treated more than 18000 patients). Even the medical supplies Thompson claims to have brought in came from the German crew. Thompson and her entourage did nothing except referring patients to the Germans, who then treated them.
In the meantime, Thompson stood outside the hospital tent giving pompous interviews while the Germans were inside the hospital, too busy aiding the injured to produce a favourable image of themselves for the media (note the careful makeup Thompson is wearing on most photos in the middle of disaster). Thompson herself apparently never treated one single patient, in spite of her claims of being a professional nurse.
Also, it's quite doubtful the self-styled ""body collector"" collected one single body with her own hands *off camera*. After one day of showing off herself moving bodies for the film, she preferred to let others continue the dirty work (which they had already started two weeks prior to her arrival, at 40 degrees centigrade) for her while she styled herself as the ""Angel of Paralya"". On the photo that shows Ms Thompson helping to move a body *on camera* you can see the arm of one of the people who did the actual work. These men and women were hardly as much as mentioned in her account (they do show up as ""also-rans"" on her website, however, where her own crew gets extensive credits).
All of these very successful attempts at self-aggrandisement went into Ms Thompson's book and this film, which was screened on festivals worldwide. Evidently, she had gone to Sri Lanka specifically in order to portray herself as a very public ""saint"". Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. One thing that Ms Thompson has going for herself is an immense aptitude at self-marketing: She is, indeed, a very convincing liar. Hypocritical and disgusting in the extreme.",1330560000,5,2610,4.893905191873589

8449818,5,B004ZIELVW,"When I watched this documentary for the first time, I was moved beyond words.  To see what one person and a heart of gold can do was so amazing to me.  I have since watched it about a dozen times and I get something new from it each time.  I used to think to myself what can one person do?  Some of these disasters are so HUGE, that it can make you feel helpless.  Alison Thompson shows you that one motivated person can make a huge impact on thousands of people's lives, and personally got me involved in Haiti.  This movie chronicles her time in Sri Lanka with the help of a few friends, rebuilt a town, saved countless lives and developed the first Tsunami early warning system in Sri Lanka.  What started out as a trip that was supposed to last 10 days turned out to be an inspiration to thousands.  Truly one of the best documentaries I have ever seen, and the book which covers before and after Sri Lanka is an amazing read as well.",1311206400,4,938,4.230337078651686
