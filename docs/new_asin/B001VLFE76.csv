3822685,5,B001VLFE76,"This trilogy set includes the Underworld: Extended Edition.  Why make a seperate cut just for the box set (I don't think they did)?  I think it's safe to say it is identical to the already released Underworld Unrated Extended edition that's out on bluray.

So if you already have the other titles, no need to buy a box set that's basically just packaging them all together.

But if you only saw one of the movies and liked it, you definately need to see the rest.",1242086400,61,463,4.411764705882353
3822686,4,B001VLFE76,"My wife and I are both HUGE fans of the ""Underworld"" movies and were ecstatic to hear that ""Rise of the Lycans"" finally had a DVD release date. We were even happier to hear that the trilogy was being released in it's own offical Box Set.

HOWEVER....

When reading over the specifications for the box set, I noticed that the version of ""Underworld"" included is the R-rated version and not the UNRATED version, which is the version that I already have.

If you plan on buying this trilogy (being the purist that I am), I would recommend that, in the event you already have the UNRATED version of ""Underworld"", you just swap the movies over, one for the other, and get rid of the R-rated version in the triolgy box set.

In the event the version of ""Underworld"" contained in the box set is BOTH the UNRATED AND the R-rated (both versions in the package), you'll be fine.

Just wanted to make everyone aware of this before you purchase.

(I gave the box set 4 stars because all 3 movies are fantastic. I would have given this 5 stars if I knew for sure that the UNRATED version of ""Underworld"" was included in it.)",1238716800,14,1111,4.421568627450981

3822759,5,B001VLFE76,"I am not sure if this has been brought up before but the story makeup of Underworld at first glance kind of reminded me of the story of Romeo and Juliet. Selene a death dealer and fierce vampire warrior who is often denied being with Michael Corvin because he is a lycan (werewolf in the films). Then this otherworldly and deadly war where these two sides vampires and lycans are trying to kill each other. How can one not? Yet, it should be pointed out that too bad for William Shakespeare the original is not always better. Sometimes it gets surpassed as is the case with Underworld. Underworld, at least, the first film is much like the story of Romeo and Juliet but in a Supernatural/Horror world making it more sexy stylistically. It's wonderful from the reflective narrative voice-overs of Selene played by Kate Beckinsale to the dressware of the high and mighty vampires.

In Underworld: Evolution. Next after the events of Underworld, we have Selene hoping to bring an end to the pursuit of her and Michael by Marcus, a vampire elder instrumental in Underworld only for Marcus to turn against her out of wanting to free his brother, William. Unfortunately for everyone William could never be released due to his insatiably hunger for destruction.

And it is with Underworld: Evolution one sees why the often small, but there lengthiness becomes necessary. Every little piece in Underworld was needed to set up the events that will transpire in Underworld: Evolution. So by the time one reaches Underworld: Evolution one can just move into a more action-heavy film which is where Underworld: Evolution really succeeds. It actually gains an improvement. Even so, Underworld: Evolution doesn't skim on story, the interesting things, that appear in Underworld: Evolution is the tracing and discovering of the true originators of the vampires and lycans. Meanwhile, Selene and Michael's romantic relationship is developed quite strongly to what it was meant to be from the beginning.

As to Underworld: Rise of the Lycans that goes way, way back into the lies Viktor kept from Selene and many other vampires.",1462579200,,2111,4.974504249291785

but the packaging is garbage!
all 3 movies stacked on top of each other on one peg.
that kind of packaging is cheap, lazy and it could potentially ruin the discs!
thankfully they weren't scratched when I pulled them out.
I was lucky enough to have an extra case with a flip tray that I wasn't using.
I just switched out the case and threw the old one away.
if not for the packaging, I would've rated it 5 stars.
no damage was done; but still, it's the principal of the matter.

3822883,5,B001VLFE76,"Absolutely RIVETING!  Each Video kept me breathlessly waiting for the next brilliant move. I couldn't believe the story line. Most of these are so boringly done to death that you buy the video more for the captivating picture on the cover than for the actual DVD content. I didn't even know who the actors were who played in this DVD. I had never heard of them. I still haven't. I couldn't tell you their names if you asked me.
I now own all 4 of the set. I assume there are no more. If there are more, someone please say something, for I will die never knowing unless I stumble across it. That is exactly how I found these. It was a stumble. Looking for the best price. I am a cheapskate. I have to be. I live on next to nothing and spend only what I must to eat. The rest goes to my video library.  Walmart sometimes has a $2.98 Blu-Ray bin at the back of the store. I will take my WalMart wheelchair and go back there, and sit for maybe 2 hrs. straightening up that bin, getting it all arranged real pretty in return, it gives me a chance to dig all the way down in there to see what they have and whether it's worth digging for. They are almost all 2 movies per disc and they want a review for each disc so a lot of them are first timers, but sometimes, u get good ones.
That is where I found the fourth issue of this series which led me to you and that is why I ""got off the subject"",.Or so you thought.
I would not have come to Amazon and spent the money on the Trilogy even though the price was not only amazingly fair, it was surprisingly so. I fully expected to pay double what I did, and would have done so.
If I may be so bold as to make an advertising suggestion, if there is a legal way to use the Walmart price for the fourth in the set as a lead to your Trilogy set, I would get on it as soon as possible and ride that horse till it dies. And please, if there are more, LET ME KNOW!  Sooner rather than later.  Thank you,

Since a lot of the actors looked a lot alike, I had trouble differentiating between the werewolves and the vampires which caused some confusion during the battle scenes, unless the werewolves had turned into their wolf forms.

The last two movies have graphic nude sex scenes so you might not want young viewers around for scenes that were so uncovered and graphic that I think the second movie must have barely earned the ""R"" rating instead of an ""X"".

3822922,4,B001VLFE76,Vampires and Werewolves are the stuff of legends or stories to frighten those unaware.  At least that's we're told.  But maybe they live among us in a kind of separate universe known only to themselves and those unlucky (or lucky) enough to be bitten.  Kate Beckinsale and her tribe bring to life the tale of a child raised by vampires to be a death dealer to all not of their kind.  But other forces intrude and she cannot kill but must help the one person still able to bring the creatures together.  For this she becomes an outcast and as hunted as she herself hunted others.  These tales are as good as you will find in this genre.,1372896000,,635,4.338983050847458

3822928,3,B001VLFE76,"Like another reviewer here, my copy of ""Rise of the Lycans"" (Bluray) was so grainy I felt like I had been magically transported back into the 1970's!  Since ""Rise"" is such a recent movie I would have expected it to be the best of the three, but it was BY FAR the worst.  In fact, it is the worst bluray transfer I've ever seen.

For those of you who may have bought the older DVD transfer of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, I can tell you that this bluray was WORSE than that DVD was.  My 13 year old daughter kept asking me what was wrong with the TV because it looked so bad.

The other two movies were excellent, as you would expect in a bluray.  I don't understand how they could be of such relatively good quality and ""Rise"" could be so poor.",1365292800,,748,4.089041095890411

Sure enough, we got a prequel and 2 more movies full of kick-ass action and scary monsters. Anyone who loves vampires and is a bit of a science nerd, will likely appreciate the series. Kate Beckinsale rules the screen as the main character, Selene. Rhona Mitra steals the show as Sonia, in Rise of the Lycans. Bill NIghy is a terrifying and cruel Viktor, and Michael Sheen plays the believably tormented Lucian. I can watch these movies over and over and always enjoy them.",1357776000,,561,4.62

3822970,5,B001VLFE76,"Underworld Trilogy is three of the best! This is one of the best sets of vampires battling Lycans you will ever have the pleasure of watching. All three movies are action packed thrill rides with compelling storylines,amazing special effects,and all the blood and gore combined with sex appeal that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Selene(Kate Beckinsale) starts the series off as a death dealer in the vampire clan at war with the Lycans. Selene is the sexiest vampire vixen you will ever see and kick's ass from start to finish. The Lycan leader Lucian has a history with the vampire elder Viktor that Selene was unaware of to create a twist in the plot to find Michael Korban,the last decendent of alexander korvenus. The romance between Selene and Michael is built up through the movie and ends up in a suprise twist to the end of the first movie. Evolution continues the pairing of Selene and Michael in survival mode to stop a 2nd vampire elder from carrying out his plan to find his Lycan brother. Evolution continues with the compelling storyline and amazing action,blood,and gore. There is also a sweet sex scene between Selene and Michael where they finally show their love for one another. Rise of The Lycans is a prequel that shows how the vampires used the Lycans as slaves to protect them during the day. Lucian has a secret love with Viktor's daughter Sonja(Rhona Mitra) which sets up the feud between the two leaders. Viktor does an unforgivable act which sets up Lucian's quest for revenge and the Lycan's freedom. Rise Of The Lycans has all the action,amazing special effects,blood,gore,and sex appeal as the previous two. The story line is compelling and a thrill ride from start to finish.

3822973,2,B001VLFE76,"The movies so far as content are great, this is a warning for anyone planning to utilize Vudu to watch your Ultraviolet digital copies.

I bought the trilogy with the plan of streaming the Ultraviolet copies over my PS3 using Vudu.  The Ultraviolet redemption went fine and my account reflects I ""own"" all 3 films in high def format, but for some strange reason Sony and Vudu apparently didn't talk as the title ""Underworld"" only streams in standard definition on Vudu.  I would not have bought this trilogy if I had known that.  The other two titles look awesome streaming on Vudu in HD.  I called Sony, they blamed Vudu.  I called Vudu, they blamed Sony.  At least Sony Pictures said they'd look into it and and ""call me back if they found out anything"".  My Vudu support call was less ""optimistic"" from my viewpoint.  They told me to review their site before I bought anything to see if HD was available.  That kind of kills the whole concept of Ultraviolet in my opinion.  It also kind of kills my zeal to preorder any blu ray content Ultraviolet if I continue to use Vudu.

Prior to this episode I have been jazzed about Vudu.  Everything I have rented or bought streams flawlessly on my ethernet connected PS3 and my second wireless connected PS3 with awesome HD quality.

Yes, I can pop in the blu ray disc of Underworld in my Playstation and watch high def, but read the Ultraviolet terms closely as certain ""partners"" don't seem to consistently work well together.  All the risk appears to be on the consumer.  I plan to proceed more slowly into the Vudu/Ultraviolet world at this point.  The Ultraviolet product descriptions should show the video quality each streaming provider (Vudu, Flixster, Sony, Paramount etc) will be streaming the Ultraviolet copies so consumers know what they're getting.

3822991,5,B001VLFE76,"Now that the movie deal is over, I thought I should update my review.

TL;DR: Movies are awesome, watch Ultraviolet copies offline on iPad/iPhone using Flixter App

This review is for the Underworld Blu-ray Trilogy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld-Trilogy-Underworld-Underworld-Evolution-Underworld-Rise-of-the-Lycans-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B005MYEPSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld Trilogy (Underworld / Underworld: Evolution / Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>]) that includes the unrated extended version of the first Underworld and a bonus disc of material. As others reviewers have mentioned this movies looks and sounds incredibly good on Blu-ray and I'm sure you will not regret purchasing this box-set. If you're on the fence about buying this, I really can't recommend it enough, even if you're new to Underworld, you'll get immediately 'hooked' to this great movie franchise.

As far as the Ultraviolet digital version of the movies, I don't love it, but it works OK. A lot of people complained that Ultraviolet was only for streaming, but I was able to download the movies to my computer with no issues (it worked on my Mac but I imagine it should work on PC as well). If you want to download to you iPad/iPhone you need to use an application called Flixter (The app is called Movies on Android ->&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Movies/dp/B004HXHVZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Movies</a>) and then you need to create an account at the Flixter website ([...]) and link it to your Ultraviolet account and voila! you can download your movies to you iPad/iPhone or Android device for offline viewing (no internet connection required).",1328832000,,1794,6.196787148594377
3822992,5,B001VLFE76,I like this saga. It keeps one interested from the beginning to the end. I can't wait for the new one that is coming out.,1328659200,,121,3.88
3822993,4,B001VLFE76,"I love the Underworld series. Although the story did not go as I expected in Underworld Evolution, and some characters just cease to exist without much purpose (Amelia), the movies are great overall. I specially liked Rise of the Lycans. It's almost as if I've watched it before in anoter form, but it was really good and kept me entertained the entire time. The quality is top notch as expected of a BluRay release for this quality movies. I do wish I would have waited a little longer for the other ""Collector's Edition"" set, but I got this for a great price during Black Friday and can't complain.

RECOMMENDED",1328572800,,613,4.623853211009174
3822994,5,B001VLFE76,"The Underworld series is one of my favourite film franchises, as movies bringing my favourite monsters - vampires & werewolves - together are so limited.  I liked the gothic setting and ultra-cool visceral action sequences.  However, the werewolf design certainly isn't the most realistic, being more cat-like than lupine / canine-like (the werewolf in Van Helsing is still the best-looking, although it was entirely a CGI creation).  William, the original lycan ancestor, remains the best & most realistic-looking werewolf in the entire series.

Nevertheless, the video and audio quality in blu-ray is top-notch.  The series' signature bluish tinge and dark setting serves as a solid test of any HD TV's black levels. Visuals are sharp and highly detailed, especially important for night and underground settings.  The audio, in uncompressed PCM format, is pure listening bliss. Gunfire and action sequences explode with full aural clarity.  The subwoofer reproduces bass levels accurately.  I was a bit disappointed that Rise of the Lycans was encoded in Dolby TrueHD instead of uncompressed PCM, but the movie audio was still acceptable.

My favourite of the series remains Evolution, because it brought the series' main protagonists (Selene & Michael) head-to-head with their toughest antagonists (the original vampire & lycan ancestors).  We also get to meet the 'founding father' Alexander Corvinus and feed on some background story details in the opening film prologue.

I highly recommend this blu-ray boxset as a collectible for HD movie buffs, and can't wait for the blu-ray release of Awakening to complete my Underworld collection.",1328140800,2,1643,5.454545454545454

These are all great movies and worth getting five stars regardless of the digital copy. I mainly wanted to write this review because I know some people are expecting movie tickets within the box or on the packaging. This may be true if you buy somewhere else like Best Buy, but my tickets were sent to my email by Amazon the day after I ordered the collection. I am so thankful a previous person already stated this in their review because I was expecting the tickets as a code on the box, after reading the reviews, I went to my email and found it in my deleted folder because I accidentally deleted it a couple days ago. I retrieved them and got the code to print two tickets to see the new underworld movie.

I can watch the movies anywhere i go. My copy didn't come with the 2 free tickets to see underworld awakening, however amazon sent me a email with a code before I received my package with codes for the free tickets.

I picked up mine at Best Buy and its a greatly packaged set including the anime shorts that are not part of the original HD trilogy box set. I got my 2 free tickets to Underworld: Awakening and redeemed the tickets last night (value of $20). So basically I get to see the new movie for free and get the original trilogy for less than $15. Sounds like a great value to me. Plus the fact that Im a huge fan of this franchise and of supernatural fiction in general.
Sound quality: exceptional HD sound. Video quality: inky blacks, detailed close-ups (you can see pores), absolutely great HD video definition. Extras: would have preferred more, but those provided add depth to the making of the film, particularly the stunts scenes.",1325808000,,814,4.582191780821918
3823003,1,B001VLFE76,"This is a review concerning the Ultraviolet copies that you receive with the trilogy. The movies themselves are great! Five stars all the way.
 If you're expecting to buy this package because it comes with the 'digital copy' of the movie then think again. After creating a new account with Sony and Flixster (two  more username and passwords to remember) I redeemed the code provided and then tried to download my copies to my computer. Unlike iTunes, when you have the movies in your Flixster collection unless you download them to an IOS device you need the internet to 'stream' the movies with the Flixster app on your iPad or iPhone..etc Another flaw that Ultraviolet has when you want to hurry up and watch your movies on the go.
 Now when I try to watch them all I get it a lovely Error message. I have contacted the company which provides the codes to redeem and all I got was that it must have been something that I done while downloading or maybe my 'new' computer just isn't good enough to play their movies. How about this Sony...maybe there is something wrong with your Ultraviolet copies!
 So if you are buying this for the movies then I give two thumbs up but if you want the digital copy too then I suggest downloading them from iTunes where movies will actually work when you press the play button!",1325462400,6,1314,4.531645569620253
3823004,3,B001VLFE76,"Underworld is an absolutely fantastic movie.  It may have merely been labeled as Hollywood popcorn fun, but there was some real layering to the film that many people have overlooked, especially in the film's extended cut.  Underworld Evolution has unfortunately gone the opposite route - Ditching plot and character development for action and gore.  Rise of the Lycans?  Good for what it is - A prequel that fills us in on the story that we really only got a glimpse at in the first two films... but it's nothing special.

But, for the cheap price, this is a great set.  3 movies, a very sleek looking box, and even a fourth disc including anime shorts.  The only real complaint?  This disc with the anime shorts has been hapharzadly thrown in as an afterthought as it's only included in a paper sleeve.  Why no keepcase?

Other than that, all three films look GREAT on Blu-ray, and people looking for a reason to upgrade from DVD, or those who don't own these films already, should have no qualms in biting the bullet here.",1325203200,2,1024,4.607734806629834

This is thier version of iTunes. Yes, that means ANOTHER media player, ANOTHER user name and pass to keep up with, and NO native iOS support. Sure you can get the Flixter app and then watch it, but why do that when most of us use iTunes daily for the same function.

Now there are many claims on the net about UV giving out redemption codes for iTunes for thier titles, well that isn't the case anymore. Sony wants to compete with Apple, regardless of how many customers are lost. I for one, will pass on any blue ray with the UV (maybe even Sony too) logo on it and I would recommend you readers do the same.",1325116800,,781,4.206666666666667

The movies themselves are pitch-perfect!  If you already own the individual movies on blu-ray, then you wouldn't really need this.  Even so, it's still a decent deal...around $25 for $20 in movie cash plus the unreleased anime episodes of Underworld (haven't watched them yet, but it looks fascinating.

It doesn't come with tickets but they never said it did, it was that one reviewer who did. Articles online also said it was going to come with tickets but after that not much was heard about it and a lot of places didn't have it listed so im guessing its because they had to pull the tickets or they would lose money. Two tickets would be at least $14 in the theater, and your already getting 3 movies in bluray and a digital copy for each for only $35. Six copies for $35, there should be no reason you should feel ripped off.

I made a decision to re-buy the movies on blu-ray cuz i had the dvd trilogy that i watched so many times to the point of the dvds getting worn out.  1 of the things that contributed to the dvds getting worn out was that the dvd trilogy i had had the disks stacked 1 on top of the other by 1 hook-clip, which is something i really don't appreciate when it comes to my collections. The blu-ray collection I'm talking about comes with the 3 movies in their individual cases in a slipbox(YAY!), and Kate Beckinsale on blu-ray? I can't tell you how much I had the hots for her from the first time I watched Underworld 1, and how excited I am that she's coming back for Underworld Awakening. Underworld 3 was a bit of a set-back cuz of Kate not being in this one, but you see more as to why Lucian had his vendetta against Viktor to begin with in Underworld 1.

Matt Skiba.
The fourth disc contains the complete three-part animated series ""Underworld Endless War"", which contains the franchise' main characters in stories that flesh out the centuries old struggle between vampire and werewolf.

This set also comes with Ultra-Violet digital copies for each film, but seeing as how most people have had a rather disagreeable time with this brand I wouldn't count it as a plus. I personally don't care about digital copies one way or another, so to me this set is great!

The collection will also contain two movie tickets to see the fourth installment, ""Underworld Awakening"", in theaters this January. I'm greatly anticipating this movie as well! I think this is a collection worth getting if you're a fan of the series, and if you haven't seen the films before but like dark fantasy, this set won't let you down!

3823027,4,B001VLFE76,"My review is simply based on the quality of the blu-ray conversion and the content, not about the movie itself.

Anyway, I find that the blu-ray version is decent enough... but not anything surprisingly good from what I've seen in other movies. There are some scenes where the 'grainy' spots have not been converted very well, so that was a bummer. This is highly evident in the first movie. As you progress through the 3rd movie, the blu-ray quality begins to stand out. But, since the tone of all 3 movies is relatively dark (they are vampires after all), you may not notice the imperfections very much. The features themselves are decent as well (deleted scenes, outtakes, commentary, etc); though, I can't recall what type of features were originally available in the DVD counterparts. This is still a good set to purchase if you're a fan.

Overall I would say this is a good collection to buy if you haven't yet added the Underworld series. I have enjoyed this kind of interpretation about vampires and werewolves over most of the other related movies that I've seen. Keep in mind that this is a simple action movie based on vampires and werewolves, and the war between them... so the plot isn't something to make you ponder the mysteries of life. Other than that, I just enjoy Kate Beckinsale in tight leather.  =P",1314576000,2,1320,4.705627705627705

I will need to add that, for the blu-ray trilogy version the languages and subs are different for each movie.. so be careful if this matters to you..

For Underworld, AUDIO: ENGLISH, FRENCH AND ITALIAN, same as subs, Underworld:Evolution, AUDIO:ENGLISH AND FRENCH, SUBS:ENGLISH, FRENCH, CHINESE, PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH, and for Rise of the Lycans, AUDIO: ENGLISH, FRENCH, PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH, same as subs.",1310083200,2,565,5.482758620689655

Now that I've just finished watching the movie, I have a few words to share with fellow customers:

As for the movie itself, I think it is one of, if not, the best Vampires movie. A well-put together mosaic of cinematic artistry where acting, special effects & story telling techniques complement each other in an inseparable state of awesomeness! Part I left me puzzled with questions, whereas Part II left me breathless & desiring for more. Hence comes Part III which left me mesmerized on my couch. I almost thought I turned into a Lycan! A-Whooooooooo! Thankfully, my neighbors didn't suspect anything!!

As for the Blue Ray Discs, they deliver on quality in every aspect starting with the packaging (Very neat) through image & sound quality. The first disc is rated R. It comes loaded with prolong yet interesting documentary about the origins and/or traces of the ever-mystical Vampires & Werewolves in both history & science [Fang vs. Fiction]. The second disc is UNRATED (sure is a plus) [Parental advisory for sexual content] along with more added features about the making of the movie. The 3rd disc is rated R & comes bundled with a Digital Copy, sweet!

Now,whether I'm talking about the Blue Ray Discs or the artistic creations loaded onto them, I am sure to recommend them to a friend with projecting confidence. It sure is a must add-on to your home movie collection.",1302739200,2,1660,4.73356401384083

You really don't get the whole effect of the story until you've seen all the movies back-to-back.  Completely fascinating!  I'm not a big werewolf fan, but in this series, I have come to be one.  The dichotomy between the vampire clans trying desperately to hold on to their traditions and the fight of the Lycans to gain and maintain their freedom is classic.  The fight scenes are heart-poundingly filmed and keep you on the edge of your seat, while the story itself unfolds in a manner that makes you feel you are part of the story.  It is not so much watching the plot unfold as it is experiencing it.  Excellent series and a must-see for any vampire, werewolf, sci-fi/fantasy, or action fan.",1302652800,,847,4.556291390728477

I don't think I have ever seen so much grain in a movie. It was more than distracting. It was more than irritating. I have no words to describe it.
I fiddled with the color, contrast, brightness, filtering, etc on the TV & player for the better part of an hour whilst stopping the movie numerous times to replay earlier scenes to check the effectiveness of my new settings.
On the bright side, the new settings looked fantastic on some of my better looking movies. So, if nothing else, at least it forced me to tweak some things.
In the end, I made it bearable for those with really bad eyesight.
Ultimately, Rise of the Lycans pretty much looks like it was downloaded from the internet or something.
Rise of the Lycans, on it's own, gets 2 stars from me.

Both Underworld & Underworld Evolution look fine. No complaints there. I would give each of those 4 stars.",1300406400,18,951,4.342696629213483

I owned the first two on DVD but I'm really not a video- or audio-phile, so I can't really tell you what percentage better the picture or sound quality is.  All three movies looked beautiful, though, and if you already own the movies on DVD, I'd say it's worth the upgrade.  I got these as part of Amazon's weekly blu-ray deal-of-the-week, but they'd have been a welcome part of my collection at full price.

I'm still not sure which movie I like best.  I was a bit put off by ""Rise of the Lycans"" becuase of it's notable lack of Kate Beckinsale, but I do like it a lot.

3823048,4,B001VLFE76,"This if for the blu-ray trilogy. I would give this set 3.5 stars, but my phone's only letting me do whole stars...

I've come to appreciate these films more over time; especially after seeing previews of Twilight. The art direction & costumes are superb. The story in the 3rd film, Rise of the Lycans, is by far my favorite, even without Kate Beckinsale; it feels complete, important & epic. Bill Nighy does a great job, and I'm to the point where I'm not as bothered by Michael Sheen's bulging-eye business. All of the films do a good job setting up and executing the action sequences. Even if they are a bit predictable, it's fun to watch it play out, and to wait for the other shoe to drop (or half a head).

Rise of the Lycans is also the best looking of the 3 on blu-ray; the costumes are the most ornate of the series, and I'm guessing it was shot 100% digital; the other 2 movies are clear but not quite as sharp. All of the films have grain, either due to the low lighting, or intentional effect; doesn't bother me.

I actually exchanged this set, due to a significant hang-up in Lycan's interactive menu. The disc's laminant was too thin, and the digital etchings were exposed to open air (not ideal). As it turned out, the lamination was not the issue; my new disc looked like it was manufactured correctly, but still got hung up. I researched it online and found out I had to upgrade my blu-ray player's firmware. I have an older player - a Samsung BD-P1500. Once I updated the firmware, the hang-up was gone.

I'd recommend this series to anyone who likes Lord of the Rings, or blood-soaked historical epics in general.",1272067200,3,1631,4.4630872483221475

3823051,5,B001VLFE76,"Being an avid horror freak for nearly four decades now I wish to throw my two cents in...

I love them all! The classics (Dracula & Frankenstein) with such greats as Bela Lugosi and Boris Kaloff, the 80's slasher flicks ( A nightmare on Elm St; Friday the 13th, Halloween),  modern day throwbacks such as The devil's Rejects (which has become one of my all time favorites...Gotta love Rob Zombie!), Two thumbs up to certain remakes such as The Texas Chainsaw massacre & Halloween (Rob again!),By the way the TCM...The beginning, is another of my favorites, and last but not least the newer kidnap/torture genre such as (Saw, Hostel, Turistas).

That being said I have always held a certain special place for monsters, Vampires & Werewolves to be precise, in my heart.  Back in 1981 two legendary werewolf movies came out.  Of course I'm talking about The Howling directed by Joe Dante & Creature effects by Rob Bottin and An American Werewolf in London, Directed by John Landis and Special effects by Bottins mentor Rick Baker.  These two movies held the title for the best ever created until now...

The story plot & special effects make these movies, in my opinion, instant classics! A must watch for any horror/action fan.  The cast is awesome with Selene (Kate Beckinsale) as the definitive heroin, a kickass Vampire with a matrix (Trinity) feel to her, coupled with an excellent portrayal by Bill Nighly (Viktor)and rounded off by Lucian (Played by Micheal Sheen).

So if you love the traditional monsters with modern day high impact, non stop action and love being dazzled by 21st century special effects , then these movies are for you...A must watch!",1269129600,2,1658,4.851063829787234
3823052,3,B001VLFE76,"The Underworld Trilogy is at once great and average.  The first movie, Underworld, has become a bit of a classic for the genre, featuring an interesting premise, a decent plot, and a story that unwinds with purpose and method.  The sequel is a full-blown disaster, with convoluted plots, poor script, and a lacking sense of closure.  Finally, the prequel, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" corrects almost every mistake made in the second movie.  A focus on character development, real (not CGI) effects, and a story simple in scope and easy to relate to serve up a fitting end.

The Blu-ray video and audio quality is excellent.  The dark and somber coloration used by the director is clearly evident in the picture and is far superior to the DVD, which I also have.  There is an excellent surround mix and the dialog sounds perfectly placed.

3823076,4,B001VLFE76,"If you're a horror fan and not heard of the UNDERWORLD series you're missing out. While some sites online have criticized the series, it has truly offered a new spin on the legends of vampires and werewolves and one that I have enjoyed more than the recent TWILIGHT. Not that that film doesn't have its place, but this one offers more action and less seduction.

Now fans can rejoice with the release of the entire trilogy on blu-ray discs. Not only do you get the entire story from start to current finish (a film franchise has more lives than a reborn monster), but you can watch them in glorious sharp color and image. The first two films told the story of the battle between the two monster clans in present day settings and were filled with some impressive images to watch. The latest takes us back to where it all began.

UNDERWORLD opens with a lone heroine poised on a ledge watching for something, for someone. When she sees those she seeks, she leaps off to what one would surmise is her death only to spring gracefully back up to a standing position and walk away. The viewer is now aware that this is no normal person.

No, this is Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and she is a vampire enforcer of types, searching for a special person. But at the same time a group of werewolves (we learn shortly after) are stalking this same person, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). A battle in a subway station leaves losses on both sides and the discovery of a nest of werewolves found.

As the film progresses, we discover alliances made, political motivations between both vampires and werewolves and just why it is that Michael Corvin is so special. How he plays into events set forth in the past makes for not only an action filled film but one with plenty of plot as well, nicely wrapped around a romance so that all viewers leave pleased.

UNDERWORLDl EVOLUTION continues the story of Michael and Selene as they go into hiding having betrayed both worlds once Selene discovered her own leader had struck a deal with the lycan (werewolf) leader. In an attempt to revive the last living elder vampire, wheels are set in motion that will change the history of both creatures.

Rather than try and move forward with a story that had seemed to find it's end already, UNDERWORLDl RISE OF THE LYCANS heads to the past, explaining what set in motion the events of the previous two films. The most recent of the three, it brings back a few old cast members and (since she wasn't born yet) leaves Beckinsale out of the picture this time.

Viktor (Bill Nighy) is the head of the vampire clan, an elite ruling class that defends the local humans from being overrun by both man and beast. In return they merit tribute from the humans as well as obedience. This is a ruling class that controls with an iron fist. They have also enslaved the werewolves of yore, unable to revert back to human form and used to protect their lair/castle during day light hours.

Into this system is born Lucien (Michael Sheen) or a werewolf mother. Viktor takes pity on the newborn and raises him as close to his own as one can a slave. Lucien in return assists in the defense of the vampires, killing his own kind in the process.

But Lucien also harbors a secret not even Viktor is aware of. Lucien has been having an affair with Viktor's willful daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). The two meet in secret and Lucien reveals his plans to escape and leave the castle, wanting Sonja to leave with him.

When the wild werewolves of the forest attack a caravan of humans on their way to the castle, Lucien reveals his ability to escape his shackles when he comes to the aid of Sonja who rode forth to battle the werewolves. Turning into a ferocious animal, Lucien seems to control these wild wolves. And even though he saved Sonja's life, he is punished by Viktor for disobeying him as well as removing his chains.

Filled with rage, Lucien escapes along with the rest of the captive werewolves yet to turn and a handful of slaves recently captured. Sonja doesn't make it out and Lucien vows to save her. Charged with treason, Sonja is set to die and a trap is established to capture Lucien. Will he succumb or will he find a way to reunite with Sonja and free all the slaves?

The film has some epic battles, though small in numbers involved, but enough so that they are brutal, bloody and vicious, everything one would expect in a vampire/werewolf fight. The end fight between a marauding army of werewolves and the vampires in their castle is an amazing piece of CGI magic that will please most and disappoint the fanatical anti-CGI crowd. To me, it was a thrill to watch.

The acting in this film is high quality and reaches the bench mark of what good acting means. You forget and set aside the fact you are watching actors perform and fall into the world they are portraying. You feel as if they actually ARE those characters. Among them Nighy has established the role of Viktor throughout the series as his own and shows a range here of violence and disappointment one rarely sees. Sheen does a great job as Lucien especially since his character here is younger than in both previous films. Mitra? She does the unenviable job of taking over where Kate Beckinsale was as a central character and yet holds her own.

The nice thing about this film is that ties into the previous films and establishes what went down prior to the events in them. And it ends with just a touch of the first film to link them all. Fans won't be disappointed. Those who have never seen the films are offered a good place to start from. And if you love them all you now have the option of all three together in blu-ray.

3823077,3,B001VLFE76,"The 3 DVDs are stacked one on top of another and held by a single clip.  I doubt it would have cost more than a cent or two to insert a plastic DVD separator page.  The current packaging causes the DVDs to be easily scratched upon eachother during removal and replacement to the clip.  The movies are great, but the packaging is cheaply done.",1242518400,80,342,4.3125
