7889908,3,6305474656,"Let me start by saying that I didn't read the book, so my opinion is based solely on the movie. What drew me to it is Masterpiece Theater's reputation and my love of Cornwall. I didn't think the movie did either justice. It was just barely okay. I almost turned it off and my husband only stood it for about 30 minutes. The plot was unbelievable. It plays like a modern fantasy romance rather than a period piece. No self-respecting woman would behave the way that this woman does with the smoking, drinking in a public house, and running around half naked in front of people. The ""romance"" was not very romantic. There is no courtship or falling in love. It's just a kiss and then we are supposed to believe that they love each other. If that were me, all the killing would cool any sense of romance right away. The scenery doesn't capture the beauty or essence of Cornwall. It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, but I won't be watching it again.",1338595200,,946,4.411428571428571
7889909,4,6305474656,"This movie is excellent: I bought the Masterpiece Theatre VHS version a few years ago: it is a very entertaining re-make of the Joan Fontaine ""Frenchman's Creek,"" of 1944 based on Daphne DuMaurier's book of the same name.

When Lady Dona St Columb tires of her ""scandalous"" & somewhat debauchered lifestyle in London, she decides to retreate to the sanctity of her country estate in Cornwall. Here she encounters a mysterious & dashing French pirate. Now she must decide whether to follow her heart that yearns for adventure & the love of a dashing pirate or her head, which is telling her to follow her Catholic morals & stay with her (foolish) husband. This story briefly touches on the struggle of the time between Catholics & Protestants in England. Be ready to encounter adventure, love, drama, ships, pirates, etc.!!!

For those of you worried about content, be aware that there is a violent scene of fighting & an attempted rape towards the end: there is also a love scene that lasts a few seconds or so, earlier in the film. The lead character is struggling with morality & her faith, versus the excitement of adventure & forbidden love, so her choices are not always moral, although there does seem to be a balance in the end.

All in all, this movie is a well-done, entertaining & romantic swashbuckler of a film! If you can get past the content, I would recommend this: if you are looking for a cleaner version of the same great story, check out the 1944 VHS version with Joan Fontaine!!",1147046400,10,1498,4.666666666666667
7889910,5,6305474656,"I have always loved Daphne DuMaurier's story and remembered the beauty of the original film's art direction which won an Oscar. However, I could never get through the book and found Joan Fontaine's arched acting a little hard to take. So, when I discovered this Masterpiece Theatre version, I ordered it immediately and have grown to really admire the writing which places the romantic story into its historical period and fashions Dona St. Colombe and her pirate captain into real in-depth, flesh and blood characters. Bravo to Masterpiece Theatre.",1132012800,6,549,5.179775280898877
7889911,4,6305474656,"Tara Fitzgerald makes a lovely Dona and Anthony Delon portrays the Frenchman pirate of the title, Jean Aubery, to perfection.  In fact all the players were selected admirably: Rockingham is disturbingly sly and manipulative, William combines the right combination of sex appeal with devoted servitude and Harry exudes vulnerability and inner strength as Dona's husband.  Just like Du Maurier intended them to be, fleshed out from the pages of her novel and set on the lonely wild coast of Cornwall.

My main objection to this film, if it can be called an objection, is that it fails to tell the story of the novel.  Yes, the characters are not changed and the local is the same.  What differs is the setting--this story is driven by the religious revolution of 1688--Catholic King James has fled to France as Protestant William of Orange marches in from the Netherlands.  Lady Dona is a Catholic fleeing the eventual destruction of the court of which she is alligned.  France has declared war on England at this crucial time and so the pirate is, in a sense doing his duty, rather than ravaging the English coast simply for his own amusement as he does in the novel.  Navaronne, Lady Dona's estate is not the idyllic refuge of the book, it too has transformed into a battle ground where corpses litter the roads patrolled by befeathered Orangeman troops.

There are far too many differences in this film version to comment on individually, so instead I will say that it simply does not faithfully adhere to the story told in the novel.  The adventure and romance remains, but even this is twisted to appeal to a more modern day audience. Most disturbing was the addition of tension between Dona and her young daughter which unfortunately weaves its way into the dinner scene at the film's climax.  The producers most likely and sadly felt that the notion of a woman wanting to escape the life she thought at one time satisfying not meaningful enough for audiences who expect the Lifetime Channel's grander causes.  There is none of the frivolity that makes Du Maurier's work a delightful escape albeit with a philosophical tone.

Despite its plot differences, the film still entertains.  Lady Dona remains a free spirit encumbered by her station in life.  As much as I enjoyed Anthony Devon's Jean,I would have liked to have seen what he would have brought to the man-without-a-cause depicted in the book.  Whether this is how Du Maurier intended Frenchman's Creek to flow, the film provides an enjoyable two hours of entertainment.",1045353600,38,2532,4.8671328671328675
7889912,3,6305474656,"It's not bad, exactly.  Despite occasional departures from the story it follows most of the essential points.  But, like so many other adaptations of Du Maurier novels, it fails to realize that while her atmospheres are gothic, they are not depressing.  Much of Frenchman's Creek on paper is sunny and joyous, not bleak.  The conematography here makes it look like it is perpetually overcast, and it shouldn't.  The same applies to the characterizations.  Anthony Delon is mysterious, but not warm and normal and human as he should be, Dona is missing her sense of fun.  It's all a little dreary after a while.",1018310400,15,610,4.864077669902913
7889913,3,6305474656,"His reaction surprised me because he tends to be a bit leery of historical-romance based material.  However, I really think he liked the pirate, the pirate ship, the coast of Cornwall, the war, the smuggling and  that kind of thing.  I liked the pirate too.  He's the 36 year old son of  French actor Alain Delon so it was hard to go wrong with him as a French  pirate. However, the story itself really didn't work well for me, in part  because the ending was changed from the book's ending. However, it was an  evening's entertainment and no expense had been spared in bringing this  authentically to the screen.  My husband would probably give it 4 stars and  he liked the woman too.  So if you want to watch a historical romance on  your video/dvd system that won't send your husband scurrying out of the  room, this one is it.

7889914,1,6305474656,"I'd been waiting a long time for a remake of the story. I was never pleased with the Joan Fontaine movie, but now I'm beginning to think it has merit. This new production deviates so much from the book that it's  unbelievable! I've read the book more than once and was outraged with what  they've done with it. Tara Fitzgerald is not at all like Dona St. Columb  and looked more like a kitchen wench than a lady. Both she and the  Frenchman could have used better hair styles. Daphne DuMaurier would be  appalled if she could see the ""liberties"" taken with her book. I  just watched about 20 minutes at the beginning and then the ending just to  see what they did with it. Changed it too. This has to be one of the worst  interpretations of a book I've ever seen.",946944000,4,763,4.286713286713287
