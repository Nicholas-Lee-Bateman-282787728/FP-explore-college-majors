8502523,5,B006P180EG,"Whilst there's nothing new in the plot of this 2010 made for TV movie, that you haven't seen in countless movies over the past couple of decades, Wild Things would be my pick of the best of these high school girl becomes obsessed with her teacher and will do whatever it takes to get him.  The Perfect Teacher though is a top contender too, being the teacher (David Charvet, Melrose Place and Baywatch in his younger days) and the teen predator played by a much older than that but still  passable as a teen Megan Park do a very good job in their respective roles.  You can have fun with this one too, such as the teacher shaves, where his daughter begs him to stay home, then the next minute has his three day growth back. Also the fact the girl and her father seem to live in a cement walled industrial area office building, which is kind of weird when at one point its mentioned he's incredibly wealthy so should be able to afford a house. Maybe a drug habit we don't see in the film. The support cast doesn't do a bad acting job either which is rare in the made for TV genre.

Devon (the teen character) is a truly great film psychopath, although she does make some stupid decisions towards the end of the film.  Of course the teacher isn't immune to stupid decisions and not thinking about consequences, putting himself into situations that can come back to bite him either.",1446336000,,1379,4.392156862745098

8502525,1,B006P180EG,"It could not be opened on the DVD player of the person it was a gift for giving a message of ""Playback by Area Limitations"".  The Seller said it was clearly marked Region 2 which I found out later from someone who buys a lot of DVD's that this would indicate it was in a different language.  I didn't realize it was in French when I bought it or I wouldn't have purchased it.  The person I purchased it for had viewed it in English and wanted to have the movie.  Obviously I can't use it since no one I know speaks or understands French.  The seller says it was clearly indicated that it was in French.  I'm not happy with the purchase for these reasons.  The $41 plus shipping won't create a financial disaster so I'll dispose of the product and never order another DVD other than from a local retailer.",1386374400,2,804,4.25
8502526,3,B006P180EG,"Devon Burke (Megan Park) is a beautiful 17-year-old blonde high-school student who is used to controlling people, including her best friend Kinsey (Amanda Tilson), to get her own way. She takes a shine to her new maths teacher, Jim Wilkes (David Charvet), and decides that she wants him, whatever the cost. Wilkes is separated from his wife who is intent upon moving across country to a new job. She intends to take their daughter Annique (Keeva Lynk), who now lives with her father, with her. Wilkes' girlfriend Rachel (Boti Bliss) is another teacher at the school and has a sick mother she takes care of, so if Wilkes relocates, she will not be able to go with him. So this is his conundrum - to stay with Rachel and lose meaningful contact with his daughter or move to be near his wife and daughter but lose Rachel. Devon gets herself appointed as assistant to Wilkes as he coaches the volleyball team. She runs down Wilkes' wife with her car, she accuses him of rape, kidnaps his daughter - and generally stalks him and makes his life unbearable. The plot is thin but Megan Park is convincingly bad as Devon.",1358208000,,1112,4.592964824120603
