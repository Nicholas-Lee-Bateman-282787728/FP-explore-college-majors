8351445,1,B0025XUTBU,"If you have been a fan of U2, music, or any group...skip this film.  There are so many reasons.  My main gripe...it is not well researched; instead, it has simply nabbed headlines, mainly about Bono.  I could not finish it.  It is that bad.  This was not a film about U2...although they were mentioned.",1393718400,9,302,4.518518518518518
8351446,4,B0025XUTBU,A fantastic band that I have been following since the 80s and worked for in the late 80s. I simply enjoy their music and look foward to more excellent music.,1389312000,,157,4.266666666666667
