2244413,4,B0007U5V7U,"David Cronenberg's film ""Naked Lunch"" (1991) is based on William S. Burrough's surrealistic novel of the same name from 1959. This film is Cronenberg's synthesis of the writings and life of Burroughs, as well as the actual writing of the novel the ""Naked Lunch"" in Tangier. The movie starts off with William Lee (Peter Weller) standing in as the Burrough's character who makes his living as an insect exterminator. This first segment is based on Burrough's work the ""Exterminator!"". Early on Burrough's actually made his living as an insect exterminator. The collection of stories entitled ""Interzone"" also formed the basis for aspects of the film. The movie also has characters such as Hank (Nicholas Campbell) and Martin (Michael Zelniker) who loosely represent friends of Burroughs, such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg (who helped Burroughs compile his novel ""Naked Lunch""). Joan Lee (Judy Davis) portrays Burrough's drug abusing wife whom he accidentally shot in real life. This film weaves the real with the surreal as we follow the junkie William Lee through the dark corridors of his mind.

This DVD comes with an exceptional audio commentary by David Cronenberg. It is filmed in English with subtitles in French with a 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack, and in widescreen, with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 at 115 minutes.",1263686400,,1326,5.138888888888889

The plot centers around  a William Burroughs-esque character on a mission from the powers that be from the Interzone Corporation--a drug induced world inhabited by plenty of insects, drug addicts and sexual deviants (and any combination thereof).  A showcase for some awesome insects created by human hands... a lost art in todays digital film world and the slightly meandering, slightly nonsensical plot fits right in with the tone of the movie (and the book, I imagine).

Aside from all that, the Naked Lunch movie, on it's own, is pretty impressive. You have to see this movie at least once in your life.",1047945600,,576,4.495238095238095

It's about a bug exterminator who gets addicted to the roach poison. He starts to hallucinate and what he sees is so gut-wrenchingly nauseating, it makes you pale: giant roaches that speak from fleshy holes in their abdomens, an alien with fleshy tubes that oozes addictive milky substances into a cup, typewriters that turn into bugs and other assorted ""lunch."" All these critters have one purpose: to persaude the author that his wife is actually a secret agent and must be killed. This he does in a ""William Tell"" fashion, aiming at a glass pitched on top of her head. He misses and she goes down. Bye bye Joanie. I like Burroughs' writing, especially Junky & Queer, but this is just too much. Technically very good, the movie has some truly sickening and potentially psyche-damaging scenes.

2244422,5,B0007U5V7U,"Talking slithering strangely sexual typewriters, addicts of cockroach-exterminating pyretheum powder (who like to breath on cbugs and watch them die while on it), thick-fluid sipping mugwhump creatures, an assortment of strange parasitic characters to represent the sinister parts of you you never knew ere there, and a high as a kite protagonist to narrate it all. What more can I say? This is both a brilliant representation of William S. Burrough's no-holds-barred dark imagination and director Cronenburg's as well, both with the twisted audascity to take all these horrific atroscities of reality and fantasy and breath eroticism & mystery into them...
Impossible to describe or even explain (almost but not quite as incomprehensible as FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS), the movie is not exactly a telling of the book Naked Lunch (even though some characters, namely the vile mugwhumps, show up) as it is a telling of Burroughs writing the book and what he may have imagined while writing it.
THe film starts out with the main character William Lee and his even more ""creepy"" (if anyone in the Burroughs line ever wanted to label what's inside themselves) wife, Joan, are addicted to the roach powder pyretheum, which Lee obtains thru his job as an exterminator. After playing a drunken William Tell act with his wife and blowing her head off so to say (which actually happened to Burroughs and his wife, and is said to have sparked the writing of Naked Lunch), he escapes to Tangiers, Mexico (with a ""ticket"" which actually appears to be a syringe). There he flows into a seemingly hallucinatory Interzone--a place populated by all the things mentioned above and tons more weirdness. He also meets the wife of a bisexual author who looks almost identical to his wife...and they engage in a particularly freaky sexual practice in which a typewriter tries to join in. If I say any more, the plot will be totally given away, so just watch, and compared to all the elaborate twists and turns on this unreal path to hell, I've said very little.
Great performances from Roy Sheider (who plays Dr. Benway, another character direct from the book), Paul Weller as Lee, Judy Davis as Joan and the other Joan, and Robert A. Silverman as a truly unique black centipede meat salesman with a disquieting manor (the black centipede meat, as well as Burroughs' thoughts on how centipedes controlled many Interzone lives, were from the novel).

No, this adaptation will not please everyone because it may take a few viewings to connect the dots but that's all the more reason to see it twice or three times.  It's very atmospheric of the '50s Beat Gen with Ornette Coleman blowing a special sound track sax, excellent vignettes of Burroughs' book and real life intertwined and those CREATURES!  It's great to watch with a buzz on too.  But enough of the fun...this is entertaining CINEMA, NOT A BOOK!",997833600,,916,4.548780487804878
2244424,5,B0007U5V7U,"What can I say about this film? ""Serious"" Burroughs  fans tend to exercise their credentials by panning it,  more often than not, while serious fans of Mr.  Cronenberg's work are totally rewarded for their  willingness to follow him on his seamless  hallucinogenic visions.
  So who is right? The film fans, of course. Naked  Lunch, the ""novel,"" is not filmable in any sense of the  word. There is no way any screen adaptation could  ever meet the work's fans expectations or private  interpretations. So the film should be judged on its  own merits, as an audio-visual presentation (much  as Apocalypse Now! is not to be narrowly  considered as an adaptation of Conrad's Heart of  Darkness). As a work standing on its own is how this  picture truly shines, of course.
 As the beautiful 1950's period-piece titles float over Ornette Coleman's wonderful score, you know you are in for a treat. Like Sting's chuckle at the beginning of ""Roxanne,"" it is an effortless expression that this one is going to be great, so relax.
 The characters are wonderfully stylised icons of 50's artistic bohemian life. Struggling to get by, pursuing their writing and their personal proclivities without concern for mass acceptance (or even legality), trying to cope on the fly with the chaos bred by the passions that unravel and disorganise their lives, they each exude at their core a powerful need to be themselves.
 We hop on this ride as ""flies on the wall"" (sorry, I really could not help that!) observing one William Lee (Peter Weller), at a point where he has fooled himself into thinking that he is leading a nice, normal life. He has a wife, Joan (Judy Davis), and a steady job catering to New York City's happiest inhabitants, the ever-present insect population. But nothing stays simple for Lee for long. He follows Joan in her development of a taste for the intravenous consumption of his bug powder, until the supply dries up. In his attempts to figure out a way to ""kick,"" or at least survive withdrawal painlessly, a mysterious Dr. Benway provides him with a substitute that will make him ""lose his taste for the bug powder all together.""
 At this point more chaos enters his life in the form of his accidental shooting of his wife. On the run from the law for drug use and probably murder, he travels far, far, away to a place we know as Interzone, which while styled as a ""notorious free port on the coast of North Africa,"" retains a remarkable similarity to the New York underbelly in which he already lives - to the point where his concerned friends (""just finish your book, Bill, then come back to us"") are only a bus ride away. He is quite obviously also on the run from himself, as well. His writings, his hallucinogenic ""reports"" on his trip, are what are to become his book, Naked Lunch, although he denies all knowledge of its creation (""nothing that a reasonably well organised cabal could not put together,"" probably misquoted at this point).
 Lee spends an indeterminate time in Interzone, wrestling with his drug use, which has moved on to the ""true black meat of the Brazilian aquatic centipede,"" his sexuality (""homosexuality is the best all around cover an agent can have""), and his writing - wrought highly visible in this incredible film by the series of typewriters with personalities, needs, and benefits all of their own.
 He ultimately seems to be on his way to escaping his Interzone, with the recently liberated Joan Frost (also played by Judy Davis), for the neighboring Ataxia (sp.?) but as he is being accosted at the border and asked to prove that he is a writer... the film loops in on itself and once more, he finds himself inexorably writing the same story. He can run and hide behind the fog of drugs, sexual escapism and outrageousness, and over the edge writing, but he cannot escape the realities of his life.
 In this film the attempt to live in one's own created reality is examined so realistically you almost forget that the lead character is hallucinating most of the time. The recreational pharmaceuticals, the sexual experimentation, and the drive to create are limned in an incredibly clear and valid way - as is their downside, the pitfalls inherent in experimenting on oneself against the narrow confines of ""conventional wisdom."" It is an excellent guidebook and companion piece to anyone struggling with issues such as these in their own life...",996883200,,4392,4.795755968169761
2244425,2,B0007U5V7U,"Although this film is not at all a direct adaption of Burrough's novel, I can't help but compare the two, only because i really enjoyed the novel but had trouble sitting through the film. I think that there are several elements in the book (and in Burrough's work in general) that are lacking in the film that can account for my dislike of ""Naked Lunch the movie"". First of all, the novel is written in what can be described as cartoon skits, albeit disturbing ""cartoons."" However, while the novel is cartoonish and in constant motion, the film moves slowly with humans and scenes that are, well, all-too-human (even William Lee's cockroach typewriter). Secondly, the book is funny. The film, on the other hand, lacked the outrageous comedy of the novel and the outrageous atmosphere in general; the novel gives the impression of a mad-romp into hell, the film is more like a burdened walk. Overall, i found this movie to be slow without sufficient elements to hold my attention. Unlike, for example, Bukowski's ""Barfly"", which is wonderfuly honest and brutal, ""Naked Lunch"" comes off as pressing the issue, as trying too hard, and ultimately fails to accomplish whatever it was trying too hard to do.",985478400,,1201,4.863414634146341
2244426,5,B0007U5V7U,"I loved this film when I first saw it. I am disappointed that it is not available on DVD. There are a number of decent reviews here.

2244428,5,B0007U5V7U,"David Cronenberg's dazzling sci-fi imagery meets William S. Burroughs' dark humor in this bizarre cult film. Peter Weller plays William Lee, an exterminator who can't seem to keep track of his bug powder. His writer friends hint that it may be a `domestic problem.' Indeed, he finds that his wife is stealing his bug powder for its narcotic effects.
 At a party with two friends (meant to be Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg), Lee nods to his wife and says, `About time for our William Tell act...' Joan balances her highball glass on her head and closes her eyes. Bill isn't such a good shot that night, and accidentally shoots a hole through Joan's forehead. The glass falls to the floor, intact.
 Soon the police are after Lee. They lock him in a room with a giant bug, who tells him his real identity. It starts him on his journey to Interzone, a strange hallucinatory world inhabited by talking insects, living typewriters, and alien/insect mugwumps that secrete intoxicating juices from the penises on their heads.
 Lee has a long strange trip in Interzone. His insect typewriter sends him on missions where he meets strange people and even stranger creatures. And all the while he is still on the run from the police.
 David Cronenberg's screenwriting and directing skills were in top form for this movie. Once called `the king of venereal horror,' his trademark grotesque sexual imagery and bug obsessions, as seen in Videodrome and The Fly, have  been honed to give the perfect nightmarish effect. Surely there couldn't be a better man to bring Burroughs' Interzone to the big-screen.
 The acting was also superb.  Wearing a fedora and an anonymous tan overcoat, and speaking in Burroughs' low monotonous drawl, Weller is a very believable William Lee. Judy Davis was also excellent, bringing to life the most three-dimensional portrayal of Joan Vollmer Burroughs ever.
 The fabulously surreal special effects are sure to draw in Cronenberg fans, and fans of Burroughs will be equally entertained by samplings of the original book's `routines' and parallels to Burroughs' own life. However, Cronenberg isn't known for making accessible movies, and when coupled with Burroughs' characters, this certainly isn't a film for everyone. Rated `R' for heavy drug content, adult language, and `bizarre eroticism,' there are scenes portraying bug powder injection (a heroin metaphor), typewriters with genitalia, and  a gay sex scene in which Julian Sands turns into a parrot. But for all the ""adult"" content, this is a very intelligent, complex, and inspired movie that its viewers will not soon forget.",975801600,,2603,5.07728337236534

2244430,4,B0007U5V7U,"It is better to view this movie as a Cronenberg movie instead of as an adaptation of Burroughs' book because it is NOT what Big Bill wrote.  This movie is very Romantic...and I don't mean like lovers...I mean as in it is  about the Artist who must Suffer for His Work.  Although some would not  think so, the plot is more or less linear and easily-followed, coming off  like a James Bond movie with a need for a fix..a spy movie lived out  through a drug addict's hallucinogenic world.  Unfortunately, the majority  of the strange images in this movie are reduced to the aforementioned  drug-induced visions.  What Burroughs wrote was a very un-Romantic novel,  in fact it wasn't even really a novel.  It was just a string of what he  called ""routines"" that could be read in any order.  Burroughs'  passages about Dr. Benway (the behavioral conditioning freak), the hanged  man's orgasm, and homosexual orgies were a lot more terrifying in the book  (Jack Keruoac helped type the manuscript, and he said it gave him  nightmares) because the images were displayed as REAL...here we know they  are just caused by withdrawals or new highs.  On its own, viewed as a  Cronenberg movie, it is terrific.  Just try not to think of NAKED LUNCH the  book while watching it.",955324800,,1263,4.692660550458716
2244431,5,B0007U5V7U,"Naked Lunch by William S. Burroughs is one of those stories you can't forget. The imagery in the film is unforgettable too. Cronenberg's directing is solid, Peter Weller's acting is solid. A strange and beautiful  and bizarre trip about William S. Burroughs coming to terms with his  homosexuality. A must have for any film collector.",953683200,,334,5.054545454545455
2244432,5,B0007U5V7U,"As a devout Burroughs fan, of course I was a little hesitant to view this movie initially. And having read the book ""Naked Lunch"" prior to watching the film, I was at a loss as to what I expected. Certainly there  was no way this book could translate into a movie...even ""The  Wall"" director Alan Parker would have been lost.
In essence,  Cronenberg didn't attempt to recreate the book verbatim. Instead he deftly  interwove Burroughs' life with some of the routines and rants from the  book. This movie is not for the fainthearted as it shows man-sized mugwumps  and talking typwriter/insects who are really operatives for a covert  attempt to penetrate Interzone, using a hapless writer, Bill Lee, as their  chief spy.
Definitive moments in Burroughs' life, such as his  relationship with Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac and the death of his wife  Joan at his own hand are featured in the movie. It also gives a surreal  biography to the birth of the writer in Burroughs as he attempts to write  his way out of the guilt of his wife's death and the drugs that numbed the  difficulties of his life.
Those who think that this movie had no real  plot or if they did think there was a plot that the plot wasn't linear,  then they can't be that big a fan of Burroughs. His life was not normal,  his fans are not normal, and his mode of thinking was, frankly, insane.  Cronenberg does a brilliant job getting inside the mind of the writer, the  genius, the man, William S. Burroughs. Take a trip into his mind, ladies  and gentlemen, and be changed forever.",953510400,,1553,4.561594202898551

2244434,4,B0007U5V7U,"David Cronenberg has done something very interesting in his film version of the book by William Burroughs.  Attempting to faithfully follow the book's plot would have been a hopeless enterprise (and an X-rated movie);  instead, Cronenberg wraps short sequences from the novel and intertwines  them with Burroughs' own life.  This is not only completely appropriate for  this unique author, but also conveys the tone and structure of the book.  In this respect, although the 'plot' of the book is not followed with  slavish respect, this is one of the most successful book-to-film  translations.
There are interesting (if brief) portraits of Allen  Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac (although in the movie Ginsberg is portrayed as  pursuing Burroughs, when in fact Burroughs was in love with Ginsberg).  The  film also shows the accident in which Burroughs shot his wife, and his  meeting with Paul Bowles in Tangiers.  In the plot of the movie, Bill Lee  is instructed by giant insects to infiltrate Tangiers and write 'reports'  which eventually become the text of _Naked Lunch_.  All of the events of  the movie are shown from Bill Lee's drug-altered perception, so that most  of the film's scenes have to 'translated' from the metaphorical to the  actual by the viewer.  In spite of other reports, the movie is quite  coherent and linear, detailing Bill Lee's emotional recovery from drugs and  the death of his wife as he becomes a writer. Perhaps 'recovery' is the  wrong word; what Lee learns is to use them as material for his  writing.
One warning: Cronenberg's decision to use elaborate special  effects to show Bill Lee's reality works brilliantly, but it can be quite  disgusting.  The movie is not for weak stomachs (which again fits both the  book's title and content exactly).",950745600,,1782,5.027491408934708
