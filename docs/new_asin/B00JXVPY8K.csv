6397158,4,B00JXVPY8K,"Unfortunately we don't have The Hallmark Channel on our TV so I have not heard of When Calls The Heart before this DVD.  After researching I see that this is an original series based on the bestselling books by Janette Oke.

When Calls The Heart, the series is about the story about Elizabeth Thatcher a young teacher who beginning a new chapter in her life in a 20th century coal mining town.

In this DVD When Calls The Heart The Dance a group of miners descend on the town and The Dance part of the title is Miss Thatcher and the other woman in town throwing a dance to welcome the miners. It appears that there was a mining accident that took the lives of the men of the town leaving many of the woman to count on each other for support.  It also appears that the town's lone law enforcer is a Canadian Monty named, Jack Thornton. He has an obvious crush on Miss Thatcher but so does one of the new miners. A suave miner with a penchant for poetry, Mr. Billy Hamilton takes a liking to Miss Thatcher and she is definitely interested in his debonair ways that she almost forgets she actually likes Mr. Thornton who is only worried about her safety with the unfamiliar Hamilton. While these two gentlemen try to win over Miss. Thatcher. The other woman are dealing with trying to get their lives back in order after the mining accident.

Some are dealing with children who miss their daddies and won't mommy to move on with a new miner, others are dealing with pregnancy and trying to pay for food now that their men are gone.

In the midst of all this newness and attempt to get life back in order after the accident, there have been robberies in town and Monty Jack Thornton must find out who is to blame.

What I loved about this was that the show was very family oriented. It reminded me of Little House on the Prairie without the child stars. My favorite character is played by ""Becky""Lori Loughlin who plays Abigail Stanton, a wife and mother whose husband was the foreman of the mine and was killed in the explosion.

Season 2 will begin shooting in August and I now wish I had the Hallmark Channel so I could catch up on Season 1 and watch Season 2.

If you love shows like Dr. Quinn, Little House on the Prairie, or just love the Hallmark Channel shows you will undoubtedly love this series.

I personally love the clothing and how everyone leaned on each other during these times. You needed your friends and neighbors to survive and you could count on them.",1405382400,2,2470,4.38512035010941
6397159,5,B00JXVPY8K,"I really enjoyed When Calls The Heart - The Dance. It is a Hallmark movie inspired by the best selling series by Janette Oke.
  This DVD doesnt go along with the book series. It tells a story of the Elizabeth from the book series niece Elizabeth.
  It is continuing from the first DVD when Elizabeth goes West to teach those that no one else wants to teach. In this DVD men from another town come and help run the coal mine and they have quite a few adventures. Not all of the adventures are good ones either.
  I really enjoyed the part when the widow Carla is close to having a baby and no one really knows how to help or deliver a baby, but it all comes together.
  Some things are getting stolen and some lives are changing. Some good and some bad in all situations. I know you will love this DVD The Dance. I highly recommend it.

6397160,5,B00JXVPY8K,"If you are looking for an incredible family series that is appropriate for the entire family, then look no further than Hallmark Channel's When Calls The Heart! Based on the novels from best-selling author Janette Oke and combining the writing talents of Michael Landon Jr., you get an amazing story of life on the frontier for school teacher Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) in the small mining town of Coal Valley. Even though viewers know the feelings between Miss Thatcher and Canadian Mounty, Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing) has been sparking since the very beginning both of them maintain their proper boundaries from one another.

In the DVD release of When Calls the Heart: The Dance, we know see the small town coming back to familiar routines and one of them being the Miner games, which is hosting by the entire town for the miners and their families. As the mine ramps back up to full operation since the mining explosion that killed most of them men and their sons in Coal Valley, a new load of miners arrives at the mine. We now see, Billy Hamilton, a charismatic and handsome miner take interest in Miss Thatcher and he isn't afraid to let her know his is interested, even quoting romantic poetry he claims as his own. Even though Elizabeth has reservations about his methods, she isn't about to wait on Jack forever to make his feelings known. But Jack warns Elizabeth not to be so trusting, without him investigation Billy Hamilton more fully. Elizabeth just thinks Jack is jealous.

Some of the other women in town seem to be interested in the miners as well. But when a string of robberies begin to hit the town, Jack feels that he knows who the criminal is and sets up a trap to capture Billy Hamilton in the act. He attempts to show Elizabeth that the information he has on Billy proves his is hiding something and if she doesn't watch out she may lose more than just her heart. So who is hiding the biggest secret of all in Coal Valley? Viewers of When Calls The Heart: The Dance, will have to pick this one up to find out!

I received When Calls the Heart: The Dance compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for an honest review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. Not since Little House on the Prairie has there been a series until When Calls the Heart and if you loved the Little House Series or simply love a great family series set in the Old West, then you will LOVE this one. I easily give this a 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait for the next season to air on the Hallmark Channel. Fans of Love Come Softly will absolutely LOVE this one as well. The chemistry between Elizabeth and Jack is so strong it won't take much to light these two on fire and that is part of the appeal as well as the love Elizabeth brings to school the children of Coal Valley in the town's saloon to teach them there is more to life than working in the mines.",1404604800,5,2952,4.442804428044281
6397161,5,B00JXVPY8K,"My wife and I have enjoyed watching this series. At first we were a bit skeptical because we had watched the pilot prior to the series and liked the actors in that, only to find that the actors had been changed in the series. As we got into the series though we ended up falling in love with the characters and the writing. The series is well written and directed with strong acting and characterization. This DVD really brings you into the series and you get to see the start of some of the love that begins between Elizabeth and Jack as well as a catch when Billy comes on the scene. The two episodes were fun and engaging and leave you wanting to watch more, or at least they did for my wife and I. All-in-all this was a well done DVD, and I for one am looking forward to the next season!

6397162,4,B00JXVPY8K,"Thank you Edify Media for this review copy.

Love is a complicated matter.  More so when there's a triangle.  That's just what is created when Billy Hamilton comes to town to mine.  I don't know about you, but I think that a man reciting poetry is very romantic.  Jack and Elizabeth struggle to communicate with each other while Billy smoothly speaks sweet poetic words that spark Elizabeth's attention and Jack's suspicions and jealousy.

I love how expressive the actors and actresses are in this film.  I think we'd understand the plot even if it weren't a ""talkie"" but a silent film.  As usual, there are some words of wisdom shared within the lines of the story as well as some good advice.

This is the fourth in the series that I've viewed.  The first had different actors.  Of the films with the second set of actors, this one is my favorite.  Perhaps it is because I've become accustomed to Coal Valley and its people.  This is a very enjoyable movie.  It's clean enough for the whole family, romantic enough for those who enjoy that, and it has action for those who like that.  My whole family enjoyed it.",1404518400,11,1115,4.5606060606060606

6397183,5,B00JXVPY8K,"With this, the 3rd two-episode DVD compilation of When Calls The Heart, I again marvel at the skill of the shows writers. There are four subplots here: Carla Noonan largely pregnant with child and taken in by Abigail; smooth-talking new-to-town miner Billy Hamilton and his attentions to Elizabeth; humble new miner Dewitt Graves creating waves with young Caleb Dunbar as he tries to get close to Calebs widowed mother Mary; and Jacks investigation and pursuit of a thief. None of these strands competes with the others or predominates. Rather, all are fluidly pieced together to sustain your attention throughout. The Dance 3

I have seen all twelve episodes of Season 1, but its always a joy to revisit them with each DVD release. I love the continuity that the writers build into episodes, even with small mentions: Wendel Backus, former town drunk, is now a proud teetotaler, Elizabeth still burns to a crisp everything she cooks, Young Albert is seen fishing alongside Caleb, and Reverend Anderson is again preaching in the clearing in the woods.

Each subsequent episode of When Calls The Heart expands viewers knowledge of the townspeople of Coal Valley, planting the town and its inhabitants deeper into our hearts. This time we get better acquainted with Mary and Caleb Dunbar and Carla Noonan. And we see new miners arrive in Coal Valley to replace those killed in the mining accident that left so many widowed and fatherless. Two big town functions occur as a result of these men coming to town: The Miners Dance, and The Miners Games. Watching the dance in the saloon and the games on the town square, youll be transported to the old West (albeit, this time, the Canadian West), and what a romp it is! The Dance 4

We are reminded of the character of those who live in Coal Valley: brave, strong, resourceful, kindhearted, generous people. These were harder times in which to live, but they were also simpler. The simplicity of life depicted on screen casts important things into relief: community, family, and loving ones neighbor. Thematically, the focus centers on how our brokenness can be our greatest impediment to building relationships. As Caleb and Dewitt Graves come to terms, and as Elizabeth learns a lesson, the importance of and development of trust is explored.

And, yes, thankfully Elizabeth and Constable Jack make continued inroads. The Dance 5

As always, these episodes are full of humor and pathos. Youll enjoy your respite in Coal Valley, and when you walk away, youll find your burdens lightened and your heart better for having spent time in this little mining town.

Verdict: 5 of 5 Hearts. Touching, Top Notch Positive Family TV. When Calls The Heart: The Dance continues the high-caliber work of this Hallmark Channel original series. Thankfully, Season 1 (which contained 12 episodes) garnered a devoted following and the Hallmark Channel has committed to a second season which will begin airing in May of 2015.

6397184,5,B00JXVPY8K,"As Constable Jack Thornton and school teacher Elizabeth Thatcher's friendship continues to grow, Elizabeth tries to get Jack to ask her to the upcoming miner's dance. Jack tells her he will be on duty, and tells her that, at that time, he has no interest in getting married, listing his reasons for not wanting to put a wife through the struggles of a mountie's life. However, when the group of new miners comes to town, and Mr. Billy Hamilton quickly sets to work wooing Elizabeth,  Jack suddenly starts getting jealous - even though he won't admit it, even to himself. Sensing that Billy is not the man he claims to be, Jack looks into his background,  and finds out that the man is indeed a fraud. When he tries to warn Elizabeth,  however,  she becomes offended,  because she feels that Jack is being unfair to Billy, whom she believes is a perfect gentleman. There are several robberies,  and Jack, of course,  suspects Billy. Recruiting the aid of Cat Montgomery, Jack sets a trap for the thief,  who turns out NOT to be Billy. While some of the ladies are busy helping one of the widows,  who is in labor, Jack goes to Elizabeth to apologize for accusing Billy of being a thief, asking her forgiveness for hurting her, stating that her well-being was all he cared about. Billy finally slips up in his words with Elizabeth, allowing her to finally see that he is, as Jack had warned,  a con man. While Jack and Elizabeth are having a conversation about Billy, Jack catches him stealing a horse to slip out of town. At the end, Jack and Elizabeth are holding the twins that had been born, and Jack comments that he could get used to holding a baby. Elizabeth is surprised,  and  Jack looks at her and says ""Maybe someday."" Elizabeth comments that the mountie is softening up. Then they smile..... :-) I WOULD GIVE THIS SERIES 10 STARS IF I COULD!! This dvd contains episodes 5 and 6 from the Hallmark tv series.",1410048000,4,1916,4.537790697674419

6397191,4,B00JXVPY8K,"When Calls the Heart - The Dance is a feature length film from two episodes of the When Calls the Heart television series. When new miners are hired to help with the reopening of the Coal Valley mine, the town decides to celebrate with a dance. One of those new miners takes a special interest in Elizabeth (Erin Krakow) and showers her with attention and poetry. With Jack's (Daniel Lissing) insistence that the life of a Mountie is too difficult to share with a wife, Billy Hamilton's (Andrew W. Walker) flattery tugs at Elizabeth's heart.

In a side story, one of the widows (Laura Bertram) is also attracted to one of the new miners (Derek Hamilton. However, her son (Will Verchere-Gopaulsingh) is not ready to have another man in his mom's life. Tensions increase as she struggles to extinguish her growing feelings that equal her son's resentment.

The celebrations of the new miners, a dance and the Miner's Games is not the only cause for joy, though. Widow Carla Noonan (Jill Morrison) is expecting her baby soon. However, the excitement is tempered with trepidation since there is no doctor available. Carla has moved in with Abigail (Lori Loughlin) and Elizabeth has her time grows nearer, but will the women of Coal Valley be able to care for her when she goes into labor early?

Once again, this is a well acted and well written film that keeps the viewer interested and endears these characters even more. There are a few twists here and there that lend to the excitement of the story, along with the poignancy of letting go and moving forward. You must believe that Jack and Elizabeth will realize their love for one another, but will misunderstandings cause a permanent rift? Also, realizing the hardships many of our ancestors faced gave me a greater appreciation of my blessings. If you haven't seen the previous When Calls the Heart DVDs, you will want to get in on the beginning of the series. You will fall in love with the people of Coal Valley. It deserves 4.5 stars.
