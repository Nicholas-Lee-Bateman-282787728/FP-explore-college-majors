amazing and just gets better with repeated viewing.

Winged Migration is the closest follow up to BARAKA, yet. Get this set.

Unbelievable, breathless, makes you yearn to fly. No narration, just music and an inspirational journey.  Winged Migration makes

the human race look so shameful - to see what these migratory birds must

face in order to make their annual roundtrip - Like the film, An Inconvenient Truth, we owe it these creatures to clean up the mess on this planet if we wish to survive.  If the animals die because of our

pollutions, then we too are doomed.

Amazon, hurry up and get this set so I can buy it!!!!!",1178841600,,698,4.556451612903226
