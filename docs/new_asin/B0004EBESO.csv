8036083,5,B0004EBESO,"David Lynch has said that Hollywood movies are too concerned with the audience always knowing what is happening at all times. He's right. Life isn't like that. Everyday you see interesting and sometimes odd (sometimes bizzare) things happening and don't really understand what it was you just witnessed. You hear snigglets of conversation and wish you had all of the details...sometimes you get more details but are still left with questions that will never be answered. Lynch sometimes reflects this in his work. Lost Highway probably more so than any other movie of his. The scenes are incredible and there is (I believe) an explanation to it all...sometimes I can almost figure it out...but in the end I'm left with some questions. But it doesn't matter, because the ride is so scenic and enjoyable that I'm not really hung up on the destination. Lynch said he had OJ Simpson on his mind while writing this movie...so keep that in mind. Sometimes we see the world as we want to see it and not how it really is...sometimes we live in a delusional world. My friend just got divorced and she admitted to me that she honestly wasn't as happy as she had convinced herself she was while she was married. The way she saw her world while married was much different than the way it really was. And sometimes when a person who has been living in a delusional reality is confronted with things the way they really are, they can't accept it and either end up in therapy or in a white bronco riding slowly along some lost highway.",1143417600,3,1520,4.633333333333334
8036084,5,B0004EBESO,"It is worth twice what they are asking for it.  Buy this film.  You probably won't get it all on the first viewing, so you'll want to watch it multiple times.  This is the film that turned me on to the twisted world of David Lynch.  This film is a rare gem and is very difficult to find on DVD.  While you are at it, buy Mulholland Drive as well.",1132963200,2,346,3.8857142857142857
