8088029,4,B000BKDNUI,The DVD  lists the cars featured on the back  among them a  1970 Oldsmobile 442. There is a 1968  442 featured but if you buy it expecting to see a 1970 Cutlass you will  be disappointed. There is an Oldsmobile Birthday party  feature and if you look close you will catch about 5 seconds  of two 1970  Cutlasses but they are NOT featured on this Dvd.,1486857600,,350,4.196969696969697

8088032,5,B000BKDNUI,"Great DVD. You can't go wrong with Dennis Gage, he smiles from ear to ear (if you can see a smile through that mustache) when he gets to run some of these great cars.

I bought it for the Buick's and Buick's were well shown in this DVD, buy it you will enjoy it !!!",1295568000,3,265,3.8181818181818183
