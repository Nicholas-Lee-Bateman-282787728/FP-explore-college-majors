1367095,4,B00004XMSB,"A cult film among Arnold followers - his first ""acting"" attempt.  Campy like a comic book.  Acting is stupifyingly bad, but there's a few pretty well known character actors in this. Can't understand how the female lead got into this - watch the flick and you'll understand. Arnold was near peak of his body-building career and it shows (he flexes those latt's, and it's like eclipse of the sun). There was a great documentary with Arnold, Lou Ferrigno & Franco Columbo called ""Pumping Iron"".

1367104,4,B00004XMSB,The movie was good for older released entertainment.

He has a fun adventure in New York City, just enough to convince him he should have listened to his father.  He returns a wiser, humbler Hercules.  If you are prepared to laugh at the contrived antics, you will have a hilarious evening.  You probably won't need to watch it again for a long time.  I bought it to amuse my Latin students.",1381881600,,456,4.421686746987952
1367110,5,B00004XMSB,This is one of the best movies that Arnold has ever done while he has been acting and I'd personally recommend this movie to anyone.,1379116800,,132,4.32
1367111,1,B00004XMSB,"The 1969 movie HERCULES IN NEW YORK proves noteworthy for two reasons.  First, it is the film debut of Arnold Schwarzenegger (billed as Arnold Strong).  Second, it is proof that there's hope for actors who turn in as wooden a performance as Schwarzenegger does in this flick.  Not that he went on to become the most versatile of big screen stars, but Schwarzenegger developed enough acting talent to hold up his end in a string of hit films in the 1980s and '90s.  Not bad for a second career.

Previous HERCULES IN NEW YORK reviews articulate the movie's flaws, so I won't make you read about them again. All I can add is that as Hercules' new friend in HERCULES IN NEW YORK, the late Arnold Stang does his best to carry the moment.  Too bad Stang can't un-cheapen the production values, re-stage the terrible fight scenes, or fast-forward Schwarzenegger into the 1980s, when the former Mr. Universe would be ready for his next lead role in a film.",1377043200,,949,4.585798816568047
1367112,2,B00004XMSB,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's first starring role was in this hilariously bad 1969 revamping of Greek mythology, in which curiosity leads hunk Hercules to visit earth in defiance of his father Zeus. Even a simple description of the film leads into the surreal: New York's Central Park, of all places, serves as a setting for Olympus, with no effort at all to keep from the soundtrack the sounds of traffic from the adjoining streets and, in some scenes, of children from a nearby playground. The acting is on the level of a sub-par high school play, the screenplay worse than that, and the costumes of the Greek gods are like something kids might make themselves for Hallowe'en. Choicest scene: Arnold in Central Park wrestling down an escaped grizzly bear who is hilariously obviously a man in a bear suit. The film attempts to emphasize its Greek associations by using a soundtrack composed of what sounds like the same 45 second clip of cheesy Greek tourist restaurant bouzouki music repeated endlessly.

Really a one star film, cinematically, but give it an extra star for the so-bad-it's-good camp value, and the interest of seeing a very young Arnold Schwarzenegger before he even tried to learn how to act.

Best line: ""Ha! Ha! Ha! You have strucked Hercules.""

No advisories, but if you have kids, you probably don't want to let them catch you watching something this dumb.

Though the DVD pictured in the amazon record is labeled Lions Gate, it's really put out by Trimark. It offers the option of the ""Theatrical sound track,"" in which Schwarzenegger's voice is dubbed into standard-accented American English, or the original soundtrack with his own voice. The dubbing is very ineptly done, and some bad movie fans prefer the dubbed version for that very reason, since it adds to the film's badness; personally, I'd advise listening to the original soundtrack with Schwarzenegger's still very heavily accented English, which makes his portrayal of a Greek demigod even weirder. The DVD transfer is adequate, or, given the film's general shoddiness, maybe the transfer is good but the original print is just lousy.",1371081600,,2117,5.005681818181818

1367117,2,B00004XMSB,"The dual billing of Arnold Stang and Arnold ""Strong"" is the first hint to this film's cult legacy. Old-timey comedian Arnold Stang and the future gubernator team up in this hammy and cheesy fish-out-of-the-Mediterranean film from 1969. Most of the supporting cast is made of petrified wood, though veteran actor James Karen was somehow enticed into this Z-grade effort.

But Hercules in New York would really only be worth watching with snarky commentary. The only reason I didn't rate it one-star is because of the laugh factor. But the laugh factor isn't high enough.

1367125,2,B00004XMSB,"14 years before he was The Terminator, and 12 before he was Conan, Austria's biggest import Arnold Schwarzenegger made his debut on the big screen as Hercules in ""Hercules in New York"". This film happens to turn out to be very awful because of its highly noticeable flaws, yet these flaws happen to make this one of the greatest in unintentional comedy.

Arnold's role as Hercules is hilarious at best. When listening to him speak in the non-dubbed version (I'll get to that in a bit!), his Austrian accent is so thick that it's hard to make out a good portion of the words he's saying. Keep in mind that this was filmed almost right when he got off the boat, and because of his accent, the audio was originally dubbed over, with the only audible sounds coming from the actors in the dubbed release. If you want sound effects, you have to watch the version with the original audio.

When it comes to the acting, well, I'll say that Hercules may be stronger than your average tree, but he sure is a lot more wooden. Arnold makes the same facial impression in almost every scene, and of course, he'll show off his abs because he didn't get the title of Mr. Universe for nothing. Then there's Top Cat, I mean, the late Arnold Stang, who just had to have phoned his performance in. As for the rest of the actors, they probably managed to take some people off the streets of New York and bribed them to act like 2 by 4's throughout the film.

Other crazy, noteworthy things to know about this film is that in ""Mt. Olympus"" (I use that loosely), they manage to have the traffic as bad as they have it in New York City. The sound effects in general sound cartoonish, whether it's a fight or whatever else happens to take place in the city that never sleeps. Speaking of fights, I saved the best part for last: the bear fight, or should I say, Arnold vs. some guy wearing a hand-me-down bear suit that looks like it was bought at Value Village for one dollar. If there is one reason you have to see that movie, it's that one-of-a-kind battle between demigod and beast.

When it comes to campy film that makes Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick, you can't go wrong with this classic. Of course, I'm not going to give it an all out 5 for how ridiculous it is, or a 1 for how many times it made me laugh, so I'll be fair and give it a 2 for managing to be one of those ""so bad it's excellent"" type of films. See it at least once; Lionsgate actually uploaded the full film for free on YouTube for the undubbed glory, and Hulu did the same for the less entertaining dubbed version.",1294531200,2,2567,4.308488612836439
1367126,3,B00004XMSB,"Arnold Schwarzenegger sure came a long way.  Before he rose to action stardom and made his Austrian mark in the U.S. Government, he was in ""Hercules in New York"", 90 minutes of Mr. Universe 1969 flexing his biceps.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-wasn-t-the-path-to-career-stardom-he-was-looking-for/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That wasn't the path to career stardom he was looking for.</a>

Out of circumstances, I had to watch this movie twice: first on the overdubbed version, and second with the original AHNOLD voice.  The overdubbed version had severe audio problems, mainly the music and sound effects have been entirely absent, and the movie makes that loud, irritating hissing sound whenever Hercules talks (I must've seen a bad copy); this viewing was more audibly muted than a silent film.  The original version thankfully has all of the sounds intact, because I would've rated this movie 2 stars otherwise.  Arnold's voice was utterly incomprehensible, much more that he is now; his over-burly accent was worse than Tor Johnson, Tommy Wiseau and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Moo/dp/B000EBGEBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Moo</a>&nbsp;combined.  He mumbles and half of his dialogue are indistinct, so his performance was a barrel of laughs.  But at least it's AHNOLD's own voice, not some bored voice actor who's reading over the lines without any passion or effort.  It's the actor's own uncanny ability that made it worth watching, among a few other things.

As for the story, well, Hercules is a narcissistic, sexist jerk who speaks in the third person (so Arnold's really playing himself).  He angered his dad Zeus, and Zeus zapped him from the heavens to go to Earth.  After being dropped to New York, he then met a nebbish pretzel-seller named Prezzi, who makes Rick Moranis look like Hugh Jackman. Together, they face off against mobsters, greek gods, and escaped zoo animals.  Yep.  It's not just the story that's horrible, even the costumes (nice ascot, Hades), the sets, and the editing was on the lowest common denomination. The actors, most of all, delivered some of the most asinine dialogue I've heard, like when Prezzi mistaken tea for drugs. TEA FOR DRUGS, How did he come up with that connection? Is this a 1960s colloquialism that I don't know about?  And then there's the greek score, which happens to play the same happy melody for the entire film, even when Hercules got his tight abs handed to him.

(USA - 1969)

Aspect ratio: 1.37:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Against his father's direct orders, Hercules (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leaves Olympus and journeys to Earth, where he enjoys a series of wild adventures.

Micro-budget fluff, designed to showcase the strength, agility and fantastic physique of bodybuilding champion Schwarzenegger (billed as 'Arnold Strong'), here making his feature debut. Production values never rise above porno level (Zeus' kingdom consists of nothing more than a plastic throne and a couple of drapes, filmed in a public park!), and the sound quality fluctuates from shot to shot (you can hear traffic somewhere beyond the aforementioned 'magic' kingdom!!). On top of the meandering plot and rotten visual effects (get a load of the 'rampaging grizzly', actually a guy in flea-bitten bear suit!), the movie is further handicapped by Schwarzenegger's dreadful performance - he's fine while showing off his torso, but his flat monotone delivery is in sharp contrast to some talented supporting players, including well-known character actors James Karen and Richard Herd (what were they thinking?).

If nothing else, however, the movie provides an opportunity for viewers to feast their eyes on Schwarzenegger's magnificent body, which he displays at every opportunity. Oh, and look out for the scene in which he steers a horse-drawn carriage down the middle of Times Square, an iconic image which transcends the rough material in which it's featured. Directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman.

NB. In an alternate version of the film, Arnie is dubbed with god-like hamminess by an uncredited voice artist. That one's even funnier!",1256688000,,1678,5.484496124031008

I give this movie 4 stars because in terms of being a ""good movie"" I.E. Oscar material, it is not.  I seriously doubt they were going for that in the first place, so does it really matter?  Was Commando Oscar material? No - but it was still hilarious, intentional or not.

1367130,5,B00004XMSB,"Hercules introduced the world to Arnold. Who would have known that the man starring in this film would soon be a governor of California?

You really can't blame Arnold for starring in this film. The film was a great start for Arnold, and it fits him well. His charming personality that makes him so popular really shows in this film. Every sentence that Arnold utters in this movie is memorable.

The acting in the movie is typical of a low budget film. Half the time, it seems like everyone is reading off a cue card somewhere off camera. Most notably Arnold appears to be having difficulty with some dialogs; half the time he stares awkwardly like he's trying to read a cue card somewhere off camera. Apart from the cheesy dialogs, the chorography is comical and unbelievable. Half the time it appears Arnold is just randomly running around doing things for no apparent reason. From stopping a forklift while running away from a gang of thugs, to fighting a bear that is obviously a man in a cheap five dollars costume, the film is non-stop hilarious.

Arnold first movie might be considered horrible, but despite all of its shortcomings, I think the movie was well made. It fits Arnold's charming self, and it introduced the world to Arnold as an actor. If anything can be said about Arnold is that he looked huge in this movie. Aside from Conan and perhaps the first Terminator, Arnold was probably the biggest he ever been in Hercules and that made him fit the role well.

1367137,5,B00004XMSB,"Hercules in New York (a.k.a. Hercules Goes Bannanas) was Arnold's first movie that he ever made. It originally came out in 1970 in which it tanked something fierce.

Part of this was justified as the movie itself is terrible in addition to the fact that since the studio felt like that no one would understand Arnold due to his thick Austrian accent, they got some Steve McQueen soundalike to dub Arnold's lines throughout the film.

The best part of this DVD is that it features both the original audio track featuring Arnold's actual voice in addition to the dubbed track.

A huge part of how much you'll enjoy this so-bad-it's-great movie depends on how big of an Arnold fan you are. I grew up with Arnold's films in the 80's and I remember how almost every kid wanted to be Arnold back in the day.

While it does get kind of tough to discern what he's actually saying, that's a huge part of the film's charm.  While the whole plot (Hercules gets bored and decides against Zeus' wishes to go on a trip to New York to ""fool around"") is stupid, Arnold's charm was already on display in spades in this film which makes it work in a weird way.

Almost about every line he utters in this movie is memorable. Mainly due to his thick accent and how the lines end up being delivered.  He was also right in the thick of his body building career as well during the making of this film so as a result, other than Pumping Iron and Conan, you'll not likely see another Arnold movie in which he was more built.

The rest of the cast is uniformly terrible, in addition to Arnold Stang as Pretzy.  Stang had a huge career doing voices for Hanna Barbara cartoons but he really needed to just stay behind the scenes as his wretched performance in this movie will prove.

The movie has a super cheap look to it and literally looks like the budget was maybe 100 dollars.

Anybody who loves cheesy B-movies or Arnold films in general will really get a kick out of this awful movie as it is still a whole lot of fun.

Others need not apply and should stay far, far away from this one.

1367138,1,B00004XMSB,with voice by someone other than arnold this movie falls into the realm of the if he weren't famous this one would never see the light of day. really the worst. skip it!,1149120000,,169,4.151515151515151
1367139,4,B00004XMSB,"I've always been a big fan of Arnold, and this movie really lets him shine. One highlight (of many in the film) is the confusing/embarrassing scene where Arnold misunderstands being invited over by the Professor & his daughter for ""tea"" (beatnik-era term for marijuana). And then there's the sordid scene where a booze-addled Arnold confesses what he saw in the hotel room that he shares with Hercules. This scene alone whisks the movie out of the kiddie genre it seems to be lumped into and takes it to another level completely. Yes, as Pretzy, Arnold Stang delivers in spades.

And then there's Arnold Schwarzenegger. His English wasn't very good at the time this was made, but this ain't Shakespeare he's reciting, either. Even at this early point in his career, it's obvious the man had the makings of an actor or politician.

The fact that this movie was made in 1970, long after the peplum craze was over gives it added appeal for me. Also, the character of Hercules in this movie as a big, strong lummox instead of a noble hero was truer to Greek mythology than most movies portray him and makes it my favorite of the genre. The scene where he has a mini-tantrum after losing the weight lifting competition, stamping his feet and giving a good Herman Munster ""darn, darn, darn!"" impersonation is a fine example. Although you can listen to Arnold's original audio, I prefer the dubbed Dad-voiced audio option myself.

Other favorite scenes: Hercules falling outside an airplane window & waving at an old lady passenger on the plane, and the scene in Times Square where Hercules takes off his shirt & makes his pecs move up and down for the Professor's daughter.",1143417600,,1667,4.7612456747404845
1367140,4,B00004XMSB,"Let's get one thing straight. This is an ultra low budget movie with all of the trappings that come from that. It's Arnold Schwarzenegger's first movie appearance and it shows. So why does it get such a nice rating from me? Because the movie is so much fun to watch! I'll be the first to admit this movie isn't for everyone, but for those of you who enjoy a little camp now and then will truly get a kick out of Hercules in New York.

Lets start with the dubbing. Oh, the wonderful dubbing. Arnold has been dubbed out of the movie and replaced by a voice that reminds me of a radio or TV personality. The new voice is completely out of character with the way Schwarzenegger looks. It's great camp value. I had the pleasure of checking out the included undubbed version with true Arnold dialog. Trust me, it's good they dubbed him (I am 'hur-koo-leeeeze'). Either dub you listen to will be very funny by the way. The ""theatrical"" version for it's too-perfect voice casting and the unedited version for Arnold stumbling over the lines with little or no actual acting.

Suprisingly enough some of the actual acting is quite good. I particularly liked Michael Lipton as Pluto, Arnold Stang as 'Pretzie' and Ernest Graves as Zeus. Schwarzenegger, bless his heart, just isn't up to par on this movie. It's perfectly understandable as he just made the move from his body building career so he hasn't had the experience yet. Besides that's fun to watch too.

There's plenty more camp value where that came from. Sound effects can be out of place like when you hear car tires burning rubber while driving in the grass. Props are funny with things like Zeus' thunderbolts made from industrial galvanized steel rods. And wait until you see the fight scene with the escaped bear. Sure they keep mixing up the names of greek gods with their roman counterparts. Sure stuff like serious cinematography and lighting were thrown out the window, but as unforgivable those aspects are for many mythology and movie buffs I just can't help finish this movie with a smile on my face.

One final thing to mention is the music. The opening credit score is extremely cheesy, but when you actually get to the movie you are treated with some authentic greek music. I mean the kind of music they play at traditional parties with mandolins and lutes. It's really fun to listen while you see Arnold romp around tossing people or things all over the place. Hats off to John Balamos for the music.

In case you haven't noticed I love Hercules in New York because it was done bad, but with LOTS of style. If you're not into campy movies then you probably won't enjoy it. If you're a Schwarzenegger fan with a sense of humor go rent it. For everybody else it really depends on how forgiving you will be for all of the low-budget fallacies. I say check it out just for the experience alone. Just make sure you get the version with both the dubbed and the original Arnold dialog and get the best bang for your buck.",1141862400,8,2979,4.550373134328358

He makes a friend named Pretzy. After watching this you'll know where the Jerky Boys got their Sol Rosenburg character. Anyway, Arnie demonstrates to a college Olympic team how to throw a jav and a discus and creates quite an impression on a college professor and his cute daughter.

Arnie becomes a wrestler and does a weight-lifting competition on TV. He loses though because his strength was zapped by Nemises.

My favorite seen was when Arnie and the chick are walking through the park. Check out Arnie as he trips on the sidewalk. You would think they would have refilmed the scene and left the original as a 'blooper' scene, but they left it in.

1367149,3,B00004XMSB,"I love Hercules movies, so yesterday, I decided to watch Hercules in New York, also known as Hercules Goes Bananas.  This was Arnold Schwarzenegger's (called Arnold Strong in the credits) first flick, his role garnered by the misleading claim of his agent that he had years of stage experience.  Of course, the stage experience was in bodybuilding, not theatre.

Still, Arnold's lack of acting experience didn't stop this movie from being made, and somehow, despite such horrendous beginnings, Arnold has since gone on to become a big name in both movies and politics.  One particularly eerie line uttered by an Olympian in the movie states that Herc might eventually become the president of the United States.  Oh my.

Although I wouldn't consider Arnold to be a master thespian now, his acting and diction have improved enormously since 1970.  Hercules in New York is one of those wonderful movies that is so bloody awful, it's an absolute gem.  Herc bulldozes his way  through NYC with narcissistic chutzpah, thick muscles, and an even thicker ""Greek"" accent.  He is Captain Kirkian in his ability to shed his shirt at a moment's notice, and doesn't waste an opportunity to flex his enormous muscles.

Hercules in New York suffers from some of the same problems as Plan 9 From Outer Space:  terrible dialogue, dreadful blocking, incompetent direction, bad actors, and nonexistent continuity.  For example, during the climactic fight between Herc and a man in a bear suit, it vacillates between day and night.

I hadn't realized Olympians were into shabby chic.  Zeus's throne is in a state of disrepair, and his thunderbolts are fashioned of rebar.  To top it off, Venus is homely.

I think my favourite part of the whole movie is when Nemesis chats with Pluto at the gates of Hades.  A dog barks in the background (ostensibly Cerberus, who argues with himself incessantly), and at one point, a truck horn honks loudly.  Nice touch, don't you think?

It's also a nice touch when Atlas and Samson are sent to give aid to a divinity-stripped Hercules.  Shouldn't Alas be holding up the sky or something?  And shouldn't Samson be in the Bible?  Ah well.  Who cares?  Obviously not the writers!

As of today, Hercules in New York is ranked #33 in the bottom 100 on IMDB.  That sounds about right.  Hercules in New York is a must-see for connoisseurs of bad cinema.  It's hard to believe it wasn't given the treatment by the MST3K guys.",1094774400,6,2434,4.839805825242719
1367150,5,B00004XMSB,"Folks, this is a real gem! They don't make these kinds of movies any more, and it's a damn shame too.

I STRONGLY urge you to watch both versions of this movie. In the first, Arnold's voice is not dubbed, and his accent is extremely thick. His English was not exactly up to snuff so he delivers most of his lines with absolute hilarity. My favourites are ""You have striked Hercules!"" and ""Why he always got to be necking me?"" If you're not laughing within 5 minutes of this movie something is definitely wrong.

The second version is where Arnold's voice is dubbed. Many say this version is even funnier since Arnold's voice is dubbed by what sounds like a 70 year old English professor. The lines are delivered in such a tepid and uninspired fashion that one can't help but to laugh uncontrollably!

Savor Arnold flexing his muscles and pecs, the bad acting, or overacting, on par with that of a porn film (Ernest Graves as Zeus and Michael Lipton as Pluto are by far the best), the horrible yet at times very funny dialog, the frenetic zither music, the cheesy special effects (as bent, silver-painted rebars representing thunder bolts), scenes of 1969 New York City, especially Central Park, and incongruities such as biblical Samson and New York City traffic noise vying with the Greek mythological figures. Extras include trailers for the original 1970 release and the 1982 re-release that coincided with Arnold's Conan the Barbarian (1982).

1367156,3,B00004XMSB,"Low budget is the key phrase in describing this film debut of the pre-'Pumping Iron"" Mighty Ripped One, Arnold. But don't let that keep you from enjoying the film, flaws and all, for it really is a lark and a half. The movie is also known as ""Hercules Goes Bananas"", and that ought to tell you something.
The music is heavily zithered, a la ""The Third Man"", but seems oddly appropriate to the film. It actually grows on you, believe it or not. We get an interesting view of the gods hanging out on Mount Olympus, and we meet a dashing Pluto (AKA Death). Tony 'Mr. World' Carroll cameos in a weightlifting contest with Herc, and ""Dark Shadows"" alum Tracy Loomis plays Herc's love interest, Helen. Soap opera regular Ernest Graves steals all of his scenes as Zeus.
On the DVD, you can choose between the Real Arnold voice track, and the dubbed voice track. I sampled the dubbed version, and then quickly opted for the Real Arnold, with his classic Arnold accent that renders him almost unintelligible (""Eye yam Her-cue-leesse!""). The dubbing is classic in it's own way, however, with the ridiculously deep, white, all-American, manly voice so common to dubbed pictures of Herc, et al. But, with an Arnold movie, we need the sound of Arnold's own vocal undulations as he navigates the rocky waters of the English language.
Arnold Stang actually gets top billing over Arnold Strong (Schwarzenegger). Stang was a memorable, but largely forgotten comedian from the golden age of television. Perhaps most memorable for the voices of ""Top Cat"" (Hanna-Barbera)and ""Herman"" (Famous Studios), Stang also appeared in ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"". Here, Stang plays the goofy schlub ""Pretzie"" (so named because he sells pretzels), a perpetually bewildered person who befriends the bewildered Herc.
Herc has been cast out of Olympus for talking smack to his dad, Zeus.  Herc wants to meet new people, and see the mortal world, and when Zeus gets tired of hearing about it, he hurls a lightning bolt (which looks suspiciously like a bent piece of re-bar that was spray painted silver), and POOF! Herc is falling to Earth. Before you know it, he's teaching athletes how to throw the discus and javelins, becoming outraged when he sees a movie poster for a Herc movie, beating up escaped grizzly bears, etc. He also starts making time with the daughter of a college professor (with an interest in mythology, of course), and takes up wrestling.
Half the fun is Arnold's acting. The other half is the valiant attempt of the filmmakers in making lemons out of lemonade on their skimpy budget. Stang is a bit over the top at times, but really helps to keep things moving in a typical kid's movie kind of way.
Probably the biggest flaw with the movie is that the relationship between Herc and Helen is never resolved. In fact, Helen inexplicably vanishes before the movie is all wrapped up. The movie does end delightfully, with the mighty Zeus casting an eye towards his old stomping grounds, but the loose ends are kind of annoying.
Besides the dual voice track, the DVD also offers some TV spots from the movie's 1980 re-release (post-""Conan""), in which Arnold is given heavy play.
The DVD is a must-have for Arnold fans, or fans of low-budget dreck for the 70's. Suitable as a guilty pleasure, or as a treat for the kid in all of us.",1065052800,30,3317,4.7387543252595155

I can't believe how hard I laughed at the ""Grizzly Bear"" scene, which magically transforms from an ""American brown bear"" to a ""Grizzly bear"" (look at the sign at the zoo, then listen to the radio transmission by the police). This goes to show that the director had NO IDEA WHATSOEVER of what he was doing.
The seen where ""Herc"" fights the bear is so ridiculous, that you just have to laugh! This film is one of the all-time best ""cheap"" films, following in the steps of all the others before it.
I was lucky enough to view this on AMC, where they provided the version where Arnold ""Strong"" Schwarzenegger ISN'T dubbed.
He got the part of Hercules because his agent told the director of the film that Arnold spoke great English. What a laugh, right there!
If you enjoyed such ""classic,"" dare I say, films like ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"" then you'll love ""Hercules in New York,"" which co-stars Arnold Stang as ""Pretz"" I believe was his name.
Overall, depending on what perspective you view this film in, is what you will get. Advice? Watch it from a comedy perspective.

1367160,3,B00004XMSB,"Hercules, played by big Arnie, is banished from Mount Olympus, so journeys to Earth and boards a container ship bound for New York. Here he befriends a nebbish named Pretzi- so named because he is a pretzel salesman, talk about your life being pre-destined;who comes off as sort of a whinier, tenth- rate Woody Allen. Of course, Herc falls in love with a beautful Earth woman who he thinks is a goddess, though her father thinks of him as ""a Greek peasant with delusions of mythological grandeur"". The movie's most intelligent and insightful dialogue. Highlights include Arnold wrestling a guy in a bear suit and becoming a pro-wrestler as result!
Another snippet of the hilarious dialogue comes from Zeus (Herc's dad): ""If I had known how much trouble he (Herc) would cause me, I would have thought twice when I met his mother on my vacation""! And in the climactic Mt. Olympus scene you can hear the sounds of passing traffic in the background!
HERCULES IN NEW YORK is one of those so bad they're good movies, and this is pretty hard to pass up if only to see a badly dubbed Schwarzenegger in his movie debut (though the DVD restores his voice track). Makes an interesting Double Bill with THE TERMINATOR.",1042070400,,1206,4.693396226415095
1367161,3,B00004XMSB,"Atlantic Monthly used to (and maybe still does) have a short column on unlikely, but true, meetings of historically significant figures. Frequently there would be some irony about the circumstances or the juxtaposition of the individuals and their images or personalities. Hercules in New York is a perfect, previously unrecognized joinup of two great Arnolds of American entertainment, Schwarzenegger and Stang. Ironically, at the time this was made, the diminutive and irritating Arnold Stang was the better known of the two, based on his television, commercial and cartoon voiceover work. Needless to say, the situations reversed over the next ... years, and in recent years Mr. Stang has been reduced to more voiceovers and occasional bit parts. Still, during his prime he cut a memorable swath playing the standard role of an ineffectual, undersized, asexual, wimpish, nasal voiced New Yorker, who nonetheless had an indefatigable drive as the foil for a main character who was more forceful, but less intelligent. It's a shame that today Arnold Stang isn't as well remembered as the individual who had second billing under the stage name of Arnold Strong. Both men in their own way have left an indelible mark on campy American entertainment.",1031443200,2,1248,5.245
1367162,5,B00004XMSB,"YES! The movie that started it all. Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""THE GENIUS"" was born in this riveting picture of rebellion and coming-of-age. I was cheering when Hercules (Schwarzenegger) said ""no"" to his father Zeus and visited Earth for the first time. Olympus was in a state of shock as the gigantic god propelled to New York City. There he beat up a group of sailors and met an annoying old man. The old man booked Hercules in some weight-lifting competitions, but Hercules lost his powers! Appalling! How dare Zeus for doing such a thing to Arnold Schwarzenegger! Then Hercules fell in love with a young lady whom she thought was odd. Funny lady. Zeus eventually let Hercules prosper and live in happiness with the mortals. Hercules got into more fights with some piddily mortal men and conquered. Rejoice! I loved this movie and it gave me hope to be a genius just like Arnold. After this monumental motion picture, Arnold Schwarzenegger became the number one deity of our country, no world.",1022457600,,993,4.847058823529411
1367163,4,B00004XMSB,"Who would have thought that before all those great action movies and ""I'll be back""'s, Arnold S. had already appeared in a cult classic??  I recently watched this movie and have enjoyed it very much, never knowing how cheesy and campy a movie can be?
First, THE reason this movie is brought back on DVD is not for its qualities.  It's just to see Arnie in his first movie where he pulls off a really great BAD performance.  Both versions of the movie are great (on TV, i saw the dubbed version which was funny to see a great Austrian guy with the voice of an English professor with no knowledge of putting intonation in his voice), but i prefer the one with Arnie's almost ridiculous accent.  The story itself is also bad-to-the-bone : Hercules is bored on Olympus and wants to go on a vacation in New York, but Zeus doesn't like this as it would confuse the humans.  Hercules, however, pursues and gets dropped in the sea where a boat picks him up and brings him to New York.  When he arrives, his vacation begins...
The whole movie is worthwhile just because of the cheesy acting of our Arnie.  With the role of Hercules played by an unknown actor, the movie would have gone into obscurity from the moment it hit the theaters, but Arnie stays the main reason to watch this.  Highlight is the fight against a grizzly bear who fights as a human and also lays for death on the ground as a human (his arms spread!!!)
Searchig a serious film about Greek mythology?? Keep away.  Looking for a ""so bad it becomes good"" movie, you are in heaven with this little cult gem.",1013731200,31,1565,4.40625
1367164,5,B00004XMSB,"this film is clearly one of my favourites.
i don't like people just seeing it as a joke. it is really a good film. ARNOLDS FIRST!! a cool film indeed. hercules is bored and wan'ts to good down to new york. he has a little bit hard to fit in because of his enormous strongness and superior god attitude. he gets in several fights....
however he founds one friend pretzy. who he hangs out with. but still as a god walkin down the street in new york isint the easiest thing to do, look out for trouble.....
this film is great even if its recorded 69/70 and yes i saw the version with the dubbing. why complian on flat, still straight well read lines. i'm very glad i can hear what hercules is saying.
my favourite quote of the film is when he runs down to a sports areana and talk's to the coach
""i want t show them how to throw the discuss"" if they are recordholdrs they don't throw it far enough
herc then says.  coach anwsers ""you don't say""...
herc says ""I do say...
great.
another good thing with this film. its just pure fighting and no overdriven explsive things like some cases of eraser, red scorpion or univeersial soldier or end of days or other action films. not to say thats pure bad but somethimes you get tierd of those sort of things.

(Of course I think his voice is pretty sexy)  It is great to see Arnold when he was only 22 or 23 years old.

1367171,4,B00004XMSB,"and that's why Hercules (Arnold Swarzennegger) is itching to leave Mount Olympus and the company of the other gods and take a vacation on Earth in this extremely campy low-budget movie, Arnold's first feature film. Who could have guessed what a superstar he would become?
I find ""HinNY"" a real riot, for a host of reasons. First and foremost, because Arnold's English was apparantly not yet up to snuff, his voice is dubbed in by an unknown actor who gives a wonderfully flat reading of many insipid lines. For instance, when confronted with slang terms for money: ""Bucks? Doe? What is all this zoological talk of male and female animals?"" When picking up women: ""You remind me of someone. A goddess."" Well, perhaps it mighn't look so hilarious in print, but wait til  you hear it in the movie.
Another fun part is how much of the movie was filmed in Central Park; why as a native NYer this really gets to me is that it's the run-down, Lindsay administration Central Park of my childhood. Those who know only the Giuliani/Central Park Conservancy era of the Park would probably be shocked to see how derelict the Bethseda Fountain pavillion appears when Hercules and his newfound girlfriend are walking thru there on a date. I'm delighted to be visually reminded of how far the city has come in this inadvertant documentary of how bad it used to be. Another location featured prominently is the Conservatory Garden up by 103rd Street on the Fifth Avenue side of the Park--this, believe it or not, is Olympus! And speaking of Olympus, that's where another bad set of campy actors and actresses reside, gazing into a big ball (not crystal) to check up on the antics of Hercules down below.

Of course, Arnold does a funny job as Hercules, and certainly never misses an opportunity to flex those pecs and biceps. What a great job, too, he does beating up the bear suited individual who has escaped from the Central Park Zoo and terrorized him and his date on their carriage ride.  Assisting him in various adventures as sidekick is Arnold Stang as Pretzy, his Bronx- accented friend who puts me in mind of a turtle. And for those NYers from the 1970s, you'll be pleased to see the guy who used to be the TV spokesperson for Pathmark cast as a benevolent college professor, whose daughter is Hercules' romantic interest.

This film was never meant to be serious!  It's fun and very entertaining!  The dubbed voice used for Arnold is funny too, but it works!
