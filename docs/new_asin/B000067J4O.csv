1717166,4,B000067J4O,"Well while I would have to be hell of bored (i.e. strapped down and forced to watch) to watch this DVD it will probably be a good thing in the fact that you could put in your DVD player and turn up the volume to listen to some theme songs that have not yet been released on CD yet. [For a couple of dollars], why not? If it sucks you can just say that you are a collector.",1032652800,,372,3.782051282051282
1717263,2,B000067J4O,"""WWE: The Videos, Volume I, Ramped Up"" features the TitanTron entrance videos for 10 of the WWE's top/near top acts.  The entrance videos are those that are played during the WWE Superstars ring entrances.  Overall, while the concept of the entrance videos being released is cool and should be a collector's item for THE MOST HARDCORE of WWE fans, the actual product can safely be called disappointing.
THE ENTRANCE VIDEOS
The DVD features the entrance videos (in their entirety with new footage) for the following superstars:
1. HHH (of course)
2. Hurricane
3. The Undertaker (most recent theme and video)
4. The Rock
5. Billy and Chuck
6. Mr. McMahon
7. Kane (old theme)
8. Y2J Chris Jericho
9. Edge (old video and theme ""You Think You Know Me,"" not Rob Zombie)
10. Kurt Angle
THE CRITICISM:
While I was glad to see that WWE decided to release their Superstar entrance videos on DVD and looked forward to receiving this, I was VERY disappointed to discover how very few videos were on here and how short the DVD is.  This DVD runs only 30 minutes long (about 3 minutes per video) and it contains no extras!
... This is strictly for the most dedicated of WWE collectors/aficionados.
THE VERDICT:
Save your money folks.  ...Easily the worst WWE video release ever.
Avoid",1034035200,11,1270,4.733031674208145
1717264,1,B000067J4O,"I bought this DVD when it came out expecting to see quality videos hopefully having some Easter Eggs.  Well, how wrong I was...I put the DVD in and see a very cheap main menu with crowd noise as the background music.  As I watch the DVD, the videos loop and aren't even the official one, it has new clips that don't even have in the ones they use in WWE TV shows.  There are only 10 videos and this video is 30 minutes long with no special features (other than re-arranging the video, who cares?? lol) The video is 30 minutes long and not worth it.  If you already own WWE RAW for Xbox you can watch the wrestlers AUTHENTIC Entrance Videos and instead of watching just 10 on the RAW for Xbox game you can watch like 50 of them.  Now don't say I didn't warn you, This is probably why the DVD is so cheap, but believe me...the [money]can be used for something even better.  Maybe into the WWE Anthology coming out next month which surely will be a smash hit.",1033948800,,956,4.19672131147541
1717265,4,B000067J4O,"It's really hard to describe this DVD simply because it mostly depends on how much of a WWE fan you are.  If you are a hardcore fan like me then this DVD is right up your alley with new songs not previously released.  If you are not really a big fan then I wouldn't buy this simply because it probably won't hold your interest.  The content of this DVD includes:
1-Triple H entrance
2-The Hurricane entrance
3-The Undertaker (new one) entrance
4-The Rock entrance
5-Billy+Chuck entrance
6-Mr. McMahon entrance (same song, new video)
7-Kane (old entrance, not the Forceable Entry song or video)
8-Chris Jericho entrance
9-Edge entrance (it's not the Rob Zombie song but his new video)
10-Kurt Angle entrance",1033603200,4,706,4.818181818181818
1717266,3,B000067J4O,"there are only 10 videos on this DVD. the videos are extended versions, so you do see parts of the video that you won't see on TV. the entire DVD is only 30 mins, so that's approx. 3 mins for each video. i think it would be a lot better if there were more videos on it....then again, i'm probably biased, cuz my favorite wrestlers entrance videos are not on it.",1033603200,,361,4.098591549295775
1717267,4,B000067J4O,"I thought it had its dissapointments and its good qualities.  If you are buying this DVD for that fact that you want to watch the videos you might get bored. But if u have a backyard fed or something along those lines then it's good for the wrestlers entrances.  But there are only 10 videos on the DVD.  Some of the internet wrestling fans who download these videos will have something to enjoy because the WWE added new clips to each video as opposed to just looping them.  Each video runs about 2.5 minutes.  But it's only about Ten dollars.  So if you're a fan of the show and want it for the themes u should wait for the anthology CD.  But if you are an internet fan who downloads videos you will have something to enjoy.  If you run a basement fed with your friends it's useful because it has HHH, Hurricane, Billy and Chuck, Undertaker (yes his undisputed champ video), Vince McMahon, Edge (old theme new video-no Rob Zombie for some odd reason), Angle, The Rock, Chris Jericho (with lots of him being hell clips), Kane (not Forcable Entry theme).",1033603200,,1054,4.453125
1717268,1,B000067J4O,"This is pretty pathetic, Only 10 Titatron video's? If a DVD can fit 175 minute films like Lord of the Rings onto one Disc then I think it can safely manage more than 10 video's.
I mean, who actually wants to sit down and watch these? You might aswell get a videogame like Smackdown 4 on PS2 or RAW on X-box and watch all the titantron video's on that (I know for a fact that X-box RAW has at least 40 entrance video's). Presuming each titantron video lasts an average of 90 seconds (they loop), then this means they could actually fit 120+ different Superstats titatantron video's on one Disc with sound. I don't even think WWE has that many wrestlers.
Only buy this Disc if you like throwing money away.",1033603200,,704,4.3816793893129775
1717269,5,B000067J4O,"The first thing you hear when a WWE superstar makes his entrance towards to a WWE ring is his entrance music, and the first thing you see when a WWE superstar makes his entrance to the ring is his entrance video on the big screen above the entrance-way. People always asked how could they obtain the themes of the WWE superstars. The answer to that question resulted in 5 volumes of the official entrance themes of the WWE superstars including a rap version album where the entrance themes were made into rap themes for a special rap entrance theme album, and also a rock version album where the entrance themes were made into rock themes for a special rock entrance theme album. So what was the next question, how can I view the entrance videos? While you can go to WWESuperstars.com to view the superstars' entrance videos, you can only view the first 30 seconds of the video. So for the first time ever, World Wrestling Entertainment and WWE Home Video presents... WWE The Videos Vol. 1: Ramped Up. This DVD & VHS includes extended versions of the entrance music videos of 10 WWE superstars- Triple H, The Undertaker, The Rock, Mr. McMahon, Kane, Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle, The Hurricane, & Billy + Chuck. The only special features are that you can play the videos randomly and program your own custom playlist. I think this is a great product at a reasonable price considering the total running time is approx. 30 minutes. The thing I think the DVD lacked was more special features, maybe an interview with Jim Johnston (WWE entrance music composer) and the creator of the entrance videos and some interviews of these WWE superstars about what they think of their entrance music and videos. And it being on DVD, it could of used a few more videos, maybe like 20-30 videos in total, or at least some bonus videos like Stone Cold, Shane McMahon, and some old videos like DX, Corporate Ministry, and Shawn Michaels. One thing I don't understand is why Edge's video is not what you hear on TV. They use the video you see when he makes his entrance, but the music played is the theme from WWF The Music Vol. 3 back when Edge first came to the WWE. I guess it's cause they couldn't get the right to use Rob Zombie's Never Gonna Stop song for his video on this product. But they could of at least used the theme from WWF The Music Vol. 4. But it's still a good product. Hope to see more videos in the Ramped Up series of WWE The Videos.",1033516800,,2433,4.481981981981982
1717270,2,B000067J4O,"When I first heard about the title of this DVD, it sounded kind of cool as I thought that they would have old and new titantron videos like the old D-Generation X, Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, and The Rock videos. Unfortunately, I was let down in a huge way. First of all, there are only 10 entrance videos! Just 10! No DVD extras, nothing! For anyone who's interested, here is the entrance video list:
The Rock
Vince McMahon
Kane
Chris Jericho
Edge
Kurt Angle
The Hurricane
Billy and Chuck
Triple H
The Undertaker
While this is not a bad line up, the WWE should realize that instead of paying [money]for the DVD. People could just as easily go to their website and download these videos. I strongly discourage anyone to buy this.",1033516800,4,743,4.593984962406015
1717271,1,B000067J4O,"Its a good thing I got this DVD on discount and only had to pay 6 bucks because it is useless.  Why u ask, there are only 10 videos on the DVD:  HHH, Undertaker, Rock, Mr. McMahon, Kane, Jericho, Edge(U think u know me-version, not Rob Zombie) Angle, Hurricane and Billy and Chuck.  This DVD might be ok if the songs were in 5.1 digital but its 2.1 garbage.  Save ur money and buy the WWE Anthology, 3 CD set that comes out October 22. Its has over 80 songs on it.",1033430400,,464,4.010869565217392
1717272,3,B000067J4O,I think that this DVD will only be worth it if it has a huge selection of the entrance videos of WWE superstars and if it has the videos in their entirety.,1033171200,,155,3.875
7963344,5,B000067J4O,Great,1459036800,,5,5.0
7963345,4,B000067J4O,this dvd has very good videos....not as many of my favorite wrestlers on it as I might have wanted...but it still has some great full length videos of some very good wrestlers.,1372723200,,176,4.53125
7963346,4,B000067J4O,A great DVD if you are looking for the titan tron videos of your favorite WWE Superstars. Better quality than what you would get on Youtube.  You can truly appreciate the amount of time it took a video editor to piece together each one of these videos. Worth adding to your DVD collection.,1315180800,,289,4.452830188679245
7963347,2,B000067J4O,"Don't buy this!  They had a good ideal, but they just didn't seem to be able to bring this to life.  Not to mention Kurt Angle's video IS NOT WHAT THEY SHOW ON IT!  Please don't waste your money!",1062028800,,195,3.948717948717949
7963348,3,B000067J4O,"I was buying this just to see the clips much like you see on Raw and Smackdown and here's my opinion about it, so here we go:
Triple H: 5/5 Not just because he is my favorite wrestler but the music was great and the clips were unbelieveable.
The Rock: 4/5 Shocked that it was the latest version before he turned heel being that the Anthology was a more ""rocky"" version of it.
Undertaker: 4/5 Doesn't have his new song but still the music fittes with the clips. Just wished it had him holding the American Flag after Summerslam 2002 rather then him pushing Lita off the ring.
Mr. McMahon: 5/5 NO CHANCE IN HELL!!!! Much like Triple H's, great all the way around.
Kane: 2/5 Not his latest music or clips. I'd skip it.
Chris Jericho: 5/5 WOW! Only thing missing is the fireworks.
Edge: 1/5 Very disappointing. Expecting Rob Zombie and you get ""You think you know me"". What a waste!
Kurt Angle: 1/5 Its missing something really important. THE THREE I's. Intelligence, Intergity and Intensity, and it was lacking in this one. Oh yeah? HE HAS HAIR!!!! Show the Bald Angle!
The Hurricane: 3/5 Actually a shocker. I was impressed with this one. STAND BACK, YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE!!
Billy and Chuck: 0/5 What are they doing there. It was released and they have ""broken up"" for a long time. Having RVD's or Chris Benoit's theme would had been better.
Hope this helps!! And remember, the Game is Forever!",1059955200,3,1391,4.523809523809524
7963349,4,B000067J4O,"Hey they didn't charge 30 bucks for this DVD. It's under 12 bucks in most DVD stores (The price of a pizza!). It's the titan tron entrance videos that you see when you go to a WWE event. (Been to 14 of them). If your a real WWE fan, you'll enjoy having these clips on DVD, especially if you've got a good sound system (I've got Klipsch Pro-Media 5.1's and just about EVERYTHING sounds amazing). This DVD is meant to be played loud, and on occasion when your bored. It's not meant to captivate you.
Sure a few extra's would have been nice, but I'm sure volume 2 will be an improvement, maybe having 15 videos or something. Looks to me like another tradition similar to WWE the music.
IF your a fan, buy it at local store and save the shipping charge. Not a bad DVD for the price.",1039219200,,778,4.193333333333333
7963350,4,B000067J4O,"Although a little short (under a half hour in length), this was a great release idea.  Excellent music videos played to the wrestlers' entrance themes, this could also be seen as a teaser to Anthology (available now) with a few of the themes not available before this DVDs release.
The audio is a little low and not astounding even on a great sound system, but everything else comes across great.  Some real extras would have been nice, too, but you can't have everything I guess.
Hopefully they will make another RAMPED UP in the near future.  I'll be looking forward to it.",1037577600,,575,4.617647058823529

7963352,4,B000067J4O,"I was excited when I heard about this release. I read the reviews here on Amazon and was unsure whether or not I want to buy this. I bought it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. You really have to be a WWE fan to enjoy this...and I consider myself a huge fan. I love the media they release, such as the WWE: The Music CDs. I cannot wait for Anthology and that is what makes this DVD special. It will hold me over until Anthology comes out. As for the quality of the DVD...it is great. You get ""almost"" all of the new versions of the theme music...such as The Rock, Jericho, Undertaker, etc. By ""new"" I mean the versions that are not on CD yet. For example, both The Rock's music and Jericho's music are slightly different from what has previosuly been released. Anyway, the point is, this is great if you enjoy the CDs...now you have videos to go along with them. I just wish there were more to watch on this DVD.  This  seems like a test release...almost as if Vince is trying to see if we are willing to buy music videos.",1034985600,,1025,4.224489795918367
