8177045,4,B000NDENOS,"This coach knows her stuff. The drills were helpful with preparing my daughter's fundamental skills for little league girls (11-12 years old) fast pitch softball tryouts. I do wish the tape devoted more instruction for beginning pitching drills. But pitcher is a complicated position. And learning how to make the right defensive/offensive play requires strategic wisdom gained through playing a number of games over time, listening to coaches and teammates and paying attention to the referees. I can recommend this video for parents who want to get involved with helping their daughters learn how to play the game of fast pitch softball. (Those parents who coach softball will want to read books on the subject as well.) Watch the video together. Then buy a bucket of practice balls of the correct size and a couple of good aluminum bats and take her to the electric batting cages to help boost her confidence. Practice throwing and catching on the run, just as Stacy Iveson recommends. Try all her drills. Practice catching grounders and fly balls while pretending you have a base runner to develop fielding skills and strategies. Train her to anticipate the various ways a play may occur and what her reactions should be for each possibility...You'll be surprised how much she will improve over a season. It's also interesting to observe the coach/player relationship Coach Iveson has cultivated with her players who participated in her video.",1422662400,,1447,5.109704641350211
