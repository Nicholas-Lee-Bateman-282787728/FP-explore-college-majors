8304182,4,B001G78GUC,"I have a close relative who, not so long ago, was diagnosed with diabetes. Sometimes understanding such a complex disease and what it is about can be very challenging for individuals with little or no scientific knowledge. I found this video very straight forward and very simple to understand. It bases it s content on the basics of Diabetes taking away some of the ""scary"" learning process by using colorful and clear images. It encourages to ask the Doctor for further assistance and guidance.",1235606400,2,496,4.916666666666667
8304183,1,B001G78GUC,"Having just been diagnosed with diabetes, I was looking for a quick and easy tool to help me understand how the disease works and how to cope with it.  I thought a simplistic approach might work best for me, so when I saw this animated DVD I grabbed it.  My mistake!
I wish I had looked at how long it was, because that would have told me everything about this DVD that I needed to know - it's all of 13 somewhat-informed minutes, including some ridiculously long pauses between scenes (terrible editing, probably on purpose so the film would play longer!).  The information provided is helpful, but incredibly sketchy to say the least!  There are no additional features, tips on food choices or any other assistance on how to actively deal with diabetes.
For someone looking for a DVD to help them explain this disease, look elsewhere!",1235001600,3,836,4.666666666666667
