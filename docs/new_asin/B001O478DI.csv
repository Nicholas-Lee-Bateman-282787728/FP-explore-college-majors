8329458,4,B001O478DI,"Character actor Oscar Holmolka gets a star turn this time around as a kind antique shopkeeper whose past as a Devil's Island prisoner comes back to haunt him when his assistant blackmails him for huge amounts of money and an arranged marriage to his daughter, a classic concert violinist. He will do anything to prevent his daughter from discovering his past, even murder. Film has quite a few surprising twists and turns, suspensefully acted, with about a five minute show stealing wiggle walk from Diana Dors as the blackmailer's girlfriend, minus her platinum blonde hair. She was not in the credits, but crowds of her admirers came to see the film because she had a part in it.",1315958400,2,681,4.779661016949152
