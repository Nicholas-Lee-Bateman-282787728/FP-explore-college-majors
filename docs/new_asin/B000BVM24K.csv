2443451,2,B000BVM24K,"come on. the reviews for this movie are seriously disturbing. You cannot judge a movie just because of the biceps or just because it has a sweet happy ending. Honestly, there is no artistic merit in this film at all. The storyline is very contrived, as if it were a fairy tale or a fantasy of getting it on with your best friend who was in the army. Also, there is way too much crying and tragedy in the film and thirdly, I know the film has a low budget but look at ""Ethan Mao""! It too has a low budget but is more compelling. The scenes in Regarding Billy look like they are snapshots of some lousy karaoke mtvs. all in all, not the best indie gay film i have come across.",1148428800,4,674,4.075187969924812
2443452,4,B000BVM24K,"This is a sweet and touching little movie. I rented it not knowing what to expect. I honestly expected to be disappointed since there are so many really bad gay themed movies out on the market, but what a pleasant suprise...this one is a winner.

Billy (Ronnie Kerr)has to return back home to look after his younger brother Johnny (Jack Sway). Billy's best friend from childhood Dean (Jason Van Eman) returns from the Iraq war after receiving an head injury. Both Billy and Dean have deep feelings for each other but have no idea how to let the other know. Both men believe that the other is straight and are therefore affraid to let their feelings be known. What unfolds over the next hour and fifteen minutes of play is a story of commitment, love and understanding between family and best friends. I was really touched and suprised at how lovely this movie really was. Both men are very attractive, especially Jason Van Eman who plays Dean, I couldn't take my eyes off his beautiful face and that smile just melts your hearts. The acting from both Jason Van Eman and Rhonnie Kerr was very good. Making the most of their environment on what was a meager $20,000 budget, the guys did the best they could. And the chemistry between the two men was amazing. I sensed that on screen bond which many gay screen couples lack. I had no doubt of the love and phyical attraction they felt for one another. The kisses shared between the two men was also beautiful. I would love to see these two guys star together again in a movie with a larger budget and higher production values.

I now own Regarding Billy and have since watched it many times. I highly recommend this sweet and touching little love story. If you're having a down day just pop it in your DVD player and it will brighten your feelings and leave you with a smile.",1145923200,33,1822,4.501510574018127
2443453,4,B000BVM24K,"If you want to experience a ""feel good"" love story, especially around Christmastime, then you need to see ""Regarding Billy."" The principal character, Billy, played by Ronnie Kerr, is a truly believable--and loveable--person who always puts the needs of others before his own, as seen in his unselfish love toward his mentally challenged brother, Johnny, played by Jack Sway, after the death of their parents. Billy's unspoken and unexpressed love for his boyhood friend Dean, played by Jason Van Eman, brings just the right amount of tension to the storyline to keep everything interesting. And, of course, we are rewarded with a great ending when Billy summons his courage to tell Dean how he truly feels about him, and discovers that Dean feels the same way. Yes, indeed, it's always great to see the good guys win every now and then. If you're a hopeless romantic at heart, then check out ""Regarding Billy."" You won't be disappointed.",1144540800,16,937,4.974522292993631
2443454,4,B000BVM24K,"Yes, it has flaws - a little talky, a little heavy on the crying - but at the core of this film is a sweetness and a sincerity that is hard for even the most jaded among us to resist completely.

While it's no Brokeback Mountain, the acting is decent enough (the eyes on Mr. Kerr are quite distracting) and the story easy enough to relate to.  I applaud filmmakers who are trying to take gay cinema more into the real and the relevant; not every film has to have a diva soundtrack, a throng of muscle clones or a revalation about what it means to be gay.  Ultimately, our lives, our hopes and our fears are the same - love, loss, family and the pursuit of happiness.  While it doesn't dive deep into any of these topics, it touches on them just enough to make the 71-minutes journey well worth the investment, and one you may want to repeat from time to time, whenever you need a reminder that it's the little things - and those closest to us - that hold the keys to happiness in life.. everything else is icing.",1141084800,32,1012,4.227979274611399
2443455,4,B000BVM24K,"Jeff London (The Last Year, And Then Came Summer) is a writer and director who takes on some tough subject matter about the ordinary men in gay life and fashions simple stories that, while not earth shattering, are delicate reminders of the non-sensational aspects of coming to grips with sexuality. In REGARDING BILLY, his best film to date, he has assembled a small cast of fine young actors (only three), and offers a film that for a $[...]. budget and two weeks of shooting time shows how sensitive little movies can be.

Opening inside a tent on a camping trip, we meet Billy (Ronnie Kerr) and Dean (Jason Van Eman) who have been best friends since childhood. Dean announces he has joined the military to address his life stance (his parents are long gone) and will be going to Iraq. Billy is obviously sad and both young men begin to tell each other something...'but it can wait until morning'. In the next scene Billy is seen with his mentally challenged sweet kid brother Johnny (Jack Sway) as they have returned from the funeral of their parents who have died in an accident. Billy comforts Johnny and moves back to the home he had left to care for his brother. While Dean is in Iraq he writes Billy and Billy fantasizes about Dean's returning home. When indeed Dean does come back from his tour of duty, injured irreparably in the war, Billy insists that Dean move in with the brothers. Despite the obvious new happiness of the three young men living together, there remains an underlying tension between Billy and Dean, a tension broken only by a moment of confession regarding feelings that is one of the more tender 'coming out' scenes yet filmed. The film ends as quietly as it begins with the power of love and extended family as the theme.

All three of the actors perform well despite a script that calls for excessive crying. Kerr and Van Eman are understated hunks that make the attraction and resolution of the plot completely credible. Yes, there are some awkward lines and shaky moments in the film, but the overall effect is one of a loving product that dares to be sentimental in the face of criticism because the creators obviously believe in the story. REGARDING BILLY is a refreshing change from the usual over the top gay films, a film more about core people than the peripheral characters usually in focus. Recommended.

2443456,4,B000BVM24K,"i was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  it came in the mail yesterday and have watched it three times since.  for the life of me i couldn't understand what was going on the that dark tent.  i suppose it was dark since i think they were trying to give the illusion that these two guys were a bit younger than in the rest of the movie.  i didn't care much for jack sway who played the so-called mentally challenged younger brother.  the other two guys were very easy to look at and were sincere, even with all the crying by ronnie kerr. this movie is listed on the jacket as 80 minutes long but havea feeling that included the credits.  i would have liked this movie better had they added another 15-30 minutes to it.  was quite surprised when it ended.  i really do recommend this movie, if for nothing more than ronnie kerr and jason van eman.  both are beautiful youngsters and seem to be able to act, which is certainly refreshing.  i tried to visit guardian pictures web site but they wanted me to download some program just to watch it.  i de-cided not to since you never know about some of these programs.  i still feel that the extras at the end of some of these films are the best parts of them.  even if this one is very short, watch it.  i really enjoyed it.

2443457,4,B000BVM24K,"Only 71 minutes long, this sweet little film has an engaging ensemble of three actors and a sympathetic musical score.  Ronnie Kerr is perfect as Billy.  He is genuine, childlike, honest, handsome, wistful, and well-built, with remarkably expressive eyes.  Dean, his long-time best friend, announces unexpectedly that he has enlisted, and abruptly leaves home.  Jason Van Eman plays Dean in a warm, forthright manner, and the two good-looking leads have a nice, playful - but very frustrating - friendship.  Incapable of articulating their feelings, Dean departs with much left unsaid.

By the time the injured Dean returns, Billy is caring for his learning-disabled younger brother, and the story really begins.  The three young men learn to become a family and, though each has a handicap to deal with, their unerring love pre-ordains the powerful and intimate conclusion.

The film has its faults, to be sure, which would be more bothersome in a less engaging film.  There is a lot of crying, for example, but the actors themselves laugh about this excess in the commentary track.  On a purely physical level, one could wish for Billy to take his shirt off at least once, considering the look of his arms and chest in his tight T-shirt!

But the sincerity, skill, and earnestness of the actors overrides any flaws.  This is a highly personal statement by writer/director Jeff London and his quietly seductive cast.",1138579200,44,1417,5.060344827586207
2443458,3,B000BVM24K,"In the indie drama ""Regarding Billy"" (2005), 20-something Billy (Ronnie Kerr) returns home after his parents are killed in an accident, in order to care for his mildly-retarded younger brother, Johnny (Jack Sway), who was devastated by their deaths.  A short time later, they also take in Dean (Jason Van Eman), Billy's best friend from childhood, who recently returned wounded from a tour of duty in Iraq.  As they share a home, Billy realizes that he has not outgrown his boyhood attraction to the hunky Dean, and agonizes over telling him about his feelings.  Meanwhile, Dean is worried about becoming a burden to the boys.

Without giving away the entire story, that's about all I can possibly tell you about this thinly-plotted film, which is about as predictable as a tic-tac-toe game.  Filmed on a tiny $20,000 budget in just over a week, writer/director/producer Jeff London does a passable job, despite some overly dramatic ""fade"" shots, some dialogue that's so syrupy sweet it can cause tooth decay, and a cast that tends to overacting and drawing out every one of the many emotional scenes in the story.  To his credit, he used ordinary-looking actors with whom the gay ""everyman"" can identify, rather than the usual A&F clones that seem to populate most gay cinema.  The teen who plays Johnny does a good job with a difficult role, and Van Eman makes a convincing military veteran (Liner notes say he also had an uncredited role in ""Jarhead"").

DVD Extras include deleted scenes and (in a reprise of the final scene in the film) the cast gathered together for a reading of ""Twas The Night Before Chirstmas.""  There is also supposed to be a commentary track, but it did not work on the DVD I bought.  I give the film 3 stars out of 5.",1137110400,4,1745,4.729372937293729

2443460,3,B000BVM24K,In Gay Literature and Film there are several recurrent themes. Theres coming of age and realizing Im gay and knowing Im gay and fearing to come out to my parents and friends. Both seem to have been done to death from every possible angle. This three-hander tells of two best friends both gay who are fearful to come out to each other for fear of what it could do to their friendship if the feelings are unrequited. The adult leads are not experienced actors but their love for each other and chemistry rings true. The third character is Billys younger mentally challenged brother whom he adopts when their parents are killed in an unspecified accident. This film was produced by minimal crew and the often overly bright lighting suggests that their equipment didn't allow for mood lighting. This isn't great theatre but it was an act of love.,1410825600,3,842,4.695945945945946
2443461,5,B000BVM24K,"I seem to have developed an uncanny sense that tells me when to take negative reviews with a grain of salt, and I'm so glad I did so in this case.  To criticize this movie would be like trying to find fault with a newborn baby or a magical sunset.

I was moved beyond my tears to a special place where I felt warm, uplifted, and happy.  The filmmakers didn't have to assault my senses with a barrage of ""F"" bombs or gratuitous nudity and sex scenes--nor did they see any need to incorporate any distracting or annoying peripheral characters to disturb my focus on the leads and the evolving love story.

Here we see just 3 average wonderful young men--- 2 masculine, handsome adults and a young mentally challenged little brother with a tenderness for each other that drew me to them instantly and made me wish the movie was twice as long as it actually is.

The acting, dialogue, and cinematography are all to my liking.  Never once do any of the 3 male leads say anything sarcastic, hurtful or mean spirited to each other.  Nothing else is needed but the wonderful chemistry between them.  This is most often why I watch movies--- to be entertained and uplifted.  I don't need every film to be vulgar, profane, shocking, disturbing, or frightening to hold my attention.  In my world, thankfully, there will always be a yearning for simplistic beauty, tenderness, and warm happy endings.

Kudos to all involved in this wonderful little gem!  I'm so happy I found and purchased this movie,  and I will enjoy watching it many more times.",1376438400,4,1536,4.602941176470588

2443464,5,B000BVM24K,"I just watched this film and to response to the negative reviews:

1.  For me the plot was not thin at all.  Sure I knew the characters were going  to get together, but so what?  I found myself rooting for them and knew the secret would be revealed at the right time.
2.  This film did not need a bigger budget.  It was intimate, warm, and the camera work and cinimatography splendid.
3.  The acting was excellent.  The two leads were totally believable and I felt the characters bond from the very beginning of the film.
4.  I did not feel there were too many weepy moments.  These were pretty strong themes and emotions the characters were going through, and I felt their pain and joy.
5.  I do have to agree about one point.  I was sure after the confession they would be making love in front of the fireplace. But they just held on to each other devulging more sweet sentiment.  That is still alright with me.

As far as gay themed love story films, I have to rate this one up there with Shelter, Beautiful Thing, and Big Eden.  It made me feel good.  Their was not one gay stereotype in the whole film.  For that I give it 5 stars alone.  It was about real people in real situations.  Highly recommended.",1326585600,2,1209,4.288888888888889
2443465,1,B000BVM24K,"After reading the story line for this film, but not first reading any review, I bought this movie. After watching it I'm very sorry I did.

Although the plot was an interesting one, there were many problems with this film. First off the casting. The main two actors looked as if they were about 35 years old. This story would have been told much better by actors that were much younger. I mean the main premise is that there are two best friends and one of them decides to join the military. I mean how many 35 year olds' join the military?

Another main problem with this film was the acting. It was pretty abysmal! The acting by the guy who played the mentally challenged brother was pretty good, but the acting of the two main characters was awful!

The writing of the script and screen play was also really bad. The poor acting and the poor writing combined to make the characters completely unbelievable. There was absolutely NO chemistry between them.

The direction and production wasn't that great either... It seemed copied and forced at times. cliche at others. It was like lets do the same camera angles and pans that famous film directors do... and there was one supposedly forced heartfelt scene where the music began a bit late and then the obligatory fade out happened... it was so bad!

This could have been a really good movie. If it had had better writing, better casting, better acting and better direction it would have been. Skip this movie! It is not worth the money nor your time.",1313884800,,1503,4.5724907063197024
2443466,4,B000BVM24K,"Because I am a romantic, I always enjoy Jeff London films.  This is a small sweet film about two friends who learn to take a chance and love one another.  The ending takes place at Christmas and so I watched it again this week as a Christmas present to myself.  I am glad I bought the DVD so I could watch it every year.  Even though it is an independent film with several flaws, I recommend it highly.",1292371200,2,402,4.115384615384615
2443467,4,B000BVM24K,"Hmm.  I wasn't really expecting anything spectacular, and this wasn't...but I was kinda half-expecting something awful, and it definitely wasn't that either.

Let's see.  The other reviewers have pretty much hit the flaws.  It's awfully short, it's kinda unpolished, it's supremely predictable, and I smiled at one review where the reviewer mentioned what a pity it was that Ronnie Kerr didn't so much as take his shirt off (and got a nasty comment for it, but the reviewer had it right...whoo-boy).

But the flaws are all pretty easy to overlook.  Now let's face it - most gay movies out there are pretty bad.  The marginal ones get watched over and over again because, really, they're as good as we're gonna get.  Truthfully, this was a sweet, sad-ish, but still very heartwarming story.  Yes, it was predictable, but we all could have predicted the plot just by reading the summary blurb before buying it.  It was a little on the weepy side, but I guess I make allowances for a couple of young men who've gone through some rotten experiences with no one else to talk to; I'd probably be weepy, too.  I do wish it had been a little longer - the story could have been fleshed out a little more, and maybe a little more angst added (or maybe that last is just my general irritation with people more well-adjusted than I).

The negatives are pretty minor, in my opinion.  Ultimately, it's a sweet little film that I'm not sorry to have watched.",1257984000,7,1443,4.633858267716535

2443471,3,B000BVM24K,"This is a sweet ""predictable"" short gay romance. From the first scene where these two guys are inside a tent we know that they are in love with each other. But like most buddies relationships, guys behave in a very straight old fashioned way. Even if one of the buddies is gay, his feelings are very much hidden and never shared with the other. Many gay coming out movies seem to dwell on this theme.

Ronnie Kerr plays Billy, the wholesome cute boy; Jack Sway, plays very convincingly Johnny, Billy's mentally retarded brother; and Jason Van Eman, plays Dean, the masculine tough guy who goes off to the military (I am guessing because he does not want to confront his feelings for Billy).

Billy and Johnny's parents died and Dean returns from the military who moves in with them. Dean is going blind due to an injury in the battlefield.

Regarding Billy is unique in that both guys are gay, have feelings for each other, and act as straight guys. The movie ends with both, Billy and Dean telling each other the truth about each other. There is one kissing scene, some hugging and that is it. The only nakedness is Dean's tight, and well formed chest. Director Jeff London must be very conscientious about nudity.

Unfortunately the gay part is very short. There are some outtakes and movie commentary in the special features section.",1198972800,3,1336,4.672340425531915

2443473,4,B000BVM24K,"I've been watching a fair number of independent gay-themed films over the past few months (those with a very low---or NO---budget), just to see what all is out there. Quite honestly, a lot of them really are not very good. But I have to say that I enjoyed ""Regarding Billy"" more so than about 80% of the similarly-themed independent films I've seen.

Oh, no doubt about it, this is a sentimental tear-jerker sort of story. Think of a very small-scale Lifetime made-for-television film, with a gay twist. But hey, I tend to be a sentimental kind of guy, and sometimes I really am in the mood for just such a picture. And this one fit the bill admirably. It's not perfect, but it really did engage me on an emotional level.

I do wish that the relationship between the two leads was explored in more depth; they were an appealing couple and had great chemistry together, and I simply wanted to see more interaction between them. Perhaps that is the greatest drawback of this film; with its modest running time, it seems rather like a sketch of a story---lightly drawn, just waiting to be made into a two-hour feature. There are a lot of interesting ideas here waiting to be more thoroughly explored. But taken on its own modest terms, I can say that I really did enjoy this picture. (I would REALLY have liked to see a bit more snogging between the two leads, however, that is certain! As I said, they were an appealing pair.)

The DVD contains a handful of outtakes, a couple of which are quite funny. And the commentary track, with the director and three actors, is a lot of fun (despite a couple of silent spots early on). It's just those four guys in a room, laughing around and joking and having a good time while talking about the film. (It cracked me up, when they themselves were laughing about how many doe-eyed, teary reaction shots the lead character had to give.) I recommend this one.",1189296000,4,1895,4.535087719298246

The main character keeps crying, his retarded brother keeps saying cutesy twaddle that tugs at the heart strings, and the jock looks cute and uninvolved all through the picture. This stuff went out with Shirley Temple. The hour and ten minutes went by like three hours. The music track was just an exercise in cheap sentiment. Avoid this movie like the plague.

2443476,2,B000BVM24K,"You never know with a gay independent film if you will love it or hate it.  The reviews for this film seem evenly split both ways.  I took a chance and ordered it, assuming that I would either fall into the camp that loved it or side with those who hated it.  I am sorry to report that I belong to the group that utterly loathed it.  In retrospect, if find it odd that nobody seemed to fall in the middle, which causes me to suspect that some of the rave reviews that prompted me to purchase it were planted here by friends of the cast or its creators.  Either that or they are as mentally challenged as the character of Johnny is supposed to be.  Thank goodness I had a dose of insulin at the ready.

[...]I have nothing against low budget - I have seen more than my share of poorly-financed gay films that I genuinely enjoyed.  But I'm afraid that Regarding Billy hit a big ten on my barf meter.  I might have liked it better had it not been so emotionally manipulative.  Shortly into the second scene, the music swells and one of the characters suddenly begins to sniffle, a prelude to the spectacle of watching a grown man burst into tears.  Throughout the entire film, whenever one of the three characters is about to start bawling, we are warned of the coming storm by snatches of bad soundtrack that sound like it's left over from Brian's Song or Love Story.  [...]

Then again, I may have been more satisfied with Regarding Billy had the wafer-thin plot not been drawn out way too much, even for a film that barely ran seventy minutes.  The two lead characters are supposed to be best friends of many years, each concealing and bearing the dreaded secret that he is in love with the other.  When it came time for the big revelation (about sixty-eight minutes overdue), and one of the actors grabbed the other to plant a kiss on his mouth, I frankly thought I was going to puke.  Then again, I may have been more impressed if all three characterizations had not come across as so phony - each appears to be trying to outdo the other two in the ""nice guy"" department, trading sappy lines and oozing charm and good-nature, despite one poorly-written excuse for crocodile tears after another.  ""Gee, Dean, I guess this is about the best Christmas tree light display ever"".  ""Yeah, buddy, it sure is"".  Does anybody think that people really talk like this?  I might have been able to stand the phony sweetness had it been confined to one scene, but each new camera angle seemed to proffer but one of two moods; sickeningly sweet, or melodramatically melancholy.  And each bit of dialogue as phony as the last.

I wasted a very long hour and ten minutes of my life watching Regarding Billy, not to mention about 45 seconds on the overly-sweet, poorly done reading of ""The Night Before Christmas"" included as the special feature - thank goodness I reached for the remote and stopped that one quick, as soon as I felt the bile rising in my stomach.  To give you an idea of this thoughtfully included extra, let's just say that the least able of the three dramatically challenged actors reads the celebrated Clement Clarke Moore poem in its entirety, while the other two look profoundly embarrassed.  This film has now earned its spot as third on my list of the three worst gay movies ever made, falling just after Visions of Sugar Plums (DREADFUL, and possibly the second-worst gay movie ever made) and Ben and Arthur (still #1 on my list of gay films deserving the Ed Wood Award).

Of course, I haven't yet wasted all my resources on badly-written, poorly acted and ineptly directed independent gay vehicles.  So let it suffice to say that Regarding Billy is merely the third worst gay movie that I've seen, and let it go at that.

Rent or purchase Regarding Billy at your own risk.",1179792000,2,3783,4.508797653958944

Now the good:  Wow.  I was really moved by this film.  Now I consider myself The Grinch, but even my heart couldn't bear the weight of the sincerity of this film and the resolve of the characters in it.  It's a study in hope and love and faith in family and each other.

Two boyhood friends, both clearly in love with the other, go their separate ways in adulthood, fearing how the other would feel about their gay feelings.  Through a set of tragic circumstances, both are thrust back together, some time later, along with a mentally challenged sibling, to finally express their love and try to form a family.

This film is definitely not for everybody.  I can understand some viewers' diappointment.  I wasn't disappointed.  If you are interested in family dynamics and appreciate the nuances of gay relationships, and you're not up for the latest mind-numbing blockbuster filled with bullets and special effects, this would be, in my opinion, far more worth your time.

The script is awkardly written, the voices of the characters nearly indistinguishable from each other and the plot slow, searingly boring and not credible at all.  While I hate to criticize the cast, knowing how hard actors work, i would assume the appallingly bad acting is a product of even more appallingly bad directing.

Bad, bad, BAD film. Nobody involved should quit their day job.",1161302400,3,487,4.705882352941177

8093397,5,B000BVM24K,"This was a very low budget film, but it makes up for it in every way with heart.  That doesn't sound like much, but this is one of my favorite films just for the interactions, execution, and relatability.",1456963200,,204,4.368421052631579
8093398,4,B000BVM24K,"Too much weeping and crying and mourning. I think they gave away the store in the first few minutes of the film, when the two guys are camping in a tent.  So gay, before it should have been obvious, for the script.  It is feel good romance, but the two guys are pretty feminine and emote a bit too much, especially Billy's older brother who is straight looking, but oh so feminine and emotional.
Would be better if there was a bit less weeping and nostalgia for mom and dad who apparently died recently.
Billy is probably the best role, he makes the movie work.",1450137600,,561,4.333333333333333

8093401,2,B000BVM24K,The young actor in this does a fine job in a difficult role.  The story is predictable and addresses some serious issues with a little less care and effort than I would have liked.  Any of the sub plots could have been developed into great movies of their own.  It is disappointing that they were treated so casually in preference to the underdeveloped plot that wasn't.,1440806400,,370,4.575757575757576
8093402,5,B000BVM24K,"Touching, loving and intense movie.  The twist is how ""best friends"" is so beautifully defined as ""I love you....and I am IN love with you"".  Really a great movie.  The acting is a bit rough but the kissing scenes and intimate conversations are very believable and well done!",1422576000,,275,4.6875
8093403,5,B000BVM24K,"Regarding Billy is wonderfully written, very well acted and beautifully filmed. I love the sincerity and extraordinary realness of the characters. This film touches the heart. Most gays are just ordinary guys with ordinary jobs from ordinary places from ordinary families. There is an instant connexion with the characters. These are people most of us can identify with. The film is such a positive experience. There will be times viewing it that you will flash back to similar times in your own life. The characters portray emotions and hopes we have all had. This is an exquisite film.",1422230400,,587,5.0

8093405,4,B000BVM24K,"This is a 3 man movie, indie and low budgeted. That doesn't mean it is bad because it isn't. This is well acted by all 3 actors but sometimes the Johnny character seems a little forced. The Dean and Billy actors are both terrific. The story, briefly is Billy and Dean are boyhood friends and you can see the attraction between them but neither says anything and Dean goes off to war. When Dean comes home he stays with Billy and Johnny and the feelings resurface. But there are secrets that need to be brought to light. The bitter sweet ending works because there is real love there. No sex but man to man kissing. I did like it. Short movie though. I have to admit misting up a couple times, too.",1418601600,3,697,4.287878787878788
