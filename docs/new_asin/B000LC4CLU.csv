2702922,2,B000LC4CLU,"Though unrated, it would not be worse than PG-13.  There are stories of 3 children who want to leave their countries to go another.  Each encounters serious problems, and learn that ""the other side"" is not necessarily a good place to go.  Three different accents:  Mexico, Cuba, Spain.  There is no real culmination, or tying together of the three stories, so in that way you are left hanging, but it could be used in an AP class as a springboard for discussion.",1212883200,20,462,4.585365853658536
2702923,5,B000LC4CLU,"This is a poignant, artistic and insightful movie perfect for Spanish classes for a lot of it is in Spanish, but for other classrooms as well.  It delves into the lives of three young children whose fathers have left their countries in search of work or better opportunities and in a candid way shows the pain and desolation of those left behind. It also depicts the lengths that a child will go to in order to be reunited with his/her father.
Sad, but realistically beautiful!",1207526400,38,477,4.6117647058823525
2702924,5,B000LC4CLU,"In these days of demonizing outsiders, this beautifully crafted film reminds the viewer that, at the bottom of it all, we are all human beings with the same hopes, fears, needs and desires.  I wish this film were required viewing for anyone before they offer their opinion on any aspect of the immigration debate.",1198454400,32,313,4.796296296296297
2702925,5,B000LC4CLU,This was a beautifully and artistically done movie on a very current and important topic.  It is objective and thought provoking. The acting and on site filming is superb. I caution parents with young children to screen it before showing it. It has some very strong content. The images and situations haunt you for days.,1192060800,26,320,4.818181818181818
2702926,5,B000LC4CLU,"This was a touching movie about three children one from Mexico, Middle East and Cuba. How they went about wanting to try and be with there father who was in another Country trying to make money for a better life for his family. I recommend seeing this touching movie.",1175731200,16,267,4.469387755102041
2702937,4,B000LC4CLU,"March 15, 2011. I believe other reviewers have had some very cogent things to say about this movie, and I find merit in most if not all of the reviews. I watched this movie for a Spanish Club I belong to, wherein we try to improve or at least maintain our abilities to speak Spanish. I picked the movie thinking that the group wanted something with a little weight but not too intense. I also wanted something by Mexican film makers.  I think this movie fills the bill. It is mostly pleasant and interesting whether or not you want to work on Spanish. There is some beautiful scenery, I thought especially in the Moroccan/Spanish story. The three segments do all treat the theme of fathers who have gone across borders to seek better lives and the yearning of children they've left behind for them. I don't think there are profound insights beyond that. The Mexican story has a touch of magical realism, and the Cuban section some sadness.

The Moroccan/Spanish segment is probably the best from a critical point of view, as another reviewer mentioned. It is also the most gritty. That section and the brief allusion to prostitution in the Cuban section are probably the parts that would give pause to parents considering it for preteen children.

I thought one weakness from a critical point of view was that the children were almost too sweet and their journeys not entirely believable. At the same time, it has the more gritty elements in the Moroccan/Spanish story, so there are problems with it for younger children as well as different problems for adults looking for a realistic treatment of the important themes it raises. Also, putting three stories in a rather short film results in too little time for significant character development.",1300147200,3,1747,4.79734219269103
2702938,5,B000LC4CLU,"Good family movie, in English and Spanish, I teach Spanish and my students love this movie. It is a tear jerker, and very well done, while addressing immigration from a different perspective",1289433600,,190,4.96875
2702939,5,B000LC4CLU,"This touching film compares and contrasts the parallel lives of three children in different parts of the world who are all struggling with the absence of their fathers, who have emigrated ""to the other side"" to find work.

I teach Spanish and I showed this film to my students with great results. They get the benefit of hearing spoken Spanish with three distinct regional accents (rural Mexico, Cuba, Spain), and the subtitles are done very well (they can also be turned off). Some of my students were disappointed that the stories didn't have happily-ever-after endings, but that opened up into good discussions about some of the social issues that arise in the childrens' lives. The film is subtle and tasteful in its treatment of social issues surrounding emigration and poverty. Most of my students live comfortably sheltered, and after watching this film we were able to have meaningful discussions about how they could and could not relate to the children in the film. If you'll be showing this to young people, be aware that there are two very brief shots of non-sexual nudity (Since I'm in a school setting, I covered up the screen for those moments).

Overall, a wonderful piece! I highly recommend it.",1264550400,3,1212,4.907317073170732

2702941,5,B000LC4CLU,"A realistic film that deals with the struggles of people of developing countries and their search for better opportunities. Entirely in Spanish, intended for a Spanish speaking audience.",1247097600,,186,5.678571428571429
2702942,1,B000LC4CLU,This movie is not appropriate for a Spanish classroom. There is a scene in which a woman gets out of the bed and uses the bathroom with the door open. This is not appropriate for a school setting. The plot was also not very interesting.,1246406400,6,236,4.266666666666667
2702943,4,B000LC4CLU,"Recommended, especially for those who know or are learning Spanish. The section on the young girl from North Africa who travels to Spain to find her father is especially good.",1242777600,,175,4.866666666666666

2702945,4,B000LC4CLU,"I like movies that are real life experiences, that could really happen. This is that kind of movie. I like to see how other people live their lives, how they deal with their circumstances. It helps you empathize with other people whose lives are faced with obstacles & challenges that we probably will never face. This is a good movie.",1224460800,5,335,4.6

8161099,5,B000LC4CLU,So glad I found this DVD; I lost my other copy; it's a superb rendition of those faceless family members who are invisible in the plight of global immigration. Would highly recommend,1504569600,,182,4.71875
8161100,4,B000LC4CLU,"Great movie to show for an AP Spanish class.  The only downfall is that there are no Spanish subtitles...only English.
Some parts are in Arabic so you need some form of subtitles.
I wish they had Spanish titles. Excellent for themes about immigration. (Cuba, Mexico, Spain/Morroco)",1419984000,,281,5.108695652173913

8161104,5,B000LC4CLU,3 great stories. Watched this as part of a Spanish/Moroccan immigration literature course and thought it fit great.  Will show to my high school Spanish classes as part of an immigration unit (Spanish 3 and 4).,1409616000,,210,4.833333333333333
8161105,3,B000LC4CLU,"This is not a film, but three vignettes woven together unnecessarily. Each Vignette should be a separate feature film, as the stories are not connected in any way, and this would allow for each character and story to be fleshed out properly. In particular, the story of the girl from Marrakesh has a great deal of unrealised potential. The acting, on the whole, is good, and this is worth collectors' attention, if only for the number of appearances by known faces of Hispanic cinema.",1391126400,,484,4.773809523809524
8161106,5,B000LC4CLU,Simply perfect ... very educational... I bought the DVD  for Spanisch lessons in school - and this film is very helpful for teaching on the immigration subject,1379030400,,159,4.888888888888889
8161107,4,B000LC4CLU,"My dad had me watch this movie and it was beautifully done. He warned me that it was a bit sad and that is the absolute truth, it is a very sad movie. My only real critique is that the ending is so open-ended and it felt too abrupt. Other than that, this movie has beautifully told stories from these kids perspectives.",1318809600,,319,4.161290322580645
8161108,5,B000LC4CLU,I purchased this movie to show during the immigration unit in an upper level Spanish class. It hits on illegal immigration into the U.S. from Mexico & Cuba as well as from the continent of Africa into Spain. Good variety.,1313193600,3,221,4.55
