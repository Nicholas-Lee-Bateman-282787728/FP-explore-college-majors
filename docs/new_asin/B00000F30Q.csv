1200568,4,B00000F30Q,This TV movie is more about the personal lives of Frank and Jesse James so don't expect too many shoot outs. This is a very interesting look into the lives of the characters and that's what I like about this type of Western movie. Kris and Johnny are both very good in their roles. I can't believe June played their mother!,1076284800,2,323,4.311475409836065
1200569,4,B00000F30Q,"The Ballad of Jesse James was one of the most popular songs of the 19th century. Johnny Cash once noted that fact saying that his songs of violence and crime came from that same American traditon. Frank and Jesse James were ""America's Robin Hoods"" and Cash and Kristofferson have wonderful chemistry as the outlaw brothers in The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James. If you don't like 80's TV movies, or if you could care less about Frank and Jesse James, this may not be for you. Otherwise, this is one of the most accurate films about the James brothers ever made. There's a little fancy and folklore thrown into the mix, but James devotees wanting a realistic depiction should be very pleased with this movie.",1075075200,3,711,4.606299212598425
1200570,2,B00000F30Q,"I've watched this movie twice (I'm that big of a fan of Cash), and the Last Days is still only marginal. The acting is not convincing, though it is endearing, nor is the story very compelling. The movie seems to justify two men whose actions were quite ignoble, no matter how one views the outcome of the Civil War.",1070236800,3,315,4.3559322033898304
1200571,2,B00000F30Q,"As a western lover I was quite disappointed by the film itself.
It's very poorly directed and the editing is terrible. It's only interest lies in the cast, but then again, they've all done much better stuff.",1067126400,3,207,4.621621621621622
1200572,5,B00000F30Q,"I first recorded this on BETA tape and I wore it out over the years. I later bought a VHS copy, so you know I loved it. I'd take into account I'm a diehard fan of Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson and Outlaw Country. I found the acting well executed (this is a cast of country music artists, only June Carter Cash had studied acting, yet they performed superbly.) Johnny Cash plays Frank James very convincingly and Kris Kristofferson is a sexy, sulky Jesse James. Notable is a small cameo by David Allan Coe who steals the scene and June Carter Cash's memorable portrayal of Zelda James, the James' mother. If you're a fan of the highwaymen or country music you'll likely enjoy this movie. Outlaws playing outlaws, how can you find fault? Look for Willie Nelson as General Joe Shelby and a cameo by Ed Bruce. Country outlaw Waylon Jennings is the only Highwayman absent in this gem of a western.",1054252800,7,909,4.58282208588957

1200585,3,B00000F30Q,"The Last Days of Frank & Jesse James, 1992 film

This begins in 1882 St. Joseph Missouri. A man shot Jesse James! People grab souvenirs. Jesse and Frank rode with Quantrells Raiders. They show scenes of rural life. Frank works his farm with two mules. In town men talk about the Tilden-Hayes election of 1876. They show a card game in town. The gang robs a bank, then flees from the gunfire of the citizens. [No Gun Control then.] The Pinkertons get close but they get away. The Governor of Missouri gets funds from the railroads and express companies (the victims of robberies). They visit Uncle George and his young wife in Kentucky. Frank explains why he must be ever on his guard; he just wants a peaceful life. They show a horse race.

There is a shooting exhibition to raise funds for the fire brigade. Jesse shows his skill with a revolver. Too good for a farmer? The Governor of Missouri offered a deal to the James Boys: surrender and get a plea deal. Do they trust him? Jesse doesnt. Tom Hill acts up in a tavern, then is overpowered and captured. He is offered $10,000 and freedom to betray the James Gang. Frank will go to Sedalia to talk to Major Anderson about that deal. The James Gang rob a train and kill the conductor. Frank doesnt want to continue the outlaw life. Elsewhere there is personal conflict and a shooting. Jesses favorite cousin is dead! What does Governor Crittenden have to offer? Robbers spent their money on gambling, liquor, and women.

Dick Little surrendered. The Ford brothers are alone with Jesse James. I just shot Jesse James! Former soldiers visit the grave. Bob Ford tells about the shooting to paying customers. Charlie Ford plays the part of Jesse James. [Could this act be popular today?] Will the shooting of Jesse affect Franks trial? The trial is a media event. General Shelby testifies, he regrets his past actions. Dick Little tells about the shooting of the conductor. Frank James is acquitted. Ten years later Bob Ford owns a saloon in Colorado, the Omaha Club. Frank travels there. A man has a grudge against Bob Ford, there is another shooting. Later Frank joined Cole Younger in a Wild West Show. Frank died peacefully at home in 1915.

You can compare this movie to the 1939 movie The Return of Frank and Jesse James for its outlook. This seems more realistic and restrained, and less dramatic. One book said some of the stories about the James Gang were similar to the stories of Robin Hood from centuries ago. If people are oppressed does this make them sympathetic to outlaws? Could this explain some of the unrest of today, such as the 1992 Watts riot? Any bank robbery removes cash from an area and adversely affects local commerce. There was no FDIC to insure depositors, the stolen cash came from local residents. The James Gang never robbed local banks. One false note is the use of paper money exclusively; most people preferred specie, cold cash, over notes. [In The Searchers one character has a bag of newly minted double eagles to suggest he was a bank robber.] People complained about the movie Bonnie and Clyde for glorifying these robbers and killers. How was that different from this movie?",1430524800,,3165,4.6768402154398565

1200587,5,B00000F30Q,"This movie is, in a word, classic!  Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristoferson, and Waylon Jennings all in one movie- just awesome! Historical accuracy may or may not be questionable, but one thing that's not questionable is the entertainment value of this film! It's just fun to watch, especially if you like western-style movies.",1420156800,,334,5.185185185185185
1200588,5,B00000F30Q,"Johnny Cash who is not known as an actor, but as a super-star country singer, play a great job in the portraying of Jesse James.

1200606,5,B00000F30Q,Great movie. I bought this one for a gift. A must for anyone who loves westerns.,1258329600,,80,4.0625
1200607,4,B00000F30Q,"This movie was entertaining.  I am not sure how accurate it is, though.  I was told that Jesse was shot in the back.  In this movie he was shot in the back of the head.  If they are going to get a major detail like this wrong, how well will they document the small details?

Mr. Johnny Cash did a convincing job as Frank, the educated book reading brother, who liked to swear at his mules.  Mr. Kris Kristofferson was fun to watch as the rebel who liked excitement, Jesse.  Mrs. June Carter Cash was a delight and a real surprise in the role of their mother.  There is something comforting in her mannerisms, that I just can not pinpoint or explain.  Mr. Willie Nelson played an important role as a former military man (I can not remember his title.) who showed up at the end of the movie, briefly.  His whole time on the screen was no more than a few minutes.  I am surprised that they even put his picture on the box.

This movie has a specific target audience.  It does well to hold their interest.  I'll give it 3.75 stars.",1191888000,,1027,4.22680412371134
1200608,4,B00000F30Q,"The James Gang has emerged as one of the most notorious outlaw gangs in American History. For years, Frank and Jesse James stayed one step ahead of the law, and were never caught.

Country music superstars Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson are the title characters. Both were pioneers in the country music outlaw movement and play their roles with not only charm but a lot of heart as well. I must say that I've always been fans of their music, and this film is one of the best adaptions of the James tale.

We all know how the story ends, and this film takes us about six years before the death of Jesse James and a little while thereafter. Does Frank James get his revenge on the coward that murdered his brother? Just watch and see! Highly Recommended.",1191024000,,756,4.471014492753623
1200609,5,B00000F30Q,We thought the movie very good. Kept every ones attention. It was writen well. It is one of those movies that we will watch alot. We really like the cast that is in the movie. It was put togeater well. And is a ok movie for kids to watch.,1169942400,,238,3.877551020408163
1200610,5,B00000F30Q,"This one should please Frank and Jesse James buffs who have longed to see a movie with various elements of James history and folklore that have been ignored in other films. Frank was a Southern Christian gentleman and student of the Bard and also a thief and killer. Cash does a fine job capturing his contradictions. Johnny, who can convey intelligence, heart, spirtuality and just as believably sing about killing a man just to watch him die, is brilliant here. Kristofferson is also superb as Jesse. Just as impressive are June Carter Cash, Willie Nelson, and David Allan Coe. Sadly Willie's part is only a cameo, but it's pure gold. A fine movie that is sure to entertain fans of the cast, folks who love a good Western, and Frank & Jesse James enthusiasts.",1115596800,3,761,4.686567164179104
1200611,5,B00000F30Q,"Outstanding entertainment!  One would think with all the musicians who star and have a part in this production, there would be some show of their tallent, but Johnny Cash, as Frank James actually struggles through ""The Old Wooden Cross"" as if he can't carry a tune in a bucket!  Now that was precious.",1111190400,2,301,4.660377358490566

7906364,5,B00000F30Q,"A good, if somewhat inaccurate portrayal of the people & events.
Just one little aside. I've read everything I could lay hands on about Jesse, Franks and their lives and nowhere did I ever see any reference to Jesse being illegitimate.
The rest of the story is pretty close....Give or take a lie or two.
Kris, Cash & Willie in a western...What's not to like",1520899200,,357,4.507692307692308

7906370,4,B00000F30Q,"It was pretty truthful about the last days; however, Frank James did not just have one trial. He had I believe three and was found not guilty in all of them. As soon as one finished, he was handcuffed again and put on a train to go to another State in the South. The people of the South would never find the James Boys guilty of anything.  They did not consider them bandits, outlaws or thieves. They were good Southern boys still fighting the Civil War long after it was over. Jesse was also never a womanizer. He greatly loved his wife, Zee and his son, Jesse James, Jr. The boys had been raised by what I would now call a Southern Baptist preacher and they knew The Good Book better than anyone. Frank did have a love of reading books. There were approximately 456 nickel novels written about Jesse and Frank that had no truth to them at all. Frank had buried some gold he honestly found but when he went to get it the land had been plowed and his markers destroyed. It's still down there some place. The cast was outstanding in every way.  Everyone with their spouses were buried on The Old Home land where they were raised. Frank and his wife were cremated. Their original father, split for the gold mines and disappeared. Mrs. James married another Pastor that helped raise her boys. It was the Pinkerton's that blew off her hand and killed her youngest son when they threw a bomb into her house.. She was played by June Carter Cash if you were wondering why she only had one hand.",1487894400,,1487,4.364620938628159

As they filmed, they covered all the streets with dirt and painted the facades of the buildings to fit the late 1800s.  Many locals worked as extras in the film.

This is a great gift for Jesse James fans in Middle Tennessee - and especially Springfield.",1476144000,,438,4.636363636363637
