8055140,5,B00080ZGBK,"I enrolled my 3 year old son in gymnastics.  I bought this video because I wanted him to be able to grasp what gymnastics is all about. At three and four years old, they are learning all the basic skills and safety, but I wanted him to be able to see what the long range goal was...what he would be working toward.  It really worked for him. He enjoys watching the video every few months, and I really believe it made him more comfortable with his gymnastics class. He also learned a lot of terminology, too.  He loves gymnastics, and tells me often that he can't wait to be big enough to work on the 'big kid' equipment.",1317945600,2,621,4.245762711864407
8055141,5,B00080ZGBK,"We love this movie.  My three year old watches it in the car and when we get home tries to duplicate what she's seen in the movie.  Finally, a positive movie about gymnastics.  Very motivational.",1212451200,2,195,4.514285714285714
8055142,5,B00080ZGBK,"This is a great DVD for your young gymnast-to-be! My 8-yr old daughter is a Level 5 gymnast and won the movie ""Stick It"" at the gym's raffle. After previewing it, I decided to NEVER let her see it. It was a terrible movie, and unlike ""Ice Princess"" does nothing positive for the sport. I found this alternative online and she loves watching it. She has seen it about a dozen times and it has even made her more enthusiastic about competing and learning new tricks! The DVD explains the sport really well, and has interviews with different ages and levels of gymnasts. They divide the events up into separate chapters and even have footage of a meet. It's a great alternative to the disgusting ""Stick It.""",1168300800,13,704,4.551181102362205
8055143,5,B00080ZGBK,"My son's attitude towards his gymnastics classes went from ""it's OK"", to ""I LOVE GOING TO CLASS!"" after watching this video a few times.  The young athletes featured range from ages 8 to 15 years old, and talk positively about teamwork and competition. They really reinforce the idea that 'it's cool to be strong'.  The tricks progress from basic moves to very impressive combinations, on the floor, beam, uneven parallel bars, etc.  The music is great.  Even the babysitters love watching this one with him.",1157587200,14,508,4.9411764705882355
