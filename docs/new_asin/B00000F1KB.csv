1211178,2,B00000F1KB,It is hard to write a rating because it wasn't very memorable. I rented it to see Joan Fontaine but it didn't hold my interest.,1392854400,,127,4.12
1211179,2,B00000F1KB,This is a very slow movie with poor humor and poor acting. We didn't make it past the first 30 minutes.,1376438400,,103,3.9523809523809526

They just don't show enjoyable old movies like this on tv any more. A Louis Jourdan gem with a very young Joan Collins in it!",1289606400,5,294,4.327272727272727

1211182,5,B00000F1KB,"This early 1950's rendition of Boccaccio's late Medieval anthology of romantic stories is a special cinematic offering.  While the film does not attempt to convey the literary work's bawdy details and less than idealistic depiction of human nature, it surely delivers a memorable and entertaining movie blessed with beautiful cinematography and excellent acting by the likes of Louis Jourdan, Joan Fontaine, and a young Joan Collins.  The film presents three separate stories utilizing the same cast members and does so successfully thanks to superlative direction.  This movie provides a nostalgic glimpse of cinema in an era when even provocative topics were treated innocently.  Not only does the film create for the viewer a window on the world of European life in the waning decades of the Middle Ages, it also serves as an excellent example of moviemaking and all of its' colorful legacy and inherent challenges in the middle of the 20th century.",1261267200,10,952,5.2026143790849675
1211183,1,B00000F1KB,"This movie really stunk. It must be public domain because all these public domain el cheapo tape companies carried this title and the print was completely out of focus, like a bad bootleg. Even apart from the atrocious quality of the image the film looked mediocre at best and Joan didn't photograph as well in color. Stick with Joan and Louis (Jourdan) in the wonderful black and white classic Letter to an Unknown Woman.

Caveat emptor!",1136419200,7,438,4.7631578947368425

This version I just purchased on DVD also came with an online version I was just able to download onto my iPod!  What a pleasant surprise!  Now I can watch this classic any time and any place I want!",1410998400,,439,3.8876404494382024
