3882394,5,B0029Z8KK6,"What can I say? As fussy as I am about food, these people really know how to create satisfying, delicious dishes. From technique to ingredients and equipment, every detail of the recipes is covered. Some of the recipes may seem a little picky but honestly the food is so good its worth a little extra time in the kitchen. My fiance and his coworkers who cook all exchange ATK magazines and cookbooks and brag about how good the food comes out. ATK has a cult following in his workplace. At Christmas and birthdays he always requests these dvds. I like knowing that any flubs were already smoothed out before I attempted the recipe so I just get the perfect end results, as tough on the waistline as they may be. People rave about dishes we bring to potlucks.",1323043200,2,758,4.5

8358593,4,B0029Z8KK6,"This is my favorite cooking series and I love having the DVD's because they give you access to every recipe on the discs.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that I wasn't really excited about some of the recipes they chose to make - that's just personal taste.  So, if you're family aren't as picky with what they'll eat as mine, you'll probably love it.",1401926400,,367,4.154929577464789

I like that nothing is absurd or trendy.... no stirring TRUFFLE OIL into everything or insisting that EVERY GREEN VEGETABLE IS KALE.  I've pretty much got all the DVDs now, and it is just good to wile away a rainy day making stock and letting them roll!",1366156800,,330,4.222222222222222
8358596,4,B0029Z8KK6,"i enjoy this program and have told my son, who loves to cook, about it. so this was a gift that i thought he would enjoy as he is also very ""scientific"" and this cooking series goes into testing AND explaining the scientific and specifics of cooking, what cut of meats to use, how proteins react and so forth.",1357689600,,309,4.254237288135593
