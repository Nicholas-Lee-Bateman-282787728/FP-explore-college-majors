8040786,1,B0006A5NTC,"The author learned this from a Green Dragon video and his execution is not correct. I would suggest anyone considering this to get the authentic tape made by  Green Dragon Studios.

The author is a video warrior who learned almost exclusively from videos and lacks fundamentals...Be warned!!

This is a really bad representation of the Stone Warrior training.",1474934400,,359,5.155172413793103
8040787,5,B0006A5NTC,Very Good DVD. Well explained and demonstrated. It helped a lot in my training.,1436313600,,79,4.714285714285714
8040788,5,B0006A5NTC,"I have had great gains from this form. It really works the tendons.  This set gives you tourqing strength, something weight lifting cannot. Really tough set but worth the investment. This dvd is a great value. thank you sifu for such a clear and affordable presentation of this set. I have other presentations of this, but with your version I learned something new that wasn't clearly shown in other versions. If you do Chinese martial arts give this a try. It will help give you the power to make your forms work,  word of warning though. You must do internal work to compliment this set. That way you will not get too stiff. This is a great augmentation to any martial art. Remember, the best martial art is the one you practice.",1406851200,,731,4.53030303030303
8040789,4,B0006A5NTC,"This is exactly what I was looking for - a martial arts ""dynamic isotonic workout"" program to supplement my qigong practice. My initial alternatives were the ""Charles Atlas-style"" isometric/isotonic workout programs that are great, but didn't have the martial focus I was looking for. If you're a experienced martial artist - especially in CMA you'll find the instructions clear, concise and easy to follow. The quality of the DVD is good - nothing fancy...highly recommended!",1402272000,,476,5.36
8040790,3,B0006A5NTC,"Provocative title yes.  The green dragon studios is probably the 2nd most controversial subject/school/system next to 18 daoist palms.  What I will add outside of the politics is that you can do the system without tension.  Something is better than nothing.  The thing which defines most of the green dragon sets is the obsession with tension which I don't agree with.  Saving the iron vest form which I have taught from Kwan fu.  I have the iron palm form by Kwan fu too.  Oddly enough its better than the green dragon iron palm video I saw.  The latter was a combination of two tapes and was incomplete.  I heard other things about other tapes by them.  I cant comment unless I see two different teachers teaching the same thing differently.  In this case it was chicoine and john allen.  Whats missing from this is allens drill sargent method of instruction to what always seems to be an imaginary audience of seminar students.  I say this because no one ever seems to cough, talk, drop pencils or anything.  Its like they are mute or perhaps too intimidated to even dare interrupt.  Criticisms of this form are that it can indeed make your arms as hard as rock but at the cost of speed.  What I have to say is that indeed within the set are exercises when done singly or in combination can literally make not just the arms hard as rock, but the whole body.  But we are talking a more esoteric, or legendary or dare I say spiritual side effect.  #1 #3 #4 #7 #9 #19 stand out as the important ones for reasons I really cant get into.  The postures with the arms crossed is called in shaolin ""key lock arts"" and increases physical strengh in a manner which would be hard to convince people with a ""rational mind"".  Other techniques are thrown in, not all are technically geared towards the ""stone body"" effect.  Some might help cool the body.  For the record high blood pressure is called ""liver wind"" in chinese medicine.  People with blood pressure issues should be careful with this set.  Some people teach tension forms to apply tension only after movement.  But i've seen a test on sanchin that said it was no more strenuous than deep knee bends.  Two herbs that will help with hypertension are tibetain mulberry fruit (morus alba) and xia cu cao (prunellia vulgarius).  Both are superior herbs and safe.  When the arms cross in front of the chest you should face magnetic north.  I guess thats all I have to say about this one for now.",1254182400,5,2442,4.524027459954233
8040791,3,B0006A5NTC,"I'm sorry that you were not happy with the production. If the DVD is faulty, please send it to me for a replacement.

No, not filmed in the basement but in a 5,000 sq ft hall where we were hosting the seminar.

Yes, out of breath because the exercises are under full tension and demonstrated at full tension. If you're not out of breath with the exercise, you are not pushing enough.

Iron Vest is the internal set, Stone Warrior is all external. Please visit my site for more details on the complete Chinese Strength & Health Program.

We will refilm this DVD to make the atmosphere more appealing.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,

Thomas Keen

8040792,4,B0006A5NTC,"First of all, this form costs $100 through another organization, so thank you Prof. Keene for presenting this form at a great price.  After sitting on this dvd a couple of years, I returned to it after doing my own Dynamic Tension exercises for a couple months.  Combined with pushups this form offers an incredible strength program for anyone with a love of the classical martial arts.  I'm dedicating the next several months to this (with pushups)as a stand alone strength routine.  Originally I gave a bad review to this dvd, but looking back at what I wrote I can only offer my apologies to the Sifu, and I was incredibly ignorant of Stone Warrior at that time.",1142812800,2,665,4.610169491525424
8040793,4,B0006A5NTC,"Great form of exercise and definitly a challenging form of qigong for the advanced practitioner, martial artist looking for some form of expansion to their training.  The only downside is you will not find any of the internal basis or what have you on about the Stone Warrior or Iron Wire/Thread qigong on the disk, but it is the advanced portion of their system so they probably expect you know about the internal or historical aspects already.",1104105600,5,445,4.779220779220779
