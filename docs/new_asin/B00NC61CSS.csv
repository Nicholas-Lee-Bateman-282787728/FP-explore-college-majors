6637936,5,B00NC61CSS,"One of the best Christmas movies that children should not see.  Probably not great for dates, either.  Perfect to share with a friend whom you have slogged through some crap with (or your family, if they are a little crusty).  A stellar cast avoids all the predictable stuff and spins some real magic.",1456185600,2,301,4.6415094339622645

6637939,4,B00NC61CSS,"The actors in this holiday movie are very good: Joel McHale,Lauren Graham, and Robin Williams.

I think every director and producer in Hollywood wants to have at least one Christmas film in circulation. This does not disappoint. If anything, it may seem dated and a little too tame for the raunchy fare that we are used to seeing around Christmas. On the other hand, it's not Hallmark or Lifetime, so it doesn't fit in a neat category.

Enjoyable, with good production values. I don't think you'll be disappointed watching this.",1455321600,16,528,4.855555555555555

Yes, I have had similar family moments that are represented in this movie but who wants to repeat them?",1512777600,,411,4.54054054054054
6637947,4,B00NC61CSS,Much better than i thought it would be. Probably a new holiday favorite! Finally a dark comedy that isn't too dark and i could possibly share with family. Robin Williams always delivered 100% no matter how awful the movie was that hes featured in lol.

I think I lasted 10 minutes, and in spite of a really good cast, it was just unwatchable. I didn't like the title, for a starter. Maybe I'll try watching it again, and see if it gets better.

6637956,4,B00NC61CSS,"This is a dark comedy. If you don't get that from the get-go, you'll miss out on all the fun! There is Christmas Spirit in a dark and funny manner that you will find in very few places. It's one of Robin Williams' last films and a noteworthy performance and I might've been predisposed to like it. I recently watched it again and it was funnier than I remembered. Family holidays for many are disastrous, a forced obligation that everyone tries and fails to make the best of -- let alone helping a 6-year-old boy and his father who still has his own inner sad and disappointed 6-year-old boy trying to hang on to ""Santa is real"" when everything conspires to interfere with that agenda. And his father, Grandpa is an irascible Scrooge with a port-a-poddy business. There is some poddy mouth, too. There are poignant moments amid the madness and mayhem. If you're in the mood for some crazy people to get through some deep hurt with one another in a funny way, you'll enjoy this atypical Christmas dark night comedy, especially if you've experienced Murphy's law: if anything can go wrong, it will.",1511740800,,1096,4.625641025641026

6637965,3,B00NC61CSS,"added this to my Christmas video collection as I like many of the actors in the movie.  Are there better holiday movies?  Yes. much better than this.  Being from Wisconsin, thought it was a bit much on the way the residents were portrayed.  It's taken me a while to watch a Robin William's performance again after his death, but I guess time has healed that. Being that it comes from an independent studio, was surprised at the number of known actors in the film.  Guess I gave it three stars as I like Joel McHale, Robin Williams, Lauren Graham, and Candice Bergman (loved the Jeffrey Tambour snowman in the snow globe, kind of weird but interesting).  Thought the film was not the best as far as acting goes, but it offers little material to work with.  It left me a bit empty after watching it.  Didn't want to watch it again right away like other holiday films may have made me feel.  Yes, it's no ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""White Christmas"".  It felt low budget to me and the only real reason I took a chance on it was to get an UHD 4K copy of it from another source than Amazon.  Fandangonow had it for the same price (UHD) as other services had it in regular HD (or even lower).  I would recommend viewing it if you have either Prime or HULU, but would refrain from buying it unless you really like it or want an UHD 4K copy to see how it looks on your 4K TV (even that isn't that impressive).  Maybe it will grow on me in future holiday viewing times of need, but for now, I wouldn't buy it.......either rent or if you can get it in an included streaming service, go that route.  I don't see it ever becoming a classic, but you never know, I was no fan of ""A Christmas Story"" either.",1509494400,,1692,4.230529595015576

6637978,4,B00NC61CSS,"If you are looking for a Christmas movie to watch with the kids, keep looking.  If you are looking for an extraordinary cast that makes you care about a deeply troubled set of characters who are doing their best to survive a family Christmas together, then you have arrived.  This was one of Robin WIlliams' last projects, and it show his acting skill as many films have not.  As the patriarch of the clan, he is a grumpy realist who never learned to show affection for his kids.  Candace Bergen is the mother, quietly determined to make her family work no matter the odds.  they are ably supported by an impressive cast.  If you grew up in a large family, the chances are you will recognize at least one of these characters.  The humor deflects well from the potential schmaltz of the constant theme that you can't escape family, because it's a part of you.",1489795200,5,858,4.496774193548387

The first words, within minute of the movie, was foul language, and continues throughout. Robin William's character is the worst at cursing, but even the kids say foul language from time to time. This is NOT a PG-rated family movie!

I was entertained with the cast of characters on the list, and it was a typical dysfunctional family Christmas movie. There were enough parts that were funny to keep me entertained. All the characters had their own quirks and funny hang ups, which gain momentum as the movie moves along. You have seen the plot before, but the entertainment comes from the actors playing the mixed up characters.

There is nothing like a dysfunctional Christmas movie.  I enjoyed seeing Candace Bergan and was reminded of the old days when she famously played Murphy Brown on TV.  I especially enjoyed seeing Robin Williams. I did not realize this was one of his last movies.  There is no one like Robin.  He was the funniest comedian ever and I miss him.

6638454,5,B00NC61CSS,"I thought it was really good!  And funny, too!  Father and son reconcile over Christmas; there are a lot of movies with a theme of family reconciliation, but they're very sentimental.  THIS movie is for grown-ups.  Also, this film is about a child coming to an age where he realizes that there's no such thing as Santa, versus parents trying to preserve their child's belief in the magic of Christmas.  I think also, this film might inadvertently have dealt with how a parent's alcoholism affects the family.  And there are a lot of cool nuances, too, like when Hobo Santa and Boyd are in a truck stop bathroom, and H.S. tells Boyd that sometimes Christmas miracles are right there in front of you, like looking at yourself in a mirror; Boyd's father, Mitch, has his epiphany when Boyd imitates his behavior, ie, Mitch is looking in a mirror, which renders a Christmas miracle.  And I might say, I don't recall seeing Candace Bergen ever to such a great job of characterization.  And I always thought Robin Williams did a great job when he played dramatic roles; in this one, when he apologizes to his son, it's really poignant.  And finally, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Tim Heidecker are just a treat to watch as Boyd's sister and brother-in-law.",1482624000,,1244,4.722222222222222

I've watched both him do comedy and drama with enjoyment, but I have never seen him play a thoroughly disgusting and unlikable character before. Other problems with the movie involved such caricatured and over-the-top dumb characters and such childish humor (ie imagine a long sequence of burp, fart, pee, etc jokes/lines/situations and toss in a handful of sexual jokes and you have it) that it was a toss up on if it would become more boring or more gross out by the end.

It's still fun, but your credibility as a parent stays in tact. That being said, I loved the true focus of this movie: how does a misunderstood and under-appreciated white collar son amend his relationship with his emotionally constipated blue collar dad? Against the background of a committed long-suffering mother, that journey, humorously told, is the real story and one that is heart-warming to watch. It may not be the reality for a lot of sons and fathers in that position, but a bit of escape not too far outside the realm of probability is the whole point, isn't it?",1482019200,,724,4.576923076923077

This was a good movie and made us laugh out loud several times
FUNNY
Enjoyable Christmas movie
Theme throughout is the father son relationship and the son's relationship and overcompensating towards his own son as a result.
This dysfunctional family was portrayed very well.
The actors and actresses all play their roles extremely well
HAPPY ending
Lots a lessons

NEGATIVES
The magic of the Santa scene could have been played upon more

I love his acting he really makes your believe that is who he is in the movie. I gave it a 4 because it is slow but it does have great points of interest and some funny moments.

It was consistently funny, had a happy ending, had decent enough acting (considering what is put out nowadays), and touched on many truths. I am guessing people with non-disfunctional upbringings will find it/ did find it offensive, but to the rest of us, it's like a fairytale where a jerk weed of a  father eventually realizes this to be true and apologizes to his grown son.  We all know in real life that true jerk-weed parents never come around and apologize. They always think they deserve credit for their child's successes when in fact the child became a successful adult to escape the jerk weed and that there are better parenting techniques than adversity in the form of constant belittling and pernicious verbal abuse.  So if you had a jerk weed for a parent, enjoy this movie. It's a gem. If you grew up in Leave it to Beaver land, pick something else to watch. You just won't get it.",1481328000,8,958,4.623529411764705

As this was Robin Williams last film, I expected classic ""Robin Williams comedy"" but that's not what you get. Robin Williams is brilliant but he's more serious than you might expect. This does show yet another movie in which he showed he was a capable actor None the less, the movie is funny throughout. I love Christmas movies and we're blessed with many classics and every few years, Hollywood makes another. I think most people would enjoy this if they're in the Christmas Spirit but if you're expecting a ""Mork and Mindy"" or ""Stand-Up"" Robin Williams you will likely be disappointed. The movie is not centered around him but I enjoyed it none the less. It's actually sad that we lost such a talent the way we did.

8677328,3,B00NC61CSS,"What is a father. Can Christmas be saved and how many things can go wrong. Plus, is Santa real? are many of the things addressed in this movie.
I didn't like the put downs of various groups and the hateful behavior the men showed each other but kept hoping for redemption.

A derelict Santa might make the spirit real if he doesn't drink too much of the spirits.

NOT a movie for kids. Not even a movie for some adults.

Surprised Robin Williams isn't mentioned in the synopsis. Maybe he isn't too proud of this one.
yet, his character shows the most growth and change.

If you like dark comedy this might be a holiday movie for you.",1514246400,,633,4.338983050847458
