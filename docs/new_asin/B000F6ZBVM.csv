8118166,5,B000F6ZBVM,"This is another of the superb documentaries produced in the later 1990's by the History Channel on WW2, the battles and weapons thereof.  This particular one concerns Hitler's so-called vengeance weapons, but they no fantasy, as they were very serious armaments. There were three of them, actually: the most famous of them, the A-4, better known as the Vergeltungswaffe 2, or V-2, was a dazzling piece of technology for the time.  It was the first man-made object to leave the Earth's orbit, and, once fired, was unstoppable.  After the war, it would obviously provide the engineering basis for the Cold War's ICBMs, as the Soviet Union unfortunately got hold of the technology also.  The main scientist involved,  however, Wernher von Braun, did go to America, and was a key aid in the development of the Saturn 5 Rocket.  Highly recommended.",1342828800,,843,4.985714285714286
