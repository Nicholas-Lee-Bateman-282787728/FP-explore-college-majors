6786219,5,B00P2G1O20,"Just beautiful!  I loved the poetry and I loved the poetic feel the film.  It didn't feel disjointed.  It felt like I was watching a poem and I loved it.  I liked the series of impressions, the images were beautiful and resonated throughout the film.  The film leaves a deep impresion on your mind.  It is food for the soul, not a quick entertainment fix.",1420588800,5,355,4.384615384615385
6786220,1,B00P2G1O20,This movie was very hard to follow. Such a shame to have such amazing actors in such an unamazing movie. What's worse is that I usually find something good in most movies. This one I felt I couldn't wait for it to be over.,1419379200,,222,4.068181818181818

6786224,4,B00P2G1O20,"First things first: for those unfamiliar with the work of Pulitzer Prize winning poet CK Williams, the following may be helpful - `CK Williams is especially known as an original stylist; his characteristic line is extraordinarily long, almost prose-like, and emphasizes characterization and dramatic development. His early work focused on overtly political issues such as the Vietnam War and social injustice. In his later work, Williams has shifted from a documentary style toward a more introspective approach, writing descriptive poems that reveal the states of alienation, deception, and occasional enlightenment that exist between public and private lives in modern urban America.' That this film is a project created by James Franco's class is another aspect of Franco's individuality in exploring all aspects of the arts. That it will not find a large audience is not so much the film as the concept that few viewers wish to become involved in a small introspective experimental film, preferring the big epics and apocalyptic ventures and coarse humor movies as escapes from reality. James Franco is a unique actor - quite gifted and wiling to take on difficult biographies (he has portrayed Allen Ginsberg, Hart Crane and others). Give him credit for paying homage to CK Williams.

The Color of Time is based on Pulitzer prize-winning poet CK Williams' collection of the same name. The film blends together adaptations of 11 of the poems to create a poetic road trip through CK William's life. The film takes us on a journey through several decades of American life from CK's childhood and adolescence in Detroit in the 1940s and 50s to the early 1980s: CK and his wife Catherine are married with their son Jed. CK prepares for a reading of 'Tar' in New York City, and spends his nights struggling to write new poems, haunted by memories of his past. As CK drives to his reading in New York City, he remembers central moments of his life: we come to experience and understand both his relationship to love and loss, and how he found his calling as a poet through the women in his life. The film takes us back and forth between past and present, punctuated by voice-over from CK Williams' poems, recreating the experience of memory and exploring how the fragments of one's man life can be turned into poetic expression: his loving relationship to his mother, his first sexual experiences as a teenager, his first love and the struggle to preserve a form of innocence and wonder, the illness and loss of a close friend, and finally his life together with Catherine.

The cast, though not individually used extensively includes Franco as CK Williams, Mila Kunis, Jessica Chastain, Zach Braff, Henry Hopper, Bruce Campell among many other bit parts. The music by Garth Neustadter and Daniel Wohl, contributes significantly and for a class project the `directors and writers' deliver a moody quiet  exploration of the genius of CK Williams. A bit of understanding on the part of the audience will result in a gently ekphrastic exercise. Grady Harp, December 14",1418515200,10,3063,5.0019607843137255
6786225,2,B00P2G1O20,"Imagine you're an NYU film student and, amazingly, you're going to be working on a feature film with Jessica Chastain, James Franco, and Mila Kunis. Pretty awesome, right? Now imagine their disappointment to learn the film would be another of Franco's ""passion projects"" nobody will ever want to watch. That's the case with The Color of Time, a biographical impression of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, CK Williams, directed by twelve of Franco's students as a narrative recreation of his work. It makes sense that fledgling talents would be a little unsure stylistically, much like their teacher, but the result is disjointed and trivial, and probably should have stayed in the classroom.

Hopping around in time to follow Williams at various life stages, he's played by a handful of actors including Franco and Henry Hopper. Taking the counter-intuitive route, a straight narrative is opted for rather than some kind of anthology with Williams' poems serving as the throughline. None of it amounts to much other than a series of bland flashbacks with sparse dialogue, and apparently Franco must have taught an extensive course on Terrence Malick. Right down to Chastain prancing in the grass under sun-drenched skies as Williams' angelic mother, her scenes are basically a shot-for-shot homage to The Tree of Life. Unfortunately, the other periods in Williams' life turn out much the same with each director aping the style of a different filmmaker they've probably long admired. It's distracting, especially if the ultimate goal is to put us closer in touch with Williams' elegant words. The Color of Time is essentially a series of cinematic postcards; beautiful but meaningless.

Also starring Zach Braff as Williams' best friend, Mila Kunis as his bubbly wife, plus an appearance by Bruce Campbell, there's certainly a wealth of talent here and they all bring a soulfulness to their performances. Best of all may be Kunis, who brings a levity and lightness that cuts through the droll mood. Fans of Williams who have found his poetry inspiring and profound will wish for more experienced directors who could bring that into being on screen. It's possible that in this group is the next Quentin Tarantino or Terrence Malick, but they aren't ready for the big leagues yet and The Color of Time is proof of that.",1418428800,9,2313,5.08421052631579

6786227,1,B00P2G1O20,"You can watch this movie in rewind and get the same thing out of it. Pointless, boring, and a bit depressing to say the least. Enjoy",1418342400,2,132,4.115384615384615
8686235,2,B00P2G1O20,"Please issue refund. Jessica Chastain is a wonderful actress, however, this movie was not one of her best roles.",1521072000,,112,4.947368421052632
8686236,3,B00P2G1O20,"After watching Jessica Chastain in multiple films, I am surprised she agreed to do this no matter how small her role is. I will only say that she and James Franco must be friends, or someone that knows him must be friends with her. ...Anyway, I'll try to give this movie a fair review as best I can. **If you're going to do an autobiography about someone, there should always be a solid background about that person not just a hodge podge of personal memories floated in front of you. Secondly, with movies like this, the audience always needs a clear timeline shown so we can keep up with what is happening. Otherwise, no matter how relevant a scene might be, it will just get lost. My theory about this film is that it's more of an arthouse film, best watched after one joint. Also, by the way it is presented... definitely reminds me of a Warholian, avant garde piece. With those issues in mind, it is definitely watchable... as I am a Warhol fan.",1516665600,,950,4.434285714285714
8686237,5,B00P2G1O20,"Excellent James Franco and cast. A surreal experience that revolves around ideas about death. Not for everyone to be sure, but if yu are tired of Outer Space action flicks his might be your ticket to buy.

Only 76 minutes...ferociously edited, like an Ingmar Bergman film.",1472083200,,272,4.913043478260869
8686238,1,B00P2G1O20,"Paid to watch this since I like the actors in it. But whoa, was it confusing and boring and sanctimonious all at once. Didn't engage me at all, and I kept scrolling to see how many more minutes were left. I tried to like it, I really did. But was only happy when it was over.",1465948800,,275,3.9285714285714284
8686239,4,B00P2G1O20,"The underlying tones and ideas of this movie are actually fantastic. The only major, structural things bringing it down are the fact that it is a little under-directed and that it doesn't pull off its free form style perfectly. Props to James Franco for involving his NYU film class in this picture, and bringing them on, apparently as directors and writers. Because of the artful and soulful qualities of this movie, it definitely lands on the high end of the spectrum for me. I can see that not all the people that watched it loved it. I think that is mainly owed to the fact that it is very free form, and has a very loose ""plot"" if you can call it that. And yes, as someone said, the people who won't like this will find it to be a ""knockoff"" of ""The Tree of Life,"" by Terrence Malick. However, my own personal ""bombshell"" that I drop on these reviews is that I hated ""The Tree of Life,"" and loved this movie. Something about ""The Tree of Life"" was way too abstract and meaningless in its attempt to have profound meaning. When I could figure out what that movie was about, I realized that it was going way too slow, and languishing on very unimportant developments. It was far too into cryptic symbolism. It was insanely tedious to the point of meaninglessness.

However, ""The Color of Time"" seems to have all of the good things of ""The Tree of Life"" and avoids the numbing abstract confusion of that movie. It has a nice meaningful feel to it and one never feels that it is jarring the senses. While the symbolism and meaning of events feel disembodied in ""The Tree of Life,"" they seem warmly connected in ""The Color of Time."" I also love that this movie is an exploration in the development of poetry and the meaning behind the words that this man CK Williams wrote. I was not aware of CK Williams before, but I love some of his insights, and his words make for a great movie.

The only real criticisms that I have are the fact that this movie sometimes feels a little under-directed, and that it is a little too loose in its meaning and plot.  A little more of a plot and an idea of what concrete developments were going on would have been helpful. If Franco could have pulled that off, this would be one of my favorite movies of all time. I keep seeing what James Franco is trying to do with movies like ""Palo Alto,"" and ""The Color of Time,"" but he seems to be missing what he's aiming for just ever so slightly. The underlying tone and attempt of those movies are quite brilliant, but he is not quite pulling off what he's reaching for. I get the feeling that if one of these movies really connects for James Franco, it will be brilliant, and one of my favorite movies of all time. I personally don't mind that this movie is a ""knockoff"" or heavily influenced by ""The Tree of Life,"" my favorite movie of all time is ""Go,"" which is largely a knockoff of ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it blended the great things of ""Pulp Fiction"" while eliminating the bad, like the excessive, sociopathic violence. I think that ""The Color of Time"" uses the abstract meaning of ""The Tree of Life,"" but eliminates the lethargic meaninglessness of it.  The only out and out mistakes in production are that not all the scenes set in the 1970s are really on point in terms of historical accuracy. There was kind of a 2016 feel to some of the buildings and costume and makeup choices. Like someone said, there was a credit card machine on a gas pump and James Franco's hair just seemed modern in some shots. While that should have been fixed, it didn't ruin the overall tone for me. I give it 3.5 - 4 stars.",1458345600,2,3584,4.384962406015037

8686244,4,B00P2G1O20,"What most people don't seem to realize about this film is that it's a student film. James Franco teaches a film class at NYU and each of his eleven students directed a short film based on the poetry of CK Williams, and then the eleven short films were edited into one movie. Franco obviously called in a lot of favors from his famous friends (Braff, Kunis, Campbell, Chastain) who only appear briefly in the film as an obvious one day on set. Several different styles are represented here, most obvious to me are Gus Van Sant and Terence Malick, but it's the poetry narrative that accompanies the beautiful images shown that truly captivates. Sure it's slow, sure there's apt of errors that should have been paid more attention to (a most obvious one to me is when Franco is at a gas pump and it's supposed to be the 70's but we can see the credit card reader screen behind him) but it's worth a little bit of admiration considering that these directors are probably just kids in their early 20's. And I can guarantee its their first experience working with such star power. There's unease and tension and beauty and poetry, and of course the never slowing James Franco. I give it 4 stars.",1422921600,,1189,4.534883720930233
