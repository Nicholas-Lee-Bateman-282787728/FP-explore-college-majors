8431868,4,B004JG9T9Y,"Morecambe & Wise become revolutionaries in this light and entertaining outing.  Don't watch if you are looking for meaningful cinema.  Watch for great timing and a really good send-up of modern revolutions in the vein of comedic Cuban Revolution.  They do their own stunts and keep the laughs coming.  Incredible DVD transfer -- perfectly restored -- which was an added bonus -- given the same level of transfer as the biggest blockbuster ""A"" pictures.  Highly entertaining and outrageous -- the way it should be. British humor shines through.  Only Morecambe & Wise could pull this one off.",1405814400,,591,5.041237113402062
