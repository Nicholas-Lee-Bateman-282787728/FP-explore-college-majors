3526018,5,B001D5C1FS,I love this tv series filmed in New Orleans.  I love the actors in the series also.,1282780800,,83,3.8823529411764706
3526019,3,B001D5C1FS,"Saw the original movie which was pretty good and thought when USA Network brought it to tv on Sunday nights that it would be a hit.  But it barely made it two seasons?  Good cast with Tony Crane as Remy McSwain, young Lesile Bibb(season 2), and Barry Corbin and shot entirely in New Orleans!!  Poor storylines(killer for most series)might have been it's down fall?  Remember, USA Network was still young and trying new things(a lot of Canada  produced but set in U.S. shows)to make a footprint.  The show needed to be just as ""gritty"" as the city it was in to survive but it wasn't??  Glad to see some of these short-lived shows come to dvd just to see some of the actors (Lesile Bibb-""Talladega Nights"", Robert Knepper-""T-Bag"" in ""Prison Break"" for one) who would go on to bigger stuff. But if you like seeing New Orleans, you'll really love this show!",1236124800,4,853,4.572368421052632

8291777,3,B001D5C1FS,good memories of an old program I used to enjoy.  Acting and stories are a bit dated but I enjoyed them nonethelessa,1493942400,,116,4.2727272727272725
8291778,5,B001D5C1FS,"I saw some of the show episodes when it was on, and had to have the whole series. Both season 1 & 2.",1478822400,,100,3.391304347826087
8291779,3,B001D5C1FS,not as good as the movie,1442620800,,24,3.1666666666666665
8291780,1,B001D5C1FS,"This is truly an awful series. The writing and acting are dreadful. I can't believe this series got picked up for one season, much less two.",1441670400,,140,4.423076923076923

8291783,2,B001D5C1FS,Was a little disappointed Susan Walters did not renew her role in this series.,1404259200,,78,4.642857142857143
8291784,4,B001D5C1FS,"The second season of off-beat mix of crime and romance is, like season one, filled with the unique flavor of New Orleans. Reason for the four stars (instead of five) is the absence of co-star Susan Walters. Her character, a new-to-NO assistant district attorney, a carry-over from the movie, is a better fit than that of her replacement, a young policewoman.,",1387843200,,359,4.901639344262295
8291785,4,B001D5C1FS,"This was a fun show during its run.  Never taking itself too seriously and always a great way to see New Orleans as well.  The writers, producers and directors made sure that the city was as much a part of the stories as were the players.  Good plot twists week from week, interesting guest stars and a stable of regulars that made you want to tune in each week. I'm glad they are finally on DVD, both seasons, and I've been enjoying watching them again after all these years.",1342742400,2,476,4.325842696629214
