8475013,5,B005IU8UT0,"Most any fan of the Golden Era of Radio, or Old Time Radio (OTR), will love this radio collection of the Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis Show.  They are one on my short list of favorites of Old Time Radio, and I actively collect a selection of OTR programs from the 1930's to the 1950's.  Their first radio program of their own featured the legendary Bob Hope---who gave them a boost during their infancy as an act not only on his own radio program, but also in launching their own weekly radio show.

The format was not uncommon....a comedy variety show, with popular celebrity guests and public figures.  However, the basis of the show featured the glaring contrast of the smooth and cool comedic straight man and crooner Dean Martin, paired against the often loud and over the top man-child of Jerry Lewis.  (Dean was also very funny himself!)  For those new to Old Time Radio, this was one of the few shows (like Bob Hope's or Jack Benny's show) that occasionally went off script---either through gaffs, laughing at themselves or improvised lines, making the show fresh and lively.  This was an era of live radio, as well as radio taped in front of a live audience for later airing.  You can feel that energy.

""The Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis Show"" (later called the ""Martin and Lewis Show"") also offered a nice cross section of timely celebrity guest stars such as sports athletes, singers, popular actors and actresses, and sometimes a politician or two.  The format was very close to that of their Colgate Comedy Hour (tv) shows of the same period.  The guest ""interviews"" and weekly sketches, blended with 2 or three singing numbers by Dean (backed by Dick Stabile and his Orchestra) made for a wonderful evening of fun that makes me wish people still sat around the old ""wireless"" in the 30's and 40's to enjoy great radio programming as a family.  You don't have to have lived through that era to appreciate the quality and charm either.  I didn't, but I still love it!

If you stopped long enough to read this review, then you will likely love it too.  You may even develop the desire to start collecting your own old radio programs.  With a disk set like this one, picking up a collection of shows from a particular program is made so much easier for the collector/enthusiast, since most of the aired programs are right there in one place.  I found that several of the originally aired shows on the disks included more than the bulk I was able to find individually on my own otherwise.

In mp3 format, you can easily listen to them at home or in your car, or transfer them to an mp3 player to listen to wherever you are, without having to mess with converting them to another format to be convenient for you. I have even played them over our tv/dvd sound system (with no picture at all, or with a pleasant visualization loop) to nearly simulate listening to them in the livingroom as they originally were.  It really makes for a pleasant little ""vacation"" from the regular din of the tv.  My young daughter easily plays in the livingroom with it on there, and if a period-specific reference pops up that is unfamiliar, it also  makes for interesting conversation in looking it up or sharing it with someone new to it,  Hearing various program sponsors (like Lucky Strike or Chesterfield for example) also gives you a feel for how different things are today.  With old programs of this kind, you will hear promos for other shows, a motion picture studio sponsor for an upcoming theater movie, and sponsor advertisements mentioned from food products to hair products, toothpaste, laundry soaps, to automobiles. Many of them read by the stars themselves, and many of the products are no longer in existence.  Surprisingly, some are still around---showing amazing longevity.  So, you have radio history featuring popular culture of the time, and refreshing nostalgia.

If you've not become a collector yet, this is a good place to start, ...with classic Dean and Jerry!",1363305600,,3974,4.698412698412699
