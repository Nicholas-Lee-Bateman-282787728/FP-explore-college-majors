Living in Fort Worth, it was interesting to get to know the man who designed the Kimbell and being Israeli made it interesting seeing the scene in Jerusalem.",1265068800,,265,4.911111111111111

8041570,5,B0006GVJLC,"I'm in the movie, My Architect, at 00:30 or so.  I just wanted you to know that after I saw the movie on the screen, I realized that the guys I said were cops were not New York City cops; they didn't have any pointy hats, no big blue coats, nothin'.  All they had was an attitude, like ""Go on, Go on about your business, don't get involved, we got this handled, get outta here"" although neither of them actually said anything to me.  I didn't recognize Lou Kahn; I had worked in the Richards Building in Philadelphia, but the plaque on the building was a picture of Alfred North Richards and not Lou Kahn.  So I think these two guys I talk about in the movie were holdup men; muggers.  And that's how Lou died in that men's room.  watch the movie and youll notice , like I did, how it affects me that Nathaniel says ""Heart attack.""  Of course; if the old  man was having a heart attack, he would not be able to ask me for help.  So he didn't; so eventually I just left.  Too bad.  Sorry about that, Lou.  Maybe next time.",1469577600,,1021,4.126903553299492

8041573,5,B0006GVJLC,"I love Kahn's work, so this was perfect. There are enough works of his that were not covered in depth, that a second documentary would be warranted. I've spent hours and hours looking at details of the British Museum at Yale--it's never enough!",1397088000,2,244,4.6976744186046515
8041574,4,B0006GVJLC,"Really good, funny movie with a story that anyone can enjoy. It is not about architecture. So, you don't have to be an architect to appreciate it.",1370563200,,146,4.444444444444445
8041575,5,B0006GVJLC,"When I viewed My Architect, I experienced a well written & skillfully directed Documentary about the life & works of Louis Kahn AIA; I was fascinated, interested, I learned, was informed & entertained (unlike most documentaries).
In My Architect, Nathaniel Kahn brings the viewer along & shares a son's journey of purpose. My Architect is a special documentary on multiple levels: A) The Quest: The desire, the need & will of a young man to understand ""Did my Father love me?"" B) The Uncomfortable Details: Nathaniel boldly unveils Lou Kahn's personal life through interviews with the ""wives"" & siblings from the 3 families his father simultaneously juggled. C) The Work, the Work, the Work... Nathaniel travels & beautifully films Lou's magnificent buildings & interviews many people involved & impacted by the Work. D) Insight: I learned so much about the man, his ways, his passion. E) Good History: Accurate History is important & Nathaniel Kahn has documented, collected & shared meaningful factual information. F) Made Me Think. My Architect caused me to think about Architecture & about how we each actualize our lives & make decisions.
This is a special entertaining & thought provoking documentary. L",1358726400,3,1209,5.173469387755102
