8164467,1,B000LV9VEY,"Obvious wolf in sheeps clothing here as this group is leading people down the wrong path.  Pope Benedict XVI allows full use of the John XXIII Mass of 1962 and is an instrumental theologian.  Remember, if you deny one council, you deny them all.  Never forget obedience.  I question ""Brother"" Dimond's comments and theology and I recommend avoiding this DVD at all costs.  If you have issues with the current Mass, I recommend reading the works of Justin Marytr, you will be surprised to find that the current Mass matches the one he described in the second century.",1208044800,4,566,4.73469387755102
