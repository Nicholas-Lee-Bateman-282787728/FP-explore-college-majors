5708765,5,B00CA4S04C,"Ever since the tragic passing of Ronnie James Dio 3 years ago, there has been a plethora of re-releases and they have all been great.  I have enjoyed all the Rainbow, Sabbath and Dio 2 Disc Deluxe editions as well as the Heaven and Hell and Rainbow Live in Munich DVD sets.  Even the Dio At Donnington is great, but I think the expanded re-release of Finding The Sacred Heart DVD really sets itself apart from all the rest.  This DVD shows the 1986 model of Dio on fire!  Ronnie sounds awesome, but I was especially blown away by Craig Goldie on the DVD.  I knew he was great guitar player, but his performances are KILLER!  Everything about this DVD from the sound to the visuals are pretty damn near perfect, but the CD soundtrack just misses the mark by a tad. It could have used a little more care when it was mixed and prepared for mastering.  However, the audio soundtrack does sound better than the CD after I loaded it into my iPod for some reason.  But do I recommend getting both the CD and the DVD?  Of Course!  But you might find yourself watching the DVD more than you would listening to the CD.

But as an added note, 2 more weeks until the re-release of Ronnie's 2000 release Magica!",1370649600,9,1198,4.327354260089686
5708766,5,B00CA4S04C,DIO was in my opinion one of the best singer of heavy metal. He always gripped the public in live presentations. This show was spectacular!!,1370563200,,140,4.64
5708767,5,B00CA4S04C,Dio is the master of heavy metal and this concert proves it. He may have sold his soul but he shines like a diamond in the sky. Long Live Rock N Roll. Craig Goldie shreds and Vinny Appice beats his skins harder than a logger in forest!,1370390400,,235,4.0212765957446805
5708768,5,B00CA4S04C,"I got the blu ray of this show,,the very first time i saw dio was on this tour so to see it in its entirety on bluray was amazing,,,this tour was arguably dios best tour ever..i saw dio seven times throughout his career..the first in 1986 the last was in 2007..and the master always delivered mind blowing shows,,how we all miss him,,,back to this dvd..this show deserves the respect and admiration of any dio show or tour released on dvd..awesome from start to finish..goldy tears it up the entire band is spot on.and a stage production that to this day has been unmatched,,.and of course ronnie james dio puts his vocal talents to another level..you cant help but be in total awe watching this guy sing..the true voice of metal..if you are a fan of metal or would love to see a true metal legend performing at his youthful best then this dvd is a must have..you will watch this and just won't be able to get enough..or do what i did and watched it again..",1370217600,,957,4.443181818181818
5708769,5,B00CA4S04C,"Remember that crappy, edited-to-hell DVD that only had half a show? Well, you can 'find' mine in the trash can because this awesome spectacle has finally been released in its uncut glory.

+ Always amazing to see a young Ronnie James Dio
+ Craig Goldy > Vivian Campbell
+ For the first time, it's the entire show from beginning to end
+ Awesome stage production
+ Really good sound
+ Wild key solo
+ Unlike most Dio shows, Ronnie sings when he's supposed to sing and shuts up during solos instead of adding annoying, constant banter
+ Seriously... watch Craig Goldy play

- 16:9 aspect ratio
- Holy Diver and Man on the Silver Mountain played too fast
- Graig's guitar a little too low in the mix",1369958400,2,696,4.4296875
5708770,5,B00CA4S04C,"You can feel the enthusiasm blasting out from the Dio band on this evening. Not just the music was blasting but the vibe is infectious. I caught myself smiling repeatedly as I watched this. Playing in front of 20,000 in a great city (Philly) in front of appreciative fans the band absolutely smokes. Sure, most of this material has been released before but this is the first time the full concert is presented in it's correct running order. The Blu-Ray doesn't really add much in picture quality over the DVD but this is a 27 year old show so it's great. Essential purchase for Dio fans.",1369958400,,587,4.547169811320755
5708771,5,B00CA4S04C,"I have watched quite a few DVD performances done by DIO and Company. This is the best sounding best done, best performance, best stage show I have ever seen by this group. The group is fantastic in this performance. The one and only complaint I have is that I wish the lead guitar sound was more defined like the other instruments are in this performance.
 Great job DIO and lets not forget Eagle Productions for doing another fine job with this DVD. Go out and get this one it is Excellent!",1369872000,8,491,4.395604395604396
5708772,4,B00CA4S04C,"I have been a fan of RJD for over 30 years and attended several concerts, including this tour. IMHO this was Dio at his all time best with soaring vocals right on key every time. As the concert shows, he spent a lot of time finding an individual in the audience, making eye contact, and making a lifetime memory for that fan. Even though this was one of Craig Goldy's first shows with the band you would never know it. The music is crisp and sound mixing is excellent.

My only problem with the BluRay comes down to expectations in video quality. While I know this was filmed 27 years ago on 16 mm I thought the remastering would result in better picture quality. There are a few up close cameras that look great, but others that look like they copied it straight from VHS. Nonetheless, this is a great addition to any Dio fan out there!",1369785600,12,837,4.3312101910828025
5708773,5,B00CA4S04C,"If you were ever a fan of the legendary Ronnie James Dio then you absolutely MUST add this to your DVD library. It captures the late Mr. Dio at one of many majestic and fine moments! The sheer sound of his voice alone is enough to awe any Dio fan! Witness Dio's legendary voice, stage theatrics and creative backdrops! Hear the thunder of the drums on classics like King of Rock n Roll to the screaming guitar of then new guitarist Craig Goldy on We Rock! Some Sabbath & Rainbow era songs are revisited as well. This will NOT disappoint! Long live Rock n Roll and may Ronnie James Dio as well through the wonderful legacy he has left us in his amazing music! R.I.P. Ronnie J. Dio and eternal thanks for the memories!",1367366400,28,716,4.350746268656716

5708804,5,B00CA4S04C,"Purchased as a gift for a Dio lover, and it was a huge hit! I was skeptical of how the 'blu ray' quality would be, considering the footage is 30 years old. But the whole DVD looked and sounded great. I am learning to have an appreciation for Dio and his contribution to rock & roll, and no kidding- the live concert performance was stellar. Totally recommend for any rock fan's collection.",1476057600,,389,4.416666666666667
5708805,5,B00CA4S04C,"There are two Dio concerts that made it to video that are must-haves, truly epic Dio in grandiose scale, peak talent, classic/epic song set, and at the peak of his career and singing capability:  ""Special from the Spectrum"", and ""Finding the Sacred Heart"" are those two shows.  These two concerts captured Dio at his absolute best.  Everything captured on video/DVD/blu-ray after that has been notably more tired, low-scale, lesser bands, small venues, and generally speaking, a notable fading career and ability.  Spectrum and Sacred Heart are the only 2 Dio concerts that truly capture the full epic power and magic of the 1980s Dio sports arena tours.

Though these concerts were originally shot on 16mm film, the Blu-Ray format of this re-released concert at least means you'll be seeing every bit of quality the film could possibly capture at the time.  This cannot be said for the original VHS version (which I bought may years ago) and even the DVD verson, which still add its own pixelated limitations to this masterfully remastered video and audio.

The performance is flawless, though I think Vinny Appice's drum solo was considerably less of an event than on Spectrum, which in itself was considerably less of a solo than on Black Sabbath's Live Evil.  Craig Goldy did a fantastic job, but is sadly the victim of a production blunder that makes it sound like the microphone was 50 feet away from his amps (very distant).  Otherwise the sound and performances are epic and earth-shattering.

This is the best Dio concert ever captured at the hight of his popularity and peak of his abilities.  A MUST HAVE.

Now, if you want to see what a BAD review looks like for a Dio concert, then head on over to my review for Dio's ""Live in London Hammersmith Apollo 1993"", which was so bad that it should have never been released.",1472774400,4,1830,4.792993630573249

5708846,4,B00CA4S04C,"Watching this film was very enjoyable. I saw this tour back in 1986 and it was nice to see a representation of what that show was. This is definately better than watching some bootleg off YouTube or that you download from a bootleg site. It has been filmed with multiple cameras, and it looks like it was filmed yesterday. The show had an amazing setlist, and this shows it. The sound was amazing, you can listen in regular stereo (PCM), of in DTS (5.1).
  I'd recommend this to any Ronnie James Dio , or metal fan in general.

5708856,4,B00CA4S04C,"Ronnie James Dio, in my opinion, is one of the best rock vocalists of all time. He was a member of Rainbow, Black Sabbath and his own band Dio. songs from each of those periods are represented here on this video. i wold have to say that the song selection is a good one and well performed.

On the down side, it did not have Vivian Campbell as the guitarist. apparently, he just recorded the Sacred Heart with Dio and they replaced him with Graig Goldy for the tour. the quality of the music after the departure of Vivan Campbell was never the same, in my opinion. also, Craig Goldy's guitar solo did not impress me much. much of it was just going crazy with a delay pedal on, making flying saucer and spaced out sounds more so than actual music. that was a big disappointment to me. I would have given the video 5 stars if it were not for that. Sorry Craig.",1413331200,,858,4.2317073170731705

5708860,5,B00CA4S04C,"Dio was one of rocks most prolific heavy rock lead singers!  His stage presence was second to almost no one.  This BluRay used an entirely different master tape than the original crappy quality DVD, which was mastered from a VHS tape as I recall.  HA!  This BluRay was very good in the video quality on a 60"" plasma, almost excellent.  Completely satisfying, and I saw the actual concert to compare the two.  The audio is 5.1 DTS-HD and is also very good, clean, powerful, good bass signal, clear sharp lead and bass guitars, and the organ with it's range sounded full and immediate.  The 5.1 channel mux is sweet.

GOOD all the way around. Some of the concert videos have embarrassing sound quality but not THIS one.  Played through a large McIntosh Labs system and coming out 4 K-Horns from Klipsch.  Yessir.  We Rock.

Heaven & Hell rolls into the Sacred Heart via a couple solos --- and still at my advancing age gives me a tingle.  POWER ROCK!!!  They don't make THAT any more.  The laser fight scenes were mostly but not entirely cut out, and in the live show I attended was really neat.  The dragon and stage were dramatic and fit the music perfectly!  If you like Dio but were disappointed with the original DVD, have faith and buy THIS BluRay, and your Rock prayers are answered.  (Waxing poetic here tonight, I guess.......)  :)

All in all, VERY well done and overdue.  Once you see this, you'll give your DVD to your nephew.  Also special is that Dio's wife was in charge of this production.  May Ronnie RIP.",1410825600,,1520,4.527675276752768

5708877,4,B00CA4S04C,"Well let's try this again.  I thought I had done this already, but I may be a bit too drunk for reviewing and for some reason it wasn't saved!  But hey, this is a DIO recording, so I should be a bit screwed up to be watching/reviewing this.

The good:  The video is excellent.  From the time period and since it's metal, not pop, to have a 16:9 video is awesome.  I don't think it was originally 4:3 and changed because it's not stretched or chopped at the top. I wish they could have had a better angle on the drummer, but that's probably more to do with the stage setup than anything else.  Way too much keyboard player which was annoying.

The bad:  The DTS-HD surround track is awful.  No bass and no band in the surrounds.  Unacceptable.  Iron Maiden's recordings from the decade have more surround.  Listen to the LPCM track rather.  Has more bass and doesn't have the disconnected sound the DTS-HD does.

For an historical piece it's worth the buy.  I love the back stage cut that has everyone passing a doob and cracking jokes. Awesome.  It seems like a bit of cash grab.  If Ronnie as still alive, a no brainer purchase.  To fund the lifestyle of his ancestors.....  well....",1379894400,2,1184,4.4186046511627906

The bluray transfer is great although there are some grainy parts, but not a big deal.  One CON I did find, and understandable, is the abuse of keyboards. Of course, this is 1986 and found them great back then, but not anymore.  DIO's vocals are amazing, this is a top notch performance for him and his vocals stood proud and got immortalized in this concert.  This is a masterpiece, nothing short of that can be said.

5708885,4,B00CA4S04C,"Because he did a whole lot of obscure stuff that I like even more than his commercial releases and besides I was at the very last Texxas Jam back in I think it was '88 or '89 after he did these Philly shows but the dragon was broken down and he even announced on stage that the band would not be using it but it was a fantastic show anyway where there were an estimated 80,000 people in the Cotton Bowl audience and it was the last time that I ever got to see him live and I own the VHS tape of this show but have been debating on whether I need the dvd but I think that I might get it anyway because the video has been cleaned up and it's clearer and sounds better than the VHS. This is the one on VHS that was called ""Sacraed Heart: The Video"" on VHS.",1373932800,,753,3.8645161290322583
5708886,3,B00CA4S04C,I always found Dio to be corney.  Through his career he has made some great music but to me its a limited great.  Most of his best stuff is here minus some Sabbath greats.  So to me Dio will never get higher than a 3 on any album or video.  It's just my opinion.  Reading the credits on song writing is a joke.  Like I need a percentage of who get credit on songwriting.  I highly doubt the accuracy.  Kind of like Jake E lee on bark at the moon.,1373068800,,446,3.8777777777777778

5708890,5,B00CA4S04C,I saw this tour in 1985. I was 13 years old at the time. You don't see many live shows with such a production. Great performance & visual. Ronnie always sounds so amazing live. And this Full Live Version of the Sacred Heart show is nice and loud! Definitely recommend to any DIO or Metal fan. Long Live the Magic & Music of Ronnie James Dio!,1371513600,,341,4.181818181818182

5708892,5,B00CA4S04C,"I saw this show live i Sweden two months prior to this recording at the Spectrum in Philly. I realize now how good their deliverance really was. Craig Goldy was new in the band and he is really blistering throughout the show. Strange he never sounded the same on the Dream Evil-album a year later, even if the song-writing had improved since Sacred Heart. Anyway, I strongly recommend this dvd to anyone into Ronnie James Dio's efforts. Powerful sounding.",1370908800,,455,4.772151898734177
5708893,4,B00CA4S04C,"Add me to the list of people who love this DVD!

I was not expecting the picture to look so good -- and the sound is spectacular.  A friend gave me the ""Sacred Heart: The Video"" DVD, and I've probably only watched it twice since it came out back in 2004 because of the standard transfer quality, and something else.  I couldn't put my finger on it, but something just made me go, ""Eh.""  I've since read reviews where others have noted the bad editing and that would make sense, though, I have yet to compare the two closely.  From the get, ""Finding The Sacred Heart: Live In Philly 1986"" is a completely different animal!

Of course, this is the first time we get to see the full concert -- and it is in proper running order.  How in the world you decide to leave off ""Like The Beat Of A Heart"" the heaviest, and one of the standout tracks from ""Sacred Heart"" is beyond my understanding.  Not to mention the Dio live staples of ""Don't Talk To Strangers,"" ""Stand Up And Shout,"" and ""We Rock.""  A word of note: The track list for both the DVD and CD state that ""Children Of The Sea"" is in the ""Last In Line"" medley, but all this consists of is Dio saying, ""Look out!,"" 4 or 5 times to musical bursts then, ""You're all children of the sea.""  There is no actual music from the song played, so don't get excited to hear any of that masterpiece included.

Also included are all the solos from Claude, Craig and Vinnie.  I have to say that I never really cared for Claude Schnell's board-work in the band.  I know he is a great musician, but neither his style, nor sound ever meshed well with rest of the band for me.  If I had to pick a soft point in the band, the first place I would look would be Claude.  That said, I was impressed with what he did in his solo with some cool sounds and riffs.  Also, Craig Goldy's solo, not to mention guitar work throughout the show, should raise peoples opinion about of him as musician.  He definitely plays better live than on the albums.  And Vinnie is... Vinnie, no surprises there.

Regardless of what people say about ""Sacred Heart"" the album -- and I'm one of those who feel people come down harder on that album then is necessary (people tend to forget about the equally ""pop""ish moments from previous albums such as ""Mystery,"" ""One Night In The City"" and even the ""Heavy Metal classic"" ""Rainbow In The Dark"" which is, by far, the most radio friendly thing on an otherwise heavy album) the tour was a standout with great versions of older songs and a cool stage show.  Of course, the stage show will seem dated, and perhaps, overblown by the standards of today, but even if you were a frequent concert goer at the time, you got to see things you'd never seen before set to great music.  So it helps to view it in that sense.

The thing I like about Ronnie as a performer is that he sings with his whole body, always making gestures to the audience, belting his head back, and taking dramatic stances while holding eye contact with the audience more than any other performer I've ever seen live.  If you were ever lucky enough to see him in concert, he always made the show feel it was about you -- no matter where you were sitting!

The extras are nice.  The interview with Dio and Goldy from the previous DVD was thankfully ported over to the new release.  And we get some promo clips for the tour including a brief interview and some amusing home video of backstage-- the lesson being don't mess with Vinnie's meatballs!  We also get a promo video for ""Rock And Roll Children.""  A goofy, but entertaining video I remember being run a couple times on Mtv when they actually had variety in their programming before isolating all things Metal (and for some reason, Glam?) into a 3 hour block on Saturday nights starting at 11 or 12.  I only wish they would have included the videos for ""Hungry For Heaven"" and ""King Of Rock And Roll,"" but this is a bonus feature and you can't really gripe about what's not there.

As of now, this is the best representation of the (near) classic lineup available on DVD, which makes it a must have for Dio fans.  Hopefully Niji will get to produce proper discs for the currently chopped-up shows on the ""We Rock"" DVD put out by Universal, and add some nice extras.  I'm also hoping Niji doesn't forget about their original plans to produce the Super Rock Japan '85 show with Vivian Campbell on guitar, and the expanded ""Time Machine"" DVD with ALL the Dio promo videos.

EDIT:

I knocked my rating from 5 to 4 stars because I forgot about the altered format.  This is a big deal with me and slapping black bars on the top and bottom of the screen to simulate widescreen is totally unnecessary and ends up ruining the framing.",1370736000,4,4698,4.367088607594937

The stage setup is very medieval and unique which just adds to the whole Holy Diver theme. The production of the show itself is superb. Lighting, camera angles, lazers, smoke, sound, etc. Then, pair this production with the power of blu ray and you have an amazing concert in your possession. My only regret is that I didn't have good enough speakers to crank it. Watched it twice already and will revisit this many more times. If you like good music, performance art and just pure awesomeness...then buy this. R.I.P Dio \m/",1490054400,,658,4.730434782608696
