4123419,2,B003GOOZX0,"Another remake of a Japanese horror film featuring SURPRISE an evil female spirit!
While director Fruit Chan creates an eerie atmosphere, the script is so disjointed, the movie ultimately collapses on itself.
ET's Henry Thomas seems lost in his role and Reshad Shirk (sp) is a weak lead.

4123420,2,B003GOOZX0,"You can say whatever you want about any film and the actors in it - but without a good script and a decent plot, the cast's talents are wasted, no matter how good the actual performers are.

Many films these days boast similarities to ""The Ring,"" but in reality they only borrow slightly from the cinematography and the eerie ghost storyline. In ""Don't Look Up,"" a troubled young film director goes to Transylvania to the scene where an ancient movie was filmed many years ago. The set where the movie was filmed was supposedly haunted by the presence of a young girl (there's a big shocker).

The story seems decent enough, but it is not really elaborated on enough, and the main characters kind of fumble about in an attempt to....well....I still couldn't figure that one out. It is basically a movie made without much of a point or much direction. The ""scary"" scenes won't make you jump and the plot is so full of holes that the effects of any ""twists"" the writers included in the storyline just add to the confusion. And on top of that, there are some attempts at humor when not-so-vague comparisons are made to ""Young Frankenstein,"" and they come at odd moments and the characters do a poor job of transitioning from funny to serious, making the film not only hard to understand, but also awkward.",1280620800,4,1302,4.607758620689655
4123421,3,B003GOOZX0,"Don't Look Up is a movie that offers quality cinematography, but isn't theater-quality because of plot holes and weak performances.

Director Fruit Chan gained a cult following thanks to the underground success of ""Gaau Ji"" (Dumplings), his short film on the ""3 Extremes"" DVD.  I enjoyed his work on that film, and even though Dumplings wasn't an overt horror film, it was more chilling than this one.  Chan makes for a visually pleasing movie, but he would have done better with a different story.

The marketing behind the movie is also misleading.  The DVD cover states ""From the creator of The Ring comes a new vision in terror.""  Only it's not new, it's a story that Hideo Nakata came up with for a movie he shot several years before The Ring.  The original version of Don't Look Up wasn't especially popular, and the 2009 remake isn't remotely as scary as The Ring.

I definitely enjoyed Reshad Strik's performance in the Hills Have Eyes 2 (bearded young guy), but was disappointed with him in this film.  As a psychologically troubled young film director, Strik overreacts being afraid to the point where it's almost comical.  Eli Roth (Donny the Bear Jew from Inglourious Basterds) gets top billing in this film, but he gets only about a minute of actual screen time.  Film veteran Kevin Corrigan is a welcome addition to the cast, as is the seriously hot Carmen Chaplin.

My biggest complaints about the film include the plot holes and use of too many subplots.  The bottom line is that the movie is made more confusing than it had to be.  There's a bit of gore for hardcore horror fans, though the CGI may disappoint some people.  Nakata also recycled one idea involving a fly from this movie to The Ring.  I also thought that the twist at the end was simply unnecessary.

Overall, I just didn't find it that scary.  Chan did a good job, but the story just wasn't that great.  It seems like they were hoping to capitalize on the popularity of The Ring by remaking a previous movie that wasn't very popular back in 1996.  It's worth giving a watch, but I would suggest that you not buy the DVD until you give this one a Redbox rental first.",1280361600,9,2149,4.590551181102362
4123422,1,B003GOOZX0,"Don't spend the money.  Renting it was the scariest part about this movie.  This movie was so slow.  I turned it off about midway.  I could not take it anymore.  The acting was poor, a goofy story line, and the special effects are not any better than they where in the 70s & 80s low budget movies.  ""From the creator of THE RING""???

Confusing.

8396530,2,B003GOOZX0,"Don't Look Up (Fruit Chan, 2009)

Had you told me in 2008 that Hollywood would import Fruit Chan, the director of the phenomenal little flick Dumplings, to do Yet Another Asian Horror remake, I'd have laughed at you. If you then told me that Chan would bungle the movie almost completely, I probably would have been laughing so hard I wouldn't have been able to breathe.

And yet here we are with Don't Look Up, a remake of Hideo Nakata's 1996 flick Jyu-rei. And it is almost as horrible as the critics would have you believe.

Plot: a film crew working on a low-budget horror picture (why can't film crews in horror films ever be working on, say, a lavish costume drama?) discovers footage of a much older film shot in the same location by cult director Bela Olt (Inglorious Bastards' Eli Roth), who, according to the local folklore, went insane during filming, as did most of the surviving cast and crew after one cataclysmic night of bloodshed. Of course, the present-day film crew, headed up by equally obsessed director Marcus Reed (The Hills Have Eyes II's Reshad Strik) and producer Josh Petri (Gangs of New York's Henry Thomas), puts no stock in such stories...but after they view the old footage, strange things start occurring on the set...is the ghost of lead actress Lila Kis (You Don't Mess with the Zohan's Rachael Murphy), or the witch she was portraying in that old film, haunting the new production?

All of which sounds good. And by all rights, from everything I've heard, it is good, when directed by Hideo Nakata. But this? This is just another bad re-tread, made all the worse for being directed by a guy who is, when not working within the confines of Hollywood, one of Japan's most innovative, witty directors. How did this go so horribly wrong? We may never know the answer to that question, but there can be no argument about the fact that something certainly did. Perhaps the production was haunted by the spectre of Yasuyo Shirashima? **",1367020800,3,1964,4.700581395348837
8396531,1,B003GOOZX0,"Forget looking up...just DON'T!

Another American J-Horror remake of...something...that is virtually incomprehensible.

A film crew doing a remake of a ""doomed"" silent film are attacked by evil spirits and lots and lots of terrible CGI flies. Despite the advertising, Eli Roth is in the film for less than five minutes before the opening credits.

Instead, we gets lots of shots of the attractive yet wooden and thoroughly unlikable leading man standing open-mouthed amid swarms of aforementioned terrible CGI flies, causing me to recall the scoldings of Sister Ruth Ann in second grade shouting, ""Close your mouth, before you start catching flies!!""

8396532,5,B003GOOZX0,"Not that a truly scary movies always makes a good movie as far as horror movies go...  However The execution of the movie is done just right so that it isn't too disgusting, while still disturbing you quite a bit. Hidieo Nakata (creator of The Ring and this film) must be really talented because even though it has the whole angry ghost in common this is nothing like The Ring and still very intriguing in it's own way... Very cool story not like the other movies that reel you in with a dramatic and nicely drawn cover just so you can end up watching another story-less, comedic but overall worthless, waste of time that lives you more unsatisfied than you were before the movie...  from the cover it looks like another one of those silly b-horror titled that somehow was not categorized as such.  Also from the cover it could be confused for a boring drama of sort but it isn't, Lol don't watch this alone, or if you do, keep your wits about you, some scenes catch you completely off-guard!

8396533,1,B003GOOZX0,"A troubled movie director Marcus Reed (Reshad Strik) is given a chance to shoot a film in Romania. In an old movie studio that had been long disused, strange things happen to him and the crew, and apparently they have something to do with an abandoned film project in the 1920s that was shot in this studio. Also, Marcus is tormented by an image of a woman he keeps seeing.

While the premise of ""Don't Look Up"" is not bad, the film itself is a terrible mess. Confusing and incoherent, the story of ""Don't Look Up"" doesn't make sense. Perhaps with exception of one brief sequence about the creepy image of a woman, the film remains unoriginal throughout.

""Don't Look Up"" is a remake of a 1996 Japanese horror film ""Jyoyu-rei"" (""Ghost Actress""). The latter marked director Hideo Nakata's feature debut before he made a J-horror classic ""Ringu."" Despite Nakata's clever use of movie studio, and effectively creepy moments of the titular ""actress,"" ""Jyoyu-rei"" is far from perfect with a weak plot and an underwhelming conclusion.

Its remake is much worse. Everything looks amateurish here: incoherent story, cheesy production design, cheap special effects and wooden acting. Directed by Fruit Chan, Chinese-born director who has made much better films in the past such as ""Made in Hong Kong,"" ""Don't Look Up"" is simply a terrible movie.",1299715200,,1336,4.928888888888889

Simply put, this movie should have been entitled, ""Don't Throw Up,"" due to all the bad acting, story line, special effects, etc. If there were a lower rating than one star, I would have rated that for this film. Now I understand why there were so many flies used in this movie - it's because it smelled like fresh dog crap. I am positive that this film is the worst I have seen in decades.

I watch films very carefully and this one, while not a true stinker, tap dances very close to the edge of being a ""bad"" movie.  The acting is good and bad in places.  The issues with the film are many.  It moves slowly which is fine when it is engaging.  The film fails to engage.  The plot is neither creepy nor scary.  It comes off almost feeling like a spoof until you realize that it is trying to be serious.  The movie falls squarely into the middle of the mediocre classification.  It is not something, which I would own or really even want to watch again.  The film simply tries and fails.",1287964800,2,700,4.259541984732825
