Well I got rid of the video a year or two ago thinking he was to old for it. Well I have never lived that down, he has reprimanded me time and time again! So, for Valentine Day this year I got him the video as a joke. The joke is on me, he was so excited to get it again and even noticed there was another episode on this one that wasn't on the one he had. He went home and proceeded to watch it. Guess that says something for this video!!! I would recommend this video and don't get rid of it if you get it for your child, it will come back to haunt you!",1268092800,6,697,3.7162162162162162
