We continue to check out the Fantastic Movie Trailers series, and now that we've purchased the entire library, we'll be doing more reviews.

Drive In Frenzy focuses on Drive In fare, most of which comes from the 70s and 80s. Some of the films are classics of their own kind, but most of them are just drive in swill. Still, as always Montreal Film Studio has put together a heck of a collection for nearly two hours of fun!
