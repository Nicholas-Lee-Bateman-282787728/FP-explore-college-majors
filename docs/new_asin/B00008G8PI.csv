7983556,5,B00008G8PI,I first got into this series back when I had first started college one of my friends had the complete series in box set and he let me borrow it i loved it!! sure it's dark and it had an interesting spin on the so called bible and all that religious stuff. It reminded me of SMT as shin megami tensei since it's all about that kind of things and its dark too. When I saw it I knew I had to get it even if it was in individual dvds. The anime was really great although I prefer the manga then the anime since they did change quite a bit of things for example Jun's occupation in the manga she was a teacher not a model and her best friend didn't exist in the manga so yeah but either way it's a great series to watch and I highly recommend it.,1367884800,,741,3.8815789473684212
7983557,4,B00008G8PI,"Continuing the erosion of Jun's mental state in the previous episodes, the DVD paints an increasingly horrible picture of a world held at bay by demonic creatures.  While in Jun's interior mindscape a similar battle between human and beast takes place.  This adaptation of Go Nagai's original story captures both the horror and the tension as Jun struggles to keep her humanity and falters.
Starting small in an episode in which Jun finally faces her stalker we are introduced to the third demon with a speaking part - Satoru, who develops into a ringleader of the 'evolved' demons.  He is everything Jun is not - cruel, manipulative, and anxious to leave behind his human heritage.  His flock soon starts decorating Tokyo with the remains of their victims and panic begins to mount in the streets.
Satoru works away at Jun's mental equilibrium, even using Kazumi against her, until the once successful model loses confidence in her ability to control herself as either demon or human.  With Kazumi estranged and Asuka away from Japan, Jun's support system, always wobbly, teeters on the edge of collapse.  She is haunted by her grim deeds as a demon and plagued by Satoru's attacks.  In every episode, more tears are shed.
What stands out for me about this DVD is the way the tension is turned way up.  The only break for the viewer (or Jun) is the pause between episodes.  I have felt that all the episodes thus far have been bleak and dark, but this DVD is another creature entirely.  Unlike the classic 'human becomes monster' story, ""The Devil Lady"" provides a strong psychological undercurrent in addition to a fast moving and violent plot.  A slight change to the artwork seems to add to the edgy effect.
With this DVD, the longer story arcs begin to operate full tilt, making this a bad DVD to start in on the series.  If you like a strong, unnerving story, by all means track down the entire series and prepare for a roller coaster ride through the dark mind of one of Japan's masters of horror.",1054166400,3,2004,4.694285714285714
