6397852,4,B00K0S2RZI,Originally I posted on season 8 Part 2 that I probably won't be buying this season but for the price and I have ever season and season10 is good so far I just wish they didn't take like 6 month breaks but back to season 9 part 1 after watching it again it's still better then some other shows I guess the build up is what ruined it in the beginning but it better the 2nd time around especially waiting for part 2 season 10 i just wish it was the original team,1404172800,2,459,3.946236559139785

6397861,3,B00K0S2RZI,"I love this series. Please don't get me wrong there. But it seems like every other season, there are discs that just won't play all the way through. I just spent all evening switching from my regular DVD player (which is old and admittedly should be replaced) to a new, cheap DVD player that I'm sort of using as a stop-gap for older discs until I grudgingly switch over to Bluray, and then further to my laptop's DVD player, where they did best but still not well. Disc 1 locks up about halfway through the third episode and won't play the fourth at all. Disc 2 locks up completely on everything but my laptop, and even then, by the third episode, it locked up twice before ejecting itself as a read error.

I'd send it back, but it's not the seller's fault, and I doubt another set of discs will be any better. Please, SyFy. Whatever you're doing to these discs makes them unplayable, even when there's no visible sign of damage. We want to enjoy your product, but it's incredibly frustrating when three separate DVD players won't play even one whole disc.",1470009600,,1058,4.481865284974093

6397866,4,B00K0S2RZI,"I have all of the Ghost Hunters DVD's, they had a certain way of doing things, like the intro to the shows, the review of the investigations, for all of the previous 8 seasons, dare I say it, when Grant was still there? I love Jason, but the format of the shows has changed, it makes a big difference and not for the better. The music is way tooo loud, when the hunters are investigating and they get a look on their face like they heard something, instead you hear the music that at first sounds like a scream or a bang... NOT good... music too loud, noisy, don't like the mix this time around. And yes, packaging was a mess. All fell apart when I took off the shrink wrap and dvd's were scratched.

6397888,3,B00K0S2RZI,"Great series, but this packaging needs work. I picked up the box to open it and it sounded like a child's rattle. I was kind of afraid to open the box or the plastic wrapping because I was afraid of not being able to return the opened DVD case. I included a picture below, plastic pieces were everywhere. It doesn't look like the DVDs were damaged but now I have no way of securing the DVD set without them spreading out over the case, which would also damage and scratch the DVDs. I'm a little upset because the season 9 pt 1 disk set is set up so different to avoid this kind of good.

Either way, worth watching. But from other reviewers and myself, there's the potential that you'll end up with a box full of plastic pieces.",1432252800,,728,4.237410071942446

6397901,3,B00K0S2RZI,"I enjoy Ghost Hunters but I've had the same problem with these DVDs since season one. There is a VERY strong smell that never goes away, in spite of the fact that I remove the discs from their packaging and store them in a DVD storage book. The plastic package itself is the most foul bit but the discs have retained the stench. Every time I unzip the book the smell fills the room again. It smells toxic and it makes me nauseous. I haven't seen this mentioned in other reviews but it's hard to believe I'm the only one who has noticed it. I have nothing but sympathy for the poor people who work in the factory that produces these stink bombs.

The other problem I've had with EVERY ONE of these DVDs is that the packaging breaks at the point where the discs are held in place. This results in scratched discs that don't play through. TAPS should be ashamed to have their names attached to such a crummy product! From now on I intend to buy the streaming format instead. The seller offered to accept my return but I decided to keep it instead. It didn't seem fair to make the seller absorb the cost when I fully expected these problems to occur.

The show itself is still fun, although the ambient music gets more annoying every season. I wish they'd drop it and allow us to fully experience these amazing locations without the added noise. This is the only so-called ghost hunting show I will watch and the reason is simple - debunking! As long as they attempt to disprove any questionable phenomena, I will keep tuning in.

P.S. - I still miss Grant Wilson.",1419897600,7,1560,4.391003460207613

6397910,3,B00K0S2RZI,"I have watched quite a number of episodes from various series of this show and something has always bothered me. Is there any logical reason why ghosts should have to be hunted in the dark?

Humans are active during the day. We don't have the night vision of cats, echo location of bats or amazing sense of touch of raccoons. We are relatively helpless at night unless we have artificial light. In fact, that's why so many of us are afraid of the dark- because we aren't equipped to handle it. We go to sleep at night.

So why would ghosts apparently manifest themselves at night? Is there a rational basis for conducting these ghost hunts at night, or is it purely because the show is just a TV version of a fairground haunted house, designed to play on our inherited fear of the dark? I love haunted houses, but they have nothing to do with ghosts.

I'd love to hear a justification for something which to me seems totally illogical- unless the whole thing is just a bit of fun. As a bit of fun, it rates 3 stars. As a genuine attempt to investigate ghosts, it seems to me the lights need to be turned on.",1415923200,2,1107,4.3125

6397916,4,B00K0S2RZI,"I just finished watching Season 9, Part 2, received today.  It did arrive with the little plastic centre damaged and I could hear the discs partying with each other inside.  Upon opening, 2 of the 4 dvds had alot of marks on them but surprisingly they still played so all is well in that aspect.

I started watching Disc 2 as it was the one with the most marks.  Maybe it was the recording equipment, I don't know, but I couldn't hear alot of the EVPs that they caught on most the episodes.  Ya know how they caption (voices) or (noise) or (footsteps) etc on the bottom of the screen upon playback? I've never had a problem hearing what they heard but this time, I could not hear or see 97% of what they heard or saw, even getting right up to the TV.

Now Hyde Hall on Disc 1 was good, all was normal on my end - some REALLY good evidence was caught.

It was very irritating when I couldn't hear or see what, to them, was obviously a wonderful capture.  I've not come across this before with any GH dvds. Oh well, I may be the only one that has this problem on Part 2 anyway.
.
The locations were great and unusual, I enjoyed listening to all the history of each.  Even Jason's daughter was on some of the episodes and I really like her.  AND, there was more laughter and cutting up by the team which I'm glad of.  Jason even laughed!!

All in all, I love GH and their investigations on Part 2 were great but was miffed this time because of the lack of volume or whatever it was.  I'm not that old to have hearing and sight problems.  :o)",1413849600,3,1538,4.134680134680135

It was always said during the review of evidence, that if something is in doubt then dismiss it. Well during reveals not one person can make out anything.

Whether you're a skeptic or believer you'll enjoy seeing the gang both debunk and capture spectral evidence in a nice mix of locations (from Hollywood to the heartland, New England to the deep south).  Even the personal cases (private residences) had interesting histories this season.  Extras are slender but quality; best bonus scene is ""Tango Takes the Stair Chair"".  *One star subtracted because the DVDs are packaged in flimsy cases.  My DVD case arrived in its own bubble-wrapped envelope, but the moment I lifted the envelope I heard a rattling noise inside; yes, as usual, the plastic center prongs meant to hold the DVDs in place had shattered even before arrival at the purchaser's home.  The bottom of Disc 4 was scratched due to sliding against the shards of shattered plastic, but, luckily, the disc still plays.  GH DVD packaging typically arrives broken or shattered in some manner.

The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that Amazon shipped this DVD in the same box as six tins of herring (!), with very little cushion.  The DVD case was beat up and the disc holder was completely smashed.  The discs were just rattling around inside the case.  They appear to be okay, but gee, Amazon.  I expected better from you.  So my advice to anyone is to order this alone so that it comes in its own box!",1408147200,4,534,4.227722772277228
6397933,5,B00K0S2RZI,"I liked the locations and their new style is showing nicely.  I liked the investigations I'm seeing.  Amy is back and looks great!  However the sound still needs to be toned down.  On my dvd's there was malfunction on disc 1 episode 1 and disc 2 episodes 3 and 4 of which I couldn't even watch 4.  Hopefully disc's 3 and 4 will be okay.  Even so Season 9 Part 1 deserves a ""5""rating.

Update:  Disc's 3 and 4 played fine.  My own suggestion would be not to have ""deleted scenes"" at the end.  I would much prefer Bloopers or something else funny.  GH doesn't have many funny or humourous moments so when they do laugh or cut up it is refreshing.
