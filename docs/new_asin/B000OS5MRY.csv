8186441,5,B000OS5MRY,"I was barely 5 when my mother took me to see this film, completely in Russian with no subtitles.  It has haunted me ever since.  I thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  The color and the music were out of this world, even if the sound wasn't the best in the old wooden meeting hall where it was shown.  I have always wanted to see it again as an adult and I understand that it now has subtitles.  Amazon doesn't have it and doesn't know if they ever will have it.  Anyone know where I could get a copy?  I am familiar with the amazing carvings in malachite that the Russians did (do?) and I have some gorgeous Russian laquer boxes which remind me of the fairy tale quality of this film.",1330560000,,706,4.109489051094891
8186442,5,B000OS5MRY,"I first saw The Stone Flower in 1945.  It was a Russian film, a fairy tale and now has english subtitles.  I was about 9 years old.  I remembered it a while back and decided to track it down.  I was surprised to find that it received an award for color film.  My video store found it for me and I later ordered it from Amazon.  It is a charming tale, very Russian and unlike anything that has been produced in English.  I highly recommended it.",1326931200,,444,4.093023255813954
8186443,4,B000OS5MRY,"I must have been 5 or 6 years old when I first saw this sweet and touching 1946 film. My parents occasionally took me to see Soviet films at the Cameo Theater on 8th Ave. & 44th Street in Manhattan. My main memory of those occasions is the few seconds of archival footage of Lenin that preceded each film showing and the audience's ardent and respectful applause that followed those images. Of the feature films I saw in that period, the only one which remained in my memory was ""The Stone Flower,"" an enchanting and magical folk tale with dreamy color, breath-taking special effects and strikingly beautiful images of crystal-filled caves. While the film is presented as a story told to a group of children, it should be enjoyable to any but the most jaded adults. A film of this quality reminds us once again that the USSR was not solely a chamber of horrors but, as a consequence of its contradictory sociopolitical nature, also a source of artistic masterpieces.

The film seems to have survived the transfer to DVD reasonably successfully, except for the sporadic image darkening (hence my 4-star rating) which I have seen as well in more than a few transfers of this vintage. Fortunately, these defects are only momentary and quite bearable. Seeing this film again on DVD has allowed me to recapture a bit of my childhood. I am grateful to Serge (""dvd_from_serge"") for uniquely (in the U.S.) making this jewel available, at a reasonable price and with rapid delivery. Bravo, Serge!",1309305600,,1487,4.785992217898833
8186444,5,B000OS5MRY,"I first saw Russian ""Fairy Tales"" when I was stationed in Germany many years ago.  However - as is stated in the opening of this excellent film - this is NOT a fairy tale - but - a Folk Tale.  This will work for adults as well as for kids.  I strongly recommend viewing this - and - if you enjoy - adding to your collection.  I - for one - plan to research Russian titles available - and - to add to my collection.",1248739200,5,414,3.835294117647059
8186445,5,B000OS5MRY,"I read a list of Ptushko's movies today. 1939, The Golden Key. (The Tolstoy version of Pinocchio). 1946, Kamenniy Cvetok. Since he produced at fairly regular intervals, this was some gap. Why? One word says it all: war. After, he couldn't make movies, there was no film. I've heard that he made this one on film stolen/smuggled out of Germany!
Ptushko, the master of fantasy, well knew how much was asked of audiences in suspending disbelief. He also knew the fee: that it be embedded in reality. In every one of Ptushko's movies, the settings are authentic down to the last detail. Nothing is spared in researching costume and setting. This movie proves no exception. Short on money and materials, he nevertheless went all out for perfection, and got it. He takes us into a small isolated mining town at the turn of the last century. He shows us in this, a traditional tale from the Urals, the poverty, the abuse of workers, the greed of the rich landowners and the cruelty of those chosen to serve them. Danila grows up without a home or parents, subsisting as best he can. He has an artist's soul, loves nature, is simple and innocent of heart. As the story develops, he discovers his gift: an eye for carving not any stone but the malachite from which the copper is extracted. (Historic fact: Russian carvings in this stone are legendary. One of the bonuses of the movie is a display of malachite carvings from museums and galleries worldwide.)
Danila carves a flower - a gift from Katya, his sweetheart - which outdoes anything the old masons had ever produced. Deaf to praise, like a true artist he is not satisfied. To him it merely LOOKS like the flower. It does not capture the flower's essence. He will not rest until he finds out how to catch the fire.
Under Copper Mountain dwells a strange being, the living essence of the stone known by the locals as the Mistress of Copper Mountain. Of all her treasures, she most prizes her kamenniy cvetok, a flower of fire and stone. Hearing of it from the old carvers, Danila declares that he will never rise above himself until he has seen it. The Mistress appears to him and offers to show him the flower blooming, a rare event. He goes, so obsessed now by his need to fully realize his gift that he runs out on his wedding. Seeing the kamenniy cvetok bloom, he experiences a dramatic epiphany. Impassioned, he carves a likeness of it, catching the fire, all right. When he is done, he declares though as any true artist would, There is no pleasure in it. No one will ever see it. He demands to go home. The mistress tells him he must stay there forever and serve her. His long-abiding bride meanwhile sets out to find him.
Now: Do not take the Mistress as some evil cradle-snatcher. This does the story, its message, and her character a gross disservice. The Mistress watches Danila from his earliest years, Ptushko shows her doing just that. Appearing sometimes as that ancient folk symbol of magic and mystery, the newt, she  observes and knows his artist's soul. She fosters and encourages him, then draws him under the mountain to help crack open his potential. Lest we see still her as a conniving mortal, Ptushko shows her towering over Danila, in a (supposed) rage full fifteen feet high. We see her take her colors and appearance from the magnificent caverns through which we go, we see her waving her magical twig, but her true form is left to our imagination. Make no mistake, her apparent attempt to seduce Danila is a test of his integrity and commitment, both to his art and to his bride. In waking him, she has put her own treasures at risk. She has to be sure he will keep her secrets. Satisfied, she reunites the lovers, gives Katya a box of jewels which will put the pair beyond the reach of the greedy mine owner. Danila's gift? That he will keep all that he learned when he emerges from the mountain. Though not human, her loneliness comes through. She asks wistfully that he remember ""the stone girl.""
In all, a story of gifts and exploiters and mentors and of the agony and, oh boy, the ecstasy of creative struggle. Simply and powerfully told.",1225670400,11,4120,4.57510148849797
8186446,4,B000OS5MRY,"Coming in 1946,this was one of the earlier Alexander Ptushko cinematic adaptations of Russian folklore.  The story is about an obsessed artist who is spirited to the underworld by a supernatural deity.  He is seemingly trapped there forever, but still yearns to return to the village and the woman he loves.  The DVD is a beautiful Soviet restoration of this classic film, which was undertaken in the late 1990s.  In fact, the DVD's colors appear much stronger than the theatrical reissue prints which were playing art houses circa 2002.  There are some behind-the-scenes extras on the disc as well, produced by the Russian label Ruscico, which has released several other Ptushko films onto DVD as well (ILYA MUROMETS, SADKO, etc.).",1201737600,10,732,5.066666666666666
