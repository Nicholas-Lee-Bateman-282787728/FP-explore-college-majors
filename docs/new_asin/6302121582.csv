428637,5,6302121582,"In recent years, critics have tried to 'defend' Robert Altman and 'The Long Goodbye', suggesting that he wasn't trying to negate Chandler's Philip Marlowe after all, but showing how out of touch his values were in the corrupt 1970s.  But the whole point of Chandler's Philip Marlowe was that he was out of time, a knight in an era of gangsters and bent cops.  Marlowe was the first detective not central to, or with a purchase in, the society he operated in - no matter what victories he snatched, the rot would continue.  Marlowe's only way to remain central was to tell his own story - at least he could dominate that.
It is clearly Altman's intention not to show Marlowe's ananchronistic idealism (those shots where he's dwarfed, Canute-like, by the tide), but his irrelevance, extinction.  There is a complex play of reflections throughout that serves to turn Marlowe into a shadow, with no hope of dominating his life, never mind a plot in which he is permantly in the dark.  The climax is shocking, not because 'Marlowe would never do that', but because he is essentially killing himself, his double (see that opening sequence, and the punning on cats) admitting the impotence of his code.
A superlative film worthy of superlatives - best ever adaptation of a Chandler book; best film and performance of the 1970s.  The ingenious, anti-realistic variations on the theme song alone, matching the moving camera vortex, are the stuff of genius.",990144000,6,1447,4.861788617886178
428638,5,6302121582,"The Long Goodbye is vintage Altman. It ranks not only as one of his best works, but one of the best films of the 1970s. Ignore the negative comments, this is supposed to be an updating of Chandlers character Philip Marlowe to a more contemporary setting which was the whole point and Altman does it very cleverly in the most unexpected ways.  Elliot Gould truly shines in his interesting interpratation of Marlowe. Seemingly lacking the confidence  and self assurance of Humphrey Bogart ( ""It's Okay with Me""), Gould more than makes up by proving himself with his wit which remains firmly intact from how Chandler originally envisioned the character. It is truly a brilliant, understated performance and better than Altman and Gould's previous collaboration Mash. The film has many quirky touches from Altman with a terrific supporting cast of players including Sterling Hayden, Henry Gibson, Nina Van  Pallandt, Jim Bouton and director Mark Rydell. The stunning photography by Vilmos Zsigmond once again gives yet another Altman film a unique aesthetic look. It is severly diminish when cropped up in pan & scan as other reviewers have mentioned. The film begs for a proper transfer to widescreen. Let's pray MGM/ UA comes to their senses and stop releasing James Bond box sets while these masterworks continue to be neglected.",975369600,14,1328,5.08256880733945
428639,4,6302121582,"I was rather surprised at the other reviews I read here. The point of this movie is to take a ""retro"" detective like Philip Marlowe and put him, as a fish out of water, in (what was at the time contemporary) LA of the 70's. I wasn't entirely happy with Gould's performance (I think that time has shown that he was much less of an actor than he appeared to be in M.A.S.H., for example), but he's adequate. The supporting cast is very good, although I did get a little tired of Sterling Hayden. Anyway, the movie is an affectionate spoof of movies like ""The Big Sleep"", and while it's not a great film, if you like the genre and you like Altman, you'll like this one.
The ending is very funny, at least if you've been getting the joke as you go along.",971740800,,749,4.208333333333333
428640,1,6302121582,"Firstly Philip Marlowe is not a slob. He is  just detective of modest means. Chandler makes no mention of Marlowe being  particularly unkempt. That being so, it is an insult to both Chandler and  his legendary protagonist. In fact the word 'unkempt' is a gross  understatement. Marlowe is portrayed as a mumbling, slovenly pig. As if the  attack on Marlowe's personal hygiene wasn't enough, where did that irritating  cat come from?  Who cares what food it prefers? Even if these details are  deemed inconsequential, why is it that three separate directors entrusted  with bring Chandler's work to film feel the irresistible need to  ""update"" the setting. This movie and 1969's 'Marlowe' are  excruciatingly ""campy"" The third was Michael Winner's version of  ""The Big Sleep"" who chose to shift not only time period but the  country. Not only did the long goodbye tamper with the time and place of  the story but also with it's basic elements. Including the ending. Which  not only changes the murderer but also even the most basic fibers of  Marlowe's personality. Marlowe stands for justice and righteousness, not  for vengeance! As far as this film being 'butchered' on VHS, I wouldn't  know. What I do know is that letterbox or no letterbox this is an awful  film. The format in which it is presented would not have remedied the  grotesque problems with this film.....
  Since I wrote this review only 3 brave souls out of 20 (!) have found it helpful. As such, I'm losing little by editing it. In the first draft I called it an action movie. I realize now that it was a bad designation, ""The Long Goodbye"" is about as far from the typical action film as it can get. When I wrote that line I was thinking about the ending and how grossly out of character it was,even in comparison with the rest of the film. I was expecting Marlowe to squint his eyes and growl ""make my day"" before pulling the trigger. I felt the need to eliminate the ""action movie"" line because it gives my detractors reason to believe that I misinterpreted the film. Those who praise the film parrot the word 'revisionism.'Apparently, the film was meant to show that a detective with a moral code as rigid as Marlowe's is horribly out of place in 1970s America, he is a ""fish out of water"" or ""caught in a time warp"" What they fail to realize is that those descriptions fit Marlowe just as well in his own time. His moral code is akin to the code of chivalry. Hence his being called a knight by many scholars. This code certainly does not mesh well with the corruption and vice of the 1940s underworld. So, where exactly is this precious 'revisionism?'",967852800,20,2625,4.636363636363637

Robert Altman's noir pastiche, ""The Long Goodbye,"" is one of his funniest, most  engaging, and aesthetically magical films (with gorgeous night photography  of Los Angeles). Unfortunately, it is unwatchable on VHS. I rented it a few  years back, found the film incomprehensible, and initially assumed that  Altman's directorial work was poor. Then, I caught it in a repertory  theatre and recognized the problem.
This is a masterpiece, but it's  impossible to make any sense of the pan-n-scan video; as in his other films  (""McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"" ""The Player"") Altman takes  full advantage of widescreen, a technique that is impossible to capture on  a small television set. So do yourself a favor: avoid this video entirely,  and either see the picture in a repertory house or wait until the  distributors have enough sense to release it in letterbox.",964915200,16,951,5.032051282051282

428643,5,6302121582,"It's my favorite movie.  The Long Goodbye just works so well on so many levels.  Gould was perfect here as the loser who will not sell out and walks the mean streets of L.A. like a scruffy, chain smoking, angel.  The  end is perfect.  True Chandler fans will love it.  It fits the tone and  updates the time to the seventies.  His constant chain smoking and his cat  and his constant refrain, ""it's okay with me"" were all as funny  as hell to me.  The redemption at the end.  He's a stand up guy.  All the  supporting roles were perfect.  The musical theme of the movie plays all  the way through in different ways, the best being a mexican mariachi band  at a funeral.  It is Altman's best film and that is saying a lot.  Nina Van  Pallandt is the ultimate burned out Los Angeles blonde. The supporting  roles are all perfect.  Chandler would have loved this movie.

428754,4,6302121582,"Movie 8 of 1973 and 8 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.
Admittedly I have only attempted to see one Altman film and that was ""Gosford Park."" My whole life I have only left the theater 3 times (if not less) early due to the film being unwatchable. ""Gosford Park"" is one of those movies. I think this was due to hype. I had heard how incredible it was. It was nominated for best picture. Yet, It seemed unworthy of its accolades. I tried again a few months ago and again couldn't finish it. Needless to say I went into this one a bit skeptical. Now for the purposes of full disclosure I will say that I am a sucker for film noir as well as anything featuring a PI. So while I will be postured to give the movie an open eye I am also positioned to be very negative if it isn't done well. Well this was done well. Very well in fact. I'm not going to say it was never dull, it had a few moments that seemed slow and unnecessary but it was interesting enough to keep my attention. Altman can be hit or miss for me when it comes to his style. He seems to relish in the simple activities of life and weave the more critical aspects of the plot into this picture of general existence. In the beginning of ""The Long Goodbye"" we get an introduction to the world of the character by his relationship with his cat, neighbors, apartment, shopping run, etc. Somehow Altman does not bore you with this at all even though very little seemingly happens. Much was actually happening but that's spoiler territory. Then he might have a scene like a drunken shouting match where, honestly, I'm just kind of uninterested. Mostly I would say the film is successful as a picture and as a PI movie. A gem of the 70's so far as far as I'm concerned. Some other noteworthy elements: The humor of the film mostly hits and I found myself laughing frequently. There is frequent, poor ADR and it is very distracting. This could be a technological issue of the time. Finally, I hated the song ""The Long Goodbye"" and it plays way too often in the film. Honestly it could have been a great song and I wouldn't care, it needed less play time and different variable iterations didn't help. For people my age this is old hat anyway (think ""Gross Pointe Blank"" or ""Raising Arizona""). I'm not sure if this is the first time it was tried but it wouldn't matter, it simply plays too frequently and doesn't have any real purpose that I can perceive. Marrow's most memorable and final act seemed out of character to me and didn't play true. Altman had it in his contract that this moment would take place but I think it just became a pet scene in my opinion and I think there could have been much more interesting and consistent character actions for the end. That said Altman should be given credit for making a bold creative choice. This movie should be viewed, I really enjoyed it and will watch it again.
Pros
-Gould gives a decent performance and he's funny
-interesting mystery
-peppered with great moments and intrigue
-respectable ending
-cool cameo toward the end
-opening scene is a metaphor for an important relationship and that's very good story telling
Cons
-slow at times
-distracting ADR
-scratching my head about character motives at end
-theme song is terrible and played far too frequently
-almost all scenes with blood are pretty clearly fake",1497744000,3,3336,4.461538461538462

Set in Los Angeles and Malibu, the film's locations mirror the gaps between what the characters in the story say and what they do.  Director Robert Altman's genius starts his story at Philip Marlowe's (Gould) cheap LA apartment and follows the detective to a mansion on the beach in Malibu, following as Marlowe tries to solve a murder involving a friend.

If there were a great film version of The Long Goodbye I wouldn't care, and this would be an idiosyncratic take on a classic, they way they do weird versions of Shakespeare. But The Long Goodbye has never been filmed with the respect - and the male lead - it deserves. There are few  American contemporary actors who are masculine enough to play Marlowe. Following Bogart and Mitchum, can you imagine? Russell Crowe is probably the only one, and his American accents are not great. (see The Nice Guys, it's hilarious).

Sometimes a film can be an honorable failure. De Niro in The Last Tycoon is a good example. It just doesn't catch fire and no one is to blame. But Altman hated Chandler/Marlowe for reasons of his own that are incomprehensible to the rest of us.

The one I'm praying for, he's not quite old enough yet, is Tom Hardy. If you've heard his North England accent in ""Locke"" you know he can do anything with his voice.

Altman turns the image of the private eye upside down portraying Philip Marlowe as someone not quite clear as to what is going on. Unlike Bogart, who was in control, Altman's Marlowe is used by his friend, the police, and Mrs. Wade. In some respects Altman's Marlowe is similar to Holly Martins from The Third Man. Both characters are used by their friend, both are to a great extent clueless until the very end when they do what has to be done. Marlowe's act of violence was so out of character that when the film went into syndication in the 70s that the gunshot was edited out of the film. The last scene in the film with Elliott Gould walking past Nina Van Palandt is so similar to the Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli ending scene in the Third Man. I was an assistant manager at a movie theater when I was in college and we ran The Long Goodbye for three weeks at Christmas and since then I must have seen the film  40 times.

429075,5,6302121582,"As a Raymond Chandler fan, I was concerned that Robert Altman would do something foolish like the football players smoking pot in M.A.S.H.

It's updated to the then-current Seventies and, especially, gets the LA Seventies vibe exactly right. The Blu-ray is as crisp and clean as a 1973 Panavision/Technicolor film can be in digital. One or two comedy bits are questionable but overall well-acted with many familiar faces.

There is Altman's trademark moving camera and overlapping dialogue, working better than in most of his movies. The interesting use of the theme song in all its permutations (smooth jazz in the Mercedes, canned Muzak in the convenience store) is often overlooked.

There are two indelible performances--Sterling Hayden's bigger-than-life novelist, almost unique in movies (vastly different than General Ripper in Dr. Strangelove) and the film director Mark Rydell as the crimelord. I believe him to be one of the truly scary villains in movies, because of his unpredictability. And if you see him with a Coke bottle, duck!",1441411200,2,1233,5.094059405940594

429133,5,6302121582,"To get a sense of time and place, director Robert Altman experimented with The Long Goodbye. The film is not perfect by any means (questionable dialogue, questionable characters, etc.), but one thing is perfect - the location: Malibu, California. The location adds another dimension to the film. Dirty, corrupt, broken are all adjectives to describe the 1973 Southern California Philip Marlowe finds himself in. He, his scruples, and his morals belong to another generation, another age. Marlowe (played laconically by Elliot Gould) is in desperate need of a moral cleansing. Malibu provides the perfect scenario: far from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, the exclusive beachside community harbors barren sandy beaches, bordering a vast Pacific Ocean. There is a scene towards the end of the film, which is appropriately satisfying for viewers: Marlowe chases a broken man into the sea; we cannot see his face; the sea is rough and unrelenting, pounding Marlowe as he attempts to save the man; maybe a man not worth saving. In these critical moments, we the viewers, realize the man Marlowe chases into the waves is a version of himself. Marlowe realizes this is not 1943, but 1973. It took virtual death and a whole lot of pounding before Marlowe emerges from the surf with a cynical truth. Altman knows Malibu (he lived there for decades), he knows the power of location. Malibu never looked so sexy, dangerous, and inviting.  While he nailed the location and themes, Altman is hit-or-miss elsewhere in the film, such as acting and cinematography. Elliot Gould is very good as Marlowe and interprets the role beautifully; Sterling Hayden is always a pleasure to watch; he is especially bombastic as a Hemingway-esque writer (Balls, Baby!); Henry Gibson also plays a great weasel; and final accolades go to Danish actress Nina Van Pallandt who comes out of nowhere to score as the femme fatal  - Altman saw her on Johnny Carson and liked her for the part. The Terry Lennox character is essential, but still a drag; and too much time is devoted to the Marty Augustine character (a fun, but overly-talkative, unnecessary storyline). The cinematography is great 95% of the time, but cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond sometimes gets too cute and distracts viewers. Again, The Long Goodbye is an experimental film with an almost art-house status at the time. Today it is a classic of Hollywood's Second Golden Age - the 1970s and, unlike Marlowe, the film greets the coming ages well.",1432339200,2,2483,5.024271844660194

429198,3,6302121582,"3 1/2 stars -- Robert Altman's 1973 free fantasia on the Raymond Chandler novel of the 1940's is stylishly carried out, but it's not very engaging.  The conceit of a '40's-style PI trying to solve a case in the 1970's is a cute one, and it's fun to hear Altman talk about it on one of the ""Special Features"" included with this DVD, but the movie itself generates more charm than heat, even with the two violent surprises that (I understand) were not in the novel.  The charm is Elliot Gould's, who plays Philip Marlowe -- his manner of speech, the predictable chain-smoking, the way he walks and moves are all distinctive and work to set him apart, as does his dark suit and tie, from the rich sunlit Malibu in which the movie is set.  There are many scenes that are visually striking -- the one involving Marlowe and Eileen Wade (Nina van Pallandt) in the sea is perhaps the most striking, both for its place in the plot and for the odd distance from which it is shot, giving it a strange balletic quality.  The opening scene with the cat is a charmer, and the scenes involving Roger Wade (Sterling Hayden) are the ones that come closest to being humanly interesting.

The plot involves the murder of the wife of Terry Lennox (Jim Bouton), a friend of Marlowe's, whom Marlowe helps escape to Mexico because he believes that he is innocent.  Soon after, he learns that Terry has taken his own life.  Meanwhile the gangster Marty Augustine (Mark Rydell), who had been owed about half-a-million dollars by Terry, comes down heavily on Marlowe, who, he assumes, must know where the money is or how to get it.  Altman tries for a blend of comedy and shock in the presentation of Augustine and his heavies, and some of it is effective.  What's less effective is the way in which Marlowe figures out what happened to Terry's wife and the way in which Marty gets his money back.  The plot logic necessary to make all that clear is not fully articulated, as Altman features style and local mood over dramatic clarity.  Van Pallandt, I have to say, is not the most persuasive of actresses, and Jim Bouton as Terry is pretty bland, but Gould, Rydell, and Hayden, in different modes, are fine, and Henry Gibson has a nice cameo as a creepy psychiatrist.  All in all, though, I would have liked a little more heart.",1428105600,,2303,4.52289156626506

His detective is a post-hippie slacker in a suit, who roams the big empty in search of who knows what.  I don't know.  I love most of Altman's films, especially some of the obscure ones such as Thieves Like Us, but The Long Goodbye is down in the dustbin of history for me along with Popeye.

Altman's notion of ""Rip Van Marlow"" doesn't work in practice because Gould isn't playing a 40's character who finds himself in the late 60's. The gimmick of having him mumble constantly, perhaps meant to update the traditional noir device of the detective's voice-over, doesn't work either. The acting is odd to put it mildly. I don't know how Altman directs his actors (are they adlibbing all of it, some of it, none of it?) but based on his other films that work a lot better than this one, maybe there are ""Altman actors"" like there were ""Ford actors."" Anyway, this cast doesn't cut it. And of course it's not the book. You seldom find a film that is really faithful to the book it's based on. (But see ""The Maltese Falcon"" for one that is.)

As with everything Altman did, he tackled the film noir genre in his own unique way. Altman had a string of critical and commerical successes which added to his confidence with ""The Long Goodbye"".

Those expecting Chandler's novel should adjust their expectatons.

Shot by Vilmos Zsigmond,""The Long Goodbye"" looks pretty good in its Blu-ray debut. Keep in mind that the softness evident in the image was intended. ""The Long Goodbye"" will never be a demo disc but it looks exactly as it was intended to look for a 1970's film. Colors, although muted, look quite nice and detail is pretty good although a bit more care in the transfer or a better source might have helped with better grain management (more consistent grain). There is also a bit of video noise in a couple of shots but, again, while this is not a perfect transfer it looks pretty decent given the source.

The audio isn't the best but, again, it's a typical Altman soup of merged voices and background sounds. The audio sounds fine if you know what to expect from Altman.

The special features are solid if not spectacular. I honestly didn't expect anything here but we get the original promotional featurette ""Rip Van Marlowe"" which runs 24 minutes and perfectly describes Altman's approach to the material.

Vilmos Zsigmond appears in a 14 minute interview where he discusses working with Altman, the film and his general approach to the material.

We also get a copy of the original American Cinematographer article, radio ads and the trailer.

I am a bit disappointed that we didn't get a commentary track or a new featurette on Altman and shooting the film but it's nice that we got anything for a catalog release. Kinko Lorber does a fine job with this release. ""The Long Goodbye"" doesn't look or sound perfect but it was never meant to.

Stars Elliott Gould as Philip Marlowe, and features Sterling Hayden, Nina van Pallandt, Jim Bouton and Mark Rydell. Screenplay by Leigh Brackett, after a story by Raymond Chandler. Produced by Elliott Kastner, Jerry Bick. Music by
John Williams. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Editing by Lou Lombardo. Distributed by United Artists.

Plot (from Wikipedia): Late one night, private investigator Philip Marlowe is visited by his close friend, Terry Lennox, who asks for a lift from Los Angeles to the CaliforniaMexico border at Tijuana. He obliges. On returning home, Marlowe is met by two police department detectives, who accuse Lennox of having murdered his rich wife, Sylvia. Marlowe refuses to give them any information, so they arrest him. After three days in jail, the police release him, because Lennox committed suicide in Mexico. It is an open-and-shut case to the police and the press, but the ""official facts"" do not sit right with Marlowe.

In the meantime, Marlowe is hired by Eileen Wade, the platinum-blonde trophy wife of Roger Wade, an alcoholic novelist with writers' block, whose macho, Hemingway-like persona is proving self-destructive. She asks that Marlowe find her husband, who, despite such regular alcoholic binges and days-long disappearances from their Malibu home, now seems to be missing. In the course of investigating Mrs. Wade's missing-husband case  visiting the sub-culture of ""private"" detoxification clinics for rich alcoholics and drug addicts  Marlowe learns that the Wades ""knew"" the Lennoxes socially. He is increasingly convinced that there is more to Terry's suicide and the murder of Sylvia.

Marlowe incurs the wrath of ruthless gangster Marty Augustine, who wants money returned that Lennox owed him. Augustine viciously injures his own mistress just to demonstrate what could happen to Marlowe, saying: ""That's someone I love. You, I don't even like."" The return of Augustine's money in the nick of time frees Marlowe to take a second trip to Mexico, where he ultimately uncovers the truth of what happened between Terry and Sylvia Lennox. endquote

Most Altman movies, I must see three times before I really know who-is-who. The long goodbye, comparatively, has only a skeleton staff, so one viewing is enough, but true to Altman, you this time must see the film three times to get the plot right  thats why above, I quote in full the very pertinent summary of Wikipedia. But the film is worth at least three viewings, anyway: It has  superb directing, acting, photography, cutting and music.

again Wikipedia: While the Chandler original  has been adopted for the late forties The Long Goodbye satirizes the changes in culture between the 1950s, when the private detective genre was popular, and the 1970s, when the film was released; a making-of featurette on the DVD is entitled ""Rip van Marlowe, to emphasize the contrast between Marlowe's anachronistically 50s behavior with the film's 1970s setting. Marlowe's chain-smoking, contrasted with a health-conscious California in which no one else in the movie smokes, is cited as another example of Marlowe's incongruity with his surroundings. endquote

Not unlike Polanskis Chinatown and the Nicholson follow-up Two Jakes, this is a Los Angeles movie to the bone, catching well its spread out character, the Freeways, downtown, Malibu beach, Wilshire Boulevard and some few scenic spots, private detoxification clinics for drug abusers and much more. And lots of human debris, jetsam and flotsam of any age, gender, and colour (mix), often on the mental edge, including a brutal Mex-Cal extortionist gang, a mix of people only Altman knows how to handle and (inter)act. The police, as in all of his films, are inlaws (as against outlaws). Elliott Gould, brilliant, as Philip Marlowe is unlike any other filmed Marlowe so far, and shows once more the possible range of Marlowe as a literary character.

The story starts with a man sleeping on a bed until a cat jumps up to awaken him. He lights a cigarette. [The beginning is drawn out.] Philip Marlowe's friend Terry Lennox asks for a ride to Tiajuana; he had another fight with his wife Sylvia. The next morning two police detectives come to question Philip, then arrest him. He is photographed and fingerprinted. [Was he drunk?] The lieutenant tells him he was arrested as an accessory to murder! What does he really know about Terry? After three days in jail he is released. Terry Lennox is dead, the case is closed. A man offers him a ride home, and talks about Terry. Nobody claimed the body. Next he takes a missing person case and visits a gated community. [Is that a 1930s Lincoln?] Mrs. Roger Wade has a pet dog. She covers up for her husband, a drinker who has to dry out at a sanatorium.

Marlowe locates the sanatorium where Roger Wade is being held. ""I'm here to help you."" Marlowe takes Roger home, he doesn't feel well. Roger can't write anymore. Eileen Wade believes what the newspaper said about Terry. Some men meet Marlowe and take him back to his rooms. ""Find it."" Marty Augustin tells Marlowe that Terry stole $355 thousand from him! ""Find my money."" Marty shows he is cruel. Philip follows Marty to a home in that gated community and sees him talk. Later Marlowe returns to Wades. Roger and Eileen talk to each other. Then Roger talks to Philip. [The story drags here.] Roger says Marty owes him $50,000. [Believable?] Philip gets a letter from Terry, it has a picture of James Madison ($5,000). Philip goes to Mexico to investigate Terry's death. There is a funeral march in the street. Philip finds the Wades there. Dr. Varinger is there to collect his fees. [The story drags again.] Philip drives home with Roger and Eileen.

Roger walks into the ocean. Can they save him? The police investigate. Philip asks Eileen if Roger could have killed Sylvia Lennox. The police know all the facts about Roger; he had an alibi at Dr. Varinger's sanitarium. Philip questions this alibi. [The story drags again.] Later Philip visits Marty and tells him he hasn't found the money. Joanna is there. Marty acts crazy again, and threatens Philip with mayhem. But a package arrives to end this threat, like a deus ex machina ending. Marty got his money back and he's happy. (He has to pay off people.) Philip sees Eileen drive by and follows her car with its custom license plate. A minor accident puts Philip in the hospital. When he looks for Eileen he finds she moved away. Next he returns to Mexico to investigate Terry's death. He walks down a long road and finds a solution to the mysteries. There is a shocking and surprising ending. [Was this a parody of ""The Third Man""?]

Why do second-rate writers think they can improve on the writings of first-rate writers? However clever, a parody isn't the equal of an original mystery novel. This movie is too serious to be a comedy, and too funny for a murder mystery. I suspect this confusion made it a commercial failure. The movie runs on too long. It has language that can't be broadcast, situations that were changed from the novel (not Raymond Chandler's greatest work). Was that old bearded writer meant to resemble Hemingway? He killed himself after psychiatric treatment. ""The Third Man"" was a better story about a premature death notice.",1386201600,2,3383,4.661641541038526

429444,3,6302121582,"While I can appreciate the director's effort to take a fresh approach to the Long Goodbye, I only found this film mildly entertaining. To be fair, I look at the movie in two ways: does it tell the original story, and if not, does the director still deliver an entertaining film.
For those who have actually read the entire book, this movie leaves out substantial portions of the early chapters and subsequent plot and subplot development which establishes Marlowe's  relationship to Terry Lennox; Terry Lennox's identity and relationship to Sylvia Lennox (wife), Eileen Wade, and the gangsters. Additional characters are left out entirely. So they have changed key elements of the story : who did what to whom. Not uncommon in Hollywood adaptations, but in this case it hollows out much of the original story, and makes one wonder why they use the original story at all(aside from obvious marketing reasons).
Top it off with a substantially different ending that is supposed to shock, but will more likely disappoint many Chandler fans. So if you are looking for a close resemblance to the original plot and story, forget it.

However, many reviewers have pointed out, it was never Mr. Altman's intention to simply follow the book as closely as possible; and the movie stands on its own as a retelling  of the Long Goodbye in a contemporary LA and Malibu setting. Altman claims he wanted to take a rip van winkle approach to Marlowe, figuratively a man from the 40s who wakes up in the 70s. So we get Elliot Gould driving a post-war car, wearing a suit and tie, and using those old strike-anywhere matches to light his cigarettes. But despite these contrivances, I did not get any feeling that Gould's character was a man from the 40s or even a detective, either as parody or quirky anti-hero. What Gould's Marlowe is supposed to portray is unclear to me other than an oddball constantly mumbling to himself... or uttering inanities like the scene with Eileen Wade after the suicide of Roger. I was a teenager when this movie was released, and certainly the anything goes feel of the 70s (as Gould's Marlowe says, ""it's ok with me"")comes through pretty clear. So Altman captured the 70s ""zeitgeist"". But none of these characters seem to have any substance or are likeable, including Marlowe. (maybe that is the director's point??)And the plot has been whittled down into a simple crime of passion over marital infidelity, leaving out the complexities of the original story; and what ties the main characters together and why we should care about them.

When asked why the movie was a box-office failure, Altman claimed the film was marketed as a detective story, but in reality was a satire. But I don't think the movie does very well as a satire either.  Certainly some of the characters are a little cartoonish: the gangsters, law enforcement, and even Roger Wade, but nothing seems to fit together for a coherent whole(Sterling Hayden as Roger is boffo and Nina Van Pallandt as Eileen is playing it straight, Henry Gibson as Dr Verringer is playing I don't know what, especially with the slap to Roger Wade.)The ""surprise""  ending is more Dirty Harry than Philip Marlowe, and if there is some point about violence in this ending, I am not sure what it is. Maybe when confronted with a weak, aimless screenplay throw in some gratuitous violence.

I did enjoy the cinematography (shots of Malibu and Mexico  particularly) and being reminded of the goofiness of the early 70s, from the bad clothes to the bad haircuts,for both men and women. But all in all, not  much to do with the original Marlowe. An Altman melange that does not quite amount to anything.",1383091200,2,3658,4.812101910828026
429445,5,6302121582,"You know from the start of ""The Long Goodbye"" that this isn't just another movie about Philip Marlowe as played by the earlier Marlowes (Bogart, James Caan, James Garner, Robert Mitchum, etc ...). Elliott Gould's Marlowe isn't particularly witty, contemptuous, or rude. In fact, he's quite the opposite. He's goofy, considerate to a fault, and downright boyish.

You see this from the cold open. The first image is a tin-art impression of Hollywood hanging on the wall of a dimly lit room, and the first sound is a tinny version of ""Hooray for Hollywood"" playing on the soundtrack, two elements that suggest we're in the 1950s, though we quickly learn otherwise. The camera pans right and you enter a meager bedroom to find Philip Marlowe asleep, fully clothed atop the covers at 3 a.m. with the lights on. The wall above the bed is blank, but marked with odd black streaks, like claw marks, and there's a restless cat trying to wake the sleeping private eye. Eventually it succeeds by jumping onto Marlowe's chest. And what does Marlowe do when he wakes? He strikes a kitchen match on the wall to light a cigarette. So much for the mystery of the black claw marks on the wall. And yes, it could still be the 1950s. Now Marlowe's in the kitchen, and the nameless cat is hungry, but there's no cat food in the apartment. Of course, Marlowe accepts that it's his duty to feed this cat, so he goes down to the local 24-hour market, where the late-night cashier not only knows his name but makes a point of telling Marlowe he left his car lights on. All-night market? This is not 1950. Clearly we're in the 1970s now, though Marlowe is always dressed for the earlier era -- a white dress shirt with a black tie, black coat and black slacks. Much to Marlowe's disappointment, the store's out of his cat's favorite brand -- Coury brand cat food -- so Marlowe tries to dupe the cat. He buys another brand, but once he's home, he spoons the food into an empty Coury-brand can, as if the cat can read the label. Regardless, the cat doesn't fall for it. It jumps on Marlowe's shoulder, claws him and runs out the hole in the wall marked ""el porto del gato"" (the cat door).

This sets us up for a wonderful, if somewhat confusing, journey with Philip Marlowe through 1973's Los Angeles. The story is not perfect. There are problems that some viewers will not easily forgive. For example, some elements of the story are unclear -- such as the whereabouts of a bag of money for most of the film. I've seen the film a dozen times and I still can't answer that question. Then there's the matter of the adaptation. Director Robert Altman and screenwriter Leigh Brackett have taken great liberties in bringing this Raymond Chandler novel to the screen. For instance, a murder in the book becomes a suicide in the movie. Not to mention, of course, that Chandler never portrayed his private eye on the page as such a fallible creature. But for those who are willing look beyond such changes and imperfections, there's a sense of wonder and joy that surrounds this vision of Philip Marlowe from start to finish.

It's not the best example of film noir, but I can't imagine that Altman ever expected it to be. Rather, this is Altman's idea of film noir, an interpretation of the genre that mixes in quirkiness, impulsivity and fallibility.

It's hard to say much more without giving away important elements of the story. The joy I felt in seeing this movie for the first time was not knowing what to expect at any point. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes Altman, to fans of Elliott Gould, and especially to those who love movies made in the 1970s.",1381276800,,3637,4.57361963190184
429446,5,6302121582,"To be honest, the first time I saw Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"", I was bewildered by the juxtaposition of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe against the film's 1970's-California sensibilities. But upon my third or fourth viewing I realized that Elliott Gould's performance had single handedly made this one of my favorite films. I LOVE Elliott Gould, and in this film he OWNS the character of Philip Marlowe. I have nothing against Bogart, but for me Elliott Gould IS Philip Marlowe! He is a delight to watch in ""The Long Goodbye"".

The film features strong performances throughout (including one very strange gangster and a guard who does a startlingly good  Barbara Stanwyck), excellent cinematography, a great score (don't be surprised if you can't get the theme out of your head!), yet another fine Leigh Brackett screenplay (though quite different from Raymond Chandler's book) and an early role for the tabby who would go on to fame as Morris the Cat.

Now I'm left bewildered by the fact that with so many movies that have little to nothing to recommend, this wonderful film is out of print! Thank heavens I was able to score an excellent used copy at Amazon. Highly recommended.",1381104000,3,1191,4.945
429447,5,6302121582,"Elliot Gould fits - like no other actor at this moment- as the perfect anti-hero, the private-eye who is hired to find a missing husband, is threatened by a Jewish hoodlum (an hysterical Mark Rydell whose character seems to be apprppriated decades later by Joe Pesci) and must journey to Mexico to see what's going on with all this messy state of things.

There are several smart clues around this original and stylish film. First at all,  Marlowe has lost a cat and he is mistakenly named Mr. Katz; the violent scene on Ann Jo seems to be rescued by Polanski in Chinatown (Nicholson with the broken nose); the girls in nude yoga reflect the spirit of that age of peace and love, and unforgettable sequences such as the guard's imitations of old movie stars and fascinating Marlowe's old car are part of an entertaing yarn that will catch you from start to finish.

It's useless to remark Gould was never better in no other movie, this is his best role on screen. The photography and clever direction of the caustic Altman make the rest.

And then we get to the John Williams/Johnny Mercer penned score ""The Long Goodbye"",  which permeates the entire movie, from the opening score, to a grocery store to even a doorbell. Magnificent and will leave you humming this song for days to come.

Altman knew what we must also know - it was the best choice. Gould was a real contender, just not much of a tough guy. In The Long Goodbye, Marlowe talks to himself. He has a cat. He is literally smoking a cigarette every second of the film. He always wears a suit, but not the kind you'd see in 1973. He's not the kind of PI you'd see in 1973. He stands for loyalty and friendship, unlike the rest of the LA types who populate the film. He's out to solve the mystery, but will that do justice for anyone? Will he be able to live with the truth?

 Altman took some chances on making The Long Goodbye (namely the eponymous song being heard in various forms throughout the film). But it's a must-see for fans of Chandler adaptations involving Phillip Marlowe. It's also a must-see for fans of Gould who know him for more than Mr. Geller on Friends (RIP Gould).

I gave the film three stars only because of the originality of the film techniques, not because I really liked it. Gould is good in what he wants to do, but as another commentator mentioned, his chain smoking really began to get on my nerves not long into the film. IMHO, that's really overdoing a prop.

I suppose at the end of the day one might find it interesting if you've never read the book and aren't looking for a more or less faithful rendition in the film. They could have just renamed the film and characters and made a movie without any reference to Chandler and nobody would have recognized it. In a way I felt that they were really using the Chandler reference to help plug the movie. Read the book. It's not only substantially different, even at its most important points, but it's also far, far more more interesting and complex. There's none of the book's flavor in this film. Oh, and Gould's Marlowe is virtually nothing the like Chandler's.

So, again, if you've never read the book, or read it and don't remember it, it won't bother you. You might even like it, as many others claim they have. However, if you're a Chandler fan, you'll probably be disappoined, maybe even find it a betrayal. Just remember, it ain't Chandler.",1356220800,2,1440,4.49236641221374
429553,1,6302121582,"This was a dreadful abomination and had absolutely nothing to do with Raymond Chandler's novel. Nothing. This was't good cinema nor film-noir nor any derivation thereof -- and putting Altman's name on a turd, doesn't make it any less a turd today as it did then when it came out.

This movie was like someone cutting through a tasteless, thick hulk of badly treated ham in slow motion and taking a total of 112 minutes to do so. Awful, just awful. I cannot believe that Chandler's Estate ever let this happen.

Everything about this movie is different from the book and actually, completely off-course and in many places plain made up. The only thing in resemblance to the book are the names. Marlowe, Lennox, Wade, Verringer, etc.

Elliot Gould constantly smoking cigarettes and having to light them with a match from every random surface was ridiculous. The 500th usage of Marlowe's name is used like a hammer on the ears of the viewer without care or consideration. Watching Arnold Schwarzenegger drop trou to show off a nub in his yellow speedos was probably the real low point, but by that time during the movie, so many low points had been achieved it was getting difficult to keep track.

And the bearded writer, Roger Wade? Really? Altman couldn't see fit to do *any* research at all? Raymond Chandler stated that the character of the writer was a reflection of how he felt about himself at the time in his dealings with Hollywood and was a rough spot in his life that dogged him. This stuff is easy to discover. So why must Altman reshape him into someone else, like Hemingway? I wanted to vomit on tinfoil somewhere and turn off the light.

Also, how many times must we hear the first two bars of the theme song with the lyrics? Yes, two bars. Not three bars or four bars. Two bars. They kept playing that portion of the song as if it was cool -- and It wasn't. Even the doorbell to Roger Wade's house chimed the same tune. They played several different versions and it was a novel concept, but poorly executed in the editing and incredibly overwrought. Dear lord!

I love Raymond Chandler, but I'm no purist. The filmmaking here was amateurish and ham-handed. The script writing was awful and fell flat. The acting was like watching mouth-breathers commingle with their clothes on. If you removed everything you knew about Raymond Chandler, his books, Humphrey Bogart, The Big Sleep film -- all of it, this movie would still come off as badly contrived and conceived as it is.

The gangster Marty Augustine is also an inspired take on Mendy Menendez. In places, he's a superior take. The famous Coke bottle scene is much more cruel and violent than anything in the book, but the build-up incorporates almost all the dialogue from the source material. Mendy's bragging fits perfectly into Marty's psychotic talkativeness. The impulsive way in which he commands his subordinates to take off their shirts builds naturally on Mendy's self-absorption, and it creates an even more compelling portrait of a friendly-talking sociopath with a fondness for philosophical conversation.

The problem, unfortunately, is that Altman doesn't understand what motivates Marlowe. He doesn't understand Marlowe's sense of friendship or honour. He does understand cruelty, which is why Marty is such a great invention. He also understands betrayal, which is why Eileen Wade is still a superb femme fatale. To some degree, he understands Roger Wade's whiny depression. But he doesn't get Marlowe at all, so he turns Chandler's meditation on lost friendship into a simplistic revenge story.

First of all, in the book, Marlowe's unwillingness to cooperate with the police is actually a pretty big commitment. He gets badly beaten by an overzealous cop, and narrowly escapes criminal charges. Everyone understands that he made a substantial sacrifice, which is why people like the journalist or the literary agent start to open up to him. In the movie, he spends a few days in jail, smoking and talking to his grumpy cellmate. They take his fingerprints and he gets ink all over his hands, and it really seems like an inconvenience rather than a serious jam.

Second, the book spends some time setting up Marlowe's friendship with Terry. It started when Marlowe perceived Terry's loneliness and sympathized. He tried to reach out to someone who, in some way, was like himself. Here, it is not clear how or why they know each other. I guess they're supposed to be poker buddies or something, but that is not enough to explain why Marlowe would want to help this person, or why he would be so bitterly disappointed that his trust was misplaced.

Third, Altman doesn't understand Terry either, and makes him into a smirking narcissist. The sad part of the book wasn't that Terry betrayed Marlowe's trust, it's that he knew full well that his own conduct was dishonourable, and suffered from the knowledge, but was too morally weak to do anything about it. In the movie, it's not clear why Terry, as he is shown, would even bother to send the portrait of Madison.

Fourth, Altman's final resolution of the conflict is just plain dumb, suggesting that he doesn't understand how there might be any way to react to betrayal other than violent revenge. When, in the book, Marlowe finally writes Terry off as dead, it has a devastating effect, because you know he's right, and you know that Terry knows that he's right. There is no need for violence -- Marlowe's cold statement, ""That was two other fellows, it seemed to me"" is sufficiently irreversible.

You could say that Altman's treatment of Marlowe is ""ironic,"" but that just confirms that he is out of his depth. There is nothing ironic about Chandler, and there shouldn't be. Marlowe's defining qualities are his ability to see through lies and his profound moral disgust for betrayal and dishonesty. He is not a vigilante in a bat suit. Marlowe illustrates the idea that, even if you are powerless to change the course of events, you can still maintain an unbreakable judgment of them. The whole point of Marlowe is that sometimes what you do has real consequences and determines who you are, and you have no way to ironically dance away from your actions. Terry has connections to organized crime and knows how to deal with violence, but he has no way to deal with the contempt of an honest man. To the director, this concept is incomprehensible.",1350518400,17,4810,5.230869001297017
429555,5,6302121582,"I saw ""The Long Goodbye"" when it appeared in the theaters in 1973, and I was impressed with it then, and the memory of its main events has stayed with me for all these years. So, I thought it was time to dust it off and give it a serious viewing and review. Unlike some other older movies about which I had fond memories, this ""The Long Goodbye"" did not lose its charm after 40 years.

The first thing I recall is that in spite of the fact that this may be Elliot Gould's best performance outside of the film M*A*S*H, I think the stars of the film are director Altman, cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond, screenwriter, Leigh Brackett, (relatively unknown at the time) composer John Williams, and a strong nod to the presence of actor Sterling Hayden. They all contribute to the image of a character from New York City the '40s transplanted to Malibu in the '70s. Gould's Philip Marlowe is the film noir gumshoe, but he lacks all the panache of the famous earlier actors who filled that role such as Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum. He has certain skills, but none of the clever competence of the greatest of film noir detectives, Jake Giddes in ""Chinatown"", who has a nose for incongruities and the talent to hunt them down. Gould's Marlowe seems buffeted about by both the police (with whom Giddes has a respectable relation), who also seem to be caught in Brackett's time warp (no cool Joe Fridays here)and the hoods, lead by a gangster, Marty Augustine, who does seem to have made the transition from 40s hood to 70s wise guy. Situations with both get resolved behind Marlowe's back, and Marlowe has no clue to how that happened.

Although Altman may not do it quite as often as Woody Allen, I suspect in this movie he was intentionally copying some of the conventions of ""film noir"", and making fun of them just a bit. Almost all the interesting stuff seems to happen at night, or in closed rooms where you can't see the daylight. The song, credited to John Williams, sounds just like something which may have been written for an early John Houston film or the film ""Laura"" which had a famous theme covered by lots of major jazz performers. It seems so utterly not California for Gould's Marlowe to always wear a suit jacket and tie, when all the other characters are dressed as you would expect in 1970s LA. Just as the ending to ""Chinatown"" is a surprise which I never saw coming, the end to ""The Long Goodbye"" succeeds in the same way.

What seems so puzzling is that there are three different plot lines early in the movie, all of which are connected by nothing except the common location, a gated, exclusive colony of residences on the beach in Malibu. The three plots seem to have nothing connecting them until the last 15 minutes. One benefit of this disconnect is that we can appreciate the role of Sterling Hayden, who, I am convinced, is patterned after the last years of Earnest Hemingway. This and his appearance in ""Dr. Strangelove"" may be his two most memorable film appearances. However, his appearance here is a nice reminder that Hayden began his career in some notable film noir classics such as ""The Asphalt Jungle"".

The showpiece of Gould's performance is the first 10 minutes, where he is virtually the only speaking character, who does a monologue for the benefit of his cat. Here is were all his anomalies begin, as he puts on a tie to go out to a 24 hour supermarket to buy cat food at 3 AM.

According to Wikipedia, the film was not well received at first, but, as I said at the outset, I was immediately impressed by it when I saw it in the theatre. It has one of the prime qualities of a film worth buying. It is rewatchable, maybe once a year or so. The next time I watch it, I would be especially attentive to whether there are early clues which tie the three plot lines together.

By the way, even though his role is uncredited, you can't miss Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of the gangster's ""muscle"". David Carradine also has an uncredited role, but he is less easy to spot.",1345161600,7,4010,4.516528925619835
429556,1,6302121582,"script corrupts Chandler's story entirely - having just watched it for the 1st time after re-reading the novel, I feel as though the barest skeleton of the story was unearthed, crushed, restructured, then, for promotional purposes only, the principal characters and title were retained - dreadfully abusive

also, discontinuity in the narrative suggests that the audience already knows the original but is willing to accept the corrupted narrative for whatever reason, who knows what... in homage to the director's presumed genius? - even the BBC radio dramatization (available on Youtube) is far better - check for yourself - [...]

429557,3,6302121582,"As is often the case, this isn't the film I remember.  Elliot Gould stars as an irritatingly chain-smoking Phillip Marlowe who is far removed from the Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum versions.  Both Bogie and Mitchum narrated part of their film.  Gould just mumbles to himself.  For the most part Gould's Marlowe is a less than savvy, weak sister of a private eye.  This is my biggest issue with the film.

Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Robert Altman, Marlowe is drawn into a case involving the suspected murder committed by his best friend Terry (played by former baseball player and author Jim Bouton).  Terry shows up at his door late one night and asks Marlowe to drive him to Tijuana.  He does, but is subsequently interrogated by the police as they suspect Terry killed his wife.  Terry then commits suicide in Mexico and case closed, right?  Not so fast.

Marlowe is also hired by a rich wife of an author who may be mentally ill.  The author played by Sterling Hayden is the best character in the movie.  He has disappeared and the wife wants Marlowe to find him.  The wife is played by beautiful Danish actress Nina Van Pallandt whose acting career was overshadowed by her liaison with the Howard Hughes hoax author, Clifford Irving.  But that's another movie.

There are other complications that weave their way into the plot.  A mobster chief (played by Mark Rydell who usually directs) is also on Marlowe's case because he thinks he has money owed to him by Terry.  Watch for a hood played by muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger (uncredited).  While Gould's version of Marlowe allows him to crack wise too often for his own good, his take on the character isn't what Raymond Chandler would have liked.",1322784000,2,1713,4.76530612244898

First of all, I bought it because I'm reading Chandler's book and wanted to see his cool dialogue spoken on the screen.  The movie had almost none of Chandler's unique, special dialogue:  no similes, no quips, no short talk.  The plot only thinly followed the book and left out the best parts.  The movie was so dark (dimly lit) that you could hardly see what was happening most of the time and not at all some of the time.  The speaking was muted and garbled so you couldn't follow the dialogue.  Call me a low-brow, but I thought it was awful.  A tremendous disappointment.

I am a Philip Marlowe appreciator and have searched out quite a few of the various versions and actors who have played this facinating character. Gould's is one of the most unique versions in this Altman take on Raymond Chandler. Altman brings the best out of this plot of human frailties and shares a glimpse into 70's California using the sleepy eyes of the Rip Van Winkle like Marlowe of Elliot Gould. This is both classic Robert Altman and Philip Marlowe. I highly reccommend it.,1288051200,2,574,4.476190476190476

A lot of it is quite funny and entertaining, but there's a sad, almost tragic side under all the hip irony.  The ending is powerful, if a bit rushed.  I'd put this among Altman's best films, but as I said, it took a second look to get there.

429592,5,6302121582,"Robert Altman, the great American film director, made 35 feature films. The Long Goodbye, based on a Raymond Chandler detective story, was one that I saw for the first time. The film was filmed in Los Angeles in 1973,but he places it in 1950s LA when the book was written. It stars Elliott Gould, an actor who was on the black list of the Hollywood studios for failing to complete his latest film, as Philip Marlowe. The studio system was alive and well in 1973, but Altman worked largely outside that system. Rather than insisting that his own vision always prevail, Altman gave great freedom to the actors and photographers he hired. As a result, actors and other creative people loved to work for him and sometimes worked for free.
Don't miss the special features on this DVD, which give great insight into Altman's modus operandi.
In a previous review, I compared Altman's approach to making films with that of Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick's films are all excellent, but you always know that you are watching a Kubrick film. Altman's films are unique in that they also reflect the varied viewpoints of the actors and others making the film.",1272931200,,1140,4.762626262626263
429593,3,6302121582,"Robert Altman talks in the added material about his intention of attracting a particular audience for this twenty-years-later reworking of a Chandler classic, probably the subtlest and most complex of his novels. I wonder what sort of audience he had in mind?

To a contemporary audience, the incessant chain-smoking of Gould, even when running (come on!), is only the beginning of the put-off. The plot has been emptied of meaning, and its resolution depends on an unexplained major event which saves the hero from another kind of fate worse than death. And the final act is contrary to all Chandler's character-building. Gould is passable, Nina van Pallandt is credible, as is Sterling Hayden. The camera work is well done, and the pace is slow only at the beginning.

The trouble with filming any of Chandler's novels is that they have complex plots. A lot has to go to make them fit the time available, and you then miss the meanings, the layers and the unfolding.

I'm glad I watched it, but I don't think Chandler would have approved at all.",1272844800,3,1047,4.805555555555555
429594,5,6302121582,"It has taken me many years to come around to ""The Long Goodbye"". For one thing, I was scared off by all of the bad press surrounding Leigh Brackett's alterations to Ramond Chandler's novel. And, for anyone who is already familiar with the novel, how you respond to these alterations will very much be your own personal reaction - there's no denying that. Chandler tended to write rather subtle, inconclusive, or enigmatic endings. Brackett clearly knew that, which is why Hollywood asked her to make the endings to both ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Long Goodbye"", more cinematically friendly in the first place. But unlike ""The Big Sleep"", where one is still left wondering who did what to whom (and when), there's absolutely no question here as to what happened and why. In fact, if anything, the conclusion to this movie version of ""T.L.G."" is sort of a precursor to the very shocking ending we see in ""Prizzi's Honor"" - the main attraction of that shabby little shocker. In other words, the story and its narrative is as air-tight as anyone could possibly want it to be. But don't get me wrong, I still think that ""The Big Sleep"" is one of the greatest noirs of all time.

No, what made me pick up ""T.L.G."" was something else altogether; something unexpected: the theme music. The music was composed by John Williams and Johnny Mercer. I stumbled across a Youtube excerpt, and there was my jazz hero, Jack Sheldon, singing the movie's theme song. That alone made me want to get this (I collect most everything with J.S.). But, just as with the more famous movie ""Laura"", the theme song gets sounded throughout the entire picture. However, unlike ""Laura"", ""The Long Goodbye"" - that's the name of the tune as well - goes through many different styles and permutations during the course of the film. As a result, the movie doesn't feel like it's just an advertisement for a possible radio hit.

The best example of this is in the first of two scenes filmed down in Mexico. Marlowe (Elliott Gould) is trying to get information from the village authorities as to how and when his friend, Terry, allegedly died down there. During the course of their somewhat bizarre discussions, a poor sounding village band plays ""T.L.G."" tune while accompanying a funeral cortege through the town's cobbled streets. Then we immediately segue to a party scene back at the Malibu Beach home of Mr. and Mrs. Wade, where a few revelers who are crowding around a modest upright piano, crank out a sort of fast, bossa nova rendition of the same tune - almost Brazil '66 like. The juxtaposition of these two scenes and two styles couldn't possibly be more stark and dramatic. It's almost as though the theme song is used as a Wagnerian leitmotif throughout this film.

As for Marlowe himself, I think Elliott Gould is brilliant. Much has been made of Altman's ""Rip Van Marlowe"" approach - a Marlowe who wakes up in a far more indifferent 1970s. Marlowe doesn't know the D.A. here, and the L.A. Police are completely indifferent to him. If anything, he's just a nuissance. They regard him as though he were a doctor who's just a quack. This time, Marlowe has no friends downtown. His credentials mean nothing. But that also permits Marlowe to be more freelance than ever. He's now able to think fully for himself, and is better able to make quick assessments of the situation. This pays off in the end, as Marlowe still clings to his 1940's, good world/bad world values. Given that fact, it's all the more relevant that Mr. Wade - Sterling Hayden - keeps referring to Marlowe as ""Marlboro"", or ""The Marlboro Man"" (to his wife).

And, of course, the scenes with Elliott Gould and Sterling Hayden are quite famous for Hayden's quick witted, turn-on-a-dime improvisations. He plays a burned out writer who has turned to the bottle in hopes finding some further inspiration - a tired cliche' if there every was one. But Hayden twists this hackneyed theme to his advantage: he's totally over-the-top in the best tradition of the excessive 1970s. These scenes alone are worth the price of admission.

All in all, for whatever faults it may possess, there's also an awful lot going for this 1970s, ""Rip Van Marlowe"" rendition of ""The Long Goodbye"" (""it's a loooong goodbye,  .  .  and it happens everyday"").",1271289600,3,4271,4.7466307277628035

The 70s LA sets are interesting for their period decor. I wondered where Marlow lived because his building is quite scenic, though the naked yoga girls next door are simply annoying.

Simply put, this movie is extremely boring.  The pacing is painfully slow.  Example:  it begins with Elliott Gould waking up and feeding his cat.  This is about the first 4 minutes.  Nothing happens.  Without giving the plot away (to the extent there is one), we soon see Elliott Gould at the police station.  Again, boring.  It looks like it was a lot of stoned actors ad libbing.  I hope no one actually wrote this stuff.  But again, boring.  Still barely anything happening with the story.  Some might say modern movies are too fast.  But there are plenty of great movies from the 30s, 40s, 70s, etc., that don't drag like this.  ""Casablanca,"" ""Chinatown"" (released a year after this), all quickly bring you into the story.  The fact that this is 30+ years old is no excuse.  I stopped watching this movie twice it was so mediocre.  First after 30 minutes, then again 30 minutes later.  The only reason I finally watched the entire thing was to see Sterling Hayden.  He was great as a drunk writer, but his performance did not justify sitting through the movie.

But you say you like Robert Altman?  Maybe you've seen ""The Player,"" or ""Gosford Park"" and are hoping for something as good?  You will be sorely disappointed.  I guess watching this might be educational, in that you could see how a director that has made some amazing movies also can make something very bad.  But personally, I'm not masochistic enough to consciously set out to do that.

And Raymond Chandler fans beware.  I'm currently reading all of his short stories and novels, and was interested in what the early 1970s take on Chandler would be.  It was insulting, really.  This is not anywhere near the Philip Marlowe character that Chandler created.  This Marlowe whines.  And whines.  And gets pushed and slapped around.  The real Marlowe never whined.  He got slapped around, but he slapped back.  Maybe the idea is that he was on downers.  That might explain things.  But this is not Raymond Chandler's creation.

To sum up, buying this was a complete waste of money, but if I had obtained it for free, I would STILL be here writing this, warning others off.  If you like Chandler and hard-boiled detectives, you would be much better off watching ANY Rockford Files episode.  In fact, the weakest episode of the Rockford Files is heads and shoulders above this.  And if you want the best of this genre from the 70s, watch ""Chinatown.""  But this?  It should be buried and forgotten.",1201392000,20,2716,4.632911392405063

Check out a very young ""Arnold"" as well as Ross' and Rachel's dad when he was the hippest Jew in Hollywood. This is classic noir. Gangsters, molls, drunk writers, bad cops, and Marlow.

429656,4,6302121582,"Phillip Marlowe, Raymond Chandler's classic noir hard-boiled private detective forever literarily associated with Los Angeles and its means streets is right at home here in his search, at the request of a friend, for the inevitable `missing woman' (`dame' for the non-politically correct types) who 'conveniently' turns up dead. There is plenty of sparse but functional dialogue, physical action and a couple of plot twists, particularly around the identity of the above-mentioned `dame' and the motives behind the involvement of various wealthy Californians.

Have no fear however the intrepid Marlowe will figure it out in the end and some kind of 'rough' justice will prevail. At this point in the Chandler Marlowe series our shamus has been around the block more than a few times but he still is punching away at the 'bad guys' and the absurdity of the modern world. How does this one compare with the other Marlowe volumes? Give me those background oil derricks churning out the wealth while looking for General Sternwood's Rusty Regan in Big Sleep or the run down stucco flats in some shady places in pursuit of Moose's Velma in Farewell, My Lovely any day. Nevertheless, as always with Chandler, you get high literature in a plebeian package.

There have been many cinematic Phillip Marlowes from Bogart and Powell to Elliot Gould in this Altman production. They reflect their director's take on the times and on the character of Marlowe himself. The world-weary but virtuous Marlowe of the 1940's has been replaced in this film by a decidedly out-of-tune Marlowe who could realistically be arrested for vagrancy any minute in the up-scale and upward striving Los Angeles of 'new' California. Fortunately Robert Altman can make it work without being too syrupy. In other less capable hands, and with an actor other than Elliot Gould who sets the standard for all modern Marlowes (except probably the chain-smoking) giving his all to the role, that is an iffy proposition. In any case the days of Chandler's, Cain's and Hammett's intrepid California characters are long gone. But, thankfully, at least not on film. This one will join that crowd.",1182297600,,2151,5.073446327683616
429657,5,6302121582,"This is a superb adaptation of Raymond Chandlers famous story. Elliot Gould, in his best ever role, is perfectly cast as private detective Philip Marlowe. The opening scenes alone warrant purchase of this disc. In the early hours of the morning Marlowe has to get his cat the right food. This is funny and introduces you nicely to the slovenly Marlowe.

It helps that the films is directed by one of the great American filmmakers Robert Altman, who also directed M.A.S.H., Nashville and The Player. Sterling Hayden is fantastic as Wade, a scary Hemingway like writer with violent and depressive tendencies.

I have watched this film quite a few times now and have never noticed a problem with the transfer quality (mentioned in one review I saw). An essential movie for any film collection.",1180396800,,790,4.888059701492537
429732,4,6302121582,"Robert Altman's career essentially began with 1970's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MASH/dp/B00005N96E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MASH</a>,"" and a mere three years later Altman had already established an ecclectic bunch of films, including his reimagining of the western genre, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McCabe-Mrs-Miller/dp/B000063K2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McCabe & Mrs. Miller</a>,"" and his stab at horror, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Images/dp/B00009Y3NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Images</a>.""  Altman next set out to revitalize the long-dormant film noir with an adaptation of Raymond Chandler's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Long-Goodbye/dp/0394757688/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Long Goodbye</a>,"" a Philip Marlowe mystery.  Marlowe had previously been portrayed by the likes of Dick Powell in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-My-Sweet/dp/B000244EX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder, My Sweet</a>"" and most memorably by Humphrey Bogart in Howard Hawks' ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Sleep/dp/B000FFJYA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Sleep</a>,"" which Bogey starred in opposite wife Lauren Bacall.

For his Philip Marlowe, Altman made a choice only he could have made: Elliott Gould, who had previously appeared as the rambunctious ""Trapper"" John McIntyre in ""MASH.""  Needless to say, it was a curious decision, but one that - for this film at least - works and works well.  Gould's Marlowe is unlike any other.  He's considerably more upbeat his predecessors, and he talks to himself almost incessently.  He lacks the cool and the confidence one expects in the role, and he lets himself get pushed around without putting up a fight.  He is also dedicated to one thing and one thing alone: his cat.  But for Altman's film, a convoluted, surreal neo-noir, Gould is perfect.  His performance captures the displacement and nostalgia a person like Marlowe feels living in the 1970s (Altman updated the setting from Chandler's novel, which was set in the 1950s).  While the other characters have big hair and leisure suits and baggy pants, Gould walks around in an old-fashioned suit and drives around in an automobile that can't have been manufactured after the 1950s.  Altman stated that while he was envisioning the film, he nicknamed his Marlowe ""Rip van Marlowe.""  The name fits.

The supporting cast includes Nina van Pallandt as the mysterious Eileen Wade, who does better in her role than any big-name actress could, as well as Sterling Hayden, who roars and grumbles like an angry bear as alcoholic writer Roger Wade.  Henry Gibson is the sleazy, odd Dr. Verringer, and Jim Bouton is the obnoxiously cheery and foolish Terry Lennox.  Young Arnold Schwarzenegger also appears toward the end of the film as an enormous bodyguard for Mark Rydell's ratty mobster.

One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that it was written by Leigh Brackett, who also co-wrote the screenplay for Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"" (although reportedly Robert Altman made numerous changes to the script, something he's rather infamous for doing).  ""The Big Sleep"" remains the best and one of the most faithful adaptations of a Chandler novel, but Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"" has little in common with its brilliant source material.  The complex plot of the book has been trimmed down to a thread, and a frequently incomprehensible thread at that.  By the end of the film, we have at least a loose grasp of what has happened.  And though the film's shock ending will no doubt infuriate fans of Chandler's work, it's a major part of what makes Altman's film so unique.

In the end, that's exactly what ""The Long Goodbye"" is: not a Chandler adaptation, nor a Philip Marlowe mystery, but a Robert Altman film.  Altman is the real star of the film.  He's often been occused of focusing more on what the film looks like than what the film is about, and if ever there was a film in which Altman was guilty of that, it's this one.  He's more focused on making a shady noir film and not focused enough on crafting an intriguing mystery to go along with it (the intriguing mystery, if there is one, is just what the hell is going on).  That's enough to make ""The Long Goodbye"" float, though, through Altman's tight angles, the murky photography, Gould's neurotic performance, and the theme song by a young John Williams, which appears in different variations at a number of points in the film (it's also the only music in the movie).  Despite its flaws, ""The Long Goodbye"" had enough points of brilliance to earn it classic status, and interestingly enough, it accomplished Altman's goal of revitalizing the noir genre, paving the way for films like Roman Polanski's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chinatown/dp/B000022TSH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chinatown</a>"" and Arthur Penn's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Moves/dp/B0009GX1CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Moves</a>.""  It may not quite be a masterpiece, but as Marlowe says repeatedly, ""It's okay with me.""",1180137600,,5312,6.05607476635514
429733,5,6302121582,"""The Long Goodbye"" is based on Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name, reconceived by screenwriter Leigh Brackett and director Robert Altman, who displace the post-war P.I. Philip Marlowe to 1973, as if he had woken up from a 20-year sleep and found himself among the sun-kissed sybarites of then-modern Los Angeles. Terry Lennox (Jim Burton) implores his old friend Philip Marlowe (Elliot Gould) for a ride to Tijuana in the middle of the night. Terry's in some kind of trouble, so Marlowe obliges. Marlowe is arrested the next day on a trumped up charge by some cops who are sure he must know that Terry bludgeoned his wife to death. Marlowe is then hired by a Mrs. Eileen Wade (Nina von Pallandt), who lives in the same gated beachfront community as the Lennox's did, to find her eccentric alcoholic husband. And Marlowe is threatened by megalomaniac mobster Marty Augustine (Mark Rydell), whose $350,000 Terry made off with.

Marlowe can't escape the mystery of Terry Lennox. The case is pursuing him more than he is inclined to pursue it. Everyone thinks that Marlowe knows something about Terry that he doesn't. That sets the tone for ""The Long Goodbye"". In contrast to the conventional detective role, Philip Marlowe is the pursued, not the pursuer. He has no control, gets no respect, and has little choice but to investigate his friend's death. To add insult to injury, we're watching. Vilmos Zsigmond's constantly moving camera makes it creepily clear that we are voyeurs of Marlowe's troubles. That onus is a little uncomfortable at times. Robert Altman's focus on behavior adds detail and texture without overwhelming the story. His signature overlapping dialogue serves the chaotic moral climate well. Elliot Gould is fantastic man out of time, smoking and wearing dark suits in the Southern California heat. ""The Long Goodbye"" is a great neo-noir from that decade of emasculated noir protagonists, the 1970s, when private detectives became anachronisms.

The DVD (MGM 2002): There are 2 featurettes, a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), 5 radio ad spots (3 1/2 min, audio), and ""'American Cinematographer' Reprint of 1973 Article"" (text) by Edward Lipnick, from the March 1973 magazine.

""Rip Van Marlowe"" (25 min) features interviews from 2002 with Robert Altman and Elliot Gould.

""Vilmos Zsigmond Flashes The Long Goodbye"" (14 min) is a 2002 interview with cinematographer Zsigmond in which he discusses creating the visual aspect of the film with the production designer and Altman, night shooting, camera movement and ""flashing"" the film to achieve the desired effects.

429734,5,6302121582,"I admit, when I first viewed ""The Long Goodbye"", in 1973, I didn't like the film; the signature Altman touches (rambling storyline, cartoonish characters, dialog that fades in and out) seemed ill-suited to a hard-boiled detective movie, and Elliott Gould as Philip Marlowe? No WAY! Bogie had been perfect, Dick Powell, nearly as good, but ""M.A.S.H.'s"" 'Trapper John'? Too ethnic, too 'hip', too 'Altman'!

Well, seeing it again, nearly 34 years later, I now realize I was totally wrong! The film is brilliant, a carefully-crafted color Noir, with Gould truly remarkable as a man of morals in a period (the 1970s) lacking morality. Perhaps it isn't Raymond Chandler, but I don't think he'd have minded Altman's 'spin', at all!

In the first sequence of the film, Marlowe's cat wakes him to be fed; out of cat food, the detective drives to an all-night grocery, only to discover the cat's favorite brand is out of stock, so he attempts to fool the cat, emptying another brand into an empty can of 'her' food. The cat isn't fooled by the deception, however, and runs away, for good...

A simple scene, one I thought was simply Altman quirkiness, in '73...but, in fact, it neatly foreshadows the major theme of the film: betrayal by a friend, and the price. As events unfold, Marlowe would uncover treachery, a multitude of lies, and self-serving, amoral characters attempting to 'fool' him...with his resolution decisive, abrupt, and totally unexpected!

The casting is first-rate. Elliott Gould, Altman's only choice as Marlowe, actually works extremely well, BECAUSE he is against 'type'. Mumbling, bemused, a cigarette eternally between his lips, he gives the detective a blue-collar integrity that plays beautifully off the snobbish Malibu 'suspects'. And what an array of characters they are! From a grandiosely 'over-the-top' alcoholic writer (Sterling Hayden, in a role intended for Dan Blocker, who passed away, before filming began), to his sophisticated, long-suffering wife (Nina Van Pallandt), to a thuggish Jewish gangster attempting to be genteel (Mark Rydell), to a smug health guru (Henry Gibson), to Marlowe's cocky childhood buddy (Jim Bouton)...everyone has an agenda, and the detective must plow through all the deception, to uncover the truth.

There are a couple of notable cameos; Arnold Schwarzenegger, in only his second film, displays his massive physique, as a silent, mustached henchman; and David Carradine plays a philosophical cellmate, after Marlowe 'cracks wise' to the cops.

The film was a failure when released; Altman blamed poor marketing, with the studio promoting it as a 'traditional' detective flick, and audiences (including me) expecting a Bogart-like Marlowe. Time has, however, allowed the movie to succeed on it's own merits, and it is, today, considered a classic.

So please give the film a second look...You may discover a new favorite, in an old film!",1177286400,46,2899,5.234913793103448
429735,4,6302121582,"A youthful Elliot Gould at the top of his form makes for an easy-going yet no nonsense Phillip Marlowe in this contemporized (1973) adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name.

Gould's chain-smoking and cat-loving Marlowe is surrounded with typical 70s-circa Hollywood/Malibu characters including uninhibited hippie-chick neighbors, an assortment of thugs both criminal and badged, a controlling sanitarium administrator, and an alcohol-abusive novelist played by 50s star Sterling Hayden (Asphalt Jungle, Dr. Strangelove).  A very cool John Williams/Johnny Mercer musical score helps establish and sustain the film's mood which ends with a scene that's both controversial as well as provocative.  - DM",1176249600,,975,5.845070422535211
429736,3,6302121582,"Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye,"" released in 1973, based on Raymond Chandler's penultimate novel, is generally considered a film noir classic.  It follows Chandler's convoluted plot, kinda sorta, and is, of course, filmed in color: there's a school that says that movies based in Los Angeles, as this one is, may succeed as films noir despite being filmed in color.

Chandler's book was adapted for the screen by Leigh Brackett, who also did the honors for the 1946 Warner Brothers' Humphrey Bogart adaptation of the author's ""The Big Sleep.""  Here, the action is moved from Chandler's L.A. of the 1940's to the city's 1979's, mean, drug-addled.  After the murders committed by Charlie Manson's crew, and the motorcycling Hell's Angels at the Rolling Stones"" Altamont concert.  The city has begun to awake from its long dream of drugs, sex, and rock and roll.  The film's cinematography, by the talented Hungarian refugee  Vilmos Zsigmond, who also did Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" captures the look of the city frozen at that time.  Harsh sun, bleached colors, threatening pastels.  And Altman's camera moves constantly.  The many times honored John T. Williams did the sound track, and a witty one it is, too.  That theme song pops up all over the place, from supermarket Musack to Mexican, party singalong to piano jazz.

The story concerns Philip Marlowe's decision to help a friend.  Marlowe, here played by Elliott Gould, helps Terry Lennox (played by Jim Bouton) to get to Mexico.  Lennox will be accused of killing his wife and stealing a large sum of mob money. For his trouble, Marlowe is beaten up, and jailed for several days. Then, what is apparently another job takes him to a guarded, ritzy Malibu beach community, that is, in fact, the site of the murder of Lennox's wife.  The gatekeeper does movie star impersonations, nobody is actually the person he/she presents to the world, and several residents have taken screen star type names.  His clients on this job are Sterling Hayden, as an alcoholic, Hemingwayesque famous writer, Roger Wade, born Billy Joe Smith.  And Nina Van Pallandt, former model, and mistress to that most famous of 1970's hoaxers, author Clifford Irving (he counterfeited a Howard Hughes autobiography).  She plays Wade's downtrodden wife Eileen.

Altman was an offbeat kind of guy, and his casting of this movie is, too.  Most of the lead parts are played by non-actors: Van Pallandt; Jim Bouton, former New York Yankees star pitcher as Lennox, born Lenny Potts; Mark Rydell, producer-director, as psychotic gangster-gambler Marty Augustine.  Henry Gibson,stand-up comic from Rowan and Martin's television show ""Laugh In,"" as the oily Dr. Verringer.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, bodybuilder then, in an unbilled, hardly speaking part.  These people evidently do as they were directed to do, and deliver their lines, as does David Carradine in a bit, unbilled part as Marlowe's jail roommate.  But the leads, Elliott Gould and Sterling Hayden, must have been encouraged to improvise.  They talk constantly, and, in the Altman way, frequently at cross-purposes, to deliver what must surely have been the least disciplined performances of their careers.

Frankly, to watch the film again after a hiatus of several years, you can't help noticing that it's virtually two hours long.  And that these self-indulgent, undisciplined performances are annoying and tedious, two things a movie of a Raymond Chandler novel should never be.  Well, many Chandler books have been filmed more than once, so, with regrets, here's hoping Chandler has better luck next time.",1173657600,13,3599,5.1692573402417965
429737,3,6302121582,"""The Long Goodbye"" is director Robert Altman's take on the hardboiled crime fiction of Raymond Chandler and his most accomplished screenwriter, Leigh Brackett. It was an odd film when first released, the conceit being Philip Marlowe's taking a big sleep in the 1940s, only to awaken in Southern California in the 1970s. It's now an even odder film, since the 70s are long gone and make for a certain kind of period picture.

429738,5,6302121582,"Robert Altman at top form here delivers a revolutionary and breakthrough film that is still under-appreciated, perhaps because it is too easily tagged as updated film noir.  Say what you want about the Marlowe character and the Chandler novels -- it was all top flight pulp fiction, that's all, no matter how it fascinated the French and who started calling it noir.

The plot has been done 100,000 times -- cheap detective and unsolved crime, beautiful woman as alluring foil, and a host of red herrings, weirdos, suspects, crazies, all keeping you on edge until last cut.  And sure, Bogart nailed this particular character memorably in the author's own time, in a manner which could only have been done then.  But neither the text nor character are sancrosanct.  They were good available fodder to launch something more.

That something more is an extraordinary actuality, a gritty realism that captures BOTH southern California and the 1970s -- a time and a place -- as nothing else on record.  Watching the movie is uncanny, like entering a dream or a time warp.  It reminds you of the possibilities of cinema that still, with the art form not yet a century old, remain to be explored.  The wayward Gould is perfect, and he is perfectly used.  The great and under-rated Sterling Hayden delivers a vastly haunting performance, as a man from a whole other American time and place -- just as real as the one on camera but already gone -- leaving him a quite menacing fish out of water.  The music -- a lovely but endlessly repeated strain, finally becomes as stultifyingly hypnotizing as a mantra from the far east.  That plus a surrealistic camera drench you in the great big NOW -- yet combine to give the movie the patina of timelessness.  All the characters are caught in this gauzy vision as if in amber, specimens ever freshly packaged and delivered to us in all the weirdness and eccentricity of their time and place.  And finally, the master's touch -- using two non-actors for the key noir roles -- ""disgraced"" (just disgracefully honest, really) baseball pitcher turned author Jim Bouten as the baddie, and the mistress of then headlines maker Clifford Irving (forger of the notorious fake Howard Hughes autobiography) as the femme fatale.  It is as if Altman lifts these two, in the cucoons of their media noteriety of the day, and finds matching fictive wrappings to transport their enigmas fully intact to us and the unknown future.  That effect is incredible enough, but the undertow is how it ups the ante for what the seemingly hapless Gould character must do -- in his own way ripped out of time and place and thrown helpless into a strange and terrifying world.  You certainly wouldn't figure he would prevail.

Altman's unique gift is to orchestrate the talent, set all the balls in motion, then get out of the way, let others run downfield with his inspirations.  Far from being the sort of controlling director as Kubrick or Orson Welles, or for that matter Kurosawa or Bergman, Altman is true successor to the mantle of Nicholas Ray, maker of Rebel Without a Cause.  His enterprise exudes a democratic American confidence, but not shouting at you, either.  This film ranks as twin peak to his Nashville, his other best work.  All that, and the film is also funny as hell.  And finally more grimly serious than any classic noir,  as all moves to convulsive and unexpected conclusion. The difference from ordinary noir is that this take on the genre is not stylized.  It takes the plum out of the pulp fiction, so to speak, treats that little germ of truth in Raymond Chandler's noir world as seriously as any big truth in serious literature, something to be fully explored, developed, reckoned with.  When Marlowe walks away at the end he's no longer Marlowe, he's somebody you never met and hope you never do, a terrifying moment of revelation.",1172102400,3,3867,4.777443609022557

Additionally, the cinematography is terrible - it looks like a cheap 70's movie shot in video instead of film. There's absolutely no suspense, nor snappy delivery of lines by Gould. I can only imagine that anyone who liked this movie probably cared more about Marlowe's bare-topped neighbors than anything else, because there's almost nothing of redeeming value in this movie.

429782,5,6302121582,"Often overlooked, Robert Altman's 'The Long Goodbye' is arguably one of THE films exemplifying the 1970s and, although far less dark, ranks alongside Antonioni's 'The Passenger'.

Propelling Marlowe into the opulent, 'promise' of the west coast 1970s USA, Altman allows the story to unfold around a classic murder, mystery story and the stunning cast help to create an atmosphere of parochial 'goings-on' that can subsequently be seen in the works of David Lynch, Tarrantino and, more recently, the 'Sopranos'.  The late, great Sterling Hayden gives an unforgetable, bullying, volatile King Lear-like performance as the ageing, impotent, alcoholic writer, and Mark Rydell's 'dangerous' violent character anticipates that which Martin Scorsese and Joe Pesci create latterly in Goodfellas/Casino. Moreover, there's an uncredited cameo appearance of a moustachioed Arnold (Schwarzenneger) as a 'heavy'.

However its Elliiot's Gould's brilliant (Oscar deserving) performance as Philip Marlowe that helps to  seal this film's status into the canon of GREAT films.
Gould creates a sharp, amiable, chain-smoking, wise-cracking 70s detective whose 'quirky-alone' livestyle allow him the freedom to give his own Chandleresque, talking-to-himself dialogue (...'it's alright by me...') whilst interacting with a diverse range of characters within the narrative. With respect to this, there's the continual variation of the haunting melody, 'The Long Goodbye' that is re-worked throughout the film thus floating the narrative structure within changing and moving events and themes yet anchoring it to the overall thread of the story itself.

Altman's direction is that of a genius at work: the back-drop of the oceanic tug and wash of the tide as seen through the windows of the seductive though manipulative Eilleen Wade's windows (Nina Van Pallandt), together with slightly surreal and erotic appartment  setting of Marlowe's flat make this film unforgetable. There's also the tension associated with the 'journeys' to Mexico: a theme used in more recent (great) films including 'Lone Star'; 'Traffic'; and, 'The Three burials of Melquiades  Estrada'. Who can deny the impact of the opening 'cat' scene and the final 'chapter' of the film  set within the avenue of trees; the 'oh-too-late' figure of Eileen Wade heading in the opposite direction to Marlowe who ironically celebrates his parochial sense of closure by playing the minature harmonica.

 If ever a film rated as a '6' for special merit and sheer enjoyment then this is one of the elite few deserving of such an award! I urge you to watch or re-watch this film and savour a work of pure genius.

The opening cat scene is a dead giveaway that the director is out of touch with the story. Gould could have pulled off the Marlowe character, if there wasn't so much method acting, mumbling 70's, anti hero angst to his character. The fault lies at hands of Altman not Gould. The casting of Sterling Hayden was masterful, as was the cinematography, and the clever use of the theme song.

429785,4,6302121582,"Robert Altman's film of Raymond Chandler's THE LONG GOODBYE has been called one of the 1970's greatest films and a knockout by Pauline Kael, but Leonard Maltin only gives it a **1/2 (out of ****) and says its jokey approach to the mystery genre borders on contempt.  I have a fondness for it because I like both Los Angeles and Altman's movies.

Made in 1973, between the towering masterpieces McCABE AND MRS. MILLER (1971) and NASHVILLE (1975), GOODBYE at very least has one of the greatest opening scenes Altman has ever made.  It is 3:00 a.m. in West Los Angeles, and private eye Philip Marlowe (Elliot Gould) gets a wake up call from a cat who is hungry.  There is no cat food in his apartment, so he heads to an all night market.  He is stopped by strippers making marijuana brownies in a nearby apartment:  ""Oh, Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Marlowe, would you mind getting us some brownie mix?  We will save you some.""  ""Sure thing, girls,"" Marlowe calls back as he lights the fifth or sixth of about a thousand cigarettes he smokes during 112 minutes of movie.  Then at the market, Marlowe keeps muttering, ""Damned cat needs food.  It's  3:00 in the goddam morning, and my goddam cat needs food.""  As best I can tell,  he does remember to get the brownie mix for his friendly insomniac neighbors.  It is a fabulous sequence, backed by a stunning bluesy title song by John Williams and Johnny Mercer.  This is the city of lost souls and where no one really sleeps.

I don't remember any of this being in Chandler's 1953 novel, which is also set in 1953 and not 1973.  But I think it would amuse him.  What IS in the book, I am pretty sure, is the next sequence of scenes:  Marlowe drives friend Terry Lennox (Jim Boulton) to Tiajuana in the wee hours, then is interrogated by cops at dawn back at Marlowe's apartment.  It seems that Terry Lennox's  wife Sylvia has been murdered tonight.  Backed by a smokey jazz instrumental score by John Williams at his very best, this crime is at the heart of a novel I love.

But there is another crime:  missing person bureau.  An alcoholic writer (bearded Sterling Hayden) named Wade has vanished, seemingly to an exclusive Malibu Beach Colony apartment to be alone with his writing.  His wife (a fabulous and very beautiful Nina van Pallandt) wants him back.  The trail here leads to a sinister psychiatrist (an imaginatively cast Henry Gibson) and a hyperactive mob boss named Marty Augustine (Mark Rydell) as the two crimes are weaved together.  Mrs. Wade wants her husband back, and Augustine wants his mob money back.  Agustine certainly has psychotic methods of getting his way, including smashing a Coke bottle in his innocent mistress' face, leaving her a bloody pulp beyond anything in any GODFATHER film.  (An unfazed Kael ludicrously compares the horrible crime to Cagney smashing a grapefruit in mistress Mae Clarke's face in THE PUBLIC ENEMY.)  Augustine's next line is comic nasty and addressed to Marlowe:  ""Now that's someone I love.  You I don't even like.""  The crime almost derailed the last third of a very good movie for me.

In the last third of THE LONG GOODBYE, which is exquisitely photographed in Panavision by  the great Vilmos Zsigmond, we travel around different very fresh West Los Angeles spots I remember fondly from UCLA college days in 1973.  This is one of the great Los Angeles movies, as is another Altman masterpiece, SHORT CUTS (1993).  We solve the disappearance of Wade in an unforgettable visual poetry scene I don't want to spoil for you.  And we solve the murder of Sylvia Lennox and the puzzle of why Terry is hiding out...where he is hiding out.  A movie that opens with a jazzy instrumental rendition of ""Hooray For Hollywood"" ends with a scratchy vocal recording of that song as...something happens that I find satisfying while others have found controversial.

Does Marlowe get his brownies?  Does Elliott Gould still smoke like Bogart?  Except for Marty Augustine's savage temper (cover your face during the horrible Coke bottle scene), I really like what Robert Altman and credited writer Leigh Brackett have done to update a great Raymond Chandler novel.  It fondly evokes the Los Angeles I loved while a college student at UCLA in the early 1970's.  And the cast is impeccable. See THE LONG GOODBYE on widescreen DVD, then read the novel.  Or vice-versa.",1141430400,4,4341,4.74331550802139
429786,4,6302121582,"During a documentary extra on the DVD version of The Long Goodbye, director Robert Altman says they called Elliott Gould's version of Phillip Marlowe ""Rip Van Marlowe"" because it's like the iconic 1940's detective character fell asleep for 30 years and awoke in the 1970s.

True to form, the opening scene shows Marlowe being jolted out of a deep sleep. Gould plays Marlowe like he has stumbled out of hibernation and is completely baffled by everything going on around him. He does, however, take it with a 70's stoned indifference.

The film opens with interconnecting scenes between Phillip Marlowe and Terry Lennox (Jim Bouton). The soundtrack plays the same song through both scenes, but in completely different styles. Over Marlowe's scenes the music is soft and jazz like, while when Lennox is on screen it becomes more edgy, more rock influenced. It is a brilliant way to introduce characters and give us a sense of who they are.

This is not Howard Hawk's Raymond Chandler. Gone are the dark shadows, and production code of film noir. The sex and violence is no longer hidden under innuendo and suggestion. Here Marlowe's neighbors are drug ingesting nudists. This is Altman's subversion of a genre.

This is definitely a Robert Altman picture. There are plenty of trademark long shots, and overlapping dialogue. He is less interested in the Chandler story, than in a sense of style and the juxtaposition of classically moral 1930's detective in the amoral times of the swinging 1970s.

The story loosely follows Raymond Chandler's novel. Marlowe drives his friend, Lennox, to the Tijuana border only to return home to an apartment full of cops ready to arrest him for aiding and abetting Lennox, who is suspected of murdering his wife. Meanwhile Eileen Wade (Nina Van Pallandt) hires Marlowe to find her alcoholic husband who has disappeared. Between the cops and the missing husband Marlowe is accosted by local gangsters who want the money Lennox owes them. The three stories meet and interconnect in an ending that is vastly different from the novel.

There is a wonderful scene after the cops arrest Marlowe and are interrogating him. It begins as the standard interrogation scene with Marlowe in a small room being slapped around by tough cops, while others watch through a two way mirror. Altman invigorates the scene by inter-cutting the two rooms together. While the camera is in the interrogation room, the two way mirror is always in sight. When the scene moves into the outer room, we see through the mirror and can hear the Marlowe conversation as it overlaps with what the watching cops are saying.

Elliott Gould is brilliant as Phillip Marlowe. He seems completely amiss from his surroundings, oblivious to all the things going on all around him. He keeps the Chandler wisecracks going, but sends the tough guy gumshoe routine packing.

Though not a film for noir or even Chandler purists, it is a brilliant piece of cinema. In subverting a genre Altman has created a new kind of detective drama. One that is humorous, thrilling and cinematic.

429787,5,6302121582,"Robert Altman's "" The long goodbye "" is an outstanding film in many ways: for one side,due to the liquid treatment - visual promiscuity, uncentralization of the dramatic action and valuation of lateral details, smooth travellings combined with ""zoom"" effects and sudden focus changes - of its mesmerizing images and obsessive and haunting theme song (composed by Johnny Mercer), the dominant musical piece in the film but reinterpreted with different instruments and tones along the movie. Second, due the ""jazzistic"" treatment of a genre and a character - which connects with the intention to give many variations to a same musical piece - a character that as in many films of the director appears dissolved in a polyphonic structure - Raymond Carver is one of the favorite writers of Altman -; and finally, for the non-nostalgic revision of film noir conducting it to the free-wheeling spirit of the 70's and to a more democratic conception of a genre. Vaguely inspired in the novel with the same title by Raymond Chandler, Altman's film avoids the old narratives codes of film noir, like the use of an omniscient voice or narrator and chauvinism of the male detective: Marlowe (Elliott Gould)lives with his cat and the perfect neighbour for the ""crazy"" young girls who lives next door, and prefers humour and words to guns; he usually talks with a cigarette between his teeths or Altman's film Marlowe's back while he's talking, producing the effect of ""off-voice"" )a typical narrative support of the ""film noir "")cracking with the expresionist portrait, surrounded by shadows and lights, of the traditional ""antihero"" of the genre, at the same time as he uses Marlowe as counterbalance to emphasize critical vision of corruption.

429788,4,6302121582,"I saw this film as part of the Cal State Northridge Cinematheque Critics Series with a special visit from Pulitzer-Prize winning critic Joseph Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal. The evening was moderated by David Kipen of the San Francisco Chronicle, Morgenstern gave great insight into the industry while presenting one of his favorite films, Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye.

I enjoyed The Long Goodbye. I did not find it tedious at all, like a woman in the audience expressed, but can understand why someone might think it is. Although the film moved slowly, it remained interesting, partly because of its characters. It was a dark noir with an absorbing and complicated mystery and plenty of humor. I especially liked Mr. Gould's rendition of the popular noir detective.

Philip Marlowe has been played by the likes of Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum, and James Garner, all tremendous actors, but Elliott Gould gives the private eye a sort of stoner quality that fits perfectly into the 70's era. The Philip Marlowe of the 70's talks to himself and smokes way too much. He gets involved in a couple of cases, which all neatly come together at the end.

There's the central mystery of Marlowe's friend Terry Lennox, who may or may not have killed his wife. Marlowe is duped into driving him to Tijuana and when Lennox commits suicide, Marlowe is determined to figure out the truth. When his picture ends up in the paper, he is hired by a socialite named Eileen Wade to find her missing husband. Marlowe also gets into trouble with a gangster, who thinks he helped Lennox steal money from him. In one of the best, and most suspenseful, scenes in the film, the gangster smashes a coke bottle in his girlfriend's face to let Marlowe know he means business. Despite the mess he finds himself in, ""It's okay with me"" remains Marlowe's phrase of choice.

The mystery makes sense eventually with perhaps a too off the wall ending. Was it in Marlowe's nature to do what he did? Maybe, but no matter how stressed, tired, and betrayed he felt, there could have been a better way to handle the situation. I felt a bit suckered by the ending; not the climax, but Marlowe's actions in the resolution. It was too neat and perhaps a bit too unbelievable. I know plenty of people who might argue against me, but I stand by my opinion.

The other thing I didn't like about the film was the irritating title theme popping up in the most unusual places. It was okay at first, and in fact, had a nice little beat, but it got rather annoying hearing it in almost every scene. Were there no other songs around in the world of 1970's Philip Marlowe? Since the song had different reincarnations throughout, I'd think not.",1115424000,2,2706,4.688421052631579

Instead of a knight in shining armor they got a slob who smoked too much and talked to himself.  And they hated the ending:  Marlowe, they say, would never do anything like that.  I beg to differ.  His action at the end was shocking, yes, and perhaps it would never be done in ""real life""--but inconsistent with his character? Not at all.  Being a Chandler fan myself, I was quite disappointed with this picture when I first saw it, because I expected a literal interpretation of the story and didn't get one with Altman's innovative, challenging, and frequently jarring update.

429790,5,6302121582,"Many movie makers use to make good novel adaptions for the celluloid after previously having them converted into scripts that try to recreate the books' atmosphere. Altman, though, uses to take someone else's writings just to fit them into his personal satirical vision of corruption, lies and dishonesty inherent to us human beings, to set them, finally, into a brilliant suite of humor gags. The Long Goodbye is a special work of Altman -perhaps not as notorius as MASH, Short Cuts, The Player, etc.-, but here the satire and the black humor reach an unexpected zenith through a playwrite that is la crme de la crme...The main character -Philipp Marlowe- played by Elliot Gould, is one of the coolest and most hillarious detectives ever seen on screen. A chain-smoking curly-headed loser addicted to Marlboro cigarettes and witty wisecracking who seems to be more of that sort from the outside looking in, spins the fade of the action and meets the infamous bunch half amused and half horrorized, but never trusting anybody of them. An outsider-loner, so as Chandler figured out Marlowe in his novels and as Raymond Chandler self and the only one in possession of a bit of honesty and integrity, he tries to clear up the missing of a good friend and comes upon deeply rotten intrigues faded by stingy shrinks and a wife of wishy-washy reliability played by Danish baronessa Van Pallandt in one role out of her usual folky-hippy musical attempts of real life. Her husband, -a writer, stunnigly good played by Sterling Hayden-, delivers one of the dazzling perfomances. Meanwhile, Marlowe tries to fool his cat feeding him with the wrong brand that he dislikes -one of the most hillarious bits of the film, it takes at least five minutes-, getting to the supermarket, digging it and changing the label of the can. Other memorable moments follow, like the wanna-be-actor-chap of the parking ground impersonating Barbara Stanwyck or the Jewish gangster cracking a glas vase in his own girlfriend's face, stating: ""...And this is the person I love the most in the world, now go and figure out what could I do with you -and I don't even like you"". Marlowe's trip over the Mexican border turns out to be rather elucidating too. This is Altman at his best, pulling everybody to pieces, but contrary to his European counterpart Chabrol does -with the coldness and precission of a surgeon's scalpel- Altman gets to the conclusion that once the disgust's been got over, humor is the only weapon left to can stand up all the rotten things in this world.",1108771200,5,2543,4.861751152073733
429791,4,6302121582,"I really enjoyed the featurettes that came with the DVD, one with Altman and Elliott Gould, the other with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmund who discusses technical points that added to my apreciation of the movie.  It's one of the few movies from the hippie era that hasn't aged badly because the naked girls doing yoga on the balcony are as perplexing to Marlowe as they are to the viewer of today.  The female star, Nina Van Pallandt, who plays Eileen Wade is genius casting.  In fact the actor who plays Roger Wade, Eileen's husband, is also beautifully cast--Sterling Hayden.  One wonders what the film would have been like if Dan ""Hoss from Bonanza"" Blocker had played the part of Roger Wade.  In the featurette Altman reveals he nearly abandoned making the picture after Blocker's death, and he is listed in the credits in a weird sort of way.  But back to Hayden and Van Pallandt.  He is a man mountain with a big Lord of the Rings style beard, he could have played the Tree thing in Fellowship of the Ring.  he has a long monologue on the beach with a bottle of frozen aquavit that's fantastic as anything he did for Coppola or Kubrick.  And Nina Van Pallandt--who had been a kind of Danish folk singer and then one of the principals in the Howard Hughes/Clifford Irving forgery scandal of Ibiza--looks utterly gorgeous in the film, always wearing some ethnic hippie gown with sixty yards of material, always looking Scandinavian, with bogs of great sorrow in her dark eyes.  She should have won the Oscar--that's plain to see nowadays.  She's also great in Altman's A WEDDING as the drug-addled Mom.

And how many cigarettes does Elliott Gould smoke in this movie?  It's as if he has discovered a new brand of acting which involves expressing oneself solely through cigarettes.  No wonder Sterling Hayden calls him ""Marlboro Man.""

And the theme song is terrific, the lyrics, by Johnny Mercer, among Mercer's best.  Between Johnny Mercer'sa contribution and those of Sterling Hayden and Leigh Brackett, Altman garnered the best of the 1940s and brought it into the 1970s for a last hurrah.",1104451200,3,2097,4.783333333333333

The music for the film is a dozen or so different versions of ""the Long Goodbye"" everything from jazz to muzak to humming etc. Look for David Carradine and Arnold Schwarzenegger in bit roles.

Nashville (2 stars, don't shoot me film buffs!) Muddled and draggy though I love Carradine's song

429814,5,6302121582,"The screenplay (Leigh Brackett) of The Long Good-bye is unusually well thought out and coherent. For a private-eye movie, that's an exception, and I suspect it's that very tightness which forced the famously anarchic Altman into a  disciplined groove. It also helped produce this, his most accomplished, film. Then too, only an audacious film-maker of Altman's calibre could have brought such an irreverent approach to the screen.
Small wonder Chandler purists detest this 1960's version of Phillip Marlowe. Like others of that period, the film sets about subverting an icon of the popular culture. Elliot Gould's Marlowe is anything but the hard-boiled professional audiences have come to admire and expect. Instead, he's grubby, feckless, and seemingly too disengaged to care about Chandler's prized passion: chasing after truth despite an uncaring corrupt society. Worse, one suspects Gould's Marlowe is a hippie at heart, ready to chuck it all and head for the woods with his beloved cat, a load of pot, and a world-weary ""Its OK with me"". Moreover, he's tossed about by most every event that comes his way,  too burned-out to complete a thought and too bummed-out to press an investigation. He can't even find his cat. The slouching gait and hang-dog expression have all the assurance and verve of a man headed for a hanging.  Bogart's classic impersonation, it ain't.
But Altman has laid a trap, one that only comes into focus at film's end. It's a startling yet oddly believable turn of events. Head doctors term this type of reconfiguration Gestalt Shift, and here the shift is a rewarding one, causing us to go back and re-examine the Gould character and his passage through what has gone before. It's also a brilliant stroke which at last links the counter-cultural Marlowe to the classic version. There are many fine touches in the film, including a highly effective use of sudden violence, particularly runty Henry Gibson's slam-bang humbling of  lordly Sterling Hayden (he knows about drunks). And, for once, Altman's penchant for non-actors like Jim Bouton does little damage, although I wish the ending had skipped the ill-advised ""Hooray for Hollywood"". Nonetheless, this is one of the half dozen or so films that define counter-cultural film-making from the 60's. However, Its key Southern California ambience is best viewed, as other reviewers point out, in wide-screen. So catch up  with that mode if you can.",1088121600,5,2428,5.1367088607594935
429815,2,6302121582,"Been a long time fan of McCabe & Mrs. Miller, consider it one of the great films of the '70s, and bought the disc with pleasure. So last week I rented 3 Women based on the reviews of that film here and absolutely loved it; an incredibly surreal and strange film. So I ordered it, and then decided to explore a few other '70s Altman films. Based on those reviews I decided to add The Long Goodbye with my order of 3 Women, expecting that I would enjoy both. But I couldn't wait, so I rented The Long Goodbye too and watched it last night. Suffice it to say, I didn't like it, but fortunately the order hadn't shipped so I was able to cancel The Long Goodbye in time and will just receive 3 Women from that order.
What didn't I like? Well, the scene setups are very cliche. In one scene Marlow and Ellen Wade are talking by a window. Altman separates each on both sides of the frame with the ocean behind the window in the center frame out of focus. Then there's movement in the window. The camera zooms past both Marlow and Wade to the scene past the window with both continuing their conversation and you see Wade's husband throw himself into the ocean in suicide. Great camera work, but the acting is played so deadpan by both that given the circumstances it just didn't seem believable. Gould's Marlow faces numerous situations where he plays it so deadpan it just didn't work for me, that's just one example.
And the ending, far from being a shocker, simply played out an obvious violent outcome that today wouldn't be the slightest bit outrageous. And yes, I recognize that the shocker is moral and not just a shock from violence. Maybe society today has simple degenerated over the last 30 years WRT accepting violent imagery. But it just didn't work for me either as a shocker or as a satisfactory conclusion to the story line. Honestly, Chinatown is a much better early '70s take on Noir and IMO eclipses this film by far.
Now I admit, I haven't read the Chandler book, nor have I seen The Big Sleep in a long, long time. So I don't have the context to properly review this film from a historical perspective. My review is strictly based on a single viewing last night where I walked away from the film disappointed after having expected to much more based on the reviews here. By all means, if you're exploring Altman films do rent this picture. Watch it. Then based on that decide if it's appropriate for your collection. If so, buy it with pleasure.

What's amazing is how well this self-conscious jokiness fits with the bleak motivations of the flick's traditionally noir characters.
Gould's Everyman-ish anti-Marlowe is one you'd actually like to hang out with. He's just as good with cats as with comebacks, for instance.

When American cinema sets out to adapt a novel for the screen what they normally do is smooth off the sharp edges, make it less dark, sanitize it, make the characters better looking, more squeaky clean, make the ending happier, etc. What Altman does to Chandler is pretty well the very opposite of this, presenting a far bleaker and more pessimistic of Philip Marlow and his world than Chandler does. It's also unusually demanding and literate in that it doesn't simply adapt the book and set out to tell a similar story. It also comments on the book and the central things it says will only succeed in communicating themselves to those who know the book. That fact may go a long way to explaining why the film is rather less well known than it deserves to be.

Meanwhile he gets a call from Nina van Pallandt's Ellen Wade who wants him to find her stray husband Roger (Sterling Hayden) and it seems they knew the Lennoxes. Meanwhile too, the psychopathic hoodlum Marty Augustine (Mark Rydell) is squeezing Marlow for the money Lennox owed him... Then the plot thickens. Enough said.
The use of music is rather distinctive and contributes quite a lot to the film's unique feel. There's a slow, jazzy theme song and, much if not all the time, it's the only music we hear. It's not just used as incidental music but dominates the sound environment of the action. When Marlow goes to a bar, it is being played on the piano. When Augustine's girlfriend is waiting for him in his car, she puts the radio on and there it is. And - I liked this touch - when Marlow is in Mexico trying to track Lennox down, we hear it played by the band of a passing funeral...
The acting is excellent. It's the definitive Elliot Gould movie certainly. Sterling Hayden is gloriously on form as huge drunk Roger Wade and Henry Gibson does a brilliantly job in the minor role of a sinister shady doctor exploiting Wade's alcoholism. It is of course beautifully directed and, characteristically for Altman, both very dark and very witty. The mixture of moods is brilliantly handled, from the opening scene, a classic example of Altmanesque comic aimlessness where Marlow goes shopping for the only brand of cat food acceptable to his very fussy pet, stopping to pick up brownie mix for the stoned out hippies next door; to, half an hour later, what, to give nothing away, one might call the Coke Bottle Scene, one of the most explosive and disturbing moments of violence in any movie; to the painfully uncomfortable scene where Wade is confronted by Gibson's nasty Dr Verringer at a beach party; to the devastatingly dark and ironic ending. Enormously worthwhile and utterly unlike any other Chandler adaptation you will ever see, the film is one of Altman's best which is saying a lot.  Watch it but, for maximal benefit, it's a particularly good idea to have read the book first.",1071187200,6,3198,4.600700525394045
429819,5,6302121582,"There are so many good ideas and concepts at work in this film. Here are a few:
1: In the DVD Special Features, Director Robert Altman talks about his overall concept for this film. His problem was how does a filmaker take a character that is so much from a different era and place him in modern times? Altman came up with a conceptual framework: look at the film as though Philip Marlowe, Chandler's ace detective from the 1940's, has been sleeping for thirty years and wakes up in the 1970's. Altman called it his ""Rip Van Marlowe"" concept. He thought of the film this way because he wanted to place the classic 1940 Marlowe sense of integrity and ethical code in the free-wheeling Seventies. This idea is ingenious and fits Eliott Gould's hip but outsider acting style to a tee.
2: Altman keeps the camera moving at all times. The lens does not jerk around in a mise en scene way, but more with long, smooth tracking and pan shots. This gives the movie a great feeling of constant action and forward movement, even when folks are just talking. The camera movement is done in such a smooth way, it seems very natural - as if you, the viewer, were really watching the action and simply turning your head to follow the flow of life.
3: The movie theme song is beautiful and was written by Johnny Mercer. It has a classic feel, and it dominates the sound of the film. Altman has put this haunting melody everywhere; in the sound of a doorbell, in the tune played in a Mexican funeral, in songs that come over half-heard radios - everywhere. It is the song the small time lounge piano player is trying to learn in the background of one scene, and it is the song that you will find yourself humming once the film is over. All this is almost done on a subliminal level, and it is brilliant.
4: The casting is tremendous and original. Elliott Guild is perfect as the man that seems out of place and almost lackadaisical on the surface, yet has a steel hard code of ethics that he lives by even - especially when -  no one else does.  Jim Bouton, the ex baseball star and writer of Foul Ball, is cast as Marlowe's friend, and he is a treat to watch -  all smarmy smile and charm. Another Altman favorite, Henry Gibson of Laugh-In fame is around as the reptilian Dr. Verringer and Sterling Hayden booms through his tragic turn as the Hemingway-like writer Roger Wade. Everyone is very good. Watch for two cool cameos: David Carradine as a hip-talking anti-establishment inmate that Marlowe meets in a short stay in prison, and Arnold Schwarzenegger (that's right, governor Schwarzenneger) as a  wordless muscle bound enforcer.
I really love this movie. As a director, Robert Altman gives actors more room than any other director in film history.  He lets them, as he says in the DVD special features, ""do what they became actors to do: be creative.""  This has its pluses and minuses, but it could, in some films, really make magic. There is a ""lifelike"" quality to the best of Altman's work, which is to say some of the best moviemaking ever done. I am thinking about Nashville and McCabe and Mrs. Miller, both films that linger and gain power in memory.
I will not give the end away, but it is worth waiting for and a real surprise. It is the moment in the film when the fairy-dust and dope smoke of the 70's is stripped away to reveal Gould/Marlowe's adamantine core; a center constructed around a very tight code of loyalty and integrity.
Do yourself a favor and buy it.",1070323200,107,3466,4.493650793650794
429820,5,6302121582,"The thing that strikes you when you when you first sit down with this film is, ""Elliot Gould as PHILLIP MARLOW??  Didn't Bogey nail that role so well that he owns it?""
Well, he does and he doesn't.  Gould is a brilliant casting-against-type, and Altman admits in the supplemental materials that it was this casting that finally drew him to the film.
Gould's Marlow is subtle, understated, and very casual.  He spends most of the movie giving the impression that nothing gets to him, that he is above all the lunacy that goes on around him.  Yet, in the end we see that his moral foundation runs very deep, and his sense of justice is stronger than his malaise.
Altman's direction is the true star of this film.  As is said in other reviews, this film only works in widescreen.  It's a stylistic triumph, and the camera work is particularly evocative.  Viewing this film today, we might see these unsteady, roaming images as passe, but in 1973 this technique was groundbreaking.  [It disturbed the critics so much that they didn't ""get it"" (of course, they didn't ""get"" 2001 either...).]  Yet, Altman's treatment - so new in 1974 - is actually far more mature than most of what passes for modern cinematography today.
It will take you about 15 minutes to make peace with Gould's Marlow, but only one minute to realize you are in the presence of something very special.  This is one of those buried jems waiting for your discovery.
Relish it.",1066694400,3,1440,4.6561264822134385
429821,5,6302121582,"Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name and the studio had no idea how to market the offbeat movie. It polarized critics and promptly disappeared from theatres. However, the film has survived on video and television, but only in a compromised pan and scan version that butchered Vilmos Zsigmond's superb 2.35:1 widescreen camerawork. Finally, The Long Goodbye receives a proper DVD treatment that it so richly deserves.
The Long Goodbye is much more than a murder mystery. Taking Chandler's novel set in the 1940s and updating it to the 1970s, Altman is also interested in satirizing the superficiality of Los Angeles culture. Marlowe is surrounded by an odd cast of denizens that populate the city: his neighbours are a group of women who spend their time getting high and doing yoga, the security guard for the Wade's estate does impersonations of famous actors like Barbara Stanwyk and Jimmy Stewart, and a nasty gangster who is proud of his Jewish heritage.
The stand-out amongst the extras on this DVD is the ""Rip Van Marlowe"" featurette. It runs about 24-minute and is an excellent retrospective look at the movie. Robert Altman and Elliot Gould are interviewed and talk about how they got involved with the project. Both men provide all sorts of fascinating information and are refreshingly candid.
The Long Goodbye is one of the best examples of American cinema in the '70s and now it is finally available on DVD in its original aspect ratio. MGM has produced a top-notch transfer and a solid collection of supplemental material that should appeal to fans of the movie and newcomers who are looking for something a little different.",1056067200,4,1642,4.974545454545455
429872,4,6302121582,"I was so surprise by this little known Robert Altmas film because I had read such varied things about it.  I wouldn't have even bothered had I not read the Raymond Chandler book of the same name a few years ago.  It was my favorite Philip Marlowe novel and the longest.  The movie itself has traditions in the old noir and the contemporary 1970s.  The novel itself was already 20 years old when they shot the film, and the screenwriter Leigh Brackett co-wrote the BIG SLEEP starring Humphrey Bogart as Marlowe.  Here Marlowe is out of his time.  He even drives a vintage 1940s car in 1970s Los Angeles.
While other Marlowe films are pretty consistent with the novels, The Long Goodbye changes a number of things around.  There characters are pretty much the same with some additions.  There is still the same business with the $5,000 bill, but it is handled in a completely different way.
Elliot Gould is a strange but inspired choice for a 1970s Marlowe.  He has no office in the world of Altman/Brackett, and he takes his messages and phone calls from a local bar.  As in all these stories, there are two mysteries that really wrap into one big mystery.  Jim Bouton, the ex-baseball player famous for his book Ball Four, plays Gould's Pal, Terry Lennox, the character the whole movie revolves around.
The DVD has two excellent documentaries.  The first is a look back at the Long Goodbye with interviews from Altman and Gould.  The second is a look at the cinematography of the Long Goodbye with conematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond.  There is also a magazine article reprinted on the DVD about the look of the film, the theatrical trailer and some radio spots.
If anyone is a fan of Altman Gould or even Raymond Chandler, this is a much under rated film.  I find Altman's output has varied from great to atrocious, but this is one of his best.",1049932800,2,1842,4.607361963190184
429873,5,6302121582,This is a great noir and one of my favorite Altman films. What I really love about Altman is how amazingly accuratly he caputures the essence of each of the times and places that he creates in. It's a twisted fun flick and Gould was one hottie. Who knew?,1035417600,,254,4.204081632653061
429874,5,6302121582,"What director, Robert Altman did with ""The Long Goodbye"" is what he does best. He takes either a subject or genre and turns it inside out, until it becomes something completely different. He has done this to everything from the myths of the old West (""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"") to most recently, the old standbye of the English drawing room murder(""Gosford Park"").In ""The Long Goodbye"" Altman works his movie magic on Raymond Chandler's private eye, Phillipe Marlowe. In this film Altman plops the iconic 40's & 50's detective (masterfully played by Elliot Gould) right into the middle of 1970s, Southern California. The plot is the usual labyrinth, that you would expect a Chandler character to be in. Marlowe's good friend, Terry Lennox mysteriously drops by and asks the detective for a ride to Mexico. Days later he winds up dead from an apparent suicide. Meanwhile, Marlowe is hired by the wife of an alcholic writer, in a missing persons case. Is there some how a connection between all these events?Along the way the movie viewer gets the fun of following Marlowe, as he meets tough guy cops, psychotic gangsters,a quack doctor, even a cult of naked yoga enthusiasts. Gould reinvents the character and plays him as a figure who is an anachronism, a man lost in time. He wanders the landscape in a haze, mumbling smart remarks and nonsequiturs. He is a man who is preplexed by the antics and lifestyles of the modern world. Everytime he is confronted by 1970s California weirdness, he responds with the mantra ""its O.K. by me"".Not only is his cheap suit and car decades old, but so are his values and that famous moral code that he lives by. But in the twisted surprise ending of the film, it is those values and moral codes that he sticks by. This is a really great film, that humourously turns the Marlowe legend upside down. Gould really shows us his acting chops and gives a great performance. He is backed up with a wonderful supporting cast(Henry Gibson, Nina Van Pallandt, Mark Rydell, Jim Bouton) that gives us some amazingly crazy characters. Especially good is veteren actor, Sterling Hayden as the drunken, Hemingway-like author. Hayden gives a very vigorous and moving portrayle of a man at the end of his emotional rope. Finally a mention should be made of the movie's theme song. The Mercer/Williams tune is played throughout the film in many weird and different ways, that are too many to list. Keep an ear out for them. This is a simply great movie that will fascinate and entertain. What would Humphery Bogart think, if he saw all of this? I think Bogie would have had a good laugh...",1031961600,33,2604,4.750551876379691
429875,4,6302121582,"As a confirmed Raymond Chandler addict, I highly recommend this film if you're interested in more than trite, superficial fiction or literal interpretations. Now a purist might not be so fond of this film, but if you want to see what sort of ... results from a literal interpretation of a Marlowe novel brought into present day, then go watch the Bob Mitchum starring version of The Big Sleep. Conversely, if you want to see a good interpretation, then go watch the Mitchum starring Farewell, My Lovely, which wasn't stupid enough to bring the character into present day but left the more or less ""literal"" incarnation of this famous detective in the past (30's/40's) where he belongs. Altman's version of The Long Goodbye shows what sort of impossibility it is to imagine a real Philip Marlowe in (then) present day by updating the character into a fairly aimless, lost soul with not much to do and no place to belong (just as Chandler's moral though not quite shining knight would be if he were transported to more modern times). Now, The Long Goodbye itself is dated, almost as far back in the past relative to today as Chandler's world was to the day of Goodbye's making. Much can be learned here about what form values take in the modern environment, becoming confused, selfish to a degree, and darn near psychopathic (witness the final scene of this film to find out what sort of nihilistic twist the story takes compared to the original book). Much of the original novel is here, however, mainly the weary, sentimental, sad tone and the theme of friendship among men, one not so ""bad,"" the other not so ""good"". Eliot Gould puts out one of the great acting jobs of the 1970's in this film, in my honest opinion. And far from being populated by ""weirdos,"" this version of Chandler's classic novel is populated by characters that, more or less, are accurate portrayls of the kind of people who inhabited the beach communities of southern CA in the 1970's. In fact, not only do these people STILL exist in this area, but they existed in Chandler's day, as anyone who has actually read his novels will attest If you want a fun double feature, watch this film with The Big Lebowski, an even more ""modern"" take on the Marlowe mystique, though without Marlowe himself. If you want an educational triple header, throw in the Bogart/Bacall/Hawks version of The Big Sleep (the ultimate of all ultimate Marlowe films). If you really wanna have fun and have the free time & stamina, throw in the (1974?) version of Farewell, My Lovely, in my opinion an underrated 70's gem. If you want something to REALLY pass on, ignore the ... Mel Gibson film Payback, which is only a ... of the Lee Marvin Classic, Point Blank.",1031011200,,2708,4.679245283018868
429876,4,6302121582,"Robert Altman takes the detective genre and turns it inside out with a real cynical 70's take and a lot of good humor. Instead of the crisp, crackling Maltese Falcon, Big Sleep, Lady in the Lake dialogue & snappy pace, we get a laid-back, slouching, rumpled Elliot Gould as Marlowe, a private detective in the modern world, with no glamor and no cachet. No dames are falling over this guy. He isn't pals with the cops. He isn't a dark knight patrolling the mean city streets. He's a informal slob doing schlock work in a world that doesn't give a damn.

Or is he? Marlowe is smarter than anyone gives him credit, and in the end, he does seem to give a damn about an ultimate justice.

Along the way he meets a maniacal, funny, and frightening Mark Rydell as Marty Augustine, the gangster. Jim Boughton, an erstwhile friend and typical Malibu hanger-on hustler. An indelible Sterling Hayden as an alcoholic writer very close to the man he really was at the end (an alcoholic novelist). Nina Van Pallandt the femme fatale. And assorted characters & creeps, topless neighbors & sinister shrinks all done in the controlled improvisational style of the best of Altman. Take note too, that the camera is constantly in motion in nearly every shot.

There is some nice dialogue, an unforgettale scene when Rydell gives his mistress a Coke (!), and a sweetly sardonic updated ending that fits the modern world better than Chandler's did. I really give it 4-1/2, knocking off the 1/2 star because the repeating of the song everywhere throughout the movie was just too cute. Really worth seeing.",1017619200,4,1584,4.731884057971015
429877,4,6302121582,"Very strange, very early 70's, very unusual blend of the sensually oversaturated and morally burned out wealthy bohemes of southern California and the anachronistic wise-cracking of (Elliot Gould's) Marlowe. The jaded icon Marlowe stood out in the 40's for his extra hard and impenetrable shell which of course defended an incorruptible center but next to the hedonistic elite who occupy the lazy pleasure palaces of Malibu  he just seems hopelessly out of place and hopelessly ineffective. His wisecracks are often mumbled under his breath and to himself because the Californians he is surrounded by do not get irony. Altman's use of the Marlowe character has annoyed some Chandler purists because Altman's Marlowe acts like a seventies drop out despite the cheap suit and tie and all the clever come ons and put downs. That part of his character that is incorruptible only shows up late when he gets drunk with Nina and shows he actually cares what has happened. The weird thing is that so much of it is played for laughs and so sincerity looks out of place in the movie.  It is unclear just what Altman wants to get across, is he just being super hip and taking glib shots at square material or is he using the detective with a moral center to make a moral judgement on all those criminally characterless Californians.  The hedonism and moral paucity looks good on the outside(Nina Van Pallandt!, Marlowe's lesbian neighbors doing topless yoga on their front porch,  beat hippie intellectual gatherings on the beach)but on the inside these people have hearts of darkness. There is a murder and of course Marlowe gets called in to sort out the mess and of course it becomes more complicated than that. I'll leave the plot alone because it is a mystery and it shouldn't be spoiled, but nothing is what you think it is and no one is who or what they first appear to be and some aspects of this mystery remain unsolved(the strange fantasy island clinic/ cult and its Dr./guru remains an unpenetrated, though very sunny, darkness). An incredible beach side bungalow(Altmans own house) is the center of most of the action which involves Van Pallandt and her husband, a drunken and brilliant but spent writer, played by a grey bearded Sterling Hayden who does a real turn with the role(sort of part John Huston, part Nick Nolte). These two characters are infinitely watchable and their undefined situation very intriguing. Next to them Marlowe simply seems a very declasse and bumbling loafer and he never really gets the upper hand as the classic Marlowe would have. The truth remains hidden from him and what portion of the truth he does uncover is just that portion which affects him personally.
  Altman is the master at allowing a film to aquire its own organic shape and flow and letting actors invent and while this film does that it also has to keep coming back to the Chandler material which creates a kind of compromised predicament where perhaps everything is compromised.
 Altman films either hit big or miss big though a few of them do a bit of both and this is one of those.  The already uneasy relationship  between Altman and the Chandler novel really reaches a  breaking point by the end of the picture. The ending is the ultimate subversion of the Marlowe myth. Altman wants you to be shocked and you are.  However you feel about the films strange blending of dark and light material there is some kind of strange seductive magic in certain moments like those great shots of Marlowe and the ocean reflected on the glass door and that beautiful Nina with her long blonde mane and blue eyes and European accent and long white Moroccan dresses who will seduce anyone who watches this film. I think Altman likes California and Californians more than he likes Noir.",1015718400,3,3774,4.7907692307692304
429878,4,6302121582,"I'm a bit conflicted when it comes to Robert Altman's adaptation of Raymond Chandler's ""The Long Goodbye.""  While their individual sensibilities are totally at odds with one another, I think both men are unique, flawed geniuses.
Maybe that's why, while I understand why detective novel purists often claim Altman violated the basic elements of Chandler's work, I think this is an immensely enjoyable film, even though it kicks and strains and pulls away from its source material as casually as it can.
Elliott Gould plays Phillip Marlowe as a mumbling, slightly spaced-out chain-smoker and the camera tends to glide along after him like a slow-poke friend. This, of course, works against the shrewd economy of Chandler's original narrative. And just in case the languid pace makes you forget you're watching a movie, Altman's constant in-jokes and a running gag involving the title song lean into the frame every so often to refresh your memory.
This isn't a perfect film and it's not for everybody -- it's nowhere near as focused and energetic as the Gould/Altman collaberation, ""California Split,"" that arrived two years later.  And toward the end of the movie, the film seems to lose its bearings around the time Marlowe finds his buried anxiety and actually begins whining.
The final scene (which I won't go into for those who haven't seen ""The Long Goodbye"") feels like a Peckinpah grab and not just becase the editor, Lou Lombardo, cut  ""The Wild Bunch,""
either, though the slow motion bullet impact and flying body don't help.
But there's so many good parts here it's easy to forgive the whole -- the crazy opening sequence with the cat food and the grocery store; the trick Marlowe plays on Harry the Hood; Henry Gibson's creepy Dr. V.; Sterling Hayden's frustrating but amazing hell or high water performance; Marty Augustine's little monologues about love, fear and forgiveness.
I read yesterday that ""The Long Goodbye"" will be out on DVD soon and that's great news because this is a quintessential widescreen movie, and my letterboxed copy, taped off TCM and edited for broadcast (which means my version barely glances at the nudists next door), is so worn out, it's about to meet a long goodbye of its own.",1012003200,4,2218,4.956989247311828

Good advice in my book.

A good introduction to film noir is .<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Side-of-the-Screen-Film-Noir/dp/0306817721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Side of the Screen: Film Noir</a>&nbsp;by Foster Hirsch. Without this background, the dark images permeating this film are inexplicable, and the complexity of the plot baffles both Gould, and even an experienced noir lover like myself.

Altman has also described what he was trying to accomplish with the movie. ""United Artists were promoting it as a hard boiled detective movie,"" he said. ""It was anything but. I tried to take Raymond Chandler and do what he did. He paid no attention to his plots. He used his action as an excuse to hang about a hundred thumbnail sketches on. That's what I tried to do. My obligation wasn't to the plot of his book, but to the spirit of his book.""

Well, I'm on the fence -- is this good film noir? Is it film noir at all? And, does it capture the ""spirit"" of Chandler?

I'm not sure, even after watching it a second and a third time.
