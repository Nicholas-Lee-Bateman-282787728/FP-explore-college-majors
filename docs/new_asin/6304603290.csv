7874787,5,6304603290,"Thrilling Christmas favorites by Luciano Pavarotti, 'Christmas with Pavarotti' is almost a perfect videotape. The setting--Montreal's Notre Dame Cathedral--is terrific and the selection of songs is outstanding. Pavarotti is backed by a full orchestra and adult choir, as well as a boys' choir for some of the songs. This tape was made in the early-1980s. It was recorded as ambient sound (Pavarotti did not sing into a microphone for this performance) The high notes, which reverberate off the Cathedral's high ceiling, but do not record all that well. In any event, just to have this performance on tape is a rare treat.  This tape is a great Christmas treat for all Classical music and Luciano Pavarotti enthusiasts.
