4161642,1,B003O68AA4,"OMG....... I've seen just about every GLBT movie ever made, and unfortunately this one was about the worst I've ever seen.  I'm not quite sure what the actual plot was about.  Seriously.....I have no idea what I just watched.  The acting was SO incredibly bad that I felt sorry for the actors.  I've seen better acting from elementary school students.  Yes, there was like one full frontal nude scene with one of the actors sticking is balls into a drink while someone else blew bubbles on his balls through a straw, and they called it a ""ballcuzzi"".  Even that was not worth the $1.99 rental.  This movie was just plain boring and absurd.  I could go on and on, but I won't waste another second of my life on this film.  Do not, under any circumstances, waste any of your time or money on this movie.  Even if someone offers to show it to you for FREE, or if they offer to pay you to sit and watch it, you should run, don't walk, in the other direction.  It was that bad.  I want my $1.99 back!!!!!!!!",1287792000,19,1002,4.2994652406417115
4161643,1,B003O68AA4,i think this is the worst thing i have ever watched! what a total waste of money! don't waste your time or money on this you cant even call it a movie. ugh!,1381363200,,156,3.757575757575758
4161644,4,B003O68AA4,"I watched this movie more than once; Gay film has more to say than simply sex.  The film gives some insight into the aging homosexual, and the fears that come with age. The younger men are not teens or twenty-somethings, so they have fears of their own, but are compassionate for their older friend. Each one is seeking a relationship and it is interesting to watch this unfold.  All of the young men are beautiful, especially Gregori Holderbach with his delightful accent. This is worth seeing especially if you are interested in understanding how people think (and like beautiful men).",1381276800,,587,4.86
4161645,1,B003O68AA4,"I would prefer to give it a 0 but that is not an option. I wish I had read the other reviews before wasting my time and money on what is probably the worst written, directed, and acted film I can recall. How it ever got released and chosen for Amazon will remain a mystery. It totally lacks in any humanity.",1381190400,,307,4.049180327868853
4161646,2,B003O68AA4,This movie was okay. It felt cheap and while the writing was witty the acting was AWFUL. The majority of the actors were good eye candy which kept me entertained but I would never recommend it to anyone.,1381190400,,203,4.368421052631579
4161647,1,B003O68AA4,"To be clear up front, I did not watch more than the first 15 minutes of this movie, but even that was a challenge. The script is trite, way too ""bitchy"" and very poorly ""acted,"" if that word even approaches the dialog delivery that I witnessed. I only paid $1.99 for this rental on Amazon, but feel that I took the shaft. If this were bought in the produce department, I would definitely return it for a refund. There are a growing number of good Gay movies available these days. Retire this one to the vault!",1378339200,,509,4.3125
4161648,1,B003O68AA4,Lasted about twenty minutes into this floater....plus the transmission was putrid. Chop stop chock restart.....time out again....yarg...the actors were annoying bu the writting was just plain dense and made no sense...why did they have a dialog when the door bell rings over and over...and more useless babble...argh.,1359849600,,317,5.76595744680851
4161649,1,B003O68AA4,"Waste of time completely.  Only one frontal.  Shaky camera during most of the scenes.  Too dark in so many places.  Dumb writing.  Stupid directing.  Only at max 2 cute guys, at MAX.  Do not even waste your time.  Google the one hot guy to find the nude pic.  Not worth it.  We're talking like one flash of frontal, like that's it.  Not even worth spending 5 cents on.",1358553600,,368,4.264705882352941
4161650,1,B003O68AA4,Sorry its been so long since I watched it that I guess it didn't leave me with a lasting impression!!!,1349481600,,102,4.15
4161651,2,B003O68AA4,"Poor acting.  If I would want to see it again, no once was enough....  Would not recommend this movie.  Only one good looking guy, very disapointing.",1342051200,,149,4.653846153846154
4161652,1,B003O68AA4,This was a terrible movie. I am the 12th person rating... 12 X $2= $24. That means they covered their budget. Just because they got an actor that kind of looks like Gale Harold does not make it QAF. And the old queen went to the Edith Massey (god rest her soul) acting school. There were about three funny lines. Save your $2,1338249600,,325,4.174603174603175
4161653,1,B003O68AA4,"...how utterly terrible this movie was.  It did not have a single redeeming quality.  I can deal with low budget, but this movie has faults that can't be blamed on the budget.  The acting was terrible-- a couple of the actors in particular were just awful.  And the story was totally incoherent.  Really-- if your only choices are to watch this movie or clean the bathroom, clean the bathroom",1337990400,,392,4.6231884057971016
4161654,1,B003O68AA4,"I regret renting this movie. The camera work and lighting were terrible. It was bad enough to distract me from what plot there was. The acting was wooden on the part of pretty much everyone but Joshua Garcia.

  The story itself left a bad taste in my mouth. Either the writers never had siblings, or it they did they must have hated them. The ""love"" story of the movie didn't make any sense. Aren't we over wish-fulfillment straight to gay story-lines yet?

  Anyway, not worth your 1.99 to rent, try Redwoods or Strapped if you want to see something by people who actually know how to make a movie.",1329091200,4,600,4.458715596330276
4161655,1,B003O68AA4,"I'm sure these actors worked for free just to get in a movie. The acting is worse than a 10 year old's. I cannot believe the price they ask for a copy, but perhaps they are saving up for agony claims. Especially the old guy's acting is so bad, you will be wondering if he does it on purpose. Skip this crap please.",1327708800,4,314,4.0
4161656,1,B003O68AA4,"I hope the people working on this video had some fun doing it.  Just because someone bought you a video camera for your birthday doesn't mean that you can make watchable entertainment.  20 pages of dialogue and a hodge-podge of friends willing to help seem to be all that this ""film"" needed to get distributed.  This would be fine to have made for fun and to show to your friends while you get buzzed, but this film isn't ready for public viewing.  The production values are terrible.  I literally cheered at the moment that the shaky camera was finally put on a tripod.  It was the only moment I felt like cheering.  The characters are pretty universally unlikable.  The ""story"" is as thin as gauze.  The lighting was dreadful, acting was mostly uninspired, and the camera work was nauseating.  Sound did a reasonable job, although it was too bad that what they recorded wasn't worth the tape.
I'm done with this.  It's already stolen too much of my time.  Don't let it waste yours.  Find some other good independent gay movie to watch.  There are tons of them and lots of talent behind them.",1315180800,16,1093,4.56701030927835
4161657,1,B003O68AA4,OMG! I have learned a valuable lesson about checking the reviews BEFORE I rent!  I can not say it any better than these others!  This movie - and I use that term loosely - was the most disappointing thing I have ever rented.  Granted I don't know much about these actors but I have a difficult time calling them that!  I at no time detected a plot and certainly what little sex there was had no redeeming value to it! I feel ripped of and will not waste another dime or minute with this one!,1313884800,8,491,4.136842105263158
4161658,1,B003O68AA4,"I can't believe I paid $1.99 to rent this movie. There really isn't any story line. Why is Tommy Hamilton still acting? I just wanted to shake him out of his bad acting mode to see what he really is like, away from the camera. I felt like I was watching a middle school performance. Shame on the director for not working with these actors to develop something more than just delivering lines, and badly I may add. I'm not sure the experience these actors have had. It seems a couple years, tops, but the younger actors all have a chance. Most of them were real easy on the eyes with decent bodies. If it wasn't for some of the sex scenes, I most likely would have turned if off within the first 10 minutes. I did enjoy watching uncut Andrew Brian Smith, in his cocktail drink scene. Joshua Garcia has an incredible face to look at. All in all, it was a poor movie, with a lot of great looking actors. Looks will only get them so far. What do I know? I've been acting and directing for 25 years and never made it to the screen. Just one director's opionion. Take it as it is.",1312675200,7,1074,4.193236714975845
4161659,1,B003O68AA4,"I agree with others who rate it as the very very worst gay movie  ever. Shakey  camera  - extremely bad lighting.  In many scenes  the actors faces are too dark to enable us to see them ( this is in daylight  as well). Bad script,  bad editing at times and  no one has  any talent for acting especially tommy  hamilton who gives the queeniest performance ever  and  he is embarrassing to watch . He has  zero talent and knows nothing about the art of acting. Same for Julian le blanc who stays  still and recites  his dialogue without any feeling -like he is talking to a wall -simply terrible. The director  -well the less said about him the better. I failed to see any direction whatsoever. This  film  should be seen by film students on  how NOT to make a film. The  dvd sleeve shows 3 touched up photos of guys on the cover. They  don't look this pretty  in the film. Even the title means nothing. 'Do' what?. The film gives a new meaning to the  word ""GARBAGE"".",1305331200,14,966,4.273743016759776
4161660,5,B003O68AA4,"I truly enoyed this picture. I realize that it is not a Hollywood blockbuster that has millions of dollars thrown at it, but it was witty and funny and just plain adorable. If it were not for independent filmmakers like these we would not have as much of a selection to choose from. I watched it with my partner three times. I have seen much worse, and I commend the actors who did a great job.",1294185600,2,394,4.197368421052632
4161661,5,B003O68AA4,"I loved this film. A friend suggested I take a look and I'm glad I did.
YES, it's funny.
YES, it's charming.
And, YES, it's overall connotations are real and to the point.
If you consider yourself any type of 'movie buff', pay attention not-only-to-the-performances, but to the way this film was shot by the director, Stephen Shypitka; his use of shadow and light make some scene's environment and atmosphere a performance and 'character' in the film itself - which just exemplifies the great performances of the actors. It has a 'Fellini-esque' quality to it.
It's a really good film with a really good cast.
I'll be doing my own recommendations to other friends to SEE THIS FILM.

4161662,5,B003O68AA4,"I don't know what the other reviewers saw
But if you really watch the entire movie
It is charming, funny and witty.
It may not have a million dollar budget
But my partner and I found it compelling and fun.

Think of the Naked Civil Servant having guests.
If you really are a true gay film fan this film is for you.
If you just want glitz, a bar, an orgy, etc.
Rent or buy something else.
This movie is not for avid movie goers.
My partner and I really enjoyed it 3 times.

8401432,1,B003O68AA4,"I want to hammer roofing nails into my skull now.  I've never watched a worse movie in all aspects.  One thing no one else mentioned was the seagull sound effects during the dinner party.  What?  Why?  And the movie description says lots of hot guys, but there was only one, the tall Irish guy.  Everyone else made me nauseous.  Don't waste your $1.99 and go buy a Slim Jim instead.",1401753600,,382,4.371428571428571
8401433,1,B003O68AA4,"I could not get through more than a few minutes of this giant pile of crap before I wrote to Amazon demanding a refund. Admittedly, I have rented some bad movies in the past, but I took my lumps and just paid for them. Not this time. Where does this description say that the camera never stops shaking (cameraman had tremors?) Seriously, this film defines a whole new low in cinema. When will Amazon develop some MINIMUM standards and not accept crap like this?",1395964800,,461,4.5
