I was inspired to get this after getting the Great Moments at Husky Stadium DVD, which is good, but this is better!",1339459200,,251,3.7547169811320753
8066478,5,B0009TAQ0G,"Hosted by the late Don Poirier, this 1990 video looks at the history of Husky Football, from the days of the Sundodgers through the great(and turbulent) Jim Owens years and the Don James regime, ending with the 1989 season. Of course, 1990 set the foundation for the 1991 perfect season, and the ""official"" 100 Years Of Husky Football game was the Washington-USC game, won by the Dawgs 31-0. In the words of SC quarterback Todd Marinovich, ""All I saw was Purple"".
I'd love to see this re-released as a DVD, but at least I have a few copies of the VHS tape in reserve.",1278806400,,567,4.461538461538462
