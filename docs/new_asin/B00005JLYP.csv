the plot

The judge gave Stanley the choice between real jail time or spend the six months at Camp Green Lake.  You see, Stanley Yelnats IV is sent to Camp Green Lake when he was hastily sentenced for stealing a very expensive pair of sneakers, a crime that he did not commit but couldn't prove it.  He is thrown into a cabin complete with about eight other nicknamed ""campers"".  All of the campers' sentences are the same, go out into the desert and dig a very large hole, one so big that it would usually take the whole morning, and afternoon.

Stanley tells the campers his story that he has heard all his life from his grandfather and his father.  He tells them about how all of theYelnats are cursed to never prosper and have bad luck.  It all happened a long time ago when Stanley's great-great-grandfather, Elya, promised an old gypsy Madame Zeroni a favor in exchange for her advise on how to win the heart of Myra Menke, the object of his desire.  When he almost gets what he wants, he is disillusioned and disgusted by the utter stupidity of Myra Menke and moves to America from his home in Latvia.  He forgot to keep the promise and was therefore cursed by Madame Zeroni.

Stanley has a tough time in Camp, from the difficult labor of digging these very large holes, to having to deal with the threats and bullying from the other campers.  He does find a friend in Zero, a short little guy who seems eager to dig his daily hole.  Stanley later agrees to teach Zero how to read if he helps Stanley dig his hole.  One day, Zero runs away into the desert to try and escape despite the warnings from their watchman that escape out in this desert is futile, no one can survive in this Texas heat or those evil deadly yellow-spotted lizards.  A couple of days go by and Stanley worried about Zero, also escapes into the desert in order to find him so that he could bring him back.  But Stanley wasn't ready for what he finds out there.  Find out what he finds in the desert, and much more that may fill the many ""holes"" I left in this plot summation when you buy Disney's Holes.

the breakdown

In one of Shia LaBeouf's first cinematic roles in Holes, Stanley Yelnats is a very memorable character.  First off he's got an awesome name where his first name is his last name spelled backwards.  Shia is his usual self, meaning he is a bit hyper, suspicious and has a bit of that reserved know-it-all-ism.  Shia's Stanley is the same as Shia's Sam Witwicky (Transformers), and the same as Kale (Disturbia).  Yet as Shia's acting range may seem a bit limited, he's likeable to get away with it.

Also despite the three or four different stories that unfold bit by bit as the movie progresses, it's not a chore to follow along, it's a pleasure because each tale has a rewarding payoff as you approach them.  There's the story of how the Curse of Yelnats began, then there is one story of the early days of Camp Green Lake starring Miss Katherine, the continuing story of the ruthless and revengeful kissin' Kate Barlowand the Yelnats brush with the outlaw, as well as the story of The Warden's ancestors in Camp Green Lake, and why she has the boys digging holes as punishment.  What could she be looking for?

Disney's Holes is home to an all-star cast, including Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Galaxy Quest) as The Warden, Miss Walker.  She is as tough as nails especially to her staff, but is also eerily lenient to Stanley.  Then there's the dimwitted watchman Mr. Sir, played by Jon Voigt (Pride and Glory, Transformers).  Voigt supplied some good laughs with his character.  The very beautiful Patricia Arquette's (Fast Food Nation, Stigmata) looks fit her period piece character, school teacher Miss Katherine like a glove.  Henry Winkler (Click, The Water Boy), like Shia, is his usual self as Stanley Yelnats III, but also likeable enough to pull it off.  The late Eartha Kitt, in one of her last roles as Madame Zeroni was perfect.  Her small appearance and her big eyes make for the perfect magical gypsy, which in turn makes her threats of a curse that much more frightful and believable.

Despite the length of Holes, the star-studded cast and huge sets, Walt Disney Pictures budgeted this film with a relatively small $20 million.  Holes was not one of Disney's most famous pictures, but it made a respectable $67 million at the box office - giving Disney a mildly successful film.

As a Disney fan in general, there was a time that when a Disney DVD was released I would buy it.  Holes was one of them, and despite living in my collection for over five years, I've never watched it.  So, when we finally sat down to watch this so it wouldn't be a total impulse waste of money, we were very surprised with the shiny gem this turned out to be.  It has enough emotional connections to make you cry, laugh, get angry and sit on the edge of your seat.  At nearly two hours, this may be a bit trying for the very young ones, I suggest the 7-year-olds and over would enjoy the film immensely.

1470689,5,B00005JLYP,"HOLES is a fable more than it is anything else, to be relished by middle-schoolers and ages up. It's also an award-winning bestseller by Louis Sachar. If you're not a fan of Shia LaBeouf, then I'm sorry to say that he's in this film adaptation. He plays Stanley Yelnats, an unfortunate boy who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a peculiar place that is neither green nor has a lake but, instead, sits in the middle of the punishing Texas desert with no other source of water for one hundred miles out. Stanley's family has been forever long shackled by a family curse, one that perpetuates the Yelnats' run of horrible luck. One such ill-fated turn of events lands Stanley in Camp Green Lake as punishment, sentenced there for eighteen months.

See, Camp Green Lake is a correction center for the most incorrigible of juvenile delinquents. There, Stanley and his fellow inmates must every day dig a hole - five feet deep, five feet wide (the length of their shovels). Why? No one knows. Supposedly, it's to build character, but it's flimsy justification. The boys are rewarded only should they dig up an item worthy of the Warden's interest, rewarded by taking the rest of the day off, that is.

In adapting book to cinema, HOLES gets the top-shelf treatment. It benefits from a roster of A-list actors and a director with an acuity for arresting visuals. Cinematographer Stephen St. John stages his cameras so that the unforgiving desert seems to go on forever, dust and dirt and grit everywhere. Camp Green Lake seems so isolated, so removed and detached from the outside world.

It makes the villainy and quirkiness of the camp's supervisory staff that much more severe. Sigourney Weaver as the Warden and Jon Voight as the overseer, Mr. Sir, are stand-outs. They play peculiar characters, but Weaver and Voight smartly don't descend to caricature work. There are layers and undercurrents to how they interpret their roles and how they build up this edgy dynamic between them. Note that even though the ominous Mr. Sir seems, on the surface, to be the most frightening of the bunch, he's quite easily cowed by the Warden. On the surface, Weaver's Warden is this elegant, ladylike person, but there is venom to her.

The narrative doesn't restrict itself to Camp Green Lake or to present time. Huge chunks of HOLES are flashback sequences that detail generations-old events that trace back to a scorned fortune teller (Eartha Kitt) and a legendary bandit queen (Patricia Arquette). Watching the movie as it unfolds, I wondered how all these disparate plot lines would tie in. Gratifyingly, they end up converging sublimely, with all sorts of connections ultimately clicking in perfect. An ancient family curse. A legend about a missing thumb. A yellow-spotted lizard. Kissin' Kate Barlow's vanished loot. A dried up lake and the murdered onion maker. They all fit in.

So many film adaptations of YA lit are dumbed-down. That's not so with HOLES. This movie doesn't condescend. It's smartly written, marvelously acted. It balances myth-making and sweeping adventure. It touches on recognizable human foibles even as it inserts an assortment of colorful personalities. It presents big bads brimming with sinister comic menace and a strongly-developed friendship between our palindromic point-of-view character and a quiet, little misfit boy (Khleo Thomas) who can dig holes faster than fast. HOLES is a family movie, yes, but fraught with edginess and weirdness. Because it's a family movie, you expect a happy ending. But it's sure as heck a serpentine journey with plenty of diverse moving parts. What fun.",1501977600,,3603,4.988352745424293

It's always the thought that counts at Christmas time, but I sure wish my cousin had spent his money on a gift card instead.

My 9 year old and I watch this movie over and over again and never get sick of it; lots of laughs and quotable quotes. In addition, Disney did a pretty good job of staying true to the novel as well. I highly recommend this film just for fun and also as a good way to introduce to your kids the topic of our country's history and current issues surrounding race.",1485820800,,599,4.607476635514018

It had some boring parts, but they don't distract the viewer from the movie at all. They were very short and interesting parts quickly replaced boring parts.
CHARACTERS at CAMP GREEN LAKE
Mr. Sir: Mr. Sir is the assistant leader of Camp Green Lake, a juvenile delinquent center in Texas. He is known to be bold and tough.
Mr. Pendanski: Mr Pendanski is a counselor at Camp Green Lake. He tries to be friendly, but really he is just as impudent as Mr. Sir
The Warden: Louise Walker is an insolent person who is the ""president"" of camp green lake. She is known to be mean and push others verbally to get what she wants. Her famous line is ""Excuse Me"".
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
STORYLINE:
Stanley Yelnats IV is accused of stealing a pair of shoes donated to a homeless shelter by the world-famous baseball player Clyde Livingston. He then has a hearing in court, and has the choice of either camp green lake or jail. He picked camp, and a bus takes him there. His admission is done by Mr. Sir, and he explains everything about the camp to Stanley. He (and the other inmates) must dig a hole each day at least 5' deep and 5' in diameter to ""build character"", but Stanley soon realizes that they aren't digging holes to build character, they are digging to find the Warden's paternal grandfather's money, which outlaw Kate Barlow stole from her grandfather and buried in the desert. In the end, Stanley becomes friends with inmate Hector Zeroni (commonly known as Zero) who is thought to be a stupid worthless child by Mr Pendanski and by the other inmates. He then teaches him how to read and they run away from camp and find refuge on a mountain. They are then released when they return to camp.

The story had a great lesson and I did enjoy the movie for that. The premise of the movie is this camp for young boys as an alternative to a detention center and the warden has them dig holes as their discipline. She has ulterior motives for them digging the holes, which is revealed about half way through.  There were 2 subplots occurring throughout the movie, which at times, was hard to follow but did draw together in the end.",1461542400,,587,4.376146788990826

The characters, especially the kids, aren't as fleshed out as in the book. That doesn't really make much of a difference. The personalities of the kids don't really add much to the story with the exception of Stanley and Zero.

The movie is very faithful to the book and leaves out very little and what is in the movie is very close to what's in the book. So if you are a fan of the book you should enjoy this movie.

Only negative for me is the usual liberal slant in a mainstream Hollywood production.

Recommended for just about anybody who enjoys movies that are a bit different than the norm.",1459987200,,718,4.257352941176471

My biggest complaint is when Signourey Weaver's character calls the boys jacka****. To me this is not necessary, doesn't happen in the book, and for a PG movie should be left out. Also there is a crude joke about needing a microscope to see the body part of a male, and I doubt most of my students did not even get this joke, but truly unnecessary.",1435622400,,611,4.177966101694915

1472561,4,B00005JLYP,"This movie was a relatively faithful adaption of ""Holes"", but its compressed pacing and safe Disney polish take out the cutting insight of the original book.

I miss the book's theme of humiliation, which haunted big fat Stanley and finally caused Zero to snap. I miss the tense life-or-death desperation of their escape, and the grit that scrapes Stanley's hands as he digs for water at the top of God's Thumb. I miss when X-Ray looks upon Zero digging for Stanley and says, ""It just isn't right for a white boy to make a black boy do his work."" It was those little intense things that made everything else matter. It makes otherwise-benevolent Mr. Pendanski's belittlement of Zero matter. It makes Stanley and Zero not heading back to camp matter. It makes Stanley's redemption of his family line a trial that matters. It makes Sam being executed for being a black man kissing a white woman matter.

The book was a masterpiece. The movie is less than that. But the story always did have a pretty entertaining plot so the movie is still pretty fun.",1434758400,,1049,4.664864864864865

1472567,2,B00005JLYP,"Not good. I watched it for free and was trying very hard to enjoy it, but it tried  too hard to be quirky. It lacked character development and pacing. I haven't read the book, so I can't comment as to how the source material and movie intersect. I watched it right up to the scene  in the western town. This is where some movies fall flat on their faces. The black character selling snake oil would never have happened in the old west. People in those towns were some of the worst racist around.  For one thing blacks would probably not even be allowed in most towns of the period. Yes there were black cowboys, but they were not allowed to even go near or even talk to a white woman. The unlikely scenario of a young man getting 18 months for allegedly  stealing shoes is silly.  It looked like it was his first offense.  This movie just fails on so many levels. No I didn't  watch the whole movie, and I can see that most people liked it. I don't mind a multicultural  cast as long as  it stays true to the time period.",1434067200,,1021,4.194871794871795

I thought it was a terrific story, with many little pieces which miraculously came together in the end in a series of amazing coincidences. It was a similar kind of story telling that happened on Seinfeld, but this is not a comedy.

There is a very somber, but brief, look at racism in the Old West. Definitely a talking point for children, though perhaps not for those younger than 10 or 11.

1473400,5,B00005JLYP,"I have not read the book but I imagine that this movie sticks pretty close.

The story line is pretty straight-forward. Troubled kids are sent to a reform camp where they end up digging holes in the desert all day ostensibly to build character. The main character, Stanley Yelnats, is convinced that his bad fortune is due to a family curse.

Through a series of flashbacks we learn what was involved in the curse. Turns out the kid ends up unwittingly breaking the curse and bringing good fortune on his own family as well as another young inmate and his mother.

This is a funny film but a bit too sophisticated and complicated for young children.  This is exceptionally well-executed and entertaining.",1412899200,,704,4.745901639344262

This is a very well made movie. There is some light foul language (""Damned,"" ""hell,"" ""schmuck,"" and ""jackasses"" are all uttered), but nothing to be too concerned about. It is a Disney movie afterall! There is also some mild violence in the wild west flashbacks (a gun-toting female renegade kills men and then kisses their cheeks.

Since my students had completed the reading of teh book, a week prior, they knew every scene and what was going to happen in it.

Currently, my class is reading, Bud, Not Buddy; unfortunately, I could find no DVD/movie for that one. I wish I could.

Thank you, as always, for your promptness in delivery!

I guess this means I should change my user name, since I am not ""disgusted"" anymore. I chose that name when Amazon sent me Petting Farm, with no DVD.

Thanks!

We were eager to see the movie, but a bit anxious because we've been severely disappointed with so many book-to-movie films that we've seen (so often they change the story or leave out huge chunks).  That was not the case with Holes! They made a few changes and left out a few things, but stayed true to a lot of the book.

1475281,4,B00005JLYP,"In most cases, when it comes to movies based on books, I prefer the book over the movie.  Somehow text-based media always seems to lose something in the translation to the big screen, and oftentimes the filmmakers will make weird decisions regarding the source material -- they'll change an ending, eliminate an interesting character or subplot, add unnecessary material, or even completely change the content so that the film and book share little more than a title.  There are book-based movies I enjoy regardless of the fact that they are adaptations (""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""The Last Unicorn,"" ""Rise of the Guardians,"" etc.), but for the most part if I find a film is based on a book, I'll choose the book over the film.

""Holes"" is one of the rare exceptions.  Relatively little has been changed in the transition from page to screen, and despite its origin as an adaptation it still remains a slightly dark but quirky movie with a colorful cast of characters and a complex but entertaining web of interwoven plots.

Stanley Yelnats IV is the son of an inventor (whose current mission is to find out how to get rid of foot odor in athletic shoes), who's wrongfully convicted of a theft and sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention center in Texas.  Despite the picturesque name, Camp Green Lake is a miserable compound in the middle of the desert, and Stanley finds himself struggling to fit in with the other inmates and trying to avoid the attentions of both the guards, Mr. Sir and Mr. Pendanski, and the warden, a foul-tempered and sadistic woman who paints her nails with rattlesnake venom.  Each boy in the camp is required to dig one hole a day in the desert, five feet wide and five feet deep, on the grounds that hard labor is the best way to reform a ""bad boy.""  But Stanley suspects that there's more going on at Camp Green Lake than is visible on the surface, and with the help of fellow inmate Hector ""Zero"" Zeroni he sets out to solve the mystery of the camp... and discovers that it ties into his own past in ways he could never have imagined.

Like the book it's based on, ""Holes"" has several plots going on at once -- not just Stanley's trials and adventures at the camp, but the story of his ancestor who ""cursed"" the family, his great-grandfather who had an ill-fated run-in with notorious outlaw Kissin' Kate, and an interracial affair between a young schoolteacher and an onion farmer that turns the settlers of Green Lake against them.  It may require a second viewing to unravel all these plots and see how they connect together, especially if one hasn't read the book first.  But a patient viewer will be rewarded, as it's quite satisfactory seeing everything come together in the end.

The acting in this film is quite strong as well.  It's nice to see Shia LaBeof in his pre-Transformers days, before fame went to his head, and see that he is a genuinely good actor if given good material to work with.  John Voight is appropriately gruff and intimidating as Mr. Sir, and Sigourney Weaver is obviously having too much fun as the Warden, gleefully spitting out her lines and smacking around her fellow actors as the script permits.  (Rumor has it her daughter read the book and informed her she would be perfect as the villain -- and she was right.)

The film has some dark elements, and while it isn't overly graphic it doesn't shy away from the book's grittier elements -- teenage crime, adult greed and brutality, the dangers of the desert, even racism and its effects.  But it still has its own quirky sense of humor, both in one-liners from the characters and the sense of irony that permeates the film as the various subplots intertwine and/or bounce off each other.  The boys in the camp have a believable rapport between them, and the scenes with the kids are some of the best in the film.  The scenery shots of the Texas desert are desolate but oddly beautiful as well, providing the film's bright but bleak atmosphere.

If you enjoyed the book, you'll definitely like this movie.  It gets dark and gut-wrenching at times, and the multiple plots can be hard to follow at times, especially for younger viewers.  But if you like non-typical young-adult adventure and a quirky (if a little on the black side) humor, give this film a shot.  Recommended for ages 10 and up due to some frightening scenes and subject matter.",1365984000,,4367,4.635538261997406

It has a great storyline filled with adventure and humor with some great moments of perserverance and friendship. So many newer movies seem to feel they need quick constant motion to keep kids interested. Not this one yet my son didn't want to pause it for a bathroom break.

1475288,5,B00005JLYP,I wanted to show the differences from the movie and the book.  A great movie on its own but even better with the book.,1365033600,,118,3.9166666666666665
1475289,5,B00005JLYP,"My fourth graders LOVED this book, and the movie stayed true to the original story by Louis Sachar in many ways.  A great find!  My only critique is that I truly wished the main character could have been more like Stanley in the book, since he changed in many ways (both inside and out), but this was not portrayed in the film.",1364947200,,327,4.258064516129032
1475290,5,B00005JLYP,"Love it! DVD was authentic unlike a lot of things from resellers. I love this movie, it's bee. A favorite since about 5th grade :)",1364688000,,130,4.24
1475370,5,B00005JLYP,"We read the book and then watched the movie. My daughter loved it. The flashbacks might be confusing if you don't already know the plot, though.",1364428800,,144,4.576923076923077
1475371,4,B00005JLYP,"This is entertaining, as far as family movies go.  I have seen it several times, but still find myself enjoying the storyline everytime.",1364256000,,136,4.913043478260869
1475372,5,B00005JLYP,"We really like this movie! We thought we had it - but couldn't find it - and knew we didn't have it on blu-ray, so we bought this version.  It is great!  I think the casting in this movie is amazing - even though so many of the adult actors are people I'm very familiar with, they slip into their roles so well that I stop thinking of them as Henry Winkler or Sigourney Weaver and just enjoy the story.  This movie is a keeper - one we watch again and again - and this formatting of it is excellent! I recommend it to anyone.",1364169600,,525,3.980952380952381
1475373,4,B00005JLYP,I thought it was a fantastic movie .great movie to sit down with the kids and watch .both my kids read the book and they liked the movie as good as the book,1364083200,,156,3.757575757575758
1475374,5,B00005JLYP,My son had recently read the book so we watched the movie as a family. This movie has something in it for everyone. A good story and a good message. Characters are well developing and the acting is good.,1364083200,,203,4.230769230769231
1475375,4,B00005JLYP,I must confess that I have never read the book upon which this movie is based. The film itself though is light and fun. It weaves past and present together in order to tell the story two intertwined families. A great film for all ages.,1363910400,,235,4.2444444444444445
1475376,4,B00005JLYP,"This is just a fun, enjoyable film.  It is very well done with a good cast and unique story line.",1363737600,,97,3.85
1475377,5,B00005JLYP,My 9 year old son has read the book and he wanted the movie after watching it on television. He loves it!,1363737600,,105,3.8181818181818183
1475378,5,B00005JLYP,"The movie Holes, follows the book very closely. There are a couple of characters in the flashbacks to the 1800s who die in the book. In the movie, the characters still die, but the action is filmed in such a way that it is not too intense or violent for young viewers. I appreciated this since my six year old is really sensitive to intense action in movies.

The casting for this film was excellent. Who else could play the bad-ass female camp warden better than Sigourney Weaver? Shia LaBeof plays Stanley - he looks like a baby! I didn't realize that he had done much acting before the Transformers movies. He is great in this movie (way better than in Transformers, in my opinion. That is no doubt partly a function of scripting. It's hard to act well if the dialogue is crap. Anyway....)

Other actors you may recognize that are in this movie include Jon Voight, Patricia Arquette, Henry Winkler, and Dul Hill. This was a really fun movie and very faithful to the book. If you loved the book, you'll love the movie too.",1363478400,,1024,4.470588235294118
1475379,5,B00005JLYP,I buy a lot of dvd;s and they all seem to be shipped within a day or two of ordering. They almost all seem to work well and this dvd was good on both counts.,1363132800,,157,3.5142857142857142
1475448,5,B00005JLYP,My son enjoyed it immensely after reading the book the last few weeks before watching the movie.  The streaming from Amazon was flawless and came through wonderfully in HD.,1363046400,,172,4.931034482758621
1475449,5,B00005JLYP,We really should buy this movie as many times as we have watched it. It is a good one for family viewing.,1362528000,,105,3.8181818181818183
1475450,5,B00005JLYP,I love movies n when I saw the price for it. I said to myself that I have to have this movie. I love this movie a lot.,1362441600,,118,3.25
1475451,5,B00005JLYP,"I think the best part about this movie is that Sachar (the other) wrote the screenplay. The book is a tightly written plot of interlocking chain of events. Disturb one (change something) and the rest falls apart. While there are ""holes"" in the dry lakebed, and ""holes"" based on the order in which the story unfolds on screen, there are no holes in the execution of the story. As an avid reader, I do recommend you read the book first. Watching the movie is a great reward; and be sure to watch the music video!",1362182400,,510,4.378947368421053
1475452,5,B00005JLYP,I use this in school to go along with the book. it works will. I do not whish to but more woods in this.,1362182400,,104,3.375
1475453,5,B00005JLYP,Great movie for the whole family and also good book for the kids to read. I would recommend this movie to any family.,1362182400,,117,4.130434782608695
1475454,4,B00005JLYP,though Stanley is not at all how we pictured him. The adult character roles were a hoot. It was fun for my son and I to watch AFTER reading the book.,1361923200,,149,3.838709677419355
1475455,5,B00005JLYP,My son saw the movie in class and asked me to rent it and watch it with him.  We both loved it.,1361836800,,95,3.3181818181818183
1475456,5,B00005JLYP,this movie was such a great blast from the childhood for me i have this on vhs but since there out dated and hard too find now a days to be able to own this on dvd is just plain awesome,1361750400,,185,3.5365853658536586
1475457,5,B00005JLYP,Shia LaBeouf is amazing in this film.  Great family movie.  Very funny and a great story.  You will love the characters and definitely want to see the bad guys get in trouble. Highly recommend this movie.  One of my favorites growing up.,1361664000,,237,4.571428571428571
1475536,5,B00005JLYP,"This is the magic of Disney and the kind of films they should be focusing on. Not only is it a great old story, brought to life on the big screen, but it's got one hell of a cast. The young stars in this movie turned out to be much better off working on a film like this, rather than some ridiculous singing and dancing nightmare, that would have tight cast them. Shia LaBeouf is great as a troubled kid sent away to a work camp, where they uncover a hidden secret. Surprisingly thou, it's newcomer Khleo Thomas who steals the show. His story and background are so sad and he plays it so well, that you just want to hug him every time he opens his mouth. Veterans John Voigt and Sigourney Weaver bring experience to the film and really give the kids a strong example to follow now and in the future. Overall, this is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen, doing justice in bringing life to a great novel. I wish more of their films were like this!",1361577600,,954,4.190217391304348
1475537,5,B00005JLYP,"If only all kids movies were as good as this.  No teenage angst. Just an intact family dealing with real life with genuine love and commitment, wrapped up in light hearted humor.  And, as I said, a great story!",1361577600,,210,4.358974358974359
1475538,5,B00005JLYP,"Holes written  by Louis Sachar is an excellent book.  And the movie has an incredible Oscar lineup.
Both of my kids can't get enough of this movie.  The moral lessons are good and the movie is well acted.
The soundtrack is entertaining as well.  There is so much texture and depth to this movie.  Often the movie
can not do the book justince.  But not this case.  They weave the underlying subplotw beautifully and keep
the viewer interested.  I wish more movies were this good for my family!",1361232000,,492,4.511363636363637
1475539,4,B00005JLYP,ENjoyed this with the family recently. I especially liked how the movie was broken up into the different stories with everything movie towards the conclusion. Nicely done.,1361145600,,171,5.37037037037037
1475540,5,B00005JLYP,I like how it went back and forth in time and tied the hole story together. Another great family movie.,1361145600,,103,4.2
1475541,5,B00005JLYP,This was one of the best movies ever and it mostly lines up with the book the actors were amazing then actually singing amazing it was wonderful.,1361059200,,145,4.407407407407407
1475542,1,B00005JLYP,The movie itself was OK but my copy was horrible with lots of stop and skipped parts. Can I get a better copy?,1360972800,,110,3.8260869565217392

1475544,5,B00005JLYP,After my son read the book for his 6th grade reading assignment we rented the movie and it was exactly like the book. The movie really brought the book to life.,1360627200,,160,4.193548387096774
1475545,1,B00005JLYP,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Sigourney Weaver at her worst. If you would like to watch a good S.W. movie watch Copy Cat. It is for adults however. But this movie is not even good for kids.,1360195200,,205,4.024390243902439
1475647,5,B00005JLYP,My daughter loved it. she squeeled when she saw it. It arrived quickly also. Would buy it again in a heatbeat.,1359936000,,110,4.285714285714286

1475649,5,B00005JLYP,There is something about this movie that makes a teenage boy smile.  My nephew was totally into the movie and really enjoyed it; he eventually chose this movie to write a review on for a homework assignement.,1359763200,,208,4.621621621621622
1475650,4,B00005JLYP,Got this dvd because my class read the book.  It didn't come as quick as the others I had ordered but it was Christmas at the time and came from further.  It was in excellent condition. My students liked comparing it to the book.,1359676800,,229,4.181818181818182
1475651,3,B00005JLYP,We first watched this on tv.  It was interesting enough to hold my attention and my children liked it.  I think it's mainly for tweens.,1359590400,,135,4.36

Buy it.",1359417600,,133,4.32
1475653,4,B00005JLYP,"Three stories going on at once, so I had a little trouble tying it all together. Over all, it was a good movie. I'd recommend reading the book first, so that you understand what's happeneing in the movie. A viewing audience of 13 & up will grasp the movie without prior knowledge. Be forewarned, there is very little (if any) humar, action, or adventure; mostly drama.",1359417600,,368,4.590909090909091
1475654,5,B00005JLYP,"My 11 year old son immediately nominated this film as one of his favorite movies (and my 9 year old daughter loved it too).

1475814,3,B00005JLYP,"This really was not my kind of movie but was better than I thought it would be.  It did have it's moments and had some really funny parts in it.  As it turned out, the mystery behind it all was better than anyone would know at the end.  You would just have to watch it to appreciate it.  Watching it makes you thirsty. I think most adults with a sense of humor will enjoy this movie.  At first I didn't think I would like it but I kept watching it so give it a chance.",1358726400,,468,3.8842105263157896

1476059,5,B00005JLYP,"We had low expectations because both of my children (now 10 and 12 yrs old) disliked the book. In fact, both chose not to finish it and they are avid readers with a pretty broad range of interests. The movie was something different. We liked that it was a unique story line. The acting was pretty good. They have been walking around for days saying ""Excuse me?"" which you will understand after you watch the movie. We laughed, I cried (though that's pretty typical for me!), and we only slightly disagree on the number of stars. My kids say 4 and I say 5 because, as a parent, I also appreciated that there was no sexual content that was inappropriate as most movies nowadays have. That was worth an extra star to me :)",1356652800,,719,4.373134328358209

1476285,5,B00005JLYP,"Holes is about a young kid (named Stanley Yelnats- yes you can probably figure out the mysteriousness of the last name!) who happens to be in the wrong place and wrong time involving the supposed stealing of a pair of red and white sneakers, and upon being caught the judges gives him a choice between serving an 18-month jail sentence or going to detention camp in the desert where he does nothing but dig holes all day as a way to build character.

He chooses the camp and goes on a wild adventure involving a hidden treasure deep within the soil that was handed down from generation to generation.  This doesn't actually happen until later though- for the first half of the film poor Stanley has to persevere the dreaded desert sun and work his hands right into a callus factory.

The storyline is pretty good and plays a more significant role than it would seem initially.  I mean at first the movie felt like just another ordinary adventure with a kid who's not exactly accepted with open arms from his other camp mates upon arrival (and has to gradually gain some respect by doing outrageous things).  And... to an extent that's pretty much how the storyline unravels.  Hey it's not supposed to be anything cutting edge.

The storyline constantly switches back and forth between the boys past generation and the current one, which doesn't exactly start out on a very appealing note but the one segment with the blonde-haired lady basically giving up and allowing these dangerous yellow-bellied lizards to bite and ultimately kill her, is a highlight.  The best segments are the ones where the camp counselor (who's a crazy gun-slinging cowboy) and Staney Yelnats get involved in hilarious adventures.  Later on a quiet boy named Hector becomes a more frequent character and befriends Stanley.  They set out on their own adventures to get away from all the dirt-digging that surprisingly takes up quite a bit of storyline.

Yellow belly lizards, foot cramps from digging and shovel workouts, and a quest to find treasure is what this movie is all about... and it's awesome.  Oh and Henry Winkler's odor-destroying experiments pertaining to shoes are really memorable as well (though truth be told, they were sort of undeveloped and infrequent but nonetheless hilarious).",1346630400,,2275,4.895833333333333

1476365,5,B00005JLYP,"Great movie!

We recently read (and reviewed) HOLES by Louis Sachar and set off to watch the film.  Unfortunately, I failed in recording the movie to the DVR.  Lucky for me, Walden Pond Press/Walden Media has some of the nicest people!  A friend at Walden found out The 9 Year Old and I were reading the book, and she sent over the DVD!

We loved HOLES!!  We are already on our third viewing!

First, the casting was perfection!  For anyone who watches the movie adaptation of any book, you know this is the key to making or breaking the film.  Shia LaBouf, Sigorney Weaver, Patricia Arquette and Jon Voight anchor this cast, which also includes rock solid actors like Henry Winkler, Tim Blake Nelson, Siobhan Fallon, and Eartha Kitt.  But I think it's the boys that made this movie work - Armpit, ZigZag, Twitch, Magnet, X-Ray and especially Zero were played brilliantly.  Not to mention, Mr. Louis Sachar makes an appearance in the movie as well as Mr. Collingwood!

One of the things that can also make or break a movie is the soundtrack.  At times,  I wanted to rewind the movie, just to listen to the song again!  One of the songs in the soundtrack is performed in part by the boys in the cast.  It's a great song, you can check out part of the video (with clips of them in the recording studio) of the D-Tent boys singing Dig It.

I just have to laugh.  We have recently seen trailers, television shows or movies with Jon Voight, and every time The 9 Year Old sees him, he says, ""It's Mr. Sir!""  Mr. Voight, for all of your memorable and brilliant roles, in our house, you will, from this point forward, be known as Mr. Sir.

Read the book.  See the movie.  In that order.  You will not be disappointed!  (Might even make a great gift set for the Middle Grader in your life!!)",1323302400,,1782,4.395705521472393

Anyway one boy is sent there for punishment. The cast of kids are first rate with nicknames like armpit etc. There is a lot of humor but there is also a serious side. The film goes back to another time period when the area was a prosperous town and local legends like Kissin Kate Barlow were around. There is also a seriousness to the story of prejudice and history in that location. But the story seems to come together better than you would believe thanks to the screenwriter and author, Louis Sachar.

Holes, the Movie

  The Movie, Holes, to me, is quite possibly one of the Greatest Allegories to the Gospel that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Every time I watch it, I am amazed that almost every scene preaches a different sermon. From the very start this Movie jumps right into Biblical symbolism and allegory. In the opening scene we see something that to me speaks of the prophecy in Genesis.

Genesis 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

  The Movie starts out with `Zero' played by Khleo Thomas, stealing a pair of tennis shoes that belong to Clyde 'Sweetfeet' Livingston, a well known sports figure. When Zero is pursued by the police, he throws the shoes off a bridge and they land on Stanley Yelnats IV, played by Shia LaBeouf. Stanley pays the price for Zero's crime. To me, this speaks allegorically to Zero's sin being laid upon Stanley. For his crime, the judge sends Stanley to a labor camp for troubled teens to build his character, and as fate would have it, Zero is there too. God uses our sufferings to conform us to the image of Christ, and this definitely builds our character.
  At the camp there is a psychologist, Dr. Pendaski, who is all about how you feel. To me this speaks to the modern day drive of many to preach a Gospel that has been largely reduced down to how it makes one feel. Some have referred to this as the ""Therapeutic Gospel."" I am sure, that to those that have been martyred for their faith, the ""Therapeutic Gospel"" is not very amusing.
  Stanley, is the Christ figure, he bares Zero's sin, and when Zero runs away into the desert, Stanley goes after him. Stanley finds Zero under an upside down boat. A Traditional Sanctuary is usually built like an upside down Arch, symbolizing that Jesus is our Arch. Under the boat, Zero is drinking fermented peach preserves, which is a wine that he calls sploosh. When they go in search of water, they find it at a place in the desert called God's Thumb, which is attached to His Hand. I find this symbolic because in God's Hand they find sanctuary from the desert. They also find white, sweet onions, symbolizing the Eucharist. In essence, with the sploosh and onion, they have communion. In the desert their is dragon like lizards, symbolizing our enemy. Because they feasted on all of the onions, the lizards don't bite them.
  Warden Walker, played by Sigourney Weaver, plays a cruel taskmaster, like a Satan figure. She is so mean that she is not only trying to steal the Yelnats' family inheritance, but she mixes rattlesnake venom in her fingernail polish. When she strikes ""Mr. Sir,"" played by Jon Voight, in the face, the venom produces a very painful and inflamed wound. To me, this is an allegory to the fall. For centuries the Church has likened the Fall of Adam, to Satan putting his fangs into the hearts of mankind.
  Stanley Yelnats III, young Stanley's father, played by Henry Winkler, is an example of someone that is obsessed with finding a formula that will eliminate odor in shoes. When we see his home, there is a huge kettle on the stove full of tennis shoes. The kitchen table, the laundry steam press table, and the ironing board, are all covered in tennis shoes. This is relevant because being made in God's image we are imprinted with our gifts, calling and talents in us. Sometimes we feel driven to do certain things along the lines of our career, service, hobby or calling. For example, a missionary feels at home in the mission field, a race car driver feels at home driving fast, and a teacher feels like he is accomplishing a very worthwhile service when he teaches. I feel like I am missing something when I don't see the authors underlying theme in a Movie ! These are all examples of God's gifts and talents being ingrained in us.
  Another interesting theme is the curse through the fall of Adam and Eve, being handed down from generation to generation. Stanley Yelnats IV, is the fourth descendant in a line of men that seem to be living under a curse put on their great grandfather by Zero's great grandmother, Madame Zeroni.

Exodus 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear [the guilty]; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.

  The curse is broken in the end when Stanley IV, and Zero get the inheritance. Throughout the Bible, there are many references to mankind be born under the fall of Adam, the curse that is broken through Christ.

Galatians 3:13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:

  In the fall the ground was cursed too, in the Movie, the land that they are living on, use to be a thriving lake. When the Movie culminates, Zero's criminal file disappears, symbolic of redemption because his record of his sin is gone. The whole camp, that had been very hateful to each other, is now rejoicing and loving each other, and it starts raining upon the lake that had been a dried up for generations. The land got healed too. One of the tough guy characters, called Armpit, asks Stanley to please call his mother and tell her that he loves her. You see in their redemption, Stanley and Zero are set free.",1302739200,,5433,4.563786008230453

1476527,5,B00005JLYP,"Meet Stanley Yelnats the 4th (Shia LaBeouf).  He comes from a long line of Stanley Yelnats', and they were all unlucky, well, ever since his no-good-pig-stealing ancestor forgot to make good on a deal with a gypsy in the old country and suffered from the resulting curse.  Now, many years later the unluckiness continues as Stanley is in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he is convicted of a crime he didn't commit and is bundled off to Camp Lake Greenwood, a Texas youth correctional facility.  The boys there are forced to dig one hole in the old lake bed each day.  The hole has to he the diameter of a shovel handle length and the same depth.

It never rains at Camp Greenwood, and hasn't for the 100-years or so since the murder of an innocent man by a group of vigilantes during the days of the old west.

Anyway, to sum up, this film uses amazing backflashes to the old country and to the old west and then back to today when we follow the mishaps of Stanley and the other boys at the camp.  And if you watch you will be treated to colorful characters like ""Kissing Kate Barlow"", an old west outlaw who only kissed the men she killed, Madame Zarone - an old gypsy woman, Elya Yelnats, Stanley Yelnats I-IV, Zero, X-Ray, Warden Walker who's grandfather once owned Lake Greenwood, as well as ""Mr. Sir"" the warden's enforcer, and ""Mother"" the camp counselor.

This is a wonderful film for people of all ages.  In fact, we recently watched this film as a family, including a middle school student, a HS student, my wife and I, and grandma.  Everyone enjoyed it...as a matter of fact my HS son (a football player) picked the film.

The movie is rated as PG but there are curse words here and there - like D***.  I think this could these could have been left out in a PG movie.

1476531,2,B00005JLYP,"I am sure this sounds like a broken record in regards to movies based on books, but the book was soooo much better.

The main story is that of Stanley Yelnats, a teen who is mistaken charged with stealing a pair of shoes and is sent to a work camp where the only task each day is digging a single hole.  Through the story we learn of Stanley's family history complete with a family curse that brings bad luck, the story of a turn-of-the-century school teacher and her taboo relationship with a black handyman, and other seemingly disjunct storylines that the author ultimately ties together to build a amazingly well crafted book.

What I especially loved about the book and hated about the movie was the author does such an amazing job of weaving together the different stories without beating the reader over the head to find the connections.  The author puts out a clue (like someone's last name in an early chapter) and then later tells a story featuring another character with the same last name.  If the reader gets it then great, but the author makes the reader do the work of remembering the clue from earlier and drawing the connection.  The movie lacks this subtlety.  In typical Hollywood fashion, it replays earlier scenes and dialogue to ensure everyone makes the connection.

Had I not enjoyed the book so much, I probably would have never even watched the movie; however, knowing there are people out in the world who haven't read the book and only have the movie to go on makes me sad.

Do youself a favor and forgo the movie in favor of the book.

What a delightful surprise we got! The movie, based on the equally wonderful book by Louis Sachar, is an oddball tale about a bunch of oddball people. Stanley Yelnats comes from a long line of losers who blame their lackluster lives on a family curse. Adolescent Stanley, wrongly convicted of stealing a pair of sneakers, is sent to the ironically named Camp Green Lake, a work camp where juvenile delinquents are rehabilitated based on the dubious theory that a bad boy can be turned into a good boy by being forced to dig deep holes in the hot sun all day. Stanley meets Zero, an illiterate, homeless misfit, and the two of them embark on a strange adventure involving poisonous lizards, a bandit called Kissin Kate Barlow, a lipstick tube, and some antique canned peaches.

This camp is no picnic, and as Stanley (aka Caveman) makes his adjustment to his new sentence, he seems to learn not only about himself and his family's past, but makes an important friendship with Zero.

One of the film's main points was Stanley forming a friendship with Zero. Stanley, who is an outcast of sorts when he enters Camp Greenlake, helps Zero, who many believe to be stupid because he is illiterate, how to read. Stanley makes the most of a bad situation by gaining this friendship, and he learns that family curses are more myth than truth.

Disney does a great job making this a great kid's film also, as many of the scenes that could have been objectionable were done with tact. Therefore, this is a ""safe"" film for kids to view. Overall, very impressed and glad that Disney brought this young adult novel to life on the big screen.",1243641600,,1496,4.702290076335878
1476642,2,B00005JLYP,"I read the novel ""Holes"" shortly after Louis Sachar published the novel. I really thought the novel was well written and interesting. Was it a Stephen King type of work? Well, no. But it was an interesting and different kind of story.

  Now I realize it would be difficult to loyaly translate the book into film. However, the novel's mood could be (but was not) replicated in the film. Now, this was likely designed to ""Disneyize"" the film for young audiences (like three year olds). Yet, I think it ruins the seriousness of the work. For example, is there really fear is the film? Is there an accurate portrayal of poverty? In my opinion, the actors created too flowery an environment with too many smiling faces (of wealthy young Disney actors) and too little fear.

  Furthermore, the bad-guys in this film are like most Disney villains - stupid, incompetent, worthless, and always idiotic during the most inopportune times (because eight year old like the satisfaction of knowing they are smarter than the villains).

Some changes the film made that really annoyed me were:

1. The cliff-climbing scene - far too unrealistic and many teenage students I asked also noticed this scene was overexagerated/overdramatic.

2. While some of the flashback scenes were very interesting, others were lame and did not appeal to the intellect or the emotions. Of course, the music sequence probably did not help create a serious mood either.

3. The actor who placed Stanley Yelnats, Shia LaBouf, was not very effective. Now, the role was very difficult to play correctly for numerous reasons including that Stanley SHOULD HAVE lost a lot of weight at Camp Green Lake as the film progresses (and become much tanner). Therefore, you should have had an actor who actual DUG holes (for at least a few days). It would have allowed for a lot more sympathetic acting afterwards during the hole digging scenes.

Furthermore, the long hair just does not work. You are in the desert. It is hot. As much as the actors in the film probably did not want to lose their hair for fear of losing their girlfriends, it is difficult to place the right mood when the film does much to undervalue the imagination of the book reader.

4. If the film is for adults and teenagers, be honest. Show true hardships, true hatred, true cunning on the part of criminals. Do not make Mr. P into some kind of former criminal idiot who tries to play Dr. Phil and gets in trouble at the end of the film because he is not authorized to carry a firearm because of past criminal activity. It takes away from the story-line. It makes it seem that the government (and everyone in it) is completely incompetent.

When I read the novel, I saw the Warden, Mr. Sir, Mr. P and everyone else put on an intelligent show (in my mind) - pretend (effectively) that the camp was not a labor camp. The film is non-sequitur in this regard.

5. Camp Green Lake is a large camp. It is not run by just a Warden, Mr. Sir , and Mr. P. It is run by many other people also. Furthermore, there are many more teenage boys at the camp that then film portrays. Obviously, the idea is to simplify the complex for children. Yet, since this is the case, ""Does not the flashback scenes create some problems for young children to follow?""

In short, the major theme of the book (and film if you can understand it) is that the Zeroni and Yelnats familes come together again. The Yelnats wronged the Zeroni family many years prior and Stanley becomes the Yelnats who rights the wrong through his friendship with Zero Zeroni (Khleo Castro).

There are other subplots, also (some of which the film covers well and others the film does not cover effectively).

Therefore, as a whole, I was looking for more ""Stand By Me"" and less ""Home Alone.""",1236816000,,3764,4.627627627627628

The wonderful model of a fair teacher, teaching the beauty of poetry, then commits suicide on screen after the sheriff says he loves a good lynching as the only black character in the movie suffers the slings and arrows of the time.

Please understand that for my son and I it was a great movie to stop at the constant barrage of deceit, unthinking injustice and poor choices of figures in authority. We'll wait at least till he's 12 to go into the adult themes.  I'm amazed the folks that have signed on in this leporasity of a film because of the kids that don't get the benefit of Rafe Esquith's ideal of guided childhood.  I was first introduced to this film as an acclaimed teacher of my THIRD grader was letting me know of ""film day"" after completion of the Texas state wide TAKS test.  And this passes for Disney family entertainment?  Rather more like didatic Kubrick or Scorsese.  Only after registering the above points and a screening with the principal was the film pulled on the grounds of unchallenged immorality.

PG-13 does not mean an adult is in the room when the movie is running, rather that points of good and bad ideas are expressed as they happen.  The bite of the rattler in the opening scene reminds me of Naomi Klein's  Shock and Awe techniques we suffer without really understanding.

The blend of dogged realism and luminous magic is just enchanting, and all the actors -- from the young crew in D Tent to the marvelous Dule Hill, Jon Voigt, Sigourney Weaver, Patricia Arquette, and others -- do a wonderful job. Jon Voigt is especially memorable as the mean-talkin', cock-eyed, reptilian ""Mr. Sir.""

Some, of course, will find changes to a book they love disappointing. But every book becomes something just a little different when it is transferred to the screen. Even with the participation of the book's author, ""Holes"" is no exception to this rule. For example, in the book the palindromic protagonist -- Stanley Yelnats -- goes from chubby to thin under the rigors of ""Camp Green Lake."" The film-makers explain (in the informative ""Special Features"" part of this DVD) that this transformation was impossible under the harsh desert conditions where the movie was made. Not only would it have been physically dangerous for the young actor, but action had to be shot out of sequence, so there was no way to record his shaping up as part of the linear narrative. Given its achievements the film can certainly be forgiven for its liberties with the text.

Although this is billed as a movie for children, it can be appreciated by viewers of any age. In fact, the somewhat complex plot might be hard to follow for really young children.",1146614400,,1382,4.827004219409282

But the premise doesn't reveal the fact that the Universe is trying to wrong a hundred-year-old curse brought upon the main character's family by his great grandfather. And, the Universe is making the warden pay for the wrongs her family had committed a Century ago.

Shifting between past and present increases the richness of the story (and makes it confusing for a six year old) and allows for a very satisfying resolution.

  Stanley Yelnats IV goes to Camp Green Lake, a jail for young people.  There's no lake at Camp Green Lake, it dried up a long time ago.  Instead of a lake, there are countless holes.  If a boy digs holes all day, that'll turn him into a good boy...according to Mr. Sir (played superbly by John Voight).  The Warden of Camp Green Lake is none other than Sigourney Weaver.  Why are the kids digging holes (which is 5 feet across and 5 feet deep) in the middle of a dry lake bed?  Well, I leave to fill up the holes yourself",1137283200,,618,4.083333333333333
1476859,5,B00005JLYP,"This was a great movie that I watched with my nephews. It was my favorite book for a long time; I have read and seen Holes so many times. I read the book for the first time in seventh grade and bought it when I found it. I have also lent it to people because it's such a great story to me. When I heard the movie was coming out I was excited, I saw it at the movies when it first came out then bought it. One reason the movie is so great is because the director did such a great job on making the movie to be so much like the book. That's important because if you change anything, it would throw off the whole story. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who first, loved the book, and second, to people who like fun twists in stories.

A reason this stories so fun, is because it's about kids who think they're all better than the next. This is very amusing to see little kids try and think they're ""all that"" when in reality, they are just making themselves look stupid. They also try to make up ""cool"" nicknames, that turn out to be quite childish, like ""Armpit"" and ""Zigzag,"" but they insist on being called by them. The things they fight about are so hilarious as well. For instance, when Stanley finds the fossil and they all thinks it's not cool except ""Armpit."" Another is X-ray, how he decided on his own that he's the leader and makes places in line for all of them.

  In addition to all this, something that's really amazing is that it has three different stories that all become one. This is fascinating because they are so diverse, but still so connected. The first story is all about Stanly 3rd, who was sent to a juvenile camp for a wrongfully convicted crime. While there he meets new friends and finds an old, odd relation. This was Zero. His story is with Stanley's, but he was a descendant of Stanley's great-great-grandfathers fortune teller, Madam Zeroni. In that story Elia Yelnats, Stanley's great-great-grandfather, wished to merry so Madam Zeroni helped, but in return he was to carry her up a mountain and sing to her while drinking from a stream. He was unable to merry this woman, and ran away to America leaving Madam Zeroni, so she cursed him and his descendants with bad luck. The last story that's portrayed is of Miss Katherine. She was a southern school teacher who had secretly fallen in love with a black man and kissed him; which was illegal for her lover at that time. When Trout Walker, the Wardens grandfather, found out he was furious and jealous, so he told the sheriff and the man was killed causing Miss Katherine to go crazy and become a murderer and thief. The way all of these odd stories come together is that the Warden is looking for the treasure Kissin' Kate Barlow, the outlaw teacher, had stolen from Stanley's great-grandfather, so she was having the children dig holes for her. Then the story with Zero and Stanley's family is the curse, which Stanley lifts be carrying Zero up a mountain and singing an old family song. It's quite interesting and amusing to see and have to learn as you go.

This is such a great film with lots of hilarious scenes and characters. It had many stories that all intertwined to make a great plot. I think anyone would love the movie Holes and find it a fun watch with family, friends, or even alone.",1134604800,,3298,4.417763157894737
1476860,5,B00005JLYP,"I think Holes is one of the best family-friendly movies that I've seen in the past few years. In the age of questionable jokes working their ways into family-marketed movies, I think any parent with a child over the age of 7 could feel comfortable with their kids watching this movie, as well as enjoy it themselves. It addresses issues such as greed and bigotry and rehabilitation of those deemed ""hopeless"" and the true meaning of friendship

and perserverance without being preachy and too ""after-school-special."" I think adults can enjoy this movie alot, too- there's something timeless to the heart of this movie.

I personally enjoyed the pacing and how the flashbacks were done. A lot of movies get mired up in flashbacks, the flashbacks go on too long, tell too much story, but Louis Sacher did a great job with weaving the 3 different stories into one. I loved that the script was serious, but still funny. The humor was cute and subtle and the characters were very three-demensional and all very dynamic, even the villians.

I especially enjoyed seeing Eartha Kitt playing Madame Zironi. I thought she was a great addition to the cast with her character. Another thing that I felt was a character in itself was the lake. It was this beautiful, bustling little city in Texas that turned into a dry wasteland after a horrible act of greed, jealousy and hatred destroyed lives.

I first read Louis Sacher books when I was 7-8 years old,and they were quite funny, but difficult for me. I hadn't picked up any of them since. I saw this movie about a year ago and I am quite impressed with Mr Sachar, now.

The only scenes which are included in the movie but not written originally in the book are quite strongly implied in the book and need elucidation in the screenplay version. I have never seen a movie that stuck so amazingly close to the book from which it was taken, and so beautifully followed the descriptions within the book, making it a rich experience for those with vivid imaginations. When I first saw Mr. Sir, I was taken aback -- he looked EXACTLY like I had imagined. The rest of the characters were just the same.

For general quality, it deserves the highest rating one could give. The acting is superb, especially when you consider it was done by a group of teenaged boys, the script is delightful, much of it taken word-for-word from the book, and there is very little objectionable material: a perfect family movie. There's a great balance of mystery, suspense, and humor (in particular, the thread of Elya and Madame Zeroni is comically hyperbolic, reflecting the comically hyperbolice way that ""Caveman's"" grandfather looked at life), with the book's intricate play of symbolism.

I read the book about two years ago, and the appearance of a movie didn't excite me much, but now having watched it twice in a row this week, I can say nothing but that I was extremely impressed.",1123200000,,1353,4.753191489361702

Now, there were some differences, for one: Stanley Yelnats in the book was overweight but in the movie he was not because the people who created the movie said it would be near impossible to find a overweight kid who would actually toughen up and lose weight in the movie, but that's okay. The movie was great, just as the book. So, if you like the book, you'll more than likely also like the movies.

Now onto the actors! lol...they all did great and pretty much every guy in D-Tent was hot or good looking! (Jake M. Smith ""Squid"" being the hottest followed closely by Ricky Kasch ""Zig Zag"" which makes sense since Zig Zag, Squid, and Zero-who was also cute, go Khleo!-were my fave characters in the book as well, and Brenden Jefferson ""X-Ray"" was pretty cute without his big foggy glasses, lol...and Shia of course!) So yeah, the actors were cute too, which is a plus.

But onto the other actors, I think that Tim Blake Nelson was absolutely the PERFECT Pendanski, he mastered that role and not that I knew who he was before this movie but I pictured him to look just like TBN did! Jon Voight was pretty good as Mr. Sir but at times over-the-top and Sigourney Weaver did a good job as the Warden, just like Patricia Did a good job as KKB.

Davis, normally a director of such vague action fare as The Fugitive and Collateral Damage, here turns in a surprisingly good coming-of-age tale. The story centers around Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LaBeouf, longtime star of Even Stevens), a kid who's always in the wrong place at the wrong time thanks, he thinks, to a family curse. Wrongly convicted of stealing a baseball star's shoes that had been donated to charity, Yelnats is sent to a work camp instead of jail. Cue ""large numbers of boys coming of age at the same time"" music here. What the boys do at the work camp is quite simple: they dig holes. Their taskmaster is the incongruously named Mr. Sir (Jon Voight, looking younger than he has in a decade), who is constantly at odds with the camp's counselor, Dr. Pendraski (Tim Blake Nelson in his best role since O Brother, Where Art Thou?). They all answer to the mysterious warden (Sigourney Weaver), who takes quite an interest in those holes-- or what's found in them. Paralleling Stanley's plot are two other tales, the story of how the curse was laid on the family by Madame Zeroni (Eartha Kitt), and the tale of Kissin' Kate Barlow (Patricia Arquette), the first person to actually visit the curse on the Yelnats family, by relieving Stanley I of his fortune not long after he came to America.

Louis Sachar, adapting his own novel, has created a fine cast of characters who actually have depth to them, and put them into (relatively, anyway) believable situations, allowing us to care about their various fates. His bad guys are mostly sympathetic, his good guys not without their flaws, and everyone acts pretty much in character. Though there was one glaring failing of the script: if I were a teenaged boy, and I were at a prison camp where the warden looked like Sigourney Weaver, I wouldn't have ignored that fact in the way these kids do.

Who knew Andrew Davis had it in him? Not me. Holes is an exceptional picture, and not at all just a kids' movie. Worth your time. *** ",1112227200,,2023,4.658263305322129

He FOUND a pair of shoes belonging to a famous basketball player. He then believes that it is because his family is said to have a curse. That is because one of his ancestors made a mistake when he made a deal with an unusual fortune teller.

What I Liked:

1)  Plot.  The plot is fun and original.  It isn't just about kids digging holes in the desert.  It's a lot more than that as character is build, friendships are formed, and family is most important.

2)  Story Line.  There is one main story line but then a couple more are being shown as well.  And in the end, they all meet up in one place.  It isn't every day that a story is wrapped up so nicely, but this one nails it perfectly.

3)  Mostly Family Friendly.  There is a little bit of children fighting and one unnecessary scene of violence.  However, I never felt uncomfortable having my young son watch this movie.

4)  Comedy.  There is some things in here that will make you laugh out loud.

5)  Acting.  The acting of Jon Voight is a bit over the top, but other than that this has some great acting... especially by the children of the movie.  The children actors nail their parts head on.  And Henry Winkler... you've gotta love the Fonz!!!!

I would highly recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good story to watch.  This has every aspect of a movie.  It is based on a book I have not read, but it is on my list of books to eventually get to.",1108857600,,1399,4.216730038022813
1476948,5,B00005JLYP,"HOLES is a movie that not only captured my attention, but left me wanting more as the end credits started rolling. This is a rare occurance for me - normally I'm pretty fidgety in the movie theatre, but from the second the movie started to the end of the credits, I was interested.

When I first heard that they were going to make my favorite young adult book into a movie, I was a bit doubtful. I didn't want to see the ""Hollywood"" version of a book that I've read countless times, but after seeing the previews, I knew I would go see it. I saw HOLES in theatres three times, and bought the DVD on the day it came out.

HOLES is one of the best book to movie transitions I have ever seen. The characters, scenery, and stories are all exactly how they are imagined, and it's hard not to fall under the spell that the cast creates (the fact that the boys were pretty much unknown added to this - had they used well-known actors, it would be a lot different, in my opinion). The extras on the DVD are great as well - commentary by some of the cast (this is probably my favorite extra, as it had me laughing all the way through), deleted scenes, and a gag reel.

HOLES is a story of love, friendship, family, truth, racism, and loyalty. Somehow, it conveys the messages without being cliched or preachy, and it's a family movie that kids, teenagers, and parents can all enjoy.

Highly recommended.

No, children in the West are not treated unfairly, they get to go to school until they are adults, they occupy vast swathes of public and private space and contrary to the Hole's myth, they are well protected by the law.

By contrast, their third world cousins loose limbs to land mines manufactured in the West, are shot in the streets of Falluja because they might grow up to be a terrorist, die of AIDS and other preventable diseases like malaria in their hundreds every day, orphaned in their millions, subjected to genital disfigurement, work in conditions that make chimney sweeping in Victorian England seem like a plumb job and are recruited at gunpoint and trained to hack off their neighbours faces.

And what about Zero and Armpit, what message should we draw from their roles in the film? Latin boy Zero strangles some Anglo looking kid (or is he Ukranian?) and so it follows that white, Protestant America is being strangled by the brown, Catholic South. Then there's Armpit, that wide dark continent really is on the nose.

1477063,3,B00005JLYP,"The problem with this film is that it entrenches already perilously misleading fallacies about good and 'evil', fate, fortune, retribution and justice, with a smug arrogance that leaves a vile taste in one's mouth.

The ostensibly wicked and evil character of the film, for the most part, is the warden of a kid's 'detention centre' who drives the kids to dig holes endlessly in the search for a missing piece of the past. At the end of the film this missing piece of the past is discovered instead by a snotty and ignorant boy. Distraught and destroyed, she asks to simply see inside the box. It is her one wish and what she has spent her life devoted to satisfying.  'Excuse me?' he asks, incredulous and walks away, dismissive and inflated with self importance.

We are, I presume, supposed to think, 'Haha. She got what she deserves...yay happy ending'. But it is exactly this kind of mindless stereotyping which is a cause for concern. It subscribes to the ferocious school of thought which demands those of us in society who make mistakes deserve the most severe punishment. The warden is very much a product of her upbringing and she hasn't really done anything that bad to anyone. The boys are, after all, felons in a juvenile prison. That she has been driven insensible by the need to recover this piece of the past not really all her fault. But who seems to care? The smug self satisfied irritation who tells her to get lost cetainly doesn't. He just enjoys kicking people when they are down and we are expected to cheer him for it. Where is  compassion for human weakness? Where is an understanding of the inherent weakness of the human heart? And what, most disturbingly, is this appalling need have to teach our children to gloat at the defeat of our enemies?

The simple and stupid celebration at the end of the film advocates a misleading reality. It argues that there is a kind of justice in the world, where the superfically deserving come good and the wicked are punished. Life doesn't work that way. Dreams don't come true. More often than not the deserving are left to suffer and justice is, in so many small uncontested battles in our lives, left unserved.

I'd heard the generally positive reviews and read what passed for plot synopsis, but all I came away with was, ""What?!?"" This is a difficult movie to synopsize without giving away too much of the intricately woven plot. If this is what young teen-agers are reading, there may be hope for us yet.
This is a movie that requires constant attention. The plot is revealed in fits and starts with modern day action intercut with flashbacks and clues in plain view at the periphery of the scenes. The story is about the  bad luck Yelnats clan, all of which leads to the youngest family scion, Stanley (his first and last name together are a palindrome). There are actually five interrelated subplots:
1) The origin of the family curse.
2) The history of the site of the juvenile detention camp where the protagonist finds himself. This takes place in the old west.
3) A story of Stanley's great-grandfather, who made a fortune and then lost it in events which touch on plot #2.
4) The story of the camp warden and her family. This also relates to plot #2.
5) The modern day plight of Stanley and his family.
Sound complicated? It is, but it all entwines in some exceptional storytelling. The ending wraps up all five stories in an entirely satisfying way.
So what is this and who would like it? Well, it's not a children's movie in any conventional sense. It requires attention and doesn't have a lot of ""action"". It's not riveting, but it is masterful storytelling. The film makers don't milk any scenes beyond their logical conclusion, so the intercutting between modern events and flashbacks could be disorienting to some viewers. The performances are all first rate. Jon Voigt is over the top as the dim-witted head guard, and Sigourney Weaver has her most deliciously evil role since ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"". The juvenile roles are all excellent, especially the critical roles of Shia LaBeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as ""Zero"". Eartha Kitt turns in a brief but effective performance as the old Latvian Gypsy who started the family curse. Patricia Arquette and Dul Hill are touching in the critical roles as tragically star-crossed interracial lovers in the old west.
If you let it, this is a highly involving film and time well spent.

1477127,2,B00005JLYP,"Based on the Louis Sachar novel, ""Holes"" plays like a cutesy version of ""Cool Hand Luke"" for the Outward Bound set.
Stanley is a good-natured kid who is wrongly convicted of stealing shoes from a homeless shelter.  As punishment, he is shipped off to a strange correctional facility in
the desert where he and the other boys are forced to dig endless holes for no purpose beyond ""character building.""  The place is run by a trio of certifiable sadistic nitwits played by Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson, all of whom overact shamelessly in their roles.
""Holes"" is obviously intended to be a clever, original film, combining elements of humor, social commentary and Magic Realism in a satirical attack on mindless injustice.  However, the humor is generally lowbrow and overbroad, the social commentary conventional and sentimental, and the Magic Realism so forced and heavy handed that it robs the film of any kind of real world relevance early on.  The adults in the film are all overdrawn caricatures while the boys are, for the most part, bland and utterly indistinguishable from one another.  The film is padded out with a series of interminable flashbacks involving a curse supposedly placed on Stanley's family as a result of the actions of his great grandfather.  However, this parallel back-story is even more corny and melodramatic than what is being served up front and manages only to slow down what little ""action"" there is even further.
Having never read the popular novel on which the film is based, I will be the first to concede that perhaps I just didn't get what was supposed to be going on here.  ""Holes"" may be fine for the aficionado and the already initiated, but it makes for a tediously bad time at the movies for the rest of us.",1081036800,,1770,4.802631578947368
1477128,4,B00005JLYP,"Many say the film ""Holes"" is good, and the original book is even better.  Though I have not read the book, I can sense the feelings these people have towards the beloved original.  And the film is carefully made with that kind of love, I think.  So, read this review as the one from a non-reader of Louis Sacher book, but as just a moviegoer.
One thing is certain; the kids featured in the central story are fantastic.  ""Holes"" starts with a boy Stanley Yelnats IV (read backward), who is falsely accused of stealing a pair of shoes presented by a celebrity.  Now Stanley must work at the correctional camp for boys.
The camp itself is very unique.  In the middle of the hot desert, Stanley has to dig a hole every day, to mould a newer and healthier character.  And while there, he meets another boy called Zero, with whom he becomes a friend, and embarks on another adventure, which ends in an unexpected way.
In the meanwhile, Stanley's family has been, he claims, cursed from the great-great-great-grand dad, who neglected a promise with an old lady Eartha Kitt.  Beside this sub-plot told in flashbacks, we have another sub-plot about the life of ""Kissin' Kate Barlow"" (Patricia Arquette).  These subplots, it will be clear, have something to do with the present-day story about Stanley and Zero.
But the charms of the film come from its characters.  Though Sigourney Weaver (as the warden of the camp) is top-billed in the film, it is the friendship between Stanley and Zero that really attacts us, and the good acting of the kids is strongly recommended.  This is not to say that Ms. Weaver is bad; but when we have to wait for one hour for her to appear, it is hardly possible to say that this is her movie.  You also get John Voight as the warden's second, and Tim Blake Nelson as ""doctor,"" plus Henry Winkler as Stanley's father.  They all give appropriately quirky and even crazy acting, in particular that of John Voight, who reminds me of his eccentric turn in ""Anaconda.""
The film is Disney's, and the company decided on an uncomfortable mixture of myth and reality.  Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"") is not the right choice for directing this kind material (it's Alfonso Cuaron) that requires more magical touch to make every scene edgy and mythical.
And Disney is guilty of one thing: too much polishing up.  The boys in the camp sometimes show nasty and mean attitude, but they are never evil; the violence is suggested (in the flashback), but not explicitly shown on the screen; Sigourney Weaver's warden should look more self-centered, but she actually lacks the menace this kind of character might have.  In short, the film is too clean, and it doesn't bite.  Even the dirt looks clean, and Sigourney Weaver's phoney droll accent comes and goes.
The last point is the sole reason of my star rating.  But the characters are interesting, and if you endure the first half of the film (in which too many flashbacks come and go), you will be slowly sucked into this strange world of ""Holes.""",1079568000,,3003,4.666034155597723
1477129,3,B00005JLYP,"If you want a live-action family film that adults and teens can tolerate but pre-teens will enjoy, HOLES might fit the bill.  Even though most of the action is set in a detention camp for young offenders, very little bad behavior is on display.  There's no cursing, nudity, sex, violence (other than a couple of shoving matches) or other material similarly objectionable for children.  The story is pitched at the average 10-year-old's level of sophistication, though even younger kids will get most of it, and the slow pacing is not so tedious as to prevent most adults from staying awake.
The production values and acting performances are generally first-class.  Grown-ups might even enjoy the adult performances more than kids--especially Jon Voight's over-the-top camp guard and Henry Winkler's goofball inventor.  Nevertheless, to award even three stars to this movie is rather charitable.  Perhaps the many 4 and 5 star ratings reflect approval of family-oriented features in general, rather than the quality of this particular film.

""Holes"" the movie may not be quite as satisfying - how could it be? - but it captures so many elements of the book that it feels like the pages have come alive. ""Holes"" the movie is funny, offbeat, surreal, deep, romantic, tense, adventurous, and thoroughly entertaining.
Shia LeBouf is, thanks to ""Project Greenlight,"" a cult hero now, and shows wonderful presence and poise as Stanley Yelnats, the boy from an odd household who is unfairly conficted of stealing an NBA great's shoes from a charity. He's sent to one of the more bizarre detention camps you can imagine, and the story begins.
Or rather, the story continues. We learn in an alternate story about a doomed interracial romance and a legend that seems to ring true, and we see how the sins of the past have led to this strange present. Director Davis cuts back and forth between these two threads with uncommon skill - we never feel like the thrust of the story is interrupted.
The performances are uniformly good. Tim Blake Nelson, Sigorney Weaver, and Jon Voight have all kinds of fun digesting the scenery, while the unknown band of boy convicts perfectly fill the richly-defined roles from the book.

1477222,4,B00005JLYP,"The film of Louis Sachar's ""Holes"" is faithful to his novel, especially since he also wrote the screenplay.
The basic story is that unlucky and cursed Stanley Yelnats is sentenced to Camp Green Lake for a crime he didn't commit. He can blame most of his bad luck on the curse handed down by his ""no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great grandfather"" Elya Yelnats, who emigrated from Latvia years before.
Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake and quickly discovers that there is no longer a lake and in fact there's nearly nothing but desert. There are plenty of holes, however, and each day each boy is required to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet in diameter. Digging the holes is supposed to build character, but the Warden, played nastily cool by Sigourney Weaver, has more sinister intentions.
As back story, we learn about Stanley's ancestor and how the curse was handed down from an ill-fated marriage proposal. There was also his great-grandfather who was robbed by the outlaw ""Kissin'"" Kate Barlow.
Another subplot shows Kate Barlow (Patricia Arquette) as a school teacher who commits the crime of falling in love with and kissing the town onion farmer (West Wing's Dule Hill) and then opening up the town's prejudice. There's a darkly tragic outcome.
All of these elements tie in together with the boy's ""character building"" hole digging. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the spotted yellow lizards. The ones in the movie kind of looked like the dilophosaurus from Jurassic Park that killed Nedry/Newman Wayne Knight. But I digress...
While the smaller roles of the adults filled by Weaver, Arquette, Hill, Henry Winkler, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson are faithful to the novel, it's Shia LaBeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero who really bring the story to life. Their flight across the desert and climb up the mountain to ""God's Thumb"" is the heart of the story and a great buddy journey. The other members of D-Tent are right on as well.
The only major change from the novel was that in the book Stanley was overweight and loses it doing the digging, which is hard to pull off in a movie. Also, the deleted scenes give a better idea of how his innocence was proven, which is pretty brisk in the regular theatrical version.
I recommend reading the novel first, then seeing the movie.",1075593600,,2312,4.811557788944723

The only thing that got me upset was the fact that this movie isn't exactly totally apropriate for kids. They swear a few times enough to make it PG-13.
The story is about Stanley Yelnats who is wrongly accused of stealing a celebritie's shoes. Instead of spending time in jail, he is sent to Camp Greenlake, a place out in the middle of nowhere. To make it more ironic, there is absolutely no water of any kind, not to mention a ""green lake"". The peculiar thing about this camp is that the kids are required to dig holes every day, apparently to ""build charector.""
Their are secrets around every corner, and the story is just so interesting. I love the fact that it all connects in the end and is so original. If you love the movie, try the book...it's even better!",1075507200,,943,4.273743016759776

I mean, how many people get hit with some sneakers falling out of the sky and are convicted of stealing them? How was Stanley supposed to know that the sneakers belonged to a famous baseball player? Of course, no one believes him and he has the choice of going to jail or to Camp Green Lake. Stanley has always wanted to go away to camp like other kids do, so he leaps at the chance to go to Camp Green Lake. But when Stanley arrives, he discovers that there is no lake at Camp Green Lake - there are just a bunch of holes.
It doesn't take Stanley long to figure out that there is more to Camp Green Lake than meets the eye. At first it is all Stanley can do to dig his 5 x 5 foot hole everyday and deal with the bad-tempered, sunflower-seed-spitting Mr. Sir (Jon Voight), the seemingly kind-hearted Mr. ""Mom"" Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson), the rattlesnake-venom fingernail polish of the Warden (Sigourney Weaver), the bizarre heirarchy of the boys led by X-Ray (Brenden Jefferson), and a host of other characters including Zero (Khleo Thomas), whom everyone believes is nothing. As Stanley spends time at Camp Green Lake, he learns more and more about himself and discovers that the camp really was successful in building his character...
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was fast & fun with quirky characters and four different stories tied together into one. The main story is the one of Stanley Yelnats IV and his experiences at camp, but we also follow the story of Stanley Yelnats I who was robbed in the middle of the desert and survived by using ""God's thumb"", there is Stanley's ""no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather"" who got him into this mess in the first place, and the sad story of Kissin' Kate Barlow, the notorious outlaw who robbed Stanley Yelnats I. These stories are creatively woven together and have lots of humor, sometimes dark humor, but the stories are quite funny all the same. If you enjoyed the movie, I highly recommend that you read the book because you will get to know more about the characters, but the director did a very good job at staying true to the book.

Today, I finished reading the book Holes for my daughter. If you want a good story that is well written and clever on top of being not very clich&eacute;, I highly recommend the BOOK. However, no matter the temptation, DO NOT BUY OR RENT THE MOVIE VERSION! The movie is terribly paced and only acted well on the part of three of the characters. John Voight, who plays a character called Mr. Sir, nearly saved several scenes. But, following the latest trends, Disney tried to blackify the story. The movie is crammed with poorly edited r&b and hip-hop music that is too loud and terribly out of place most of the time. In addition, the dialogue is something out of a nightmare of George Bush doing an impersonation of Vanilla Ice trying to be as black as one of the Beastie Boys. The story is changed enough that it loses just about all of its magic and wit. Also, it doesn't leave anything at all to your imagination.
The book, however, is fantastic. My daughter and I loved it thoroughly. It is imaginative, witty and well-paced. There is a good bit of clever humor. There is also sugar-free love, and well-measured danger. There are two violent scenes, but nothing that one can't handle, or explain in the context of the story. The Disney version, on the other hand, stuffs these scenes in to try to wake up those who fell asleep and do to the changes in pace, the scenes are much more gratuitous. In my opinion, there was no stereotyping in the book. But the movie was typical Disney casting which goes something like this:
Director: Let's go downtown and try to get a feel for what
the ""inner city"" is like. I want
this movie to feature real-life characters.
Casting director: But, isn't that dangerous?
Dircetor: Ya, you're right, maybe we'll just watch a couple of
hours of Menudo and try to
get a good grasp on the modern day lingo of today's
African American youth.
They do still prefer that term, right?
Casting Director: Yesiree, my brother!

1477314,3,B00005JLYP,"This is an enjoyable movie with a distinctive Disney feel to it.  It seemed a little slow in the middle but the plot was interesting and the ending heartwarming.  Two family curses intertwine in the arid West Texas landscape when Stanley Yelnats is sent to Lake Greenwood for stealing a pair of shoes which he, of course, did not actually steal.  This, he figures, stands to figure as all the males in his family have been cursed since his great, great grandfather failed to keep a promise to a gypsy soothsayer in the old country.
Lake Greenwood is not a lake but it used to be.  When a black man was shot in cold blood over a hundred years ago over a kiss from the white schoolteacher (Disney picks some strange stuff for their children's movies, don't they) a curse falls on the area and no rain falls from that day forward. The lake dries up and the family that owns it, now represented by Sigourney Weaver as the warden of Lake Greenwood, is digging holes.  Each child in the juvenile center is to dig one hole five feet deep and five feet wide every day.  Only Stanley can piece together what they are looking for but first he has to take care of his own family curse.",1074902400,,1174,4.362385321100917

1477317,4,B00005JLYP,"As HOLES begins, we see a dirty, sweat-drenched, young man emerge from a pit he's been digging in the desert. Apparently distraught over his prospects for job advancement, he bares a foot to the fangs of a passing rattlesnake. Yup, that's how I feel at the end of some workdays myself.
The hero of this quirky story is Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LeBeouf), unjustly convicted of stealing a pair of snappy looking athletic shoes. Stanley is at the leading edge of the bad luck that's bedeviled his family since an ancestor emigrated from Eastern Europe under the curse of a gypsy crone (Eartha Kitt). Yelnats is sentenced to the juvenile detention center of Camp Green Lake, a parched lake bed in the Texas desert, where the male inmates spend their days digging pits - five feet deep and five feet in diameter - in order to build character. They're under standing orders to bring anything unusual they unearth to the attention of the overseer, Mr. Sir (Jon Voight). However, ""unusual"" isn't defined except that, as Stanley discovers, it's not about fossils.
HOLES has so many varied elements that the viewer may wonder if it can all come together. The gypsy curse. Deadly, yellow-spotted lizards. An Old West schoolmarm turned outlaw, Kissin' Kate Barlow (Patricia Arquette). Something lost and buried. An elusive antidote for smelly shoes. Preserved peaches. A coming-of-age story. Lots of holes.
But come together it does. LeBeouf is ostensibly the film's lead, but he's upstaged by Voight's Mr. Sir, the squinty-eyed boss of the labor gang, who manages to be menacing even when he's being reasonable. The Warden (Sigourney Weaver) is an even more hard-boiled case whom Mr. Sir has no desire to cross, but the former plays a less central role in the boys' daily routine, and the audience doesn't even see her until well into the movie when she finally emerges with a vengeance. Tim Blake Nelson plays Dr. Pendanski, the third member of the supervisory staff, who could've been eliminated from the cast entirely. I'm still not sure what essential purpose he served to the plot.
I suspect that HOLES plays better to the teenage crowd, but the storyline is intriguing enough for older audiences, especially as it's visually engaging and never deteriorates into cuteness. It's the perfect film to rent if you're looking for something a little different and on the verge of fantasy.",1074038400,,2376,4.9425

So when they introduced the movie, I was quite interested.  Part of me was hopeful it would turn out well, the other part of me was skeptical that it would be anywhere near as good as the book.  However, my fears were dashed.  This movie was FABULOUS!
The story jumps back and forth a little between three different tales -- the story of Elya Yelnats, the main character's ""no good, dirty-rotten, pig-stealing great-great-grandfather""; the story of Stanley Yelnats IV himself; and the story of a legendary outlaw, Kissing Kate Barlow.  The three stories are interwoven quite ingeniously.  In some cases, you aren't completely sure what the connection will be, but then when you find out, it fits perfectly.
The story IS slightly altered, of course, as most books-brought-to-movies tend to be.  But it very much keeps the spirit of the original book.  The boys are very believable -- I especially love Zero!  Sigourney Weaver makes a wonderfully nasty warden.  And John Voigt does a wonderful insane portrayal of Mr. Sir.

1477320,4,B00005JLYP,"People make a lot of assumptions in life. For example, it's easy for most folks to assume that a fat kid is lazy or that he is a bully, that a small kid is timid and smart. Stanley Yelnats is fat, but he's no dummy and he's no bully. He is, however, the victim of a very small bullying child nearly every day he attends school. And one day, as he is walking beneath an overpass, a pair of sneakers literally fall upon his head and cause him to be a victim of the judicial system as well. Since his father always needs another set of stinky shoes for his foot deodorizer experiments, Stanley is excited to have a prime pair to give to him. Racing off with the shoes, the police see him running and assume he is up to no good. Sure enough, the sneakers he is carrying have been reported as stolen. They are famous footwear belonging to one Clyde ""Sweet Feet"" Livingston, pro baseball player and Stanley's hero.
Truly, it's not Stanley's fault that he is sentenced to attend a juvenile delinquents hard labor camp. According to his family it's all because of his no good, dirty, rotten, pig stealing great great grandfather whose family, had he done what a gypsy woman once directed him to do, never would have been so cursed.
While at camp Stanley has to get along with some truly rough bullies, and he has to dig a 5 x 5 hole every day in the baking hot sun while avoiding poisonous lizards, snakes, spiders, and the cruel camp staff. But for all the faculty talk that digging holes builds character, there's a distinct undercurrent that something else is going on. The warden is looking for something out there in the desert, something clearly important.
And maybe, just maybe, if Stanley is the one to find it, it will be his ticket out of there.
The cinematography, setting, and casting were all terrific in this novel-turned-film. However, the characters and story understandably suffered from being cut down into feature film length. The main character is no longer fat, and indeed we do not know about his being picked on at school either.
But despite trimming out a great deal of the novel and adding in a few new pieces, it still is a terrific story and transferred very well to visual format. Our boys loved it, but reading the book first definitely helped flesh things out. I suggest you do the same.",1072051200,,2309,4.5

What really charmed me was the love story between Kissin' Kate Barlow (Patricia Arquette) and the onion picker, Sam (Dule Hill)
  This movie tells the story of a young boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf)  who is unjustly sent to Camp green Lake, a juvenile detention center where boys are made to dig a five foot hole every day out in the hot sun out on a dried up lake where it hadn't rained for a hundred and ten years, all because of a racism incident between the dead town of Green Lake's schoolteacher Katherine Barlow, the man who wished to marry her, Trout Walker and Sam the onion picker, the Negro man she loved.  Stanley must then solve the mystery of why the warden is making the boys dig holes, and what she is trying to find.  but what could possibly be buried out on a dried up lake?

There is lots of comedy, mystery, and even a little history! In the story the main character, Stanley Yelnats(Stanley is Yelnats spelled Backwards), is hit with a pair of shoes on his way home from school. The shoes belonged to Sweat Feet, a famous athlete, who had donated the shoes to the homeless shelter where he had grown up, and Stanley is blamed for steeling them.

1477437,4,B00005JLYP,"""Holes"" is supposed to be a kids' movie, but I suspect that I had a lot more fun than my six- or four-year old.  The characters in ""Holes"" are juveniles struggling to survive a murderous 18 months in a work camp in the driest spot of Texas.  Ironically named ""Green Lake"", the chunk of Texas occupied by the camp hasn't seen rain in over a century.  Instead, it's dotted by countless 5-foot deep holes dug by its juvenile denizens - so much so that, when seen from the air, it looks like the surface of the moon, or somebody with really bad acne.
Our hero is Stanley Yelnats the IVth - the last of a long line of amiable losers plagued by bad luck.  While Stanley's father (Henry Winkler - that's right, the Fonz is back!) toils on a cure for foot-odor, Stanley gets arrested for stealing a pair of celebrity sneakers.  Choosing (unwisely perhaps) Green Lake over prison, he finds himself digging holes under the blistering sun - joining an army of other enslaved youths so beaten down by the rigors of Green Lake, they almost never stop to think that they're digging for more than building character.  Unpopular at first, Stanley soon earns a place among the other diggers, and even a nickname - ""Caveman"" - which proves the surest sign of acceptance.
As Stanley's story progresses, the flick makes numerous segues into stories seemingly unconnected to the main plot - we learn of Green Lake's prettier origins, of Stanley's star-crossed forbears, of a beautiful, though murderous old-west outlaw who sealed her kills with a kiss, of stolen pigs, fortune tellers and stolen pigs.  ""Holes"", in its second half, never stops tiring you of the many ways it not only links these disparate threads but weaves them into the main story (onions and peaches?).  I think many of the plot threads flew past my kids, but luckily I was around.  If the script did more with the supporting characters, it would be priceless - instead the prisoners have little identity beyond their ""tags"" (like ""Armpit"", ""Twitch"" or ""Magnet"") or much purpose beyond educating Caveman on the camp's etiquette.  Among the adult players, Sigourney Weaver is subtly menacing as the camp's warden (who polishes her nails with rattlesnake venom) while John Voight is hysterically over the top as the chief enforcer (""Once upon a time there was a magical place where it never rained, the end"").  Special kudos for Tim Blake Nelson as ""Mr. Pendanski"", who plays a guy who actually tries to build the character of the boys - which only allows him access to their heads.  (It's incredible to see how Nelson can reconstruct himself - he was also the emotionally frozen parole officer in the little-seen ""Cherish"", and the intellectually challenged ""Delmar"" from ""Oh Brother, wherefore art thou?"")
BUT IS IT FOR THE KIDS?  I think many of the recurring plot-points will elude kids.  Instead, they might otherwise enjoy how funny it is given how violent and scary a story about youth exploitation could be.  Violence?  There are several dead-bodies, and of three deaths that actually occur during the story - two happen immediately off-camera.  Somebody gets hit in the head with a shovel, another gets scarred by venom - but the injuries look humorous while still looking like injuries.  For the squeamish, the camp abounds with scorpions, rattlers and a (fictitious) spotted lizard that touts a deadly poison.
For the doubters, there is still a good message for kids - that you should always be ready to make new friends, even if they have names like ""Squid"", ""X-Ray"" and ""Lump"".",1067817600,,3537,4.818181818181818

The wonderful screenplay is faithful to the novel and director Andrew Davis does a terrific job of bringing the story to vivid, atmospheric life. I saw the movie before I read the book (which I immediately ran out and bought), and I had no idea where the story was going from one moment to the next. I did know that I was in tremendous suspense and could not guess the outcome of the film. For some people, that's a drawback -- they feel safer when they can see everything coming and it all works out according to formula. Such viewers should avoid ""Holes"" at all costs.
Others will enjoy the action-packed story telling, the outstanding desert photography, the twisting, turning plotline, and, most of all the performances.
The acting in ""Holes"" is good enough to outshine most of the so-called ""Oscar contenders"" that always come out late in the year.

The story is about a young boy, Stanley Yelnats (what's peculiar about that name), who gets sent to boot camp. He gets put there because he is accused of a crime he didn't commit. He is then forced to dig a hole 5 feet wide and 5 feet deep for every day for a year. Soon, you realise that the digging is for a treasure, not for no reason.
The movie is well done, but very slow paced. All the colors all also the same dirt color, which takes a bit out of the movie in the long run. If you've read the book, then I suggest this movie, otherwise, read the book first.",1067212800,,743,4.095890410958904
1477443,4,B00005JLYP,"After reading/hearing many positive reviews regarding Disney's latest film ""Holes,"" I rented a copy to see for myself. Although billed as a children's film (Disney no less), ""Holes"" deals with universal elements of friendship, loyalty, and destiny, with a healthy dose of intrigue, tension and danger to boot. There are many adult elements in the film, such as a mob killing, bandits and an interracial romance in Old Texas, but the movie is easy for a younger audience to connect with as well.
Based on the popular children's book by Louis Sachar (I read several books by Mr. Sachar in elementary school), ""Holes"" is the story of Stanley Yelnats and company, boys who have been sent to Camp Green Lake, Texas to be ""rehabilitated"" after brushes with the law. The boys are forced to dig an endless number of deep holes in the desert in order to build character, but it quickly becomes evident that overseers Mr. Sir and the Warden have other plans in mind besides character building: lost treasure. Stanley befriends the D Tent boys: Zero, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, Magnet and Zigzag, and in the spirit of the Three Musketeers it's one for all and all for one as the boys struggle to make it from day to day cut off from family and society.
Stanley (Shia LaBeouf from ""Even Stevens"") and Zero/Hector (Khleo Thomas) quickly develop a bond as Zero helps him dig his holes and Stanley teaches Zero how to read. The two escape from the camp and must help each other survive in the ruthless heat and dust storms, and along the way they discover the secret of Camp Green Lake and the Kissing Bandit.
Extras were decent, including a ""gag reel"" that was mostly footage from the film  (no bloopers or anything of that nature), a  ""Dig It"" music video by the D Tent boys, several deleted scenes, two commentaries (a cast commentary geared towards a younger audience and one for the adult crowd by director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Louis Sachar-a marvelous idea for kids' DVDs), ""On the Set with Louis Sachar"" and a making-of featurette.
There are several moments of violence (fights, several deaths and near-death experiences, gunplay), implied romance, and no overly offensive language (""Holes"" is rated PG).
Overall this is a great movie, full of friendship, scheming, overcoming challenges, bandits and buried treasure, along with poisonous lizards, onions, and shoe odour!",1067212800,,2367,4.9002493765586035

Come to find out these shoes belonged to a famous athlete who'd donated them to a children's shelter to help raise money.  So when Charlie is caught with them, he's dispatched to Camp Greenlake --- a juvenile detention facility designed to help him ""build character.""
Flash back to the early 1900's and we find a totally different Greenlake town.  In contrast to the Camp Greenlake that Stanley is sent to in the future where it is all desert, this area was a paradise.  Until a white woman kisses a black man.  A town mob kills the black man and turns the woman he kissed (the town's school teacher) into Kissing Kate Barlow, a notorious outlaw who robs nearly every form of commerce coming into Greenlake. The town soon withers and dies.
Stanley arrives at Camp Greenlake to find a multitude of delinquents digging holes all around the dried up lake bed.  No one is sure of what they're looking for.  Stanley soon becomes Caveman, a nickname his band of hole diggers give him.  Stanley befriends a little boy named Zero.  And Zero has a past that will intersect with Stanley's in an amazing way.
I don't want to spoil the enjoyment of this film, but be prepared for all of the connections that are made.  Everything
--- and I do mean everything --- is related to everything else in this movie: Lizards, Onions, Kissing Kate Barlow, Zero, Stanley's Dad's stinky shoe project, Camp Greenlake's Warden, Mr. Sir (played excellently by Jon Voight), a curse on the Yelnats family, Madame Zeroni, the boat the black man is killed in, the treasure of Kate Barlow!  Everything is woven together to form a fantastic spectacle for movie-goers!  It's really a film for all ages.

Smith and Max Kasch -- get their own DVD commentary track, delivering a raucous rap session that captures the rebellious spirit of ""Holes,"" and then some.
Disney has something here. No big-brother director or producer keeping the commentary boringly on topic. Just kids telling it like is for the benefit of a (presumably) young audience. It's fart jokes, raging teen hormones and a lexicon of sick slang. Along the way, squeeze in some great stories about the production. Brilliant.
Director Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"") and ""Holes"" author-screenwriter Louis Sachar tell their side of the story on a second commentary for those north of 18.
Video and audio (your basic Dolby Digital) are up to major studio standards. The disc begins with ads that can be avoided by skipping a few chapters.
Extras include two decent making-of featurettes, shot for the DVD. A high-energy music video features the boys singing the film's opening work song, which they wrote with producer Doug E. Fresh. A handful of pretty strong deleted scenes unspool without explanation of why they were cut.
Davis, who's quite good at commentaries, aims his talk at a film-savvy audience, spending a lot of time on how CGI helped him achieve the varied naturalistic looks on a tight budget. Stock footage intercut with shots of the cast helped hold down costs on the wild-west scenes.
 Davis and Sachar discuss the challenge of the making a gritty, sometimes violent film for a PG audience. The movie had to be ""not too scary for young kids and tough enough for older kids."" (Parents might want to prescreen this one for kids under 7. This is not really a Disney film, but more of an independent film backed by Disney.)

1477580,5,B00005JLYP,"""Holes"" is a highly entertaining movie for all ages.  It contains comedy, western, and action.  Such combination gives this movie the unique and creative theme.  Some surprises occur, which give it many unexpected twists and turns.  Oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver and Oscar winner Jon Voight wonderfully perform their roles with humor and with sass.  The duo give ""Holes"" the western feel that it needs, being the setting and its history.  The kids' roles were improvised wonderfully by the producers and the director, whom also filmed the movie wonderfully.
Stanley Yelnats possesses a terrible family curse that his great-great grandfather spreaded: the bloodline will always have bad luck.  Stanley's bad luck starts with his criminal accusation of stealing a pair of legendary shoes, which he's innocent.  The judge sentences him to 18 months in a juvenile facility.  The warden and Mr. Sir force the kids and him to dig one hole a day.  However, the kids know little about the land's history, which will lead them to a surprising and hilarious conclusion.

1477581,5,B00005JLYP,"It seems that as of late Disney has rebounded from making mediocre tripe like it did during the late nineties. This film along with Finding Nemo represent a new generation of family films: movies with little objectionable content that are genuinely entertaining and also quite witty, too. Holes is perhaps the most clever film I've ever seen, maybe too clever. It is based on a book of the same name that I have never read, so I will only judge the film. However, it is outstanding, funny, absurdist, along with plenty of other labels. For pure fun for the entire family, or just for yourself, you would be hard-pressed to do better.
First, the film's merits. The movie is a very ambitious (primarily) children's film, interweaving comedy, drama (contemporary and historical), prison films, absurdist theater, etc. As a result we get a remarkable synthesis. Holes is a movie about a dozen things that all revolve around Stanley (played by Shia LaBeouf) and how he always manages to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. After being convicted for a crime he did not commit, he is sent to a prison camp where he gets to dig, you guessed it, holes. As a result of a complex series of actions, past and present, he manages to lift an ancient family curse and exculpate himself, all the while being charming on-screen and packing his voice-over narration with all kinds of information about his family's past. The sheer volume of story threads in the film is mind-boggling, and they form a very complex tapestry.
This leads to my (minor) problems with the film. Essentially, the movie is too clever. The subplot about Henry Winkler trying to find the cure for foot odor is extraneous, and it is the only part of the story that is painfully connected to the story via some symbolism (I don't want to spoil it). The CGI lizards were also a bit less than convincing, but these are minor points. Ultimately, the film is only nominally weighed down by these small aberrations. As a whole, the work is well-done.
In brief, this is a film that will entertain an entire family without insulting anyone's intelligence. Highly recommended.",1065830400,,2127,4.751351351351351
1477582,5,B00005JLYP,"If you didn't read the book, this movie is about the strangest thing.  Stanley (the protagonist) is sent to a youth camp where to build character the inmates have to dig a round 5 ft by ft deep hole every day of their incarceration.  Stanley thinks he is there because of an old family curse involving his pig stealing great great grandfather who forgot to pay off the fortuneteller Madame Zeroni for her advice before coming to America.  Soon a plot develops where Stanley (Shia LeBeouf) befriends the great great great great grandson of Madame Zeroni (Khleo Thomas), and together they discover the secret that the Warden (played by Sigourney Weaver) wants the boys to find.  Stanley breaks the curse, and without giving away the ending, the Warden and Mr. Sir (the overseer played by Jon Voight) get their just desserts.
The desert scenery is dreary and hot.  And the flashbacks to the times before are done nicely, with a subplot complete with bandits, a onion-picker, and a schoolteacher turned killer.  It's hard to follow the moving between the plot and subplot so it's best to see the movie a second time.  Then read the book.  Very delightful feel-good story with a happy ending.",1065744000,,1187,4.784313725490196

So bad that it became the focus of the movie, at least for me.
The story, though extremely far-fetched is good, and has a moral.  Although I didn't realize pounding someone's behind was considered moral.  Well, now I know.
Sigourney Weaver was definitely over the top, but very entertaining as usual.
And before I forget, the kid with the super thick glasses, he was a bully that bullied everyone around the whole entire movie until at one point he decided he didn't want to bully the hero of the film around anymore, so now he's good?
Oh, okay.  I see.
I imagine this was a good children's book, and could've been a good movie, if the CGI (did I mention this) wasn't horrendous and unnecessary, and violence weren't portrayed as a favorable attribute, and the lighting and camerawork didn't look like it were done by people that had never seen a movie or television.",1065744000,,1140,4.40952380952381

  This movie has a fantastic cast as well. Let me start off with my favortie cast memeber. Sigourney Weaver is AWESOME as the mean spirted warden. She lights up the screen and you find yourself begging for more Sigourney. Shia LaBeouf is great at Stanley Yelnats and brings humor and heart to the screen. Patricia Arquette is great as Kissin Kate Barlow and totally embodies her perfectly. The rest of the cast I will mention in the following review.
  When a famous pair of sneakers falls from the sky and lands in Stanleys hands, he finds himself in court with the decision of jail or Camp Green Lake. His family (except his mom) quickly blame this on Stanleys dirty rotten pig stealing greatgrandfather. Well, hes never been to camp so thats better than jail. He is sentenced to 18 months at Camp Green Lake to build character. Once there, he realizes he is not in any normal camp. He also finds out that there is no lake, and the place is not green. He is in the middle of the desert, and Camp Green Lake has the only water source for 100 miles. It doesnt take long, before MR.SIR (Jon Voight, who perfectly acts out this odd character) takes Stanley's bags and gives him his work clothes and his relaxation clothes and explains to him that every morning he will be required to dig one hole 5 feet deep and 5 feet wide to turn around his bad character.
  The movie continues to explain how something fishy is going on at Camp Green Lake, and explains Stanley's greatgrandfathers curse, and the life of Kissin Kate.

1477587,4,B00005JLYP,"Like a gentle breeze at the end of a hot day, this is the feeling I got after watching Holes, refreshing and sweet.
Don't let the Disney name put you off, because it is one of the very few films they have made in recent years that is not overtly commercial and sentimental.
I have to admit though, that this review comes from a person who has never read the book, and had very little idea about it, so it is strictly based on the film itself. But I would assume that getting the author Louis Sachar to script his own bestselling work  was a very wise choice, as the likelihood of remaining faithful to the book is great.(Adapting bestselling books to the screen has always been an ambitious endeavour and a hit and miss affair).
But it needs much more in order for the film to work, the right combination of writer,director and actors,a collaborative effort and talent from all.
And surely I did find this in Holes.
Andrew Davis has succeeded in maintaining a good balance between the visual and the drama, and managed to direct a sensitive touching and warm film, one of his best to date (his speciality has always been the action/thriller genres-Collateral Damage, Fugitive, Perfect Murder,The Package- and this is his first drama).
All the cast are great, from Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Patricia Arquette, Henry Winkler and the director's dad Nat Davis, to of course all the kids,who were superb, especially Even Stevens's Shia LaBeouf: a very promising actor, at home equally with drama and comedy, and I hope we will see much more of him in the future.
There are a couple of observations I made about Holes,
I could not help draw comparison between Jon Voight's character and performance and Slim Pickens portrayal of Deputy Taggart in Blazzing Saddles, but this does not take away the fact that Voight was wonderful as always. In addition,I did find few elements of The Mexican (The Curse) and The Mighty (Fantasy and Friendships)in the film.
While Holes might not be an all time classic, it is still a heartwarming and moving film that will please on many levels. One thing you will be sure of, the holes in Holes are certainly not empty.",1065225600,,2149,4.670184696569921

It is truly amazing (and disgusting) that ANYONE would find this book even mildly amusing, let alone the entire population of children ages 8-16 in the US. I'm still not sure why I decided to go see this movie at all. Last year in school (that was 7th grade for me...I'm 13), my English teacher has us read this...book. At first I thought ""Hey, this'll be cool, since so many people liked it!"" Boy, was I wrong. ""Holes"" is a good title for it, as there are major 'holes' in the plot. A kid named Stanley Yelnats (that name was what first tipped me off that book blows) gets sent to a detention center because he stole some famous dudes sneakers. There, he must dig holes. Wow. Impressive. This pathetic excuse for a plot keeps being interrupted by flashbacks to 100 years before, with some bozo bank robber. Gee-whiz. In the movie, the acting is stilted, the dialog sucks, basically, it was really not worth being made. At all. Please, if you want a good movie, forget this piece of crap, go rent a Lord of the Rings movie, or go see Pirates of the Caribbean.

I read the book on the advice of a friend who knew I was interested in children's books. I was blown away. Then I heard Disney was making a movie -- I was apprehensive about the story getting Hollywoodized, but when I saw the finished product, I realized my fears were unfounded.
It didn't hurt at all that they got Louis Sachar, the author of the novel, to write the screenplay, but the casting of this movie was wonderful as well, with the kids turning in strong performances all around and the adults clearly relishing their roles, particularly the scene-chewing Jon Voight.
This is a pretty good DVD as well, especially by Disney standards, with a comentary and some nice behind-the-scenes features.

1478099,5,B00005JLYP,"Disney has tried so very hard to become contemporary, and perhaps for the youngest family members they have become so.  Disney has succeeded less well for teenagers and for adults, and most especially for boys.  ""Holes"" marks a very different movie for Disney, containing aspects of traditional Disney movies while being more relevant and current without being cheesy.
Our hero is Stanley Yelnats IV, wrongly accused of stealing a valuable pair of tennis shoes.  Stanley is quickly zipped through the justice system and sent to a ""camp"" for boys rather than jail or prison.  However, our story is told in bits and pieces in a fashion that requires the viewer to pay attention carefully to the movie.  The story begins with Stanley Yelnats arriving at Camp Greenlake, which is neither green nor has a lake.  In flashbacks throughout the movie we capture pieces of how Stanley ended up in Camp Greenlake.
Overlaid with Stanley's flashbacks is a second story regarding the original Stanley Yelnats and how he came to be cursed by Madame Zeroni (played by the always awesome Eartha Kitt, whom some might remember as one of those who played Catwoman in the campy 60s Batman TV series).
Another flashback is presented throughout the movie describing Sam the onion man and his relationship with Kissin' Kate Barlow, which relates to the history of not-so-green Greenlake.
The central feature of the movie is the endless holes the boys must dig; one per day per boy, five feet deep and five feet in diameter.  Any boy that finds something ""interesting,"" which is defined about a third of the way into the movie, gets to have the day off.  Our hero Stanley is the one who finds something interesting, and ultimately leads the way to the fun and tidy ending.
With the four sets of stories the potential for confusion was high, but the direction and production were so well done that other than needing to pay attention, I was able to keep the story clear all the way to the conclusion where everything was nicely tied together.
There are so many well-known actors in this movie that it would take pages to list their principal achievements and how well they did in this movie.  At the risk of missing someone's favorites, Sigourney Weaver plays the warden of Camp Greenlake, Jon Voight is the head of security, Henry Winkler is Stanley's father, and Patricia Arquette is Kissin' Kate Barlow.  The veteran talents in this movie were well-chosen and perform perfectly.  The newcomers in the roles of the boys were amazing, and I believe that several of them will likely appear in future movies.
Given that this was a Disney movie, Disney walked a fine line between keeping to traditional Disney values and yet making a contemporary movie.  Thus there was constant temptation to add more violence, or more threatening situations.  Director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Louis Sachar did an excellent job of keeping the currency of the subject matter to the point where you felt as though the characters could really have existed, and yet kept this movie accessible to all but the youngest members of the family, a very difficult task.
This DVD contains an array of extras that, as with most extras, range from excellent to ""why did they bother.""  The best extras (I thought) were the making of the movie and ""On the set with Louis Sachar.""  The ""Dig It"" music video was okay, but way too short.  The six deleted scenes contained some unnecessary scenes and some scenes really too violent to fit with the final cut, and I found them to of little interest.  The commentary by the director and screenwriter were interesting, but unless you really want to know how the movie was made, you can skip the commentaries.  The gag reel was weak.
I believe boys will most especially like this movie.  Girls may find some of the movie disgusting (the boys often behave as you might think boys typically behave), but the romance between Kissin' Kate and Sam may intrigue them, as well as the strength of her character.  While the focus of this movie is the boys, there is an interesting balance between male and female characters.  The warden and Kissin' Kate are very strong roles, balanced principally by Sam and Stanley, and by the bumbling of Mr. Sir (Voight) and the supposed therapist Dr. Pedanski (Tim Blake Nelson).  I strongly recommend this movie for those families, particularly with children 8 and above.",1064707200,,4390,4.825333333333333

The deleted scenes are mostly those that were too violent to make the final cut.  For example, at least four of the scenes feature Shia Lebouf getting seriously beaten up.  First by the cops, then by bullies, the by Mr. Sir, then by Squid.
Also, the gag reel wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.  Instead of the usual hilarious bloopers other dvd's put in their gag reels, this dvd features mostly stuff from the film.  No mistakes, no 'gags.'  This was my biggest disapointment.  Also the commentary by the director and the author, Louis Sachar, one of my favorite authors, quickly became boring then tedious.
On the other hand, the commentary by the boys is hilarious.  Especially whenever they find out the shot they spent two days on was cut.  Poor Jake, who played squid, was soooo disappointed when his only stunt fall was cut.  Filled with tons of impromptu singing and the boys sighing over everything female in the film (Patricia, give Max a kiss when you see him), it is one of the best commentaries I've ever heard.
With all these complaints, why four stars?  Cause the movie is excellent and the boy's commentaries and interviews make up for anything that might have been missing.",1064534400,,1386,4.612244897959184

THIS is the kind of family entertainment I wish I'd had as a child. It doesn't talk down to children with cardboard characters, and consequently neither children nor parents are bored by it. Every piece of the story fits well: there is no filler, and the screenplay has a constant forward momentum, thanks to the mystery of the various narrative lines which weave together.  It's more complex than most children's movies, which may help explain its popularity. (A teacher I know tells me that some teachers use the book Holes as a carrot for the children to behave: we won't read from Holes today unless everyone behaves, and it works.)

the story is involved enough to let us guess the routes karma will take while laughing at the improbability of the whole thing. so its a kid's movie with a point, not badly done, you cheer with the audience at all the right times and hiss the villain.

The story is very clever and funny, although some aspects might be a little dark for younger kids. Younger kids might also be challenged by the intertwined plot lines, but everyone should be pleased by how the different stories finally come together.
The actors are all very good. The kids are comfortably relaxed and low-key, the adults delightfully exaggerated.
The soundtrack is also very good. ""Dig It"" over the final credits was worth staying in the theater for, and the songs for the star-crossed lovers play up the emotion which is nicely underplayed by the actors.",1057622400,,854,4.896551724137931

I've seen several people comment on the fact that Stanley's not chubby in the movie, and the reason for that is that it isnt't a key detail. I recall reading an article in the Austin American Statesman (Louis Sachar is from Austin) regarding the movie, and he said they picked Shia because he was the best actor. Shia actually said that he was trying to bulk up for the part (a funny mental image!), but Sachar told him that it wasn't important. Sachar said that the Stanley was chubby so he could carry Zero up the mountian.

Stanly, Shia's character, is a fan of the person who signed the sneakers but for the robbery becomes ""no fan of"" the celebrity. The judge sentences Stanly to a choice of jail or a stay at Camp Greenlake to improove his ways. Obviously camp is a gimmie so he ends up digging 5 foot holes per day in a desert infested with rattle snakes and lethal yellow lizards. During the movie you get flash backs piece by piece of how the family curse came about and about the link to a treasure (The reason The Warden wants all those holes). The curse is a beyond awkward tale of one of Stanly's ancestors falling in love with a girl, but the girl couldn't decide over the young, handsome man that she loved or the arranged marrige to a bloated, sloppy man that she didn't love, so he was outraged and broke a promise of his to a fortune teller. The story of the treasure is about a cowgirl who taught an adult reading class (all men) in which all of her students wanted to go out with her. She rejected one of them who eventually caught her making out with a black onion seller [there was racism at the time period] and got the onion seller shot.

He has a choice of going to jail or to a camp, and he chooses the latter, not knowing what kind of a place it is.

1478319,5,B00005JLYP,"""Holes"" is one of those rare films that is faithful to the original book. Of course it helps that Newbery Award winning author, Louis Sachar, also wrote the screenplay.
I'm a former elementary school librarian who really enjoyed the book when it came out. I saw the film with my son, who has read the book several times, and my wife (a teacher) who had never read this book. My son and I went on an on about how Camp Greenlake is just like we pictured it in our heads, and my wife kept asking us if this or that was in the book, and we just kept saying, ""Yes!""
Actually, I think the film made me appreciate the subtle complexity of the book even more. We're talking about a book that deals with such sophisticated themes as fate, justice, compassion, racial tolerance, love, education, family identity, keeping promises, and friendship, to name a few.
Don't let the PG rating fool you. This is not just a kid's movie. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't take younger children to see it, simply because they wouldn't get it.
Who would've thought that a film (and a book) about a bunch of kids digging holes could be so interesting! Highly recommended. I'm sure we'll see it again.",1053820800,,1175,4.444444444444445

1478322,5,B00005JLYP,"Popular children's author Louis Sachar converts his most intricate book into a screenplay, and director Andrew Davis, in collaboration, brings it gloriously to the big screen!  Although I'm surrounded by a sea of terrific young 11 and 12 year old reviewers, ""Holes"" is for everyone!
A young cast of actors, all talented, couples with Jon Voight as the over-the-top Camp Greenlake superintendent, ""Mr. Sir"".
Greenlake is a juvenile detention camp in the desert, and while conditions there are pretty oppressive, they are downplayed enough to make the movie safe for 9 and 10 year old viewers, as well.
The charm of the book, and also the movie, is to tell the tale of the Yelnats clan, revolving it around young Stanley Yelnats IV's incarceration for something he didn't do.  Flashback is used to revisit the era that both Stanley's great-grandfather and grandfather lived in.  These flashback scenes, amazingly, focus not on the Yelnats, but more on the women who inflicted the family curse on them, arising in terrific roles for Eartha Kitt (as gypsy Madam Zeroni) and stagecoach robber Kissin' Kate
Barlow (played by the luminous and talented Patricia Arquette).
Modern day is not without its own bad girl, with Sigourney Weaver as the Warden, who rules the camp with an iron fist.  The Warden has her own agenda for the holes that the boys are forced to dig in the desert, and she's quirky, evil, and larger than life, looming over Voight and ""Dr.""(Tim Blake Nelson).  Weaver's ""Ex-c-uuuuuu-se Me?"" line, used over and over in the film, is terrifying!
The audience is caught up in the action from the opening screen, and given a couple of young anti-heroes that are worth their weight in gold.  A cameo by the irresistible Dule Hill from ""The West Wing"", is also notable.
""Holes"" is perhaps the best family film of the last couple of years, and an outstanding example of what good filmmaking is all about!
Highly recommended for sheer enjoyment!",1053734400,,1948,4.905775075987842
1478323,5,B00005JLYP,"I see a lot of kids movies with my 6 year old boy and 8 year old girl. I actually like kids movies a lot (although I couldn't bring myself to take them to Piglet's Great Adventure), but I absolutely loved this movie...probably more than my kids (especially the 6 year old)because they're a bit young to catch many of the subtle and not so subtle connections in the movie.
I have not read the book, but this movie was intriguing enough that I bought the book and plan on reading it soon. Usually I hate movie renditions of books (Harry Potter being an exception) when I have read the book first, so I prefer to see the movies first (Harry Potter being an exception.) In this case, I want to know more about the 3 plots the movie follows: Stanley's plight, the story of his ancestor, and the tragic love story of Kate and Sam. This love story has a brutal ending, and although very little is actually seen in the movie (no blood, guts, etc.) it is very clear what has happened and very disturbing. However, it's a part of our country's history (present?) that we cannot deny and that we need to be reminded of - a very real and ugly sort of disturbing (rather than the disturbing of slash and gash, blood and guts Hollywood.) In any case, the 3 plots are completely intertwined and become almost one by the satisfying, feel good ending.
There's also an element of magic and the inexplicable which I loved. Many people have been put off by the yellow lizards, but I think they stand for more than just fictional reptiles and they add both a comic and menacing element. And surprise at the end where the yellow lizards are in the hole with Stanley and Zero - can't say any more for those who haven't seen the movie.
The movie escapes being too dark by the comedic moments throughout. I'm not sure how I feel about Henry Winkler as Stanley's dad, but the other actors seemed to fit their parts quite well. I understand Stanley is actually fat in the book, so that will be hard to reconcile with the movie version.
In all, I thoroughly enjoyed this quirky, comedic, off-the-wall, tragic, mesmerizing movie with its stories of retribution and redemption and I highly recommend it. I will say, I think my son (aged 6) may have been a bit frightened at parts. Although the violence is not graphic (much less graphic than many cartoons), it is very real. And I'm not sure he was able to put together all the complexities of the plot, although he frequently surprises me in this regard.

The woman then becomes the kissing bandit, who travels around killing men and kissing them on the head.  There are guns and shooting and killing and racial issues in this movie that many parents may find inappropriate for young viewers.  My son, who just turned 6, was very upset by that storyline.

A little voice in the back of my head told me that this movie might be like Disney's other live action films(which were mostly comedies), but after I saw this at the theaters, I was pleasantly suprised. The movie occasionally shifts between the past and the present of Camp Greenlake, which means that you probably shouldn't take a bathroom break during the movie, or you'll miss a 'hole' lot(lol... pun intended). The acting is pretty good, especially Sigourney Weaver as the Warden. The story behind the curse of Camp Greenlake is actually pretty sweet and a bit creepy at the same time. Holes is a bit more violent than your average live-action Disney flick, but then again I'm sure most will say the same once Pirates of the Carribean comes out.
Anyway, the part of the movie that really touched me was when Stanley offered to help Zero learn how to read. Sure, Holes has its comedic moments, but there's not as much as you'd expect. Plus, the movie is suprisingly very emotional. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the Deadly Yellow Spotted Lizards, which were pretty fake looking, but thats just a minor gripe. You should see this movie if you like a good story, and you don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film either.

I'll spare a synopsis of the film as you can easily get that from any of the numerous other reviews. I'll just add that Holes is a very creative story about things coming full circle and everything eventually setting itself right.
There were some problems I had with the film however. I was a bit disappointed how obvious every twist and turn of the plot was. Don't get me wrong, the plot is great and the twists and turns are perfect, but would be a lot more powerful if you didn't see them coming from a mile away. It strongly gives the impression that this was done for a younger audience that might not understand the complexities of the plot. As such, the film seems rather simple and childish at points.
For the most part, the casting and the acting in the film is pretty good. While none of the kids are the next Hally Joel Osmet, they aren't bad. Two of the antagonists of the film played by Sigourney Weaver and Jon Voight are spot on with just the right amount of ""camp"" and ""cliche"" to their characters. I coulda done without the main characters bumbling family but that's Disney for you, and kids should like it.

The imagery, settings, flashbacks, the narrative...everything about this movie is outright captivating. Although the story is a little ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (based on an eponymous book, which I confess I haven't read)  the themes of loyalty, greed, interracial love, murder, revenge, suicide, inheritance -- and their treatment are all compelling. Even the credits are nice, with a song performed by the cast themselves so you may want to stick around until the end.
Tough to find holes in Holes, only piddling caveats could be with a couple of slightly scary scenes and some cuss-words. Depending on the country you come from, you may want to consider this if you take kids younger than 10 or so with you.

Then we flash back and forth to an Old West frontier town, where the white school marm is in love with the black onion-farmer. Then it's back to Camp Green Lake. We are never told, until the end, what all the flashbacks and  characters have to do with anything and after a while, it's hard to keep it all straight.

Shia Leboeuf is quite appealing as the innocent and kindhearted Stanley.  The teens who play Stanley's campmates are all good, especially the boy who plays ""Zero,"" the hero of yet another subplot.  Fans of the novel will undoubtedly enjoy ""Holes,"" since the screenplay was written by the author.",1051747200,,1411,4.605577689243028
1478511,5,B00005JLYP,"Someone probably had a good chuckle when they added the theme song to ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" to the soundtrack of this movie, because in many respects, this is a teenage version of the Coen Brothers' movie. Here, the jailed kids are mostly in jail instead of on the lam, but the tension between inmates is wonderfuly maintained just as it was in the Coen movie, with friends and enemies mixed together with the to-be-expected animosity towards the jailers. The use of flashbacks is probably the best I've seen in a movie, and it makes the humor of the present and the irony of the intertwined past twice as strong.  I highly recommend this movie, and NOW I've got to read the book!

1478512,4,B00005JLYP,"""Holes"" is one of the best movie adaptions of a novel I have seen in a long time. This is probably because the novel's author, Louis Sachar, was included in the screenwriting process. Somehow the film manages to include all the complexities of the novel, including several flashbacks to past events that bear on the matter at hand. ""Holes"" tells the unusual story of a boy who is wrongly accused of stealing some sneakers and is sent to a prison camp in the middle of nowhere. Each day he must dig a hole in the desert, while trying to fit in with the other misfits at the camp. But there's much more to it than that - what is the real purpose of all this digging? What happened in this place long ago? And how can the boy overcome his family's curse? The many strands of this ingenious story are skillfully woven together, and the film's casting is excellent. The boy actors (mostly unknowns) do a great job, and the adult actors are superb, especially Jon Voight as the odious ""Mr. Sir."" (One problem I had with the novel is that the counselor Mr. Pendanski seemed like too nice a guy throughout most of the book; here he is obnoxious from the start, which actually improves the story.) A fine movie for older kids.",1051488000,,1217,4.4375
1478513,5,B00005JLYP,"I was rather surprised that author Louis Sachar did the screenplay for this movie version of his novel ""Holes,"" because I was quite prepared to blame the shortcomings on this film with whoever had the job of adapting it for the big screen.  The novel deserves its reputation amongst young readers because of the marvelous way it brings literally everything together in the climax.  The film version tries to do the same thing and if the result is not as magical as I would hope a Disney film to be, it could well be because I already know the punch line for this story.
Our young hero in ""Holes"" is the palindromically christened Stanley Yelnats the Fourth.  Walking along one day a pair of expensive athletic shoes come out of a relatively clear blue sky and hit him in the head.  The next thing Stanley knows he is on his way to Camp Green Lake, a facility for juvenile delinquents where the idea is that if you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot desert sun, then you will turn him into a good boy (think ""Cool Hand Luke"" for young teens but set on Arrakis a.k.a. Dune the desert planet).  However, there is much more to the story of ""Holes"" than that.  In fact, there is much more to virtually everything in ""Holes,"" so pay attention and remember details because they will become important later on.
At various points in the story as we learn about a couple of other stories.  One is the origin of the family curse that is on the Yelnats family because of the actions of our Stanley's great-great-grandfather (father of Stanley Yelnats the first).  The other story is set a century earlier in what was then still the Old West and explains how Green Lake because a dust bowl (and involves the aforementioned Stanley Yelnats the first).  Meanwhile, Stanley and the other boys continue to dig a hole each day in the hot sun, although they have been promised the day off if they find something ""interesting.""
As I indicated on top, the less you know about the story the more you will enjoy the film.  I had forgotten enough to get caught up in weaving together of the developing narrative threads.  Shia LaBeouf plays the present day Stanley and seems a normal kid caught up in extraordinary events.  His friendship with Zero (Khleo Thomas), the silent kid in the group bears unexpected fruit.  The kids do not have much of an opportunity to shine because the adults tend to upstage them at every opportunity.  Jon Voight chews what little scenery is available in the desert as Mister Sir, Tim Blake Nelson steals scenes as the camp's therapist, Dr. Pendanksi, with his comic pratfalls, while Sigourney Weaver turns on the ice as the camp's Warden.
Director Andrew Davis (""Collateral Damage,"" which, oddly enough, we watched last night), distances the viewer from both the violence and the oppressive conditions of the work camp.  I think this is both calculated and appropriate.  I have no trouble mixing the realistic horrors of a sadistic boot camp like this with the fairy tale elements of the story.  But then I remember the original version of Cinderella so a grim fairy tale is not going to bother me.  But for kids raised on Disney films and the world of Harry Potter, the tone of this film is on target.  I do not think that ""Holes"" is a great film; certainly not as great as the book.  But it is a very solid film, without any major areas where things are missing.",1051315200,,3398,4.539344262295082
1478514,5,B00005JLYP,"""Holes"" is an amazing tale of a young boy named Stanley Yelnats.  He is wrongly accused of stealing a pair of shoes from a charity center, and is forced to attend a youth correctional facility.  Here, he makes new friends, such as Armpit, X-ray, and Zero.  He also meets Mr. Sir and the Warden.  Each person held at the facility is required to dig holes every day - 5 feet deep, 5 feet in diameter.  As Stanley, later called ""Caveman,"" is digging one day, he discovers a small lipstick tube with the initials ""KB"" on it.  They could only be from the old west murderer Kissin' Kate Barlow.  The Warden is ecstatic and commands them to dig more in the area to see if they can find anything else.  Now Stanley and his friends are faced with a mystery.  Why are they digging holes?  Is it for more than just building character?",1051315200,,823,4.355263157894737
1478515,4,B00005JLYP,"Wow I have read the book and I liked it but when I saw the movie I was like dude this is cool and good acting.  I was thinking I would like the book better but that changed fast!
Adapted by Louis Sacher from his Newbery award-winning book, this is the story of Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf), whose name is the same backwards and forwards, a palindrome. Stanley is wrongfully accused of stealing a very valuable pair of sneakers and sentenced to a juvenile facility in the desert. Each boy there is required to dig a five-foot-deep hole every day. They are told it is to help them develop character, but could it be that the Warden (Sigourney Weaver) is looking for something that just might be buried in the endless stretch of sand that once was Green Lake?
We cannot understand the answer to that question until we learn the stories of Stanley's pig-stealing great-great grandfather, who was cursed by a gypsy, and of the notorious outlaw of the Old West, Kissin' Kate Barlow, who left lipstick kissprints on the faces of the men she killed.",1051142400,,1043,4.577540106951871

Stanley chooses Green Lake because he's ""never been to camp before"".  Camp Green Lake is a disciplinary camp, not your typical summer camp, for youths where its ""campers"" are required to dig a 5' x 5' hole daily in the hot desert sun, by order of the mysterious Warden (Sigourney Weaver) and her assistants Mr. Sir (Jon Voight) and Mr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson).
Stanley and his fellow campers think digging holes is punishment without a purpose, but it soon becomes clear that the Warden is searching for something beneath the mysterious sands in a desert with more history than the audience realizes.
""Holes"" is wonderful family entertainment with an all-star cast of Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Patricia Arquette, Rick Fox, Tim Allen, etc.  Based on the children's book by Lois Sachar, the film boasts a terrific screenplay full of wit, humor, mystery, drama, tears, and suspense; there's something for everyone.  The story is truly remarkable, especially for that of a children's film.  The kids will love ""Holes"" for its humor and fun.

However, the story jumps back and forth between the current time and a past time (which are inter-related).  There isn't a lot of the action, special effects, or slap-stick humor that very young kids like; but, my nine-year old was indeed able to follow the story and told me she did like the movie (but, not enough to buy on DVD when it is released).  The music was good (she may buy the soundtrack).  As an adult I thought the movie was very well done and had a little mystery to it (I won't repeat the movie summary as shown above).

Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LaBouf), is a hard-luck boy, not surprising seeing his great-great grandpa had a curse laid on him for eternity by Madam Zeroni (Eartha Kitt).  The Yelnats have had a habit of failure ever since.  Stanley's Dad, (Henry Winkler) is working (unsuccessfully, of course) on inventing a perfect shoe-deodorizer.  Ironically, Stanley is falsely arrested for stealing a great athlete's shoes.  He is given a choice of jail or Camp Green Lake.  Stanley innocently notes he's never been to camp before so---you just know This Was Not A Good Choice.  Camp Green Lake is on a parched and barren desert.  The lake disappeared a century before.  Stanley is indoctrinated by down-and-dirty bad Mr. Sir (Jon Voight) who informs Stanley his days will be spent digging 5' x 5' holes to build ""character"" and any misstep will bring him to the Warden's (Sigourney Weaver) attention, a lady who coats her nails with rattlesnake venom.
His fellow inmates who like to be known as X-Ray, Armpit, ZigZag and Magnet greet Stanley with hazing and hard times.  His only true ally is tiny little Zero (Khleo Castro) who wants Stanley to teach him to read.  The day-in-day-out work is filthy, backbreaking and endless.  But Stanley is learning some secrets that might permit him to break the age-old curse of the Yelnats.
Mr. Davis tells us Stanley and Camp Green Lake's history via flashbacks, and for the most part does a good job keeping the story moving, though it might be overly complex for younger viewers.  Jon Voight is priceless as thoroughly bad, gimlet-eyed, bone stupid Mr. Sir.  Sigourney Weaver is just shy of psychotic with her barely repressed rage at her situation.  The boys are rightly terrified of her.  ""Holes"" has a magnificent arc of a story and culminates in a manner that will have the audience cheering.
There are a few scary scenes that might be too much for the viewer under nine, as well as the flashbacks that could be hard to understand. If you have doubts about suitability, read the book both to yourself and the child.  That way you have a win/win situation.  This is a don't miss movie.

HOLES is a wonderful movie even though it flips back and forth between three different periods in time; deals with literacy, racism, and other big issues; and takes place in a juevenile prison camp in a desert in Texas. Those who like the book are almost sure to enjoy the movie. However, those who have never read the book will probably enjoy the movie as well. The film is hard to describe because it is such a hybrid of so many different things. It is both a chain-gang film (like COOL HAND LUKE) and a buddy picture, with elements of a Western thrown in.

The wonderfully twisty magical realism of the book survived the transition to the big screen (author Louis Sachar did the screenplay); the acting by the child actors was subtle and effective; the adult actors filled their roles with gusto; and the gospel/spiritual/country-ish soundtrack was both fitting for the story and its themes and a treat to listen to on its own.

The screenplay is written by the novel's author, Louis Sachar, which must have helped the fidelity to the original story significantly.
Jon Voight, Sigourney Weaver and everyone else are just terrific in their parts. The basic story is about a young boy, Stanley, whose family has perpetual bad luck due to a curse put on them for an ancestor's broken promise.  Stanley is mistakenly charged and convicted of stealing a sport celebrity's shoes and is sent to a penal camp for boys.
The camp, named after a dried up lake, is in the middle of a desert and all the boys must dig a 5'X 5' hole each day to ""build character"" and to find a secret special something for The Warden, Sigourney Weaver.
How the boys form alliances, survive the dehumanizing conditions of the camp and try to resolve the century old curse results in a surprisingly ""feel good"" movie. It's not too often that the audience in the theater cheers out loud but they were for this film. Everything in it fit together perfectly to make the whole story thoroughly enjoyable.

Sounds like another 'Best Picture of 2003' caliber-type movie."" Instead, what I viewed was an absolutely disastrous motion picture, with what has to be the most ridiculous storyline in motion picture history. Anytime you pair together a group of troublesome teenagers with a mulligan of adult ex-cons, the recipe usually spells out major disaster. ""Holes"" is no exception. Generally, when one thinks of Walt Disney Entertainment, that person can usually count on wholesome, family-oriented entertainment, although this company has put out its fair share of subpar projects throughout its long and storied history, with ""Holes"" scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel, especially in the ""family"" entertainment value department. Of all that ""Holes"" has going against it, let's examine these maladies for all they're worth: First off, in judging the film's storyline, have the screenwriters ever heard of child labor laws? If the federal government found out the working conditions these children were subjected to, the people put in charge of this ""concentration camp"" would be serving at least a ten-year sentence in a federal prison, thus having the place shut down. The living conditions are nothing to write home about, either. Furthermore, the script is as tasteful as the food being served to these kids at this ""camp"" - being both bland and indigestible. In addition, the whole project lacks any discipline and approach, and is only appealing to your normal 4 to 8 year-old age range, many of whom would find the dialogue herein to be funny, of which most adults with even half an ounce of brain wouldn't even contort a chuckle. In short, if the entire family agrees to take in a movie at their local venue, a babysitter should be brought if the kids want to view ""Holes"", while it is highly recommended the adults see a movie that is on their level, thus suiting their tastes. As for the acting, both Sigourney Weaver and Henry Winkler are capable of much better. See Winkler's and Weaver's past dramatic and comedic output for further proof of their respective on-screen talents. ""Holes"" is definitely in the running for ""Worst Picture of 2003"", and that's a safe bet.

I am often disappointed when I read a great book and then see a movie from it that comes out so-so.  I decided I would enjoy the movie for what it was all on its own, and read the book later.  The other teachers I went to the the preview with had all read the book.  They all felt as I did that it was a wonderful movie-either as just a movie experience, or as a book made into a movie. They felt any deviations within the movie from the details of the book (either omitted for time constraints,  or for whatever reasons) did not distract from the fun experience of this movie.  Many felt it was about as true a translation from book to film as perhaps any successful book-to-movie has been up until now.  I am looking forward to purchasing the soundtrack also.  It fit the movie tone well without distracting or trying to be too hip or trendy.  Fun listening music that really added to the experience.
