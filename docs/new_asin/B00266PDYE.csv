It is still relevant today and would go down well with audiences still. Please release this on dvd for us all to enjoy, and that includes us fans in the United Kingdom. So make them either region free or release them worldwide. Come on sony, what are you thinking depriving us of this fabulous bit of TV?",1409875200,,476,4.241758241758242

8352194,5,B00266PDYE,Yes this is a good series but if hollywood is unsure about it's popularity then they should put the complete series out at a price that would have reflected the sum of total years of the series being sold on the market. Let those of us have the chance to  COLLECT THE COMPLETE SHOW if it doesn't sell as well as projected after only the first season is out. So many series are stopped after one season comes out and we are left hanging!!!!!!!!!!!!,1265760000,10,447,4.321428571428571
8352195,5,B00266PDYE,"This is a great show.  How much longer will we have to wait?  Pete Duel, Judy Carne, Rich Little, Barbara Bostock, Edith Atwater, Herb Voland.  What a great cast.  This romantic comedy is well written and well acted.  I'm buying at least two copies but probably more.  Please, Please get this out to DVD. I and many others have been waiting and looking for this for years!  This show when it originally aired had very high ratings.  Come on Sony the many fans are waiting and waiting.",1241913600,19,484,4.482758620689655
