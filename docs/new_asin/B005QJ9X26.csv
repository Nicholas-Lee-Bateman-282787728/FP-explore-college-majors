8483465,5,B005QJ9X26,"Classic Univeral Studios and James Whale movie...  The movie also explains why ""The Mummy's Hand"" sets looked so Mayan, not Egyptian...  Too bad this movie is in limited availability.",1367539200,4,183,5.275862068965517
8483466,2,B005QJ9X26,The movie was fine however the quality of the picture was poor. I was disapointed because I expected better. I paid way too much for a very bad print. Whoever copied this print came right off of TCM. Half way through a TCM logo appears. This is like a bootleg copy.,1361404800,5,265,4.215686274509804
