324567,4,6301031431,"This is entertainment at his best

with DINO and JERRY  LEWIS.

Highly recommended!",1173571200,,83,5.230769230769231
324568,5,6301031431,"Made in 1953, The Caddy was the best Martin & Lewis film to date, showing off both men's talents to the best of their ability.  Again there isn't whole lot of plot to their films, merely plot elements that frame the two star's unique talents.  This time Jerry is caddy Harvey Miller to Dean's Joe Anthony, who is a pro golfer.  Well, Harvey of course causes utter havok on the golf course, annoying everyone, including pro golfers Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, and Byron Nelson, playing themselves.  Utter craziness 30 years before the next great golf movie, ""Caddyshack"" would come along.

The gorgeous Donna Reed is in a supporting role as Kathy Taylor and does a fine job in her role.  Dean sings one of his most famous songs ever, ""Thats' Amore!"" which was nominated for an Academy Award.  The boys were really hitting thier stride now and on top of their game and the entertainment world with this wonderfully funny film.",1110499200,3,918,4.6645962732919255
324569,4,6301031431,"This is definitely one of their top movies together. This and The Stooge are right there together. Here is classic Lewis/Martin humor.  Good, clean fun.",1096070400,2,152,5.08
324570,4,6301031431,"This is more of classic Martin & Lewis!  They play off each other so well.  Here the goofy caddie (read Lewis) becomes the star golfer.
Songs are good, with That's Amore the headliner.  Never realized that this song came from this movie.
Lighthearted stuff that is so pleasing a contrast to today's shocking, revolting plots.  Very entertaining for the family.",988675200,4,360,4.95
324571,5,6301031431,Another one of my personal favorites. Along with The Stooge and Cinderfella. I love it when Dean sings That's Amore. But my favorite part is when Jerry's in the store on roller skates with all the dishes and stuff on  the shelves! you just know it will all end up on the floor  somehow. Hilarious!!,935020800,12,298,4.4

7810885,5,6301031431,The picture shows you how sons should stand up on their own two feet and work in the job they can do best in even if you have to go somewhere else to find it out or have some stranger tell you what your good doing,1362355200,,213,3.652173913043478
7810886,4,6301031431,"I really enjoyed watching movies from my youth. Compared to the movies they are showing now days we need more of the older movies. It's good to be able to watch a movie and have good humor and not sick humor. I am glad that Amazon give us that pleasure again by bring back old movies such as Caddy shack to watch and enjoy. The material I received was in good condition and I was able to watch the movie clearly.
Thanks Amazon. I liked when Amazon tell you the condition of the movie and give you fair prices.",1346716800,,509,4.151515151515151
7810887,5,6301031431,"I really enjoyed watching Jerry and Dean now that I am reading the autobiography.  I see some of the struggles that the two comedians faced. Jerry I don'tthink enjoyed always being the silly-willy, and Dean I don't think always enjoyed being the cool one.  Almost as if in between, they expressed wit to skirt around ""it"", and actually be more than just an act.  They really were hardworkers as if they were trying to show what living at that time was like for them. I particularly like the late fifties, California, Las Vegas, and the glitze of Hollywood, but only the good part they showed us.",1294531200,,595,4.59433962264151
