902001,5,630459352X,"To jump ahead, Act 4 of this opera lovers'opera is not to be believed!2 luminaires of the opera world combine to set the screen on fire! Such an idealistic beginning to have such a  tragic end. This is an epic Manon Lescaut. Dame Kiri,a wonderful
countess in Strauss'Capriccio,wrenches all my emotions to the surface with her portrayal of Manon Lescaut. Placido is magnicent
as the spurned lover returned. This presentation is a 2 hour master class. The beautiful melodies continually flow. Thomas Allen is a wonderful Lescaut. The orchestra of the Royal Opera house under Giuseppe Sinopoli is flawless. Not unlike Jacqueline Dupre,Fitz Wunderlich& Arlene Auger,Giuseppe Sinopoli was a musical genius taken too early from us by death. His passion for his art is most evident in his conducting of the intermezzo. What
a wonderful production! Bravo!Bravo! Bravo!",1081987200,24,860,5.231884057971015
902002,5,630459352X,"Esta version de 'Manon Lescaut' es sencillamente fantastica. La puesta en escena de GOTZ FRIEDERICH es visualmente muy atractiva, y teatralmente presenta momentos de gran interes dramatico. KIRI TE KANAWA es una protagonista de alto nivel, que consigue una gran version del rol pese a algunas pequeas tiranteces en el acto III. PLACIDO DOMINGO es un Dex Grieux sencillamente perfecto, tanto en lo vocal como en lo escenico. largo duo de Manon y Des Grieux en el acto final esta resuelto de forma antologica por los dos interpretes. El amplisimo elenco de cantantes secundarios rinde a gran nivel, al igual que la orquesta y el coro del Covent Garden, todos bajo la direccion de un muy inspirado GIUSEPPE SINOPPOLI.

902003,4,630459352X,"I'll agree with just about all the pluses above.  While Domingo does not show a lot of nuance in his performance, his voice is fresh and right on the mark with a ring that will make your spine tingle.  I've never heard Kiri sound better and I never thought of her as a great actress.  This definitely proved me wrong about her acting ability.  The only downside to this DVD is the soft focus due to age and captions what are minimal, or at least that's how they seemed.

The production values are excellent and singing unequaled, not even by Domingo in the Met production with Scotto.  This is one of Kiri's strongest roles and there is no tenor that can touch Domingo's ""favorite"" role.  Sir Thomas Allen is certainly one of my favorite baritones and is perfect as her brother.  The acting is all on a par with the singing.  I love this one and purchased one of the first VHS with subtitles so I'm happy with the quality of the tape, if a little faded.  When I convert to DVD I'll definitely buy this again.  Buy it if you love these singers, Puccini and Covent Garden!",995587200,43,675,4.439024390243903

They are in great voice and all of them are truly good actors, too.  I really wish I could recommend this video. But the original VHS release is now out of print, and the releasing company made a terrible decision of recording it on EP mode, thus producing an inferior quality in video transfer. At the price tag of $30, this is totally unacceptable.",976492800,25,550,4.5
902006,4,630459352X,"This is a very decent production of the Puccini masterpiece, marred only (for some) by the Spanish subtitles--since this was obviously taken off the air from some Spanish telecast. The packaging informs us that the  production is from 1990, the title role is sung by Mirella Freni and Des  Grieux by Petr Dvorsky, and Silvio Varviso conducts. [Amazon.com lists the  latter as Director.] Even the tape itself does not tell us the rest of the  cast or even the house in which the opera is presented. Now, Bel Canto,  this is not very user friendly. In fact, when I phoned for information, I  got was the warehouse that told me the video was no longer available!
  Now Freni is of course no longer in her vocal bloom, but what she had in  1990 is formidable and deserving of the long Bravas her two arias receive  from a very enthusiastic audience. The notes on the slipcase state that  Dvorsky ""More artist than vocalist"" (what in heaven is that  supposed to mean?) ""sometimes sounds taxed above the staff."" Add  to that some fairly wooden acting, please.
  And yet I thoroughly  enjoyed this production. The use of a Comedia dell' Arte troupe to comment  in mime on the action in the first act is not too intrusive...and it is  interesting to see one of them among the woman prisoners in the Le Harvre  scene. The scenery is not elaborate but functional and only now and then  does the picture get a little fuzzy. On the other hand, it did not have the  video problems the more elaborate Metropolitan Opera version has.
  I  liked the baritone playing Lescaut and the Geronte for once was not a total  clown. And I did appreciate being able to hear the give and take of these  two in the first scene over the chorus that usually drowns them out in live  productions. The prompter, unfortunately, is also audible fairly  consistently.
  So if you can read Spanish, I would certainly recommend  this video. If not, well the performances are strong enough to overcome  that feature.",954201600,7,1978,4.627167630057803

902135,5,630459352X,"Domingo and Te Kanawa were at their best and can recommend this production to anyone desiring to see Puccini's ""Manon Lescaut"" performed at its best.",1392249600,,149,5.0
902136,5,630459352X,"This is a traditional performance of Manon Lescaut, with predominantly appropriate scenery and, for the most part, appropriate costuming. The ""glitches"" are minor, except for one and that one is the fault of Puccini's insufficient knowledge but we'll get to that, as we get there.
 Overall, the quality of Te Kanawa's and Domingo's voices are at or just approaching their peaks. Their interaction was superb and totally realistic, especially in the death scene of Act 3.
 This is a 1983 recording and we have to accept the quality of audio and video technology of that era; yet, despite those ""limitations,"" the singing quality shines through. Now, having said that, I also understand that, thirty or so years from now, when we've all become accustomed to super high resolution, 3-D, holographic video and equal-to-live performance audio, we will say similar things, about the ""inabilities and limitations"" of today's audio-video technology. That's the nature of technology and each generation will come to understand/accept, as ""normal,"" the standard with which they grew up. Some of us, who remember when the only audio was radio or vinyl, as well as, later, when we obtained small-screen, fuzzy, black and white TVs, will more appreciate my comments, in this area.
  There were a few, very minor ""glitches,"" such as when Manon's brother rushes in, to warn that Manon has been denounced and that the guards and archers are coming, to arrest them. A few moments thereafter, the gendarmes arrive, all bearing muskets, with not an archer to be found. Why Puccini wrote the word ""archers"" into the libretto I never understood. The bow was not a common-use tool of the military or police, in that era. They are, also, all in red uniforms, with white trim. If my memory serves, the French uniform, of that era, was blue and cream, while the British uniform was what we saw here and, later, at the prison. Yes, a minor issue but, as a bit of an historian, I tend to notice such items.
 The most substantial ""glitch"" must, of course, be attributed to Puccini's lack of knowledge, concerning the topography and geology of what was then ""French America,"" i.e., the Louisiana region. To set the final act in a desert-like area, in Louisiana, is a stretch. The closest that region gets to desert-like conditions is when the depth of the water, in the shallow swamps, gets down to only an inch or two.
  Overall, this is a highly recommended presentation and, despite the minor ""glitches,"" it deserves a full five stars, if for nothing but the quality of the singing and acting of Te Kanawa and Domingo.",1383091200,4,2592,4.890660592255125
902137,5,630459352X,"Greetings All, What a great opera this is! Kiri and Placido together really make a go of it! Singing and acting for whole production was awesome! The last act brought me to tears, very heartfelt! Copy was clear and sound wonderful! Would buy from seller again! Cheers! William",1378339200,2,276,4.770833333333333
902138,5,630459352X,"Of the four Manon Lescaut DVDs available, none is perfect, but this one comes close to it.
Kiri TeKanawa is surprisingly good in this part, but it is Domingo's ""show"".
His voice and acting throughout is outstanding, but especially in the Third act; the scene when he begs the ship captain to take him is just heartbreaking, it's hard to hold the tears back.
The second in my opinion is the The Met with Domingo and Scotto, but the video quality leaves a lot to be desired.
The third one is the La Scala with Guleghina and Jose Cura, Cura fares better,although I like Guleghina a lot, her voice is better in the spinto roles, but visually they look the parts they play as attractive young lovers.
The Met outing with Karita Mattila and Marcello Giordani is not very interesting, the production is rather in poor taste and they don't look young enough to pass for adventurous young lovers.

902141,4,630459352X,"Kiri Te Kanawa was often accused by critics of being dramatically uninvolved in what she was singing, but whenever she was in Placido Domingo's orbit, she lit up like a Christmas tree!  She didn't habitually perform with the commitment she managed when Domingo was in front of her--whether he just inspired her or turned her on, she really engaged when he was around. (And really, what girl can't understand that? He was at his absolute prettiest at the time!)  Beginning in the early 80's, the two often performed together (even in a televised charity golf outing), and always threw off sparks on stage (see their Otello together also on DVD).  With Renata Scotto in the U.S. and Te Kanawa in London, Domingo was inspired to wonderful performances of this opera--and since he left the role of Des Grieux behind by the middle of that decade, we are fortunate to be able to witness him on video performing it with sopranos of such different strengths and emphases.

Domingo was perhaps the finest Des Grieux in the last 50 years, and also one of the greatest Puccini singers, and Te Kanawa captured the capriciousness and vulnerability of Manon. Neither was in perfectly optimal voice for this production run; they both got sick and Dame Kiri barely made it onstage.  Her sound is a bit weaker and stringier than usual, not able to really bloom to fill out big moments--and he oversings a bit to carry some climaxes as a result.  Nevertheless, this is an excellent document of what they were capable of at a hair below par, flinging themselves into the work, and a terrific performance it is.  The conducting gets a little wayward and drags at times (Sinopoli could be brilliant but maddeningly variable), although this could have been due to trying to help an ill singer.

The remastered DVD is considerably improved from the original DVD release, which was a terrible transfer from an EP (extended-play) copy of the original VHS--and as such, was actually worse than a VHS copy.  (What was the point of that, I wonder?  It's as if some exec said, ""Uh-oh, everybody's putting stuff out on DVD.  What do  we have that we could put out?""  ""Well, all we have right now is this awful, washed out, blurry copy of Manon Lescaut, so we should wait until we have a better copy.""  ""Naw, go ahead and put it out.  Who cares!  They'll never know the difference!"") So long as you acquire the remastered DVD rather than its terrible predecessor, you will have some idea what the production actually looked like.

The big problem is always Manon Lescaut itself: Puccini's breakout opera has some of the most extravagantly beautiful duets Puccini ever wrote and very attractive characters, but on the whole it's an unbalanced work.  The third act is underpinned by no action for the singers to sing ABOUT, so they can give it nothing except whatever degree of intensity they can muster as they paw one another and roll around in the desert singing endlessly as they die--really, really slowly.  Puccini didn't quite have the control over dramatic arc that he would later have, and he had the habit of writing utterly thankless supporting roles of the kind that demand, but don't attract, truly first-rate singers.",1300492800,8,3198,4.781818181818182
902262,5,630459352X,Domingo and Te Kenawa at their peak at the Royal Opera Covent Garden!! What more can I say. I have not seen other versions but I cannot image this can be surpassed...thanks for all your fine reviews. It really helped me to pick what is probably the definitive Manon Lescaut.,1297641600,,274,4.5
902263,2,630459352X,"I don't know; may be Domingo would be much better off in 1980's MET version with Renata Scotto in the title role. That DVD, however, has been discontinued, while this truly second rate stuff received rave reviews and is still commercially available.
Without even going into Scotto's performance there. Kiri Te Kanawa was a white hot property in 1983 in Covent Garden, having sung in St. Paul's Cathedral just 2 years earlier at the wedding of Charles and Diana.
However great a lyrical soprano she is, to cast her as Manon Lescaut is among one of the greatest operatic blunder in the recorded era.
She hasn't got the colour, the prowess, the expression. A very bland and vocally uninteresting Manon Lescaut, despite her relatively good acting skills (as compared to other sopranos).
She is particularly bland and vocally helpless in the last Act, where the dramatic climax lies. And I could not help noticing that she's far more matronly than the role demands in terms of demeanour, and far to noble and reserved. In short, even in terms of acting, she is Kiri Te Kanawa and NEVER was Manon Lescaut.
What is it if not hype?
I would be pleased to know.",1246752000,5,1151,4.702970297029703
902264,5,630459352X,"This is a wonderful DVD. I just can't stop watching it. Domingo is consistently great throughout his career, but here in particular, he is outstanding. Domingo and Te Kanawa are perfect for the leading roles. They sing and act superbly. Sinopoli's conducting is original and powerful. Everytime I watch this DVD, I enjoy watching him conducting right before Act 3. I'm very happy that I bought it.",1176422400,4,397,4.940298507462686
902265,4,630459352X,"I found more black and white in this performance than most of the reviewers here. Acts 3 and 4 were glorious. Kiri te Kanawa and Domingo knock sparks off eachother on stage. Domingo lives the part and brings out the very best in Kiri who, for once, acts instead of looking at herself in the mirror. It seems that when Manon is reduced to rags, Kiri sheds her affectations and sings from the heart. Sinopoli's conducting is outstanding. He manages to make you listen to this potentially-hackneyed work with new ears, finding an untrodden path without sounding perverse or self-conscious. Speeds are generally fast, articulation still clear.

But most of the first two acts I found dragged a little. Maybe Puccini takes some of the blame, but to me the supporting cast, after Allen and the two principals, was underpowered. When Domingo isn't on stage, the temperature drops ten degrees, even Te Kanawa going into suspended animation. Acting in the crowd scenes is rather wooden, direction earthbound.

Through it all the orchestra shines. For that, and the last two acts, this is well worth watching.",1145404800,15,1099,4.935135135135135
902266,5,630459352X,"Manon Lescaut is one of those operas that has all the elements to be a classic. Beautiful music, poignant story and a tragic end. And of course, it is Puccini's! true that it is not his best one. But not because he was not done his best but because he was still walking towards his perfection in style that would achieve later with Tosca or Turandot.

The story based on a novel by I'Abbe Prevost, was a popular example of the moral novels of the XVIIIth. A young girl who in her way to the convent scapes kidnapping by an old noble, with the help of her ambitious brother, and run away with a young poet. To be later the lover of that old aristocrat till her love appears again. In revenge she is imprisioned and sent to the French colony of Florida. Des Grieux, her lover, follow her and she ends tragically in the swamps of Florida.

So with this dramatic story Puccini creates a beautiful opera. A beauty that starts since the first act to get its peak in the third and ends in that dramatic end.  Sinopoli was a wonderful director. His conducting was powerful and energetic, but , when is required also tender. Only watching him is an spectacle by itself. The way the orchestra plays the prelude is one of those that make you cry, literally.

And about the singers I think the cast is excellent. Ok, I admit I always like Placido Domingo, even when I should not. But here he is perfect. He has the voice, the looks, the manners to be the perfect Des Grieux. . When he sings ""Donna non vidi mai"" you suddenly understand why people like opera. Listing to him is a pleasure.

About Kiri Te Kanawa I am sure that although those who think she is a light soprano must admit she sings here beautifully. How she changes from the first act to the end is something that only she could have done. About her flawless, well I consider that a matter of opinion. She shows an splendid technique and evidently she is not Callas. But who is? Her clarity, and emotion is something to be considered. It is not that she was worse or better , they have different ways to approach to the character. And I find her Manon still the best.,above Ms Fleming's, Ms Frenni's or whoever. Because here she had found the perfect balance between performing and singing and that is always something difficult to accomplish.

This production is perfect. I admit I prefer classic productions for this kind of operas. Everything is perfect although I guess that the edition of this dvd it is not as good as it should. I remember  watching this opera live from the Covent Garden on tv  and the coulours were  a little bit stronger. But even with that I think it is a dvd that a good opera aficionado should have or even if you are not.

Recently I purchased DVD's of ""Le Villi"" and ""Edgar"" from Acorn.  There are composers and writers where you can see, through their works, their growth and greatness.  Puccini is one of those.  To see ""Le Villi"" and then see ""Turandot"" is a revelation.
Having said that, one opera that I have tended to ignore is ""Manon Lescaut"".  I don't know why, but now I know I never will again.  This video of ""Manon Lescaut"" with Domingo, Te Kanawa and Allen is incredible.  I confess, I cry for Puccini's heroines, and this one was no exception.  By the time they were loading the women onto the ship, tears were falling.  The director, Brian Large, deserves special applause for that scene.
