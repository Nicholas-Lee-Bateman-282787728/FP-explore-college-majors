2521669,5,B000EJ9RNS,"Actually, no one has heard of this movie before. Overlooked for 32 years, The Noah is the first and only film by director Daniel Bourla. And that's a darn shame.

The movie plays like a great Twilight Zone episode. Remember the episode where the bookworm wishes he were the last person on earth, so he can read all the books to his hearts content without distractions? Of course, he gets his wish.  And just when he begins his book reading marathon, his eyeglasses break.

The Noah is similar, in an inverted way. After years of service in the military, The Noah (played by Robert Strauss), planned to spend his remaining years on his pension somewhere peaceful, quiet... where he could relax. Maybe a nice beach side property off the coast of Florida.

Instead, a nuclear holocaust. The Noah is swept to an exotic coast in South East Asia  and is the last man on earth.

At first, The Noah almost enjoys his solitude. But quickly loneliness sets in. To cope, The Noah creates a trumpet playing Army Private named Friday. Friday inevitably becomes lonely. In good faith, The Noah creates a girlfriend for Friday whom he calls Friday Anne.

Three is a crowd when The Noah and Friday Anne don't see eye to eye.  From here on out nothing holds The Noah back until he's created a school... a town... a civilization.

Watch The Noah for the interesting story, wonderful performance, interesting cinematography, and directing. You will think about it for days and days...",1149638400,13,1465,4.7362204724409445
8110573,5,B000EJ9RNS,"In the 1970's, my late father was asked to play his horn (a cornet, not a trumpet) for a movie soundtrack. His horn would be the ""voice"" of a character in the movie. He was recorded outside, in the quietest spot available then. As a teenager, I didn't know much more about the project than that. And until 2017, I was unaware that the movie had ever been released, until one of my siblings saw a movie featuring the actor who starred in ""The Noah"", and did some sleuthing. Thanks to Amazon, we now own a copy of this ahead-of-its-time apocalyptic film and can hear the sweet soulful phrasings of our dad, Jim Blackmore. It's so amazingly cool to see him credited onscreen, along with the three human actors (who were all quite famous at the time); the late Robert Strauss, the late Geoffrey Holder and Sally Kellerman. All four roles focus on the sound of the actor's voice, and those voices pull us, the viewers, into the head and heart of Strauss's military character in a post nuclear war world. I have learned that ""The Noah"" has become a cult classic in terms of its storyline, writing, direction and acting techniques. It certainly made me wonder if the team behind the  2000 film ""Cast Away"" had seen it and been inspired. It's a movie not easily forgotten, from a time I hope we never experience. And yet I am profoundly happy to once again hear the sound of my own father's ""voice"" as his horn plays during ""The Noah"".",1516838400,,1427,4.4884615384615385

8110576,4,B000EJ9RNS,"""The Noah"" certainly is amongst the most unusual films I ever saw - and I watched thousands of movies in my life. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

There are many things unclear about ""The Noah"", beginning with its classification. Is it a sci-fi post apocalyptic film? Is it rather some kind of modern fantasy? Or is it an experimental kind of drama? Honestly, it can be either one - or all above... The director himself said in an interview in 1997: ""It was meant to be an anti-war film for the revolution of the 1960s"". You will have to decide by yourself how to classify this UFO (Unidentified Film-like Object)...

It is also not clear what year of production attach to ""The Noah"". It was made in 1968 but then shelved without release for no less than seven years. It was shown in an extremely limited release in 1975 in couple of New York cinemas and then immediately re-shelved again, until 1997, when it was shown on a local New York TV channel - once. Finally, it was released on DVD (region 1) in 2006.

The film was written and directed made by Daniel Bourla, a quite enigmatic character about whom about I managed to find just that:

- he is a Greek Jew born in Thessaloniki before WWII
- he is a Holocaust survivor
- after 1945 he lived in USA where he studied and started a career in film-making, but turning mostly commercials
- he was a good friend with late Dalton Trumbo,
- he is a very left-winged person (it shows very much in the film too)
- he left the USA in the 50s, discouraged by senator McCarthy's anti-communist crusade
- he never made another feature film before or since ""The Noah""
- he was later working mostly in foreign-film distribution in United States (including porn) and as TV-channel manager in Italy and Greece

To continue with unusual: although made in 1968, this is a black and white film. More unusual: there is only ONE (yes, ONE) actor appearing in this film - there are however sompe other actors heard, as the main character hears many voices... Even more unusual: the main actor, Robert Strauss (1913-1975), died almost immediately after this film was turned, before even the full copy was assembled...

The plot is also somehow unusual. It begins after a nuclear war, when a somehow aged US soldier lands on a deserted tropical island, where he finds the abandoned ruins of what seems to be a small post of Chicom (Chinese communist) Army. The soldier starts a dialogue with the public, when in the same time organising his life of Robinson Crusoe. After some time, exhausted by solitude, he will start creating some imaginary friends - and will ask them to call him ""The Noah"". That covers like first 5 minutes - I will say no more about the rest...

I had very mixed feelings when watching this film and I found it very difficult to rate. I couldn't really understand well what this film was about, but I certainly have NO SYMPATHY at all with the general message ""The Noah"" tried to convey, such as I understood it. It seemed to me, that the director tried to picture the whole human history as an absurd and painful march to madness and self-destruction and also to show that all pillars on which our societies are build: family, religion, education, business, invention, etc. are just some kind of absurd illusion. In fact, ""The Noah"" seems really like a nihilist pamphlet. And finally, this film conveys a pathological, obsessional, morbid hatred of United States and of soldiers - especially American soldiers! Once again, I am not certain if that was the message the director intended - but that was the one I got, and I ABSOLUTELY HATED IT!

That being said, ideological differences set aside, I still rate this film highly, for:

- originality and creativity - this is very definitely not something you see everyday...
- Robert Strauss performance - I never saw something like that in my whole life...
- humor - even if I am myself a Christian, I will never, NEVER forget the parody of expulsion of Adam and Eve from paradise. I almost broke some ribs laughing at that moment...)))
- scenography - the ""design"" of Noah's island and especially of the abandoned Chicom Army outpost deserved an Oscar: it is not an exaggeration

So all in all, this is a film definitely worth seeing, even if it is only once. It will probably please most left-winged people and to some extend upset at least some conservatives (like me) - but it certainly will not leave anybody bored. See it and make your own mind.",1376265600,,4473,4.608040201005025
8110577,2,B000EJ9RNS,"The last man on Earth after a nuclear holocaust (Robert Strauss) finds himself on a Pacific island, seemingly a Chinese military base from the way it is outfitted. As he slowly descends into madness in his loneliness, he creates imaginary characters to keep him company. Strauss, the sole visible character in the film (there are also voices of his imaginary creations) certainly gets an A for effort, but he is not a strong enough actor to carry a film such as this (one need only recall Tom Hanks' wonderful performance in Cast Away). Writer-director Daniel Bourla doesn't seem to be making any point: it's not a film about survival or even adaptation to his surroundings. (the camp is amazingly well-equipped - a seemingly endless supply of food, an even a golf club and golf balls, not to mention a copy of How To Win Friends And Influence People - strange reading material for a Chinese Army camp!). And as he more and more loses touch with reality, is the soundtrack we hear supposed to reflect what is going on in his mind (military music, political speeches covering much of mid-20th Century history, fellow soldiers, etc.) or is it supposed to serve as the director's commentary? If the former, then it does not make any sense - no matter how mad ""Noah"" might be becoming, he is not going to hallucinate in Russian, Chinese, German, French, and Italian! If the latter, then it only serves as a distraction - the viewer should be focused on the character's madness, not the director's point of view. This might have made a good Twilight Zone episode, but it just doesn't play well when dragged out for almost two hours. Nevertheless, from the other reviews it is clear that this film certainly has its advocates, so perhaps you ought to judge for yourselves.",1340668800,,1766,4.737012987012987

8110579,5,B000EJ9RNS,"I'm gonna make this short.

Yes, I look at those end of the world movies--none of them are written the way I think things would happen.  Futher, when you get to the last human on earth type story--there's ALWAYS more humans.

Not so, this one.  Our military person--private Noah is the last human on earth.  Finally, someone did such a movie.

Anyway, so as not to drag on, or give away secrets of the film, let me just add a few things here;

1.  Noah joined up in 1941.  He was a thirty year man.  He was just a few months short of finishing his 30 year tour when nuclear world war broke out.  From the moment he first comes on camera he has a three month beard (he shaves it off one time)...by the end of the movie he has a six month beard.  Therefore, I calculate the story takes place somewhere between 1971 and 1973.

2.  Two,...how on earth could a thirty year man muster out of the military as only a private?!  (he must have been some hell rasier).

3.  I think that last night of his going through the junkyard had somesort of special message, some of us missed.  I'm not sure, but I 'think' his dilusions were how WWII started, and took us up through NASA's barn storming days. (all because the American soldiers made the world safe).  Then, the civilian populations of the world started getting mouthy and causing trouble (or at least talking like they were going to cause trouble all over again)--this is the point Noah comes out side of his barracks for the third time I thing.

Apparently, the civil unrest was too much for the militaries which reacted.

World War Three broke out.

4.  Finally, I wish they'd used better dialogue in the junkyard scenes and other off camera voices saying other things so this would have been clearer.  I like the movie.  I really do--but for the same cost (and slightly altered dialogue) it could have been great.  I would like to sneak one **SPOILER ALERT** in here.  The next day--when the rains were over, after Noah wipes off that mirror, he turns around and sees his old fatigue uniform...it says U.S. Army.  He then sees his Class A dress Uniform and the radiation badge on it...the white radiation badge is now black.**END OF SPOILER**.

Anyway, I recommend this movie to everybody who likes a little more intelligence with their art than 'Harlotwood' is grinding out nowadays.  Oh yes, don't expect the usual sciencefiction trappings.  In realitly, this is fiction--not really science fiction--maybe leaning toward horror just a little.  No spaceships, no sluts, no robots, no mass murder--just some good old fashion drama by a writer and director and actor who had a clue on just how to make a movie...with one actor on camera.  I really wish they would remake this movie...but we all know what gollywood churns out as a 'remake'--maybe they should leave it alone?

Here's a toast to the American Veterian of WWII and yes (I'll say it), the British and the Free French.
bye.",1234915200,,2932,4.575
8110580,4,B000EJ9RNS,"Try this terrific look at madness/escapism when amidst isolation, desperation & loneliness created by one's accepted duty to country & society.
A very interesting & extremely well done film focusing on one soldier's situation in the South Pacific during WWII., fitting nicely into the ' intelligent Sci-Fi ' category ( not your usual Sci-Fi ).
Strange, thoughtful & certainly unique.
One of my favorite films that try to take on human possibilities.
A excellent flick for those who prefer good films apart from the usual ' action filled ', mindless entertainment style so prevalent these days.",1231718400,3,593,5.1875
8110581,4,B000EJ9RNS,"""The Noah"" is a fascinating film.  Shot in black and white and featuring but one on-screen player, veteran character actor Robert Strauss (this was his final film), the movie is ostensibly about the final survivor of a nuclear holocaust.  A career army man whose entire adult life has been regulated by rules and schedules, the survivor--who begins to call himself ""The Noah""--eventually invents fantasy companions (voiced by Sally Kirkland and Geoffrey ""The Uncola"" Holder) and, indeed, an entire world woven from memory fragments.

But it seems to me that director Daniel Bourla has a deeper message in mind than just another apocalypse story.  Strauss' character gradually fragments and erodes, and this dissolution is surely an allegory for the creeping madness that led to the nuclear holocaust that is the film's backdrop.  Moreover, Strauss' recreation from memory of an entire world invites the viewer to reflect on just how much of his or her understanding of reality is an accurate reflection of what actually is, and how much of it is created narrative.

The film was lost for a few years until the original 35mm negative was located and reprinted.  In my copy, the soundtrack is out of sync with the visuals for the final 15 minutes or so of the film.  But I don't know is this flaw is unique to my copy, or if its intrinsic to the negatives.

""The Noah"" is provocative, and offers some good cinematography.  The scenes involving Strauss, the imaginary army, and the rainstorm are particularly good, and the final shot is haunting.  But the film is over-long--as is the rainstorm sequence--and a half hour or so could easily have been edited out.  Three and a half stars.",1221004800,3,1683,4.908127208480566
8110582,3,B000EJ9RNS,"Being a fan of post apocalyptic movies this was a must-see for me. Though the film is bit dated, a bit long and slow, I am glad I did. It is Robinson Crusoe taken to the next level. Strange the director never made any other films.",1168300800,6,230,4.021739130434782
