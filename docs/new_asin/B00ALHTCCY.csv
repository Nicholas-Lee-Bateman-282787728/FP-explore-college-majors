8553315,3,B00ALHTCCY,A mixed bag. The Andy Williams duet is among the worst performances on view ever. The rest is: okay.,1462492800,,100,4.315789473684211
8553316,5,B00ALHTCCY,"This was a gift for my father. The beautiful songs and performers from Pat Boone's tv show from the late 1950s are enjoyed by folks aged 80s through late 90s in his assisted living home. And, I love it, too. All of us, plus employees, sing along with Pat and the guests who graced his stage - including Ella Fitzgerald, Nat Cole, and Mel Torme.",1461196800,,344,4.3076923076923075

8553319,5,B00ALHTCCY,"Love Letters In The Sands Of Time is a great salute to the 1950's. My particular favorite is a 1959 appearance by Connie Francis on Pat Boone's show. They duet on Connie's #2 pop charted hit My Happiness. Fans of Connie Francis, and lovers of 1950's pop music will like this the most.",1433980800,5,284,4.377358490566038
8553320,2,B00ALHTCCY,"This DVD contains some goodies, like the only known live tv performance of Danny & The Juniors (no lip synch!) Too bad the DVD was edited the wrong way. The original 4:3 picture is stretched to 16:9. As a result the artists on this DVD look fat and ugly.",1381795200,3,254,4.204081632653061
