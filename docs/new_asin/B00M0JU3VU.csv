__________________________________________________________
Like I said earlier, there are 13 Mythbuster Collections, and most seasons
are available as well... THIS told ME what
I
wanted to know.
Hope it helps!
Oh! And the asking-price is great right now, really!

I do NOT know what's on [FUTURE] Collections 14 & 15, but 36 of these shows
are already on Collections 1 through 13. Maybe if the next 14 episodes are NOT
the ones repeated, here, I'll buy this collection... we'll see.

6529859,3,B00M0JU3VU,"Ive watched a bunch of Mythbusters episodes, although I couldn't tell you what order they all came in. Thats one of the virtues of the series, that any given show can be watched in any order, since they stand alone.

If you're not familiar with the show, each installment takes on a few myths, although these days, its as likely to be a viral video as a classic urban myth. The team, with their special effects experience, builds something  a measurement apparatus, a fake house, a rebuilt car, a dummy equivalent to a person  to test whether an assumption is plausible, confirmed, or busted. Many times, things blow up, or firearms are involved.

I was looking forward to the Mythbusters 10th Anniversary Collection because I loved the concept. Each of the five cast members  Adam Savage, Jamie Hyneman, Grant Imahara, Kari Byron, and Tory Belleci  picked ten favorite episodes, making for fifty shows to watch (on ten discs, out of 222 episodes through 2014).

Unfortunately, this set isn't nearly as interesting as it could have been, since theres nothing here but episodes. Theres no explanation of why a particular person chose their selections, and theres no information on where in the series a particular installment fell, and there are no special features. So instead of seeming like an anniversary celebration, this seems more like a way to sell the show in another arrangement. (Im also confused by the 10th Anniversary mention, since the show debuted in 2003, making this year the 12th Anniversary.)

Fans probably already know all these episodes. As a less dedicated follower, I found this set neat as a kind of sampler pack, with famous show moments like Alcatraz Escape, Confederate Rocket, and Five Second Rule.
