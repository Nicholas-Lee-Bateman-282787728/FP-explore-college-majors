8333725,5,B001PKZBA8,"I love this series, I have been looking for it for years.
About four years ago Amazon had it on vhs, but, it was about  $ 25.00, way to much for a vhs.
Amazon needs to get it released if they have to make it them selves .
Please , please, please,  release this for the U.S and Canada !",1388880000,10,285,3.7333333333333334

8333728,5,B001PKZBA8,"One of my favorite movies. I was so excited when I saw it on Amazon, then read the description and realized it was Region 2. Since I don't really want to buy a multi-format DVD Player, guess I'm out of luck. Really wish they would release this for Region 1.",1353888000,2,257,4.16

8333731,2,B001PKZBA8,"I originally made a comment regarding a recent order that I was unhappy with. It was a DVD that I had long been looking for.  I was unhappy because it was not in English.  As an update, just want to say that I did not quite understand the description, that it was in German, so partly my error.  I do think that in the future it should be at the top of the description, not as a footnote.  But again, it was my error.",1306713600,4,417,3.9285714285714284
