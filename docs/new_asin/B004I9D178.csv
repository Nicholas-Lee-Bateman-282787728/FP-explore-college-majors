8430432,5,B004I9D178,This is a wonderful show. Seo Woo is one of my favorite Korean actresses. She gives an awesome performance but I was also blown away by the other main character's performance who plays her cold hearted sister. Wow! The drama has a few funny moments but it's mostly sad and intense. This is a drama I wouldn't mind seeing over and over again! .-_-,1338249600,2,346,4.421875
