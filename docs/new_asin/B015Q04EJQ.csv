Very shady sales tactics.",1519603200,,196,3.925
8734276,1,B015Q04EJQ,"I only gave it a one star because I like the movie. I didn't know that it came from out of the country. When I received it ,it wouldn't play. Word of advice unless you are from Great Britain and have a DVD player from there that's the only way this movie will play. It cost me $15 to return a $8 movie.",1491004800,,302,3.8095238095238093
