7856463,5,6303953328,"Having seen 'Jonny Quest' when aired for the first time, I can't resist watching it! I still prefer VHS but, I guess I'll have to start buying DVDs. There's no singing, the bodyguard doubles as the nanny, and they always manage to get out of the trouble they find! All this and a cute dog, too.",1381276800,,294,4.267857142857143
7856464,5,6303953328,I am finishing my collection of Jonny Quest dvd and vhs and this was one that I could not have done without. It was sent fast and I have already viewed it several times.,1356998400,,169,4.0
7856465,5,6303953328,"I do not usually review VHS releases that are over a decade old, but this really was a nice set. There were only four tapes in the set but they really captured the best of the series. In fact, if you can't afford the full 26 episode DVD release (and you still have a VHS player) these tapes are still an excellent review or introduction to the classic 1964 series. They were digitally remastered so they are bright and sharp to watch with clear, full sound. It's funny, but in some ways they seem more modern, and optimistic, than anything being produced these days. They really predicted an incredible amount of present day technology.

1) Race Bannon in An Army of One includes: Mystery of the Lizard Men, and Double Danger, plus a Space Ghost cartoon (Heat Thing.)

2) Dr. Zin in Master of Evil includes: Riddle of the Gold, and The Robot Spy, plus a Space Ghost cartoon (Creature King.)

3) Hadji in Mysteries of the East includes: Calcutta Adventure, and Pirates from Below, plus a Space Ghost Cartoon (Revenge of the Spider Woman.)

4) Bandit in Adventures Best Friend includes Attack of the Tree People, and Terror Island, plus a Space Ghost Cartoon (Zorak.)",1190246400,4,1165,4.640776699029126
7856466,5,6303953328,"In my opinion this one is the best.  They are early episodes but show how come Jonny Quest was the greatest cartoon of the 60's.  Too bad only one season aired.
The episodes featured here are the classic MYSTERY OF THE LIZARDMEN and DOUBLE DANGER.  Both are consideried some of the finest episodes.  Plus a bonus world premier toon and a classic episode of Space Ghost featuringthe Molten Monster! Cool huh?
I would reccommend that you get this before it goes out of print!  These are true classic that onlycome around once every 20 years. So I suggest you get it.",984787200,19,564,4.544554455445544
7856467,5,6303953328,"This is the best cartoon that ever existed. When I was growing up, every little boy wanted to be Johnny Quest. This is SOOOO much better than JQ:TRA because the new stuff is so geared to the POKEMON generation.
Buy this so they'll release more!!",976752000,7,245,4.466666666666667
