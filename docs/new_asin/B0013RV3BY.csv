8252747,5,B0013RV3BY,"I ordered this for a friend and then watched it myself.  At first, I thought, ""a woodworking video - how much fun could that be?""  but within a few minutes of listening and watching I was totally hooked.  It is funny, entertaining and interesting as well.  Anthony Beverly is utterly charming and thanks to Jeff Dreisbach, I'm off to search the woods for twigs to begin experimenting with my lino knife.  Graham Blackburn is an excellent host and makes it all fun as he shows us what  various woodworkers can do.  Excellent editing keeps your attention easily.
Highly recommend it and will definitely subscribe.",1208217600,2,611,4.8173076923076925
