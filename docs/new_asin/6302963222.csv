7832980,2,6302963222,"This item is misidentified.  Lothar is some author and has no connection with this tape. I bought this used through Amazon.com and it is a recording of a live broadcast from Dresden in 1992.  The performance includes only three of the six cantatas that make up the Christmas Oratorio.  The performance is lackluster and the video is fuzzy, having been converted to NTSC from the European PAL video system.  The audio has a strange tapping noise heard between numbers.  The harpsichord gets increasingly out of tune as the performance goes on.  Someone bought this video when a public library dumped it and has foisted it off onto unsuspecting Internet buyers.  The best performance on video is conducted by Beringer and includes all six cantatas and no strange noises.",1100649600,3,768,4.953125
