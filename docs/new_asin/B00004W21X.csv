1359289,5,B00004W21X,"The third series of this classic series is set against the events leading to WW2, and concludes in the final episode with the partners departing their beloved Darroby to fight for all they hold most dear in the war, following it's outbreak.

James Herriot is very happily married to Helen, and a half partner to Seigfried, with the latters younger Brother Tristan, still struggling to qualify as a vet. Despite the impending disaster of the war, life must go on, and here it does with another joyful collection of episodes including ""Charity Begins at Home"" with Seigfried determined to teach his partners an example in cost cutting...if only he practised what he preaches! ""Hair of the Dog"" where James is unable to resist a visit from Granville Bennet, a gregarious local vet with a taste for drink! ""Matters of Life and Death"" Seigfried and Tristan attend a military function, with dire concequences for Tristan!

The last episode, ""Big Steps and Little 'uns"" sees both James and Seigfried depart for the war, and contains a great scene by the fireside where James explains to Seigfried why he loves hs life in Darrowby so much, yet has to leave to defend it.

Although intended as the conclusion to this wonderfuil series, All Creatures returned some years later, post war, to continue to stories of the life and times of the partners.  It continued to be hugely entertaining, but after this series 3 was no longer  based on the books by James Herriot, and new writers were brought in. Subsequently, it never quite recaptured the magic of the early stories. Even though at times, it came close..",1121558400,19,1599,4.821167883211679
1359290,4,B00004W21X,"The Production: The TV series ""All Creatures Great & Small"" started in Great Britain on January 1978 with no nonsense photography with the typical grain of that time period. This DVD box set is from the third season, which played in January through June 1979. Some photography scenes were taken direct off Yorkshire farms. There are very little special effects, the only ones I can think of is either drugged or fake animals to act out certain quick scenes. Were some of the animals trained to act like they were sick or dying? Sometimes certain operations were preformed with a human hand, checking the rear of certain animals for pregnancies or intestinal problems. At times when the actors themselves are seen performing inspections on the animals, their hands were either hidden behind the animals or the actors makes facial expressions with the lower parts of their bodies off the screen. In this series, in one scene the main Veterinarian uses his free hand to cover the area where the needle is ""Supposedly"" going into the neck of the animal. Very down to Earth & as real as possible with great effect.
The Actors: Christopher Timothy plays James Herriot, a Scottish newly qualified Veterinarian as co-owner with Veterinarian Surgeon Siegfried Farnon, played by Robert Hardy, in the Yorkshire farming community of Darrowby during the late 1930's right before World War Two. Veterinary student & Siegfried's younger brother Tristan, played by Peter Davison continues to miss things up, but this time with the ladies & cooking. The housekeeper is Mrs. Hall, played by Mary Hignett, who leaves in a few episodes to care for relatives. James wife & part time secretary for the entire business is Helen played by Carol Drinkwater, who takes a second job to cover the bills.
Commentary: The third season continues where the second season left off where several of the characters ""Know"" what the other characters will do or say, & sometimes repeat per word at the same time. This correctly & naturally reveals the growing bond between everyone in the household. Most episodes deal with the upcoming war & how it affects their relationships & the farming community at large. This ends the 1st section of the series with Siegfried & James going off to war leaving Tristan to hold the business, & Helen returns to her father's house. As with the first & second seasons, this box set comes with 4 DVD's: at three to four 50 to 55 minute programs per DVD with an added bonus of a few commentaries by the main actors & a 5 minute short review on the James Herriot museum.
There are now two other DVD box sets, the first & second seasons, & a single DVD of 2 specials short in the mid 1980's. ""All Creatures Great & Small"" did return to British TV in the late 1980's with 4 seasons, but these are only on VHS at this time. A good buy if you're into real life comedy.",1074643200,22,2859,4.708582834331337
1359291,5,B00004W21X,"This series ""All Creatures Great and Small"" is special beyond a doubt. The Third season of episodes finds our friends concerned about the coming war and is contemplative about life changing soon among the dales. It is the most delightful of the 3 with wonderful flute music and genuinely funny plots that have Tristan taking over kitchen duties with his usual haplessness and we are also given another ""dose"" of Dr. Granville Bennett,a repeating character who constantly gets our heroes drunk. Another features a dog that is subject to ""gas"" straying into an afternoon tea party and stinks the place up while a stock character colonel is explaining the benefits of ""curry powder"" in the diet. Siegfried is distant at times and eventually reveals his feelings about the coming war to James. In the end, the obligations of duty summon them both while Tristan holds up the home vet practice (Finally passing his tests.)Things were never the same again after this season and for that and the reasons stated above I believe this to be the best. Well worth your time and investment. A sure tranquilizer for our hurried times.",1066003200,84,1119,4.894736842105263
1359292,5,B00004W21X,"I've never quite been able to pick a single best episode of ""All Creatures,"" my favorite TV series.  However, there are certainly several contenders for that honor in Series Three, the final series before James Herriot (Christopher Timothy) goes off to war.  The omnipresence of his impending departure makes this series kind of bittersweet, but fortunately the series came back in 1988 and ran through 1990 (with two Christmas specials and one full-length movie bridging the gap between the end of Series 3 and the beginning of series 4).
I hesitate to give away too much information about any of these episodes - they have to be seen! - but my personal favorites are ""Charity Begins At Home,"" ""If Wishes Were Horses,"" ""Be Prepared,"" ""A Dying Breed,"" ""Plenty To Grouse About,"" and ""Home and Away"".  As usual, the actors play their characters so convincingly that when reading Herriot's books it's impossible to imagine James, Siegfried, Tristan, etc. as anyone other than Christopher Timothy, Robert Hardy, and Peter Davison.
(One final note: after watching any given ACG&S episode with Mr. Davison in it - I admit I don't enjoy the ones without him quite as much - I can never help but consider the possibility that he may suffer from a hyperactive charm/appeal gland.)",1060214400,6,1271,4.957746478873239
1359293,5,B00004W21X,"If you are a fan of All Creatures Great and Small (ACGS), you will LOVE this newest release.  It simply is terrific.  Series III goes deeper, with both the characters and the storylines.  Relationships are explored and, against the background of 1939 WWII Britain, the thriving practice of Farnon and Herriot offers up loads of teats.  James and Helen anchor the show but certainly do not steal it.  James is the consummate professional and we see him develop into a true journeyman vet, with both mistakes and miracles mixed together.  His day at Grandville's  garden is priceless, and James's locum at the practice of Seigfried's pal, Stewie, sets up a ""colorful"" day at the dog races.  Siegfried falls in love, and exposes his heart in more ways than one.  Tristan comes into his own as a vet and a man, yet is still capable of the idiotic behavior we've come to love.  We even get to see a glimpse into the life of the stoic Mrs. Hall - her compassion as she reaches out to her family during a crisis; her steely countenance as she lurches about the pracitce following an afternoon of sherry drinking with her friends.  And once again, the delightfully quirky folk of the Yorkshire Dales provide a wealth of great storylines.  Vol III is a must-have for the ACGS fan.  It truly is like visiting with an old friend - no pretense and wonderfully encouraging.  Buy Vol III.  You won't be disappointed!",977356800,49,1402,4.642276422764228
1359294,5,B00004W21X,"Words fail me to express how I love this series... but heres some that fail, but hopefully only a bit.
I love this series, I really really do. This season continues the same level of high quality that we have become accustomed to. There is an additional depth to the relationships as they see the growing clouds of war that loom closer and closer through the stories. This brings about what is my favorite exchange between Sigfried and Tristan in the whole series. These really should be watched in order and I recommend setting some time aside, watching them all in one sitting isn't hard to do AT ALL! As for the stories... well Theres Bangers and Mash, the Belltower Ringers last Hurah, And you HAVE to buy it.... because if you dont, you will never see Grandvile's garden!! And that would be a pity... ""All the spices of the orient!"" These books/shows remind me of why I'm so thankfull for every day I'm on this earth.",973814400,19,922,4.526946107784431
1359295,5,B00004W21X,"For all of the faithful ACG&S fans another wonderful series. The first two volumes were great and the VHS quality superb. I would suspect that the  brisk sales in America has prompted the producers to bring out the third  volume. The first three are the best because they capture these wonderful  characters just before the start of WW2. I would also like to mention that  Jim Wight has written a wonderful book about his father called ""The  Real James Herriot"" (Ballantine Books) The relationships between the  actors and the ""real"" Herriot family is wonderful. Thanks Amazon  for telling me the good news. Hello VCR. I promise I won't watch them all  in one evening. ( Liar!)",966297600,64,677,4.775862068965517

Fillmed in the late 70's, part of the original series, the cast brilliantly creates the world of James Herriot, a new veterinarian in a tradition-bound rural setting so lovely it becomes one of the viewer's favorite places he or she has never visited, but would like to!

The heavy local dialect made the series sometimes difficult to follow when first broadcast, but the excellent closed captions make the new viewing more meaningful than the first. In time, regionalisms start to make sense, the accent more understandable since you can read what they say, too. I recommend it even if you don't have a hearing impairment.

But also at 82, I have read and seen a lot, and I can verify that Herriott is ""tops.""",1173312000,,309,3.769230769230769

1359400,5,B00004W21X,"All Creatures Great and Small was shown on PBS when our children were very young. After it was no longer aired, we really missed watching it. Now that we can purchase it on video/dvd, it's wonderful to be able watch all these episodes from the 70's and 80's. It is good, clean, wholesome viewing for children, grandchildren and adults - something that isn't always possible in today's world. Every year we have bought another series/season of the 45 minute shows. If you grew up watching Lassie, you won't want to miss All Creatures.",1125532800,5,533,4.741935483870968

7924434,1,B00004W21X,"The DVD Set of All Creatures Great & Small, Series 3 from RAREWAVES-IMPORTS, would not play on any of my DVD players or lap top.  I was NOT TOLD by RAREWAVES-IMPORTS that the DVD set was Region 2 and would NOT play on US machines BEFORE I purchased the set.  Only after the set arrived did I discover that it was Region 2 and would not play.  When I complained to seller, I was told to send the set to an address in Florida with a full written complaint.  If RAREWAVES-IMPORT is located in Florida, they should have known that DVDs have to be Region1 to play in the US.  I have purchased Series 1 and Series 2 from other companies in the USA and they are Region1 format and play perfectly.
  Beware of companies like RAREWAVES-IMPORTS, that don't warn you up front that you are buying Region 2 DVDs.",1502755200,2,799,4.286666666666667
