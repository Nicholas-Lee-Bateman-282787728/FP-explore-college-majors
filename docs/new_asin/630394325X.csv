741784,5,630394325X,"Well, I really don't think this miniseries was MEANT to be a ""family entertainment"" type deal (if that's what you're looking for, try the Disney aisle).  I was never really a big fan of Edith Wharton, but I am  absolutely in love with this production and have seen it several times.  Unlike our friend from Maryland, I don't believe that these girls cared not  for consequence; rather, like many young women of their time, they married  blindly and naively, and storyline deals with how each of the heroines  survives her chosen path.",949968000,2,534,4.75
741785,5,630394325X,"This movie will appeal to those who enjoy Jane Austen productions like Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensability.  It is set mostly in England of the late 1800's/early 1900's among the aristocracy, tracing the plight  of four ""noveau riche"" American girls.  The movie opens in  America where the girls are scorned by the old money for being new money,  so they head off to England for a ""London Season"".  The hope is  that after spending a few months in the esteemed society of the English  nobility, the New York aristocracy would have no choice but to accept the  girls and their families into NY high society.  In England however, things  do not go as planned.
Unlike Jane Austen's movies, where the girls always  make good marriages in the end, and the bad marriages are always portrayed  in a comical way, The Buccaneers portrays events in a much darker, more  realistic way.  The aristocracy (which at this point in history is  suffering, financially) is preying on the young women for their money, and  the young women, some of them, as stalking the men for their titles.  Most  marriages are not made for love, and even in those that are, there is a  price to be paid to maintain respectability.  With main characters also  including a governess, a high-priced mistress, and an un-married  matchmkater, this movie also explores the alternatives for women who didn't  wish to marry, and the very stiff consequences facing a woman who wished to  be free.
This is a beautiful, provocative movie.",946512000,17,1503,4.8
741786,5,630394325X,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I love the girls' search of social respectibility and their struggle with love and loss, and finally their discovery of their true selves.  The costumes and scenery are  breathtaking.  I have probably seen this movie 10 times and can almost  recite it line by line.  I only wish that Edith Wharton had been able to  finish the novel before she died so that an accurate ending could have been  written for the film.  A perfect movie for a rainy day and a pot of tea.  Absolutely Marvelous!",942969600,7,538,4.3979591836734695

741869,1,630394325X,"I disliked so many things about this miniseries.
The overall problem is SO much sadness.
It was depressing to see 4 out of 5 women end up in loveless marriages.
The whole story is about the loss of innocence & the stupidity of the English way of marrying for title & money
I was hard pressed to find any English character that I did like.
SO breaking it down
1) Mia Sorvino as Brazilian doesn't work. not with the accent, not with her fair skin. You need to suspend all disbelief in order to see her as a passionate & hot blooded.
2) An American character learns on her wedding day that she has been married solely for her money pretty much before shes' left the church so why not slap the guys face & get an annulment ?
3) It seems a 2 year engagement is not uncommon, so why doesn't one character simply take advantage of that option before leaving (for 2 years ) to make his fortune ?
4) marital rape:  Outwardly sweet & kind a tightly buttoned up Englishman's lack of knowledge & inexperience with women makes him insecure to the point of violence.  It really was awful, as is every time after that he seeks out his wife for intimacy
5) Husband give his wife her space & turns to homosexuality
7)The happy ending isn't  :to commit adultery, get pregnant & run off with your lover....not romantic, not a happy ending.",1484265600,2,1320,4.357723577235772

741871,4,630394325X,"I like period pieces like this movie. It was a dark story of what it was like to be a female of means who was looking for love. A woman could not really trust the intentions of those aristocrats who were in need of money to maintain their large estates and their unproductive lifestyle. Marrying a titled man was not necessarily a good thing for many of the young women. It was also a story of what it was like to be an independent unmarried woman who kept a broke aristocratic lover or who strove to find employment and stay above scandal. Women paid the price no matter if they married or if they didn't. I liked the movie but I didn't like the skipping that occurred in the second chapter. I had the closed captioning on to try to ascertain what might be the gist of the conversation in the scenes since there was a lot of skipping of the DVD. Thankfully, it didn't skip again in the rest of the chapters. The cast of characters were very realistic for the time period.",1481673600,,972,4.288043478260869

741937,5,630394325X,Love this movie. The time period is pre Downton Abbey. A time when the British aristocracy was first beginning to see their fortunes erode and estates threatened with ruin.

742041,3,630394325X,"I love period dramas. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. Overall, I found this adaptation of Edith Wharton's book of the same name to be rather mediocre.

The story starts off in the United States in the 1870s where four young women, two of whom are sisters, are interested in meeting prospective suitable husbands. Unfortunately, they are ostracized by polite society as they are thought to be nouveaux rich. When one of them manages to snag a visiting English Lord and marries him, the other three are galvanized into going to England to test the waters there. While in England, they meet their future husbands, but all is not as it initially appears to be.

While the production values and costumes are excellent, the script falters and the acting, while good for the most part,  has some issues. In particular, Mira Sorvino's character, that of Conchita, the supposed Brazilian heiress who turned out to be practically penniless, seems more like a parody. Moreover, direction appears to be lacking throughout. Still, those who enjoy period dramas will get a modicum of enjoyment from this mini series.",1453680000,,1111,4.962365591397849

742174,4,630394325X,"This seller exceeded my expectation by delivering  this product to me earlier than what was stated. I will use this seller again.

When this series first aired (in the U.S.) it was my first introduction to Edith Wharton, English & American aristocracy as a whole, and the guilded age. I had to know more about it; so much so, that I purchased a book: ""What Jane Austen Ate, and What Charles Dickens Knew"" which explained terms, phrases, and daily English life in the 19th century. At 24 yrs old then, it was a world I knew nothing about prior to watching the Buccaneers. Thank goodness for PBS, Masterpiece Theater, and the BBC. I would have given this DVD ""5"" stars if only I had a ""heads-up"" about the alternate ending on this DVD, as well as other deleted scenes. At the very least, the deleted scenes should have been included in the commentary, or ""behind the scenes"" segment. This ending was not what originally aired. Although I was expecting to see Nan run off with Guy Thwaite, this version left my mouth agape, and me quite in shock. At 24 years old, the original ending made more sense to me wayyyy back then. Now that I'm muuuch older, I appreciate this ending even more, as it shows a touch more realism to which Nan has chosen to abandon the thought of a happy marriage, and to accept her position, as so many women were forced to do back then.",1431216000,3,1358,4.449799196787149

Each of the women is carefully drawn as an individual person, and each story is different. But the common experience of adjusting to regimented life in late 19th Century England after growing up wealthy in the booming U.S. draws them together even more than their family relations and friendships. But this is also the story of British families of several classes during that same period. Not only is it a good yarn; it's lushly produced with authentic settings, gorgeous costuming, and everything else that draws the eye and ear.

Is this the greatest movie ever?  Nope.  But is it entertaining?  Certainly.  Like a book you lose yourself in during vacation, not for intellectual stimulation or thought-provoking conversation, but just to be lost in a story with little value other than being a good story.  I hardly want to read ""War and Peace"" on the beach during my vacation... this is the easy romance novel you pick up just to check out of reality for awhile and then be done with it.  Not bad, considering it was an unfinished novel and it had to be pieced together.  The acting is top notch, and the costuming is simply amazing.

There are several plot changes and some very unanticipated changes in character development. Warning: there are some themes of rape, abortion, and partner violence in the series.

I love a look into the social morays and culture of the time period.  More than once I found myself glad to be an independent woman now rather than then.  The gowns were lovely, but I would hate to trade in my jeans for all the flounces and corsets. I love the architecture and furnishings.  The plot of the story is shallow...how to get the main family accepted into the social network of New York.  The dual underlying plot seems to be getting the girls married off well.

I won't spoil any of the story for you, but set in a slightly earlier period in time, it shows what life could be like with a completely different experience.

There's a helpful bit of ""recap-introduction"" narration at the beginning of subsequent episodes, as told from the perspective of the ""Laura"" character. I thought the story moved along quite nicely; roller-coaster fashion, of course; but with turns that were both satisfying and unsettling. Does it ultimately have a happy ending? It might; watch The Buccaneers and find out!

743183,2,630394325X,"i am usually totally enthralled with any BBC period piece. i thought this adaptation of edith wharton's book would surely please me, but unfortunately i was wrong.

while i did enjoy the setting in england, and the costumes for the most part, that was the best part of the mini-series by far. cherie lunghi shines, but many of the other actors were not at their best. usually i like carla guiliani (sorry i know i misspelled that) very much, but i feel like she (along the other buccaneers) was terribly miscast. her character is supposed to be young, immature, juvenile but it comes off as forced because carla is too old even in 1995 to pass for a teenager. seriously, what were they thinking? they should have cast a teenager and it would have been much more believable. no amount of giddy giggling and running amok could make these women pass off as young as they supposedly were. which by the way, as others noted, their actions and personalities were at times very annoying and i found it hard to believe that even the carefree americans that they were would have behaved that way in that time. and the st. georges are supposedly rich, i know they are nouveu riche, but still, they came across as without an ounce of class...no wonder the old money of new jersey wanted nothing to do with them. they were obnoxious. the mother was the worst, she was so over the top.

the acting is pretty shallow for the main characters, so i found it difficult to engage with them or really care what was happening, even though i usually loooove this time and place. then the plot starts jumping around without explanation, and it is difficult to decide why the girls made such poor decisions in marriage and even more difficult to feel any sympathy for them because they are so stupid. then things get so awful....i know it's not a feel good movie, but geez it left me feeling kind of nauseous and wishing i had never watched this. and i am not a prude, i just wished some of the characters had redeeming qualities, but really they were all so shallow and pathetic, you don't get to liking any of them.

this is not on par with usual BBC period pieces, not at all. i think it was a waste of my time, frankly. i would still like to check out the book, because i can see how the book was probably much, much better than this shallow soap opera rendition.  i just wanted to warn people it is not as good as other BBC movies/miniseries. if you are really into edith wharton, or the late 19th century, and still want to check it out, it may be okay for you; but don't expect it to knock your socks off.

743654,4,630394325X,"""The Buccanneers"" is based on Edith Wharton's last and unfinished novel, a story of rich American girls marrying English aristocracy. As in any arrangement of a marriage, where love is not the primary motivation, there are trade-offs. In some cases, the trade-offs are too enormous to handle; Duchess Annabelle is really in love with another man, and her immaturity and willfulness lead her to create a scandal.

This series is beautifully cast and acted; the sets are magnificent as are the costumes. In particular, I enjoyed Jenny Agutter, Mira Sorvino and Cherie Lunghi. (Agutter plays the cast-off mistress of Lord Brightlingsea. Her depiction of depression is spot-on. She's rarely dressed in more than a negligee or housecoat, she reclines languidly on any couch or hammock, drinks to excess.)

The problem I have with some of the script is that Duke Julius is supposed to be kind of a dud (sexually ambiguous) but he is written with so much sympathy, along with the Dowager Duchess (his mother), who patiently tries to explain the duties of a duchess to Annabelle, that instead of feeling sorry for Annabelle, I felt more sorry for her husband and mother-in-law, who got a woman who just didn't want to play the game she signed up for (kind of a Princess Diana, in a way.) I think Annabelle was not given enough to make her seem more than a spoiled little girl who tantrums when things are not a fairytale.

The five episodes tell the story, but somehow I wanted more. Is that because the book itself was finished after Wharton's death? Or is it that this series is somewhat lacking? I enjoyed it, but I wanted a bit more.",1378339200,,1629,4.749116607773852

743745,4,630394325X,"Edith Wharton adored beauty and order and the teetering sense that she lived in a time of great destruction and rebirth. Her greatness, to those of us who cannot get enough of her work, is that she neither manipulates nor preaches- but merely lays tender tales that prove that the conflict that preoccupies modern man simply is and that the human heart plays the part of arbiter.

This presentation can boast gorgeous scenery, fashion and bling.  For that alone, it is worth watching.  The characters are portrayed with the restrained exceptional truth of a good ensemble performance with adherence to the nature of the times.  American and British differences are again portrayed with restraint and subtlety.  No point is driven home too intensely.

On the whole, however, the series fails to earn 5 stars, at least from this reviewer as at times it was a bit soap operaish- which, tho I read the book years ago I imagine if I re-read it I'd feel much the same.

 A worthwhile watch, Mrs. Wharton  never fails to keep her reader and observers longing for more of this tale, this chapter, this scene and the adaptation proves itself worthy of her signature.",1376524800,,1157,4.773869346733668

Rich in detail, the clothing and hairstyles made you feel like you were right there at the moment.  The story showed how the aristocracy of that era had to scramble to maintain their lifestyles, at a time when the gap between the classes was undergoing drastic change. In order to maintain a proper gentlemans life one had to marry well.  Yet, if you were a ""lady"" at that time, you needed to marry well in order to maintain your lifestyle.  But what happens when neither one has any money?  Also, if you were not born into aristocracy, there was no way to ever become one.  This series had some political statements that addressed this problem, by addressing how one gained entrance into the House of Lords.  I recommend this one as a drama that has some historical basis to it.

744230,1,630394325X,"I was excited to watch this movie series.  I had never read the book it was based on, and the majority of the reviews were good, but upon watching this movie I thought otherwise.  I could look past the more fuzzy kind of film they used had the story been decent, but DECENT is probably not a word that should EVER be applied to this story!
I love period dramas, and have watched many of them, and so I bought this one in hopes of having another favorite.  But now I wish I hadn't wasted the time or money on this movie!
First off, the story had promise...at the beginning.  Four rich American girls sent over to Europe in hopes of snagging a titled bachelor sounded like the making of an interesting story.  But as the girls soon discover, things are not always what they seem.
SPOILERS:
The lively Spanish beauty, Conchita, snags the first man on their arrival, in whom after a couple years of marriage she eventually loses interest in.  He contracts a decease after having his many affairs, and in recompense she begins to have an affair of her own.
Our main heroine, Nan, sets her fancy for a certain young man who leaves for 2 years, but rather than wait for him, she marries a Duke, who on first appearances seemed to be a nice guy that she could get along with, until we learn that he is sometimes abusive, neglectful, and secretly homosexual (Jane Austen say what?!?!)
The heroine's sister, Virginia, doesn't fair any better, marrying a man (Conchita's brother-in-law) who is only interested in her for her money, in which he promptly tells her only minutes after their nuptials.
Only Lizzy, whom they hardly feature in the story at all, has made a good match, by choosing a hard working business man, rather than one with a title, and seems to be the only one who can be truly happy with her life choices in the end.
After everyone is sufficiently married off Nan's original love interest comes to town and carries her away in front of everyone at a large party.  Of course she is then divorced by the Duke and goes away with her true love that she was too stupid not to even wait for in the first place.  She gains the love of her man, but in the process ruins her reputation, is shunned by her sister and friends, and is pretty much cut off from everyone she once knew just because, quite frankly, she was an idiot.  I can hardly enjoy a story line when in the end I think the heroine gets what she deserves (in a bad way), and I care nothing about her.

CONCLUSION:
Just as I would advise our ""Buccaneer"" ladies to not leave home in the first place, I would advise you to not let your money leave your pocket on this one.",1352937600,10,2632,4.3640081799591
744231,4,630394325X,"My review of 'The Buccaneers"" is confined to the screen production as I've not read Edith Wharton's unfinished novel of the the same name. Some of Wharton's works have been successfully adapted for the big screen such as The Age of Innocence [with Daniel Day Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer] and The House of Mirth [with Gillian Anderson]. In The Buccaneers, we follow the adventures of a group of nouveau riche aka ""New Rich"" American girls - sisters Annabelle/Nan[ Carla Gugino] and Virginia St James [Alison Elliott], Lizzy Elmsworth[Rya Kihlstedt], and Conchita Closson [Mira Sorvino]. Since their New Rich status bars them entry into the Old Rich high society of new York, they go off to England in search of well-connected husbands.

The girls attract the attention of men of the English nobility who in some instances, have only prestigious titles to their names and not much else. All the girls get married but with the exception of Lizzy who makes a stable and happy marriage, the others end up being miserable with their choice of husbands. Conchita [Mira Sorvino] marries Lord Richard, a weak-willed alcoholic, Virginia marries Richard's brother Lord Seadown [Mark Tandy] who marries her only for her money, for he has a long-standing affair with an older woman [Jenny Agutter], and free-spirited Nan [Carla Gugino] settles for the Duke of Trevenick, though her heart belongs to Guy Thwaite [Greg Wise aka Mr Willoughby of Sense & Sensibility].

""The Buccaneers"" is at heart the story of Nan, and her fight for the right to be her own person despite a calamitous marriage, and the restrictions that her position as Duchess of Trevenick imposes upon her. Carla Gugino shines in her role, and her transformation from an idealistic teenager into a mature, young woman who learns to deal with the harsh realities of life is very credibly done. The other noteworthy performance is of Nan's governess, Ms Test Valley[Cheri Lunghi], who portrays a woman who has had to fend for herself by working as a governess since she was 17, and at the age of 40, finds herself bemoaning the fate of women during her time, the inability to live their own lives the way they deem fit, and to not have the choice of loving whom they please.

In conclusion, this is a well-made period drama that will appeal to fans of the genre, and has lush landscapes, not to mention sumptuous costumes and of course, fine acting by an ensemble cast.",1351900800,,2421,4.857142857142857

But she elevates this miniseries to another level. If she hadn't been in this, I would give it 2 stars at best. The girl has some chops, and has never been given the one role that would make her a bonafide superstar. She's quietly and subtly great in everything she does, which is a talent in itself. But in this miniseries, she is able to convey every motion, from delight to despair all within the nuances of her eyes and demeanor. Beautiful work. She elevates every scene she is in and makes what would be mediocre superb. Still, its a decent production and it is entertaining.

I enjoyed the first third of the miniseries, but the rest was absolute rubbish. I only watched it to the end out of morbid curiosity. Why they veered so far away from the novel is beyond me, as I found the novel to be very interesting, and the plot riveting. I couldn't wait to read how it ended. There was no need to make so many plot changes--the original was superb and I thought it would make great movie fodder. Anyone who watched this without reading the book and hated it, please read the book. You'll like it so much more!

There were so many things added to this that were unnecessary--rape, abortion, homosexuality, etc.

The story move quickly and I wished they'd spent more time flushing out certain plot lines, but the overall story is very clear. The actors chosen fit the parts well and make the characters very emotionally accessible.

744337,4,630394325X,"This is an entertaining film with impressive settings and costumes. The acting is well done and there are some outstanding performances. However, there are a few flaws that bear mentioning. This review starts with the positives, the cast, and then ends with the negative, primarily a screen play that diverts too much from the intentions of Edith Wharton.

Carla Gugino, from the film Watchmen, and Alison Elliott, from the film Wings of the Dove, play the St. George sisters - the characters around which the entire film revolves. Alison Elliott is an incredible beauty. Their adolescent friends are Conchita Closson, played by Mira Sorvino, and Lizzy Elmsworth, played by Rya Kihlstedt.  These young women have fates that rise and fall as the leave America and seek social status in England. The film seeks to show the girls as silly playmates, innocent and naive, But the actresses are too mature for the yard games these girls play in the first quarter of the film.

There are three outstanding performances from other actions including Cherie Lunghi as governess Laura Testvalley, Greg Wise as Guy Thwaite, and James Frain as Julius Folyat. Frain was familiar to me as the sadistic vampire Franklin Mott in True Blood and his acting range is outstanding. Greg Wise is so pretty he competes with the beautiful actresses in the film.

The film diverts from Edith Wharton's bleak and realistic view of money's ability to corrupt and social consequences for independent actions and thought. The screen play seems to have decreased the intensity of the consequences for the bad choices some of these young women make. It is an entertaining film but it does not capture Wharton's astute insights into the restrictions of society upon women and the consequences for poor decisions.",1343260800,3,1779,5.040816326530612
744338,4,630394325X,"Based on Edith Wharton's final uncompleted novel, THE BUCCANEERS is one of the most popular BBC miniseries.  An ambitious British/American coproduction, this 1995 miniseries sadly cuts down on the characters depicted in the original novel, but finally provides the conclusion which (though not written by the author herself) I'm sure Wharton would have approved.

The term ""Buccaneers"" was given to the American heiresses who travelled to England in the late 19th Century with hopes of marrying into the British aristocracy.  Precious few of these marriages were true ""love matches"", and in most cases the men were mostly interested in investing their wives' considerable allowances into propping up their own dwindling fortunes and crumbling estates.  Our story concerns four such ""Buccaneers"".

The St. George sisters Nan (Carla Gugino), Virginia (Alison Elliott) and their two best friends Lizzy Elmsworth (Rya Kihlstedt) and Conchita Closson (Mira Sorvino) are all vivacious young heiresses in America, full of adventure and daring, but encountering difficulties in meeting eligible young men.  When Nan's new British governess Miss Laura Testvalley (Cherie Lunghi) suggests to the St. George's that their girls would greatly benefit from a trip to England and a chance to experience their first London ""Season"", the family sets sail on what will turn out to be a trip which will alter the lives of all concerned.

Brazilian firecracker Conchita is the first to claim victory when she nabs notorious rake Lord Richard Marabel (Ronan Vibert), and Virginia follows suit when she charms her way into the same family and marries Lord Seadown (Mark Tandy), despite the presence of his long-standing mistress Idina Hatton (Jenny Agutter).  But it's Nan who makes the biggest splash when she is swept off her feet by Julius Folyat, the Duke of Trevennick (James Frain).  Blithely believing that she is about to step into her own real-life fairytale and despite the protestations of Miss Testvalley that she's not ready to settle down after just one romance, Nan's impulsive marriage rapidly turns into a nightmare when she discovers the true nature of her husband, less than equipped to be the man of her dreams, and a household where she is treated more like some treasured china doll than a wife.  Nan is not-too-subtly loved from afar by Julius' friend, politician Guy Thwaite (Greg Wise), but how can their love survive in a time when money and property are valued over everything else?

THE BUCCANEERS was Edith Wharton's stinging indictment on the American upper-classes to which she belonged but was vocally critical of.  In the story, the girls' single-minded quests for station and titles bring them nothing but unhappiness, as their husbands reign in their desires and take away any possible freedom.  Just like in real life, there are few 'happy' endings, but the drama along the way will prove addictive viewing for lovers of this kind of lush, plush period drama.

This DVD presents the miniseries as it originally aired (5 episodes), although there is also a Dutch DVD edition (fully licensed from the BBC) which has re-edited the series into 6 episodes.",1341446400,6,3165,5.180392156862745

It is a costume drama but the iffy costumes don't make up for what seems like a bunch of girls playing at pretending to be naive American girls from the late 19th Century.  As if me and my friends at 13 decided to act out our favorite period piece.  Mira Sorvino is an atrocity with her made up ""Brazilian"" accent that sounds more slavic than romantic - which alone ceases the fantasy within 5 minutes of the first episode and continues to irritate throughout.  I may be impartial because I've always thought she was a hack that got lucky when she was cast in Mighty Aphrodite.  The only character mildly charming is the one Carla Guingino plays but it is still ruined by bad directing.  Its difficult to root for any character because they're all 2 dimensional caricatures.  The premise of four young women leaving a close-minded New England society to experience the excitement of Europe turns into a lame soap-opera, (but even All My Children is better than this!) expect lines like ""You mean you married me for my money?!"" with dramatic pauses on close-ups of horrified faces.

Those reasons will all apply here except maybe the ability of some soap operas to draw you into the characters to a point that you really want to know what will happen to them. This movie does not do that, yet it shares all of the other negative qualities of a soap opera. Read other one star reviews if you still think this may be worth your time & money. I generally read reviews, but did not take the time to do so for this movie. The reason it was recommended & the rating tempted me, & when the price was shown as so much lower than the retail, I foolishly thought it was worth the risk. So many upsetting & depressing elements, scenes & messages in this movie have pushed me to make what is probably not a very helpful review, since it lacks specifics, but I wanted to at least put a little effort towards sparing others the experience & aftereffects of this depressing movie.",1324857600,4,1421,4.345864661654136
744478,2,630394325X,"What a totally depressing representation of marriage. I have never read the book and did not know what to expect, but the movie sounded interesting, as I find period pieces enjoyable. The first couple of hours were not terrible and actually drew me in, but then the main characters got married and everything went downhill quick! Marriage, as protrayed in this movie, is a horrible, dreadful thing where the men never stop their side affairs and the wives are forced to find lovers. One man tells his wife, on their wedding day, mind you, he only married her for her money. The other is a homosexual, who we discreetly find out about when the horse groomer gives him a flirty wink, and then we find out in whole, when they are discovered wrapped in each others arms, sleeping in bed (with smiles on their faces). Nan is the unfortunate married to this fellow. But what is quite hard to understand is why Julius (her husband) pursued her so ardently in the first place if his feelings are for men. Second, is why Nan had such fun with Julius before she married him, and then when he wants to sleep with her, she shrieks and crys. What happened to change her feelings? No explanation. She goes completely cold on him after that and seeks out the man she would have married if he hadn't left for a job in a faraway country, but now has returned. The few characters in this movie who seem to think marriage is for life, and that if both husband and wife would put aside selfishness and try to please the other - a good marriage is possible, are made to look loony. Basically this is a movie that shouts if you're not happy, find a way to make it happen. The whole second half of the film was like a bad soap opera and for this reason, I'd say skip this movie if you put any value in marriage.",1324425600,4,1788,4.3562874251497

If a buccaneer's bark had this many holes, it would sink before ever broaching the high seas.  The script for this mini-series is so leaky that viewers may well discover difficulty in navigating the storyline.  They most assuredly must wonder at characters' rash actions, given that little or no motivational ballast is provided for so many of their abrupt and senseless decisions.  Worse, the plot consistently lurches from one pivotal event to the next, depriving the audience of empathetic anxiety and suspense.  Much of the presentation is like a tableau in which a sequence of scenes is splashed before the viewers' gaze.  One thus learns that a character did this or that, but not why.  Indeed, character development is all but nonexistent.  A viewer's head might initially swim in struggling to even differentiate one buccaneer from the next, as the girls spend more time giggling and spinning about than enriching the audience with knowledge of their personalities.  When someone in the story does something unusual, the audience is simply left at sea as to incentive.  An English noble weds an American with whom he shares a genuine friendship and affection.  Then it's made known that he has failed to consummate the marriage.  He playfully ravishes his wife.  She seems satisfied.  Then she spurns him.  He tries to bribe her into bed.  Then he beds a man.  All this occurs without any narrational evolution or elucidation.

The acting is pathetically bad - exaggerated stereotypes, outright silliness and a several characters that seem like they are on are the verge of insanity. I kept expecting it to devolve into a Monty Python sketch. I can't believe the woman who played Mrs. St George ever got hired for another role.

Aside from the terrible, awful acting, dreadful and annoying laughter, the screenplay eliminates the fifth Buccaneer - key to a crucial political twist later in the novel.

The addition of closeted abortion, syphilis, homosexuality and marital rape is heavy-handed and excessively 20th century - completely changing the reasons for Annabelle's dissatisfaction with her new wifely role/duties into something that modern American audiences would find horrifying.

So many roles were mis-cast - Mira Sorvino as Conchita was one of the biggest - she was a fair auburn/red-head in the book. Changing the name of Tintagel to Trevenick was confusing - but the Duke was described as pretty much the opposite in appearance as the actor who portrayed him.

Edith Whartan's unfinished novel comes to life in the beautifully dressed five hour series about four American women trying to find fortune, fame, and happiness with the declining English aristocracy.  The tale is narrated by the faithful, well wishing, free but lonely, governess(Cherie Lunghi) of the two sisters from the the group of ""buccaneers"".

Indeed, this is one of the most pretty costume pieces one will ever see: incredible dresses and hairdos, amazing homes and countrysides, most of it filmed in England.  Each shot captures some mood or romantic longing.  Impressive.

The director, Philip Saville(The Gospel of John) does a fine job with so many interlacing storylines going on, and the actors, for the most part, do quite well.  Carla Gugino carries the brunt of the work and the abuse as the young, naive but soon to mature debutante.  Jenny Agutter is great as an aging, tortured, long suffering mistress.  James Frain(The Count of Monte Cristo) as the creepy Duke after the affections of the vulnerable sister, Gugino's character.

My issue with this film is the writing which vacillates between superb, five star stuff to ugh!, ""I can't believe how dumb!"" , at times quite painfully so. I kept asking myself, ""Why?""

There's no frank nudity or severe language; however, there are very adult themes of abuse, rape, deceitfulness, disease, homosexuality, sleeping around and general tomfoolery.  Nothing's shown for gratuity's sake.

They tie it all together nicely at the end with some happiness provided.  Whew!  It's interesting.  I'd say watch at least the first full episode or so before deciding on whether it's your cup of tea, so to speak, or not.  After adding up all the factors, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.",1311379200,,1889,5.003205128205129
744591,4,630394325X,"Edith Wharton was not only an author, she also was a member of New York's high society. And her books reflected her knowledge of how that society lived. Unfortunately, she passed away before completing this novel, but this mini-series has been adapted per the notes she left behind. Edith Wharton was not Jane Austen. Her novels present more true to life situations and are peopled with individuals who are more realistic.

In ""The Bucaneers,"" four young ladies whose families are attempting to break into high society are not achieving the success their families had hoped for: courtship and marriages with the best of society. In desperation, Mrs. St. George (mother to 2 of the girls - Virginia and Nan) send her daughters to England in hopes of securing their position in society and possibily making good marriages there. One of the 4 girls, Conchita Closson, does manage to marry an British aristocrat. The final girl, Lizzy Elmsworth, eventually ends up in England.

The mini-series revolves around the girls experience with courtship and ultimate marriages, and the fact of what must be dealt with when one marries for social position instead of love. And how they eventually because part of that upper society their families had always wanted for them - and at what sacrifice.

There was a time when women had few choices in life, and to go against those choices was to be ostracized and abandoned by friends and family. It wasn't merely a decision whether to be happy - it was decision of survival. And this story shows that very well. It is said that Ms. Wharton used Consuelo Vanderbilt as her inspiration for Conchita Closson, and Lady Randolph Churchill as her inspiration for Lizzy Elmsworth. Who knows?

This story is not all rainbows and butterflies. But it allows the viewer to think on where women have been, and where they have come, and if they would have made the same decisions had they been in the same situation.

The acting is a little bit to be desired, but overall, the scenery, the costumes, and the storyline are wonderful. Would recommend as a rental, not a purchase.",1310342400,3,2098,4.832869080779944

They become upset when the stupid decisions, of all but one of them, to marry, culturally and in every conceivable way, unsuitable partners and, like today's American women, of course it is everyone's fault but their own when things go awry.

This one starts in the U.S., post Civil War, and moves to England. I feel the later stages of the movie may be a bit of emotional let down for some viewers.

744670,3,630394325X,"I enjoyed this production.  The acting is high quality - Mira Sorvino's performance is exceptionally so; also Cherie Lunghi and Jenny Agutter's, and Connie Booth in a smaller supporting turn.  Michael Kitchen and Greg Wise are excellent as the outsider-Englishman and his ambitious son - the son who won't conform to his father's dreams.

I thought the screenwriters kept a great deal of accuracy in the depiction of how American heiresses were married off into British aristocratic society - and how they were treated, afterward.  In other words, the American girl's money was warmly welcomed, but the girl was someone to be patronized as an ""American mongrel"" by her mother- and sister-in-laws; at least, until she produced an heir and a spare, and perhaps gained a little power over her life thereby.  The writing here might not be strictly Wharton-by-the-book (and THE BUCCANEERS is something of a mongrel Wharton anyway, having been finished by another author), but Wharton based these particular young women and their lives on real people (such as Jennie Jerome and Consuelo, Duchess of Manchester), and that genuine true-life detail and quality has been kept.  The attitude of the Duchess (Nan's mother-in-law) toward Nan, and all of Nan's difficulties and emotions, are exactly right, and yet the Duchess's backstory, when we learn it, makes us pity her too - briefly.  It's skillful, and enjoyable, when ALL the characters, even the less instantly sympathetic ones, are created with a touch of understanding and pity.

My problem with the production is a kind of abruptness that occurs too frequently.  Scenes end suddenly, and aren't followed up (for example, Julius makes a marriage proposal to Nan - and in the next scene they're married & returning from their honeymoon).  Lizzie Ellsworth's marriage isn't given as full a treatment as the other 'Buccaneers', which disappointed me.  She marries an interesting character - Hector Robinson, the non-genteel, social-climbing MP, but their relationship is given short shrift.  The viewer is given more in-depth regarding Conchita's and Virginia's marriages, but there again, there is stop/start abruptness and gaps in their stories.  Really the only Buccaneer I could say we get to ""know"" is Nan St. George, because her marriage is given the fullest attention; especially the last two episodes.  I liked knowing all about Nan, but I also wanted more about the others.

While THE BUCCANEERS doesn't have the directorial smoothness and narrative flow of most BBC adaptations, the story isn't boring (as some reviewers have said).  It's strange to me how anyone who purchased this DVD (and presumably, read something about its content first) could expect a sparkling-sunny Jane Austen-style adaptation, such as that it shall be nameless Regency tale where a handsome rich man marries a pretty, witty poor girl with four sisters, and all the loose ends are tied up in the end.  Even though the Bennett sisters had to marry money, there was a lightness about their search for married happiness.  THE BUCCANEERS is grittier - it's mid-Victorian England, and the beginning of the end for the aristocratic landed class (something that only Hector Robinson sees, even as he aspires to join it).  The real-life aristocratic landowners wanted money to keep up their way of life; American heiresses had the money, and many were married off without love for the sake of a title.  Many of the fictional British characters portrayed here are craven; are users; are manipulative and unattractive.  The young and naive Americans had to toughen up and adapt to British aristocratic ways, as Virginia and Conchita do - or not, in the case of Nan.  This story struck me as an accurate representation of what happened to many rich young American women, at least from what I've read about 19th century Anglo-American marriages.

I have to respond to those reviewers who complained about how these women lacked 'gumption', or said that they sat around 'whining' about their fates.  Anyone who watches this DVD should remember that in this time period, even wealthy young women weren't well educated (only by a governess, if she was lucky) and were raised with the view that marriage was their only future.  A woman became a man's property upon marriage, with her money belonging solely to him.  (If she was lucky, as Jennie Jerome was, her American father might insist on at least a part of it remaining in her control.  But that didn't happen often.)  One also has to remember that they barely knew their husbands, let alone that marrying a British Lord would entail sacrificing their American heritage and citizenship to take on a British one, and taking on a totally unknown, cliquish-aristocratic territory at that.

But the bottom line is, if I personally had it to do over again, I probably wouldn't buy the DVD, but would borrow it from the local library.  Although it's a good story, and occasionally a very good, and always well-acted story, it's not quite a keeper, due to the somewhat choppy way the multi-narrative was handled.",1301875200,4,5076,5.0588235294117645

In the latter half of the 1800's, America's New York was a rising industrial and financial giant. Many ""old money"" families like the Vanderbilt's and Astor's began to look to England to secure English titles to add to their prestige. Whereas, the ""new moneyed"" Americans denied admittance into New York society, also looked to England for a title and acceptance. On the other hand, where England was still a colonial power with extreme amounts of wealth in the hands of a few landed gentry, many of these landed English families were cash poor; thus paving the way for marriage alliances to be formed across the Atlantic.

The Story:
Edith Wharton's unfinished novel, The Buccaneers takes place within these historical times, and portrays the hazards that develop when socially driven families manipulate and connive young minds through the use of duty, honor, title and wealth.

This BBC production is splendidly done, with grand costumes of the day, beautiful locations, and strong performances by the cast. One slight drawback is that several key characters seem to simply fade away within the story, so that the emotional investment is oddly lost and dismissed for three of the four girls halfway through the series.

The ending developed from Wharton's notes is satisfying, at the same time that it is unsettling. For true to the time, women's choices were difficult, and often crushing. Surprisingly, you may find that you'll think on this story long afterwards.",1280707200,,1478,5.124481327800829

744864,4,630394325X,"This is not a 'happily-ever-after' kind of a story. The plot is convoluted. Cinderella is nowhere to be seen. Moral values are few and hard to find, and just when you think you've found someone who has brains and/or morals, if that's your goal, the plot takes another turn. It's an attractive movie as far as backgrounds and clothes.

I watched this several years ago and forgot that I had watched it, which says something, and started it again. After several false starts, losing interest and starting again, I made it through to the end, and came out with some 'lessons' that this series teaches.

-America is different from England, as if we didn't already know that, but I hadn't realized just how different we really are/were.

-English 'gentlemen' don't work.

-English 'gentleman' often have LAND but NO MONEY. They must marry rich or lose the land.

-English 'gentleman' are willing to marry for money and find their love elsewhere.

-English 'gentleman' are not always very nice and sometimes downright cruel to their wives.

-It is frowned upon when an English gentleman decides that he wants to earn a living, just not done! It's also frowned upon when they want to marry outside their position in life.

-Americans don't have a clue how the English system works, but it sounds/looks like fun, so we want to participate in it, and if we have the money for it, they will let us do it.

-American women in the 1800s had no rights, were treated like children, and in some cases were downright silly, probably because they were expected to be. It certainly didn't pay for them to have brains, or values not appreciated by their families, and try to use them.

I tried very hard to find characters that I could relate to or care about. Finally I found one and hoped she would continue behaving herself appropriately through the whole story. How did that turn out? You'll have to see it and decide for yourself.",1272758400,,1916,4.692537313432836

Some people may view the last hour of the mini-series as over-the-top, but as a lover of romance, I find it to be one of the most emotionally satisfying hours of film I have ever seen, guaranteed to generate many weeks of romantic fantasy. Nan's marriage to the Duke, although painful, is also presented very well.

Not a movie you would enjoy watching with your daughter, grandaughter (or even your husband, for that matter), it's right up there with Another World.

I was fully prepared to ignore the visual issues with this otherwise sumpteous production except that the story line was a deep disappointment. I've read many other Edith Wharton novels and found them subtle, detailed, and melancholic. I was expecting something similar here but found the plot developed like a bad soap opera and ended in a truly modern and shallow manner. The historic background to this period - fascintating in itself - was sometimes referred to but usually under-developed and the characters were rarely truly fleshed out properly.

The Buccaneers is reminiscent of the times of Edith Wharton's novels. It's the story of four ""nouveau riche"" young ladies from New York, who are shunned by traditionalist society, and set out to England to perhaps win-by love or by their fortunes-better circumstances for themselves and their families. But all that glitters is not gold; and these four different women, childhood friends - will learn that life is not always a gilded path as they thought their lives would be. That childhood dreams of romance can be dashed. That circumstances test the bonds of friendship. They would in fact, have some growing to do. And learning. And in doing this, they would come to realize their own true characters. And finally, that society's rules are nothing compared to the values that a person holds in their own heart.

This movie is a testament of what very hard times these were for women-times of being repressed and without means of one's own. But there's hope in the end.

Excellent performances across the board, but in particular by Carla Gugino and Mira Sorvino, two vastly underrated actresses.

745221,4,630394325X,"My review of 'The Buccaneers"" is confined to the screen production as I've not read Edith Wharton's unfinished novel of the the same name. Some of Wharton's works have been successfully adapted for the big screen such as The Age of Innocence [with Daniel Day Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer] and The House of Mirth [with Gillian Anderson]. In The Buccaneers, we follow the adventures of a group of nouveau riche aka ""New Rich"" American girls - sisters Annabelle/Nan[ Carla Gugino] and Virginia St James [Alison Elliott], Lizzy Elmsworth[Rya Kihlstedt], and Conchita Closson [Mira Sorvino]. Since their New Rich status bars them entry into the Old Rich high society of new York, they go off to England in search of well-connected husbands.

The girls attract the attention of men of the English nobility who in some instances, have only prestigious titles to their names and not much else. All the girls get married but with the exception of Lizzy who makes a stable and happy marriage, the others end up being miserable with their choice of husbands. Conchita [Mira Sorvino] marries Lord Richard, a weak-willed alcoholic, Virginia marries Richard's brother Lord Seadown [Mark Tandy] who marries her only for her money, for he has a long-standing affair with an older woman [Jenny Agutter], and free-spirited Nan [Carla Gugino] settles for the Duke of Trevenick, though her heart belongs to Guy Thwaite [Greg Wise aka Mr Willoughby of Sense & Sensibility].

""The Buccaneers"" is at heart the story of Nan, and her fight for the right to be her own person despite a calamitous marriage, and the restrictions that her position as Duchess of Trevenick imposes upon her. Carla Gugino shines in her role, and her transformation from an idealistic teenager into a mature, young woman who learns to deal with the harsh realities of life is very credibly done. The other noteworthy performance is of Nan's governess, Ms Test Valley[Cheri Lunghi], who portrays a woman who has had to fend for herself by working as a governess since she was 17, and at the age of 40, finds herself bemoaning the fate of women during her time, the inability to live their own lives the way they deem fit, and to not have the choice of loving whom they please.

A brief note on the DVD - it seems that BBC Video has put The Buccaneers onto a single DVD with Side A containing 3 episodes, and Side B the remaining 2 episodes with an added feauturette about the production of the series. In all, the series itself runs to about 5 hrs.

In conclusion, this is a well-made period drama that will appeal to fans of the genre, and has lush landscapes, not to mention sumptuous costumes and of course, fine acting by an ensemble cast.",1204934400,,2693,4.772532188841201

The film gives a good understanding of the societal hierarchy of that era, and of the desparate social climbing that took place among newly rich Americans.  After land laws were passed in Britian in the 18th century, a good portion of the aristocracy, whose fortunes were land based, became impoverished, although they still retained their titles along with their social status.  During this period, there were more than a few American heiresses who married impoverished British aristocrats. These women traded their father's money, for the social status that had been denied them in the United States among ""old money"" society.

Everybody in this movie makes idiotic choices and then blames society.  Nobody accepts their contribution to the misery and stupidity of their own lives.  It's alway the fault of society.  Isn't that criminal reasoning?  It gets very frustrating after a while.  My favorite part was when Michael Kitchen's character called the governess on this very behavior (I love you, Mr. Foyle!).  She was sobbing something like, ""Why can't a woman ever have free will!""  And he said, ""Well, you certainly exercised your free will here.""  Which was absolutely true.
All these young women are extremely wealthy and get married of their own volition on a whim and then cry about the cruelty of society for the rest of the movie.  I would have enjoyed this movie if the moral had been ""Make wise choices.""  But the moral was ""Society is a cruel mistress.""  And it was annoying because everyone's misery was their own doing.
Mira Sorvino's accent was a continual delight.  Why couldn't she have been the main character?  Her storyline seemed the most touching, too, but we only get glimpses of it.  Her accent was really too cute.  Best part of the movie.  But why did everyone seem to think they speak Spanish in Brazil?

745420,4,630394325X,"This BBC miniseries is adapted from the last, incomplete, novel by Edith Wharton. It follows the lives of four American girls of the nouveau riche (new rich) of the late nineteenth century.  Shunned by the old established families of the time, the girls travel to England for a ""London season.""  All of the girls are soon married into the British aristocracy.  But, be warned, this is not a romance.

Edith Wharton was born in 1862 to a wealthy New York family.  She knew the wealthy and powerful of the age.  She was a part of upper class American society but also a harsh critic of it.  Her novels illustrate the provincialism, elitism, ignorance and bigotry of the period.  Wharton won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature for her novel The Age of Innocence, in 1921.  She was the first woman to win the award.

Wharton died on August 11, 1937 with this novel incomplete.  The story was published the next year as it stood when she died.  It was not until 1993 that Marion Mainwaring was commissioned to complete the story and two years later the BBC produced this miniseries based upon the novel and Mainwaring completion.

Recommendation:  I certainly recommend The Buccaneers as a complex and interesting tale of the period, but don't expect everyone to live happily ever after.

Finally, if American heiresses crossing the Atlantic to marry into the British aristocracy fascinates you I recommend, To Marry an English Lord by Gail MacColl and Carol Wallace as an entertaining history of this Victorian era phenomena.

""The Buccaneers"" was indeed a hardcore drama, but focused on the unhappy relationships of all the characters, and the consequences of their decisions in marriage and elsewhere, with little or no redemption.

745551,2,630394325X,"Based upon the glowing reviews read on this web-site I purchased the above movie and found myself wishing I had not.  First of all, I have never read Edith Wharton (I just haven't gotten around to it yet), so I was not sure what to expect.
I was hoping for a great period costume drama--well, Buccaneers is definately that; the costumes (and sets) were fabulous--but I was also looking for another great romance to put on my shelf.  Buccaneers was not it.
My major problems with the movie are as follows:

1. Sex, lust, adultry, infidelity: and lots of it. To an annoying degree. No character comes out unscathed whether directly or indirectly.
2. I was looking for Austen: she loves him, but doesn't know it; he's maddly in love with her, but engaged to someone else; etc. I ended up finding something quite different. Another review wrote: 'I don't think [The Buccaneers] was ever meant to be taken terribly seriously.' I disagree. Of course Edith Wharton would want her book taken seriously; from what I have read about her, she wanted to expose the underlying darkness, the faux pas, of society.  The movie (and, I am assuming, the book) was a commentary on how things do not always turn out like you think they will and nothing is how it appears on the surface.  Now, in general I do not mind this kind of 'hocus pocus', but in Buccaneers the underlying drama always has negative connotations. No one is truly happy and everybody is pretty miserable behind their veil of well-bred society and/or cheerfullness.
3. The ending (which I will not give away) felt strangley forced or contrived, perhaps due to the fact that Wharton died before finishing the the book (and so it was finished for her). The final scenes did not feel like a natural progression story, but only Wharton knows how it truly ended.

All in all I liked the acting, the sets, and the costumes, but I came out hating the choices all of the characters made. I kept yelling at the TV screen, ""Why are you doing that!"" and found no answer.
If you're looking for something 'Jane Austeny' with its sweet innocence and charm, don't buy this (purchase Wives and Daughters instead). If you like period dramas merely for their sets and costumes, then you'll like this. For me Buccaneers was too negative--a dismal out-look on life.",1166745600,21,2295,4.6683168316831685

745553,5,630394325X,"But then, I like Edith Wharton.  I don't know why, but I do.  Past life bleed-through, maybe.  The costumes were wonderful.  Although I have read others who said they did not like the ""new"" parts (E.W. did not finish writing the novel) I disagree and thought that they were perfect.  I think they are just what old Edith would have written if she had been writing in the 21st century.  But above and beyond everything, the locations were fabulous.  If you like this type of melodramatic period piece you are sure to enjoy ""The Buccaneers.""  You just have to remember when it was written, and by whom, and for whom.  I don't think it was ever meant to be taken terribly seriously.  It is entertainment.  It is even better if you know a little bit about the people Edith was drawing upon for her characters.  Consuelo Vanderbilt, for one, I think.  A little background research and ""The Buccaneers"" becomes rather juicy and delicious -- if you like 98 year old gossip.

That said, I loved The Buccaneers!

The first episode was difficult for me to get into, as it is a little more crude than I had expected for a period piece. However, I kept watching, and before I knew it, I had flown through the entire series in one afternoon! It was wonderful! The costumes are outstanding, the sets are magnificent, and the acting superb. At times, it was a bit overdramatic, but I find that is usually the case with films set in this time period.

It has been criticized for having been ""Americanized"" for the American viewer, and while normally that would be reason enough to turn me off from a film, in this case, since it IS about Americans, I didn't mind. I think it still ended with enough quirk for Europeans, and enough happiness for Americans. Irregardless of the ending, the body of the series is beautifully executed and worth watching.

Filled with frivolity, joy, anguish, lust, love, and laughter, I would recommend this series to anyone who loves historical romantic drama.

745556,4,630394325X,"I thought it was time to put the North and South DVD down and watch another BBC period drama.  I picked The Buccaneers because I'm a big fan of Edith Wharton and I love the novel (despite the fact that Wharton died before she could finish it).  The BBC adaptation, despite being filled with more than a little Victorian melodrama, is an enjoyable adaptation and I watched all five episodes in two nights.  Annabelle (also known as Nan) and Virginia St. George are two young ladies shunned by New York society because of their new money status.  So they move to New England to try their luck there.  Nan and Virginia, together with good friend Lizzy Elmsworth, meet a spirited Brazilian called Conchita Closson (Mira Sorvino) and have a great time smoking, drinking and passing off as English aristocrats in order to attend a ball.  Nan is given an English governess, Laura Testvalley, and she becomes Nan's most trusted confidante.  Unable to fit into Newport society, the girls move to England after Laura suggests a London season.  There Nan and her friends experience the differences between the American and English societies, the difference between the world of trading and the monarchy, and how marriage with English aristocrats isn't the fairy tale life they'd thought it would be.

I love the backdrop of the 1870s, how the new ways of the world clash with the old ones, how fast science is advancing and how the British monarchy is slowly coming to a standstill.  Those are some rather insightful parts of this mini-series.  The book explores this more than the series adaptation, but they illustrate some insights without losing focus of the central storylines.  The actors are all wonderful.  I'd never seen any of them before except for Sorvino, but they're a talented lot.  James Frain is great as the Duke of Trevenick.  He showed a great deal of depth and dimensions and made the character complex and compelling.  I also liked Ronan Vibert as Lord Richard.  Cherie Lunghi as the governess and Carla Gugino as Nan are great as well.  All of the stories centered on the girls' marriages and how they cope with the harsh realities of their callous husbands are quite touching if kind of depressing at times.  Nan's marriage to the duke is especially heartwrenching and her forbidden love for up-and-coming politician Guy Thwaite (Greg Wise) is romantic in a bittersweet kind of way.  The one thing I have against this series is that some scenes were a little too melodramatic and theatrical for my taste.  Why does overacting seem like a prerequisite in a Victorian drama?  And the ending doesn't seem like something Edith Wharton would have written.  But I'm glad the ending had been written this way, for it is bittersweet rather than tragic.  All in all, The Buccaneers is a beautiful production. The wardrobe is impressive.  The train skirts from the 1870s are gorgeous, a real eyeful for costume drama fans.  And there are some truly wonderful scenes in this series.  I especially love the parts where Nan gets lost in the artwork, especially those beautiful paintings in her apartments at the Trevenick estate.  This series is almost as fascinating to me as North and South and Richard Armitage (sigh), and the DVD is a great investment, the best ten bucks I've ever spent!  I recommend this gem.",1154995200,20,3315,4.838365896980462
745557,1,630394325X,"I love Edith Whartion, the Gilded Age, and BBC productions.  This film should have been an ideal purchase for me.  Instead it was a raving disappointment.

The first third or so of the series remained fairly close to the book, but the remainder mutated into soap opera sensationalism nonsense.

After watching this horror of a 5 hour series, I did a search online and found an interview with the screenplay authoress who admitted to tweaking the novel's plotlines to add interest and allow for the sensibilities of a modern audience.

In this particular miniseries liberties were taken with the storyline that completely affected the original intent and tone of the story.

Julius, Nan's husband, is portrayed as a bisexual, adulterer, and a marital rapist.  Watching Julius's characterisation unfold was like witnessing a train wreck.

Nan and Julius's marriage was supposed to be the story of how a relationship fails when two good people, very young and not knowing themselves well, rush into marriage and discover disillusionment.  Instead BBC treated its audience to Hollywoodized trite depicting Nan as a wronged wife ill-treated by a remote husband.

There was also something horribly off about the portrayal of Laura Testvalley's friendship with Nan.  I love period pieces and I understand that social customs regarding intimate friendships in the past might seem TOO intimate at times to us strait-laced Americans, but the characters' scenes started creeping me out.  The mood of the scenes struck me as more romantic than friendly/sisterly/intimate.  In a way it was almost a relief when Julius was ""outed"" because I almost expected the two women to fall in love.

The one bright spot in this wreck of Wharton was Greg Wise (Guy Thwaite) who played his character with complete conviction and looked gorgeous beyond belief in white tie ensembles.  It probably helped that Thwaite was one of the few characters allowed to retain the core Wharton penned him in to begin with.  I felt like most of the other characters were strangers.

The series has some nice sets and locations and costumes appear in all their Gilded Age glory.  Americans can't help but loathe the British aristocracy and their mercenery desire to marry money and then refuse to support their wives since it's beneath them to work.

745653,4,630394325X,"This is a version of Edith Wharton's last unfinished novel as completed by the BBC screenwriter Maggie Wadey. It was filmed barely 2 years after the first complete version of the novel was published in 1993 (Completed by Marion Mainwaring). It chronicles a very different time (1870s) when class distinctions were clearly marked and the nouveau riche found themselves curtly excluded from the ""old money"" aristocracy of 19th century America. The story traces the lives of 4 girls from such families who finding themselves rejected in the land of their birth, travel to England to try their charms and new found wealth on the titled aristocracy of the old country. How they fare and the breaking of their illusions form the meat of the story. One reviewer commented on the shallowness and blandness of the characters, of not being able to tell the girls apart. Some viewers may even look at these girls as twittering airheads. This is in part Wharton's doing. Edith Wharton was no admirer of the American upper class. She belonged to it, she experienced it first hand and she despised it and made it evident in her books. Wharton constantly pointed out her society's ignorance, provincialism and prissy narrow-mindedness. None of the girls here really ends up living happily ever after. One of the reviewers here stated that in the absence of Wharton's own ending, the BBC screenwriter has let one of the girls off at the end. But I tend to disagree. Even the heroine Annabelle's running away with the man she loves (supposedly a happy ending) is tinged with the public scandal of adultery, the loss of her titles and privileges, and exile to the other side of the world (Durban, South Africa). This is definitely not what any of the girls would have wanted. Everybody just ends up making compromises and settling for second best. But then such is life.

As usual with the BBC, this is a beautiful production, with gorgeous costumes and sets, filmed at various locations in the English countryside as well as in Newport, Rhode Island which stands in for 19th century America.

The DVD transfer is a rather more questionable affair. According to IMDb, Buccaneers was shot on 16mm film. In America, most TV shows are shot on standard 35mm, 16mm film being used usually for cheaper productions, especially sitcoms and series whose future is in doubt. The BBC alas is publicly funded and doesn't have quite the deep pockets of competing American studios, so many of even its major productions are on 16mm. The critically acclaimed ""Brideshead Revisited"" immediately springs to mind. For a 16mm film, this actually looks pretty good with strong, vibrant colours, rich blacks and just a slight amount of graininess which imparts a certain softness to the picture, much what you would expect from a 16mm print. It actually looks better than ""Brideshead"" does on DVD. What is disturbing is the rather odd (1.50:1) aspect ratio presented here. (Yes, I actually popped it into the PC to measure it.) Buccaneers is, I believe, supposed to be in 1.66:1 widescreen. The 1.50:1 aspect ratio means that it has either been cropped or it has had its mattes removed. Either way, it has been modified. Because of the odd ratio it has to be letterboxed into a 4:3 frame. It may matter only to a handful of cinephiles or videophiles but I do wish video companies would take more care in transferring their shows onto discs. Sound is in 2.0 Stereo and dialogue is always clear and distinct.",1147824000,155,3467,4.844856661045531
745654,3,630394325X,"As soon as you know that it's an Edith Wharton story, you know that it's about a nice, innocent girl (or girls) who gets caught up in the machinery of society and slowly and inexorably ground down.  In this case, Wharton did not live to write the ending, and the screenwriter let one of the young women off at the last minute.

What's good: the scenery and the photography.  Different English country houses from the usual are used and they are impressive.  The music is good.  The costumes?  I'll take their word for that.

What's not so good: the story consists of only 3 to 5 steps.  This is not a Jane Austen story in which events continue to happen and there are even some surprises along the way.  In this movie, three (or four) young girls frolic around in America, go to England, land English gentlemen and get crushed by English social machinery.

The characters: all three girls are vivacious at first.  That is all we ever know about them.  Even with five hours to work with, the screenwriter did not manage to make any of these young women into a person.  This is not George Eliot, in which the characters are complex and interesting individuals even when they live dull lives.  If you couldn't see these girls, you couldn't tell them apart.  It took me three hours to learn to remember their names (and I still can't remember the name of the fourth character).  Except for the Sorvino character (whose name I still can't remember), none of the girls had any gumption, as Allison Eliott herself said in the documentary.

It traces the love lives of 3 rich American girls (and a vivacious Italian girl, Conchita, played by Mira Sorvino) from their young, innocent and carefree days in America right up to their stay in England where the 3 Americans (Nan, her older sister Virginia and their friend, Lizzie) unexpectedly end up being married to rich/titled English fops and how the girls are forced to ""grow-up"" quickly and deal with the heartaches and demands that come with their marriage.

The heroine of the heroines is Annabelle ""Nan"" St George (played to perfection by Carla Gugino), a kind, naive but rather headstrong girl who marries a Duke (a sullen, uptight and boring young man who's more obsessed with the mechanics and tick-tock of clocks than he is of his young lovely bride). But Nan realizes later that she actually loves another, Guy Thwaite. Then, there're the villains - an unfaithful husband, a kept mistress but most of all, the domineering/greedy in-laws. However, over time, the girls mature and learn how to deal with and make a success of their ""situation"". In the end, they triumphed against all odds and emerged victorious, finding true happiness in love.

The male actors (who portrayed the husbands/lovers) are not worth commenting much on. All of them (save for Greg Wise) have a most haughty air about them that is oh, so hateful, although I admit their acting is good. But if only better-looking actors have been cast for the roles...

I watched ""The Buccaneers"" on videotape 6 years ago (in 2000!) and am glad it is now finally available on DVD. I loved this production and highly recommend it to fans of period dramas. The video I own is a box-set in 3 tapes. The story itself takes up 2 tapes. Tape no. 3 is a documentary on Edith Wharton's life but it features mostly still photographs and portraits of 19th century people and their costumes, pictures of old American houses from during Wharton's time and interviews with experts on American history and period costumes, etc. I think the DVD should contain the same special features.",1144972800,10,2417,4.931203931203931

This was screened in Australia what would have to be at least 10 yrs ago but I remember it fondly. It came out shortly after (or what is before?) Pride and Prejudice and actually was my favourite of the two at the time.

Edith Wharton's unfinished story is bought to life through the wonderful American/English backdrop of the 1870s. It follows the story of Nan (carla gugino) whose parents are 'new money' and are trying to marry their daughters into society. After a lukewarm reception in america they are taken to England where they make a real splash. Things are not all that they seem and soon they girls get more than they bargained for.

Outstanding performances by Carla Gugino as Nan and James Frain as Duke of Trevenich make this a must see. Not to mention the costumes and the storyline.

My sister and I adore this mini-series which was shown in Masterpiece Theater many years ago. Anyone who enjoys turn-of-the-century films such as The Age of Innocence, House of Mirth, A Room With A View and Howard's End or stories of the Astors and Vanderbilts will find themselves enraptured with this tale of 4 beautiful American women who find themselves being courted by sons of the British nobility.

At the center of the story are Nan (Carla Gugino) and Virginia St. George (Alison Eliott), and their friends Conchita Closson (Mira Sorvino) and Lizzy Elmsworth (Rya Kihlstedt) - four young women living in turn-of-the-century America, when social status and wealth were the most important considerations in a woman's life (these were the days of the Astors and Vanderbilts, after all). Early in the story we find Conchita married to Lord Marable (Ronan Vibert) and begins her new life with the English nobility. Spurned in Newport and New York social circles because they are considered ""new money,"" Nan, Virginia and Lizzy travel to England to visit Conchita and hopefully try their luck there. With the help of two enterprising older women, they soon become the toast of the town and are courted by several handsome and eligible young men. Virginia and Lizzy vie for the attentions of Lord Seadown (Mark Tandy), an enigmatic nobleman who is entangled in a scandalous relationship with an older woman (Jenny Agutter). Nan is pursued by the impoverished but ambitious Guy Thwaite (Greg Wise from ""Sense and Sensibility"") and the wealthy and reserved Julius (James Frain from ""Elizabeth""), the Duke of Trevenick. Lizzy is pursued by the common yet enterprising parliament member, Hector Robinson (Richard Huw). Courtships and marriages inevitably take place and the young ladies soon realize that British aristocratic life isn't always what it seems.

The mini-series offers beautiful scenery and costumes, great acting from members of the cast (including veterans Cherie Lunghi, Jenny Agutter, Michael Kitchen and Rosemary Leach) and a thoroughly engaging story. I loved the fantastic mansions, palaces and castles in Newport and England alike and the wonderful intertwining of the American and British sensibilities in the plot. It has ""one foot in America and another foot in England,"" as Masterpiece Theater narrator Russell Baker aptly explains.

Along with North & South, Pride & Prejudice and Wives & Daughters (all BBC produced, incidentally), The Buccaneers is one of my favorite period dramas  and holds a special place in my film library.

745733,4,630394325X,"There's something very comforting for some reason about watching pretty girls in lovely period costumes suffering in beautifully decorated English country houses, and here the girls are especially pretty and the costumes are especially lovely. The houses are also completely top of the line: Castle Howard in Yorkshire, the most dramatic house in England, is used for Longlands, the home of the Duke of Trevenick. But while visually this is a rare feast, dramatically ""The Bucccaneers"" is not quite all it should be. Edith Wharton started the unfinished novel on which it is based with an idea very much like her best social comedies: if wealthy nouveau riche American beauties could not make it into Old New York society, why not try to make it into the top of the British aristocracy by providing large dowries? Girls like Consuelo Vanderbilt and the wealthy Langhorne sisters of Virginia (on whom Wharton based her St. George sisters) did exactly that; but marrying into such position did not guarantee happiness. Nor in this miniseries, unfortunately, does it always provide much narrative excitement: the direction is not simply langurous but incredibly slowly-paced, and most of the acting is only passable, with a few striking exceptions (such as Jenny Agutter, who is very fine as the miserable mistress to Lord Seadown). But the miniseries also features at its end a terrific documentary on Edith Wharton, which raised my rating of it from three stars to four.",1124323200,4,1469,5.0995850622406635

745848,3,630394325X,"It's always hard to capture the spirit and the essence of a book in a movie, and that is what this movie suffered from.

As a fan of Edith Wharton and of American heiresses, I bought a copy of the book as well as the movie on a whim, and (ignoring the last two parts which were based on the script to this movie--and not written very well) I enjoyed the book. The movie, however, was a vast disapointment. A few of the actors chosen to play the parts were wrong: their voices, their mannerisms, and the way they played the character. The main character that comes to mind is that of Mrs. St George. Where in the book she comes across as a long suffering, social climbing, yet weak-minded matron, in this movie, she comes across as an air-headed, pampered society wife.

I was also disappointed with the way the characters of Idina, Seadon, the duke and a few others were portrayed--their characterizations were changed from how they were in the book, and not for the better. I feel as though attention was spent trying to create sympathy for characters that didn't need it, nor should have been sympathized with. This story is about Nan, and then Virginia, Lizzy & Conchita, and to an extent, Laura Testvalley.

The locations were vibrant and pretty, and while the costumes were somewhat accurate(fashion major speaking here), they looked a trifle cheap in comparison to the 1995 Pride & Prejudice movie, and even cheaper compared to 1997's Titanic. Costumes are my main disappointment with this period movie--they were bot sumptuous and dazzling.

But if you liked to book and are prepared to ignore some of the liberties taken with the plot and the characters, this is an entertaining movie. But warning--this is not Jane Austen territory. No light, bucolic comedy of manners with happy endings here. The Buccaneers is a tragedy of manners, and Wharton wrote the book with the tragedy and restriction society places on women in mind.",1096243200,3,1935,4.75

745854,3,630394325X,"I am a big fan of pulitzer prize winner, Edith Wharton, and this is one of my favorite books of hers. The movie tries to do justice to the pain and heartbreak that comes from being an American girl in the late 19th century. Unfortunately some things are so far taken from the book that certain characters lose their true essence. In the book never once did I feel sorry for Virginia, always relying on her looks, and competing with Lizzy, Virginia was truly shallow. While she was married partially for her money in the book this didn't seem to phase her as she quickly moved on to the Prince of Wales. Of course in the movie you are made to feel sorry for her, but I guess that was the direction the filmmakers wanted to go in. Also the filmmakers completely took out Mabel, Lizzy's younger sister, who was alluded to end up with the duke in the book.

The point that aggrevates me most though is how you are made to feel almost sorry for the Duke, I mean they made him so shy and sweet. The book features a man who lives under his mothers rule and is cold and distant in terms of Annabel, treating her as something to be dealt with and much prefering to spend time with his clocks. Why the movie completely changed his character is beyond me and really takes away from the movie, in my view.
My main point is that the movie is good on it's own if you have not read the book, but once you do you simply can't relate to all the added scenes and characters taken out of context. Thats why I urge everyone to read the book as it allows you to feel each girl's heart a little more deeply and understand her a little bit better. It's also very interesting to see Mrs. St Georges (Nan and Virginia's mother) opinion on the changing times since she playes a much larger role in the book.

It is set mostly in England  of the late 1800's/early 1900's among the aristocracy, tracing the plight  of four ""noveau riche"" American girls in English society..
The  movie opens in America where the girls are scorned by the old money for  being new money.  One of the girls manages to attract the eye of a black  sheep second son of an English lord, and the rest of the girls follow her  to England after her marriage.  The hope is that after spending a few  months in the esteemed society of the English nobility, the New York  aristocracy would have no choice but to accept the girls and their families  into NY high society.  While this would have worked, in England, however,  things do not go as planned.
Unlike Jane Austen's movies, where the girls  always make good marriages in the end, and the bad marriages are always  portrayed in a comical way, The Buccaneers portrays events in a much  darker, more realistic way. The aristocracy (which at this point in history  is suffering, financially) is preying on the young women for their money,  and the young women, some of them, are stalking the men for their titles.  Most marriages are not made for love, and even in those that are, there is  a price to be paid to maintain respectability. With main characters also  including a governess, a high-priced mistress, and an un-married  matchmaker, this movie also explores the alternatives for women who didn't  wish to marry, and the very stiff consequences facing a woman who wished to  be free.

The story itself is very romantic. It  traces the love lives of 3 rich American girls (and a vivacious Italian  girl, Conchita played by Mira Sorvino) from their young, innocent and  carefree days in America right up to their stay in England where the 3  Americans (Nan, her older sister Virginia and their friend, Lizzie) end up  being married to rich/titled English fops and how the girls deal with the  (totally unexpected) heartaches and demands that come with their  marriage.
The heroine of the heroines is Annabelle ""Nan"" St  George (played to perfection by Carla Gugino), a kind, naive but rather  headstrong girl who marries a Duke (a sullen, uptight and boring young man  who's more obsessed with the mechanics and tick-tock of clocks than he is  of his young lovely bride).

Her sister Virginia (Alison Elliot) is a snob, but still her heartbreak  is palpable when she actually realizes that her husband, Lord Seadown,  actually married her for her money (she asks him straight out during their  wedding reception) and later, she must endure his affair with the woman he  always loved.
Mira Sorvino is Conchita, the independent girl who sets  everything in motion by marrying Lord Richard, the black sheep second son  who drinks and drinks and drinks.  She never loses her spirit despite her  gloomy surroundings and makes the best of what life has dealt her.
Rya  Khylstedt is the last Buccaneer who marries a non-titled man and is the  happiest of the lot.
Their tutor (Cherie Lunghi), of course, makes the  ultimate sacrifice - she loves Guy's father, but then he discovers her  deception and casts her aside - and the ending to her story is ultimate  Wharton.
This miniseries is just plain wonderful, the four girls and  their tutors are superbly played and the characters are very well defined.  The supporting cast - Sian Phillips, Michael Kitchen, Greg Wise, James  Frain, etc - is nothing short of great.",960854400,7,1498,4.762645914396887
745897,5,630394325X,"I was totally in love with this novel by Edith Wharton and when I learned it was being made into a series, I couldn't wait.  And, I was completely thrilled with it.  This movie completely effected me in so many ways.  The  scenery, costumes and amazing English Manors could have carried this film  all by itself, but it didn't need too.  The cast assembled was STELLAR!  The story of four American girls heading off to English for a  ""season"" is an amazing setting for the best period piece I have  ever seen.  I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I mourned.  It had  EVERYTHING!  RUSH and get this movie.  You won't be sorry.  I promise!",956793600,6,635,4.4

Do yourself a favour and get this..you'll be thanking me for  it.",951696000,2,293,4.7254901960784315

7857229,1,630394325X,"My rating of one star has nothing to do with the production itself.  I did enjoy the first episode of the production.  I would have liked to be able to watch the entire production; however, the disc I received was damaged on side one.  (This production is on one disc that is two-sided.)  With Amazon you have only one month to view a disc and return it if it is damaged. I did not realize this as in the past I have had few problems with DVDs ordered from Amazon.  This DVD is visibly damaged with a large scratched area. I realized that when examining the disc after Episode 2 would not play.  In the future I shall order fewer DVDs at one time from Amazon and try to ensure that I have time to watch those I order soon after receiving them.",1503532800,,743,4.160839160839161
