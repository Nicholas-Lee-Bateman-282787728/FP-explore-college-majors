Yes that opening shot could be inspired by Orson Welles' opening of Touch of Evil, and if not, it only shows that Fisher has a true eye for cinema and an understanding of perspective  Some may call it ""moody"" -- often an alternate term for ""slow"" -- and the ending is a bit obscure,, but when you consider what he was up against (including alleged extortion like threats from a lead actor) this debut by the man who runs AMERICAN HORRORS is a preview of what would become realized media potential -- sort of like seeing Coppola's early films. There are not (yet) any ""later"" Hart Fisher films -- at least not full length -- but the future holds much for this true American talent. If you are into horror films and American cultural rarities, I say buy it!",1392336000,2,980,4.4748603351955305
8347427,1,B001WB6NKC,"What a waste of hard earned money.  The film company hyped this in such a way that I expected a lot from the film.  The film was a complete disappointment.  It was unremarkable , lacking suspense, chills or scares. It is amateurish and low budget to the max.",1251331200,4,258,4.333333333333333
8347428,4,B001WB6NKC,"Although this low-budget film was not exactly as expected, it did prove to be intertaining. It somehow showed the violence of this killer without showing real violence. Points were made, violence was there,he was a serial killer,yet true violence was lacking,so if that is what your looking for..... All in all.  A good movie.",1249862400,4,326,5.037037037037037
