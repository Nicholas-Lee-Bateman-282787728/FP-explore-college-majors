8312959,4,B001JIL948,A rare glimpse of prejudice of a racial nature not often covered making it unique in a way. It kind of tells in a way how events in people's lives can heighten and distort one's perspective of another and fill them with anger and resentment maybe otherwise that would not be present. Samuel Jackson does a fine job of being a not so nice person who uses his position to twist the rules. For me I found the story line different and compelling in it's uniqueness.,1401148800,,461,4.372093023255814
