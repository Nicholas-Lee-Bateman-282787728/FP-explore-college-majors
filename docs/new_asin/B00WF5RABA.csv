Deneuve's character, who we only see at the head of the dining room table, should have been played by someone 20 years older.  Chiara and Charlotte tend to play women who are a little more confident.  The lead, who I've seen in several films, tends to play quirky and even goofy characters.  I simply could not fathom Chiara and Charlotte falling for him.  I watched the film to the end, though.

7131304,3,B00WF5RABA,"3 Hearts,"" directed by Benoit Jacquot, is a drama about a romantic triangle. An homage to love at first sight romances, the film opens in a provincial town where tax inspector Marc (Benoit Poelvoorde) has been stranded. When he misses the last train back to Paris, he heads for a bar where he meets and is immediately attracted to Sylvie (Charlotte Gainsbourg), whos distraught over flare-up with her boyfriend and is unsure of her future. Marc and Sylvie make love and promise to meet the following week in Paris.

But Marc fails to show up after suffering a mild heart attack. Sylvie takes this as a sign and moves to America with her boyfriend. Marc never forgets her, but falls in love with an equally wonderful woman named Sophie (Chiara Mastroianni). They marry and start a fine life together until Sophies family comes for a visit. Marc discovers that Sophie and Sylvie are siblings.

Though the movie is filled with convenient coincidences and plot twists, it is redeemed by the performances of the three female leads (Catherine Deneuve plays the girls mother). Director Jacquot draws a major plot element form Leo McCareys An Affair to Remember with Fate separating Sylvie and Marc for years and then reuniting them under chance circumstances. The movie is given a suspenseful, often foreboding tone, by its score, which sounds as if it comes from a Hitchcock or noir thriller.

Blu-ray bonus features include an interview with director Benoit Jacquot and a theatrical trailer.",1437955200,5,1486,4.959839357429719

7131318,3,B00WF5RABA,"Welcome it as beautiful and meaningful, or curse it as terrifying, but life sometimes seems thoroughly determined by the random and the haphazard, by the unpredictable dance of the universe, the fickle finger of fate.

That, at least, is the world as we encounter it in Three Hearts, an underwhelming, if thoroughly charming, Gallic romance from the accomplished, prolific 68-year-old French writer-director Benot Jacquot (Farewell, My Queen, A Single Girl).

The occasionally moving, emotionally resonant Three Hearts pays homage to that most contingent, electrifying human experience: love at first sight. (The French term, coup de foudre, literally means ""thunderbolt. "")

The story opens on a bland, unpleasant night in a bland, provincial town, where a bland, if not too unattractive man named Marc (Benot Poelvoorde) has been stranded. A tax inspector sent from Paris to ply his bland profession, Marc has missed the last train home.

Marc will come to thank his lucky stars. He happens to stop by a bar where, by sheer chance, he encounters a lovely woman who seems undone by melancholy. They are immediately drawn to each other and talk the night away. Sylvie (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is in turmoil. Her relationship with her boyfriend has gone bad, and her future seems far too uncertain.

The couple end up making love, and promise to meet up again the following week in Paris.

As chance would have it, Marc misses the assignation after suffering a mild heart attack. And, um, as chance would have it (groan), his cellphone has gone walkabout, so he has no way to contact Sylvie.

Seeing his absence as a sign from Fate Itself, Sylvie moves to America with her beau.

Marc never quite gets over her, but he falls in love with an equally wonderful woman named Sophie (Chiara Mastroianni). They marry and begin to build a fine life together until Sophie's sister comes for a family visit. Oops! It turns out, by sheer chance (ahem), that the sister is Sylvie.

Held together by an absurd tissue of coincidences and surprise plot twists that would make many a screenwriter blush, Three Hearts is saved from total mediocrity by its female leads, who include Mastroianni's real-life mother, Catherine Deneuve, as the sisters' mom.

But perhaps the film isn't as simple to dismiss: It leaves behind a nagging feeling, a suggestion there's more to the story than its story.
Look at it again, and it seems clear Jacquot deliberately litters the story with elements that seem to undercut its blather about fate and destiny. That includes the score - from the opening seconds, Three Hearts is accompanied by an oddly suspenseful sound track that seems more appropriate for a Claude Chabrol murder-mystery than a romance.

Is this a clue that the film's hyperbolic handling of its themes marks it as an ironic satire and not a mess of earnest adolescent poetry?

It's too hard to tell, making the film all the more frustrating.",1473379200,,2925,4.971311475409836

7131334,4,B00WF5RABA,"Who amongst us has never in the situation where they realized, with horror, that the contact information from a chance meeting of the longed-for soulmate has disappeared in a cruel trick of the Fates?! Benoit  uses this predicament to build a psychological portrait where an ordinary, deeply flawed, man establishes relationship with two rather remarkable sisters. One relationship transcends time and space in what could be a French version of fatal, irrational attraction; the other is based on affection and love. What interests Benoit is the living dynamic, tension that develops between the two. How will it transform the 3 main players? Will it resolve or crash?

The three women (the sisters + the mother) are phenomenal, especially Gainsborough, who captures our attention with every minuscule gesture, feeling-tone while the man is intentionally irritating and exasperating. His utter utter inability  to process emotional information and experience emotional honesty is as exasperating as it is effective in ringing a tiny bell in our soul.... of the everyman who refuses to dance with his wife, feel his pain or ask for directions... Poelvoerde brilliantly encapsulates the selfishness, narcissism and utter inability to see the world through other people's eyes - thereby reminding us male mortals that we cannot establish a meaningful relationship with the fair sex without softening the heart, even a little bit.

On a more prosaic level, this is a yet another example about how an excellent film can be made with little money if one has the right ingredients. Something that, for example, Jim Jarmusch used to be a master of.",1457740800,,1640,5.248091603053435

*** spoilers below******

I agree the casting  is off with the man. He is not appealing in any way and i spent the movie wanting to tell him to straighten up. he slouches so much its weird. also it is not believable that these two women would fall for him , he rarely looks anyone in the eye or talks to the family. i would have him down as a sociopath. I think we are to assume he died at the end. But i like how the movie wraps this and changes it .

7131343,4,B00WF5RABA,"In ""3 Coeurs"" (""Three Hearts"" 2014) by Benoit Jacquot (""La d&eacute;senchant&eacute;e"" 1990, ""La fille seule"" 1995), we have a refreshing twist on a somewhat familiar story. When 'Marc' (Benoit Poelvoorde) and 'Sylvie' (Charlotte Gainsbourg) have a chance encounter (after 'Marc' misses his train back to Paris), sparks seem to fly between the two kindred spirits! They arrange to meet again in Paris in a week's time, but 'Marc' misses their rendezvous, or does he? Too many reviewers have given too much away, so I will try not to.

If anyone is already familiar with Benoit Jacquot: you'll know what to expect/not to expect. Being the pure ""cineaste"" that he is, some of the clever devices he employs can easily confuse/throw-off many viewers, like the voice-over narration about 40% into the film that was actually quite common in the ""nouvelle vague"" days. The somewhat surreal or inexplicable turn of events in the story itself, especially after the plot thickens; is all part of this filmmaker's approach.
However, what is important here is the overall quality of the work and, it gets high marks from me in all of its distinct components (e.g., the acting, cinematography, lighting, mise-en-scene, etc.), all of it was truly superb. The cast: Benoit Poelvoorde, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Chiara Mastroianni (playing along real-life mother), Catherine Deneuve, etc.

One final note:

I don't get some of the reviewers who felt that the actors in the film were not adequate in playing their characters. What a load of BS! Not everyone was born with movie-star good-looks, and I'm so glad that these actors (who are the antithesis of what you get in the Hollywood movie business!!)  were ultimately chosen, since they all bring an unique yet realistic appreciation. The story is an intelligent and refreshing take on: fate, chance, destiny, etc., and the ambiguous ending is a reflection of the very same. Very well worth it.

The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent. NTSC, French, (English subtitles), NR 106 mins. (BTW: this review is for the unrated version.)

7131344,3,B00WF5RABA,"OK love gone wrong story but I just couldn't move past the actors that were picked to play the roles. The actress Charlotte/Sylvie was plain, had stringy hair and dressed like a man the whole time. The actor Benoit/Marc is not even close to something a woman would pine for.  The character he played was also lacking, with his sickness, hysteria and chain smoking. Why would Sylvie even go for him? Bleh! I think if they made the actors a little more desirable to the audience, the movie would be rated better. Also, who doesn't exchange numbers when they meet someone they want to see again?

8712997,2,B00WF5RABA,"I actually quite like this film. My low rating is for Cohen's abysmal looking dvd, one of the worst film-to-dvd transfers I have ever seen.

8712998,4,B00WF5RABA,"The short pitch for this movie is quite deceptive.  It sounds like ""Before Sunrise"" with Ethan Hawke, but it's nothing quite like it.  While the acting is quite good, Benot Poelvoorde has the physical charm of a Sean Penn, and never did I feel that he was in love with Sylvie, or she with him.  It was more of a curiosity as she is married and he mentions early on how he easily falls for women.  What keeps the viewer glued to this complicated plot is how close the two sisters are, and it's this sisterly bond that drives this movie.

The main theme of this movie is not love, but loneliness.  All three of the main characters feel lonely.

There's a nice plot twist in the end that disappoints me.",1507161600,,700,4.297709923664122

8713003,2,B00WF5RABA,"**Spoilers warning: Don't read ahead if you haven't watched the film yet.

A disappointingly long, drawn out film about star-crossed lovers...sort of. The plot is thin, the lead actor (Poelvoorde) completely unbelievable as the man both sisters (Mastroianni/Gainsbourg) fall in love at separate times. Mastroianni delivers a beautiful, sensitive performance, while Gainsbourg is over-dramatic and seemingly unstable as a character (or a devoted sister?). Deneuve is gorgeous and the best part of this film, and one can't help but watch her in every scene she appears - she really has that ""it"" quality.

The film drags out an unrealistic plot abut missed opportunities, the music is completely inappropriate (imagine ""Jaws"" background music, when the scene is showing a humdrum family scene...I mean, what??), and there's a dangling plot line about a tax-evading town mayor that seems to be abandoned; it's set up as a contrast to the main character's profession versus his personal life choices, but again, unnecessarily dramatic and pointless.

The ending is ambiguous, as is the case in many French films. I spent nearly 2 hours watching this and am still in disbelief about the miscasting of the male lead, as he has less than zero chemistry with both lead actresses.

Watch if if you're a dedicated fan of Deneuve and/or Mastroianni, but otherwise...no. It's a complete miss from director Benot Jacquot.",1497744000,5,1408,5.272321428571429
