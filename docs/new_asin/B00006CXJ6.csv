7967240,1,B00006CXJ6,"As someone who is very interested in philosophy, I bought this whole 3 part video series. I should have bought Part 1 and watched it, before considering the other segments. If I had, I would have saved myself some money by not purchasing the other two. The video will mention a name of a philosopher and provide a very brief summary of only a portion of their perspective. Before you can blink an eye, they have moved onto some one else. The transition happens so fast it is shocking. There is no depth, in fact it is not even as thorough as I would imagine a Cliffnote might be on the subject. I would recommend taking the time to read your books and avoid this series.",1077840000,4,670,4.325396825396825
