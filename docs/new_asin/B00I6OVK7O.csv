8639629,5,B00I6OVK7O,"Judy Dench gives a wonderfully ""creepy"" performance as she befriends a younger and somewhat reckless colleague played masterfully by Cate Blanchet. This film is beautifully written and directed and well worth the purchase as an addition to any film collection",1403568000,,259,5.5
8639630,5,B00I6OVK7O,"NOTES ON A SCANDAL is a mesmerizing psychological study in personal, transgressions, perceptions, misconceptions and the search for the true meaning of love vs. infatuation, friendship and lasting partnership. Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett give incredible performances as one lives by deliberate and manipulative trechery while the other is more passive and nave in her posturing. They truly both do not realize to what depths they have succumbed to through their lives' experiences until circumstances come to a head that is beyond the control of either of their actions. This is an outstanding but often unpleasant film but well worth the experience.",1398124800,,652,5.401960784313726
