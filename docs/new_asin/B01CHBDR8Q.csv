7683234,2,B01CHBDR8Q,"We LOVE Clint Eastwood and were very impressed with Burt Reynolds in ""Sharkeys Machine"" but City Heat is tepid at best.
It's about the quality of a poor TV movie (we have not watched TV since 2001).
The acting is, I believe, what actors call a ""result oriented performance"". Poor direction, sets, dialog (uck!), the fight scene with Burt at the restaurant is bordering on embarrassing!",1464134400,,385,4.848484848484849
7683235,5,B01CHBDR8Q,"Impressive, crystal-clear Blu-ray impeccably put together as a showcase for Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds. I forgot how much fun this film was...and is.",1463443200,2,155,5.5
7683236,5,B01CHBDR8Q,Really good movie fast shipping.,1463443200,,32,5.6
7683237,5,B01CHBDR8Q,"I'm probably alone here but I think this is a classic. Not a Gone With The Wind classic, but a classic all the same. All I can say is bring on the furniture polish and enjoy the movie.",1462492800,4,184,3.8684210526315788
7683238,2,B01CHBDR8Q,"CITY HEAT finally on blu-ray by Warner bros
one of Clint eastwood's films that are not actually directed by Clint
Clint eastwood has the lead role but another Actor turned Director Richard benjamin
took over Directing for City Heat, when original Director Blake edwards was fired
Burt reynolds played the Great P.I. Mike murphy, Great performance by Burt.
the old dvd version had no extras either, just the usual Theatrical trailer
and guess what either does this new blu-ray reissue
obviously warners didn't want to spend any money getting new retrospect interviews
with Clint eastwood, Burt reynolds, Richard benjamin or Black edwards
otherwise there would be new extras on this blu-ray reissue, common sense really
so all you get is the same content as the old dvd version which is just the Theatrical trailer
warners only effort was upgrading the picture quality with new 1080p 1:85:1 HD transfer
which ofcourse looks more sharper & clearer than the old Digital remaster transfer
and a new 5.1 master audio mix
apart from that, that's all you going to get
mainly cause if warners wanted to they could've got a new retrospect making of featurette with Eastwood & reynolds
but of course they didn't want to, pretty pathetic
the only effort they gave was upgrade the picture quality, what else is new with warners
2 stars for this new blu-ray worth $5 or less",1461974400,5,1360,4.891774891774892

7683243,4,B01CHBDR8Q,I saw this movie when it came out and really didn't like it that much. The price was right so I bought it on blu ray. It is actually a pretty good movie and Eastwood and Reynolds were a good team. The blu ray is crystal clear.,1468454400,2,226,3.8297872340425534

7683245,1,B01CHBDR8Q,"To bad this DVD came from Sinapore, and we could not play it on our DVD. Total waste of time and money. I can't believe that Amazon would sell something like this. This is very disappointing.",1465776000,,191,4.333333333333333
7683246,4,B01CHBDR8Q,I enjoyed this movie when it first came out in 1984. Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds made a good action team. Plus enjoyed the humor injected in the various scenes illustrating their competitive on scene personalities.  The movie is fast paced and has enough action to keep up with the fast paced characters.,1465516800,,309,4.830188679245283
