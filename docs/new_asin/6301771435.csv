356250,5,6301771435,"I stand in total agreement with previous reviewers. We desire all nine hours on DVD. Why? This is a landmark movie about two great personalities. Wagner and ""Mad"" King Ludwig II. Both were visionaries well ahead of their time who both were born to find each other in order that their work could be left for a wiser and more appreciative society yet to come. Richard Burton gives perhaps the best performance of his life as Wagner who is shown in the film in true colors. Part revolutionary, forced to flee under constant creditor problems until the immortal King Ludwig II becomes his savior three quarters of the way through tape #2 (of the four current VHS tapes). The rest of the film dances between Wagner and Ludwig in their titanic struggle to provide the world with music and art while jealous people seek to tear at them like a pack of wolves. Sometimes when you dedicate your life to your dreams the world will try to destroy you and that is what happened to poor King Ludwig after the loss of his friend. Please! This is a great story that needs to be updated on DVD and NO CUTTING! You can't tell Wagner's story without Ludwig nor Ludwig without Wagner! People have a RIGHT to know and to see the treachery that Prussia and others in Bavaria conspired together against these two great men. As it stands the VHS tapes lack audio quality but the story is wonderful. The film is of course, long. So plan several nights of viewing if you can't spare nine hours straight. It will be worth every minute spent and when you see how they treated Ludwig, it will make you upset, but the truth hurts!",1085875200,23,1600,4.482876712328767
356251,5,6301771435,"Please when is someone going to release the entire 9-hour version of ""Wagner"" starring Richard Burton on DVD.  I'm not getting any younger and I'd like to own this movie on DVD before I die.  I agree with all of the other reviewers advocating the region 1 DVD of this film but it must be given the treatment it so rightly deserves, i.e., first class VHS-to-DVD transfer, lots of DVD ""extras features"", as complete a set of production liner notes as possible (the more info on this film and its subject the better), and first-class packaging (including a movie poster, while in most cases not worth the effort and somewhat tacky, would,in this case be a very nice extra touch.)
Obviously, I am Wagnerian and a BIG fan of this film and would very much like to see it available on DVD.  I believe that the equally long and just as esoteric film ""Verdi"", about the life of Guiseppe Verdi, has been released on DVD.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, I'M BEGGING TO WHOMEVER OUT THERE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, PLEASE HURRY AND DO SO.  I CAN PROMISE THAT YOU'LL SELL AT LEAST ONE THE DAY IT COMES OUT!",1080432000,9,1095,4.455
356252,5,6301771435,"I saw by TV the whole serie few years ago. Excellent ...  but why to buy and lose potential quality using old video technology?

356253,4,6301771435,"How can an industry immediately release recent second and third-rate movies on DVD while letting the movie ""Wagner"", with a cast including the likes of Burton, Gielgud, Richardson and Olivier, disappear from the available market in any format? Regardless of the opinion one holds of Wagner or his views, the fact that his contributions changed the world of art forever and are, in many ways, responsible for the medium we today call film, cannot be overlooked or denied by any serious consumer of art. Could we recognize modern cinima without the foundation of poetry, singing, acting, painting, musical composition and drama which was and is Wagnerian opera? Surely not! The release of this epic story, so critical to a true understanding of modern Western media, on DVD would expose a new generation of consumers to a fascinating and entertaining personality and greatly please some of us old-time Wagnerites as well! I ask all to voice their enthusiasm for this end.",1037318400,11,969,5.0625

356255,5,6301771435,As a wagnerite this production of the life of the great Richard Wagner deserves the most important place in film history of the 20th century. The plots and acting most accurately pictured all the essence of Richard Wagner as a person and a musician. I have been looking for the DVD release of this important work.

356256,5,6301771435,"I was fortunate to have seen a big screen presentation of ""Wagner The Complete Epic"" at the San Diego Opera House (nine hours in one day), many years ago.  Richard Burton really captures both the vindictiveness and creative genuis of this man, whose immoral personal life is so difficult to reconcile with his amazing compositions.  From his fecund mind sprang over a dozen great music dramas, culminating in the mythological trilogy ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"", arguably the apex of artistic expression in the western world.  In addition to Richard Burton, the huge cast includes Vanessa Redgrave as Cosima Wagner, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Laurence Olivier, and a few opera stars who have actually sung in Wagner's music dramas, including Gwyneth Jones, Peter Hofmann, Jess Thomas, Manfred Jung and Heinz Zednik.  Tony Palmer, who directed this movie, has created an epic of Wagnerian proportions.",973123200,109,903,5.293706293706293
356257,5,6301771435,"I cannot specifically comment on the entire 9 hour unedited version, but I did watch the abridged 5 hour version.  To be candid you have to be a great  lover of epic books or movies to enjoy this.  Perhaps it is too long in  relation to the dramatic content, even the abridged version; but then  again, Wagner's operas generally have the same problem.  Nonetheless it is  worth the effort.  For the record, in spite of the movie not having a  rating, there is some profanity, much of it uttered by Burton. The  production has many spectacular and controversial moments, such as the  burning of the Dresden Opera House during the 1848 Revolution, during which  Wagner is laughing heartily. Somewhere he mentions to Bakunin that such a  calamity was the best thing that could have happened to the place. The  rehearsals for the inaugural 1876 Bayreuth Ring were also skilfully  handled.  Much of the film was shot in Hungary, and Sir Georg Solti  conducts, throughout the film, the London Symphony Orchestra and the  Hungarian State Symphony Orchestra (as I recall).  Those who enjoy the  forceful, dramatic style of his Wagner will love this soundtrack.  I  thought Richard Burton played the title role reasonably well, even if the  make-up artists did not successfully capture the unsightly skin texture -  caused in part by erysipelas. Burton allegedly read almost every Wagner  book in print, which would be no small feat, prior to assuming the role.  Vanessa Redgrave as Cosima does very well, and looks even closer to her  original.  The huge cast is filled with very prominent actors, notably  among them Sirs John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier, who  act as disgruntled members of King Ludwig's government. These actors speak  in their normal English accents, which I found a little humorous in the  context of their Bavarian roles  (granted, the movie was somewhat wanting  in humor too). Laszlo Galffi as Ludwig was credible enough, and his  ostentatious building projects were interesting to see on film. The singing  where employed was effective (including Peter Hoffmann, as I recall). The  costumes, designed by Shirley Russell, were outstanding. The resolution  quality of the original film, dating from 1983, was good but unexceptional.  I cannot comment whether or not Wagner's true personage was presented  fairly, but he was presented as a self-absorbed, money-grubbing, two-faced,  opportunistic, polygamous, over-opinionated, xenophobic, racist musical  genius.  At the very least, it makes for an entertaining movie. If you  don't mind the length, this can be recommended.",957312000,21,2608,5.180722891566265
356348,1,6301771435,"I reviewed the other copy of this available on amazon -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner/dp/B0052E6EY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner</a>&nbsp;- which is over 7 hours and comes on 3 discs. The comments I made there are equally applicable here.

I'll admit something up front: I only got through the first disc. I really did want to like this. On paper, it looks like it should be fabulous: colourful historical character, great actors, great music, shot on location, etc. But I cannot bring myself to watch the rest of it. If you feel that disqualifies me from providing a review, I guess you should read no further. I wish you luck with your own viewing. For the rest of you, I am faced with a dilemma. Just how much detail should I provide, so that you don't think I'm simply an uneducated moron who is unable to appreciate ""art"". By the same token I don't want to waste too much more of my life on this film. So I've decided to just list out some of the problems with this film, rather than put them altogether into a cogent, well-structured argument. You can take from it what you will:

- The portrayal of Wagner as a spendthrift, vain, self important, emotionally cold, nasty bully is so relentless, that it quickly gets tiring. There is no contrast, no light and darkness. He treats everyone with scorn and contempt. So much so it's hard to imagine anyone loving him, or any woman wanting to have an affair with him. Whatever his faults, I find the portrayal hard to believe. And the allusions to Hitler in some of the Dresden scenes are altogether embarrassing and over the top.
- A lot of the scenes drag, much longer than is necessary, long after they've made the point they were trying to make, like the endless scenes of Wagner and Minna talking in their sitting room. And then we are presented with another scene that is essentially making the same point, but in another context. I realise some repetition is necessary to get across particular character flaws, but there's no need to beat your audience over the head with a sledgehammer. How many scenes do we need to establish his spendthrift manner? His German nationalism? His cruel treatment of his wife? Some judicious editing would have been nice. Making an ""epic"" doesn't mean that you just stuff everything you want into a movie, and exercise no critical judgment.
- There are a lot of long-winded speeches (Wagner talking at length, railing against anyone and everyone, with people patiently listening), or outright weird scenes and dialogue in the style of European art house, that just annoyed the hell out of me, e.g. where people suddenly cry out, or say something absurd. Like Wager standing in a crowded room at a function, screaming out, unnaturally, something like, ""Listen to me, damn you! Damn You! Listen to me! I'm Wagner!"" Okay, I get it, it shows he was desperate to be heard, that he felt like people weren't listening to him etc. But it comes across as clumsy and gauche. In another set of scenes, Wagner kept waking up from a nightmare and screaming: ""Nothing to do with her! Nothing at all to do with Mathilde Wesendonck!"" (his muse and potential lover). Okay, once I can forgive, but the scene repeated over and over? In another scene, also repeated ad nauseam, we see a dwarf blacksmith forging the famed ""ring"" in front of a fire. Speaking off which, there is one very odd scene where Wagner is talking to one his dalliances on a French beach and says, full of gravity, ""Where is there a blacksmith? Where? I need to hear the sound of metal being struck. I must learn to forge metal."" To which the lover responds, ""I must learn to walk."" They then walk along the beach, and she says, ""Richard, your words, your ideas, they fill me with confusion...love!"" He says with gravitas, ""Yes, love."" And she shrieks, ""I give it to you freely!"" all to the swelling strains of Lohengrin. I laughed out loud.
- The script is full of such purple prose, with people talking in a manner, and stringing words together, that is hard to take seriously. There's also a problem with Burton's delivery. It's like a theatre piece, as if he's on stage in some kind of Shakespearean drama. I just didn't buy it. It felt like I was watching an actor delivering a particularly bad script. It's as if he thought that every word uttered by Wagner was important, and that Wagner likewise must have thought that every word he uttered was important, even if he was just asking for toast and marmalade.
- Even when Wagner is quoting something that Wagner actually wrote, like his poem Siegfried, the extract is way too long. Okay, I guess the filmmaker wanted to establish just why it is that everyone in the scene is falling asleep or snoring, but do we really need that much to get it?
- Some of the scene progressions are unbelievably stupid and clichd. Like Minna telling Wagner ""I hate noise...bangs"" just before an explosion signalling the start of revolution in Dresden. To which she responds by dramatically turning her head and saying ""My God. It has begun."" Really?
- Some scenes and relationships with individuals are poorly set up and explained, like the love affair with Jessie Laussot. We're left with no explanation as to how this relationship came about (save for the ridiculous scene on the beach mentioned above), or what motivated Wagner other than a desire to get his rocks off.
- There's an awful sex scene, that includes a close-up, full-frontal (and totally unnecessary) shot of a woman's vagina, in the same art house style, replete with bushy, matted, curly orange pubic hair. Honestly.
- The film has a narrator. That's fine - the narrator is used to disclose elements of Wagner's story, and to explain some of the inter-relationships, but the tone is often the kind of tone that is used to tell bedtime stories to children. I found it cloying and annoying.
- Burton is way too old for the earlier scenes. I know, he was a great actor - yaddah yaddah - but it just doesn't work. It'd be like watching my grandfather trying to play me at 40. The problem is that we have an actor of advanced years trying to play a middle-aged Wagner.
- Some of the longer scenes start with music in the background, then the music suddenly cuts out when there is a shot change within the same scene. It's jarring and completely unexplained. I can only assume that when it was edited for television, the scene was broken up with an ad?
- Solti's conducting is a disappointment. Or maybe the sound just doesn't cut it these days? I was underwhelmed in any event.

Okay, I'll stop there. I think you get the picture. I rarely cannot watch something through to the end, but this qualifies for that distinction. Maybe in another era, as a television mini series, this might have worked. But not today.",1320796800,11,6816,4.706867671691792
356349,5,6301771435,O.K. from the ground up - let's start with the packing. I've never received any shipment packed so well or received so quickly and I've been ordering since the days of Sears Roebuck and before UPS. The product? Mint condition is putting it mildly. Perfect set box; perfect tapes/individual covers. Perfect video tape quality. Truly believe was only played once as was advertised. Seller followed up on order personally. Got much more than I expected in service and quality. Spend a few extra bucks and buy from this guy - you will know it's what you expect and more!,1288915200,,566,4.7272727272727275
356350,2,6301771435,"Burton is magnificent as Wagner. He should have won an award - not for his portrayal but for his being able to keep a straight face speaking this purple prose, drivel of a script. Anyone who thinks this is about Wagner needs to read a biography or gain some taste. The script is a horrible mess of incredibly bad writing. The music is good even though it is ""conducted"" by Solti, a grossly over-rated conductor who was good in the big, splashy moments but totally lost otherwise. Enjoy Burton but don't take this as a biography of Wagner.",1285804800,5,538,4.5
356351,2,6301771435,"If one could judge this set by its cover, ""Wagner"" would be a great miniseries. A high-caliber cast, colorful title character, sweeping music, breathtaking scenery, lots of political intrigue, and of course a large dose of lustful affairs ... but somehow, as much as I'd like it to work, it simply doesn't.  Others have commented on the poor quality of the transfer from video to DVD in terms of picture and sound. That is definitely a valid criticism. In addition, there are no closed captions or subtitles for the hearing-impaired.  That's the least of the problems; what this series really needs is heavy editing to reduce this nine-hour tedium to a well-paced three or four hour epic. (It would also have been nice to edit out the anachronistic highway traffic clearly visible when one character walks into a freezing lake to commit suicide.)

The opening five hours are so slow-paced that they quickly become stupefyingly boring.  The Shakespearean-trained Burton may have reveled in the lengthy dialogue his character speaks, but the audience is often left wondering what relevance his speeches have to advancing the plot, and it's not always clear.  There is also a great deal of
needless repetition, with rehearsal scenes, Wagner arguing with his laudanum-addicted wife, Wagner on the run from his creditors, Wagner making speeches about his vision of a united German republic, friends scratching their heads over how to cope with his spendthrift ways, and back again to the rehearsal scenes, often with screeching sopranos.  Perhaps these were meant to show recurring problems in Wagner's life, but surely there are more interesting ways to get the point across.

The performances and the music are the only saving graces of this entire production: the oft-mentioned Olivier, Richardson and Gielgud are true masters of the craft, and their scenes together are a treat to watch. Vanessa Redgrave and a young Gabriel Byrne also deserve honorable mention. Unfortunately, it's not enough to make this worth watching more than once - if you can make it through that.",1280188800,5,2070,5.106508875739645
356352,5,6301771435,"Richard Wagner was perhaps the greatest genius ever to write music (only Beethoven gives him competition).  Wagner managed to unite the arts of costume, drama, poetry and music in such a way as to recover the art of the ancient Greek theatre --andmore than this, he did so in a way that anticipated Freud and Jung and the great discoveries of psychoanalysis in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
In Richard Burton, one of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen (despite his seven nominations for, and never winning, an Academy Award -- a fact which should lend credence to anyone seeking to debunk these annual popularity contests), Wagner has an ideal and empathic portrayal: erotic, powerful, and utterly, totally, self-absorbed.
This is one of the best portrayals of a historial figure that I have ever seen.  It does not spare Wagner his faults; but neither does it neglect to give him his justly deserved merits.  It is an excellent and entertaining film.",1262217600,6,971,4.872727272727273

However I was totally disappointed that it was almost certainly produced by Kultur from the common VHS video tapes rather than from the film itself. ""What slop!"" The quality is so bad but it does not do any justice to this greatly anticipated effort. I will buy no more titles from Kultur if they are willing to do this for the sake of a few dollars. Still, I was quite astonished with some of the scenes in both versions, apparently done at actual locations such as Bayreuth, Venice, Zell am See, and Tribschen. One of the most intriguing and original scenes was the superimposition of actual photographs of the original performance over the film scenes as viewed by King Ludwig II in his private viewing of ""The Ring."" In all, this was somewhat worth the wait, but only to see the missing scenes from the 2 VHS versio.",1249084800,7,909,4.515151515151516

356357,5,6301771435,"This ten part 1983 epic television miniseries touches on all the major hits and scandals of Wagner's life from his young years in Dresden to his death in Venice, and every scene is played for maximum drama. Don't look for any quiet character moments here. There is absolutely nothing subtle about Wagner the mini series, but then again there is absolutely nothing subtle about Wagner the man either. Burton plays Wagner as a legend in his own mind, a man who begins as an arrogant political figure convinced of his own genius and dies as an elderly artist and national icon even more convinced of his own genius. Burton's voice echoes off of every wall of every room he enters, and each gesture is grand and theatrical. Wagner was never shy about speaking his mind, a personality flaw which got him into considerable trouble and forced him to spend much of his life on the road. Threatened with execution in Germany, he fled first to Paris and then later into a lengthy exile in Switzerland only to eventually wind up in Bavaria. Wagner demanded total loyalty from his closest allies, often including a ""sharing plan"" with their spouses which the great artist apparently considered a right granted by his own genius. He left many scandals in his time, particularly regarding his affair with the poet Mathilde Wesendock, the wife of one of Wagner's  patrons. When Wagner was working on the Ring Cycle he claimed he was making the artwork of the future, a kind of total artwork which fused many elements like poetry, music, dance and elaborate special effects. He insisted that he didn't make operas, but rather what he called ""dramatic music.""  Today, Wagner is categorized as a classical style composer, but in reality Wagner was the great rock and roll star of his time. His music was bold and incredibly extravagant and described more as Romantic in style. The series spends as much time on Wagner's political and philosophical views as it does on his music. Wagner was a great artist, but in all honesty he was not a very nice man, and the series highlights the more troubling aspects of his life. Wagner's selfishness and arrogance is also on constant display, as well as his willingness to swindle even his best friends out of their hard earned money. I know many people have downgraded this series for years because it portrays Wagner in a negative light at times, but he was human as we all are and made bad choices and mistakes. It is nice to be able to see Wagner's life portrayed in a honest way and never sugar coated as many other documentaries can be. Despite all of Wagner's flaws he was a musical genius and this 4 DVD set is jam packed with his gorgeous music to enjoy. Anyone interested in learning about Wagner's life and music will not be disappointed with this set.",1195344000,10,2785,4.681632653061224

And there's absolutely no rhyme or reason to what music is played when, let alone how these mischosen excerpts sound once they're spliced together.  There's just nothing going on in this film.

I probably would not have objected to this one if I have not already been acquainted with what I am now missing.

The backdrop of political and social intrigue in the Prussian and Bavarian states of the 19th century piqued my curiosity for the history of this period as well. No less fascinating were the characterisations of the people who played significant roles in his life, including Franz Liszt, Frederick Nietzsche, Hans and Cosima von Buelow, Minna Planer, Mathilde Wesendonck and King Ludwig II.

Equally memorable were the excellent performances of Richard Burton as Wagner, Gemma Craven as Minna (his first wife) Vanessa Redgrave as Cosima (his friend's wife and second wife), Laszlo Galffi as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Swan-King-Ludwig-II-of-Bavaria/dp/1860648924/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Swan King: Ludwig II of Bavaria</a>, Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud. Richard Burton's performance is indeed superb in so far as depicting the arrogance, megalomania, amorality and musical genius of  Richard Wagner.

While ""Wagner"" depicts a vile and self-centred man, especially with regard to the callous disregard he had for friends, wives, benefactors and peers, the film projects a balanced assessment of his contribution to the world of music and influence on German politics. On viewing ""Wagner"", one might actually have more sympathy for the people he used, particularly the romantic and generous benefactor King Ludwig II.

With regard to Kultur's pan and scan presentation of this acclaimed series, I concur with the previous reviewers. I wish Kulture had made a genuine effort to digitise and include some historical write-up on Wagner and the film's making. Nevertheless, this 4-DVD set is testimony to Burton's talent, the lavish sets, the detailed costumes and marvellous scenery shot in more than 200 locations around Europe.

Whether the scenes purportedly snipped from the original series make a difference is a matter of personal preference.

If they did anything to enhance it, it certainly doesn't show.  The sound is lousy as well.

This was Richard Burton's penultimate performance before he died and this lush, epic series was filmed on location in authentic spots in Europe (Italy, France, Germany/Bavaria. Released in 1983, the long series is quite a lot to take in for a single evening, and ends up imitating Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung opera cycle which were meant to be seen on seperate nights. The series follows the life and musical career of Richard Wagner. His first wife, Mina, endures a scandalous love affair with his Muse Matilde Wessendock (whom he wrote the opera Tristan and Isolde for) and Wagner is actively involved in the uprisings and revolutions of 1848. Eventually he acquires the patronage of the infamous King Ludwig of Bavaria. The ups and downs of this relationship is accurately portrayed. The building of Bayreuth, his marriage to Cosima, daughter of his friend and supporter the pianist/composer Franz Liszt are all dramatized as well. The look of the film is sensational, meant to resemble Wagnerian spectacles themselves. Especially striking is the symbolic dream-like moments and the repetitive use of a swan boat burning, perhaps meant to prophetize doom and the death of a legend. Like in the 1983 Boorman film Excalibur, Siegfried's Funeral March is used effectively. This is highly romanticized but remains fairly accurate to the real story.

It would have been the mistakingly advertised 540 minutes, if KULTUR had put every bit of repeating credits at the beginning and at the end of each episode, since those repeating credits run - believe it or not - 7 minutes for each episode.

This mini-series on DVD is a dramatized biography of one of most celebrated opera composers of all time, Richard Wagner (1813 to 1883) played by the late, great Richard Burton.  The movie begins when Wagner was just beginning to be known for his works (at age 35 or in 1848).

Despite its long length, this movie can be roughly divided into two parts: (1) the time Wagner was essentially poor and with his first wife, Minna (Gemma Craven) (2) the time Wagner met ""Mad"" King Ludwig II of Bavaria (Laszlo Galffi) and met his second wife Cosima (Vanessa Redgrave), the illegitimate daughter of his friend, famous composer and pianist, Franz Liszt (Ekkehardt Schall).

Be aware that this movie is interested in spectacle not introspection.  And what a spectacle it is!

Richard Burton gives what some say is his best performance.  (Contrary to what other reviewers say, this was his third to last movie role.)  Wagner was a scoundrel, joker, philosopher, con man, womanizer, poet, refugee, virulent political orator, and one of the greatest composers who ever lived.  Burton conveys all these characteristics in his exceptional performance.

The star-studded supporting cast (Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson, etc.) have bit parts. The narrator (Andrew Cruickshank) does a good job with his unique voice of providing continuity between the ten parts of this mini-series/movie.  There are standout performances from Gemma Craven as Wagner's first wife and Laszlo Galffi as King Ludwig.

The music (all by Wagner) is fantastic.  (The music was conducted by the great Sir Georg Solti.)  Unfortunately, we only get to listen to bits and pieces of it.  However, this is in accordance to what Wagner would have wanted.

Wagner called his operas ""music dramas.""  This means that music should not dominate drama.  And this is exactly what occurs in this movie.

This mini-series was filmed in more than two hundred separate locations, over seven months and in seven European countries.

Do you have to be a Wagnerian fanatic to understand this movie?  No.  However, I read a short biography of his life before viewing this movie and had a list (with dates) of his thirteen principal operatic works while viewing this movie.  I especially found helpful the brief printed part summaries that are included with this DVD set.  These items aided my understanding of the movie and, as well, made it easier to follow.

The picture and sound quality of this DVD, I felt, were acceptable.  (Part #9 has occasional flickering).  All interior photography is fantastic.  All costumes are authentic and magnificent.

There seems to be some confusion as to the true length of this movie/mini-series.  Here are the times my DVD player obtained for each of the four DVDs respectively:

136 min, 38 sec (written as 136:38), 131:24, 96:54, and 104:38.

Adding these times up, the total time of this DVD set is:

468:54 or about 469 min (7 hr, 49 min).

Now the original TV mini-series length was 540 min (9 hr).

Does this mean that this DVD set presents a cut version of the original TV series.  Answer: Yes and no.  The only thing that's cut is the opening credits for each part (except part #1) as well as the closing credits for each part (except part #10).  All acting scenes that were presented on TV are UNCUT.

Proof: The opening credits for part #1 take 4:58.  The closing credits for part #10 take 3:26.  Doing the math:

540 - [(9 x 4:58) + (9 X 3:26)] = 469 min.

Finally, this mini-series focuses on Wagner's operas giving the impression that he only composed these.  Not true!  He also composed beautiful orchestral, piano, vocal, and choral music.  He also wrote important literary works.

In conclusion, this is a spectacular mini-series/movie.  Be sure to see it so as to learn more about the man who said, ""Poetry is the reason for music and drama is the reason for both!!""

With such glorious music, 5-star acting and profound mythological/philosophical references, artfully put together by the brilliant Tony Palmer, we are instead given a spliced, disjointed and frustrating facsimile. Wagner's life and work really constitutes an epic or legend, whatever his politics - his characters being parts of ourselves. As a devoted Wagnerite, I had to have this set, and if it weren't for the acting and the scenery, the terrible interior lighting and lengthy focuses on the composer's revolutionary past, would have driven me mad. Somehow this all seemed woven together in the original, and chopped up by Kultur. Sound is poor too...but as it's Richard Burton at his best, and because practically every one of the world's REAL actors, many deceased,are really enjoying themselves,it's worth buying.",1118188800,16,938,5.218543046357616
356492,3,6301771435,"Can't get away from his opera's so I was very courious to this biopic. The life and times of Richard Wagner. Now available in an almost 8 hours edit (was the original 9 hours?) on DVD. I haven't seen the video from this production but it seems to me that the transfer to DVD is not expecially well done. Personally I don't mind but from a production this big a better effort on the image enhancement might have been expected.

Richard Burton plays Wagner from the age of 35 to his last days in 1883. Burton has certainly the weight as an actor to give life to the enormous ego that Richard Wagner was. This works expecially well with Wagner in his old age. The presence of Burton there really fills the screen. The rest of the cast is also  impressive: Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier.

What I do miss in this stellar cast driven mammoth production is that it fails to bring you back in time like for instance ""Ludwig II"" from Visconti does. It stays a, well, ""stellar cast driven mammoth production"". Not in the last place by the way Wagners' music is used as soundtrack. With the music Richard Wagner has written you have literally the soundtrack of a lifetime. Alas, in the soundtrack of this movie that music is used as Solti conducted it: bombastic and one-dimensional. With its excessive use of Nibelungen-motives throughout the whole movie you don't get a clear view of the chronology of the music written by Wagner in his life. This is a pity because you want to get a cut on the relationship between life and music written. Another important thing: the music fails to move you, to create beauty (with an exception for the instrumental version of Isoldes Liebestod). The way Solti pushes the brass section through the roof (Siegfried's Trauermars!) is an ordeal for the ears and ruins some of the most beautifull music ever written.

It was Mark Twain who said that Wagners' music is actually better then it sounds. In this movie Wagner looks better then he sounds.",1118188800,16,1990,4.628895184135978
356493,1,6301771435,"I recently purchased the Wagner epic on DVD. It seems as though the manufacturers are sloppy these days. The sleeves on the DVD cases indicate that DVD's 1 & 2 contain parts 1 - 5 of the movie when the labels on DVD's 1 & 2 indicate 1 - 3 and 1 - 6, respectively!

Another troublesome finding is that the total the number of minutes of the epic, including credits, is 470 minutes and not the 540 minutes as advertised.

The most important thing of all -- I found it funny that scenes which I remembered from the VHS version were not on the DVD version so I performed a little experiment. I compared a few portions of the tapes to the DVD's and lo and behold discovered that parts were edited out! For example, those of you who are familiar with the epic will remember the part where Von Bulow is writing a letter to Cosima indicating that he wants to drink prussic acid. (This scene follows the one where Nietzsche is in the war against France and is sitting under a tree contemplating his Will to Power.) This scene is not on the DVD version. Another edited scene is where Wagner and Cosima are at dinner with Nietzsche who tells Wagner that there is published proof of his (Wagner's) insanity. (This scene follows the one where Wagner is at a Wagner Society meeting, rises from his chair and walks out onto the balcony. On the VHS version, the dinner scene follows; on the DVD version it is lost.)

These are just a few of the problems I found. I have no doubt there are more. I do not blame Amazon but I do blame Kultur for not having the quality control necessary to catch such inexcusable flaws in the production.",1117843200,30,1618,4.333333333333333

356495,4,6301771435,"Richard Wilhelm Wagner (1813-1883) was the originator of the music drama. His mythic subject matter, large scale productions and thunderous music are still an influence in everything from extremist politics to contemporary film epics.  His majestic, emotional, sometimes overwrought music is sampled by today's movie composers.

The man and his music are still controversial. Performances of Wagner's ""Der Ring des Nibelungen,"" ""Siegried"" and ""Die Walkure"" stir protests and even death threats.

The four-disc, nine hour WAGNER (Kultur) is an epic DVD appropriate to its enigmatic subject.  His story is like a fairy tale. Born in poverty, he rose to great wealth and fame.  Loved and despised, he was a dangerous revolutionary and a romantic who married Liszt's illegitimate daughter.

Richard Burton, in his farewell -- and perhaps best -- film performance, does justice to this towering, sometimes vile, creative genius.

The heart of the film is the relationship between King Ludwig II and Wagner who struggle to create ""art for future generations"" while political forces conspire to destroy them.

The huge supporting cast includes Vanessa Redgrave, Laurence Olivier, John Guilguld, Ralph Richardson Marthe Keller, Franco Nero, Cyril Cusack among others.

356496,2,6301771435,"An interesting psychological phenomenon invariably afflicts 'fan' reviewers of film adaptations of books, literary classics, plays etc. in that ratings given for such films tend very much to be polarized. Essentially, people either love them or hate them.
In biopics the same effect applies and here we have a film (albeit I am rating the 5 hour abridged version) that charts the story of Wagner's adult life as an opera composer. This film will, above all, attract Wagnerians and will be of little interest to non-Wagner enthusiasts (let alone non-opera enthusiasts) and it is at this group that my psychological analysis is directed.
I would rate myself to be something of a Wagnerian, albeit of the fledgling variety (I have only followed his operas and read books on the man over the last three years and have not even got my name down on the 9 year waiting list to attend a Bayreuth performance of a 'mature' Wagner opera!) but nevertheless believe that I am sufficiently qualified to address the issue described although, paradoxically, am not immune to this very polarization effect, therefore.

The problem is what are we rating here? Are we rating a taxonomical account of Wagner's life in animated picture or are we rating an artistically motivated film?
For me, it is difficult to justify the creation of this film based on what I have seen. Truth be known I have only seen some 3 hours of it so far (it feels like the whole 9 hours) and I will re-review this if the final two hours tempts me to increase the rating by a star. Ultimately, this artistic medium is not exploited as a means of conveying to the viewers the struggle, the passion, the drive, the very essence of the man. We are left with a rather insipid, biographic account of Wagner's life aptly exacerbated by the lifeless and frankly tedious narration of Sir John Gielgud. Indeed, the cameo-esque presence of Olivier, Richardson and Gielgud serves only to undermine the purpose and relevance of this film which would have benefited immensely from being in German with real German film actors rather than hammy thespians.
We hear Wagner recount the struggle he is undergoing but Richard Burton never emotionally expresses and, as a corollary of the lame direction, is never allowed to emotionally express his inner struggle. Furthermore, and sinfully so, the music is never really appropriately used as far as I'm concerned. The overuse of the Nibelung motif really grates. I mean, surely a more appropriate backdrop when Ludwig and Wagner are 'plotting' the making of Bayreuth and the expansion of Wagner's romantic vision is not the music of the sinister, scheming Nibelung but rather the dreamy, romanticized vision of the Lohengrin overture.
The same music is used when Wagner addresses the audience in the auditorium of the Dresden opera house regarding his revolutionary inclinations. Why use such 'sinister' music? Is the director portraying Wagner, from the start, as nothing but a slimey, scheming Alberich? Wotan may be Wagner for some and Wotan may, indeed, be light Alberich but portraying Wagner as an evil schemer from the start is incommensurate with the general portrayal of the character throughout the film.

A model example of a biopic of a romantic visionary is Luchino Visconti's ""Ludwig"". I believe it was originally shot in German although the version I own is dubbed in Italian but nevertheless not having it in English, at least, serves to increase the sense of being in a different world, in a different time, with different ideals; this is lost in ""Wagner"". Furthermore, Visconti has a cohesive vision of Ludwig's life adapted to film - as one who in his youth has a romantic vision of his life, that falls under Wagner's spell and that falls apart when his dreams are shattered precipitating a decline into decadence and despair. This theme is neatly juxtaposed with the music used concentrated on extracts from Tristan Und Isolde, Lohengrin and Tannhauser - Ludwig's favourite operas - rather than endulged in the full Wagner operatic repertoire which is much the fault of ""Wagner"".

So, is my view a negative polarization of the highly positive ratings of the vast majority of the Wagnerian reviewers on this board? Well, possibly, who am I to be impartial? What I will say is that the very least I would have liked to see was some kind of consistent thread or vision of Wagner the man and Wagner's life. I feel this is completely missing here and is, as a consequence, vastly inferior to other such, more artistically driven, biopics of musical legends such as Mozart and Beethoven as conveyed in ""Amadeus"" and ""Immortal Beloved"" respectively.

It's all well and good producing a grand, quasi-never ending homage to a man who himself was rather fond of producing artistic fetes on an epic scale but if there is no real cohesive vision, no real sense of Wagner the man and what drove him, underlying it, essentially if there is no real point to such an epic then you have to ask the question: why bother? Wagner's epic ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"" has a point, this film ""epic"" hasn't!",1113696000,16,5088,4.885416666666667

Here the viewer can watch Wagner's life unfold in a 9-hour film in which the legendary composer shines out through the impressive talent of none other than Richard Burton.

 The film follows Wagner's life and his relationship with his most generous patron, Mad King Ludwig II of Bavaria. King Ludwig loved Wagner's work so much that he built an opera house just for Wagner where, to this day, only his operas are performed. King Ludwig was so fond of Wagner's teutonic works that he bankrupted his royal treasury to build a most splendid castle in the Bavarian Alps called ""Neushwanstein"" or New Swan Castle; a majestic romantic castle decorated with all types of teutonic motifs.

It stars Richard Burton as the composer. He is sometimes wonderful, sometimes doing a passable reading of lines. He was too old for the younger version of the composer, and not at all charismatic. In fact, he makes Wagner a frustratingly unsympathetic person. Your opinion about this production will hinge on whether you like Burton or not.

The locations are real and feel just right. Gielgud, Richardson, and Olivier are all in this. Vanessa Redgrave is in this. Production design is first-rate. The awful man versus the genius composer makes for a fascinating drama. His sexual escapades are fully in place. The singing is by the reigning Wagerians of the time: Jess Thomas, Peter Hoffmann, Gwyneth Jones, and others. Wow! Solti provides the conducting for the background music (all Wagner, of course), and the operas.

Someday people will realize that showing an actor flailing their arms around ""conducting"" is inaccurate.

7815041,5,6301771435,"Richard Wagner is arguably the most significant musician from the last three hundred years, because he introduced the element of atonality into music, a radical departure for the times, and still. Take your pick of any Twentieth Century classical composer, Cage, Crumb, etc., or for that matter, popular music such as heavy metal and Phil Spector  -- they were all made possible by Wagner.

Wagner, a mini-series celebrating the life and times of Richard Wagner, was made at approximately the same time as Amadeus, a movie celebrating the life of Mozart. There the similarities end. Wagner is a true epic, movie as much about a turbulent time in Europe, but also about a composer who was as controversial as he was influential. He was not the benign, childlike, genius portrayed so brilliantly by Tom Hulcy in Amadeus. While there are occasional dark moments in Mozart's music, Wagner's music, especially the selections in this mini-series, is dark, foreboding, imbued with intense seriousness.

As is the movie itself. In life Richard Wagner was a rake, a rogue a spendthrift, constantly one step ahead of his creditors, bigoted, petty, conceited, a hypochondriac, rarely thought of anyone other than himself, a brute, troublemaker, a con man, a trickster, a rabble-rouser, a user of people, a megalomaniac possessed of radical politics, and constantly in debt and asking for money from his friends or anyone who happened to be in contact with him. Hardly an agreeable subject for a general release movie, which may account to why this movie failed to enjoy the same success as Amadeus.

As portrayed in the film, Wagner's reputation, such that it was, preceded him, so he was a persona non grata rarely welcomed anywhere he went. As a result he created his own city, Bayreuth, a temple reserved to his music. So too, Richard Burton's reputation as an actor, both off scene and on screen preceded him before the making of this film, so in many ways, he was the perfect actor to portray Wagner. It is a perfect fit. Richard Burton brilliantly portrays Wagner with all the worts he acquired through his own life and transposed them successfully to portray Wagner's character. Burton always considered this the character he was born to portray, and he is correct. Burton conveys the dark foreboding of Wagner's character with confidence and ease. This performance, matched with the serious intent that characterized Wagner's music, is an experience to behold. This is Burton's magnum opus performance.

Sir George Solti specially conducted the soundtrack for this mini-series, an entirely appropriate choice considering that he was a major trailblazer in recording of Wagner. Solti made the first modern recording of the Ring operas in the early 60s, still considered one of the finest recordings of Wagner's music. Don't believe some of the other reviews of this film. The use of Wagner's music is both effective and tasteful.

While depicted as a conventional bio-pic, the performances at times have a stylized, improvised character. At moments, the camera will pan to a scene or to characters frozen in time, with Wagner's music in the background. Some of these performances are almost campish. Rather than detract, these moments add to the movie and give the film a Felliniesque quality. Thankfully, the actor portraying Ludwig II, the mad king of Bavaria and Wagner's greatest benefactor, could have been portrayed in this exaggerated manner; the actor's portrayal, on the other hand, is subdued and thus closer the real man. The screen writer, Leonard Wood, worked in close corraboration with Wagner's descendents. While this might have created the danger of a sanitized version of Wagner's life and music, Burton portrays Wagner's character with all its worts.

The length of the mini-series is daunting, nine hours, and like all true epics requires time and patience to view the work. It helps, of course, if the viewer is a lover of Wagner's music, because this mini-series will put a face, no matter how unflattering that face may be, and context to the music. This movie is a testament to Wagner's music and his life.

This movie is definitely a must-see for devotees of Wagner's music. Due to the controversial nature of Wagner and his music, however, despite the undeniable merits of this film, it will unfortunately not gain the same wide acceptance as Amadeus, or any other movie for that matter.",1345593600,4,4409,5.055020632737277

It is just a film and like most films it allows itself more leverage to mutate the facts than any legit biography can possibly allow itself. It's a veneer beautiful in its setting and this is where its true art lies which makes it worth watching. Wagner's character was far more complicated than Tony Palmer's somewhat monolithic portrayal. Supporting characters like Nietzsche are also affected by its simplicity. It is worth watching in the sense that Amadeus is worth watching namely as a scenic, costume and music fest only. In comparison, Amadeus amounts to character assassination whereas Burton's portrayal of Wagner is very much one sided and hyperbolized. In short, this film is far less biography than highly enhanced entertainment. Nevertheless, Richard Burton's exceptional performance is one reason I still like to watch it.",1322524800,,903,5.149659863945578
