8644067,5,B00IOFDKS2,"As I said in my other review for part 1 this is a great anime series. I love how the women in this anime have different looks and of course their bodies are accentuated as very feminine, strong, and attractive. Cobra of course is made to look handsome and his personality is flirtatious, goofy, and I love how he doesn't really take himself too seriously while taking on the guild. His character is similar to James Bond to a certain extent and he kind of is a womanizer but I wouldn't really say he's too much of a chauvinist where he completely degrades the female characters and treats them just as objects. I guess the only issue I have is this whole damsel in distress topic in the series. Cobra is almost always coming to the rescue when a woman is defenseless which is so necessary for this type of anime seeing as Cobra is portrayed as an alpha male and hero but the women are portrayed as beautiful, attractive, sexy characters who need a handsome, strong, sexy man to help them. I think Sandra was the only female character who didn't fall into that category because she was a villain.  Dominique, Jane, and Lady can defend themselves but have been rescued at certain points by Cobra. I just wish some of the female characters weren't portrayed as damsels in distress but that's the only complaint I have.  One last point I have is that I love how diverse some of the planets appear to be along with the aliens and people. Some of the planets have deserts, Middle Eastern architecture, temples, pyramids, futuristic cities, etc. Overall this series is pretty supreme in my opinion.",1483315200,2,1591,4.578947368421052

8644072,5,B00IOFDKS2,I grew up watching this and no longer live in japan.  I was hoping the anime had an improvement in the overall color but it was just the copy of the original tv show which is not all that fun when you have a HD TV.  Story is great!  It's really good stuff if you ask me.,1429488000,,270,3.7017543859649122
