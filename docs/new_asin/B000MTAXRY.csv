2748788,5,B000MTAXRY,This is really an enjoyable horror movie with character. It is a mix of horror and black comedy. The characters are great and strange.,1281916800,,134,4.625
2748789,1,B000MTAXRY,"Although the picture shown is from the european DVD the one that ships is the Mexican edition, which transfer to dvd is below standard. sadly the movie (arguably the best in spanish cinema history) suffers big time. I will never buy from viveros2007 again. Once again if you are planning on buying this item... I strongly recommend to download it from any torrent (even if this breaks copyright laws), because picture quality is gonna be 1000 times better!!
Sorry viveros2007... had to be said. Next time show the right picture in the product description. Highly dissapointed...",1256688000,22,578,5.03125
2748790,5,B000MTAXRY,"Spanish filmmaker Alex de la Iglesia followed his outlandish sci-fi/horror debut, Accion Mutante, with this colorful apocalypse fantasy about Father Angel (Alex Angulo), a scholarly priest whose intensive research into cabalistic ""Bible Code"" prophecies leads to a horrific discovery: the exact birthdate of the Antichrist. Convinced that Satan's spawn will be born somewhere in Madrid on Christmas Day, Father Angel embarks on a bizarre journey down the path of sin, committing the foulest possible acts against God and humanity in order to worm his way into the Devil's inner circle and face the ultimate foe on his own turf. Comprised of equal parts high-concept horror and scathing social satire (in the mode of the director's peer and former collaborator Pedro Almodovar), this ambitious horror film has garnered a sizable cult following.

2748791,4,B000MTAXRY,"Wow, what a terrific off beat Dario Argento type satanic horror film. Has neat Heavy metal soundtrack and real interesting plot premise about the end of days and Satan coming round the bend. With a nifty climax this movie is one of those you love to tell your friends about. Recommended. If you like The Omen you will like this.",1207526400,,328,4.483333333333333
2748792,5,B000MTAXRY,"I would like to explain the whole plot about this movie like other reviewers do, but I hate that, so I will not. If you find a crazy guy dressed as a priest and he tells you that today is the end of the world, think twice before you call the cops or your local mental asylum cause maybe this would be the adveture of your life.
Thumbs up Alex De La Iglesia for this awesome flick, great cast, photography, music (Def Con Dos performing as Satanika), special effects, etc. Believe me, this is a damn good film.",1199145600,8,509,4.204081632653061
2748793,5,B000MTAXRY,"A priest, a death metal nutjob, a talkshow host and Satan.  I can't believe this hasn't been released in the US.",1188345600,10,112,4.333333333333333

8172344,5,B000MTAXRY,Best movie ever!! it is dark and intense. Takes place in Madrid. Great acting and musical score. definitely worth your time.,1394668800,,124,4.9523809523809526
8172345,3,B000MTAXRY,No subtitles! I speak decent Spanish but this is difficult to follow without subtitles.  que pena.  it was tough to watch,1389916800,3,121,4.714285714285714
8172346,5,B000MTAXRY,"I like a lot the way the director joins in this film the city of Madrid, the religion, the dark sciences, the heavy metal, the night, the tv shows, and the badness. In a funny comedy",1374710400,,182,4.083333333333333
8172347,3,B000MTAXRY,"Disapointed after favourable recommendations, hard to follow at times. I will have a second go at it just in case I missed something",1356652800,,132,4.782608695652174
8172348,1,B000MTAXRY,"Although it's a NTSC Region 1 disc, there are no English subtitles. Do not buy this unless you happen to speak Spanish fluently.",1317772800,8,128,4.608695652173913
8172349,2,B000MTAXRY,"Rating is for the DVD, and NOT the film.  I figured this would have English subtitles, being region 1.... It doesn't.  DVD is useless to me, since I don't speak Spanish.  I've heard great things about this film, and I love the director's other works. Watch out for ""The Last Circus""... That film rocks.",1309651200,7,302,4.555555555555555
8172350,3,B000MTAXRY,"There are no subtitles at all on this DVD, so if your Spanish isn't good, you might want to get something else.
Otherwise, the DVD is fine.",1307145600,13,139,4.185185185185185
