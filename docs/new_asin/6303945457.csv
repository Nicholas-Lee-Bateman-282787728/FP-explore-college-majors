But, then again you should know that we were talking about CHAD Mcqueen and DON Swayze rather than their ""legitimate actor"" family members. The on-screen duo who have been so often acclaimed in this space deliver the goods once again in this dark horse classic. They play two buddies who basically stumble into millions and act like complete idiots. We suspect much of the script was ad-libbed. Well, except in the film Chad and Don have money.

You won't be disappointed by Money to Burn. It has all the halmarks of what you've come to expect from Chad and Don. There isn't a sleeve in sight, Chad's dialouge is ultra-tough, and Don's facial tick hasn't been cured yet. Thankfully! This film, also known as Squanderers, Gets the full backing of Sid the Elf. It more than earns The Official Sid The Elf Seal of Approval. We couldn't recall laughing this much during a movie since the one the only Death Ring. Also starring Chad McQueen and Don Swayze. Are you starting to see a pattern here? I thought so. Trust us. We were right about Death Ring, we're right about this one.

Please pay special attention to the very very homo erotic scenes where Chad and Don play like 12 year old school boys on a mountain bike and roller blades.  Hillarious! We also must give an honorable mention to a captivating performance by a very well know actor of the B arts, Mr. Joe Estevez.  He has what appears to B a dynatite sound.  We have grown very fond of Joe due to the fact that he appears in 75%of all B movies made.  Straight from Sid the Elf, go check out Money To Burn, and by the end of the week you'll be wearing gold plated diapers.

7857635,5,6303945457,"Money to Burn might be the greatest film I've seen since deat Ring struck video stores everywhere in 1992.  Don McQueen from Gator's Breath, Florida was so right.  This movie was great.  It is a tragedy that great cinema like this doesn't get recognized for such accolades as Oscars.  If the American Film Academy wasn't corrupt, Don Swayze and Chad McQueen would be battling it out for Best Actor every year, and great films such as Death Ring and Money to Burn would be winning in the Best Picture category.  The other reviewer of this film is obviously a man of many wisdoms, and should be acclaimed for his reviewing prowess.  In closing, if you are looking for a great new film to add to your list of favorites, ten Money to Burn is te movie for you.  Once again, this as been Art Vandelay.  Remember, kids, if it isn't B, it isn't me.",985046400,,840,4.409090909090909
7857636,5,6303945457,"Hey folks, D Mcqueen here again to review what may be the best movie ever.  Ever since I saw Death Ring I never thought Don and Chad would ever grace the sscreen again, boy was I wrong.  Don and Chad play two guys who have no job, and sleeep on Don's floor at his grandparents house.  They wind up finding about five million dollars and go on a spending spree, only the way Don and Chad could.  They start buying hot cars and living like kings.  Also theres a special appearence by Joe Estavez.  Yeah I was stunned about it two.  Never was Joe in such great form.  He plays a detective thats hot on the trail of the (should be oscar nominated) Don and Chad.  The movie is all action, and all Swayze and Mcqueen.  Never underestimate Don Swayze.  Once again he gave us amazing acting, along with some of the most moving facial expressions ever to be seen  since the classic ""Death Ring"".  Chad also shows us how great he is by his tough image on screen.  He makes everyone afraid, because he has no boundaries, and is ready to rumble at any given time.  This duo is amazing, and deserves some real credit.  Forget Patrick Swayze and Steve Mcqueen, they've got nothing on Don and Chad.  If you're looking for some real movie acting, and an amazing script, then check out ""Money To Burn.""  Alright folks this is dman signing off from Gator's Breath, Florida.",982972800,2,1355,4.395161290322581
