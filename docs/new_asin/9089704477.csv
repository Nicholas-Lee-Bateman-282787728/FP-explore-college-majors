7901441,5,9089704477,"Four Seasons - Spring is truly a breath of fresh air after a long difficult winter. With feet of snow still on the ground where I live, this DVD is exactly what I needed to cheer me up and remind me that Spring really will come. Technically its Spring now since its almost April, but winter is still all around us. I put this disc in and sat back to watch the absolute beauty of Spring surround me. The still water of the lakes  with the pink sky early in the morning, different kinds of waterfowl, the sounds of the birds - it all combines to ease the soul. Then theres the flowers - ESPECIALLY the tulips - they're so beautiful and captured by excellent photography.  There is also video of lily pads with raindrops sparkling on them like jewels. I almost forgot that Spring hasn't arrived here yet.  Theres a spring film as well as Soothing Scenes and Natural Decoration video on this disc - its all soothing and is so restful and beautiful. My favorite Natural Dcor is the evening lake with its orange/red sky and the sounds of evening at a lake. With everything combined, this video was extremely helpful in sending me to a peaceful, non-snowy place in my mind.  Ill be watching it again.  Well done!",1396051200,,1205,4.4343891402714934
7901442,5,9089704477,It certainly is with this lovely disc. We did not wait for winter to end to play this because it is so cheering to see all this new life when the reality is all a bit damp outside! It is just a gorgeous choice of scenes so well filmed and we loved the sounds as well. I think this could be a really good therapeutic film as well for someone who may not be able to walk any longer for example. Love it!,1388275200,3,401,3.8433734939759034
