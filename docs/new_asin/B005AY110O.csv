8463760,4,B005AY110O,"I consider this one of the better selections from Film Movement.

I found it very insightful.  Set in Czechoslovakia during the 1930's, the Czechs felt safe from German's aggression because a treaty with the Soviet Union and their own preparedness.  Famous and beautiful Hana stars in all the best movies but when the Germans march, her career disappears because she is Jewish.  Meanwhile, Emil, her husband vows to protect her from harm and compromises his ethics as a news reporter to do so.  Surprisingly, this turns out to be the best thing to happen in his career.  Frustrated at her loss of career and then at her husband's sudden rise in popularity with other women and the Germans, she feels betrayed.  Misunderstandings happen on both sides and their confusion fuels fires that no one can handle.

Though one reviewer states these characters as stupid, hindsight is 20/20.  Yes, they make bad decisions, but they did so because they believed that hope was just around the corner.  When circumstances change one doesn't always make the best decisions or realize the immensity or consequences of their choice.  When there are many conflicting voices, who do you chose to believe?

I liked the unique format of the movie.  It provides great insight into how people are selective in what they believe.",1432857600,2,1306,4.935779816513762
8463761,1,B005AY110O,"Marek Najbrt's Protektor is one of the stupidest movies I have seen in a long time.

It is the story of Hana Vrbata, a self-centered Jewish movie starlet, and her husband, Emil Vrbata, a journalist who works as a radio announcer in Prague.

The Nazis occupy Czechslovakia just as shooting is wrapping up on a film Hana is starring in. On older actor who is Jewish understands how dire the situation is and leaves before the Nazis take over.

He warns Hana and gives her documents for her and her husband to escape to Switzerland.

In the first act of monumental stupidity she burns them up. The second act of monumental stupidity occurs when someone, presemubly the older Jewish actor, sends documents to allow Hana and Emil to flee the country, and Emil burns them up.

It all goes downhill from there moving from stupidity to stupidity.

The film has won awards and has been praised for its stylishness etc.

What bunk. If you like your WWII Nazis-hunt-down-Jews movies extra-stupid you will love Protektor.

Otherwise, settle in for Dumb and Dumber. It will be time better spent.",1364342400,,1082,4.748663101604278
8463762,4,B005AY110O,"Stylish film about a Jewish actress who must go into hiding in Nazi occupied Prague in the 30s and her husband, a radio journalist, who gains prominence as a spokesman for the occupiers. Their fortunes, prominence and notoriety reverse; she bridles at her confinement and obscurity, he thrives in the limelight. And then ...

A tense noir drama.",1326326400,4,345,4.948275862068965
