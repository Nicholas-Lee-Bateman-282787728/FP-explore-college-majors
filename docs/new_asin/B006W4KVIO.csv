5022258,2,B006W4KVIO,"Snow is stunned by her father's decision to remarry and she rebels. Some of her choices lead her father to wonder what has gotten into her and her stepmother, wanting to get her out of the house, convinces Daddy that the best solution is to send Snow away to camp. The camp is not the type of place you want to go for the summer, its a discipline camp meant to deal with troublesome teens. snow makes the best of it, but begin to think she's being watched. A series of events lead Snow to think something bad is happening here, and the legend of what happened summers ago leads her to think she might know who is picking off her fellow campers, one by one.

This was one of the movies I should have watched the previews for. By watching it and reading the editorial, I could have seen just how badly the poorly the movie was produced, how badly the lines were going to be delivered, and how cheaply this was made. The editorial breaks the movie down, delivering not only the idea behind it but what is happening at the campground. (not that it is hard to figure out).

The acting in the movie was rigid, even from the seasoned pair hired to play the parents. I really thought that it might be better,considering the actors. Eric Roberts and Maureen McCormick did surprise me a little when I saw them here, it was one of the reasons i rented it in the first place, but they did not help as much as i would have hoped. Their acting seemed stiff and a little rigid and, despite some kind of mean stuff from McCormick, I longed for an Evil Step Mother out of another tale. Shanley Caswell, who I recognized from a few TV roles, did alright in the movie but, like the parents, the lines were delivered poorly and the movie just seemed low quality. The role she had was not good, either, and seemed atypical at best. The campers were even worse, with a montage of people that are hard to root for when the horror starts.

The idea behind the movie seemed aimed at a PG-13 audience, trying to coast the line and deliver a fairy tale that was retold a different way. I actually liked that part of it, the idea itself, thinking the way the main characters came together and the way the stepmother planned on getting rid of her was interesting. This type of modernization seemed interesting, actually, but the way it was pieced together kind of tattered the creativity. If it would have been less rigid and would have made better choices, it could have been at least decently entertaining.

It surprised me to read this cost an estimated 1 million bucks to make because it really did not look like it. Like i said, watch a preview. It'll said you 1 hour 56 minutes. 2/5, saying to pass on it.",1331856000,,2682,4.358
5022259,1,B006W4KVIO,And I paid money for this?  Shame on you for making something so redicously dumb and making us waste money on this junk.,1330646400,3,120,4.217391304347826
5022260,3,B006W4KVIO,"Admittedly this fractured spin of the classic fairy tale is pretty bad but in a campy sort of way.  Director David DeCouteau eschews his usual homo-erotic, bare-chested studs walking in slo-mo wearing tidy-whities for a more standard teen angst storyline.  The script is preposterously crafted leaving no clich&eacute; unturned and the mid-twenties teen cast is lame but there are three performances of dubious note:  Eric Roberts continues to pay for his rehab with another awful turn as the distraught dad; B-movie action star Tim Abell overacts shamelessly as camp director Hunter, but it is BRADY BUNCH alumnus Maureen McCormack as the wicked stepmother who takes hysterics to new levels.  You'll never hear the word ""me"" stretched like this---""it's meeeeeeeeeee!"".  Talullah Bankhead would be proud.  At least the phony blue light lets you see what's going on in the night scenes!
You'll say OH NO at the ridiculous ending and McCormack's final scene...but this is far better than any of DeCouteau's other bombs I give it 3 stars.",1337385600,,1035,5.167664670658683
5022261,1,B006W4KVIO,"The movie had very little to do with Snow White. Snow is the daughter of Eric Roberts and step-daughter of Maureen McCormick and wonders why she is messed up. Snow is sent to a boot camp for wayward teens. Maureen looks into a mirror and has conversations with herself. Sometimes only one set of lips is moving, sometimes both. Years ago, there was a psycho lady at camp who killed someone and was never caught...This one is too hard to figure out maybe Shaggy and Scooby can help.

Snow (Shanley Caswell who needs a new agent) is at camp with eight other teens...EIGHT!...I mean come on, didn't they read the book? At least get something right. The teens are forced to sleep outdoors which leads to them getting killed, although as a slasher film, it stank. Horror-nope. Mystery- nothing to see here folks. Snow does have dreams about a slasher...i.e. a person in a hoodie. And the ending- yeech!

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. My Maureen McCormick fantasies have been crushed. Oh where did I put my copy of ""Texas Lightning?""",1335657600,,1025,4.657458563535911
5022262,1,B006W4KVIO,"This is a cheaply made, terrible movie full of bad acting, poor sound and picture quality, and a script that was sporadic at best. The whole Snow White name had nothing to do with the movie. I only watched the whole thing because I was entertained talking crap the whole time.",1335571200,,276,4.431372549019608
5022263,2,B006W4KVIO,"One of the worst and most boring and disconnected movies I've ever seen.  The only reason I watched the whole thing was that I kept waiting for something interesting to happen!  Now, how boring is MY life?  Very dull and extremely uninteresting with really poor acting.  If there was a way Amazon would accept return of a REALLY bad movie, this would be one they'd get back.",1335312000,,374,4.537313432835821
5022264,1,B006W4KVIO,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The actors are trying to ""act"", the music is old horror movie when nothing is going on and it looks like its filmed with the cheapest camera known to man kind. The whole time they try to set you up for horror but nothing really happens. Not worth your time and definitely not worth your money.",1334448000,4,342,4.119402985074627
5022265,1,B006W4KVIO,"Wow! This is what happens when your career is over and you're trying to make your SAG insurance. Maureen McCormick and Eric Roberts sadly fall into that group. They only appear in about 10 minutes of the film. Maureen hasn't aged well and looks closer to 65 than 55. Eric, who had a promising career has ended up at rock bottom. This movie isn't good enough to be aired on SciFi or Chiller TV. The budget for this film must have been about $5.00. There were no sets or costumes. The script was written by someone in 5th grade. Don't waste your time or money. Enjoy Maureen when she was Marcia Brady. That was the pinnacle of her career.",1333324800,4,636,4.352941176470588
5022266,1,B006W4KVIO,"Mediocre acting at best, a production budget in the neighborhood of fifty dollars, a silly script, and wacky music at the most inappropriate moments.  How on earth do movies like this even get made?",1332633600,2,198,4.823529411764706
5022267,1,B006W4KVIO,"Classic psychologically weak rich dad, mean stepmom, as perceived by angry irresponsible and annoying teen daughter. Mean step mom likes to talk to her alter self in the mirror. Both stepmom and daughter want to establish a closer relationship with the dad and both see the other as being in the way. Mom talks dad into forcibly sending daughter off to an isolated, month long, wilderness camp for correcting troubling youth behaviors. Campers go missing and then dying (not shown) and of course the camp has some history which one of the campers in the latest information age hook discovered on wiki.

Problems:
(1.) DVD cover has nothing to do with movie. False advertising. Cheap production cost saving of no subtitles for hearing impaired or to substitute for poor audio.
(2.) Way over the top, not believable if not laughable, character portrayal. The military boot camp image of a whistle blowing, hard nose, do push ups and jumping jacks 'til you drop camp commander just doesn't happen except in movies. Wilderness camps actually do a lot of journaling, discussion groups, wilderness hiking with individual camp set up responsibilities. It's highly choreographed, staged and closely monitored.
(3.) Half the movie (45 minutes) were just four scenes repeated over and over. The same moon position with the exact same clouds passing it was shown repeatedly throughout the movie. Poor clouds they must have felt like bored actors when asked to repeat a scene over and over again. Then there were all the scenes of totem poles, shot close up, as if they had some significance. Never panned out. Lots of scenes of some lake. Also never meant anything other than a cheap time filler. Finally, were the cheap to produce constant flashbacks.
(4.) The supposed night scenes were so cheaply filtered day light scenes that you could clearly see strong shadows.
(5.) Overbearing background sounds to create drama when poor script and acting can't get it done. Annoying were the too loud and boring same limited piano notes and other sounds. Just too distracting.
(6.) The conclusion that all the participants were part of a dream was cutesy unconvincing cheap ending.",1332547200,12,2163,5.025069637883008
5022268,1,B006W4KVIO,"This has to have been the worst movie I've ever seen.  The production was bad- you can see where they reused the same shots again and again.  The storyline had so many holes, just horrible.  Characters were cliche and the acting bad, bad, bad.  I can't believe we wasted our time and money on this one!",1332115200,5,302,4.339285714285714
5022269,2,B006W4KVIO,"""25 years ago a camper was killed, the person who did it disappeared never to be seen or heard from again.""  A girl named Snow (not kidding) is sent to a discipline camp by her evil step mother (McCormack) because she thinks she is trying to break up her and her day (also not kidding).  While there Snow begins to notice strange happenings and uncovers a hidden secret about the camp.  This is a movie very much geared toward younger high school girls so that may be a reason I didn't really like it. The movie is very cheesy and low budget and you can really tell. A girl gets killed by a necklace she is wearing and there is no blood (still not kidding).  The best thing I can say about this is that it is kinda cool to see Marcia Brady in a role like this. Overall, not very good but it is kinda entertaining for a while. The ending is so dumb though it makes you regret watching it. I give it a D+.",1331856000,,903,4.084745762711864
8505372,1,B006W4KVIO,"If I could give a 0 star review I would. This movie was laughable! It's hard to look past Maureen McCormick's past of playing a sweet girl on the Brady Bunch to a ""wicked stepmother"" in this movie. Her acting was hideous. The movie's make up artists lacked in putting some makeup on her face too. The cover of the movie shows ""Snow White"" (the girl's name is actually ""Snow""), holding an apple...there's absolutely no poisoned apple in the movie whatsoever. The plot of the movie was dumb too. I was going to buy it but decided to rent it just to see what all the horrible fuss of bad reviews was all about from others who've watched it. I'm glad I didn't buy it.",1462060800,,663,4.312
8505373,5,B006W4KVIO,Nice deviation of the classic story. I liked Maureen McCormick in this film also.,1458000000,,81,4.857142857142857

8505376,5,B006W4KVIO,I love this movie. I've seen it about 10 times and it hasn't gotten old. This movie is very mysterious and suspenseful. I suggest watching it! I don't know what the other reviews are talking about n,1395964800,,198,4.378378378378378
8505377,1,B006W4KVIO,I could not get through the movie on the first (and only viewing) so far. Terrible acting is what killed it for me and my kids make fun of me for sitting through some really crappy movies. Do not buy or rent this movie unless you are in some sort of contest.,1392422400,,258,3.980769230769231
8505378,4,B006W4KVIO,Good plot with a lot of twists and turns. I only knew Maureen Mccormick from the cast but was impressed with all the new actors and actresses. Not for children. PG13 in my opinion.,1378512000,,180,4.323529411764706

8505380,1,B006W4KVIO,"This is a bad low budget movie. So bad that its just bad. Everything from the wooden acting and terrible lighting to the characters with no personality, emotion, charm or flair. You'd expect this is some sort of high school project, but no its just a failed attempt to cash in on the Snow White name. Picking on this movie is just far too easy. Its one of those movies that you'll want to shut it off in the first five minutes and if you withstand it to the end it will slap you in the face with its ending. Even the camera angles seem off and very strange. Sometimes the camera angle doesn't change for a for a few minutes and that just seems lazy.

I was expecting this to be some modernization of the classic tale where Snow White is the daughter of a rich businessman or mayor and Snow's new step mother would kill him and she'd go off on a quest to stop her. Alas, this movie is totally different where a rich girl is sent off to a summer camp for troubled youths. Instead of 'sent away' I should have said taken away by force. She wakes up with 2 men that have come for her and take her away kind of against her will to the summer camp. I say kind of against her will, because she doesn't really fight it. When she arrives at the camp and meets the headmaster he tells her the several reasons she's there, one of which was grand theft auto when she didn't actually steal the car, nor did she stick up for herself. She was just okay with it. That's a major problem I have with this movie, everyone is okay with the flawed logic, no one really questions anything. No one tries to escape at least to a telephone to tell someone I've been kidnapped and put in some summer camp!

Eventually the other campers start dying. Lamely dying. There's no sense of dread or suspense. People are just found dead or someone says they're dead and you never actually see it. Each of the campers is so dull and uninspiring its just like a placeholder will no longer be on screen.

Please avoid this cash in.",1358553600,,1994,4.228346456692913
8505381,1,B006W4KVIO,"Slow, boring, wooden acting, confusing complicated laughable storyline. Its hard to believe this is a film. Its just a copy of similar films done badly. Nothing to do with Snowwhite but an attempt to draw attention to the film. Predictable from start to finish.",1339545600,,261,4.954545454545454
