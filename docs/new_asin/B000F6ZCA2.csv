8118343,5,B000F6ZCA2,"One of the best Biographies I have read.  I now understand why Nimitz was chosen and how he made such a difference to how the war in the Pacific was waged.  His leadership skills shine through with his ability to keep his cool and bring many different branches, militaries, and allies together to get the mission completed; which is to defeat the enemy and bring our boys home.  Outstanding read!",1429747200,,396,4.628571428571429
8118344,5,B000F6ZCA2,The movie took a while to arrive but I watched it as soon as I got it and have  already watched it twice more.  A great documentary of one of the great leaders of WWII.  Highly recommended if you love Navy history.,1429315200,,214,4.0476190476190474

8118346,4,B000F6ZCA2,A great DVD for those interested in WWII or naval history in general. The DVD presents a lot of detail in the life of the man responsible for the execution of the Pacific campaign in WWII.,1360108800,,188,4.25
8118347,3,B000F6ZCA2,"If you want a quickie about a great and inspiring man, this DVD is fine. If you have already read any of the biographies or substantial histories, this is very superficial. Not that I didn't learn anything, but at less than an hour, I was disappointed. He never even speaks.

Having said this, if you don't know much about Chester Nimitz, watch the DVD and then read the books. He was a great man in all respects.",1175731200,2,413,4.363636363636363
