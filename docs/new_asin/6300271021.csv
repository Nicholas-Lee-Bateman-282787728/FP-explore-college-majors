7808130,5,6300271021,"great lost comedy, would love for this to be on DVD, Warren Oates is very funny, Telly is shifty and Caesar Romero is well Caesar Romero",1507680000,,136,4.269230769230769
7808131,4,6300271021,"Both Telly and Warren appear to be thoroughly enjoying themselves (not so as to be detrimental to the film) as engaging con men who become fond of their intended victims on a large English estate.  Highlight of the film is
Telly attempting to dissuade the union-bound house breakers by going over the estate's (non-existent) security system, and thereby ""keep casualties to a minimum"".  A surprisingly entertaining film.",1374105600,,420,5.253731343283582
7808132,5,6300271021,"Crooks and Coronets is a sleeper - an unknown but quite nicely done comedy with a heart. The story is a blend of Robin and the Seven Hoods, Pocketful of Miracles, and Fitzwilly with a touch of Home Alone. Telly Savalas is actually quite funny as he changes from bad guy to good guy. But then again, I am a sucker for stories of redemption.",1103328000,6,339,4.230769230769231
