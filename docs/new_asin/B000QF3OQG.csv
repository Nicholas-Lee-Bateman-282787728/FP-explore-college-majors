8195883,5,B000QF3OQG,"This is one serious workout.  The entire workout is 90 minutes, but the meat of it can be done in the first hour.  You can pace yourself by doing what you can, with the people in the studio showing you what is possible after doing the training.  This is my favorite workout in the P90X series, and I would recommend the whole series, as the DVDs provide a lot of variety to keep you from getting bored.",1295913600,,402,4.194805194805195
8195884,1,B000QF3OQG,"I purchased this product not realizing that it wasn't what I had originally thought. I was thinking that it was the entire P90X program. When I realized that I had only purchased one of the 12 discs I quickly emailed the seller and cancelled the shipment. This was done within a day of my order placement. I had paid for the product via paypal, and still have yet to be reinbursed. I recently contacted the seller again, and have received no response.",1288396800,2,451,4.512195121951219
