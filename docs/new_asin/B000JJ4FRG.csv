8150512,5,B000JJ4FRG,"This is a very good movie - the characters were portrayed well by the actors.  Not a feel good movie, but one that makes one think and act on the injustice that still exists in our world.",1298937600,,187,4.054054054054054
8150513,4,B000JJ4FRG,"I really enjoyed it.  There was elements that reminded me of Ang Lee's The Ice-Storm, not as bleak though.  I thought overall it was honest and addressed some serious issues.  There was a lot going on with all the characters and I would of loved to see this movie be longer to really divulge all that was going on in their heads.  Overall if you like heavy themes expressed subtly and complex latent characters, this movie may deliver for you.",1269734400,5,443,4.5
8150514,2,B000JJ4FRG,I thought this movie was horrible. The only salvation for the movie was Hayden Panettiere's acting skills. Her Looks don't hurt either. I would not  buy it because of that. T he gay sex scene was absolutely horrible.,1265587200,2,216,4.684210526315789
8150515,1,B000JJ4FRG,"this movie was one of the most depressing I have seen in 10 years. The DVD jacket could be called ""bait and switch"". nothing was said about the lack of dimension of the characters. If looking for a good movie along this type that truly is a character study try ""Ordinary People"".",1210464000,2,279,4.384615384615385
8150516,2,B000JJ4FRG,"Absolutely zero benefit from Blu-Ray on a movie like this, not to mention this movie just flat out stinks.  I am all about the serious drama, but this was the serious sleeper, as in I could not stay awake...",1190937600,3,207,4.3076923076923075
8150517,4,B000JJ4FRG,"THE ARCHITECT is a film based on a play by David Grieg that deals with social class dichotomy, lack of communication in families, gender confrontations in youths, and coming to grips with decisions of the past that later haunt.  Made on a budget less than a million dollars and shot in twenty days, this unique little movie packs a wallop in the most secretive and subtle way.  Directed by Matt Tauber, who also wrote the screenplay with Grieg, it has a fascinating, if at times disconcerting, format of quick scenes flashed before our eyes like simultaneous conversations - and some of the power of the film is piecing those snapshots together as the film ends.

Leo Waters (Anthony LaPaglia) is a successful architect, married to a wife Julia (Isabella Rossellini) who seems on the edge of mental instability. They have two teenage children - Christine (a very fine young actress Hayden Panettiere) who at age 15 is aware of her body and yet fearful of its implications in her interactions with boys and men, and Martin (Sebastian Stan) who has returned home from school as a drop out whose mind is preoccupied with soul searching.  The discord at home is matched by the incipient calamity ongoing at a Project Leo designed early in his career, a Project now physically crumbling under the weight of drug dealing, crime, and discontent tenants - all led by activist Tonya Neeley (the superb actress Viola Davis) who has one daughter at home with an early conceived baby and another daughter who has stepped out of the Projects to better her education (her twin brother committed suicide in despair of his plight in the Projects).  Two families in conflict over different reasons on the surface but sharing a similarity that is demonstrated as the story proceeds.

Christina naively begins to frequent bars and is protected by a truck driver Joe (the very fine actor Walton Goggins) who kindly introduces her to the realities facing hormonally charged yet fearful young girls.  Martin, in an attempt to understand the Projects problem as explained to his father and family by Tonya, visits the Projects and meets Shawn (the very fine and handsome young actor Paul James) who cautiously helps Martin discover his sexuality only to succeed in allowing Martin to discover his true sexual proclivity but meets a sad ending when he is rebuffed.

At the peak of tensions Tonya succeeds in winning over Leo's understanding of her activist dilemma, Julia breaks and leaves her family and both of Leo's children discover life lessons that will imprint their psyches permanently.  Minor victories rise out of major turmoil - and the writer and director have the courage to leave the story for us to resolve.

It is refreshing to encounter a cast of actors so sensitive as this one.  From the leading roles to the most minor of characters the acting is absolutely first rate.  We need more films of this caliber to remind us that one of the purposes of art is to allow us to see the problems of our world.  Highly recommended.
