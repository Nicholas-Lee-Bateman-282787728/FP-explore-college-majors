5559370,1,B00B5DWF18,"This DVD is a sham. A mockery of a sham. A sham of a mockery.

This is, here it is, a BBC ancient Macbeth from the 70s/80s. I have two complete sets of Shakespeare's plays

by the BBC. This is beyond retredding. This is retarding. The biographies of the playwrights are about a paragraph or two. Wikipedia dwarfs this rip-off biography on Thomas Middleton, glorified by the Chaste Maid of Cheapside that was not mentioned in his corpus. Did not check others for their accomplishments that would not be listed.

Then the great James Barton comes into the fray or is that the flay of intelligence with programs on acting Shakespeare.

Mr. Barton is a wit, scholar and one if the most knowledgeable people on Earth regarding the ifs, and buts of the Bard. I have his complete series bought from Amazon.

This compendium is a disgrace, an effrontery to honest presentation.",1365984000,14,869,4.690789473684211
5559371,5,B00B5DWF18,"A general audience enlightenment of Shakespeare in the Jacobean era. This is the time that produced the King James Bible translation (1611). Primarily narration; the documentary incorporates interviews, paintings, documents, play excerpts, and architecture offering more than an introduction to Shakespeare--but also beginner relevant.

SDH SUBTITLES optional for all episodes.
Episode 1- Incertainties: Monarch changes, religious fervor, period incertainties [Shakespearean word no longer in use] drive the arts to new heights including Shakespeare and his theatre, popular media of the age. 1603 brought a dying Queen and theatre closings... Then the unpredictable King of Scots reigns. King James I. He banned Sunday theatre but also named Shakespeare's Company as his own ""The King's Players."" Shakespeare became ""The King's Man."" Plague followed. Theatre called Jacobean sin.
""Oh Lear, Lear, Lear!"" -WS (William Shakespeare)

2- Equivocation: Shakespeare authors art of double meanings. The episode's title was a new word exposing lying, deceit--a new dark age (1606) exploited by Shakespeare. It produced Nov 5- Guy Fawkes Day. ""Macbeth"" tragedy sums up the times, ""who committed treason enough for God's sake but could not equivocate to heaven. O! come in, equivocator."" -WS
It was a time of high spectacle. A new flag (Union Jack), symbol of a united ""Great"" Britain. Alas, King James was not loved. ""Anthony & Cleopatra""-- ""Be a child of the time."" -WS. Octavius represented King James.
Shakespeare's economic investment trap leads to his last tragedy,""Coriolanus.""
""That's a brave fellow; But he's vengeance proud, and loves not the common people."" -WS

3- Legacy: 1610 ""A Winter's Tale"" ""A sad tale's best for winter..."" -WS. It addressed monarchy court shame and chaos. It's the story of a legacy assured.
Then ""The Tempest"" was inspired by a real shipwreck heading for Jamestown in America, only reaching Bermuda. The island politics within the play, and musical accompaniment, reflected the dynastic ambition of King James. Lastly, ""Henry VIII"", a huge statement about monarchy legacy--one not complimentary, but offered hope in the end. It was ""The King's Man"", Shakespeare who achieves the legacy.

This documentary makes even a new student of Shakespeare want to read or watch. Forsooth, the bonus disc is a 2  hr ""Macbeth"" BBC production, 1982, color, subtitled, and staring Nicol Williamson as Macbeth, and Jane Lapotaire as Lady Macbeth.
A good DVD to add to any Shakespeare library.

8562879,4,B00B5DWF18,"Professor James Shapiro has done the seemingly impossible and found a new light to shed on the life of William Shakespeare and his later plays. Although he makes a few assumptions here and there, (as when he says, most convincingly, that Shakespeare did such and such a thing at such and such a place), his opinion is nonetheless well-informed and his theories, for the most part, are impressively believable. We must remember though that Shakespeares actual life and career is very poorly documented, and while it is tempting to place the worlds greatest playwright in any number of circumstances, there is nothing to actually prove these imaginings.

Im willing to concede many of Shapiros major surmises, however, such as how events of the day may have impacted Shakespeares writings, for they mostly make perfect sense; but one must view this program with just a pinch of salt, at least when it comes to Shakespeares biography.

But the plays the thing, is it not? And Shapiros knowledge of the time and key events in the reign of King James I is the real meat of the story, drawing us in with a fresh perspective on Shakespeares works that has rarely, if ever, (to my knowledge) been considered before.

And that consideration is Shakespeare as Jacobean playwright (meaning he wrote during the reign of King James) as opposed to being solely a product of the Elizabethan era, which many people assume. As Shapiro delves deep into the events and changes of the time, the significance of this discovery becomes fascinatingly apparent.

This is the ultimate value of this outstanding three episode series: how it provides new insight into some of the most important plays in world literature. Not an easy task.

While he isn't the most absorbing on-camera host in an Athena-released documentary (Shapiros readings tend to over-emphasize key words which has the effect of sounding like Captain Kirk got an education), this is truly a fine example of content over style carrying the program. Many of Shapiros conclusions and observations are truly ground-breaking. And even with some mediocre performances of scenes from Shakespeares later plays (was the RSC slumming  especially their horribly-performed bits from King Lear?), the layer upon layer of significant observations about Shakespeare as a Jacobean author pile up so high that the cumulative effect is that of a significant contribution to Shakespearean scholarship. (Bits from Ralph Fiennes recent film of Coriolanus make up for some of the shoddy stage excerpts, so that helps, too).

As a very special bonus feature is an outstanding (for the most part) production of Macbeth from 1983, part of the BBC Shakespeare series that ambitiously presented all of Shakespeares plays produced for television from the late seventies to the early nineteen-eighties. Nicol Williamson is in fine form as Macbeth and the shamefully little-known (in North America) Jane Lapotaire explodes in a technically astounding performance as Lady Macbeth. Note how she ascends several staircases without looking down, as one small example of her powerhouse technique.

This two disc set from Athena is a keeper, something every fan of Shakespeare simply must own. Despite a few false notes, it is truly impressive and bound to set you thinking about some of Shakespeares late masterpieces in a new way.",1397433600,7,3340,5.138121546961326
8562880,4,B00B5DWF18,"I purchased this DVD after I had seen some of this program on UK TV.  I liked it so much I wanted to see it again.  I love the documentary, and am a fan of James Shapiro.  I have not watched the included films (of Shakespeare's plays, so cannot comment on those.)",1394582400,,263,4.019230769230769
8562881,5,B00B5DWF18,"If you're at all interested in Shakespeare's relation to his times, particularly the ways he may have drawn inspiration from the social and political currents that swirled about him, you will likely find this an insightful and valuable documentary series.  As Shapiro says in the first episode, his earlier book, ""1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare"", was very much about the Elizabethan Shakespeare, which caused him to want to put the focus in these three one-hour programs on the Shakespeare of the following Jacobean era to round out the picture.  Covering pretty much the entirety of James I's reign, the series looks principally at ""Measure for Measure"", ""King Lear"", ""Timon of Athens"",  ""Macbeth"", ""Antony and Cleopatra"", ""The Winter's Tale"", ""The Tempest"", and ""Henry VIII"". Each play is examined in terms of how it may be related to events, personages, tensions, and dynamics in the realm(s) of James I - and it's fascinating stuff.  One measure by which an enterprise of this nature might be judged is not so much whether some new piece of evidence has been discovered, but how well the programs draw into focus a myriad of considerations - textual, performative, biographical, political, sociological, and so on - in giving the viewer an accessible but integrated understanding of a wide range of material.  It takes a master to do all that and Shapiro delivers.

Of course it's a challenge what the camera will actually photograph in telling a story like this one, 400 years after the events under consideration.  While each of us might quibble here or there with what has been chosen for the camera's eye, still, on balance, a hugely interesting array of paintings, maps, documents, building interiors and modern-day `neighborhood' views of where events took place long ago, is brought before our eyes.  How many of us would ever be able to view, on our own, the vast majority of the rare books and documents shown - and even all of the more readily available paintings and street locations - which the programs bring before us?  To have a look at all this, especially the rare materials, contextualized, is one of the real pleasures of the series - as are the interviews with museum curators, theatre practitioners, and other experts, throughout the three programs.

The dvd package contains a ""bonus"" disc of the 1982 ""Macbeth"" with Nicol Williamson and Jane Lapotaire made for the BBC.  It's a curious version to have offered.  Time has not been particularly kind to this version, especially in terms of the art direction (the sets are very much of their early 1980s television vintage and look laughably cardboard-like to today's eye).  It's unfortunate that the bonus could not have been the Ian McKellan-Judi Dench version of slightly earlier vintage (directed by Trevor Nunn for the RSC), which has attained near classic status for its stripped down staging approach and close focus on the intense acting - that would have made a fine ""bonus"" to Shapiro's three programs.  But, no matter, that much-admired version is otherwise available (including on Amazon), and the rather odd ""bonus"" selection provided shouldn't stand in the way if the series is otherwise of interest to you.  (The instant-video version, also available on Amazon, is, by the way, the three programs of the documentary series only.)

Highly recommended.",1376524800,9,3356,5.030685920577618
8562882,1,B00B5DWF18,"Coming from James Shapiro, who wrote the excellent book about Shakespeare, 1599, this video is a big let-down. Nothing new here, and nothing that really adds anything to our understanding of Shakespeare or his life in Jacobean England. It's a lot of Shapiro pontificating about nothing or interviewing people who seem to have nothing new or noteworthy to offer, interspersed with speeded-up images of modern day London. A big blah. The second disc is a video of a 1970s production of MacBeth that is not particularly interesting. Don't waste your money.",1376352000,8,553,5.087912087912088

8562884,1,B00B5DWF18,"Since the dating of the plays is entirely without factual foundation, since, for example, the play Macbeth contains at least one allusion to an event of 1583-4, and was most certainly written well before 1600, what Shapiro ""reveals"" is ""a Shakespeare"" who never existed.  Fiction presented as history deserves no stars.",1369267200,7,319,5.254901960784314
