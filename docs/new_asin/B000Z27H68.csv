8234589,5,B000Z27H68,what a difficult experience  to go through(because of the subject matter) the film is extraordinary! Bravo for the director!,1406851200,,124,5.526315789473684
8234590,4,B000Z27H68,"""9 Star Hotel"" (2007 release from Israel; 78 min.) is a documentary about a group of young Palestine construction workers, crossing the border into Israeli illegally so as to work at various construction sites in the Israeli city of Modi'in. As the documentary opens, we follow these men as they nervously venture into Israel, afraid of running into the Border Patrol or the Israeli police. We see them crossing a busy highway (I couldn't help but think back of a similar scene many years ago when I was driving on the I-5 in San Diego). Most importantly, we get to know them as human beings. After the daily work is done, these guys are hanging out and they talk about missing their friends and family back in Palestine, discuss how to possibly make more money in Israel, and yes, even the beautiful women in Israel (comments one of them: ""Did you see the Israeli Border Patrol? It was a woman."" His friend asks: ""Was she pretty?"" His response: ""They all are!"", ha!). No, these are not terrorists, but simply a desperate group of men who will do whatever it takes to make some money so they can support their families. The movie does not take a political stand in favor or against these ""undocumented workers"", as it's called these days I think.

Couple of further thoughts: this is a rather short movie, so make sure to check out the DVD bonus materials, which include an excellent 10 min. interview with the Israeli director, Ido Haar, who brings some nice insights on why he made this documentary, and what it was like to make this movie. For one, as it turns out, Haar does not speak any Arabic, so he would only after the fact (in the editing room) learn what the Palestine men were talking about! Second, this movie premiered in the US at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival, and was very well received by the critics. This was my second time seeing it (it's been maybe 5 years when I saw it first), and it hasn't lost any of its powerful impact. Last, I had the good fortune of visiting Israel a few years back, and I can only second the comments made by the Palestine guys: yes, Israeli women are (generally speaking) quite gorgeous!

Bottom line: ""9 Star Hotel"" is a moving documentary that contributes from a more human angle to the never-ending debate on the Israeli-Palestine conflict. ""9 Star Hotel"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1389139200,,2331,4.600961538461538
8234591,3,B000Z27H68,"As one who teaches the history of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, I recommend this film to my students. But is it entirely honest to advertise it as a 'documentary'? The film is billed as viewing Palestinians off-camera, although the men seem often to talk to the camera, as of course they would in the circumstances. They self-consciously direct their 'private' conversations to the ever-present camera. More useful might have been actual interviews with them about their plight, and less on the chit-chat, which consumes much of the overly long 78 minutes. After all, the audience wants to know their opinions, not their play-acting abilities. Oddly the film omits the all-important CONTEXT: the Al-Aqsa Intifada.
I hope Haar will do another film on the same theme, with less of the so-called dialogues.",1291334400,2,800,5.161538461538462
8234592,2,B000Z27H68,"A sympathetic view of a band of Arab laborers who are undergoing a good deal of economic distress as their underground jobs in Israel begin to dry up.  Interesting points of view regarding their family backgrounds, comradeship and feelings about mideast politics. On the other hand, it's not a film you'd really go out of your way to see.

8234593,5,B000Z27H68,"Excellent production. I wish we had more producer/directors like like giving different views.
I recommend this highly. I purchased my own to show friends.
It takes an open mind!",1218153600,,177,5.137931034482759
8234594,3,B000Z27H68,"Though compelling story about the horrible conditions that some Palestinian workers must endure in order to make a living, I found the movie too long and too one sided.",1214697600,,168,4.827586206896552
8234595,5,B000Z27H68,"What can I say about this amazing documentary? Only that it will open your eyes to the struggles of others. The thought of what these men have to go through to find work is amazing. The similarities between the border issues we face in the United States can be easily related to the issues faced in this extraordinary documentary.

Kudos to Ido Haar and KOCH Lorber for bringing this amazing documentary to the public",1203379200,,417,4.635135135135135
8234596,5,B000Z27H68,"When I chanced upon ""9 Star"" at Tribecca I was taken aback by its story. It's one of plight and struggle, filmed in what I would call 'real terms' (the use of handheld cameras to not only permit the filming, but to further the 'reality of it all' stylistically). Now, having seen it, I stop instantly with each and every news story about what's going on in the region. The breached border in Gaza, the thousands of people struggling to create a life for themselves against odds that are nearly impossible. 9 Star really opened my eyes in a way only a film can to an ordeal being faced and a reality that is not easy for anyone.

While the 'real' story is newsworthy in and of itself, 9 Star also contains a storyline about friendship and loyalty and family and 'what it takes' to survive.

Interestingly, in an entirely different way, another recent film from the region had similar imapct for me. Syrian Bride, the story of a planned-marriage-against-the odds, also carries incredible impact. Built in reverse to 9 Star (a narrative fiction approach), Syrian Bride's topline story is one of union, but its underlying message is one of struggle-against-the-odds. I cannot help but wonder why this region of the world cannot simply get it together.

In a world where most films deal with nothing other than entertainment, both 9 Star Hotel and Syrian Bride bring to light daring stories that provoke thought and enlightenment.

Cheers to KOCH Lorber for having enough bravado to release such incredible quality works to the market.",1202428800,5,1530,4.806083650190114
8234597,5,B000Z27H68,Had the pleasure of seeing this moving documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival and hear the director Ido Haar answer a few questions about the making of the film after it screened. Thrilled to see that it has been released on DVD and will be exposed to a wider audience. It opened my eyes to an issue that I never knew existed - the plight of migrant Palestinian workers crossing into Israel - a situation not dissimilar to the one that exists on the U.S. and Mexican border.,1202342400,4,476,4.420454545454546
8234598,5,B000Z27H68,"When I first saw this documentary I could not believe the ordeal the Palestinian men dealt with, risking their lives crossing the Israeli border to find work. But despite the raw sadness you feel watching their struggle for survival, the story ultimately is about the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity. An excellent film by Ido Haar.",1202342400,7,347,4.898305084745763
