Movies you truly have to see to believe. I advise to go in to this knowing as little about it as possible, the ending will truly shock you (some in a good way, some bad). To truly enjoy this movie I say you go into it not expecting to see the typical three act structure but to see evidence from a horrific true crime. It truly feels like you're watching real evidence at times. Release this movie a decade ago and the makers would be arrested is how real this film looks/feels at some points. That's why I loved this and that's what I think the filmmakers were going for. My jaw was literally down the entire finale that footage was so raw.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is far from perfect, but for what it was going for it hits all the right marks. It's raw, unsettling, sticks with you, puts you right there in the moment, and makes it feel real-- exactly how found footage films should be.

Highly recommend for anyone who:
-loves found footage
-loves true crime
-loves gore
-loves college movies
-is a feminist
-is a misogynist that needs to be cured
-wants to see something out of the ordinary and original",1449446400,,1353,4.28125
8652471,2,B00JMOJRXG,"I was going to go one star but seeing as how this movie confused the daylights out of me...I gave it credit for that. Did this actually happen? I don't know. could it have, doubtful. A fraternity and a sorority compete every Halloween to see who scares who the most and who cries for help first. Strike one...it was filmed in that handheld camera point of view, very bouncy. Strike two, so dark and the camera angles are just all wrong. Strike three, I did not care for any of the males or females at all, just the dog. The Frat bros and sorority girls were all shallow, vain and self important. At the end they gave a body count? Still don't believe it. Nothing of any value here. 2 stars, 1 for the cute dog and 1 for the shirtless guys briefly at the start. Very briefly.",1415491200,,774,4.236486486486487
8652472,5,B00JMOJRXG,Definitely a must see! This is a moral tale that all incoming college freshmen should watch about what could happen at a Frat/Sorority party if you're not careful. Think Cannibal Holocaust meets Spring Breakers. The camera work alone should be viewed for its experimentation. You really feel like you're in the throes of a drug induced frenzy. Can't wait for FACE II.,1412985600,,367,4.935483870967742
8652473,4,B00JMOJRXG,"I watched this film with an open mind since a friend of mine told me about it. They didn't tell me what
to expect so I was fresh eager and willing to get my senses violated and that's exactly what happened!
I especially liked the way that it was shot, it felt different than most of the horror genre that I enjoy watching.
If you're a big guy like me, don't feel ashamed if you find yourself covering your eyes at a crucial point in
the film, trust me I won't blame you.",1412121600,,470,4.064516129032258
8652474,4,B00JMOJRXG,"this is a weird movie that has some very cool moments, made me feel uneasy.  the two perspectives thing was cool and the music was interesting.  i wish there were more scenes with the dog.  if you think frat guys are the worst, you'll love this movie.  my friend had a copy of it and i borrowed it cuz of (i'll admit it) the V/H/S thing, and honestly i thought it would be worse, but it was actually entertaining and twisted, worth a watch for sure.",1412035200,,449,4.186046511627907

Ok so the reviews on this movie are fresh so it's possible they were just in the moment. This film is utter garbage. The story is scattered, the characters are not developed, and most of all the plot comes out of no where. This film is pure shock in it's climax only for the sake of it. There isn't any evidence that should be shown to prove satanic occult and the whole revenge is non nonsensical. It isn't scary, it's just crude. Basically it makes no sense as a found footage film because it uses two cameras instead of one and while it has soooo much possibility to be a an amazing film it just doesn't work because of the lack of writing leading up to it. Essentially if you like found footage films that feel like snuff films but don't make any sense, you will love it. If you are looking to simply be shocked, same thing. Basically though the film waste almost a full hour before it 'begins' if you know what I mean. I'm saying pass but if you think you must watch it, do not say I warned you. I truly also wish Amazon would have this on instant because buying this trash was a mistake. If it wasn't from the producers of V/H/S I would have passed on it. They're an amazing production company but they do a movie like V/H/S with 'shorts' for a reason. It's shows in this film.",1410307200,,1312,4.252

8652477,5,B00JMOJRXG,"I love horror films.  Most horror films suuuuck.  Great horror stays with you forever.  Exorcist, Rosemarie's Baby, Saw, Evil Dead, Original Elm Street, Child's Play, these films tap into something raw and primal.  Exorcist is about God.  Rosemarie is about the control of the female body.  Saw is about sacrifice.  This new film, which I was fortunate to see last December at a horror festival in San Francisco is about masculinity.  It's a disturbing f-ing film about the reckless excess of being manly.  The plot: a Halloween party where girls and boys try to scare each other.  Like in Rashomon, we see both versions.  The boy's version first.  Then, the girls.  The boy's part is your standard fare (like every horror movie out there), almost as if the directors wanted to reminded you what you're used to.  The girl's part is like nothing you've ever seen in a horror movie.  If you're a man, it will make you sick.  You will never forget it.  If you're a woman, and you like your horror films bloody, this could be the horror show you've always fantasize about.  I don't think ""Face"" is a great film.  But in five years, when I get over it, I might.",1398211200,2,1156,4.578431372549019
