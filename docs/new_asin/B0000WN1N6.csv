1958035,4,B0000WN1N6,"This movie starts very slowly, but picks up momentum fast.

It is a clear and even moving account of Daniel Ellsberg, and his transformation from a gung-ho military analyst to the foremost opponent of the Vietnam War.

It does a great job in making his evolution believable.

The acting is good.  James Spader is robotic, but that's appropriate to Ellsberg himself.  Paul Giamatti is great as his also-evolving colleague.  Claire Forlani begins better than she ends; toward the end of the movie she seems to be simply going through the motions--her performance lacks fire and sincerity.  The woman who plays Ellsberg's first wife, however, is sensational.

Several nice touches:

The quick cuts between historical footage and what is happening in the film are seamless and powerful.

The scenes in Vietnam are a revelation.

The take on Nixon's thugs (Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell) is astonishing.

An informative, powerful film.",1297900800,7,931,5.258503401360544

For those of us who watched with jaws dropped as Congress voted nearly unanimously to support the war, the movie brings back in vivid detail the times from the late 60's.  I appreciate that it brought out the personal inner turmoil of a man who was initially a ""hawk"" (because he felt that Communism must be stopped), but who became convinced that the Viet Nam War was wrong and that he needed to do something to stop it, even at the risk of being tried for treason.

Having lived in Washington throughout the entire Watergate affair, leaving a week or two after Nixon, I really appreciate the delicious irony of the fact that Nixon was so anxious to discredit Ellsburg that he had his ""Watergate Burglers"" break into Ellsburg's psychiatrist office and steal his file.  It was this contamination of due process that resulted in Ellsburg's trial being thrown out of court.

1958040,5,B0000WN1N6,"THE PENTAGON PAPERS is a truly engrossing dramatic film! Despite being ""made for TV,"" wonderful performances abound in this movie. James Spader--an extraordinarily gifted actor--gives a top-notch portrayal of Daniel Ellsberg, which keeps the viewers' attention throughout the course of the film. The story has a fascinating plot that explores a complex question: is treason justifiable when it will reveal the truth to the public? Should revealing classified documents to prove the failures of the Vietnam war be considered treason...or should it be considered an act of patriotism? This film thoughtfully considers these questions and more, and leaves you to form your own opinions about whether Ellsberg's actions were right or wrong.

If you are a fan of James Spader, this film is a must...as he is at his best here. For anyone interested in a good story, based on true events, this movie is worth a look!",1104883200,43,909,5.141891891891892
1958041,5,B0000WN1N6,"Despite excellent supporting performances, this movie is really a one-man show: it's all about Spader's smart, emotional performance as Daniel Ellsberg.

Very little of the movie happens in the Watergate time-frame from which we know Ellberg's name.  Most instead covers the ten years (roughly 1963-1973) during which he reached the point of thinking the most patriotic act he could take was to release top-secret Department of Defense material about the Vietnam war. It's an engrossing exploration of the great questions: what is duty?  to whom do we owe loyalty?

Nothing explodes, except during a few striking, necessary scenes in Vietnam.  Thanks be for intelligent film-making.",1093737600,49,682,5.457142857142857

1958045,5,B0000WN1N6,"The Pentagon Papers, 2003 film

This is a story about Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon analyst with the highest security clearance for a civilian. He analyzed the reports from Vietnam and summarized them for the higher ranks. The scenes show Washington DC and Vietnam. It rains a lot in Vietnam. Scenes show M-1 carbines (from WW II) and M-14 rifles. Was the body count exaggerated? If this brings rewards there will be a bias to exaggerate. [In the Battle of Britain both sides did this.] There are fire fights, bodies, and blood. Back in the USA he wrote a history of US involvement for Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense. This was rejected by Kissinger! He is told to see a psychiatrist. They think there must be something wrong with him if he didn't support US policy in Vietnam. Walter Cronkite comments on the Tt Offensive. The people were lied to by four Presidents: Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson. The Gulf of Tonkin incident never happened!

Ellsberg hoped the truth would come out. He visited Senator Fulbright and told him of the plot to wage war. Would a US Senator expose State Secrets and break the law? Others also rejected him. Could he distribute these facts to the public? That would be illegal! Ellsberg made his decision. He began to make copies of the papers by using a friends Xerox machine. He remembers scenes from Vietnam. The FBI questions Ellsberg about the 7,000 pages. He denies any wrongdoing. He is advised to take a job with MIT. Later he contacted a reporter at the New York Times. The front page story was printed on June 13, 1971. Can the Nixon Administration stop this? The FBI hunt for Ellsberg. A cease-and-desist order stops the presses. Can they be distributed by other means? Nixons men broke into Ellsbergs psychiatrists office to steal files.

The Watergate Burglars were caught! Ellsbergs trial judge learned about the bizarre events, declared a mistrial, and dismissed the case. Ellsbergs friends rejoice. Ellsberg said a President cannot run the country by himself. [Think of that when you plan to vote.] The news reported the end of US involvement in Vietnam when helicopters evacuated US personnel from Saigon. Its finally over. Nixon and Agnew, the law and order candidates in 1968, had to resign for their criminal actions! Will we ever see a candidate who is accused of criminal acts? If so, I hope he (or she) will be rejected by the voters or as a candidate.

This story tells how the Government lied to the people. Have they stopped doing it? What about Operation Iraqi Liberation (which occurred before this movie)? Or the next Big Lie? There was no mention of the National Association of Editors and Publishers and their control of the media. Do you believe everything you read in the newspapers, hear on the radio, or see on television? You should never be credulous. You could also read All the Presidents Men or see the movie about another event from this era. What stories are being pushed in the media this month? Youve been warned.",1465948800,,3003,4.802707930367505

We would all do well to watch this and remember the blatant arogance of those who pursue power.  There are 2 Ellsberg videos, this is the hollywood drama version.  Ellsberg found secret pentagon studies from years earlier showing the war could not be won.  Every president knew the war was a farce and kept it going.  Movie accurately portrays why and how Ellsberg leaked the secret papers.  Equally important was the brazen legal battle fought by big newspapers to publish the papers.  I watched documentary version first (The Most Dangerous Man In America).  We should call it treason to lie about election campaign promises!  The movie points out Vietnam war crimes of treason against Congress and the public.  Movie dramatically shows how the military and the administration (Nixon) tried to stop the newspapers from printing leaked secrets about the war.  See for yourself what happened when Vietnam war secrets were leaked; see loyalty and security used to keep secrets from us and Congress.  Video shows how the newsmedia did not back down, published the secrets, and won a Supreme Court Case supporting their right to publish the secrets.  Supreme court agreed: public has right to know, press is free, free press has a role informing the public & keeping government honest, and the published secrets should not have been secret because they are public business.

1958062,5,B0000WN1N6,"Good people, making their best efforts make mistakes. Bad people, making their best efforts, make misery. In the Vietnam war, we had both. Spader's performance as the brilliant Daniel Ellsberg is transcendant, but to a large degree, Spader's performance is also an ""Everyman"" portrayal. Through Ellsberg's eyes we see the mystery of Our involvement in Vietnam unfold. We feel his awe in serving his country. We experience his fear and courage as he goes to Vietnam to see for himself the conditions and try to reconcile the competing and conflicting information the Executive branch was receiving. Ellsberg's evolution from Hawk to to Dove is fraught with questions of conscience, honor and duty. When Ellsberg ultimately turns over the ""Pentagon Papers"" to the New York Times the viewer is relieved and then thrust on another high risk action as Ellsberg then runs from the FBI and the Nixon Whitehouse until he decides to voluntarily turn himself in.

In Ellsberg's willingness to risk life imprisonment and integrity in turning himself in, he distinguished himself from his latter day ""heir"" Edward Snowden. Ellsberg didn't run and take asylum in the country of one of Our enemies. Snowden claims he was trying to get to a non-extraditable country (Equador). Snowden could have just as easily flown to Equador from Hawaii and met up in Equador with the journalists who broke the story rather than call a meeting in the People's Republic of China. Ellsberg redacted portions of the papers to protect assets in the field, contemporaneous actions, or other items that he, as an assistant to the Dept. Asst. Secretary of Defence, John McNaughton, would know were inappropriate to release. Snowden doesn't even know what he's released. Snowden was a self taught computer genius without a high school diploma or college degree who obtained his incomparable skills without any grounding in basic ethics, history or a literate understanding of how fragile peace really is. Ellsberg was a Ph. D.  Ellsberg, a former Marine, Rand Corp. researcher, Defense Dept. employee, MIT professor emerges as a hero willing to give his life for his country either on the battlefield or jail. Snowden, is hardly the hero he wanted to be. (For a fuller discussion on Edward Snowden see May 2014 issue of Vanity Fair).

Finally, ""The Pentagon Papers"" will resonate with a contemporary audience as well as with those of us who can dimly recall the events of times past. Whistleblowers have frequently saved our Nation from itself, but never is the disclosure easy or the consequences for the declarant anything like he or she truly expected. It's a cautionary tale, a brilliant tale and a lesson in what it takes to genuinely defend our nation against all threats both foreign and domestic. Well worth the purchase!",1398470400,5,2792,5.052060737527115
1958063,5,B0000WN1N6,Well-done and a must in today's word of government secrets. The story of Daniel Ellsberg and the massive cover-up of the American military victories during the Vietnam War.,1397692800,,172,5.178571428571429
1958064,5,B0000WN1N6,"It's startling & unsettling to realize how many people today don't know who Daniel Ellsberg is, or what he did for this country some 40 years ago. A brilliant, driven man, a former Marine & a major up-&-coming intellectual star during Lyndon Johnson's presidency, he began his work for the Department of Defense as an avid hawk regarding Vietnam. We were right to be there, we had to be there, we were going to win!

Or so he believed before harsh reality set in ....

Troubled by the massive discrepancies in official reports arriving from Vietnam, he volunteered to be an observer in the field, eventually staying in Vietnam for a couple of years. During that time, he saw more & more that the war was not only unwinnable, but essentially immoral. As he himself would eventually put it, ""We aren't on the wrong side, we ARE the wrong side.""

Upon returning to his position with the Rand Corporation, he was one of the contributors to the in-house, secret history of the war in Vietnam commissioned by Robert McNamara. When he began reading its 7000+ pages, he was shocked by what he discovered: a history of lies, deceptions, and moral blindness that permeated several presidencies, both Democratic & Republican. This tore his life apart, and his conscience would not allow him to remain silent. The American people had a right to know what was being done in their names, behind their backs.

And so he made his choice: to release the Pentagon Papers to the press, so that the public could know the truth. Ellsberg knew very well that he might face a lifetime in jail, but he would not be deterred. And the fallout was greater than anyone might have expected: Nixon's infamous ""plumbers unit"" that was also responsible for Watergate, which led led to the downfall of of his corrupt presidency. It was also a major victory for freedom of the press.

This taut docudrama gets all the facts right, and provides a multi-faceted view of Ellsberg, flaws & all. James Spader gives a superb performance, and Rod Holcomb's direction avoids the banalities of made-for-TV movies. Paul Giamatti has a wonderful supporting role as Ellsberg's friend, a Rand social scientist who becomes much more radical & countercultural during the 1960s. It's the perfect companion to the outstanding documentary ""The Most Dangerous Man in America"" -- both films should be seen.

It's amazing that this film was even made, much less broadcast during the early days of the Iraq War -- another disaster of American policy that the film comments on indirectly, since it's so much a repetition of Vietnam, right down to the lies used to plunge us into it. The only difference is that today, both the press & the public are far more willing to accept The Official Story put forth by the powers that be, rather than look for the harsh truth. See: Edward Snowden, for example.
