8677638,4,B00NEZGHDM,"This is a great ensemble movie, sort of a Big Chill meets Bridesmaids.  I was surprised at how much I identified with various characters.  A fun, but also really moving, reunion comedy about a group of girlfriends who get together for a weekend and share secrets and booze.  A great movie to watch with a bunch of your friends on a Sunday afternoon.",1421884800,,349,4.507936507936508
8677639,5,B00NEZGHDM,"Like the movies,""The Birdcage"" and ""Steel Magnolias"", you can clearly see why this movie was a hit as a stage production. It is a beautiful story about friendship, and the realization that the ties we made as teenagers run much deeper than we ever dreamed possible when we were growing up. The characters are engaging and real, and the life stories are those that every adult can relate to one some level. Loved it as a play, and happy to have the movie in my collection to watch whenever I want!",1412985600,4,496,4.461538461538462
