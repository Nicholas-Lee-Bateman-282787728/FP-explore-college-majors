5802022,5,B00DHHWY5W,"Each of these real life stories holds encouragement and wonder for anyone.  We get busy and take for granted the miracles in our own lives and these stories can bring focus once again as well as a calming effect that hard circumstances can be met unexpectedly by a miracle.  Have shared these stories with others going through difficult times - health and otherwise; they have benefited by the peace they experience in watching and considering the possibilities.  Stories are well presented.  Hope others enjoy the presentations, which I highly recommend.",1407283200,4,555,5.133333333333334

5802024,5,B00DHHWY5W,"These true life stories will make anyone believe in miracles.

8593244,5,B00DHHWY5W,"Good family show, many touching and uplifting true stories and they are separated into a few categories so its easy to pick up where you left off. If you are considering buying- buy ! Also try furious love- another eye opener but don't watch with your little ones",1459900800,2,263,4.5
8593245,5,B00DHHWY5W,"It's A Miracle is great show !  There are some.  incredible stories to see on these shows.  If you have never believed in the miracles of GOD; I think you might just change your mind; when you see these  true stories.

Richard Thomas is  wonderful at presenting  each segment. He brings intrege, warmth, sincerity,  and feeling to each narration. With Its A Miracle; you get your money's worth!",1448064000,3,394,4.6911764705882355
8593246,4,B00DHHWY5W,"warning to potential buyers --  I am in a quandary over how to rate this one, on one hand I know I love the shows on this set and want to give them a high rating, I feel I must warn potential buyers that a second 2014 Best of It's a Miracle set (blue cover) contains the exact same episodes.  I bought this earlier 2013 (the one with orange cover) second, thinking it would be different episodes since it came out a year earlier and so many of my favorite episodes were not in the blue cover set.  But the orange cover 2013 version appears to have the exact same episodes, hard to say for sure since there are no chapter lists.  If you don't have either set, I would suggest you buy the 2014 version with the blue cover as it has better picture quality and allows you to choose which episode you want to watch.  Very disappointed to have bought the same thing twice !!!",1447977600,9,869,4.179640718562874
8593247,5,B00DHHWY5W,"Again, I recognize some of the stories from the original show, but they are still good, and show God at work in the lives of us ordinary human beings.  This show should never have been taken off television because it always seemed to give people hope, and we all need hope to survive in this world.",1440374400,3,298,4.321428571428571

8593249,5,B00DHHWY5W,"I don't think you necessarily have to be religious to benefit from these stories, just believe -- or want to believe -- in the power of love.  There's a lot of love in these stories, and that's rare these days.  Highly recommended, especially for families, but really for anyone.",1422230400,,279,4.673469387755102
