2251575,1,B0007Y3XRG,"If I had to use a single word to describe the new series it would be: unwatchable.  I think an earlier reviewer captured the issue by commenting that the series had been ""Americanized.""  The costumes are overstated.  Too much time is spent force feeding the viewer the clues.  Unnecessary characters and plot lines have been added.  The humor that was such an integral part of the Joan Hickson series is missing.  They have lots of talent in the series but everthing seemed strained.",1115337600,47,483,4.759036144578313
2251576,5,B0007Y3XRG,"Agatha Christie's noevls were all very thrilling when released in print many years ago, but to the modern reader they are lacking the edge they once held. Magically however, they have been restored beyond their original capacity through clever script adaption, and flawless production. The casting is impeccable, and the overall effect is achieved so well, that even to an audience whose staple daily watching is the brutal modern murders and gore of Law and Order, CSI etc, when the story unfolds you break out in applause. These are stories that offer plots so devilishly constructed that you will not pick the ending, which is never stupidly concluded apon, and that is a virtue.",1115251200,6,682,4.991228070175438
2251577,5,B0007Y3XRG,"I found the new Miss Marple to be both human and smart.  I liked getting to see what things shaped her life. It made her more human, and made me admire her ability to sleuth her way through murders so well. I liked the picturesque village scenes, and the smart scripting and storylines, as opposed to the earlier versions.
This is indeed a good buy!
P.S. I am considerably older than 13.",1115251200,6,387,4.375
2251578,5,B0007Y3XRG,"Yes, Joan Hickson was a great Miss Marple, but those productions are hardly perfect.  This new Miss Marple is wonderful, with GORGEOUS set design, terrific guest stars, and an all-around zippy, fresh, humourous approach which brings new life to the material.  In time, people will admit how much they like this new incarnation!",1114992000,5,327,5.150943396226415
2251579,2,B0007Y3XRG,"Geraldine Mcewan is a great actress but she's not Jane Marple. Joan Hickson was as perfectly close to the novel as possible so why trot out another series? This new version has Jane Marple being cute, cuddly and a virtual clone of Jessica Fletcher. Come on now! Anybody who read even one Miss Marple book knows that she wasn't cute.

The viewer is treated to mild sexual scenes and we are told that Miss Marple was once involved with a married man. Huh? What book was all this in? I rather watch Margaret Rutherford do the twist than sit through this series again.",1114732800,25,564,4.475728155339806
2251580,1,B0007Y3XRG,"If you have ever seen Joan Hickson's Miss Marple, read one of the books, or even heard about the Agatha Christie character, you will be greatly disappointed with this new series. If I could give it zero stars, I would.

They have not only created a completely new Miss Marple character by giving her a cheery personality, twinkling eyes, and a tendency to brag about herself, they have provided her a past love affair with a married man - blasphemy of blasphemies! New characters inserted into the story add nothing, such as former French partisans in The Murder at the Vicarage. And, the dialogue is bad - even a fine actor like Derek Jacoby ends up giving a bad performance.

The actors in this series do not seem particularly British, so the series may be created mainly for American viewers - a marketing strategy that has historically led to films that bearly resemble the books from which they were derived. This is the case here too.

Agatha Christie is said to have been a vengeful person. If so, the people associated with this production had better avoid her in the afterlife.",1114646400,59,1086,4.675392670157068
2251581,3,B0007Y3XRG,"Geraldine McEwen is a wonderful actor and is certainly very good in this role, but this series plainly does not have

the charm nor the atmosphere of the Joan Hickson versions.

The Marple character here does not seem as well integrated into the stories as was the case in the

Hickson versions.  McEwen plays Marple with more of a modern day ""edge"" and

absence of warmth,  which I suppose is designed to

appeal to MTV generation viewers of today's more explicit procedural crime dramas.  This

lends a subtle ""false- modern"" quality to the period Marple stories, which are much better served

by a more neutral style of  acting and presentation, such as was done in the --yes, you guessed it!-- the JOAN HICKSON versions.

The McEwen series is not bad, it has just lost so much of the charm and whimsey which added so much to

the previous Hickson programs, and made them such an absolute joy to watch.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that the newer series is the one to get simply because it is newer!!

If you are a fan of Geraldine McEwen, you will want to see her work here, which is certainly good (as always).

There's no question she is a brilliant actor.  ---BUT if  you are a Christie fan, or a Marple fan, or just

like a good mystery story, you would be MUCH better served to buy the three available JOAN HICKSON sets

while they are still available.

JOAN HICKSON'S achievement as the overall ""best"" Miss Marple remains UNTOUCHED.",1114387200,21,1449,4.560311284046692
2251582,1,B0007Y3XRG,"I thought I'd never see the day when an Agatha Christie show would have warnings saying that some material would be objectionable to some viewers! She never wrote anything like that. When I first heard that there would be new Miss Marple shows released, I was very excited until I found out that not only are they ""remakes"" of shows that had already been admirably done with Joan Hickson but that ""sexual garbage"" had been added, including a revolting lesbian kiss in one of the stories, and even the proper Miss Marple is said to have had an affair with a married man in her youth! None of this is in any Agatha Christie story!

Why do they keep making remakes anyway?? There are plenty of Agatha Christie books that have never been filmed for TV and I would certainly welcome new ones but only if they were true to the books and not ""trashed"" for the sex obsessed society of today!",1114128000,30,883,4.450617283950617
2251583,5,B0007Y3XRG,"Geraldine McEwan brings a keen intelligence to all of her work, from Shakespeare to the delicious E.F.Benson's Mapp & Lucia. There's often a bit of a glint in her eye, like she's contemplating all around her with a secret delight. She's really really good in the new PBS production of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple (at least the first one, which is all that has aired to date in the US). Yes she's different than Margaret Rutherford, who played the role with broad strokes and a physical comedy that isn't really in the books. And Joan Hickson's work as Miss Marple in the '80's was absorbing, if she played the role in such an understated way that she sort of blended back into the wallpaper for much of each episode. McEwan falls somewhere between the two, and to my mind, plays the role in a truer character to the books than either of the other actors. I'm ordering the DVDs, and I'm sure I'll watch them as often as I do my Rutherford and Hickson versions (Rutherford's are sadly only on videotape as far as I know, and hard to get) -- all the Hickson Marples are on DVD and reasonably priced.",1113696000,23,1098,4.467661691542289
2251584,1,B0007Y3XRG,"...one worthwhile-watching Miss Marple, Margaret Rutherford. I really can't get used to this trend of releasing crap as a high priority. It looks like the 21st century is very keen of discarding most of what was worthy in the 20nd, while releasing almost all the crap of the same period. Since almost only trash is now being produced, why can't they be happy with it???!!!There was Stone Ages, Bronze Ages, etc, but we sure not getting in Golden Age, only S..t Age... and you can't even put a Zero (or less)",1113436800,8,507,4.582417582417582
2251585,2,B0007Y3XRG,"I own the Hickson collection so I am perhaps tainted by the uniform excellence of that Miss Marple series. I bought this in hopes that the quality of the series would be pushed along. I was disappointed. Changes have occurred in the BBC, hitherto dependable as a source for superb casting, writing, music, and so forth. If I am to be a critic, let me say why I do not like this series: Ms McEwan seems to have a fixed facial expression that vacillates between smile and 'almost smile,' and is, again, to me, inappropriate to the nature of the character she plays. Where Hickson's portrayal is/was spot on and believeable, Ms. McEwan's just misses Agatha's point.",1510185600,,662,4.666666666666667

2251593,1,B0007Y3XRG,"Geraldine McEwan is the worst for playing the part of Miss Marple. Perhaps it's just the direction, but she looks and acts quite dowdy and undignified, unlike the true Miss Marple. It's so disappointing to see these four novels being  rewritten by the screenwriters, only to suit their own egos and make the stories so profane. They made all the stories completely different, as though they knew better than Dame Agatha Christie.  If it's not broken, why fix it?  The true and loyal fans of Dame Agatha Christie will all agree that watching these videos is a waste of time, indeed.",1495497600,,581,4.732673267326732

2251596,3,B0007Y3XRG,"I have to say, I enjoyed Geraldine McEwan in the role of Miss Jane Marple. I also enjoyed Joanne Lumley as her village friend. Their performances are excellent. There, the enjoyment stops. It seems that the writers have gone Hollywood, taking these wonderful cozy mysteries and deciding that they need updating, changing characters and plots willy nilly. Well, there is a reason that Dame Agatha Christie has withstood the test of time, and the writing in this series is not it.

Moreover, the series seems to lack an authenticity of time and place, replacing the social mores of the time with those with of the current era. Whoever wrote these adaptations was clueless as to what has made Dame Agatha Christie a beloved writer generation after generation. Her  writing has stood the test of time. The writers who did these adaptations have not and will not.

Still, if you are a fan of the Jane Marple character, you may get a modicum of enjoyment from this series, if only to see Geraldine's McEwan's interesting interpretation of that character. I know that I will still go ahead and watch season 2, if only to see if the writers continue to apply their wrecking ball to a national treasure.",1490486400,6,1194,4.758454106280193

2251613,3,B0007Y3XRG,"The mystery to me about this series is why in some cases the script writer so wildly abandoned Christie's novels and used them as mere 'suggestions' for plots that really don't pass muster very well. Some were fairly straightforwardly done, with variations. Others were just nutty. The Sittaford Mystery was a complete mess, with a whole system of wierd plot events that had not a thing to do with Christie and a change of murderers. Compared to Jane Hixon, who in an earlier BBC series perfectly embodied the innocuous appearing and thoroughly ladylike maiden Miss Marple, McEwan is a silly picture of dotty eccentricity with an irritating voice. Never once did I detect in Christie or in Mrs. Hixon any hint that Jane Marple was in any sense a 'pathetic old maid' but this plot line is often put forward in the McEwan series. Christie is admittedly uneven herself, but she deserves better treatment than this.",1484870400,,911,4.846153846153846

Not only is she fantastic, the supporting cast is also superb. But what I enjoyed most was the outstanding Screenwriting for all episodes. For the ""purest"" out there you are going to be a little disappointed, but for the others this was a fresh take on all Miss Marple stories but yet maintained the Christie ""touch."" The villain remained the villain and the lovers the lovers but there was a fresh and slightly different take on each of the plots. And it was done SO WELL that I actually looked forward to watching another episode to see what quirks and changes had been made.

Whenever I'm in need of visual comfort and nourishment, especially on a dark and dreary day, I make a pot of tea and melt into one, or two, of these movies.  My favorite books to read, and movies to watch, have always been (good) mysteries.  (And they don't get much 'gooder' , sic, than an Agatha Christie.)  These versions of the books are beautifully crafted.  The locals and scenery  are what I hope for most in a great, period, mystery.  I rate these A+(infinity), and any time lounging and watching them is NEVER time wasted, but instead a time of comfortable familiararty, chock-full of 'ahhh, that's right' - moments.

At the very least, it is tremendously gauche and self aggrandizing on the part of the screen writer.

However, the rest of the series; Geraldine McEwan's interpretation of Marple, the sets, the acting, the costumes... absolutely worth 5 stars!

2251898,5,B0007Y3XRG,"Brilliant examination/reworking of the original stories. Just watched ""Murder at the Vicarage"" and ""The Body in the Library"" and while I agree that these aren't Christie as she wrote them, they are fascinating examinations of the original  work. I adore the Joan Hickson versions, and agree that Hickson owns the role of Miss Marple, and I'm thrilled that the Hickson versions have been remastered and are out on Blue Ray. However, Hickson is gone and will never make any more Marples, however much we may wish she could, and a person can only rewatch her work so many times. I was happily surprised with how much I enjoyed these new examinations of Chrities's iconic stories. While they are not purely Christie, they are very interesting and beautifully done. The productions values are fantastic, the Miss Marple cottage is absolutely mouth watering, the Vicarage is splendid, and the village of St. Mary Mead is lovely. The quality of the performances is outstanding. We have Mark Gatiss and Derek Jacobi in supporting roles for ""Murder at the Vicarage""!!! The way the stories have been reinterpreted is quite controversial, but to me there is room for a new examination. I find the relationship between the Vicar and Griselda to be spot on, and the portrayal of Colonel Protheroe to be much more sympathetic and nuanced and probably more true to how it actually would have been had it happened in real life. I also thought the character of Anne Protheroe as portrayed in this version was most interesting, and the explanation of why she married the Colonel in the first place rang true, and was something I've always wondered about. Additionally, while McEwan does not play Marple as Christie wrote her, that has already been done by Hickson. I feel that it was a wise choice to take a new slant on Marple, and to give us a Marple that has many of the original characteristics, but with a new twist that sheds a different light on some facets of the character. Again, an interpretation that is the more interesting for informing the perspective of the original character.  In fact, while these stories are not Christie, I found that by abandoning my outrage at the writers for changing the source material, I could enjoy what is in essence a discussion about the stories and characters with other people who love them.

2251915,1,B0007Y3XRG,"If you read Miss Marple Mysteries & fell in love with them as I have, then Im pretty sure that this version is not for you.  I know that there are a lot of comparisons to the Joan Hickson version.  But I think it just cant be helped.
Joan Hickson version was done with such love for the books & with such care, that its really hard to compete with it after.  Just like the Colin Firths & Jennifer Ehles Pride & Prejudice stands out as one of the best versions of the book, so does Joan Hicksons Miss Marple.
For instance, there is no way that Miss Marple in ANY  VERSION would have contemplated an affair with a married man.  I mean, really  Have they even read the books?
Another issue I find is when the plot changes to such a degree that the actual culprit is different than in the book as with Body in the Library.
Although Joan Hicksons Miss Marple fiddled with the characters & plot as well, it was done very carefully & did not change the story to such a degree that it almost became unrecognizable.
The casting is not as good either.  Although the actors themselves are a talented group, they don't seem to represent the characters they were assigned.  And quite often the hindrance to them being able to shine is the script, not their acting ability.
The only way that I could really look at it was to start thinking of it as a parody.  I mean can you imagine that Miss Marple would EVER tell Emma Crackenthorpe that Dr. Quimper did the murders for love of Emma?  Really?  Man murders his wife in order to marry Emma & then kills Alfred & Harold to increase Emmas share of the Estate.  Doesnt that just shout love?...  Love for money, maybe  But Emma?...
If you love Agatha Christies books & would like to see the representation of that society & charm of the time, stick with Joan Hickson version.  The casting of Joan Hickson was PERFECT.  I have read that she was picked by Agatha Christie herself.  The casting of all other characters was also done wonderfully & very carefully.  I cant say that I would have picked anyone else for any of those roles.  The sets and costumes were also superb, which cant be said for new version.
If you want to laugh & wonder at how such a farce could be made, then by all means try the new ones.",1424131200,2,2242,4.295238095238095
2251916,1,B0007Y3XRG,"HORRIBLE BEYOND WORDS.

First, the lady playing Miss Marple has no concept of the character at all.  She plays Marple like a homeless bag lady with twinkly eyes.  If you want to see the true Marple, rent the Joan Hickson and give this series a pass.

Second, each and every story is rewritten so as to be unrecognizable.  Sorry, but when you change everything except the title and character names and call it an adaptation, I call it FRAUD.  These stories bear no resemblance whatsoever to the original mysteries, which not only were far superior, but were cogent, logical and had continuity,  None of the film versions in this series bear any of those characteristics whatsoever.  There are even included in this series, stories in which Miss Marple never appeared!!!

Take it from me, if you are interested in seeing Agatha Christie stories, watch the original Marple series (from the 80s).  Also some, but not all of the Poirot series are close enough to the originals to give one an idea of the actual Christie stories.  However, this series, ""Agatha Christie's Marple"" is anything but.

I gave it a high rating because they are pretty well done, the two actresses who play the main character are engaging, the programs have a charm of their own and have a good but plagiarized flavor of the post war period. Those are the pros. To my way of thinking there is only one con but it is a BIG one for purists. ADAPTATIONS of the novels is the operative word. The plots, the characters, the focus are changed a lot. Although I've been devoted to the novels for years, I find that I need to check the novels to get my bearings with this series. I really find the series with Joan Hickson to be superior. She simply was WAS miss marble and the programs were essentially true to the novels. Luckily, I own that series on DVD.

2251946,5,B0007Y3XRG,I like Geraldine McEwan's portrayal of Miss Marple best of all because she fits the physical description of the character created by Agatha Christie.

2251947,3,B0007Y3XRG,"I love the theme song. I know that is such an innocuous detail, but it always catches my ear and I find myself humming it.

Besides that, I'm disappointed -- as others have commented -- regarding the degree to which the writers have deviated from the original plots as delineated in Christie's books. There seems to be an infatuation with homosexuality which I can only crack up to an effort to be contemporary. The story characters also love to smoke. I don't know whether the writers thought this added to the sophistication of the characters or what, but in some stories these characters are constantly puffing away. The actors themselves seem to do a 'good enough' job. I can't say that I declare any kind of affinity for the characters the way that I do when I watch the other BBC renditions featuring Joan Hickson. Usually, with those adaptations, I find myself feeling more for the specific characters. I'm drawn in to who they are and their struggles. With these less so. Many of the characterizations seem petty and shallow in my estimation.

The lead, Geraldine McEwan, does a fine job. It's certainly different that Joan Hickson's portrayal but I expect that. I mean, you can't and shouldn't expect a new actress to reincarnate a classic role as previous actors do. I am not sure about this hidden love affair from the past that is alluded to in a couple of stories. I only remember ""Lionel Mattingly"" being mentioned in ""At Bertram's Hotel"" (one of the Joan Hickson movies) but there her mother ""nipped it in the bud"" because ""a girl needs a mother's watchful eye."" Even there, I'm not sure if that is consistent with the book that the movie was based upon as I haven't looked into that particular book.

Of the series, I find that I enjoyed The Sittaford Mystery very much. It's probably the isolation from the snow and the close quarters the plot dictates that drew me in. I still think they could have done so much more with it though that would have added to the ambience -- especially with the seance! I've watched it quite a bit; however, Miss Marple was not in that book. So, this is another way in which the writers are stretching the Christie's work. It didn't bother me, though, I can't say I preferred Marple's nephew Raymond West in this portrayal. As a whole, I do not like how he is portrayed frankly.

That said, I wouldn't say NOT to watch them. I just think they range from being very poor (e.g., The Body in the Library) to enjoyable (e.g., The Sittaford Mystery). So, my advice is watch at your own risk. My kids (8 and 10 as of 2014) both enjoy mysteries but I will not let them watch these because of the mature themes. Very 'hit-and-miss'.",1414281600,,2673,4.5625

2251975,5,B0007Y3XRG,"McEwan is the very best Marple I have ever seen, before and since.  Yes, I have the same quibble as one of the other reviewers regarding the young Marple's married boyfriend.  It isn't that this error in judgement is uncommon for a woman of her time, as it is for any period in history, but that it isn't an error I would expect a smart, clever woman like young Miss Marple would have been, even then, to ever stumble into.  Miss Marple isn't foolish, nor does she stumble.  In her seeming sweet tempered way she quietly observes, her mind never at rest, though her body seems to be.  She is sweet, and she is kind, but she never misses anything.  She discusses the crimes with the astounded detectives as if they already both know these obvious clues, saving the detectives ego, while they both know very well he has missed the clue  completely.  And in one of the episodes, as she has had one of these discussions with an astounded detective, she turns and starts her swift little patter home, the detective lowers his voice to the Sargent and comments that she is a remarkable woman and that he doesn't know whether to give her a ""swift kick or a box o chocs""  ever vigilant Miss Marple continues walking away and comments that she would ""prefer the chocolates"".  That's Marple, always in attendance, even when you don't think she is.
McEwan is the perfect Marple, believable as the little old lady quietly knitting, that everyone talks to, but no one suspects she is listening to more than the words they say, and seeing everything.  A quick, and perhaps unnecessary note about the current Miss Marple, plump and angry, with skin the betrays her as a lifelong smoker, is less like a Marple than any I have seen, from ancient black and white movies to bright and well produced current TV version.  I simply do not buy the current actor as Marple.  I will stick with McEwan.  She is Marple to me.",1409443200,,1898,4.527859237536657

I never saw Joan Hickson in the other series, and to be honest, I really disliked her narration of the audio books, so I actually read the books.  Since I didn't have a preconceived notion of what the character should be like based on Hickson, I thought that the Geraldine McEwan version was WONDERFUL.  These are great adaptations of Agatha Christie's mysteries.

Geraldine McEwan portrays a very believable Marple, as murders seem to drop into her path.  She is inquisitive, humorous & fun as she hunts down the murderer.

2252114,5,B0007Y3XRG,The (small) screen writers who did this series kept the title character closer to the ironically cynical heroine that Ms. Christie wrote about.  Well worth watching,1401494400,,164,5.3076923076923075
2252115,4,B0007Y3XRG,"Agatha Christie is always entertaining.  The screen play adaption is excellent and somewhat different from earlier offerings of the same name.  Although McEwan is an excellent actress, it seems she misses the interpretation of Chrisitie's character by being a bit too dogmatic and cocksure.  The earlier interpretation by Joan Hickson is the consummate portrayal of the aging spinster who never misses a detail in observations and never forgets a similar situation back home in St. Mary Mead.

It is an entertaining mystery done in a meticulous period fashion with beautiful settings with all the right details of cars, etc.",1401494400,,624,5.2727272727272725

2252117,5,B0007Y3XRG,"More modern media tends to have very rapid, short cuts and many time shifts. This series runs a little slower paced and is not so stressful as a result. Well, I'm sure it's stressful for the people who are murdered, and probably for the murderer also. Come to think of it, it's probably stressful for the people who are trying to make as much money as possible from the movies also. And of course, the amazon video servers are probably stressed just as much no matter what content is showing.
Really, I'm not sure why I said that a murder mystery wasn't so stressful. Maybe I was trying to mislead you. One caveat, having read widely among Agatha Christie's prolific repertoire through the years, sometimes we have vague hints that we can't quite put our finger on as to who really did it. But this just makes us feel smug--and maybe so very slightly less stressed?
I think I'll have a cup of tea.",1401408000,,897,4.475609756097561

This is a highly enjoyable series to watch and try to outwit the old girl as the plot moves along, however I haven't been able to do that -so far- but I am getting better ;- ) .  I would recommend Agatha Christie's Marple series to all who enjoy stories along the lines of Columbo or Poirot, and the like.  I enjoyed the Miss Marple series thoroughly !!!",1400889600,,541,4.336633663366337
2252135,4,B0007Y3XRG,"For many people Joan Hickson simply WAS Miss Marple in the BBC TV movies of the 1980s.  But I wager that Geraldine McEwan has done an admirable job of fusing this favorite amateur sleuth with new life (at least in this first series).  Having read the books that these episodes are dramatized from, I am only too aware of the plot changes (from subtle lesbian relationships among minor characters in ""A Murder is Announced"" and ""The Body in the Library"" to giving Miss Marple a romantic, other-woman back story that never EVER was in Christie's original work in ""A Murder at the Vicarage"").  Yet when I compare this first group of four to the episodes that would follow the tampering with Agatha Christie's original text is tame by far.  Each of these four 90+ minute movies stand out in their own right, never feeling like the same old format again and again.  Some of the actors are surprising choices for this kind of work (yes that is the comedian David Walliams in ""The Body in the Library"" and the razor-sharp Catherine Tate doing her best Polish accent in ""A Murder is Announced"").  McEwan herself beautifully conveys the quiet omnipresence of Miss Marple (if you read Christie's original books it is sometimes startling how seldom we see or hear from Miss Marple until the very end).  She watches these human tragedies unfold before her, but she is never anything less than quaint and dear, if a little nosy, but always sharp as a tack.  There is practically none of the prim starchiness of a Victorian spinster that was and is so integral to Miss Marple's character (and what Joan Hickson became so adept at portraying in the BBC TV movies).
The acting is great, the plots are respectful of the original text (yes, overall the plots unfold very close to the books!), and we have a new look at an old friend!  Don't miss these adaptations, they don't get better from here...",1400803200,,1881,4.658610271903323
2252136,5,B0007Y3XRG,"I chose this rating because the films were well done with quality scripts well acted. I enjoy the books of Agatha Christy and found these film adaptations delightful.  What is more, I could watch them with my children and not have to worry about gratuitous language or sexuality yet at the same time the violence of murder was not avoided.

I particularly enjoyed the skillful performance of Geraldine McEwan. To me, she is as perfectly Miss Marple as could possibly be. The other actresses who have taken on the part cannot touch her.

Another aspect I have enjoyed has been seeing actors and actresses quite young who I recognize from their later work. This was a delight, guessing from a familiar face what later film or mini-series in which I had seen them.",1400803200,,761,4.706766917293233

I enjoyed following a familiar character (Marple in a general sense) not knowing what was next in the story. I can't say I like them better, they just something different.",1399593600,,360,4.553846153846154

2252159,1,B0007Y3XRG,"Some elements of British tv must think every 4.79 persons is homosexual.  Characters have been introduced or recast as gay to reflect this, changing the tone and/or plot of the books.  Apparently, the creators of this series can't imagine two people of the same gender being just friends, even in the era of the Marple stories, when it was very common.  And, ironically, by trying to make Miss Marple more 'hip', the writers fall into the error of those characters in the Marple stories that dismiss or underestimate her because she's old and therefore out-of-touch and irrelevant.  It's jarring to reconcile the McEwan portrayal (adulterous affair; flapper history?) with the Marple from the books.  I think Joan Hickson is the actress that most closely reflected the image I have of Miss Marple.  You might view this via the public library before committing it to your personal library.",1399334400,2,888,5.006802721088436

2252173,4,B0007Y3XRG,"As usual, Agatha Christi weaves an intriguing tale of murder and mis-direction of clues.  As in her other mysteries, eg. Poirot, the police are rather incapable of solving the murder due to their provincial attitudes.  Through logic, awareness and deduction Miss Marple perceives the gist of the crime and the identity of the culprit.",1398816000,,334,5.166666666666667

2252194,2,B0007Y3XRG,"Hmm, where to start? I would have been more impressed, had I not found myself always comparing Ms McEwan with Joan Hickson's Miss Marple. Obviously one should not fault the actress herself, so much as the director who is interpreting each scene and coaxing satisfactory performances (satisfactory to the director, at any rate) from the cast. The overall effect is, well, muddled: I kept looking for truly engaging characters -- but no, each episode simply presented a collection of flat individuals standing here, or milling about, or standing there, uniformly giving performances captured in muddy color from not-very-interesting positioning of the cameras. And throughout the series one encounters the 21st-century sexual realignment, massaged into Dame Agatha's plots. Ultimately the series will continue to succeed. But not because it is a worthy presentation of Miss Marple: it will succeed because of its sentimental association with a truly great mystery writer, and because it is a freebie with Amazon Prime and, most sadly, because not very many who sit down to watch these videos, will have enjoyed Ms Christie's text. First star of the rating is for quality, as I've outlined it; I nudged it up to the second level because, after all, the production doesn't utterly fail. It simply disappoints. Consistently.

Likely this won't be a popular review with folks who find themselves fans of what I have identified as flaws. For everyone else, do ask yourself the question, ""What is my time worth this evening?""",1398124800,2,1517,5.191836734693878

At the same time, too broad, too dramatic, unconvincing acting and a bit too much bumbling by the male characters. Miss Marple sees through it all, of course.

There is a pixie like quality at first glance that completely obscures the keen incisive mind hidden behind the facade.

I have to keep pushing the ""back"" button on my DVD because I missed something vital!  Anyway, what I have found is that you cannot do needlework when you are watching these ""Marple"" mysteries.  You have to pay close attention to what is going on and the many characters in the script otherwise you will be LOST! After I realized I needed to ""pay close attention"", I am on the fence about whether I like them well enough to buy more.

2252344,3,B0007Y3XRG,"I read Agatha Christie's ""The Body in the Library"" a few years ago, and really enjoyed it.  In fact, the reason that I decided to watch the movie on Amazon Instant Video was to refresh my memory of the plot.  Well, that didn't happen.  While the scenery and the costumes in the movie were breath-taking, I had a heck of a time trying to follow the story line because so many things just seemed to pop up into the story all at once, with the end result being that this movie version seemed very disjointed.  The pacing was off.

Magaret Rutherford appears to be more convincing in the part of Miss Marple than Geraldine McEwan, although I have not seen her play Miss Marple in ""The Body in the Library.  I regret that I discovered this a tad too late, because I purchased the Miss Marple series with McEwan  as Miss Marple a few years ago; however, I have not had a chance to watch it, because I was doing renovations to my house at the time, and  placed it in storage.  Oh well, perhaps McEwan will grow on me as Miss Marple when I watch her in more episodes.  If so, I shall gladly do an update of my rating.  At the conclusion of this movie, to my dismay, I found that one of the reasons I was having so much trouble keeping up, with the action, and remembering what happened in the book was because the story is quite different than the author's original intentions.  Now, I guess I'll have to go back and read the book again, which I probably should have done in the first place.",1390089600,,1483,4.257142857142857

2252346,5,B0007Y3XRG,"They are darling films based on the plots and characters Agatha Christie devised.  That novels never written wih the intention of becoming TV can be translated to such a enjoyable films is a tribute to what an all time great artist she was.  One reviewer is so upset that the plot changes to ""match modern issues"" (I think that was the phrase) doesn't seem to realize that this is a hall mark of a truely great author.  A tweak here and there is all it takes to transform a story for the next generation.

The casting, acting, and play writing make a light entertaining evening.  I have especially enjoyed the trains in ""4:50 From Paddington"".  The period detail in general is a peek at how they lived not all that long ago.",1390003200,5,724,4.446969696969697

2252364,5,B0007Y3XRG,"Geraldine McEwan is yet another in a long line of illustrious Miss Maples - Margaret Rutherford comes to mind, and Angela Lansbury, but there is no shortage. What is interesting is that each of these fine actresses gives the viewer a somewhat different Miss Marple, and each of them is equally convincing - personally, I think it's because Agatha Christie drew the character in rather broad lines and left others to fill in the details as they saw them.

In some ways I feel  that Ms. McEwan is probably closest to what Agatha Christie had in mind. In any event, she plays it like a doughty old lady from a small English village - but with an unmistakable glint in her very pretty eyes.

Unless you've been living on the moon, you already know the plots to  these stories, but that doesn't stop them being fresh fun each time around. This one is no exception.",1389139200,,859,4.52258064516129

Are these four mysteries faithful adaptations of Agatha Christie's books?  No.  But they are enjoyable.  These mysteries have been filmed so many times it's a foregone conclusion who did what and why.  Seeing how the filmmakers approached something so familiar and still made it absorbing was what fascinated me.  At this point it's not so much a question of whether or not they should tamper with another author's work, in a perfect world an author's work would be sacrosanct.  This is not a perfect world.  At best, this is a great example of how popularity can be a curse.  The fact that this author's work is oft filmed is a testament to her talent and the enduring fondness for her characters.

While it does provide some information into character motivation that is lacking in the Hickson version, the plots have been re-adjusted for more ""contemporary"" tastes and this storyline gives Miss Marple a ""love interest"" that I find to be jarringly out of character for her.

2252482,3,B0007Y3XRG,"When it comes to Miss Marple, I am a Joan Hickson snob. Ms. McEwan in this series is a little too cheesy for my tastes and not quite up to Acorn media standards. Acorn also produces such series as ""Poirot"" with David Suchet and ""Foyle's War"" with Michael Kitchen. Acorn simply doesn't seem to take this actress' ability to portray Jane Marple seriously. Ms. McEwan comes across a little too conceded with a certain irritating quality and she simply doesn't 'pull off' the cunning sleuth act.

The series has no shortage of first rate actors, mostly British and some American. Even with the addition of these top notch actors, their roles have the same cheesiness and it really detracts from their involvement.

The setting/time period/background/costumes are all appropriate and nicely done. Nothing seems out of place and it is reproduced rather well.

2252488,1,B0007Y3XRG,"For The Body In the Library:

These new Marples have of course deviated by varying degrees from the books, but some are still decent enough stories, however displeasing to ardent Christie fans. This one fails on all counts.

This Marple is a bit too laid back in general and downright offensive in the know-it-all unfolding, rendered especially absurd with the two detectives sitting there slack jawed. Besides, there's something especially sicky about some of her aspect in that segment. Joan Hickson gave us a character capable of expressing varied natural emotional reactions, a respectable primness which is part of her character and a sharing of her wisdom in an entirely more palatable fashion. She was set in some ways, but people of all ages were comfortable with her. This woman has a vacancy about her along with being too quirky and impersonally strange.

Most ghastly was the Inspector Melchett portrayal - a complete ass. It was downright embarrassing to watch and listen at many points. Bizarre. It's hard to believe a director and/or producer passed such a performance.  The Basil Blake was a blubbering sham, his ""Mrs."" being a poor substitute as well. The Dolly Bantry was too young and too effusive. The Col. Bantry character was phoned in both by script and portrayal.

The cinematography being crisper actually worked against the production in comparison with the 1980's version. It only served to more painfully expose the glaring deficiencies of this thoroughly gaffed production.

The Joan Hickson production carried more depth all around. The actors in that one presented varied dimensional characters, entirely more credible and living in their types. As for the ones here - flimsy cardboard cutouts. The young boy at the hotel might have been the best.

Really poor job done here - worst yet. It comes across as a cheap, discounted rendition with a bizarre, gagging travesty of an ending. If you want to do your own story, call it something different.  Don't dumb down, trash up and depreciate one of quality by a classic author and call it the same thing.

This series is beautifully filmed. The scenery and costumes are visually compelling. The music is perfect to the time and place. But the plotting and characterization is overdone. The Marple books were deliberately quiet and low-key. These productions are glossy and brassy. There is energy and humor, but little charm. Although visually faithful to the period, the content is distinctly modern.

And finally there is the portrayal of Miss Marple. To me she is too aggressive, too outspoken, too energetic. I always pictured Miss Marple as more of an observer, someone no one knew was watching, someone everyone underestimated. This Miss Marple would make the criminal cautious and suspicious.

All that being said, if I had not read and re-read all the Marple books, if I had not seen all the early adaptations, I would have really liked this series. It would have been a 4.",1373155200,,1134,4.865284974093265

""The 4:50 to Paddington"" and ""The Body in the Library"" are two of our favorites, and those are the only two in this season that we've watched.  We both liked the twinkle in this Miss Marple's eye, but she bears little resemblance to the character in Agatha Christie's books.  She doesn't dither or act old, everyone treats her like a star detective, and the few comparisons she makes, which give her the key to solving the crime in the books, seem totally out of character.

2252567,3,B0007Y3XRG,"I enjoyed this movie for the photography, the colors, and the beautiful actresses (Griselda and Lettice for the Vicarage, or Miss Lucy Eyelsbarrow).  They do a good job on the scenery and the wardrobe.  That said, there is much departure from the original storyline.  Possibly in the interest of not dragging the movie too long, the number of suspects is reduced, and key plot twists are simplified.  The focus is often shifted from conversations and logical deductions to petty action: e.g., the archeologist and his assistant, who play a minor role in the book, occupy too much screen time sneaking around Protheroe's house, trying to break into locked rooms and spying on conversations.  This misses the point.  The appeal of Agatha's mysteries rests not in suspense but in making logical sense of a mess of conflicting evidence.  Another point missed is the pace of the movie.  Marple jumps from one conclusion to another at the speed of a New Yorker, people walk as fast as NYC streets, and there's hardly a second in the movie free from action.  That's very different from what one expects from an idyllic village like St. Mary Mead.  Finally the Miss Marple actress herself looks too young and too dumb to fit the role.  The reminiscences of her past life detract from the main plot, and are nowhere to be found in the original novel.  So as an entertaining movie, I do not completely give this 1 star, but it is not Agatha Christie's Murder in the Vicarage.

For the 4:50 from Paddington, many of the actors had American accents.  The whole thing seems produced for an American audience.

2252579,1,B0007Y3XRG,"The first season of AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MARPLE from ITV adapts four whodunits:  Murder in the Vicarage; A Murder is Announced; The Body in the Library; and 4:50 from Paddington.

(VAGUE SPOILERS)

These adaptations faithfully reproduce the cold-blooded nature of the crimes as portrayed in the novels, but eliminate the sense of evil attached to them.  The intention is to elicit sympathy not for the victims, but for the MURDERERS.  Not all murderers, mind; only those motivated by romantic passion.  The amount of sympathy lavished on the killer is directly correlated to the degree in which Sex was that person's excuse for the crime.  Killers get extra sympathy for being hot and homosexual, a bit less for being homely or heterosexual, but really all Sex is good, and renders any cold-blooded murderer worthy of our sympathy.  Considerations such as the cruelty of the crime or the innocence of the victims simply do not matter.  Thus the most monstrous villains of the batch get the most tears and violins, because they did it for ""Love"".  But the most pitiable killer is pitied least, due to the platonic nature of that person's motives.

Christie's Miss Marple had a great sympathy for human frailty - but also a firm sense of right and wrong and a quiet but fierce outrage on behalf of the innocent.  Beneath her gentleness and gentility was the glint of cold steel.  THIS Miss Marple has a ""cute"", ""feisty"", ""unconventional"" exterior pasted over a weak and insubstantial core.  She twinkles and mugs at scenes of violent death, and delivers ALL her lines in a goofy self-caricature such as one might use to entertain small children.  When she isn't rhapsodizing about the love-lives of child-killers, she's fawning over the photograph of an adulterous paramour from her youth.  Apparently, the qualities that have made her formidable, beloved, and world-famous can be dispensed with, but it is all important that she should have a sex life.

The writing and directing staff here is all-male, and they lose no time in letting you know it.  In the very first scenes you'll get to watch a teenage girl get ogled up and down slowwwly by dirty-old-man cam, not once but twice.  Like Miss Marple herself, strong adult women and any other characters that should possess some moral authority are reduced to caricature.  The Vicar who counsels two lovers against adultery - for the very good reason that it could only end in harm and disgrace for the woman -- is as penalty turned into an emasculated buffoon, so that his scruples will be less threatening to the frat-boy mentality.  (Compare this to the dignified and moving portrayal of this character in the Hickson version.)

This terror of old-fashioned morality is so extreme that it prevents the portrayal of the 1950's setting in anything but a visual sense - with the result that nobody's behavior makes much sense, and some of Miss Marple's more clever social observations (such as the difference between married and unmarried lovers) have to go. Apparently they think we will be shocked if the characters actually behave as though they are living in the era reconstructed with such effort and expense by the set people.

As might be expected, the ""politically correctness"" in this series is not enlightened or humanistic; It is misogynistic, ignorant, bigoted, juvenile, and oblivious to these qualities in itself.  This applies in spades to the prurient and stereotypical treatment of homosexuality.  I am not against intelligent alteration of old stories (such as in the POIROT series from the Nineties, or the best of the Joan Hickson Miss Marples).  But these guys alter anything and everything just for the sake of it, and completely miss every point there is to miss.

Precisely what makes Miss Marple novels still feel modern today is that Miss Marple never was modern or ""politically correct"" in the first place.  She was introduced as this outdated product of Victorian upbringing who had spent her entire life in a tiny provincial village.  Yet she ran circles around the hip, happening young things and worldly gentlemen who thought themselves so superior, and demonstrated (to their dismay) that human nature was no different in their cosmopolitan circles than in her backwater village.  Judging from Christie's sales figures, the hip happening young things of the time rather enjoyed this joke at their own expense, and its deeper humanistic moral, and have continued to do so since.  But not these guys!  Their ""Marple"" has to have every up-to-date modern attitude, or they cannot relate to her, or imagine her relating to them.  That is pretty sad, in my opinion.",1354492800,14,4638,4.9818181818181815
2252580,1,B0007Y3XRG,"Unfortunately these rewrites of Christie classics are anything but ""true to the spirit"" of Agatha Christie.  She must be spinning in her grave with indignation over these travesties.

Characters are dropped, others are made up and inserted for little or no reason.  Teenage characters (13 and 16 years old, main characters in different stories) are portrayed as being older than the same character in the novels and far more sophisticated (if you equate a certain type of sexuality with ""sophistication"").

All the older characters drop a full generation, so that middle-aged characters are now twenty-somethings and elderly characters are now merely middle aged.  EVERYBODY is far better looking than in real life OR the novels.  Culprits are changed and the sexuality of main characters is modified.  ""Romantic"" themes that were not present in the original stories, usually involving main characters that were invented solely for these TV episodes, are inserted for little or no reason, and add not a thing to the main story line.

As for Geraldine McEwan being the ultimate Marple, sorry, but she's not.  This ""Marple"" bears little resemblance to the Jane Marple of the books.  There is nowhere near enough of the wry humor of the original, nor of the air of genteel poverty that Miss Marple lives in, as is clear throughout the original Christie tales.  She has an ""income"" but it is not sufficient to keep her in true comfort; hence she trains young girls who want to ""go into service"" for that little bit of extra income and/or in exchange for their services while they are in training, and in her declining years she is largely supported by her nephew.

In particular, Miss Marple wouldn't have been caught dead dressing like a dowdy charwoman, which is what the wardrobe choices for her in these episodes make her look like.

Main characters are relegated to becoming bit parts, disappear altogether, or are warped into totally unrecognizable caricatures of stereotypical types that bear absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the originals; in one case, the original character of a bumbling country priest is transmogrified into a snarling raving Nazi.  The character isn't the only thing about that story that's insane; whoever mangled these stories for the sake of ""modernizing"" the scripts ought to be stood up against a wall somewhere and summarily shot.

These stories have not been improved by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead, they've been mangled into near unrecognizability, with Christie's witty, gentle, loving character studies being replaced by prurient sensationalist ""plots"" that are about as subtle as the blunt object the murder victim gets clubbed with.

Don't confuse these travesties with the fine productions staring Joan Hickson.  She didn't quite capture all of Miss Marple's character - she's just a tad bit too severe - but she at least rang true to the era and the character, even if incompletely.  She just didn't have the ""birdlike"" quality Miss Marple of the novels has, but she hit almost every other Marple note dead on.  The wry wit, the gentle but inexorable sharpness of her intellect, her masterful and largely non-judgmental grasp of the vagaries of human existence; Joan Hickson got those all dead on.  Of course she was undoubtedly helped no end in her portrayal by being given scripts that are as true to the original novels as possible. Miss Marple fits into that world as created by Christie for her.  Change that, and the Miss Marple you get is something wholly different and entirely (in these cases) unsatisfactory.",1349913600,8,3577,5.068259385665529
2252581,5,B0007Y3XRG,The PBS imports of the Mystery series are generally of high quality - and this particular adaptation is just fantastic. There are other Marples worth watching but none with the kind of terrific cast they got for this particular episode.,1347321600,2,236,4.925
2252582,1,B0007Y3XRG,"My goodness, maybe it was a bad idea to watch the Joan Hickson version back to back with the current version. Plots have been changed, lesbian love affairs crop up out of nowhere, people who were married suddenly aren't and are alcoholics with missing children and no wife, the Nazis are bombing everyone and everyone is traumatized by the blitz, Jane Marple had an affair with a married man and still pines for him, (which is why she's a spinster, because being single is unnatural,) clues are handed out like free coupons and explained with a huge sledge hammer to the face, (instead of subtle hints along the way,) detectives who usually blunder along suddenly tell the audience what it all means, murderers are changed around and motives are tampered with, and Jane Marple's brilliance is dimmed.

I could go on!

My main objection is this: Agatha Christie's books have sold millions and millions of copies, because she worked and agonized to ensure that the plot would come together into a great story. And here, with this ghastly series, we have writers and directors who make things up out of nowhere, seemingly to follow their own agenda of improving on a masterpiece. It is fine to add your own flavor, but why would you completely change who the killers are and why they murdered someone? Why invent romantic interactions that did not exist and have no point? Agatha Christie was a MASTER of commenting on human interactions and motivations. Learn from her writing and ADD to it, don't mess with it and make it into something atrocious and candy-coated. Simply ludicrous!

If you love Agatha Christie's books and feel like torturing yourself over ridiculous changes, by all means, watch this series.",1340236800,41,1709,4.865979381443299
2252583,5,B0007Y3XRG,"The stories are great and the photography is good, but I do not like that they changed the ending on The Body in the Library. I have a Blu Ray disc player attached to my TV, and in order to get cc to work I needed to connect a composite video out cable to the TV in addition to the HDMI cable. Since this is not a Blu Ray disc, the cc info is transmitted in analog hence the need for the composite cable (will not be transmitted over HDMI). I labeled the composite input to the TV as DVD.

The stories covered are vintage Christie: The Body in the Library, The Murder at the Vicarage, 4:50 from Paddington and A Murder is Announced. Geraldine McEwan is a bit more warm and sparkly than I pictured Miss Marple being, but she definitely portrays Miss Marple's insight and wisdom well.  I quite liked her as Miss Marple.  I read the mystery novels this series is based upon some years ago, so was fine with any changes.  I like to watch these while on the treadmill.

What a disappointment!!  The producers really should have read more than the title of the books.  The plots have been ""sexed up"" and as other reviewers have pointed out some of the changes are totally foreign to the character of Miss Marple:  she is seen to have an illicit affair with a married man.  Miss Marple had too much class to demean herself or to betray a man's wife in such a way.  Of course two women who are living together have to be lesbians - news to readers of the novels. Mrs McGillicuddy's son is of course living with his girlfriend etc etc

Agatha Christie is a very wonderful story teller and why the writers for TV think that they have to improve her writting is beyond me. Like adding the French resistance which was not in the book and having her maimed by a motorcycle, she would have stayed home anyway because that is how she did things. Miss Marple was a born spinster so why take some of the good parts of the story out just to add (which added nothing) her long dead lover which was also not in the story. The book is very good, has a lot of humor which both movies left out. Maybe there was some humor because Geraldine McEwan went around smiling like she just ate a mouthful of sour cherries.

My hearing is pretty normal, but I gave up watching these DVDs because there was so much dialogue I couldn't understand.",1291766400,,502,4.91764705882353
2252589,5,B0007Y3XRG,"There are four DVDs in this package from the generally highly praised PBS Mystery series: The Murder in the Vicarage, A Murder is Announced, The Body in the Library, and 4:50 from Paddington. All of the episodes last one and a half hours. All are ""updated"" versions of original Agatha Christie stories; they occur in more modern times. All are about the aged Miss Marple who has keen insight into people's character and, despite the reluctance of the police, becomes involved in solving murders because of her knowledge of human psychology, based upon her observations of people in seemingly insignificant acts in her small home city.

The episodes start with a scene from years back and then jump forward about a decade. For example, in Murder in the Vicarage, the first scene is about a wife seeing her husband off to war. The husband says that she should not come to the train to see him off. He is met at the train by another woman, and it is clear that the two are in love. The film then jumps forward many years and a story of a murder is told. We are not told who the second woman is, what happened to the husband or, more significantly, what this episode has to do with the murder. This is not revealed until the end. It adds another mystery to the murder case.

Similarly, in the final story, 4:50 from Paddington, the film begins with the death of a woman who dies saying that money is not the most important thing in life. Then the film jumps ahead a decade.

The stories are interesting. All focus on love. Clues are rarely dropped for the viewers or are very subtle, and the endings are surprises. The stories, as in all Agatha Christie tales, are filled with red herrings. An example is in the final episode. One of the characters refuses to reveal information. It seems that he does so because he is the murderer. Another characteristic is that what appears to be a relationship is shown by subsequent events not be so.  Still another characteristic is that the English people act differently than Americans would act under the circumstances and, despite the same language, speak differently and interestingly. All in all, the shows are well worth the time to watch them.",1288483200,2,2186,4.611825192802057

She was intrigued with the period settings and murder mystery clues. I loved the role model of Jane Marple as a old fashioned sleuth, assertive yet polite. The stories are intriguing, the locations sumptuous and the smart and wiley old lady shows her intellectual power. I'm hoping that my grandchildren will develop a taste for crime fiction, by starting off on mild, non-gory, murders like these.

Each actress puts their stamp on the character. The McEwan Marple series took liberites with the storyline.  But they just about had to.  They didn't want to rehash the same stories.  They have taken liberties with Marple in the past, (the Rutherford films) no reason to stop this go round. Certain things like the homosexual angles that were hidden in the books and in the Hickson series, are more open and direct.  For the purist there is still Hickson and the more faithful adaptations. There are cons to the Hickson series. Older production and generally weaker acting.  This series offers better acting and terrific technical production. Geraldine McEwan is a lot younger  Marple, with faded wall flower beauty.  The ongoing background story line of Miss Marple's first love is rather tedious and pointless.

On the whole, the series is pretty enjoyable. To heck with the books and the Hickson series.  It's been done.  They just wanted to put a new spin on the old stories.",1272844800,,1118,4.867724867724868

I have to agree to a certain extent on the McEwan version's after watching 'Murder at the Vicarage' which indeed was horrendously poor and garish.  But the other McEwan Miss Marple's are fine, even if they do take liberty from the book.  Why not just stop reading the books and just watch entertainment....or just stick with the books.  One or the other without all the pre-conceived notions about how it ""should"" have been.  I have found long ago no screen version can ever match the book I read anyway.  And just because no one single person has stepped forth to present the quintessential Miss Marple does not automatically make Joan Hickson supreme. I frankly cannot stand re-watching Hickson who simply irritated me with her arrogant expressions and gestures as if she smelled rotten fish and her elongated pauses followed by often on-comprehensible dialoge that left me feeling as if ""why don't she just say what she means"". And Margaret Rutherford was just a silly caracature.  So that makes McEwan as good as any Miss Marple. YOU keep the ""washed"" poor quality dvd Hickson Miss Marple's.

I was particularly impressed with Geraldine McEwan's performance.  I just adore her interpretation of Miss Marple.  I love to curl up on my couch with hot cocoa and watch the different episodes.  My only complaint is that I have now seen them all.  Fortunately, I still have a couple of books left to read.

I tried watching the earlier series and just did not feel the same connection.  I can see how it might be easy to become attached to one's own idea of who one believes Miss Marple to be. It seems that once that initial idea is formed it is hard to accept something different.  Maybe that is at least in part responsible for all of the criticism.  Since I had not read the books, Miss Marple is Geraldine McEwan to me.  And I believe this has definitely made the books so appealing for me.

I am shocked at the number of the negative reviews.  I hope the die-hard Christie fans can at least appreciate that Geraldine's performance introduced me to the sharp wit and wondrous world of Miss Jane Marple.",1248220800,6,1274,4.384615384615385

Ms. Hickson might be closer in age and deportment to the book version of Miss Marple, but she is very bland on TV and doesn't give the emotional weight to the story that McEwan does.  And while the Hickson versions may be more faithful to the original story, that's not always a plus.  In ""At Bertram's Hotel"", the McEwan version does add a subplot not in the book but it's very well handled and gives a slow story some pizzazz.  Also, the production values, directing and editing are superior. The Hickson version features scene after scene of people talking over tea (not very entertainingly) and the casting is frankly second-rate.  There's also no contest between the two versions of ""The Moving Finger"" -- McEwan's version is superior in acting, directing, and dialogue to the slow, uninspired Hickson version.

Normally I'm a stickler for adhering to the source, but there's just no comparison between these two Marples.  McEwen is eminently more watchable and her production team is way ahead of Hickson's.",1247184000,6,1109,5.027322404371585

I have to say that I am greatly disappointed in these adaptations.  Not only does this new Miss Marple have a past that seems inconsistent with the books, the entire storyline is a farce.  I was also upset that there is a definite homosexual agenda depicted vividly in several of these movies.  Part of the joy of these books and the former movie adaptations for me has been the ""whodunit"" aspect in the midst of small-town England.  The murders themselves were almost secondary to the unfolding of the great insight of Miss Marple unraveling the depths of human iniquity through the prism of her village experience.  Regardless of your politics on the matter, to change the stories so completely to reflect violence and homosexuality so vividly is NOT a Marple from Agatha Christie's repertoire.

I liked the Joan Hickson ones but these new ones with Geraldine McEwan are wonderful. She plays Marple as a little bit sly and much wittier character and I really like that. She isn't less nosy than Hickson but she doesn't grate on you like Hickson's nosiness tended to do. These episodes were so good that I blocked off an evening and had a Marple night munching popcorn and enjoying life in St Mary Mead.

This all makes me wonder whether or not the screenwriters ever read the original stories. And if the did, there is certainly little if any evidence that they did. Mrs. Christie must be reeling in her grave over the crap that's been made of her art.

The biggest travesty with the entire series to date are the unfounded liberties the writers, producers et. al. have taken with the Christie stories.

I've seen all so far and none, regardless of so-called production values, good acting and the like, remain true to the author. They've even gone and changed the ending in one and maybe another one or two when they're done. Christie's stories were and still are loved for what they were and are ... not for what some producer or director feels in justifying taking such ""artistic license."" I would prefer that a director remain true to a story than be compelled by his/her ego to make a personal imprint on it.

As for the good talent in the tales. Are they all in need of money? Is that why they signed on to do them.

I'm also sorry that the Christie estate would allow any of these to be made.  Surely they aren't in need of money? I'd love to hear their explanation as to why they permitted any of these to be made.

 If you're an honest, true fan then these are not for you and you'll steer clear of them and re-watch Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.  Curiously enough, Miss Hickson died in 1998. To my knowledge, the first McEwan Miss Marple was filmed several years later.",1202256000,16,1657,4.48172757475083

I have enjoyed this series immensely and would recommend it to all. I understand this production may not have stuck to the books, but viewers shouldn't be put off by this in the least.

If you're comparing this series to the older Miss Marple series, you should question what makes a good film. This series is filled with lovable characters, great acting and fun suspenseful stories. I think the majority of viewers will wish Geraldine McEwan was their Aunt Jane, and they will want to watch the rest of the series! I enjoyed the Joan Hickson (1980s Marple series) videos as well. However, they're much dryer, slower, with lesser production values and some mediocre supporting actors. Not true here.

I'd say this is a family friendly series for this point in time. Even though they are murder mysteries I would share them with kids over, say 12 years old, as good family fun. Good enough also for lovers of other PBS Mystery series (though not as hard-boiled as some).

Maybe the older Marple series were good for the 80s. Maybe they're truer to the books. But to Christie devotees who disparage these videos for that reason, I would say lighten up and remember that when stories - considered classics - are around for this long they're going to be re-interpreted. Film is a different media and, like it or not, rarely mimics precisely the text of its inspiration. Though, it's obvious I'm not someone so moved by Christie books as to worry over interpretation.

What is worse is her voice.  She tries to sound old and crotchety, and she can't pull it off.  But worst of all, she lacks the dry wit of the Marple character.  She does not have the personality of Marple.  The trademark quality of the Marple character is this: underneath the guise and pretense of being a bumbling, feebleminded, old woman is really a brilliant, calculated, super sleuth.  The new Marple doesn't put up the facade of the bumbling, feebleminded old woman at all.  Instead, she acts sassy and clever.  This takes the wind out of the sail of the Marple character, because there is no building of a deception or act that she is not who she portrays herself to be.  The end is when she should reveal her true capabilities of unraveling a baffling mystery, but in this series, she gives that away scene by scene during the entire movie. It is evident that she fails to portray her dotty old woman character because none of the other characters treat her like she is a nosy, old busybody who should keep to herself.  Instead, they all willingly answer her questions and then act as if they care about her opinion.  To add insult to injury, the other characters are all unlikable and overplay their parts.  The only qualities which give the illusion that these films are good are the sets, the modern film equipment, and modern filming techniques used.

The ""new"" Miss Marple is a very unappealing characterization indeed. Many od the supporting charcters are as well. Yes, Joan Hickson was far better and will remain the definitive Miss Marple for many, and rightly so. But the new Miss Marple lacks the believability and fragility of the true Miss Marple. It's painful to watch the new stories. Joan Hickson didn't have to pretend to portray the elderly spinster sleuth, it just came natural along with her excellent acting skills. This new portrayal is a big letdown. Perhaps she is just miscast. It's like watching a much younger person try to portray an elderly character, but without all the little quircks one would expect from someone of that age. The stories also seem to have taken a drastic detour down roads that, more often that not, lead absolutely nowhere. One of these stories even drags lesbianism into it.

Geraldine McEwan is simply wonderful, by far the Marple with the most obviously penetrating intelligence, and able to suggest emotional depth far beyond what we're used to seeing in a Christie adaptation.

Controversies about the faithfulness to the originals might be beside the point, as the fact that Christie's classic tales can be reinterpreted once and again, might point out to her greatness as a storyteller.

Other literary qualities might be better left for literary critics to debate.

Storytelling and great characters (no small achievement) are Agatha Christie's greatest strenghts, and they are well served in these 4 adaptations. No wonder that great actors are always drawn to Christie's tales. The casts here are nothing short of spectacular: Derek Jacobi, Janet McTeer, Zoe Wanamaker, David Warner, Tara Fitzgerald, Ian Richardson, Joanna Lumley, James Fox, Simon Callow, Elaine Page, John Hannah, Claire Skinner, Frances Barber, Cherie Lunghi, Keeley Hawes, Celia Imrie, Virginia McKenna, Jane Asher, Miriam Margoyles, Herbert Lom.

And through these wonderful, suspenseful tale, as well as some of her novels, you might still make a case for Christie as a great observer of human behaviour. Above all, in her novels, there is a pervasive atmosphere of evil, generated by lust, greed, jealousy, and sometimes tragically, love.

The final scenes (part of the revisionism, since they are not in the novels) in which the murderers face the ultimate consequence of their crimes in prison add a welcome punch to the usually pastoral settings of the Miss Marple mysteries.

And one final word on Geraldine McEwan's portrayal of Miss Marple. The interpretation might not appeal to everybody, but it's a fascinating one. Yes, the kindness and the warmth are there, but also, in some subtle gestures, comments, looks, a wisdom, maybe a sad one, of the lengths some people will go to get what they want.

If you are a fan of Christie, mystery stories, or just plain good storytelling and great acting, don't miss this.",1170460800,8,1958,5.196825396825397
2252616,1,B0007Y3XRG,"I have been an ardent fan of Agatha Christie and Jane Marple for 40 years or more but if this had been the first Christie movie I had seen it would also have been the last.  I had a hard time recognizing any of the story in this movie.  In fact I stopped and reread the book to be sure I was not completely off track.  This is a perfectly good story ruined by overzealous 'modernization' and revision. Geraldine McKewan certainly makes a poor Jane Marple but this is the first one I have seen her in so she might grow on you after a while.  I liked the way the story developed and the way it was solved  but the story line was completely ruined by the movie.  I suppose the movie would have been better if I hadn't been a Jane Marple fan but she was completely extraneous to the story in this one and really didn't appear to contribute to the story at all.

I was planning to buy both series of these movies but now I will wait for something else.",1168732800,22,947,4.0864864864864865
2252617,5,B0007Y3XRG,"You have to respect the producers of this series - they had the nerve to take a character as beloved as Miss Marple and not only make necessarily-abridged television versions of her adventures, but also to occasionally stray from Agatha Christie's original plotlines. It was a risky gamble, to be sure, but in my opinion the result could not have been better.

I found these 4 episodes (although I object to that term - they really seem more like 4 separate movies) to be utterly addictive. The mysteries themselves are uniformly interesting - they are fun and engaging without being too byzantine, and the solutions are always surprising. The production values are also top-notch - the action always takes place against some glorious 1950s English backdrop (Miss Marple's sleepy village of St. Mary Mead in ""The Murder At The Vicarage"", a palatial seaside resort in ""The Body In The Library""), and the costumes are also absolutely gorgeous. However, what truly sets this series apart is the acting. As Miss Marple, Geraldine McEwan is my favourite portrayal, bar none. She's absoutely charming, she twinkles, she's keen and observant, and she commands the audience's attention without coming across as a ham. I know how beloved the Joan Hickson adaptations are, and although I greatly enjoyed Hickson's portrayal, I feel that McEwan adds a much-needed twinkle or spark that Hickson's oh-so-prim Miss Marple was lacking. The supporting actors, who vary with each episode, are also always inspired choices - a particular favourite of mine was the brassy Joanna Lumley as Dolly Bantry in ""The Murder In The Library.""

I feel as if I must address the most common criticism of this series - that the creators took too many liberties with Christie's original storylines. While changes have been made, I did not find it at all problematic. I should mention that I've read very few Miss Marple books, and so I'm not particularly wedded to the original plotlines, but I view these adaptations as separate entities from the novels, anyways. Like any book-to-screen adaptation, certain things have to be changed. Some things that work in print don't work on screen, and certain aspects of Christie's novels had to be compressed in order to make the storyline work in a 90-minute format. The best book-to-screen adaptations (one of my favourites, Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility"", comes to mind) may change small plot mechanics, but they stay true to the spirit of the original work. In this respect, these new adaptations are a resounding success, for they contain all of Christie's sly wit, humorous commentaries on British society, fully-drawn characters, and of course, thrilling mysteries. I love Agatha Christie's work as much as anyone (I've read many of the Hercule Poirot books, for instance), but I don't think the creators of this series are disrespecting her at all with these adaptations - I think they should be commended for trying to bring Miss Marple to a new audience.

Because of the intricate, engaging storylines and the sunny English settings, these episodes are great to watch in the dead of winter when it's cold and gray, and you just want to curl up on your couch and escape somewhere else for a while. I applaud both the creators and Geraldine McEwan for creating such an engrossing series, and I eagerly await the arrival of my series 2 DVDs in the mail!",1167264000,12,3378,4.975221238938053

It would help if her prevelent expression were not a simpering smile with always a twinkle in her eye.

Take a comparative look at the old and new versions of 'The 4:50 From Paddington' and note the new version's salient characterstics are glitz, a dumbed-down story line, and modern actors in historical drag.

I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED, I LOVE THIS NEW VERSION! After I cautiously viewed the first episode I came to fully appreciate Geraldine McEwan in the role. She is subtle, confident and highly adroit and I find her refreshing and wonderful. The stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing. Some reviewers complained that the scripts don't stick to the originals, but this is not an issue for me here. Christie's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they aren't always done the same way.

as well, and the characters are realistic.  To me, the greatest disappointments in the Acorn Media films are the unnecessary and offensive inclusion of lesbiansism.  The ending of one of the mysteries was even inexcusably changed such that the two people involved with

the crimes are lesbians instead of man and a woman.  Without the

morally offensive aspects of these films, I would have rated them with at least three, possibly four stars.  Without the wonderful attention to detail in the settings, my rating would have been one star.  Geraldine

I have watched each of these 'new' Marples out of a rather morbid curiosity, and have been deeply disappointed each time.  I can't comment on Ms. McEwan's talents, as I don't remember her in other parts.  Here, she appears so addled that one wonders how she finds her own home!  Rather than allowing the plots to set the atmosphere of the episodes, the cameramen have been given full play to show what might pass for sinister, low-placement lighting to create an atmosphere.  Unfortunately, that hasn't worked in movies in decades.  Miss Christie may not have been Dickens for the 20th century, but her great body of work as an aggregate deserves better treatment than this.

(And we must admit, and I'm sorry if this offends, but I don't think the Agatha Christie books were deeply intellectual.... She wanted to tell fast paced, entertaining yarns, and she wasn't too particular about hiding information from her readers that she pulled out at the last  minute.  There, I said it.)

I am currently watching the second series and finding them getting a little cartoony in costume choices and directoral and editing style, as if they are now making fun of the 50s style.  Still fun, and I'll still buy them.  This first season it enjoied inhabiting the 50s style - it is spot on.

But by FAR the worst part is that writers/directors took uncalled for ""liberties"" with the stories.  What gives them the idea that they could improve on Ms. Christie's work?  The stories were perfect as she wrote them, just as much now as when she wrote them.  The screenwriter obviously has some sort of lesbian obsession, so much so that he completely rewrites the ending of ""Body in the Library"", changing the villain to a female character so that he could create a lesbian love affair scene.  I don't understand the reason for the lesbian element, other than the sceenwriter's obsession, as it was not in the book, but what is really unforgivable in my opinion is changing who the villian is.

2252636,4,B0007Y3XRG,"I thought I could never appreciate anyone in the role of Miss Marple more than Joan Hickson, but have been pleasantly surprised to discover Geraldine McEwan (Mapp & Lucia) portrays a wonderful Miss Marple.  I read Chrisite's `Miss Marple' stories back in the 1950s and 1960s and remember feeling a good deal of fright (I was a teenager then, and these were the pre-Psycho days). Although I cannot now remember clearly how I pictured Jane Marple, Joan Hickson relayed in an interview aired on PBS that Agatha Christie once told her, after a West End performance as Miss Marple, that she (Hickson) represented Miss Marple as she (Christie) had envisioned her. Whether this comment was meant only for that particular performance or for all time, I have no idea, but I recommend that you read the books before you view the dramatizations so as to form your own mind's eye view.

Christie was famous for her complex and diabolical plots and as far as I am concerned no writer has ever bested her on this score. The shorter dramatizations in the current film set leave out a good deal of information found in the books and the earlier dramatizations, and I am of the opinion that like fine wine you cannot hurry a good plot. However, the screen play writers have compensated for the tightening of the narrative in the current films by making subtle plot changes, and although none of the critical material has been omitted (the basic plots are still entact), some points might be clearer if you had read the books, and/or seen the older dramatizations.

I think Christie's character development was a little thin and the films compensate for this shortcoming through excellent casting. However, the character development in the longer dramatizations from the 1980s is more thorough than that in the recent offerings. On the other hand, some of the casting for the newer films is more accurate.  To 'improve' the plot, some characters were dropped and others given larger roles.  Dereck Jacobi was badly miscast as the overbearing retired military officer in `Murder at the Vicarage', but Tara Fitzgerald is excellent in her role as the twice-widowed daughter-in-law of Ian Richardson.

Joanna Lumley is wonderful as Jane Marple's friend who invites her to investigate when her husband (Edward Fox) finds a body in his library.  Lumley's character is reminiscent of the 'Aunt' she played in  `Cold Comfort Farm' not the ""burnt out"" hippie of `Absolutely Fabulous'. This particular story is excellently cast with Ian Richardson, Simon Callow, Jack Davenport (Coupling) and Tara Fitzgerald in supporting roles. At one point, when Marple questions one of the hapless witnesses, McEwan reprises the tone of the wicked Mother Superior of the Magdalen Sisters, and thus gives a steely side to Miss Marple that Hickson used to bring forth by pursing her lips and staring disapprovingly with cold blue eyes. The other films in this set include somewhat less stellar but recognizable actors, not the least of which are Zoe Wanamaker and John Hannah.

In sum, the plots of the older versions of `Body in the Library' `4:50 to Paddington' `Murder at the Vicarage' and `The Body in the Library' done in four installments and starring Hickson were better developed in most respects, however, the newer versions with their tighter plots manage to make their point. The filmograhy of the newer versions is beautiful (the older films date from a period when technology was not so ""advanced"" and the films were not well preserved, AND times have changed in England and much of the old countryside is gone, but the camera shoots around the changes). This is an excellent set of films and a better bargain can't be found for Anglophiles who love mystery, however, view the old set and read the books and you will discover nuances that elude the current films. Now, if someone would dramatize `Cat Among the Pigeons'....that was a scary book indeed.",1126310400,12,3922,4.939301972685888

She has this wonderful twinkle of naughtiness in her eyes and a sense of humor just Agatha Christie must have visualized Miss Marple to be.

The village background is astonishingly good. Looks as if photographed probably through a filter; the colors stand out, the reds and blues are vivid. The village is a real English countryside. The setting is pure nostalgia. Acting is uniformly competent, no wonder, given the parade of stars that play the parts.

Now, who thought of focusing on Raymond Chandler's The Simple Art of Murder, as the book Miss Marple was reading in Murder at the Vicarage? Is it a joke? For Chandler disliked village mysteries, hated Christie and Sayers. His article, The Simple Art of Murder lambasted the golden age mystery writers. So why this particular book on Miss Marple's bedside table? And then, consider this, The Simple Art of Murder, the book, a compilation of various Chandler works was not published till 1950! And Murder at the Vicarage was published in 1930 and set in those wonderful and peaceful years before Hitler. Come on, we are all mystery fans and such things cannot be overlooked.

Yes, the whole series is full of more sex, salty language and women in bikinis than previous Christie mysteries (forget the godawful Endless Night)but that's all right. Mrs. Christie was no prude. She, like all good writers of that age, hinted at rather than wrote explicitly about sexual escapades. A lesson to more hard boiled colleagues, her books have survived for more than eighty years; and as things are going, she might become like Shakespeare.

This isn't a minor change either as it involves the resolution of the case.  They also add an odd, on-going storyline involving Miss Marple's own past love life that is simply not part of the books and isn't even close to being in keeping with the character of Miss Marple.  As Agatha Christie is arguably the most acclaimed and accomplished mystery writer that ever lived, these changes were pretty outrageous.  Her books stand the test of time and need no updating simply to satisfy 21st century ideas.

2252641,4,B0007Y3XRG,"Lets get something straight right from the get go: there is no such thing as the definitve film version of Agatha Christie's spinster sleuth Miss Jane Marple.  The closest anyone has ever come to capturing the 'real' Miss Marple is, IMHO, Joan Hickson.  Even so, I don't think Ms. Hickson quite nailed the character down completely, despite the fact that she gives such a wonderful performance.

There have of course been other Miss Marples: Margaret Rutherford, while being completely wrong for the role in every way, was a very humorous and extroverted Marple; Helen Hayes was rather prim and charming; and Angela Lansbury manages to be a rather loopy and eccentric Aunt Jane.  And now we have Geraldine McEwan providing her own interpretation of the character.  While she is still not the definitive Miss Marple she manages to keep the character both fresh and interesting and we should be grateful for that if for nothing else.

I agree with many folks that the producers of this new series should be faulted a bit for trying to provide Jane with a backstory and some of the liberties taken with Christie's original novels are a bit much, even for me.  But at the same time I am grateful that they have tried to give us something a bit different from the other productions.  Something that doesen't just duplicate past interpretations.  In their attempt to make something different and yet still quite familiar to Christie fans I think they succeeded admirably.

Now when I saw the first episode of this series as it aired on PBS I was prepared to wash my hands of the whole thing and not tune in again.  Then I decided to watch the second story (""4:50 From Paddington"" I think) and decided I may have been completely wrong and reactionary in my first opinion.  I really began to warm to McEwan's impish Miss Marple and as I tuned in to further installments I was completely won over.  Then there was the caliber of great British thespians the shows had: Edward Fox, David Warner, Derek Jacobi, Simon Callow and Joanna Lumley (Ab Fab fans will love her role as Miss Marple's good friend Dolly Bantry.  And speaking of ""Ab Fab"" check out the BBC Radio Play adaptation of Miss Marple featuring Eddie's Mom June Whitfield as Jane Marple.  Sadly, only available from the British Amazon.com or the BBC web site shop).  Production values are also very good.  Those great old English houses are wonderful to look at and I also like their use of period music to strike the right period flavor for the show.

All in all I have to say that if you can put aside any preconcieved notions of past interpretations and/or expectations about this new series you may find yourself, like me, succumbing to Geraldine McEwan's particular charms and actually finding many things to celebrate in this all new version of Miss Marple.  Decidedly different but still the same old Aunt Jane we all know and love.  Now, I'm off to put the kettle on and have a nice cup of tea while I sit back and watch ""4:50 From Paddington"" all over again.",1120176000,6,3018,4.669187145557656
2252642,1,B0007Y3XRG,"So many Miss Marples have appeared on the screen, VHS and now on DVD. This is about the most ill cast production I have seen in a long time. Geraldine Mcewan deserves better! She is a very fine actress. The supporting actors are miscast as well.  Nothing  resembles the time period when Agatha Christie wrote her mysteries. The casting director obviously had no clue. He missed the period, wardrobe, mannerism of Miss Christie's characters. With the garish make up, ""Madona"" style of the 1990's, it is not worth the time or money to indulge in this disaster. I can only conclude this was intended for the American audience only.  Let's hope we do not see a New Hercule Poirot.",1119398400,25,676,4.663865546218488

2252644,4,B0007Y3XRG,"My *initial* impression of the new Miss Marple on PBS was that the series was much more fast-paced than the previous version. However I must say my earlier written review was based on that fleeting impression...

I have just begun to re-watch these episodes on DVD and must ask everyone to watch the lengthy Behind-the-Scenes Featurette that is on Volume One, before even watching the episodes. It is really wonderful, there are interviews with the cast members from each episode and they all speak at length about how they see their own characters as well as that of Miss Marple's/Geraldine McEwan. It is fascinating. This featurette will pave the way in how one approaches the series, especially for the ones who may be sceptical. This featurette made me appreciate all the hard work that went into this production and the wonderful cast of established actors who are devoted to their craft.

I think the reasons for such diverging opinions here is that one is either a Joan Hickson fan or is not. It is naturally hard to separate the original storylines we know so well. I definitely had a preconceived idea of what I was expecting in terms of storylines at my first viewing and so it was viewed with a more critical eye than usual.

With a somewhat uneasy past of love unrequited (marvelously poignant portrayal of a young Miss Marple by Julie Cox) and some scenes of lesbianism between the other characters, it might be too much for viewers with conservative tastes. Those scenes also took me by surprise but in itself not a negative, not at all. Please keep in mind that this modern version brings our *own* modern sensibilities into the vintage era -- we are confronted and made to realize how it must have been for people of that time period to deal with dysfunctions, foibles, indiscretions and limitations. Things were much more proper back then, and  appeared very much so outwardly; today's society is so much more relaxed in a sense.

It would behoove audiences to watch McEwan's Marple more than once. McEwan's Marple is most pixie-like, spunky, eccentric, with a knowing twinkle in her eye. There is one scene in Vicarage where Marple gives this look when she has solved another chunk of the mystery -- it had me in hysterics! I won't dare say anymore, it was a gem and truly endeared her character to me. I would love to see Geraldine McEwan in ALL the Marple short stories that are available.... what a fantastic series that would be to have all of Christie's Miss Marple on film!",1119398400,8,2497,4.717889908256881
2252645,1,B0007Y3XRG,"Although this entire new series is hardly worth a gigabyte of virtual ink to review, I feel compelled to comment here as a devoted fan of Agatha Christie's formidable female sleuth. Most obviously, actress Joan Hickson playing Marple in the previous BBC series was the perfect embodiment of the character--combining a quiet strength; fierce intelligence; a dash of dry humor; and when required, an unemotional sense of justice unmoved by the sentimental. Although not all gems, each of the Hickson Marple films were both respectful of their source material and entertainingly executed. Point for point, it is precisely each of these merits that are grossly lacking in the new Marple series. It appears that as a whole, the current outings have been slickly, although not cleverly engineered to cater to the American TV-viewing market. While the cinematography and production/costume design are consistently excellent throughout, the British casts seem to have been encouraged to play their parts to caricatural extremes enough to render them into Clue game pieces. And that brings us to actress Geraldine McEwan's inane portrayal of the lead role. While certainly a competent actress, Miss McEwan's Marple constantly plays her scenes with a mischievous but vacuous grin, obliterating any sense of Christie's serious intention--that the seemingly polite spinster is in fact a personification of Nemesis, bringing evildoers to justice. And space here is too limited to even begin to list the senseless departures from the original (and purposeful!) storylines of Christie's novels. In short, having suffered through the McEwan Marples, one must ask the simple question as to why they even bothered.",1118966400,31,1696,5.428030303030303
2252646,5,B0007Y3XRG,"This version of the iconic detective stories certainly has a modern flair in which the sexual undercurrents of many of the stories are more frank and the central character more prying, even nosey and busy-bodyish. While this does not reflect the exact nature of the novels, the novels certain implied the saliciousness which is so apparent in these films.

 Persoanlly I don't find this as offensive as many Christie purists do, one has to remember the novels were written in times when even hints at salaciousness would have been wholly shocking, especially if penned by a Woman. Though these films are set in the 1950's some of the novels on which they are based, were penned as far back as 1930's.

 A modern visual audience may glean a lot from the nostalgia of these films but they need more to offer a modern audience a greater hook and they do this with the upfront intrigue and allure. Miss Marple too has to come of age and in Mcewan's hands she is given an edgier, grittier side with even a hint at a less than pure past. It is amazing the stories have stood the test of time, undoubtedly some of that is the intrigue in a nostalgic view of an England long gone, equally the stories are complex and full of contemporary resosnance. With this in mind they need renovation for a new and fresh audience every now and again, far better that they are forgotten, and this set of films does so with sympathathetic perfection.",1118620800,8,1428,4.56640625

In all honesty, I've enjoyed them all.  I loved Margaret Rutherford and her hilarious interpretation (although Christie has been quoted as saying that Rutherford was nothing like her idea of Miss Marple) and I adored Joan Hickson (I truly feel she was closest to Agatha's idea of the character).  Now comes Geraldine McEwan (one of my favorite actresses) doing savvy Miss. Marple proud playing her with a little more spunk than the others did.  I love it!  What sparkle she exhibits!  Watch her eyes-they gleam.  I really enjoyed this new interpretation of these stories and failed to see any offensive homosexual displays.  The series is done with the optimum of good taste.  Everyone involved is splendid.  Each episode has a great cast with some of the UK's best actors on display!  Each episode has great direction and camera work.

2252648,4,B0007Y3XRG,"This adaptation of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysteries has more bite than the Joan Hickson films of 1984-1992. Geraldine McEwan's Miss Jane Marple has a sympathetic ear and is always polite, but she doesn't hide her cynicism or incisive nature. She may be closer to Agatha Christie's description of her grandmother and friends who inspired Miss Marple's personality: ""though cheerful, they always expected the worst of everyone and everything and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right."" McEwan's Miss Marple acts like someone trying to appear harmless, but who is actually rather obsessive and tenacious. I'm sure the producers of this Miss Marple series are trying to spice its protagonist up a bit for modern, or younger, audiences. But this Miss Marple isn't likable. While Hickson's Marple was dull, McEwan is scruffy, smirks a lot, and generally looks constipated. I'm giving this series 4 stars, but the episodes vary in quality, and Miss Marple is sometimes grating. The novels upon which the movies are based were written 1930-1957, but they have all been set in the 1950s for this series. Each film is about 90 minutes long.

""The Murder at the Vicarage"" introduces us to Miss Jane Marple (Geraldine McEwan), an elderly spinster with a reputation for amateur sleuthing in her home village of St. Mary Mead. When the stodgy, puritanical, and generally insufferable Colonel Lucius Protheroe (Sir Derek Jacobi) is murdered, there is no shortage of suspects. Inspector Slack (Stephen Tompkinson) investigates the case and finds that Miss Marple is a quick-witted partner in detection and a great help in navigating a maze of false confessions and endless red herrings. This is the least successful film of this series. The salacious aspects of the script seem forced, and Jane Marple's flashbacks reveal that she was a young woman during WWI. Oops, that's impossible, since at least 35 years separate WWI from the time in which the story is set, and Miss Marple appears to be about 70.

In ""The Body in the Library"", Miss Marple is summoned by her friend Dolly Bantry (Joanna Lumley) when a young woman is found murdered in the library of her homel. The body is that of Ruby Keene (Emma Williams), a dancer at a resort hotel in a nearby town. Miss Marple and Dolly set off to the Majestic Hotel to do some sleuthing, as do the official investigators, Chief Constable Melchett (Simon Callow) and Superintendent Harper (Jack Davenport). The trail leads them to the Jefferson family, most of whose members were tragically lost during the War, leaving only a controlling patriarch, Mr. Conway Jefferson (Ian Richardson), and his daughter- and son-in-law, who care for him. I found ""The Body in the Library"" to be the best film of the series, thanks primarily to the supporting cast. Joanna Lumley makes Dolly comic, colorful, sympathetic, and terrifically entertaining. Simon Callow is superb as the gruff, somewhat ill at ease Colonel Melchett. The comic overtones in this mystery make it great fun.

""A Murder Is Announced"" finds Miss Marple vacationing at a spa when a notice appears in the local paper announcing the time and location of a murder that is to take place. Letitia Blacklock (Zoe Wanamaker), whose house is to be the scene of the crime, expects that the notice is a joke that will invite curious neighbors to disturb her evening. So she prepares a party for her uninvited guests, and her drawing room is full by the appointed hour. The lights go out, shots are fired, Leticia is injured, and an intruder is shot to death. Miss Marple's niece, Amy Murgatroyd (Claire Skinner), was present the night of the murder and provides her with lodgings while Miss Marple insinuates herself into the police investigation. The investigation dredges up sordid pasts of the characters who surround Letiticia and turns to the will of the wealthy financier for whom Letiticia was trusted secretary for many years. This film has stirred up some controversy because Amy and her housemate ""Hinch"" are made out to be lovers, but the mystery unfolds nicely.

""What Miss McGillicuddy Saw"" is a dramatization of the novel ""4.50 from Paddington"". Elspeth McGillicuddy (Pam Ferris) is traveling by train to visit her friend Miss Marple when she witnesses a woman being strangled in the compartment of another train, as the tracks run parallel to her train. Railway police investigate, but find no body, so no crime. Miss Marple and Elspeth discover that a body could have been dumped as the train passed the grand Rutherford Hall, home to the Crackenthorpe family. Miss Marple engages her intrepid, stylish niece Lucy Eyelesbarrow (Amanda Holden) to take on the job of cook at Rutherford Hall and do some snooping, while Marple stays nearby at the home of Detective Inspector Campbell (John Hannah). The Crackenthorpe family has an ornery patriarch, 3 sons who don't like one another, a long-suffering daughter, and a secret -and the largest private home I've ever seen. Lucy does most of the investigating in this film, and I found her a little too precious, but the family are an entertaining lot.

The DVDs (Acorn Media 4-disc set, 2005): There is one movie per disc, and each disc includes a Photo Gallery, which is a 1-minute slideshow of stills and on-set photos from the movie, as well as selected filmographies for 5-6 cast members. Additional bonus features are found on Disc 1: ""Behind the Scenes Featurette"" (1 hour) dedicates 15 minutes to each of the films and includes interviews with cast members and Geraldine McEwan, who talks about Miss Marple.

2252649,5,B0007Y3XRG,"Having been a fan of Agatha Christie's since reading her mysteries in the seventies and like most readers, I had a firm picture of Miss Marple in my mind. The first Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) was a travesty as far as I was concerned. But the second (Joan Hickson) was wonderful. I have all of her work. When they came out with a new Marple I thought I would find it hard to switch loyalties, but no! Geraldine McEwan is so much fun. With the first scene I was totally sold. She alone makes this set worth the price. But the sets are lavish, especially in my favorites ""4:50"" and ""Body in the Library"". There are some twists that make the episodes fresh. And to see some of my favorite English actors, Simon Callow and John Hannah at the top of that list, having a wonderful time with their characters adds icing to a wonderful cake. I will buy anything in this series without hesitation. May they do all 12 novels, all the short stories and make up their own!",1117497600,9,966,4.372222222222222
2252650,2,B0007Y3XRG,"The ratings seem to indicate that people either love or hate this series. Perhaps that is because this edition of Marple mysteries appears clearly to have been produced with the goal of ""updating"" the old girl--but, as the British are won't to say, it often looks like ""mutton dressed as lamb.""

Miss Hickson or Miss McEwan? Now, the latter did have the Marple ""twinkle"" that Christie mentions occassionally, and the ""fluffy"" appearance that is also a passing description in the novels (though it sometimes looked more like a curly perm gone bad). The scene where McEwan sobs in the rain after finding the strangled body of her friend's daughter was deeply moving.

However, I'm afraid that Miss Hickson must win my vote as the more accurate of the two. I believe that it is implied in the novels that Miss Marple was a clergyman's daughter; because her sense of right was strong, so was her sense of wrong. Moreover, such an upbringing in Edwardaian England would also have made her poised in just about any social setting, from a cottage to a castle. Miss McEwan's Marple, alas, does not seem to have that touch of transcedant class that Miss Hickson's did; I certainly don't remember the character ever saying, ""Call me Jane.""

However, the series wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, based on what I had heard beforehand, and if it gets ""the younger crowd"" interested in Christie and inspired to write their own intriguing and sometimes humorous mysteries, they shall have served a good purposes.",1116979200,16,1503,4.795366795366795

However, I have to agree with previous reviewers who couldn't come to terms with the new Marple.  Geraldine McEwan's portrayal is very far from the character Christie created and the stories have been so mutilated that in some cases they are hardly recognizable.  For my money, you can't improve upon Joan Hickson in the title  role and this new version lacks the subtlty, faint air of menace, wry humor and sharpness of the Hickson productions.  Yes, the new series is more ""colorful"", flashy, even,  with a stream of well-known actors flowing through in character roles but many of them are ill-cast (e.g., Stephen Tomlinson as Inspector Slack) and their characters seem more like charicatures or cartoon figures.  Miss Marple has been transformed into  a much less remarkable person, with a rather routine romantic past and without the same shadowy, razor-sharp intelligence honed by experience with the people living in her small village.  Overall, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they came up with this unrecognizable mish-mash and had the effrontery to call it ""Agatha Christie's"" Marple.

2252655,1,B0007Y3XRG,"If the adaptations of ""Murder at the Vicarage"" and ""A Murder is Announced"" are any sign of what is to come, fans of Christie should look elsewhere for enjoyment.  One of the major elements that help any adaptation to succeed is the effort to remain true at least to the spirit of the novels.  These adaptations fail miserably in this respect.

1. Miss Marple's interest in mysteries flows less from her familiarity with human evil as exprienced in St Mary Mead than from her interest in reading Raymond Chandler and being an overall rather chipper busybody.

2. Characters are ""dolled up"" to look like what some contemporary designer imagines contemporary ""fashionable"" people would have worn in ""fashionable"" circles in the early 1950s.  (Thus, an overtly lesbian character looks more like k d lang than what any imaginable inhabitant (lesbian or otherwise) of Chipping Cleghorn would have worn in the world created by Christie.

3. There's an unfortunate effort to ""update"" Christie's material, at least in terms of social sensibility--making McEwan's Marple a woman whose married lover died during the Great War and, therefore, a non-judgmental precursor to faddish contemporary worldviews.

All in all, this set of adaptations reminds one of a chessboard populated by vaguely familiar chesspieces, but all playing a game whose rules have changed so dramatically that it no longer approximates the interesting game created by Christie herself.

Avoid this nonsense and purchase the infinitely superior Joan Hickson adaptations.",1115683200,75,1530,5.319502074688796
2252656,2,B0007Y3XRG,"I have not read Agatha Christie's A Murder is Announced. I can only compare this new adaptation, staring Geraldine McEwan, to the 1985 Joan Hickson adaptation. Perhaps that's the problem. Hickson seemed spot on in the role of Marple, and the adaptations so classy, perhaps I cannot imagine someone else in the role. (Imagine someone other than Suchet doing Poirot.)

Or, perhaps this new interpretation just isn't good -- That could be it.

What bothered me about this new version of a Murder is Announced:

1)Some characters were removed while new relationships were added. This includes an affair that never existed in the old book.

2)More scenery chewing than during the making of Mr. Ed. Really, this is hammy stuff.

3)More yelling, knife pulling, etc. than required to make a Miss Marple blush; the climax-confrontation with the killer is badly done, an odd series of emotional ventings.

4)A spunky Miss Marple in the vein of Jessica Fletcher, as another reviewer mentioned (as apposed to the Miss Marple Christie created). I like Jessica Fletcher, but Miss Marple is a different character.

Clearly, those making these adaptations began with a flawed concept: Agatha Christie's work needs to be updated for our modern standards -- there needs to be more conflict ... Much, much more conflict. Maybe you agree? If so, then you might like this series.

The casting is not very good and few of the actors match their part.  Several scenes of graphic homosexual physical affection have been added.

There is a technical flaw of the audio and video not being exactly synchronized.  It is most obvious when the people's  mouths do not move properly to match what they say.

After viewing this several times I noticed why it seemed simplified.  The characters are stupid.  Even Miss Marple comes across as an airhead who blurts out smart sentences every so often.  Also there appears to be some ethical preaching.  Everyone who has any moral standards is ridiculed.  There is a lot of cigarette smoking.

Acorn, the official distributor of Marple in America is responsible for the streaming video here and, for no reason I can fathom, have completely dropped the ball. As a fan of Marple, all Marple, I have seen this many times in many formats. From original airings to the Region 1 / NTSC / USA DVD release to the Blu-ray release in Spain and HD streaming from Netflix and Hulu, I have watched every version of this. I purchased these episodes because I put them on so often it was getting annoying putting the Blu-ray in over and over. It was a waste of money.

This video and audio is the lowest quality I have seen. The sound is somewhat muddled and muted and has too much bass. It has to be turned up to hear dialogue properly but, when turning it up, the bass gets even louder. The video is a TV tragedy. This is available in HD transfer so why they chose SD is beyond me. However, SD can and often does look very good on a quality, upscaling HD television set. That is not the case with this transfer. Where the DVDs, from Acorn, look fairly good, with vibrant colors, though not as bright as on Blu-ray, and an excellent absence of odd pixellation, this video is fuzzy, pixellates often (not from any streaming issue, as it happens in the same places each viewing) and the colors are muted even as compared to the DVD. The best example of this color issue is Miss Marple herself. Her clothing and the redness in the tissue of her inner eyelids are all the wrong color, throughout.

Acorn, again, for whatever reason, just didn't bother with a decent transfer and, though they are passing this off as the official Acorn version, it is clearly not the same digital transfer as from their own DVD. Wherever the Netflix and Hulu HD versions came from, from what I could tell, identical to the Region B Blu-ray, is the transfer that is worth viewing. My recommendation, for what it's worth, is to purchase a used DVD or, if you have a Region free player, get the Blu-ray. Don't pay Acorn for their failure to care about the needs of their audience. They didn't bother doing a proper job on this one and it really shows. Good luck finding what works best for you.",1513382400,3,2333,4.38337182448037
