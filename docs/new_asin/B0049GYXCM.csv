4290116,3,B0049GYXCM,"First of all, I like baby Einstein...but, this video was not up to par with other releases I have purchased. It was kind of boring and not as cute as world music or Beethoven.",1323388800,,175,4.176470588235294
4290117,5,B0049GYXCM,"Another great BE video.  My little one (almost 1 year old now) absolutely loves the video and the flash cards.  Some of the songs actually have words now, which really seems to engage her more than just the music of previous videos.",1309392000,5,232,4.5
4290118,5,B0049GYXCM,"One of the first Baby Einstein DVDs I have ever bought, which will lead to purchasing many more discs in the future! My 10-month-old will stop everything he's doing to watch the ocean scenes and animals, and usually laughs at the puppet introduction scenes to each section of the video. The only negative I can report is that he was so entranced by the DVD, that when the shark section arrived, and the puppet ""Neptune"" jumps up in the middle of the screen, he screams - every single time. Unfortunately for him, mommy and daddy find this a little entertaining, so we keep playing it. Poor little guy. Great DVD! Allows mommies just enough time to cram a breakfast or lunch in for themselves off in the corner. :)",1301875200,11,713,4.534883720930233
4290119,5,B0049GYXCM,"I purchased this kit as a Christmas gift for my 16 month old grandson, Noah. I received it in a timely manner , in time for Christmas. He loves it and picks up the remote control, stands in front of the t.v. and tries to get someone's attention to turn on his DVD! So cute! It also gives a tired adult a full 28 minutes of respite while he watches it nonstop! I'll be looking for others to order him soon!",1362182400,,405,4.012345679012346
4290120,5,B0049GYXCM,"These DVDs create a peaceful, restful alternative to some of the cartoons on TV today. I have't seen this one, but I have viewed others and watched 1-3 year olds enjoying them.",1359244800,,176,4.53125
4290121,5,B0049GYXCM,I showed the video to a 1 year old and 2 1/2 year old and they both loved the pictures and were very involved in the video.  The  older girl also loves listening to the music in the car.,1357516800,,186,3.7435897435897436
4290122,4,B0049GYXCM,"Another great DVD from Baby Einstein. The only reason I'm not rating the product with 5 stars is my 7 month old didn't ""love it"" as much as the Beethoven DVD.  All of these DVDs are a great way to fill voids with good entertainment.",1356652800,,232,4.155555555555556
4290123,5,B0049GYXCM,"We own the 26 disc collection of Baby Einstein!! Having watched them many of times for the past year with my daughter Emily, we were searching for new ones!!
I came across these discovery kits (9 total),  and ofcoarse wanted them all at 1st!!
We now own 4: Neptunes Ocean,  Animals around me, Wild animal safari, and World of rhythm..
Neptunes ocean is different mostly, world of rhythm is totally different from original 26 dvds... however, animals around me, wild animal safari are mostly clips from originals.
Haven't bought the others either because they have already been published..
Hope the baby einstein moms find this helpful if you are looking for new einsteins!!!!",1351728000,,675,4.964601769911504
4290124,5,B0049GYXCM,"All the Baby Einstein videos are amazing! Ever since our little one was born we have put these on in the mornings to get his little senses going and he is one of the most happiest babies I've ever known (not partial or anything :). He smiles at the skits in the shows and laughs at the funny parts and just watches so intently on the rest of the show like a little sponge absorbing it all.  He can't get enough!! Now at 1 year old he is extremely alert, understands so many words and is one of the best babies his daycare has.  He actually has an attention span where as many 1yr olds don't.  He can sit and play with a toy for a good 15 minutes and then find another one.  He is independent and is clearly expressive (not a tantrum thrower)about what he wants and understands interactions between himself and adults as well as other children.  He likes other videos and children's shows but Baby Einstein is the only one he watches like its going out of style.  The videos give mom or dad enough time to eat, get ready, or cook a quick dinner without little hands into everything and without the risk of commercials! I'd recomend just about any of the dvd's!!!",1346198400,,1161,4.302752293577981
4290125,5,B0049GYXCM,"Whenever my 2 1/2 year old Grandson comes over and it's ""movie time"", he ALWAYS chooses NEPTUNES OCEAN. We go over the names of the various fish, and the reef is so colorful!! Honestly he never gets tired of watching it and I enjoy watching it with him!! It was the best purchase I made for him. He laughs out loud at the turtle in between the scenes.",1334880000,,351,4.176470588235294
4290126,5,B0049GYXCM,"My granddaughter and I love these videos (have the animals around me too), but purchased one for my nephew in England as a Christmas present.  Took over our videos to England and found out that they are incompatible.  The Juno series of videos that we both love do work over there.",1326844800,,281,4.490196078431373

8419070,5,B0049GYXCM,All of the Baby Einstein DVD's are fantastic. We love them.  The music is so soothing and comforting and the pictures are so clear and defined.,1385683200,,143,4.5
8419071,5,B0049GYXCM,My son loves watching Baby Einstein movies. This is one of his favorites and we take them in the car for long trips to keep him occupied.,1384387200,,137,4.111111111111111
8419072,5,B0049GYXCM,To me the producers of these DVDs have really done an excellent job.  There are some childrens DVDs that are for entertainment only and others that use entertainment to educate.  That is what you will find with all the Baby Einsteir DVDs.  My grandson just soaks up the presentations and takes along the simply presented concepts of numbers and colors and many more.,1372982400,,366,4.777777777777778
8419073,3,B0049GYXCM,The DVD is too short! It is good for babies and small children. The cards are nice as well. Overall value is less than what I bought it for ($15.00) just because it is not long enough (I think total around 25 min) and few cards.,1371427200,,228,3.9782608695652173
8419074,5,B0049GYXCM,"A friend gave one of the baby Einstein DVD's (Baby Mozart) and our son loved it. We've picked a few others up and he has enjoyed each one. He is really into the animals but also the audio CD is excellent when riding in the car. He is enjoying Mozart and Bach when we drive somewhere.....not sure it will last forever, I dread the day he want to listen to something like Justin Bieber, but for now it is nice",1367020800,,407,4.1
8419075,5,B0049GYXCM,"Baby Einstein videos never disappoint.  Cute vids, bought the whole set.  My son likes this one the best.  Nice having the music for in the car too.",1366243200,,148,4.407407407407407
