5939763,2,B00ESFCETS,"hi i'm LETTING EVERYONE KNOW I""M SOMEWHAT DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS DVD COMPLETE COLLECTION OF THE MOD SQUAD! IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE RETURN OF THE MOD---AS INDICATED IN FACT THERE IS know MENTION OF IT AT ALL AND IT IS NOT 40 DISCS EITHER it is only 39 DISCS --THE RETURN OF THE MOD SQUAD COMPLETE COLLECTION IS MISSING????? how come",1385251200,7,331,4.442622950819672
5939764,5,B00ESFCETS,"What can I say, it's the Mod Squad! My favorite show since it came out, the good old days! This is a great edition!",1385251200,22,115,3.8333333333333335
5939765,4,B00ESFCETS,"I remember watching this complete series when it was on ABC from 1968-73 but hadn't seen it again until I received a ""sample DVD"" from the folks at VEI (who took over releasing it after CBS Home Video stopped operating.). They have been releasing the individual seasons (each in two parts) and there are plenty of reviews by others of those. It appears that this is the first review of the COMPLETE set - which will be released on 11/19. I'm guessing that this is for the holiday buying season.  The box set includes four ""bonus featurettes"" which were produced by CBS when they began their reissues.

Journalists were provided with a single DVD screener with three episodes (including the first one that runs 73 minutes (versus the normal 46 minutes; remember commercials have been excised). Two of the featurettes were included: First was the ""Forming the Squad"" one which runs nine minutes. The other is ""Inside `The Teeth of the Barracuda'"" (13 minutes) which discusses each character. The interviews are with both Peggy Lipton and Michael Cole and both were filmed at the same time.

The image quality is decent - no change from the CBS volumes.

So,  if you have been buying many of the sets individually , you probably don't need this full box - nothing new here. But it may be the only way to get ALL the seasons, since they seem to have stopped the individual ones at Season 5.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful (well, as much as I had to work with)

5939783,5,B00ESFCETS,"Love this box set! We were hesitant to purchase this particular packaging, but much to our surprise we are very please with this set up. Most sets that are at the lower end of the cost factor, have paper sleeves and simply don't hold up, but this set has the individual seasons in traditional dvd cases, that fit neatly into the storage box.

The transfers are clean and everything plays perfectly.

This is a good value for the money and I highly recommend this version for the collector.",1502236800,4,489,4.545454545454546

5939788,4,B00ESFCETS,"This show was a bit before my time but, my, how the quality of the writing and the obvious chemistry of the actors pulls you in.

Unlike the earlier 36-disc VEI set that seized up in places, this 20-disc one has played where that one did not. I'm only beginning season 2, though.

So why not 5 stars? Because of the obvious video compression that occurred in reducing the number of discs. The image quality is still very decent (on my 14"" laptop), but that's because the video seen on the 36-disc almost seems like HD! So in this 20 disc version the darker parts of the image show artifacts or a bit of pixilation not at all noticeable in the original VEI box set. Also, the sound level for the episodes is half that of the original VEI set.

No regrets on buying this set if the DVDs play well all the way through. I do worry once I watch on a 60"" 4K set, whether the video quality will become much more noticeable and distracting. That would be a shame because the quality of the Mod Squad master tapes begs for a Blu-ray presentation.",1498348800,4,1037,4.280612244897959

5939794,4,B00ESFCETS,"This is a great ""old school"" cop show.  If you like the original Hawaii Five-O and Starsky & Hutch, you will like Mod Squad.  Great camera angles and original, interesting plots that deal with the issues of late 1960s early 1970s.  The only problem I've found is in the physical quality of the DVDs.  Some episodes will play half-way through and then ""freeze.""  The only way to get out of it is to eject disc and start over.  You can't skip or fast forward through the frozen part of the disc...it will only play up to that point.  These are new discs, no scratches or aberrations.  I can't explain it.  Between season 1 and season 2 I've had two episodes lock up.  I had season 1 from another vendor and it did the same, but not in the same place as on these discs so between the two sets I was able to watch all Season 1 episodes.  Don't let that dissuade you from buying, though, it's otherwise a great show if you are willing to tolerate a few freeze-ups.",1496966400,4,959,4.272222222222222

5939797,5,B00ESFCETS,I was very happy with this complete set of mod squad. All episodes are 51 52 min. Great color and sound. Vci. did a nice job on the transfers  the case and box could have been made better. But for $27.95  I am not complaining. Wish they would have included the return of the mod squad.

5939802,5,B00ESFCETS,"I was in high school when this show first came out, and would watch it every week.  The 20 disks in this set are one-sided with 6 or 7 50+ minute episodes per disk.  I was expecting a lot of compression to fit this much on one disk and that the picture and/or sound would be degraded due to the compression level.  Well, no need to be concerned with that.  The picture is clean, detailed and good color.  The sound is also clean, clear and in synch. The disks are stored 2 per spindle, and are easy to remove.  No sleeves to slide into (and to scratch the disks).  I'm very happy with this purchase.",1493856000,13,599,4.156521739130435

5939817,5,B00ESFCETS,"The Mod Squad was the first show to break ground for shows like Charlie's Angels, Nancy Drew / Hardy Boys Mysteries & 21 Jump Street. Just to name a few. The Mod Squad complete series is worth having! The color on these discs are great, the sound is great and plenty of extras. Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes! Get this while it's cheap.

5939818,5,B00ESFCETS,"There are few TV shows that match the MOD SQUAD. No predictability like most cop-drama TV shows. Most know why it is unique and that Spelling/Thomas took a real chance airing this in 1968. Every episode has a unique twist. The actors are superb and most episodes deal with the crisis' and issues of that time head on. Aaron Spelling and Danny Thomas were two of the best and it shows. Note that the vendor, VEI was contacted about two DVDs I had issues with (frozen scenes, etc). An email on a Sunday morning resulted in a response that same afternoon with an apology and replacement of the two DVDs sent asap. Great from every perspective. ENJOY!",1480291200,4,647,4.538461538461538
5939819,5,B00ESFCETS,"I love this DVD set. The quality is excellent. However, when I was removing the packaging from some of the individual DVD cases, I noticed that one of my Season 5 cases was not there, and that I had a duplicate of another case. I contacted the seller and they immediately offered to send me the copy I was missing without me having to return the duplicate case.
They have amazing customer service, so if you have any issues just tell them! I will be looking at their other products in the future when I have a craving for classic TV.",1477958400,5,533,4.287128712871287

I watched so I could see Peggy Lipton as Julie Barnes--she's still my favorite. I always thought 'how cool--she has my mother's name.' My mother died of cancer in 2005 and her name was Peggy. The show was unusual for a cop show--even though it didn't play like any cop show. The actors were real. The people were real. The situations and attitudes were real. Even though this show came along in the 60s, I still rate this as a No #1 favorite from what became known as The Summer Of Love or The Age Of Aquarius.",1440720000,5,677,4.136363636363637

5939853,5,B00ESFCETS,"It was more than just about being 'mod'. The Mod Squad took on issues that other shows of that time never even touched: war, racism, abortion, revolution, sex education, drugs, and they did it with great dialogue, music and action. But the main thing that The Mod Squad was about was family; Pete, Linc, and Julie either ran away or were kicked out of their homes. When they accepted the job, they didn't know that slowly, as trust between them grew, a deep love would follow, and they became a real family  --  and in time, with Captain Greer as well. I can't think of another show from the 60's that was as gripping, or as moving.

The guy who answered the phone seemed competent, yet days later I never got the call back I was promised. I returned that set and got another. (Amazon had it to me the next day.) Same problems as with the first box and on the same disks. I hate that I had to send both back. BTW - A friend has the original issues of when these first came to disks, done by a different producer.

5939863,5,B00ESFCETS,"To quote Linc Hayes, I could sum up my review of The Mod Squad in just one word... ""solid!"" But I'll go a bit more in-depth than that. I'll review this set as seasons one and two first, then three, four, and five second, as they almost feel like two different sets, quality-wise. Read on, and this will all make more sense.

First, seasons one are two are in superb, pristine condition. I viewed this set through an HDMI upconverting Blu-Ray player on a Sony LCD HDTV, and I was blown away by the video quality. Blemish-free and bright and sharp and crystal-clear. The audio was also top-notch. And thankfully, both the audio and video were presented as originally broadcast (mono audio and 4x3 video). I hate it when the studios feel the need to create a faux surround sound or widescreen version of a show that was not recorded that way. Give us purists the original audio and video, I say. And that's what we get with this set. Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the episodes do contain English closed captions. This was not mentioned on the package. And lastly, the episodes all clock in around 51 minutes (accurate and complete for a show from the late '60s, early '70s), and once we're finished watching the episodes we get nice interviews with Peggy Lipton and Michael Cole.

Now, we move to the remaining seasons. Things diminish a bit here, unfortunately. The image is noticeably lower in quality (though still better than some TV shows I've seen from the '80s and '90s on DVD) and a bit washed out. It appears to me as if these episodes might have been taken from videotape masters, as opposed to film. I also had to crank up the volume a tad more to hear some of the dialogue. Time-wise, most of the episodes clocked in around 50 or 51 minutes, but a few hovered around the 49-minute mark. This tells me that there was most likely a small scene cut out, but these are still (thankfully) not the syndicated versions, as they clock in around 45 minutes. There are no captions to be found for these seasons, unfortunately.

Despite the shortcomings of seasons three through five, I'm still giving this set five stars for three reasons:
1.) It's The Mod Squad, as full and complete and high-quality as we're likely ever to get,
2.) They actually went through the trouble of assembling most of the surviving cast members for interviews, something which very few studios do for vintage TV shows on DVD, and
3.) The packaging is very... dare I say... solid! Each season's box and DVDs are a different color, and whole presentation is very top-notch and professional. Kudos to VEI for a job very well done!",1432080000,9,2620,4.594017094017094
5939864,4,B00ESFCETS,"Love the series, was glad to get all five seasons on DVD. The mass produced disks are finicky, and don't like all players. Good transfers, chaptering is accurate. Could have used more bonus features. A good value though.",1431820800,2,220,4.815789473684211
5939865,5,B00ESFCETS,"This is a terrific boxed set of DVDs from a time when young cops were dynamic and cool.  So different from today.  Perhaps it was just an illusion, but their friendly style and forward thinking go the job done!  Enjoy!",1431820800,,218,4.4
5939866,5,B00ESFCETS,"great price, complete seasons and all played well. Some appeared to have been recorded off of better tapes but I have a full 4k system and every episode was good to almost like it was filmed yesterday.",1430611200,,201,4.45945945945946
5939867,5,B00ESFCETS,"The Mod Squad attempted to explore new ground, with a very stylized take on undercover police work during the late 60's.  Starring Tige Andrews, Michael Cole, Clarence Williams III, and Julie Lipton, the program featured a trio of formerly misguided hippie types, recruited and transformed into undercover cops.  Very much a product of its time, The Mod Squad ran on ABC for 5 seasons, producing 124 episodes.

Starting in 2007 The Mod Squad was released on DVD in half season sets, roughly priced at $25 each.  It took until the fall of 2013, for all five seasons to be released.  Dedicated fans who bought these sets, could have paid as much as $250 for the entire series.  The half season sets, were then repackaged as full season sets, and sold for about $20 each.  Those who purchased the series this way, may have paid only about $100.

In late 2013, the entire series was released as a collectable boxed set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mod-Squad-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00ESFCETS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mod Squad: The Complete Collection</a>, and also in this more basic form, which consists of the five repackaged season sets, securely housed in a slipcase.  Both sets contain 124 episodes, on 39 DVD's.  Unfortunately, dedicated fans may have paid a premium, but for those who waited, the basic set is a wonderfully compact space saving bargain.

Although I bought several of the half season sets, I could not see playing $250 for the entire series.  When the price of this set eventually fell to $49.99, I took the pulled the trigger, and I have not been disappointed.

Each disc typically contains three episodes, and image quality is better than average for a program from this era.  There isn't a wealth of DVD extras, but you do get to hear from stars Michael Cole and Julie Lipton, who speak about things like the cast's opposition to using firearms.  Inspired by the free spirited California lifestyle of the late sixties, The Mod Squad often dealt with provocative issues, some which are still relevant today.  Today, the program might be regarded as an idealistic take, on a very unique period in time.  If you're a fan or just interested in the series, this set is a tremendous value buy at the current price level.",1429142400,2,2289,5.093833780160858

The action scenes are exciting.  The mysteries are engrossing.  I'll just warn you of two things: (1) the pace is less frenzied than modern TV or cinema, and this takes some getting used to; (2) the character of Julie Barnes, while very courageous, risking her life on a regular basis, is nonetheless a far cry from, say, the Black Widow of recent Marvel films, as Julie never engages in hand to hand combat and her male partners always try to bear the brunt of any danger unto themselves.  On the plus side, all four characters are intensely moral while also being deeply questioning of where exactly the line between right and wrong truly falls, and inevitably they come down on the side of compassion, truth, and fairness.

Spanning 39 DVDs you get the entire series from the first episode to the last who could ask for anything more except maybe the return of the mod squad TV movie from 78 would be the only thing left out!  I have been a fan since the 70's and have waited for this release for decades. In the mid 80s we go some teaser on VHS. The Teeth of Barrcuda pilot on tape and new line release 6 vhs tapes of episodes and that was it! Then we had the DVDs come out a few years ago and once again we go just two seasons and it stalled again. Finally we have all 5 years worth of the mod squad in on place! I would suggest you grab this set now before this too fades into obscurity!

Classic Aaron Spelling format and style, its been great recently with the boxed sets and Hulu Plus to revisit shows from my youth. But to see these shows in DVD quality when we didn't get color TV until August 1971 is one of the best aspects. And I'm an admittedly rabid car guy, and so I'm constantly checking out the wheels.
