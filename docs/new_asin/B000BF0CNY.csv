8085755,4,B000BF0CNY,"I enjoyed this series so much when it aired on the History Channel that I wanted to get as many of the episodes as possible. But check before purchase because a lot of them are included in other sets. This was included in another set that I purchased at the same time, but since my son also enjoys this series, I will be passing the duplicates to him.",1415923200,,351,4.176470588235294
8085756,5,B000BF0CNY,I was always a big fan when Mysteries of the Bible used to air weekly on A&E.  I was saddened when it no longer was available on A&E.  I am very thankful they have provided this series on DVD.  I am enjoying this DVD series very much.  I always enjoyed the narration by Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons.  Very well done.,1209254400,9,318,4.147540983606557
