8310556,4,B001DLUC5I,"A collection of people bring their ideas to venture capitalist in an effort to get some funding. Occasional insight. One person is so worked up they can hardly talk. Some of the negotiating appears to be too petty. Clothing, baby products, advertising.",1484611200,,252,5.023809523809524
8310557,3,B001DLUC5I,"Although the description of the item clearly states that it is Region 2 (Europe) and not Region 1 (US & Canada), I still managed to miss that detail. No big deal though if you have an Xbox or a PC to play it on. It just won't work in US DVD players (some PC DVD drives won't work with it either, but most will).

As far as the show goes, it is not as entertaining as Shark Tank in the US. The Dragon's very rarely invest in anything, and most of the business ideas are not very interesting. The Dragons also don't have as much personality as the Sharks. They are also quite a bit ruder. That said, it is a nice change from Shark Tank in small doses. It is interesting to see the differences in business between the UK and US. For example, distribution is much different: the total land area of the UK is smaller, but, consequently, you have fewer potential customers for niche products.

It's worth a watch if you're curious, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a die-hard fan.",1365379200,2,983,4.308108108108108

I wish they'd make a series on following up on how the investments turned out.

You can learn from watching these self made millionaires.",1351900800,,261,4.777777777777778
