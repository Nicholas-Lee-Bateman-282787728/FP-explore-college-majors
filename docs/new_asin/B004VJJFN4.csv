4482647,4,B004VJJFN4,"No mysteries, a better name is History at the Museums.  This is several mini documentaries about stuff at museums.  Some of these mini documentaries are very interesting and you will wish for more time on that subject.  Other mini documentaries you will push the skip button.  Four stars because the good outnumber the bad.",1420848000,3,323,4.925925925925926

4482649,5,B004VJJFN4,Same with the season 2,1414627200,,22,3.6
4482650,2,B004VJJFN4,"Maybe it's my age but I already know about almost all of these ""mysteries,"" and most of them are just plain boring and not so mysterious. In fact, a lot of them I read about in the newspaper when they happened---way back when.

Further, you've got ""haunted"" dolls, haunted houses, haunted trunks, and other objects, where there is no proof or credible witness. I mean, to me that's a waste of time. I might as well read faery tales. It's very Twilight Zoney---1963.

Also, the host narrates and appears in these episodes. They have him dressed in super-masculine ""rugged"" clothing, with a a three-day beard and short hair. He is always walking---walking across a room, walking down a hall, walking at you, walking, walking, walking, never stands still, and all the while he is talking, talking, talking---narrating.

You know, like the phony tv reporter-walk when they really have nothing to say---they will walk at you. And talk. The guy you hate.

The host contributes nothing and is much better narrating unseen.

The series is quite mediocre and very hard to sit through. I can barely sit still. I go on the iPad; I play witht the dog...I put it on pause and leave it there for a half hour....",1413158400,7,1197,4.708133971291866
4482651,5,B004VJJFN4,"Absolutely loved this and will be ordering more. Great for learning and our ""bucket list"" for our next trip to the USA is growing! I can't recall a quality series like this being on TV. Should be more of it instead of all those stupid reality shows which are an insult to one's intelligence.",1413072000,,291,4.407407407407407
4482652,5,B004VJJFN4,"Love this show, cant wait to watch the next season.",1410825600,,51,4.2
4482653,4,B004VJJFN4,This is an awesome series! There are 3 discs with 4 episodes; each episode talks about 4-5 mysteries. These mysteries can be about anything! Little tidbits that people might not know such as; Ford built a pie-shaped house but didn't have the financing to see it through or about how the Chicago fire actually got started or Amelia Earhart's plan to cross the Pacific ocean first was changed last minute to going over the Atlantic first instead. I learned a LOT about history and things that I never knew about. This is great for the whole family especially history buffs!,1405296000,9,571,4.72
4482654,5,B004VJJFN4,"Bought this Season1 and Season 2 for a birthday gift. Since my hubby and I love these series, it was wonderful gift for someone who loves histories and its hidden secrets. Good Show!",1402531200,,182,4.545454545454546
4482655,4,B004VJJFN4,"I love how uninteresting artifacts are chosen and the history comes to life. It is very addicting. I am left wanting to buy all seasons. I hope they continue, educational and fun.",1397520000,,179,4.625
4482656,5,B004VJJFN4,"Bought in conjunction with season 2, top show, very interesting stories, each episode a hit in my opinion, no duds. Quick delivery, packaged well, highly recommend this show and seller.",1397347200,2,185,5.2
4482657,5,B004VJJFN4,Fast shipping. Good price. Interesting and fascinating DVD made for fun watching. We may get the rest of the series eventually.,1395532800,,127,5.095238095238095
4482658,5,B004VJJFN4,Here is a cool video to learn what is out there in local museums that you may not even know of.  I learned a lot about museums I have been to and didn't even know what I was seeing.  A must for any museum geek give it a try,1390867200,2,223,3.5306122448979593
4482659,5,B004VJJFN4,Another awesome show sort of pisses me off that its not free with the amazon prime.  I just love this sort of thing seems that so many of the shows I am interested in Amazon wants to charge money for me to watch even after I paid for the amazon prime membership..really makes me consider dropping the prime pretty often since I feel I shouldn't have to pay to watch most of what I want...and I have netflix..I feel in a lot of ways that amazon prime is a scam...I got it because they have shows that aren't on netflix bt I will not pay to watch them...I will just wait till they come on free on netflix..,1390435200,4,604,4.11864406779661
4482660,4,B004VJJFN4,"I just finished watching Season 1 and while I found it interesting, it didn't go deep enough into the things I liked and there were things that I had no interest in at all. I bought season 2 so I will watch it, but I don't think I'll purchase furhter seasons.",1390262400,,259,4.098039215686274
4482661,5,B004VJJFN4,"i just love this show, it cannot do no wrong! It is always interesting know more trivial facts...as well as entertaining",1386288000,,120,4.761904761904762
4482662,5,B004VJJFN4,"great series! just a head's up though, it doesn't have Don Wildman doing his usual hosting duties and looking at items like the seasons later on. but it's still great and informative! :)",1383696000,,186,4.666666666666667
4482663,5,B004VJJFN4,The best show ever! This is what reality TV should be not the junk they have out there now.  The true stories are so coll,1382140800,,121,3.84
4482664,5,B004VJJFN4,"Our nine year old son loves these!  He learns a lot, very educational and interesting.  I'm learning right along with him :-)",1382054400,,125,4.636363636363637
4482665,5,B004VJJFN4,"I had seen this on TV a few years ago and found one of the stories in this Season was about my Great Grandma and Great
Grandpa and how they died.  I wanted it to keep in the family to show my children about their great great grandparents.
It was just as I expected.",1380672000,,265,3.9074074074074074
4482666,4,B004VJJFN4,"Great series. Fun facts in history all the way through. I was expecting the narration to be done by Don Wildman like the latter seasons, but instead it's some other guy whose voice doesn't quite fit the show like Don's does. Hah. Yes. That's why I dropped 1 Star from my rating... the odd sounding narrator. Other then that, this show is a good watch for any age.",1377302400,2,363,4.352941176470588
4482667,5,B004VJJFN4,The family and I enjoyed Mysteries at the Museum we are fascinated with the awesome true stories  hours of entertainments,1376438400,,121,5.05
8443400,5,B004VJJFN4,The entire family loves this. My 9 and 14 yr old complain there should be more seasons on DVD.,1521936000,,94,4.0
8443401,1,B004VJJFN4,"Don't be fooled - this is simply another episode, before Don Wildman became involved.  While the title says haunted objects, there is nothing in this episode remotely related.  Definitely misleading!!",1502755200,,200,5.633333333333334
8443402,5,B004VJJFN4,This was an accidental purchase made with my Firestick.  But I love the series.,1493337600,,79,4.642857142857143

8443405,4,B004VJJFN4,1/2 hour episodes explaining the history of various objects found in museums around the country.  Very excellent reenactments of the original stories.  Does not require much thinking and is perfect for enjoying a quiet low-key half-hour or so.,1479513600,4,243,5.368421052631579
8443406,5,B004VJJFN4,"Love this show, which I was recently introduced.  Didn't know there were so many seasons!  I'm an amazon prime member, but they still charge for each episode!  Not fair!",1474502400,,169,4.758620689655173
8443407,3,B004VJJFN4,"Pretty interesting series-- jumps the shark from time to time, but worthy couch viewing.",1473465600,,88,5.357142857142857
8443408,5,B004VJJFN4,Shows like this are very educational as it provides an insight on items that lots of people don't know about...,1471392000,3,111,4.6
