2688947,1,B000KF0DDO,"i don't expect much out of National lampoon, but i was hoping for anything more. this movie was nearly as bad as the worst movie i have ever seen, The underground comedy movie. if you even know what that is, then you know what i'm talking about. i turned this movie off after about 45 minutes because i was bored out of my mind. i wasn't shocked, wasn't laughing, and would rather watch something on real TV.

I love jackass, wild boyz, viva la bam, and all the other things this crew has done. i also was a fan of Van Wilder which was by far the best national lampoon movie to come thusfar, so this was indeed a disappointment. i ain't watching anymore of Steve-o's side projects because he just doesn't care about the product he's selling. Just watch Steve-o: out on bail which was another example of his lack of concern for those who are paying him, the fans.",1174262400,,862,4.354037267080745
2688948,1,B000KF0DDO,"This is one of those kind of films that been done better by others.

This film wallows in humilation and excrement. If you like this sort of stuff, there's probably some form of therapy you can receive short of a lobotomy.",1173571200,3,222,4.414634146341464
2688949,2,B000KF0DDO,"Typical immature movie. Not very entertaining. Expected more from National Lampoon, they used to be very funny!",1173398400,,111,5.588235294117647
2688950,4,B000KF0DDO,"classic tripped out stoner movie, with no point, but who needs a point, we just need funny stuff, the movie occassionally goes over board with cheezey scenes, but all and all this is a must have for all you stoners. this movie is like a combination of Jackass and reno 911.",1172534400,4,273,4.372549019607843
2688951,1,B000KF0DDO,"I enjoyed the jackass movies and some of national lampoons other films so i figured this ought to be good. I was wrong. There was a lot of potential there, parodies of ""Fear Factor"" and ""Miami Vice"". The entire thing was painfully unfunny, lots of drug use and pointless violence and homosexuality. The MTV Cribs parody PADS merely showed steve-O's ""house"" littered with booze and drugs and he stumbled about half-nude and cursing. I wouldnt wish this movie on my enemies. Please don't buy, watch or be near this movie at any time.",1172448000,,531,4.720430107526882
2688952,4,B000KF0DDO,"Surprise, surprise, this low-budget comedy is unique, well crafted and funny! I wasn't expecting much, especially considering that the four main actors, Pontius, Steve-o, Wee-Man, and Preston Lacy, have no acting skills, but this film was damn creative! You won't have a chance to get bored, as the skits keep changing, and you might even find yourself wanting to re-watch it to fully understand all the humor here.",1171324800,8,415,5.117647058823529
2688953,4,B000KF0DDO,"This was really quite a surprise, and a very funny movie.  Chocked full of paradies and satire, this film spoofs many populer tv shows and reality shows on tv today. Featuring Steve-O, Wee Man and others from ""Jackass"", this at times brings on a pretty good chuckle, with a lot of physical comedy we know from from this crew.  If you like the Lampoon ""Lost Reality"" series, then you should like this also.  Rent it, even buy it, good viewing.",1170892800,4,442,4.5
2688954,4,B000KF0DDO,"I was suprised to see this coming out today, I had seen a preview for it, but forgot about it until I saw it in the ads sunday. It contains much of the cast of Jackass (steve-o, wee-man, and others), and some other familiar faces of comedy actors.  This movie is made up of skits that are parodies of current TV shows...national lampoon's style.  Overall funny, about 90 minutes of no brain laughing humor.  No acadamy award here, but it does make for a fun time anyway. Check it out, especially if you like the National Lampoon's lost reality DVD's 1 and 2.",1170720000,7,558,4.398058252427185
2688955,2,B000KF0DDO,"Just not as good as Jackass - and I think Steve-O just tries too hard. Honestly if you have to pay, skip it.",1400716800,,108,3.739130434782609
2688956,4,B000KF0DDO,"If you don't like Jackass, then you shouldn't even begin to watch this movie.

There is plenty of humor within this show if you want to escape into some stupid humor.  It is filled with short bits that contain adult comedy and stunts mixed in.  It does contain some nudity and sexual humor.

If easily offended, move along and try something else.
Otherwise, enjoy most of the bits within this movie.",1389398400,,399,4.577464788732394
2688957,5,B000KF0DDO,"This movie is horrible. But it's horrible in the kind of way that Scary Movie and Harold and Kumar are horrible. It's so bad that it's funny. And a lot of people are saying it's sad that they exploited Steve-O's drug addiction, but that's what Jackass and Wildboys did too, and he loved it. I read his memoir, and he said he encouraged it. I know it's kind of sad but I mean, he's recovering now so don't get your panties in a twist about it. Overall a funny movie, and I'm happy with my purchase.",1375401600,,497,4.1875
2688958,5,B000KF0DDO,"this movie is very funny. steve-o, wee man, chris pontius and preston lacy star in this movie.this movie is like a jackass/the comedy movie scary movie.",1341619200,,152,4.884615384615385
2688959,2,B000KF0DDO,"I saw this sitting on a shelf and I had just watched Jackass 3 and figured, what the hell, it could be good for a laugh. It has most of the cast of Jackass minus arguably the two biggest stars-Bam and Johnny. The dvd came with a cool looking tv guide based on the movie as an insert and the menu to the movie was like the tv guide channel. I'd give them 5 stars for those two things alone. Sadly, the movie has a few funny scenes but alot of it is unfunny. If you're a big Jackass fan then you might enjoy it but if your a casual fan who likes Jackass on occassion, then this movie is not for you.",1335484800,,597,3.861788617886179
2688960,1,B000KF0DDO,"I have seen bad movies in my time, but this is a top ten contender. Anyone could make a film like this. Buy a camcorder and you could. Sheer crap!!! It is like a 7th grader made a film in his spare time . There is no plot, nor is it funny. I guess this is why it is selling on Amazon now as I write this review, for a penny new which is way too much. National Lampoon used to make good films like Animal House. Now if it says National Lampoon I say avoid it like the plague. I am throwing my copy in the trash. I am ashamed anyone will see I own this. If it was a rental I would have to wear a bag with eye holes to return it.",1322265600,,626,3.6444444444444444
2688961,1,B000KF0DDO,"What is the point of releasing an unrated version of a movie that wasn't good enough to be released in the first place?  As a rabid Jackass fan I snatched this up the first time I saw it at the video store.  My wife was the sensible one and refused to watch it with me.  This isn't even remotely funny.  What could be added to this that wasn't in the original release?  More nudity?  More cursing?  More of Steve-O on a not only unfunny but truly frightening drug binge that when I first watched this I said to myself that he either needed to enter rehab or he was going to die very soon (Glad he went with rehab).  Seriously I love the Jackass guys and I try to support them in whatever they do, but this is just bad.  It is truly unwatchable.  There are two things I remember about this movie they are Chris Pontius playing Jesus (funny considering his infamous skit on Jackass) and feeling just sad and scared for Steve-O.",1260230400,,925,4.264367816091954
2688962,5,B000KF0DDO,"This is arguably one of the finest films ever made. In an instant classic making performance, Steve-O Chris Pontius, Preston Lacy and Wee-Man really stepped up and nailed this one. This is big time funny. TV The Movie is a must have for your DVD collection. I bought two copies, one to watch and one to save as an investment. I don't know who wrote ""TVTM"" but they did a really good job. Bring on ""TV The Movie 2"".",1222992000,3,414,4.253164556962025
2688963,2,B000KF0DDO,"I thought that this movie was going to be so funny and a great watch but in fact all it was a bunch of naked parts and sexual behavior.  I am a big big fan of the jackass crew and was so excited when I found this.  I was very disappointed in what it was about.  There were some funny parts that made me laugh but the whole movie is just basically a porn.  This is way way more for guys then girls that's for sure.  I also wanted to see more of Chris and he has such a small part, that made me sad.  I would say rent this movie before you buy it because you may be unhappy with what you get.  I am going to just stick with wildboyz and my jackass DVDs.",1200528000,,651,3.7426470588235294
2688964,2,B000KF0DDO,"Being a fan of Amazon Women on the Moon and Kentucky Fried Movie, when I saw this at the video store, I was inclined to rent it.  Add the fact that it stars a few members of the Jackass crew, I was relatively stoked to see what this was all about.

For anyone who isn't familiar with the first two films I listed, this movie isn't so much a movie, per se, as it is a collection of skits compiled into a movie.  The difference being while Amazon Women on the Moon featured a group of up-and-coming actors at the time (such as Arsenio Hall, David Alan Grier, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Phil Hartman to name a few), TV The Movie features mostly B-List celebrities in addition to the Jackass crew (Judd Nelson, Miguel A. Nez Jr., Jason Mewes, and Tony Cox all make appearances.)

The skits start off pretty funny, with Party Dude, The Real Fear Factor, a parody of the Jamie Kennedy show, and the first Tijuana Cops skit actually getting a laugh or two from my friends and I...

... then it kinda goes downhill from there.

After about a half hour, the acting become predictable.  You start noticing that Steve-O doesn't play too many roles except for the role of himself.  Preston Lacy doesn't play anyone whose size ISN'T an issue.  And throughout the film, there seems to be this fascination with midgets that goes beyond whatever roles might be suitable for Wee Man.  There's even a skit that advertises a fake line of Jackass figurines.  That was kinda weak.

The skits are also what ends up dragging the movie down towards the end.  Instead of creating new ideas and working on them, the second half of the film takes the skits that were played out at the first half the film and just drags them on to unnecessary lengths.  While it would have been better to write new skits or just end the movie earlier, there's probably about 30 minutes of film that just seems completely unnecessary due to its lack of imagination.

Overall, if you see this at the video store and it's not a two-day rental, or if you need to throw something in your NetFlix queue, then by all means.  If you're thinking about buying this movie however, unless you're a fanatic of either National Lampoon or the Jackass people, I'd find a better way to invest the money.",1184716800,,2238,4.475369458128079

8156149,1,B000KF0DDO,Ever think up a really funny skit and want to make a video? These guys haven't. I watched most of the movie holding out for that ONE funny skit.. I didn't get my reward. I suggest watching only the last third of this move because I already watched the first two thirds and there's no reason for 2 of us to suffer. Maybe you'll get luck and there will be a funny skit at the end.,1407628800,7,378,3.986842105263158
