7903181,3,B000003OHL,"I loved the first tape. I got it used from my local library for about 50 cents. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was how fast they went during the one song. Then I saw two and three. I don't recommend two at all. The first showed you the word on screen and was repeated twice. The only thing shown on screen during the second one is the alphabet block. I have no idea what I'm saying and I'm the kind of person who needs to see the word she's saying. The third is like the first, and shows the words. The only problem is the animation is seriously dated. The third one is almost all live action and it features two cute kids and their friends and family. Moustache the cat goes with them, and he looks like a cardboard cutout in the real world. I mean, I know they didn't have the adventure's of rocky and Bullwinkle's budget or who framed roger rabbits, but still, they could have tried a little harder. All in all, I am a collector and bought them to have them all, but I would only recommend the first.",1473724800,,1010,4.106060606060606
7903182,3,B000003OHL,"My daughter is starting French Immersion School in the Fall, so we wanted to get a variety of media to help our family learn a little French this summer.  Bonjour Les Amis is a good video for this purpose.  It is not the  most cutting edge in animation, but is interesting enough to hold all of  our attention and give us a foundation in French.  We have not been able to  find many other kid-oriented french language tutorial-focussed videos.
We  have been able to listen to the articulation of words and simulate them.  The repetition is done in a way to help solidify words in our memory  without becoming boring.  I would recommend this video to others looking  for some introduction to French.",964742400,12,698,4.59349593495935
