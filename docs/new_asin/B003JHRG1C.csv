4129632,4,B003JHRG1C,had a decent storyline but was a little out in left field.  the wife certainly had issues.,1414627200,2,90,4.294117647058823
4129633,5,B003JHRG1C,"Minimalist.

This art movie employs the artistic philosophy of minimalism to new heights. Three main characters: Maite, Jean, and Vincent, and one often used setting: the prison where Vincent is hold up in for seven years.

Maite, played convincingly by Valerie Donzelli, is the dutiful wife, of prison inmate Vincent, Bruno Todeschini, and visits him regularly. She, however, catches the eye of prison guard, Jean, Cyril Troley, who chases after her to start a sexual liaison while her husband rots in prison.

The storyline is okay. Yet what makes this movie remarkable is how little is put into it. The movie is sparse. It looks and feels empty but it is overflowing with emotions and tensions. The director Jean-Pascal Hattu, paces and unfolds this story in a timely, artistic bend, it reflects minimalism to its true core: less is more.",1414195200,11,841,4.992857142857143

4129639,3,B003JHRG1C,In line with the french tradition this movie is kind of boring. The female character is well developed but it is slow and as so many European films it has no real ending. The woman has a nice body that makes the film somehow worth watching.,1468540800,,240,4.239130434782608

4129652,4,B003JHRG1C,"Slow moving, not much of a plot, very French, depressing. But enough going on that I enjoyed watching it. Really no explicit sex scenes or nudity. Most of the time the wife is walking around bundled up in her heavy clothing, but she smolders with frustrated sexuality. The guard is kind of a dork and is overwhelmed by her. The husband is unpredictable, hard to know what's going on in his head. Certainly not a movie for everyone, but worth watching if you like foreign films.",1459468800,6,477,4.558139534883721

4129686,4,B003JHRG1C,"A very interesting movie that raises a number of questions in the viewers mind.  The blurbs for film make it sound like an exploitation movie and it does include a few, less than graphic scenes, but it is much more than that.  There are 3 principal characters and the viewers sympathies change as the film progresses.  I first started watching the film because it is French and I like to keep up on French culture since I lived there for 13 years.  This is a good example of the French fatalistic outlook on life and fascination with somewhat marginal and unhappy characters.",1426377600,,575,4.607843137254902

4129720,3,B003JHRG1C,"Generally I don't care for movies set in a prison, but I thought I'd try this one. Mait's husband is incarcerated for 7 years but we don't know why.  She lives at their home and babysits for a young boy across the street whose mother works long hours. She dutifully washes and irons her husband's clothes and  goes to visit him weekly where he complains and she professes her love for him.  One day, as she is leaving the prison, a stranger approaches her and offers her a ride.  She rebuffs this man, although she is lonely and he is good-looking, in a French, gaunt way. Her female friend asks Mait if she ever gets lonely and suggests she take a lover. The kernel is planted and now Mait decides to hook up with the stranger, Jean, whom we find out is a warden at the prison. It turns out that Vincent, Mait's husband, has set up this infidelity and wants Jean to tape these infidelities to help him pass the time in prison.  Like many French movies, we are absorbed into the story for a short period of time, then the movie abruptly ends with no resolution. Mait has some issues of her own, as does the young boy for whom she babysits (he wants to ""marry her"" and live with her, and he is always stealing and lighting matches.) French movies of this genre are big on setting but small on plot, so I found the ending to be somewhat unsettling and abrupt.",1415491200,5,1357,4.305882352941176
