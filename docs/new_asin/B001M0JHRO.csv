I was also surprised how one of my favorite songs, The Thing That Should Not Be, was performed so awfully. The way Hetfield sung it, ruined it. Why mess with a classic? Maybe, they wanted to highlight the new songs by making an old one sound crappy?",1286064000,,331,4.442622950819672
8320217,3,B001M0JHRO,"Casual Metallica fans will find nothing of interest here. That said, I'm a little disappointed as well. Why the video for All Nightmare Long was not included, I don't know. What is included is an audio track of All Nightmare Long that can be played on your TV. Again, this type of thing is pretty worthless, so I don't know why it was included.

What is interesting is the ""documentary."" I use the quotations because it isn't really a documentary. It's ten minutes of interviews followed by Metallica's performance of the first three songs of their Berlin set. They open with That Was Just Your Life and End of the Line (the first two tracks on Death Magnetic) and follow up with The Thing That Should Not Be. Also included is rehearsal footage of the band before the show, which is interesting but tedious.

My biggest qualm with this DVD, though, is the lack of 5.1 surround sound. Metallica, commercial giant that it is, decides to release a DVD without surround sound? COME ON! They should be embarassed!

Discluding the audio track, the material on this DVD clocks in at about 45 minutes, half of which is live footage. It's not the kind of thing most people would watch multiple times, and the sound quality is lacking. My recommendation: don't spend more than five dollars on this.",1240617600,,1288,4.665198237885463
8320218,3,B001M0JHRO,"The video, as stated in the product description as of 4-19-09, is not on this DVD. It is just an audio version that can be played on your TV. Big whoop. The other two features, the three songs from the CD release party and a little demo in a semi trailer, how do they get so many camera angles in that small of a space?, are for the diehard fans only. Fans in passing may only play this once and feel ripped off. For the diehards, it offers an interesting glimpse into the band, a couple of quotes and interviews sprinkled with the performances. The semi trailer rehearsal is kinda cool but I can't help wondering why. To be honest, the live performance at the CD release party is kinda bland and is better suited if you have the downloaded version of it, whether you paid for it or got it for free by purchasing the Death Magnetic box set, like I did. Worth the effort, but would have been even better if the video was included as stated in the product description. This is a good purchase but only if you are really into the band and already have a few things by the band besides the stock releases. Cheers.",1240099200,,1109,4.260663507109005
8320219,4,B001M0JHRO,"There's a lack of information regarding what this single actually is, and the information that is out there isn't accurate.  First of all, unlike the title specifies, this is NOT a DVD-Audio.  It is a DVD Video, with no special high quality DVD-Audio sound, and no 5.1 surround either.  Also, this does NOT contain the ""All Nightmare Long"" video.

Now, onto what it does have.

Three items appear when you insert the DVD (which by the way, is NTSC and Region 0).
-  The ""All Nightmare Long"" single, just audio, can be played over a still photo of the single artwork (again, no music video).
-  A 32 minute documentary of Metallica's release party performance in Berlin on 9/12/08, which includes full performances of ""That Was Just Your Life"", ""The End of the Line"", and ""The Thing That Should Not Be"".  This was the first time that Metallica had performed the first two songs live.
-  A 15 minute rehearsal from a 2008 summer festival prior to the show.  Metallica are jamming on a few issues they need to work on, just moments before going on stage.  It's interesting to see how this works and to watch them get on each other for forgetting how to play certain songs.  In this little set, they jam on pieces of ""Stone Cold Crazy"", ""Motorbreath"" and ""Creeping Death"".

Oh, and the DVD is anamorphic widescreen.  I ordered it in mid-February 2009 from Amazon and they shipped it to me in just a couple of days.  Hope that clears things up!",1235001600,6,1439,4.544747081712062
