8041644,3,B0006IINL4,"I saw all the 5 star reviews, and thought this would be an excellent choice to show in my Intro to Policing class.  One review mentioned the high quality of the video.  I don't agree.  It is okay, but not what it was made out to be.  Wondering if some of the other reviewers had something to do with the production or sale of the video.  Don't get me wrong, it is interesting, just not very high quality.",1383091200,,404,4.128205128205129
8041645,5,B0006IINL4,"Lots of detail, excellent quality, and a good overview of the LAPD.  That department has been maligned, vilified, and demonized in the media, but also glorified on TV.  This is a thoughtful and worthwhile addition to my DVD library.",1373760000,,232,4.923076923076923

With 6 hours of viewing for $15.00, I expected an amateur production.

8041649,5,B0006IINL4,I started watching this 6 hour video and I couldn't stop watching it until I was done.  It is one the best videos I have ever watch for a documtentary of this type.
