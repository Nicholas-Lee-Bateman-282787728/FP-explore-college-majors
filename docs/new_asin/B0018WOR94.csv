3421450,1,B0018WOR94,this copy of the video 5 fingers was the wordt piece of garbage I could almost not see. It was terrible in every way.

3421451,5,B0018WOR94,"This review is about the imported all-region DVD from Korea. There seems to be general agreement among reviewers here about the movie itself -- it's great fun, and not far short of being a great movie -- but a strong difference of opinion about the DVD. My own experience was good. I received the DVD today (Feb. 20, 2012), and here is what I found:

For image quality, it's somewhat better than the other copy I've seen, a rental VHS tape. Like that copy, it's slightly dark overall in the sense that shadows are deep, not that it's muddy-looking. Mid-tones show up well, nothing is washed out, and closeup shots show good detail. Lines are clean, not jagged. I wouldn't call it a breathtakingly sharp image, but sharp. Without knowing how much better the best prints of this movie are, I don't feel anything lacking. The sound is satisfactory, too. As other reviewers have noted, it's easy to turn off the Korean subtitles. I can also confirm that it is an all-region DVD; at least, it plays on my Region 2 equipment.

Five Fingers itself is a favorite of mine. The wartime espionage story is engrossing, the dialogue and acting are of the kind they don't make anymore, and the direction is pleasingly transparent -- effective without being showy. The five-star review is for the movie, but I'm also entirely satisfied with the DVD.",1329696000,,1334,4.696581196581197

3421454,5,B0018WOR94,"If you've a WWII buff and never seen this movie starring the great & underappreciated James Mason, you really should check it out. James Mason stars as 'valet, servant' turned opportunistic spy. This film is reminiscent of another great WWII spy film ""The Man Who Never Was"" with Clifton Webb. And like that film, the 'action'  in 5 Fingers is rather slow by todays standards but the dialogue between characters and the way they move about the screen in glorious black & white, is something you don't see in films anymore. This movie has a simple plot but a couple of wonderful 'twist's I won't reveal here, that you just don't see coming. The ending with James Mason now elevated from 'servant' to 'Master' will leave you speechless and remind you that as they say 'they don't make movies like this anymore'",1269388800,2,808,4.690140845070423

There is a bit of fiction thrown in, but it only adds to the story to make it more entertaining.  The story except for that bit is a true one.

3421470,5,B0018WOR94,"There is not only ""no accounting for taste"", there is also obviously no accounting for a change in taste. Up until a few months ago, I had never liked, and certainly not loved this movie, finding it emotionally to cold and remote. I'm not sure what has changed my mind, and there is no question that it's now amongst my favorite spy dramas. Of course, the pacing of the movie, and the absolute icy reserve of all the leading characters requires a very different, patient appreciation of the story. It is, even more than ""The Day of the Jackal"", another of my all-time favorites, the epitome of a type of movie that has almost completely disappeared from todays' foolish, formulaic mix of gratuitous violence and over-active camera-work.

It's well to remember, however, that this is NOT the true story, which is far more complex, and still not completely resolved to this day, as to whether ""Cicero"" was in all, or in part, a British double agent. Yet, it feels so real, and thus is a true compliment to everyone involved in its' production.

As a side note, all of the actors, especially the great James Mason, Danielle Darrieux, Michael Rennie and the wonderful John Wengraf (an interesting story) as Von Papen make this memorable so special kudos to the casting director as well as to Joseph Mankiewicz the director.",1436572800,,1319,4.755458515283843

3421488,5,B0018WOR94,"James Mason is absolutely in his element in this espionage counter- espionage true story. He is so perfect as the villain he even makes handsome good guy Michael Rennie seem somewhat dull. There was so much double-crossing in this film I got confused as to who were the villains. However even the bona fide Nazis in the film are likeable. John Wegraf as von Papen the Nazi ambassador is an attractive character, played to the hilt.

Of course masquerading butler to the British ambassador James Mason, who blithely steals secret memos and documents from the British embassy and sells them to the Nazis, is a rogue but how can you resist him? In the German embassy he stares at a picture of Hitler  then walks by and stares at a a bust of Hitler. No expression at all. But you are thinking ""This guy is not a Nazi!""  In two scenes he meticulously puts on a  pair of white leather gloves. Somehow I think this is an allusion to the  five fingers of the title. The ilustration for the movie shows a hand with a  sin written on each finger- lust, greed, passion, desire and sin

Danielle Darrieux is wonderful as the greedy Countess Anna Staviska who is given a great deal of money by James Mason, money gleaned from his spy operations. The Countess is beautiful and charismatic but wily. She probably admires nobody except herself.  She's fearless if indiscrete. She makes a crack about Hermann Goering's recent wild pig chase as ""brother against brother"".James Mason has, of course, fallen for Anna, his one indiscretion, his one mistake.

The film is shot on location in Ankara, Turkey and Rio de Janeiro, adding authenticity and wonderful ambiance. This highly literate movie has a humdinger of an ending which appears just right. Highly recommended!",1413763200,3,1750,4.749174917491749

Now that this little-known film gem is available in a US format, don't miss it. It is a masterpiece of intrigue with a witty script which has the ring of truth because it is based on a true story. Mason is perfect as the cynical and sophisticated valet to the British ambassador in WWII Turkey who steals British secrets to sell to the Nazis. Danielle Darrieux, one of France's greatest film actresses, is very believable as a glamorous but down-on-her-luck countess in exile who becomes Mason's partner and love interest. Their double-edged relationship supplies the final ironic twist which makes the surprise ending of this film truly unforgettable. No, I won't spoil it for you.

3421496,5,B0018WOR94,"Exciting espionage story set  during the seond World War that is well-written and well-directed with an excellent international cast. James Mason plays the part of a career valet to upper-class Europeans who dominate the diplomatic corps. While working for the English ambassador to neutral Turkey, he decides to sell military secrets to the Germans so that he can finally live the life of a landed gentlemen, instead of just serving them. He finds an accomplice in a disenfranchised Polish countess ( Danielle Darrieux) whose has lost everything in the war in the way of land and money, but none of her beauty or charm.
These two clever and conniving emblems of old European greed and decadence outsmart everybody (almost) with their plan to score big and flee to Buenos Aries. James Mason's character is finally detected at the end by the British and the chase is on.

3421498,5,B0018WOR94,"This may be James Mason's best starring role and may be my favorite spy movie--a character study that, without any violence or gore, turns very suspenseful.

A note about an earlier review that credited Joseph Mankiewicz as the writer. Mankiewicz (another personal favorite--see ""All About Eve"", ""The Barefoot Contessa"", ""Sleuth"") is actually  the director of this film. The writer is Michael Wilson who adapted it from a book by the  attach&eacute; at the German embassy in Turkey--the L.C. Moyzsich who interacts with the spy who is code named ""Cicero"" by the Germans.

Mason plays the spy--suave and elegant--too smart and too sophisticated for the life he was born into (a poor Albanian , in real life, named Elyzsa Basna -- here, called ""Ulysses Diehlo"". He has worked himself up to be ""the greatest gentlemen's gentleman"" but, with money, he can be a ""gentleman"" himself).

Diehlo lives at the British embassy in Ankara as a valet for the ambassador. Calm and intelligent, he comes up with a money-making idea--to photograph top secret Allied documents sent to the ambassador and sell them at the German embassy. To this ends, he enlists a widowed Polish countess whose husband he used to work for. She (the beautiful Danielle Darrieux--also excellent in her part as she keeps us guessing about her loyalties and allegiances--and her emotional involvement with the handsome Diehlo) accepts Diehlo's plan--and sets up an estate where she entertains lavishly using some of the money Diehlo gives her from his sale to the Germans. At the countess's home, he is able to negotiate with the Germans away from the scrutiny of either embassy.

I appreciated how Wilson and Mankiewicz built suspense and how easy it became to (almost) root for the bad guys--even the Nazis in supporting parts were well acted. The elderly British ambassador brought home the fact that officials in countries outside of Europe could have changed the outcome of the war regardless of what was happening in Europe.

Intriguing characters and story--although personally I would skip the minute of introduction to the true story at the beginning (perhaps a bit of a spoiler) and just skip to the beginning of the film.

In addition to everything else to like about it, Mason is in almost every scene in a great part that really shows his range as an actor. Next on my list: his portrayal of Rommel.",1403136000,,2373,4.959697732997481

3421500,5,B0018WOR94,"""5 Fingers"" should be better known than it is. Its golden touch was applied by Joseph Mankiewicz, who knew how to write literate, witty scripts, produce movies, assemble the right kind of talent (such as Bernard Herrmann for music), and direct the right actors for their parts: here, James Mason, Danielle Darrieux, and Michael Rennie in the leads. Even the supporting cast, essential for this movie, are perfect. The story is based on the nearly incredible fact that the Nazi high command outfoxed itself by refusing to act on vital, leaked Allied battle plans because it believed they were bogus. To that twist, Mankiewicz adds a few more of his own creation.

While you're at it, check out the life and work of the real Marcus Tullius Cicero, the famed Greek scholar, lawyer and Roman republican politician.  .",1515283200,,630,4.779816513761468

8271310,5,B0018WOR94,"This film is a great retelling of the valet to the British ambassador to Turkey during ww2. James Mason plays this valet. Nobody can sell a gentleman's gentleman better than Mr. Mason.
In this true tale the valet has gained access to British documents which he sells to the Germans. It is obvious that he is not a spy for the Germans out of conviction to their cause but for their willingness to pay large sums of money for these crucial war documents. He is a man that sees this war as a chance to profit financially. He is a thief, period. But what a thief.  He is trusted by his employer, the British ambassador as if he was a member of the family. He is so good at his job that if I saw him with his hand in the safe I would think he was just dusting off the papers as a courtesy to his lordship. As this film is based on fact the real valet was I believe from some eastern european country. But Mason with his spectacular english speech can't help but sell himself as anything but a very british subject. A traitor. And he was a traitor to his employer. He is indifferent to either side but takes advantage of his situation. He is very clever . He knows when important information is in the safe and skillfully removes it and negotiates it sale to the Germans. Will he get caught is a theme which runs through the entire film. Is he really so clever that he can evade suspicion?  You do wonder that if he gets caught in the end what will a James Mason say to his capturers with his wit and charm that is his trademark. This is truly an entertaining film in content and the performances.",1488672000,,1591,4.213114754098361
