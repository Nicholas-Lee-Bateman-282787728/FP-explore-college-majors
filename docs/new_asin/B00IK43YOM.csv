6267046,5,B00IK43YOM,"Where to begin.  This box set, which includes every single episode and series broadcast on TV, is a very nice collection.  The box, cases and CDs are very high quality and well finished, something which is lacking in many complete series box sets for other titles/box sets.  The box set also includes two bonus discs about the making of the series and about the star of the show; David Suchet.  The picture and sound quality seem to me to be very good quality and play flawlessly.

Regarding the Poirot series itself, anyone considering buying this has probably seen some of them on TV or on Netflix and are likely very impressed with the quality of the acting, the clever writing, and the fidelity to the time period in which it is set.  On Netflix there are currently only 6 of the 13 series available and so it is well worth buying this collection to watch and own all 13.  The earlier series are shorter, episodic style mysteries which last about 60 minutes each.  From about series 4 onwards, the format changes to a 90-100 minute episodes which are more complex and engaging than the 60 minute episodes.  Regardless of the format, every episode and series is intelligently presented and well performed by the cast.  David Suchet is regarded by most to be the very best of the actors who have portrayed Poirot over the years and his performance is top quality in every episode.  The recurring characters; Captain Hastings, Chief Inspector Japp and Miss Lemon, also add an entertaining and familiar feel to the series, as they aid Poirot in his investigations.

I would highly recommend this item if you like the Poirot series, it is worth the money for such a well made classic.",1415577600,208,1683,4.667796610169492
6267047,4,B00IK43YOM,"We were not sure what to expect as this was another Acorn effort. Original DVD releases by Acorn for Poirot were mostly terrible when it came the the original televised episodes with excessive fuzziness, off colors, etc. Shockingly, the original British television episode we watched last night was a bloody spectacular treat. Very sharp, detailed and color corrected, using the better black level than I imagined possible. This was the first episode on the first disk and if this is an example of the rest of the collection then terrific. I spent a lot of time watching the costumes, sets, etc. because it was all eye candy.",1415404800,94,625,4.850467289719626
6267048,5,B00IK43YOM,"It is rarely argued that David Suchet is both refreshing and iconic as Agatha Christie's Poirot. In my opinion David Suchet's performance is like seeing Hurcule Poirot walk off the pages of the wonderful books by Agatha Christie and onto my Television Set. However, I wish to focus on this BEAUTIFUL collection rather than on Suchet's wonderful portrayal of Poirot.

  Amazon hasn't posted much about this collection and I bought it on faith that it would be well worth the money. Since there is still little said about the collection, I thought I would give people a head's up as to what they will be getting.

  This collection arrived in a Beautiful box measuring 4 and 1/4 inches deep 5 and 3/4 inches wide and 7 and 1/2 inches tall with a flip top lid and a front that folds open revealing four rather bulky blu-ray jewel cases. In side these four jewel cases the 28 disks are found; each labeled with the series number and disk number of that series. Jewel case one includes series 1-3 comprised of seven disks, case two has series 4-6 in it and is comprised of six disks, case three has series 7-11 in it and is comprised of eight disks, and the last case contains series 12-13 and the special features which is comprised of 7 disks; 28 disks in all.

  Each series has different specs and are as follows:
  series 1 & 2 both have an aspect ratio of 4:3 and have 2.0 Dolby Digital Sound
  series 3 has and aspect ratio of 4:3 and has 2.0 PCM Sound
  series 4 has and aspect ratio of 4:3 and has 2.0 Dolby Digital Sound
  series 5 and 6 both have an aspect ratio of 4:3 and have 2.0 PCM Sound
  series 7 and 8 both have an aspect ratio of 4:3 and have DTS HD 2.0 Sound
  series 9 - 13 all have an aspect ratio of 16:9 and have DTS HD 2.0 Sound

Picture and sound, in my opinion, are wonderful. I will enjoy this series for years to come and I hope this information helps you in your decision about whether to buy this item or not.

Update - this review is for the Blu-Ray set which has 28 discs and if I am not mistaken the DVD set has 33.",1415318400,626,2045,4.187179487179487
6267049,5,B00IK43YOM,"This collection provides a complete collection of all of the David Suchet Poirot's from 1989-2014, including all of the special videos about the series: Being Poirot (62 minutes), an 18 minute interview with Suchet, a 33 minute interview with Mathew Prichard (Christie's grandson), Super Sleuths (47 minutes, a documentary on the series), David Suchet on the Orient Express (47 minutes), and a behind-the-scenes featurette (46 minutes), and another interview with David Suchet (19 minutes).  It also includes a collector's guide with articles by David Suchet and Mathew Prichard, episode synopses, character profiles, information about Poirot and Poirot's obituary in the New York Times.

6267052,5,B00IK43YOM,"The many fine representations on the screen by David Suchet included herein can be summed up, I think, by these words from ""Funerals are Fatal.""  At one point in that story Poirot mentions something that someone said, but shouldn't have said.

""That was stupid of her, wasn't it?"" asked Rosamond Shane, a niece to one of the deceased characters herein.

Poirot shook a forefinger at her. ""It shows you, Madame, the dangers of conversation. It is a profound belief of mine that if you can induce a person to talk to you for long enough, on any subject whatever, sooner or later they will give themselves away.""

And in Funerals are Fatal it was something one person said which could not possibly be true and once you realize that, that this person is the murderer, the explanation of the crime falls rather easily into place. Of course, if you miss such crucial lines then you will find yourself in big trouble as to who did what to whom. Of course Poirot, unlike people such as myself sometimes, never misses anything...and that's why he is such an exquisite character and David Suchet deserves much esteem for accentuating the remarkable story-crafting talents of Dame Agatha Christie; a consummate writer whose mysteries are usually solvable, but only if one isn't fooled by Christie into looking in the wrong direction, something which she is an expert at encouraging. Too bad, moreover, we won't have any more stories of Agatha Christie nor any more dramatizations as found in this collection featuring David Suchet.

PS: Besides all the films that David Suchet made we have a few bonuses here, too: a behind-the-scenes featurette (46 min.) and a short interview (19 min.) with David Suchet, himself. And, by way of an extra suggestion, I would recommend reading 'An Autobiography' by Agatha Christie and Suchet's own memoir 'Poirot & Me.'",1407628800,93,1843,4.894230769230769

6267063,2,B00IK43YOM,"David Suchet's illustrious tenure as Agatha Christie's Hercules Poirot is given its full breadth, though not the full treatment on Blu-ray. A change of leadership and distribution mid-way through this set results in inconsistently rendered 1080p quality. All of the mysteries in this set have merit and are expertly played. But we really do need a thorough remastering of series 9-12. What's the point of a hi-def release if some of these discs play like badly formatted VHS copies. Too much chroma bleeding and softness to recommend this set as a whole. And Suchet's work deserves sooooooo much better!",1524614400,2,603,5.101010101010101

6267065,4,B00IK43YOM,I like that the product is as described online. I chose one of the less expensive sets available on Amazon and was concerned that the DVDs wouldn't play or that they would be some sort of knock offs. The DVD set came seemingly new as the box set looked to be professionally shrink wrapped and there appeared to be no signs of tampering. I have started with Series1 and the DVD is playing well. The reason for four stars has to do with the Series 1-3 DVD holder has the covering that is not attached. See the images for more information.,1523577600,,536,4.316831683168317

6267068,5,B00IK43YOM,"This is a great price; I paid 3 times this amount and still felt good about the purchase.  I am now a raving fan girl of David Suchet; he is a character actor without peer.  I am very familiar with the Poirot books, and the writers do take some liberties with plots and characters, but I am so in love with the magnificent attention to period detail, and with Suchet's superb acting, that I can't get too mad about it.  Watching the episodes feels like visiting old friends, and there are some lovely extras such as interviews with Suchet, a special in which Suchet travels on the restored Orient Express, interviews with guest stars, etc.  Hugh Fraser is a sweet and likable Hastings, and Philip Jackson makes Chief Inspector Japp much more sympathetic, and less clownish, than he appears in the books.  In fact, all of the characters, Poirot included, seem more real and likable than Dame Agatha made them (she really didn't like the character of Poirot very much, but the public loved him too much for her to stop writing about him).  The secondary characters, Miss Lemon included, have more of a role in the series than they had in the books, which adds some continuity to the series and, as I mentioned above, makes it feel like visiting old friends every time I watch an episode.  I cannot recommend this series too highly.  The sets, the locations, the wardrobe - all are spot-on and period appropriate.  When I finish I am going to watch them all again from the beginning.  Buy them, watch them, love them.  [I was not paid for this review - I shelled out quite a lot of cash for this collection.  Worth every penny.]",1522627200,,1625,4.546391752577319

6267090,4,B00IK43YOM,"UPDATE, February 15, 2018: The new set ordered directly from Amazon arrived. I don't think anything in the fourth case will be playable, they're so badly scratched. All of the disks in the first case load and play, and there was no dirt in the cases, so that's something I guess. I'm very disappointed to have received 2 bad versions of this product. Will see if I can cobble together one good set from the two; if not, the second one will be returned. Again.

UPDATE: This set was sold by MaxZar. We watched disk 2 from the 2nd plastic case, and there were two places where the glitches were so bad we had to fast forward past them. And of course, missed some vital clues. So I looked at the rest of the disks in the case. Of the 9 disks, 6 are scratched, some worse than #2. In the other two cases, every single disk was scratched or pitted, and there were particles of dirt in the cases and fingerprints showing that the disks had been at least taken out and put back in by someone other than myself! I was completely disgusted, and even though it was well beyond the return deadline, I sent a request anyway. Lo and behold, MaxZar is refunding my purchase price IN FULL, less sales tax! And I don't have to return the disks.

But I still want to see the shows, and not on my tiny laptop screen, so I'm going to buy another set from a different seller and see if my experience is any better.

My husband bought this box set for me as a Christmas present, as I've become a big fan of Hercule Poirot. Very attractive packaging. There are four plastic cases in the box. Of the 9 discs in the first case, disks 1, 8, and 9 are faulty. They are not scratched, but my DVD player refuses to play them. ""Loading disk"" hangs until finally I get the ""Cannot Play Disk"" message. Disks 2-7 worked fine, and I very much enjoyed the programs.  The first disk in the second case loaded, but there were some screen glitches at first and the sound was scratchy. Oddly enough, it loaded once, showed the screen with the title, but I was not able to select anything. The theme music played through once. Then the screen went dark, and it started all over again, this time with an active screen where I could select the episode.",1518134400,4,2211,4.294964028776978

6267101,5,B00IK43YOM,"""The little grey cells are thinking!"" as Poirot would say!
If you never seen or heard of Agatha Christie's Poirot, you definitely missed out on one of the most classical detectives of all time, who I would even rank above Sherlock Holmes. With David Suchet playing a remarkable Poirot, they play through the series steadily in this collection--the series starting and ending as it originally aired on the BBC broadcast. There's also Hastings and several of the regular characters, and for the most part they stay true to the books. (A must for me!)
The box that it comes shipped in is pretty unique, the top part with the 'hat' folding up so the front flap falls forward. All the one sided DVDs are inside then.
I actually had to return and reorder it the first time I ordered it, as half of the DVD cases inside the box were damaged--seemingly from shipping. The second time it worked out though, and I'm happy for the buy!

6267113,1,B00IK43YOM,"Of course the Suchet performances are 10-star, par-excellence, will never be repeated to this level; but I wish to rate this one-star only because of the mix in sound.  This set has so many various sound outputs; i.e. PCM, Dolby and DTS.  Why not  make all discs in all three audio formats and allow the user the option to choose which one to use.  In my particular case, my audio output is a Bose Solo and anything Bose (almost anything) will not support DTS or Dolby Atmos or TrueHD only Dolby 5.1.  When there is no option as the later discs in this set which are many as are the latest output of another long running English murder mystery series running beginning in 1997 and since switching to Blu-Ray in the past few years, I have to switch over to my horrible internal TV speakers.  Bose simply will not support high-end Dolby or more frustratingly DTS of any type.  So, Acorn, how much trouble would it have been, as do most movies, have a setup option, and allow us to decide which audio format we would like to hear it under?  Thankfully, another reviewer went to the trouble to detail which discs had which type of audio for which I am eternally grateful.

Lately, most of the popular streaming services have ceased the broadcast of all of the seasons, which hampers a good binge watching session.  I saw that the complete series was for sale here and I picked it up.  The outer box is adorned with gold and black, made very well for archiving.  After opening the box, I discovered multiple plastic cases, containing the sets of DVDs.  Upon opening the cases, I discovered that, while Acorn and A&E came up with a clever ""booK"" design, it wasn't as resilient as I had hoped.  The inserts in the cases were all virtually broken, but fortunately, the discs were still attached to each plastic leaf.  I had to drop one star for the broken cases, but all of the DVDs are ok.  I heard some folks having issues getting their discs to play and I observed that they do take longer than usual to load in my Sony DVD player, but they do load and play just fine.",1506816000,3,999,4.391304347826087

6267186,5,B00IK43YOM,"This is one of my favorite box sets and I enjoy watching it again and again since I bought it when it came out late 2014. First of all, the quality of the mysteries are absolutely top notch and they are nicely dramatized for the tv and perfectly acted by all cast, but especially David Suchet's portrayal of Belgium detective Hercule Poirot is simply divine. It is really worth the price (especially if you consider that this product was $400 when it was first released).

As great and superb as these episodes, I have a few criticism about the technical aspect of the product. You will see that the format of the series change as it moves to series 7-11 (the third bundle in the box set). The bars that show up on the left and right side are gone and the picture is full-screen. I assume this is due to the way they shot the show; they must have changed the aspect ratio, the film or some other technicalities regarding the filming of the show. All of these are fine however I do notice a considerable change in the clarity of the picture. The picture quality is somehow not quite the same as the episodes in the previous series. When I load the discs (again I am talking series 7-11), my bluray player shows ""BD_ROM"" and seems not to recognize the format because it does not automatically play the disc. In few instances, I noticed that it even skips the ads that play in the beginning (not a big loss there but still indicative of encoding problems). This encoding issue also causes the subtitles setting to drop off between episodes. For instance, in Series 1 thru 7, I just put the subtitles on and they stay on as it plays one episode after the other. But in series 7-11, you have to put the subtitle on with each new episodes. These are not major problems which is why I gave this product 5 star because the content of the series is still superb. I wish Acorn did a better job handling the format change of the series, and I wish they had been able to keep the quality of the picture all throughout the series consistently. This product definitely deserves it and more.",1488844800,,2076,4.40625

6267209,4,B00IK43YOM,"I love Agatha Christie mysteries, so this set was a ""god-send"" for me. My only real disappointment was ""Murder On The Orient Express"". This movie was so VERY melodramatic it was pathetic. I would never believe I would say this but David Suchet should never have agreed to make this movie. I greatly enjoyed the remake, however, with Albert Finney as Poirot that also starred Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Anthony Perkins & Vanessa Redgrave to name a few, was much better at telling the back story of baby Daisy Armstrong and was much more fluent leading up to the solution and explanation of the crime and ""who did it"". So if you get the chance watch this one and you will see a HUGE difference between the two in the acting, directing and over quality of work. I also feel that the remakes of ""Evil Under The Sun"" and ""Death On The Nile"" w/ Peter Ustinov as Poirot were much better then the originals w/ David Suchet. Enough said.",1482192000,3,946,4.538011695906433
6267210,4,B00IK43YOM,"With this collection, you will get hours and hours of fun entertainment. David Suchet is perfect for the role of Poirot. The early episodes are shorter, 50 minute or so mysteries and they evolve into the 90-minute movie format for the later seasons. There are definitely some strong hits and a few misses. (I really disliked ""Murder on the Orient Express"", for example). I didn't like Poirot's change in character in the last few episodes and Curtains was just plain shocking to me (although, I understand that this is how Christie wrote Poirot's ending). The picture quality for these Blu-rays are not exactly consistent, but the entertainment value overshadows this. If you're a Christie fan, this set is a must-have for your collection.",1480032000,5,739,5.016260162601626

6267214,5,B00IK43YOM,"This collection contains the complete 70 episodes spread across 13 series of ""Agatha Christies Poirot."" Additionally, it includes the documentaries David Suchet on the Orient Express, Being Poirot, Super Sleuths: Poirot, and an additional interview with star David Suchet. This adaption of Agatha Christies famous Belgian detective stands as the definitive version, not only for the quality of the filmmaking, but also because the producers are the only ones to adapt the complete series of Poirot stories.
Any show composed of 13 series that aired over the course of 24 years is bound to change over time and thats no different here. The first five series are the most enjoyable, especially with the regular cast of Suchet as Poirot, Hugh Fraser as Captain Hastings, Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector Japp, and Pauline Moran as Miss Lemon. After these five, the show permanently changes over from 50 minute episodes to 100 minute films and, with the exception of Zo Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver in six episodes, the only recurring character is Suchet as Poirot himself. In tone, these solo adventures are markedly darker than the earlier series and, at times, carry heavily religious messages. While the chronology of the show was gradually approaching World War II, this tonal shift can be a little off-putting in these later series. This shift may have been less obvious to those who watched the series as it aired, but a box set such as this allows for marathon viewing and the changes becomes more obvious. That said, the later series maintain the same high quality as their predecessors.
For fans of the Poirot stories or the show, this collection is a must-have. The box set looks lovely on any shelf, with an understated design that evokes the art deco of the stories settings. The 33 discs are contained in 4 hard plastic cases designed to accommodate the discs.",1477180800,11,1870,4.977635782747604

6267233,5,B00IK43YOM,"I grow up watching Peter Ustinov as Poirot, but I have to say David Suchet has won me over with this series. The writers and producers have taken a great deal of pain to stay as close to the original stories as possible (although some of the stories do deviate a bit). I also read somewhere that Suchet vowed to complete all the Poirot original stories before reaching his 65th birthday. These are all the stories and god bless him for sticking with it (although I beleive he went just a bit beyond 65 to finish it). This collection also includes a special called ""Being Poirot"" which has interveiws with Suchet and Mathew Prichard (Agatha Christie's grandson). This special is a delightful addition to the collection.

Although the other Bonus Feature 'Super Sleuths' can be considered your run of the mill extra, it is still an entertaining and at times surprising piece nonetheless.",1438646400,2,548,4.65979381443299
6267286,5,B00IK43YOM,"This is one of the best packaged set I have ever owned. The box is sturdy and provides easy access to the four sets of disks inside. The quality of the disks is excellent.

The Poirot episodes are unique in this current age of vulgarity and nudity. Poirot is family fare with no cursing (one of the episodes did have a dammed or two) and private body parts are kept under wraps. We enjoyed all the episodes but our favorites are in the approximately first half of the series which includes appearances of Captain Hastings,  Miss Lemon and Chief Inspector Japp. When they were no longer members of the cast we felt a decline in enjoyment although we continued to watch all the episodes.

Hercule Poirot is a prissy, faggoty type of individual but he does an outstanding job of acting and is very entertaining. There are beautiful women in every episode but Poirot does not hook up with them. He has a very high opinion of himself which adds to the entertainment factor. This is a series which I highly recommend.",1438473600,3,1011,4.543956043956044
6267287,4,B00IK43YOM,"I love having all the Poirot mysteries in one collection, and love David Suchet's portrayal.  I would have given it five stars if the quality had been a bit better.  Most of the shows are great quality, but a few are a bit grainy.  Not that it diminished my enjoyment much, but I felt that did diminish the rating I could give the product.",1437350400,3,339,4.265625

6267289,2,B00IK43YOM,"I was exceeded to get this product but never have I been disappointed in the video output of a blu-ray product until now. I realize that some of the films are old but I had older DVD versions of the films and had better picture quality with them than I than I do on the blu-ray disks. The video output of some mysteries are fine but some are horrible. I have not watched every mystery yet but so far the worst have been Five Little Pigs, Sad Cypress, and Mrs. McGintys Dead. The worst image effect are scenes are where background light hits and object, the object gets a glowing outline that is very wide (perhaps one to two inches wide relative to the scale on the screen). I had no issue watching my older DVDs but the blu-ray quality is so poor that I doubt I will ever watch them again.",1436572800,13,790,4.203947368421052

He always catches the killer in the end - with a neat twist! I rec'd. my order quickly. This series is one that I can watch again even though I know the ending. My guests have enjoyed watching it with us. It will be a great collection for the grand kids some day.,1436400000,,422,4.096385542168675

6267295,5,B00IK43YOM,"If you love David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, this is absolutely the collection for you. It has all of them, one just as good as the other. However, don't expect them to be in what you might call chronological order. I've started at the beginning with Season 1, Episode 1, and today I'm starting Season 4, Episode 1. In the beginning of Season 1, Hastings is Capt. Hastings. Then in a later episode (at this time I forgot which one and it may have even been later than Season 1) Hastings is still a lieutenant. However after that particular episode, he's a Capt. again and I'm still waiting to find out when he got promoted. But that doesn't take away my enjoyment of these DVDs one single bit. I hadn't realized how many Poirots there were until I bought this collection. I had seen many of them on TV but not all, and I'm very much enjoying the ones I hadn't seen but am just as much enjoying re-watching the ones I have. David Suchet IS Agatha Christie's Poirot - he jumped right out of the pages of her stories and directly on to TV and, from there, on to DVDs, and I'm very gratified that he did and that this collection is available.",1435363200,4,1137,4.317757009345795

6267298,5,B00IK43YOM,"This is one of the great mystery / sleuth series. David Suchet is Hercule Poirot. Netflix has some of the years, but not all. A little over half the seasons at the time of this review. The newer seasons have higher quality sound and picture. It's the little subtleties that make this such a wonderful adventure. The whole family can enjoy this series.",1434153600,,351,4.587301587301587
6267299,5,B00IK43YOM,"This has every single Poirot episode David Suchet has filmed, from the very first, ""The Adventure of the Clapham Cook"" in 1989, to ""Curtain: Poirot's Last Case"" in 2013. This is a total of 70 episodes, ranging from 57 minutes long (without commercials) to feature length. Fabulous characters all around - I am partial to the episodes with Captain Hastings, but I love the deducting and personalities in all of them.

With this Complete Collection, you get 33 DVD discs or 28 BluRay discs. Episodes have been remastered and restored. If you've seen the remastered sets of Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, you know how fabulous the BBC's remastered sets look!

I have attached photos showing a list of all episodes contained in this Complete Cases set.
In addition, you'll get these Bonus Features:
1. Being Poirot documentary (51 minutes): See David Suchet talk about his character as he films his last episodes as Poirot. They also interview Agatha Christie s grandson, Mathew Prichard.
2. Super Sleuths (47 min.): The cast and crew talk about this super series.
3. David Suchet on the Orient Express (47 min.): A tour of the Orient Express and its history with David Suchet.
4. Behind-the-scenes (46 min.) More time with cast and crew as they create Poirot for the screen.
5. Photo galleries
6. Production notes by David Suchet and Tim Curry. I have always been a fan of production notes. They give tidbits of information about the scenes shown.
7. Companion booklet with articles by David Suchet and Mathew Prichard, episode synopses; character profiles; information about Poirot
8. Poirots Obituary

Last, but not least, I recommend David Suchet's book, ""Poirot and Me"" (2013). He tells us how he created the character and gives anecdotes about filming. This is not a gossip dish - it is a fond look at the character and show Suchet made his own.

6267307,5,B00IK43YOM,"On the 7th series now.  Have watched 5-7 per week, as my family is mesmerized.  The quality is better than I thought reading some reviews.  The acting is impeccable for such a small time production.  Hugh Fraser, Phillip Jackson, and Pauline Moran provide perfect foils for David Suchet.  For those that have passionately read Agatha Christie, you probably have already seen these, so no need to go into title changes and scene/character alterations.  This is as close to the original as you will get, and with attention to detail that those other imitations did not even attempt.  I'm sorry, but Peter Ustinov or Tony Randall?  Nein!  It makes the little gray cells to hurt, mon ami! N'est-ce pas ?

6267355,5,B00IK43YOM,"I fell in love with the stories when I was a kid and watch Peter Ustinov as Poirot in Death on the Nile, and Evil Under the Sun; and while I still prefer those two particular adaptations to those done in this series, I have to say, this is a fantastically done. David Suchet does a marvelous job.  I was saddened to see it ending in 2014, but when the stories run out...so must the series.  I found, around the 9th season, that I felt sad at the end of many of the shows.  Poirot seemed sad and melancholy over his life, void of a love and children, missed. In particular, the end of 'Mystery of the Blue Train' and a certain point in 'Death on the Nile.' I cried after those and others.  A mark of a good series, when the audience feels true emotion for the character they have come to know and love.  I found myself wishing Poirot was a real person that I could be-friend and keep company.  Suchet, I'm sure, is proud of his accomplishments, as should all those that were involved with the making of these. I think I'll skip the last one, I think it's called, ""Curtain',  as this is when Poirot dies. I would've preferred Christie leaving him alive, with those he cared about, Hastings, and Miss Lemon, around him.  My only complaint, that they made his mustache to the extreme in the first years of the show. It truly looked ridiculous. I say that with love though...the last 3 to 5 seasons they tamed it a bit. ;)  A great series.  Thumbs up and 5 stars!",1422662400,4,1458,4.2690909090909095

Now, while generally one can view these stories in any order, there are some that, for the sake of continuity, must be re-arranged.  So, for those that are persnickety about viewing them in a proper chronological order (to the extent possible), there are a couple of things that need to be kept in mind.  So,...

You must start with ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"".  This story establishes Poirot in England with his fellow refugees from Belgium and the beginning of his relationship with Hastings.  This was filmed during the third or fouth season and is feature-length.

""Murder on the Orient Express"" must come before ""Murder in Mesopotamia"".  It will be a little jarring to see a much older Poirot (...Orient Express) then the one that appears in ""...Mesopotamia"".  But, there are subtle references in the latter that if seen before ""...Orient Express"" may make one to think: ""huh"".

""Mrs. McGiney's Dead"" should come before "" Hallowe'en Party"".

there are probably others, but these are the ones that come to mind.",1421884800,5,1113,4.924731182795699

6267368,5,B00IK43YOM,This set included some nice extras.  The Orient Express with David Suchet was well worth obtaining this outstanding set.  It is Agatha Christie at her best and Poirot is played to perfection by David Suchet.,1421625600,,207,4.885714285714286
6267369,5,B00IK43YOM,"A gift for my husband. He loves the Poirot Series. We watch at least one episode nearly each day. Some evenings we have watched 3 episodes. They are very entertaining. And, no commercials. If you are a Poirot fan, you will more than love this set.
The Poirot series is lighthearted, and we find him so amusing. So far, all of the DVD have played flawlessly. The storage box is is easy to use. Very nice. Delivery was quick. At the time when I purchases this set, it was about $100.00 ish less expensive here on amazon than I could find on my Internet search. Worth every penny.",1421452800,,577,4.351851851851852
6267370,4,B00IK43YOM,"As detective series go, Agatha Christie's Poirot lacks the cool of Stout's Nero Wolfe, the inscrutability of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse or the poignancy of Carol O'Connor's Kathleen Mallory.  But Poirot is an original and no one ever played him as well as David Suchet. His accomplishment is all the more remarkable when it's considered that he recently completed the dramatization of the entire body of Poirot stories.

Since there was no ""master plan"" when the series began filming in 1989, the chronology is a bit of a mess.  Series Three, for example, includes a story that is Poirot's first case in UK and stories when he has left London and moved into retirement in the country.  But Suchet rises to the challenge of playing the same character at different points in life--the hopeful refugee who has fled Belgium; the proud, famous London detective; the weary retiree who has seen too much of human nature.  Suchet draws your focus at all phases of Poirot;s life, even if you wish more of his internal monologue was shared.  That was not Christie's strong suit and it affects the overall series, written and dramatized..  It's also fun to see young British actors who over the years of filming (1989 to 2013) grew in stature from Poirot's guest of the week to feature film stars.

So, get the set, kick back and enjoy this labor of love.",1421366400,9,1348,4.755364806866953

*Production notes by David Suchet and Tim Curry

I have completed watching all 70 episodes in this series (broadcast from 1989-2014) plus the bonus features. One reason why this series is such an extraordinary achievement is because the creators worked over 25 years to film all of the Hercule Poirot stories (with minor exceptions), something never previously done. It is viewed and loved by millions of people in many nations throughout the world, and deservedly so.

This Blu-ray set is nicely done. It has 28 disks in 4 cases.
26 blu-ray disks contain the 70 episodes which appear in original UK broadcast order.
2 DVD disks contain additional Bonus Features.
Each case conveniently lists the disk contents on the back so it is relatively easy to find episodes or features one is looking for.

For the most part, the Blu-ray audio and video quality is good considering that Season 1 was released in 1989. However, there is one poorer quality exception that stands out: I found the comparatively poor video quality of Series 11 'Mrs. McGinty's Dead' quite jarring in comparison to the episodes that preceded it. I was so taken aback that I did a little research and learned that it was unfortunately filmed in low resolution PAL video.

Over all production standards in the series are excellent, including talented performers, great sets with 1930s period features and costumes, beautiful locations, photography and music. In a few instances I did not like how the script deviated from the books, but such things are a matter of personal opinion.

I stand in awe and gratitude to David Suchet for his extraordinary dedication and faithfulness in striving to accurately portray Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot over those 25 years. One of my main reasons for writing this review is to express my gratitude to him. He was determined to remain faithful to Christie's vision, so he studied all of her Poirot writings and created a list of 93 descriptions and characterizations of him that she had given. For instance:
He studied various French accents to finally develope what would be appropriate for a Belgian many mistakenly believe is French.
He actualized Poirot's mannerisms such as the way he walked, his obsessive fastidiousness and longing for neatness and symmetry.
He brought to life a multi-dimensional character who was intelligent, thoughtful, warm and quirky.
In everything he always remained faithful to Agatha Christie's vision of Poirot, and she would have been grateful and quite pleased. As many people so rightly have said, David Suchet is 'THE Hercule Poirot!'

Viewers can learn more about David Suchet and the series in the Bonus Features included in this set. These take viewers to Agatha Christie's former home and other locations in the series, and offer interviews with Christie's grandson Matthew Prichard as well as the cast and crew. The Bonus Features are informative and enjoyable to watch.

I've read many of the Poirot stories and it was quite enjoyable to see them come alive on screen in such fine productions, and I look forward to reading all of the books and re-watching these films over the coming years.",1420243200,26,4689,5.134993446920053

6267405,5,B00IK43YOM,"I'm very, VERY pleased with this complete packaging of ""Agatha Christie's Complete Cases Collection"" put to Blu-ray Disc format. Regarding some of the ""negative"" comments complaining about poor picture quality of some of these films, people are forgetting that the early films in this collection go all the way back to 1989. Back then Blu-ray, which supports the High Resolution (HD) 1920x1080 ""16:9"" screen format of today, didn't exist. Back then Poriot was filmed via ""Panaflex 16 (R) Camera by Panavision (R)"", which is a 16mm film format, more than adequate for the low resolution, ""4:3"" screen format of television of the time. Check the ending credits for yourselves; you'll see ""Panaflex 16 (R) Camera by Panavision (R)"" displayed.  Even so, in my opinion the picture quality of this re-packaging via Blu-ray format is still better than my old Poirot collection via the DVD format, which I've passed on to my son.",1419379200,29,921,5.059210526315789

6267407,5,B00IK43YOM,"I LOVE this series.  I purchased this set because I think it has ALL of the episodes and movies that star David Suchet in it as Poirot.  The quality has been good thus far (I'm only through the 2nd disc at this point) and I am pleased with the packaging.  The box top comes off and the front of the box folds down so it is easy to get the individual season boxes in and out.

6267409,2,B00IK43YOM,"bought the complete DVD boxset, but was wondering if I should have gotten the blu-ray so I borrowed Season 1 from a library. I was shocked to find out the runtimes of the dvds are like the old dvds - 2 minutes shorter with higher-pitched audio. In other words, the PAL versions (but converted for ntsc playback). I thought they were taken from the same masters as the blu-ray which are the correct film speed. There was at least one exception - THE DREAM was the same runtime, although I don't know if that means both are film speed, or both are PAL speed.
The blu-ray weren't exactly perfect either. End credits music sometimes cut-off a tad, motion looked odd, and the increase in sharpness exaggerated the grain which sometimes showed up like snow over the picture.",1419033600,44,768,4.613138686131387
6267410,5,B00IK43YOM,"Absolutely no one but David Suchet could play the magnificent Poirot. The Complete Cases Collection by Agatha Christie is fantastic. Although I have seen all of these cases before, re-watching them lets me see different aspects of Poirot's hand movements, how he detects the smallest of clues, questions he puts before a possible subject ... so many things to see and hear. I love watching Poirot at the beginning of each show ... the way his demeanor and impeccable dress leads you to the tipping of his hat. The music? It is distinctly POIROT!",1418860800,2,545,4.808510638297872
6267411,5,B00IK43YOM,"A Must have for any true Poirot fan , all episodes have been remastered  so everything looks fantastic. Every episode ever is in this set along with a couple of extra's such as an interview with David Suchet.",1418774400,2,208,4.473684210526316
6267412,5,B00IK43YOM,"The entire Poirot series in one neat package--since I did not own any of the series, this is a great bargain.  The packaging is neat and practical--open the lid, and the front wall folds down making it easy to remove one of the individual multi-disk packs.

I ordered the Bluray version of this.  Previously I had seen DVD versions of Poirot or the DVD-definition streaming version.  I'm happy to say that the Bluray does look better (from what I've seen so far, I'm on season 2) even if some of it isn't quite up to a modern Hollywood movie.  The biggest bonus to me for the Bluray is the lack of interlacing lines--those lines bug the crap out of me.  I guess some people are more sensitive to those than others, to me they are really bothersome, but there are none here.

A person should keep in mind when watching these movies that they are set in the 1930s, and the original stories were written in a time when some attitudes were different.

The costumes, furniture, cars and general set designs are great--they give a rather authentic feel for a past time.

Poirot episodes are just the thing when you are feeling tired after a long week or feeling sick and want to bundle up in blankets and watch something entertaining.",1418515200,8,1228,4.520361990950226
