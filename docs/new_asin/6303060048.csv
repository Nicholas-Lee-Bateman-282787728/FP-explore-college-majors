544557,3,6303060048,"I'm not really big on musicals, but I am a big Jimmy Stewart buff.  This is typical Stewart, high on fun and frolic, low on isues of substance.  Music good .... greed bad.  Okay by me.

544558,2,6303060048,"The strength of the film is its technical aspect. For the time, the special effects are quite good. Acting is also strong. I was disappointed in the plot. The script just doesn't accomplish the job. Essentially the theme is ""art"" (in this case music)is superior to business. All business people are evil and only artists know how to celebrate life. Violence, robbery, and deception of any kind is justified to teach the evil businessman a lesson. That's the subplot that just doesn't hold up.

Jimmy Stewart's character, working with Paulette Goddard's character, ""save the day"" by staging a lottery, which they have previously discussed was not legal. Here again, there's no logic. They do the very thing the script writers prohibited them from doing. It's a non sequituer.",1113177600,2,774,5.046875
544559,5,6303060048,"""Pot O' Gold"" is a Jimmy Stewart film I watch repeatedly and I'm glad I'm not the only one who has heard of it. This film has been released so many time on VHS, and by all never-heard-of studios. United Artists released it to theaters at the time. Why didn't MGM buy the rights to the film years after? Great story about a struggling musician trying to save his father's music store. His notrious health-food obsessed uncle tries to pull Jimmy Haskell (Stewart) into the the health-food business. He meets a beautiful lady singer (Paulette Goddard) who with her other sister sing a band which her brother Willie plays in, and her mother runs it. When Molly McCorckle (Goddard) learns that Jimmy's uncle is the notorius C.J. Haskell, she becomes upset about it. She thinks of him as a trickster, and as a result, in a radio program she announces Jimmy will give away $1000 in cash to someone. Jimmy is faced with a tough decision: how to give away the money. If he doesn't, he coul be fined and imprisoned. After many tries, he thinks up a way. He'll give it away by telephone. The winner, when they call them up, is speechless and so is his wife. Mrs. McCorckle, C.J., Jimmy, and Molly all reunite on the radio program in a triumphant-sounding finale.
The sound could be better, but an excellent film to enjoy anytime. Upbeat!",1034208000,26,1326,4.57563025210084

He is as good as ever, fighting against cruel big business and standing up for the little man, which in this case is a boarding house band. The swing music is fantastic, James Stewart's harmonica playing and occasional singing is excellent, the plot is remarkably coherent, and the whole film is absolutely hilarious.

544914,5,6303060048,"He Kept it Failing Successfully for 25 Years..

Beautifully restored romantic, musical comedy. Another excellent quality transfer from DigiComTV. Hilarious, madcap comedy set in the 1940s featuring Jimmy Stewart as a failing music store owner whose insanely funny uncle wants him to join his food factory business. Stewart winds up befriending his uncles worst nightmare  a family of Irish musicians who are constantly practicing, and unnerving the music-hating uncle whose food factory is right next door.

One thing leads to another and Stewart and his uncle wind up jailed over a tomato-throwing incident gone awry. In the midst of all this chaos is beautiful Paulette Goddard, who is also a member of the musical Irish family next door. She finds herself getting caught up not only in Stewarts problems, but the uncles as well. Goddard is totally unaware that Stewart and his uncle are related. This she finds out at toward the end of the film. In the meantime, she begins to fall in love with Stewart as the speed of comedic events begin to pick up.

Stewart finds himself trying to help the Irish family get gigs. He ends up placing them on his uncles radio show while he has cleverly shuffled his music-hating uncle off to Canada. The radio show is a big success with the Irish musicians, and Goddard decides to announce there will be a $1,000 giveaway every week on the program. Now, how does one sort out this mess? Giving away money on a radio show is illegal.

Hijinks abound as Stewart and Goddard try to figure out how they are going to legally give away $1,000 a week. The uncle returns from Canada just as they have figured out a solution to the giveaway.

Happy endings for all when advertising sponsors want to purchase the successful program from the music-hating uncle, while at the same time Stewart announces his engagement to Goddard over the air.

This film is peppered throughout with absolutely hysterical scenes and madcap adventures. A real classic youll want to watch over and over. Its laughter and gaiety is as relevant now as it certainly was in the 1940s. This film will definitely keep you in stitches..",1434844800,,2136,4.819672131147541

544973,4,6303060048,"For some reason, ""Pot o' Gold"" hadn't come to my attention until now, and enjoyable as it is, it is not what I could have anticipated: a madcap, quasi-musical. I had to remind myself the movie was made just after the conclusion of America's more than three-and-a-half year participation in an arduous and exacting war. A heaping dose of escape and jollity was in order and this olio of almost believable nonsense must have been sweetened medicine to its audiences.
""Pot o' Gold"" may be the only full length movie to come out of James Roosevelt's Globe Productions. James, the eldest son of Franklin D., was a Marine Corps hero and something of a co-founder of the O.S.S under ""Wild"" Bill Donovan; he cut his teeth in films working for Samuel Goldwyn as a vice president of productions. In 1939, and concurrent with his work at Goldwyn, Roosevelt founded Globe and began to produce short films. ""Pot o' Gold"" had been aired originally on radio before being turned into a full-length movie.
In the late forties, if the American film industry had anything it had a cornucopia of magnificent supporting actors whose stage and screen experiences were solid. The cast of this zany romp runs like a mother's lode of pure silver from the top of the cast to the final billing.
""Pot o' Gold"" was not made for the critics or for devotees of the fine arts; it's a nakedly tongue-in-cheek and brilliantly idiotic horsing around. Like mom's chicken soup, it's meant to be enjoyed; and yes, like mom's chicken soup or a sweetened elixir, its medicinal qualities are something we can still stand a bit of.",1341619200,2,1589,4.719424460431655
544974,5,6303060048,"I checked this movie out of my local public library and found it to be a very pleasing and light-hearted film.  It is a musical of sorts that features Jimmy Stewart as the nephew of a cold-hearted and disliked business man in town.  By a series of coincidences Jimmy Stewart becomes the one who hits his uncle in the face with a rotten tomato.  An event which makes him a hero to the MacCorkadales, but causes him to try and hide his true identity for a while.  It is hard to tell if it is really Jimmy Stewart who is playing the harmonica and singing, but it sure does look and sound like it is which is impressive.  Paulette Goddard as the daughter of Mrs. MacCorkadale is featured singing in a low voice which is nonetheless pleasing.  And her spirit throughout the film is charming.  All in all, it is just plain a good clean fun film.",1333843200,3,839,4.305732484076433

544976,5,6303060048,"Many classic films which have fallen into the public domain over the years are often unfairly dismissed. Such is the case with this little gem. ""Pot O' Gold"" is a fun and happy little film starring Jimmy Stewart and Paulette Goddard. Released through Mary Pickford's United Artist company, the two leads are members of two feuding families who fall for each other. The riff is over music and a piece of property Jimmy's music hating Uncle Charly (Charles Winninger) wants to acquire so he can expand his lucrative health food business. He also wants Jimmy to help him run the business.

When Jimmy becomes a hero to the McCorckles, especially Molly (Paulette Goddard), by means of an errantly thrown tomato, he has to hide the fact that he's a Haskel. Horace Heidt, whose band has been practicing at Molly's mother's, figures out Jimmy's ruse and the two scheme to get Charly out of town so they can use his radio show to promote the band. Once Molly discovers the truth, however, everything goes south when she announces a hefty cash sum will be given each week on the show! Personal and legal chaos results, of course, and when Charly gets wind of what's going on live he hightails it back to the city.

While this wasn't Stewart's favorite, it plays much better today. It is bolstered by a charming atmosphere and pleasant tunes, allowing it to weather time well. Slight to be sure, but a fun distraction perfect for a lazy weekend. This particular DVD is a fairly decent print and quite watchable. The Image print is best, but this one is okay if you aren't fussy. Proof that even lesser films of yesterday have more charm and entertainment value than most of what we see today.

544977,5,6303060048,"This review is about, yes, A Big Band-Aid. A struggling Big Band needs help getting noticed and getting its big break. Jimmy Stewart (Jimmy) inherits his father's music store which is a hang-out for young, practicing, musicians. Jimmy plays a mean harmonica himself. His wealthy uncle who hosts a radio program called Harry's Happy Hour looks down his nose at the music store enterprise and offers to help Jimmy make it big if he will leave and join him. Harry hates all music and can't stand to even listen to it. Jimmy is forced to leave the foundering store and move into McCorkles' Boarding house. The beautiful McCorkle daughter (Paulette Goddard) is also the lead vocalist for the Big Band. When Jimmy and Uncle Harry both get thrown into the clinker through strange events, the uncle decides he needs to calm his nerves in Canada for a couple of weeks and leaves Jimmy in charge of his program. The whole group of musicians, Jimmy, and the McCorkles figure out a way to put the band on the air during the radio show and to even offer the listening audience a chance to win big money by spinning a wheel. The Band is a big success and gaining valuable sponsors for their air time, when Uncle Harry comes back from Canada, furious, as he did not want any music on his show. Uncle Harry has provided us with much slapstick comedy throughout the movie. The surprise in this movie (Jimmy S. is ALWAYS good) is the array of wonderful song and dance numbers and that Big Band sound. The song and dance routine in the jail cell, is very good. The ""Knife Fork and Spoon"" routine at the dining table in McCorkles' Boarding House is a work of genius, and the Rhumba numbers are glamour personified. After many spats between Jimmy and Miss McCorkle, love wins out and everyone is happy. A great movie made better by the song and dance extravaganza.",1268784000,8,1843,4.570996978851964

For all those who criticize this movie, I will admit it is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best, but it is decent, charming, and full of pleasant songs.  It also gives my kids a glimpse into the World War II/swing music era and gives us a good backdrop for stories about their grandparents.
My children love the songs and have them all memorized.  My little girl especially loves singing ""Do You Believe in Fairy Tales?"" and sings it to our little baby. :-)  My older son is all gung-ho to learn to play the harmonica as well.  As far as the actual story line is concerned, we don't get into it that much, playing it mostly for the music, but we will get into that as they get older.  The moral we have learned and will pass on to the children is that the pursuit of wealth should never become an end in itself, and that a balance is essential to proper mental, emotional and spiritual growth.",1188604800,18,1139,4.349056603773585
