8684287,5,B00OMCM9Q0,"One of Ingmar Bergman's earliest films is also one of his best! While the print is not pristine, the film was made on the cheap, using sets
from another film. Consequently it is a perfect example of a great filmmaker trying out his style on the cheap. And he succeeds, wonderfully!",1466121600,4,281,4.529411764705882
8684288,2,B00OMCM9Q0,"My rating is for this particular DVD reproduction of the film, not the film itself.

I wasn't expecting perfection, but while the picture quality isn't horrendous, it's bad enough that many subtitles are washed out and essentially illegible. I watched about five minutes of the film before giving up in frustration.",1429056000,4,315,5.176470588235294
