3117527,4,B0013LRKSA,I enjoyed this movie very much. It was better to me than preaching to the choir and The Gospel.,1214179200,,95,4.052631578947368
3117528,4,B0013LRKSA,I LIKED IT WAS SOMETHING DIFFRENT THAT BOTH GOLDEN BROOKS PLAYED AND ALSO DARREN DEWITT PLAYED AS WELL THE MOVIE CAPTURED WHAT A WOMAN WOULD DO JUST TO KNOW THAT SHE DOES HAVE A GOOD MAN AND WHAT SHE COULD DO TO REALIZE HOW SHE KNOWS THAT SHE HAS A GOOD MAN. DEBROAH COX AND DARIUS M. IS IN THE MOVIE (FAMILY MATTERS) AS WELL WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF PEOPLE THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT MOVIE BUT WORTH THE TIME TO WATCH.!!!!,1214092800,,416,4.148148148148148
3117529,2,B0013LRKSA,"This movie was just OK. Considering the actors involved, I expected better acting. A movie with the title ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"", should have focused more on what a ""good man"" endures and tries to accomplish in his everyday life.
The lead male character is a blue-collar worker who is married to a newly accomplished MBA graduate. The husband has paid for her education and at one point in the movie she practically emasculates him by saying that his brain is small and she should have never married a blue-collar man. Oddly enough, her despicable behavior in this scene is never addressed again in the movie. This is one of the things that is experienced by many good men in the African-American community. A man who tries to be the best man he can be, but is constantly berated by his woman, because he drives a bus, or cleans floors. The movie could have dealt with this on some level, but failed to really make a point in the end.",1213142400,7,940,4.4393063583815024
3117530,3,B0013LRKSA,"I noticed Deborah Cox is in this, so I decided to watch it. I love listening to her songs; especially ""Who Do U Love"". I can't say I loved this movie, though. It was just okay. What I will say is that I would have given it a different title - ""A Hard Workin' Man Deserves Respect"" sounds about right.",1211068800,,300,4.016666666666667
3117531,2,B0013LRKSA,"I love Golden Brooke and Darrin Dewin Henson (he played a much better church man in Fabric of a Man) but this was a dud for me. It had its moments here and there but most of the movie was very predictable and seem to drag on. It lacked any type of oomph and the moments you were left wanting to know more it just cut to the next scene, and never went back to wrap that issue up. Sorry this one didn't do it for me.",1210896000,4,414,3.7701149425287355
3117532,3,B0013LRKSA,"I must say I just watched this movie and it wasn't your ordinary ""Sunday Church"" movie.  It dealt with marriage, adultery, domestic violence, drugs, and alcohol, and then some.  I thought it was an awesome movie and enjoyed it from beginning to end.",1210809600,2,249,4.767441860465116
3117533,2,B0013LRKSA,I'm sorry..this movie lacked the hype I expected. I think the director took away the talent these true actors and actresses had to offer. But then again most of CodeBlack entertainment films are poor in quality and production.,1210723200,9,226,4.973684210526316

3117603,2,B0013LRKSA,"I only rate it 2 stars PURELY based on the talent casted for it! Otherwise, an inconsistent, choppy, lame piece of work. Although predictable, the plot would be decent IF these actors had a good script to go on! Each does the best they can with what little they're given. If you're watching this movie JUST because it's a black cast, you may enjoy it! However, if you're expecting a great movie with a great black cast, you won't!",1402963200,,430,4.455696202531645

3117622,5,B0013LRKSA,"So many lessons in this film.  For not only a Black American family, but any family.

3117623,4,B0013LRKSA,"I watch movies that relax and entertain me. While this wasn't Oscar material and had a lot of predictability, it was an enjoyable movie just to enjoy and take your mind off your problems for a little while. This was a good movie that had a positive male role model as the lead character and showed the struggles and temptations of a couple going through a rough point in their marriage. I gave it four stars not because I would consider it a four star movie (realistically compared to a real four star movie it might only be 2 or 3 stars.) But I gave it four stars because that as how much I enjoyed, derived pleasure from watching it, in the same way someone loves their favorite soap opera show. A soap opera might not be four star worthy cinema but it might give you four star pleasure if you're a fan. Thus, if you're a fan of romances that have an African American church theme to them, i.e. a positive message, then this is the movie for you.",1378339200,,948,4.272222222222222
3117624,1,B0013LRKSA,"I'm all for a good movie about marriage and the struggles of temptation...when it's done right.  A Good Man is Hard to Find, fell short.  Actually, it was just really bad.  Not only was the editing (short choppy scenes) and acting painful to watch, but the whole story line between the two main characters was weak at best.  I think the creators/writers/directors of this movie wanted you to feel for this couple and express a broken marriage that can be fixed through forgiveness and repentance, but I didn't see ""true repentance"" in this movie.  Or at least I didn't get it.  The main character cheated on her husband and instead of saying I'm sorry for what I did...PERIOD, it was more like, ""Honey, I'm sorry I cheated on you, but I would't of done it if you would of put me first in your life.  Dump all that stuff you do for the Lord and worship me.""  (emphasis mine)  Really?  Ummm, yeah no!",1371081600,,898,4.45398773006135

3117640,5,B0013LRKSA,"Relationships should be between two people, and never invite a third party into your business.

3117641,5,B0013LRKSA,"Wow, this is a wonderful movie...  We loved the plot, we loved the characters and the scenes were awesome.. We watch this movie all the time and are very happy to own this movie..

There is a need for more movies like this.. This was a great addition to our movie collection.

If you are looking for a positive happy movie with comedy, drama and romance etc all in one this movie is for you. A wonderful love story to us..

This is a good movies for couples night, or couples study groups, it shows what couples can go through when one's focus is not totally in the home, and one is being pulled in different ways. It also touches on how when couples begin to go in different directions.

This will show you how someone can come in between you when you are not in communication with one another and on different pages with each other. Good men really are hard to find, this movie will also help single ladies and gentlemen to see what goes on in marriages and how marriages can become broken. We think married and singles should view this movie before they marry and after they marry.

Now as far as the negative reviews, many children, teens of today look older than their parents.. They don't look as young as the children did who were born before the 80's. I don't know if it is the food we are eating, or the water we drink. We believe the son in this movie, played his role well.

As far as the title, well good men are hard to find. Many people are looking for good men, when there is one standing right in front of them. Many people look for better things in other places instead of taking the time to look at home, many don't take the time to look at what they already have.

This movie shows that message.. We think this movie delivered that message very well.. That is why so many homes are broken today, looking to greener pastures, only to find out it turns brown and is fake grass. Many people don't understand the dynamics children bring into a marriage.. and what about when people have children when they are young in high school and decide to marry and stay together, yeah they are young, their children may look older then them... There are many women and men who are old and you can't tell their age... They age well.

Many people will be able to relate to this movie.. My co worker also viewed the movie and she loves it as well and she is single...

As far as the son fighting his father,, no this happens for real.. you have rebellious children that fight there parents and anyone who will step in their way and if this movie can help rebellious children find their way, then yes it is priceless...

More men should fight to keep their families together and put their children in their places.. Maybe we would not have so many rebellious children, which is the next generation to take place and run our country.. What is wrong with a father trying to place order in his home. Many marriages go through these types of test every single day... We love the message that this movie delivers.

We will continue to share this movie with couples, other family members, friends and as many people as we can. This movie can be used as a teaching tool in so many different ways. Men can have a men's group watch. This is one way they can see how it looks when they neglect their wives.. This is one why for men and women to see that home comes first. etc

See this movie for your self and make your on judgement. We are telling you if you skip this movie, you will miss out..

Cry, laugh, and be inspired....

Enjoy....",1322352000,,3531,4.32072617246596
3117642,5,B0013LRKSA,"This was a good movie watched it over and over.  You have to really check in to life to get this.  You don't have to say alot.  Be married and have a man that everyone in the world see as a good man in the church, community, helping every body but you.  He is good but a woman needs to be able to amen that.  If she is missing all that good man the he needs to marry then world and set her free.  It shows that people that are doing good need a reality check sometime too.  But, to see the end results make it all worth happening.  Put your heart into the movie.  Look at the movie learn something.  I really feel it.",1305676800,,617,3.864

3117645,3,B0013LRKSA,"I just watched this film last night on tv. I'd taped it the night before. I had never heard of it and didn't know who was in it. The title spoke to me as a black man though, plus I just thought it sounded interesting. This film has a good all-around cast. Talented and attractive black actors.

I didn't think I'd really like it, and certainly didn't think I'd end up watching the entire fim like I ended up doing. To say most black films underwhelm me, would be an understatement. This is an interesting film with an interesting and good message though. Mainly talks about the idea of women marrying down, and where the church places in a spiritual/god-fearing couples marriage. Unfortunately I think the film left too many questions unasked and/or unanswered to truly be great. I think it's heart was in the right place though. Maybe should have been 30 minutes longer. A good cast, with some very beautiful black women, made it worth watching though.",1277164800,,953,4.6390532544378695

It could have just been in the editing but ""Editing"" is very important to any film.

Listening to a friend, I bought this movie thinking it was good, I mean look at all the good actors in it? ""A Good Man Is Hard To Find"" = ""A Good Script Is Hard To Find."" This movie was aimless, all over the place and I had to force myself to watch all of it. Weak, weak, weak.

First of all, their son was older than they were. You remember how Cuba
Gooding, Jr. looked too old to be Laurence Fishbourne's son in ""Boyz In The Hood""? Well, the son looked like he was in his late 20's and his parents looked like they were in their early 30's so they obviously had him when they were six making him a biological miracle.

This movie is slow moving, had poorly written scenes, left too many strings untied, and there was too much talent wasted on this film. Also, the title of the movie had nothing to do with its content. It should have been titled ""Boring Movie"" or ""Wasted Talent"".

I gave this movie to the friend who suggested it. I hope she makes it a happy home because it would only be in my way and take up space.",1230076800,24,1136,4.04

3117681,3,B0013LRKSA,"...but apparently a good movie is too!  In spite of the caliber of the featured actors and actresses, I was left a bit lost and confused in the end.

Let me begin by saying Hill Harper did an excellent job as the charming-turned-cold boss, as did Melissa de Sousa and Mel Jackson as the high maintenance best friend and Renaissance man respectively.

I was thoroughly disappointed with the choppy story line that seemed to jump from one extreme to another, enabling most of the characters to fully develop.  Also, some scenes (such as the throwing of the liquor bottle, the son fighting with his father) were overdramatized to the point of being ridiculous and ultimately irrelevant.

I understand the multiple messages that the movie conveyed in regards to being faithful, the importance of building a strong spiritual foundation within yourself and your family, and appreciating the things that you have instead of lusting after the things you don't need, but I just expected more.

I recommend renting the movie first before buying it; it should be available at your local video store.",1222300800,5,1088,4.950549450549451

3117684,5,B0013LRKSA,"I am a married woman and this movie brought me to tears.  The couple (Golden Brook's character and Darrin's character)at the center of the plot seems to have it all, but they both find themselves unhappily married.  Their union is put to the ultimate test and it survives.  I have some of the same struggles the woman complains about in her marriage.  You have a good man and you know it, but it's really difficult to get through to him that he needs to spend time with you and notice you.  I am definitely going to watch the movie again with my husband.  It stays true to Christian values and would be a great resource for marriage counseling.  I also plan to share the movie with as many couples as I can.  If you need a constructive perspective this is a movie for you.",1216339200,,772,4.3125

The editing or the script or the direction of this movie needed a bandaid because I ended up turning this movie off, which saddened me b/c most of the cast are my favorite actors/actresses. I didn't get why someone had an attitude one minute and then there was a clip of the same person two seconds later wanting to get it on, that was DUMB.

I don't knwo some movies there doesn't need to be a story, you just want to see your favorite actor/tress on screen, but this movie, i was like what is the point of this movie? church, love, what? 2 many subplots, the lighting was good for a low budget movie.",1214524800,,762,4.183673469387755

3352026,2,B0013LRKSA,"This movie was just OK. Considering the actors involved, I expected better acting. A movie with the title ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"", should have focused more on what a ""good man"" endures and tries to accomplish in his everyday life.
The lead male character is a blue-collar worker who is married to a newly accomplished MBA graduate. The husband has paid for her education and at one point in the movie she practically emasculates him by saying that his brain is small and she should have never married a blue-collar man. Oddly enough, her despicable behavior in this scene is never addressed again in the movie. This is one of the things that is experienced by many good men in the African-American community. A man who tries to be the best man he can be, but is constantly berated by his woman, because he drives a bus, or cleans floors. The movie could have dealt with this on some level, but failed to really make a point in the end.",1213142400,7,940,4.4393063583815024

While this wasn't Oscar material and had a lot of predictability, it was an enjoyable movie just to enjoy and take your mind off your problems for a little while. This was a good movie that had a positive male role model as the lead character and showed the struggles and temptations of a couple going through a rough point in their marriage. I gave it four stars not because I would consider it a four star movie (realistically compared to a real four star movie it might only be 2 or 3 stars.) But I gave it four stars because that as how much I enjoyed, derived pleasure from watching it, in the same way someone loves their favorite soap opera show. A soap opera might not be four star worthy cinema but it might give you four star pleasure if you're a fan.

Not only was the editing (short choppy scenes) and acting painful to watch, but the whole story line between the two main characters was weak at best.  I think the creators/writers/directors of this movie wanted you to feel for this couple and express a broken marriage that can be fixed through forgiveness and repentance, but I didn't see ""true repentance"" in this movie.  Or at least I didn't get it.  The main character cheated on her husband and instead of saying I'm sorry for what I did...PERIOD, it was more like, ""Honey, I'm sorry I cheated on you, but I would't of done it if you would of put me first in your life.

3352138,5,B0013LRKSA,"Wow, this is a wonderful movie...  We loved the plot, we loved the characters and the scenes were awesome.. We watch this movie all the time and are very happy to own this movie..

There is a need for more movies like this.. This was a great addition to our movie collection.

If you are looking for a positive happy movie with comedy, drama and romance etc all in one this movie is for you. A wonderful love story to us..

This is a good movies for couples night, or couples study groups, it shows what couples can go through when one's focus is not totally in the home, and one is being pulled in different ways. It also touches on how when couples begin to go in different directions.

This will show you how someone can come in between you when you are not in communication with one another and on different pages with each other. Good men really are hard to find, this movie will also help single ladies and gentlemen to see what goes on in marriages and how marriages can become broken. We think married and singles should view this movie before they marry and after they marry.

Now as far as the negative reviews, many children, teens of today look older than their parents.. They don't look as young as the children did who were born before the 80's. I don't know if it is the food we are eating, or the water we drink. We believe the son in this movie, played his role well.

As far as the title, well good men are hard to find. Many people are looking for good men, when there is one standing right in front of them. Many people look for better things in other places instead of taking the time to look at home, many don't take the time to look at what they already have.

This movie shows that message.. We think this movie delivered that message very well.. That is why so many homes are broken today, looking to greener pastures, only to find out it turns brown and is fake grass. Many people don't understand the dynamics children bring into a marriage.. and what about when people have children when they are young in high school and decide to marry and stay together, yeah they are young, their children may look older then them... There are many women and men who are old and you can't tell their age... They age well.

Many people will be able to relate to this movie.. My co worker also viewed the movie and she loves it as well and she is single...

As far as the son fighting his father,, no this happens for real.. you have rebellious children that fight there parents and anyone who will step in their way and if this movie can help rebellious children find their way, then yes it is priceless...

More men should fight to keep their families together and put their children in their places.. Maybe we would not have so many rebellious children, which is the next generation to take place and run our country.. What is wrong with a father trying to place order in his home. Many marriages go through these types of test every single day... We love the message that this movie delivers.

We will continue to share this movie with couples, other family members, friends and as many people as we can. This movie can be used as a teaching tool in so many different ways. Men can have a men's group watch. This is one way they can see how it looks when they neglect their wives.. This is one why for men and women to see that home comes first. etc

See this movie for your self and make your on judgement. We are telling you if you skip this movie, you will miss out..

Cry, laugh, and be inspired....

Enjoy....",1322352000,,3531,4.32072617246596

If she is missing all that good man the he needs to marry then world and set her free.  It shows that people that are doing good need a reality check sometime too.

The title spoke to me as a black man though, plus I just thought it sounded interesting. This film has a good all-around cast. Talented and attractive black actors.

I didn't think I'd really like it, and certainly didn't think I'd end up watching the entire fim like I ended up doing. To say most black films underwhelm me, would be an understatement. This is an interesting film with an interesting and good message though. Mainly talks about the idea of women marrying down, and where the church places in a spiritual/god-fearing couples marriage. Unfortunately I think the film left too many questions unasked and/or unanswered to truly be great. I think it's heart was in the right place though. Maybe should have been 30 minutes longer.

This movie was aimless, all over the place and I had to force myself to watch all of it. Weak, weak, weak.

First of all, their son was older than they were. You remember how Cuba
Gooding, Jr. looked too old to be Laurence Fishbourne's son in ""Boyz In The Hood""? Well, the son looked like he was in his late 20's and his parents looked like they were in their early 30's so they obviously had him when they were six making him a biological miracle.

This movie is slow moving, had poorly written scenes, left too many strings untied, and there was too much talent wasted on this film. Also, the title of the movie had nothing to do with its content. It should have been titled ""Boring Movie"" or ""Wasted Talent"".

Let me begin by saying Hill Harper did an excellent job as the charming-turned-cold boss, as did Melissa de Sousa and Mel Jackson as the high maintenance best friend and Renaissance man respectively.

I was thoroughly disappointed with the choppy story line that seemed to jump from one extreme to another, enabling most of the characters to fully develop.  Also, some scenes (such as the throwing of the liquor bottle, the son fighting with his father) were overdramatized to the point of being ridiculous and ultimately irrelevant.

I understand the multiple messages that the movie conveyed in regards to being faithful, the importance of building a strong spiritual foundation within yourself and your family, and appreciating the things that you have instead of lusting after the things you don't need, but I just expected more.

I recommend renting the movie first before buying it; it should be available at your local video store.",1222300800,5,1088,4.950549450549451

3352181,5,B0013LRKSA,"I am a married woman and this movie brought me to tears.  The couple (Golden Brook's character and Darrin's character)at the center of the plot seems to have it all, but they both find themselves unhappily married.  Their union is put to the ultimate test and it survives.  I have some of the same struggles the woman complains about in her marriage.  You have a good man and you know it, but it's really difficult to get through to him that he needs to spend time with you and notice you.  I am definitely going to watch the movie again with my husband.  It stays true to Christian values and would be a great resource for marriage counseling.  I also plan to share the movie with as many couples as I can.  If you need a constructive perspective this is a movie for you.",1216339200,,772,4.3125
3352182,3,B0013LRKSA,"First off this is a terrible title for the movie!!!! The main character is a good man, but he didn't get what he needed to do, and neither did the female lead. The editing or the script or the direction of this movie needed a bandaid because I ended up turning this movie off, which saddened me b/c most of the cast are my favorite actors/actresses. I didn't get why someone had an attitude one minute and then there was a clip of the same person two seconds later wanting to get it on, that was DUMB.

I don't knwo some movies there doesn't need to be a story, you just want to see your favorite actor/tress on screen, but this movie, i was like what is the point of this movie? church, love, what? 2 many subplots, the lighting was good for a low budget movie.",1214524800,,762,4.183673469387755

8251987,1,B0013LRKSA,"An hour & a half of this short life = wasted.

Picked it up at the local dollar store ... & overpaid at that.

Thought it was a Christian movie ... more like a worldly, 'hard pg-13' - with no reason for a christian (or a non-christian) - to bother with.

Watched it all thinking / hoping - there would be some redeeming value ... there wasn't.

Physically attractive cast - with mostly dark hearts (as portrayed).

recommendation = avoid.

ps.  for GREAT christian films be sure to see:  LILIES of the FIELD' & 'WAR ROOM' (other films by the Kendrick Brothers are all good, also).",1519171200,,580,4.40566037735849
