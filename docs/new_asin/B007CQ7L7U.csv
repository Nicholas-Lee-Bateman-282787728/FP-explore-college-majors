8514671,5,B007CQ7L7U,"Tony Palmer's World of Liberace is the life of Mr. Showmanship the way he wanted his fans to see it.  Liberace walks you through his houses, costumes, cars, antiques, and dogs all the while acknowledging subtly how ridiculous it all can be.  He has fun with it all and wants you to share in it.",1390262400,2,294,4.327272727272727
8514672,5,B007CQ7L7U,Liberace was an amazing entertainer!!! Larger than life showmanship with costumes and the flair to never be repeated! His piano skills are fantastic to listen to even if the rest is too over the top for you,1372204800,4,206,4.594594594594595
