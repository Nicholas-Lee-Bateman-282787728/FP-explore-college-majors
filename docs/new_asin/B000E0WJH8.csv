Probably because I'm an animation nerd, I really admire the ""film"" qualities it has; it's the one Fairytopia that really manages to pull music, story, and animation together into a cohesive thing.  The acting, the writing, the timing, the shooting, the music--it just fits together so well.

On the outside (i.e. the designs/animation) is is adorable, bright colored, and pretty.

While the message of the film (overall) may be self-sacrifice and teamwork, I really have trouble seeing that.
The two main characters fight with each other...a lot.  They are extremely catty in their remarks and base their dislike for each other on their mutual interest in a boy.  Nori, the commonere Mermaid is in love with the Prince, but she thinks said prince loves Elina and vice versa.  Thus, she uses this as an excuse to be, frankly, a real bitch for the remainder of the film.

Mermaidia is about this:A sea butterfly comes to Elina(Barbie) and tells her Nalu needs help. Elina goes to help and finds a mermaid named Nori that is one of Nalu`s friends and also onew of his secret admirers. Nori and Elina end up becoming freiends after rescuing Nalu and the Immunity Berry. There is this potion that the Fungi(pronounced Fun-Guy)has that will kill Mermaidia if Prince Nalu does`nt give Laverna and the Fungi the Imunnity Berry. But Elina can`t remain a mermaid forever since she has a specail necklace and If she does`nt get the Immunity Berry in time,she will remain a mermaid forever. So Elina must get to the top of the waterfall before the Last Pearl turns white and it`s about to when the Fungi throw the potion back into the water and Elina jumps back into the water and saves Mermaidia. But Her Last Pearl turns white and she will remain a mermaid forever.

Or So she thought.

Well,I won`t spoil the ending for you.

2478671,3,B000E0WJH8,"I should have known when I saw this was a follow on from Fairytopia that I would be disappointed. This is the story of Elina, who in the movie Fairytopia saved her country of Fairytopia and gained her wings. In this she is sent an urgent message from the Prince of Mermaidia (who briefly appeared in Fairytopia) who asks for her to help him. The movie is full of the trials and tribulations she goes through for him, along with his girlfriend Nori. I expect it is deliberate they have named the Mermaid heroine after Japanese Edible seaweed but it seems ill-considered.

Anyway - the good things about the movie, it is brightly coloured, and the costumes for the characters are gorgeous, when Elina becomes a mermaid she looks just stunning. There are really nice messages in this - about overcoming jealousy, selflessness, sharing and the power of team work. Some of these messages are laid on with a trowel, but on the other hand it is for young children and I think the message needs to be strong. And lets get real here, the movies aren't aimed at adults. However I thinksome of hte best movies are those that can easily be watched by Adults and children together - and the best Barbie movie (I think) was Princess and the Pauper where I still find it easy to sit down with my kids and watch it. I wish Barbie movies would get back to that sort of good, singing fun.

the things I found difficult is that although there was a strong basic story (getting the immunity berry) the whole thing was quite confusing for my under 5 year olds. There is so much going on that they quickly lost track of what was happening and who was who. There were too many characters and they all seemed to have marketing tie-ins - lots of mer-ferry's, snails, mermaids, turtles, dolphins - the list went on and on. The overall story which seemed to start it all seemed a weak concept from the start. Some of the characters faces were too animated. In the early Barbie movies there still seemed to be a semblance of reality, but the merferries and so on did seem oddly characterised, almost like Japanese Anime. Perhaps it is something children like, but I prefer the traditional animation, certainly the mix of the two was unsettling at times. Lastly, there is a moment when Elina and Nori get marks of courage which look like tatoos - call me conservative, but I don't want my under 5 year old even thinking a tatoo is cool - no matter what form it takes.

There were some genuinely good moments in this film and despite its faults my children have watched it a couple of times, but it doesn't really interest them in the way that the early dancing ones (swan lake for instance or Princess and the Pauper) I really hope the next movie planned is one of these sort.",1152144000,50,2747,4.468127490039841
2478672,5,B000E0WJH8,"We own all the Barbie movies and I have to say this is the best one yet. If your little one is scared of a ""bad guy"", then don't worry. The ""bad person"" in this movie is on a cell phone across the other part of the world. Not very threatening. But the mermaids still have a big challenge and that is what makes it nice for little girls. Plus, they get to see girls working together for a great cause. Nice teamwork theme! Special effects are great. This is the best Barbie movie yet! Buy this one and the Fairytopia movie for your little girl. She will love you for it!",1151280000,2,569,4.089285714285714
2478673,5,B000E0WJH8,"While I enjoy classic fairytales and my daughter likes them too, I was thrilled that Mattel made this movie about strong women who do not need to be saved by ""Prince Charming.""  More and more movies are being made like this and I am thrilled.  Not only do the women save the day, but it also gives a good moral message about teaming up with others and not always trying to do things by yourself.  In the end, Elina learns that her 'real' self is just right, even if (possibly) she won't get her wings back.  I really liked it!",1147996800,3,526,4.23

The real star of the movie for my 11 year old son and 3 year old daughter is Bibble.  Hilarious.  My son normally would not be caught dead watching a Barbie movie but he'll sit through any scene with Bibble in it.  My 3 year old will bring me the movie, ""Mommy, I wanna watch Bibble.""  Overall, this is a good movie for girls and boys alike.",1146441600,12,443,4.1647058823529415

Id be happy to buy her a couple mermaids for the bathtub, but they don't make one of Nalu the MerPrince. The whole point of this movie is that they are going to rescue him. What's the point of buying Elina and/or Nori when there is no one to rescue? Atleast the girls are rescuing the boys for once. ;-)",1146182400,6,470,4.233333333333333

Then she went into detail about the story. When I saw it (I was expecting a cheap, thrown together film just to move product) I was impressed with the underwater movements. It had a very relaxing effect. Some children's movies we watch bother me to see again because I could hardly stand them the first time. We rented it first and now I'm buying it. Both my 6 yr old and 3 yr old ask for it first thing when we get home each day.",1145664000,12,597,3.9833333333333334

She has to decide what is more important keeping her wings or saving her friend.  Well you should know what she decides, but all turns out great in the end.",1144713600,7,323,4.079365079365079

Thankgod its not a ""dark"" barbie movie, because some like pegasus are on the gloomy side. but this one is not! the story is very nice and its not scary for little kids to watch, which concerns me since my 5yr. old is a little sensitive to certain cartoons.
