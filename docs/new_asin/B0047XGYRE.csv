4285600,4,B0047XGYRE,"Smart, moderately budgeted half-hour crime series set in Coronado, CA, near San Diego, starring Rod Cameron as private detective Dan Adams. Shot by Revue/MCA in 1959-60 for syndication in 1960-61, Coronado 9 moves briskly, with direct, uncluttered plots and surprisingly biting violence. Prints for this welcome DVD release are unrestored but pleasingly clean, with adequate gray ranges and clear audio. Cameron, rugged at about 50 and very tall, is alternately amiable and grimly determined as Adams, a believable character who takes plenty of lumps before emerging triumphant. Cameron was a stuntman before reaching B-movie stardom via serials and westerns. He had a long and prolific career, and Coronado 9 is a highlight. William Witney, who had directed Cameron in the actor's 1943 breakthrough, G Men vs. Black Dragon, helmed many episodes of Coronado 9, bringing more visual flair and action than was typical of crime shows of the period; stunts are particularly well-staged. Plots are suitably varied (robbery, extortion, murder, domestic upset, psychosis, etc.), and the city-seaside combination is used well in location shooting. Male guests stars are competent types like John Archer, Ed Kemmer, Harry Lauter, Walter Reed, Anthony Caruso, Richard Arlen, and young Doug McClure. Female guests stars are particularly vivid: Beverly Garland, Joanne Linville, Sue Ane Langdon, Laurie Mitchell, Coleen Gray, Carol Ohmart, Lisa Lu, Connie Hines, Jean Willes. The episodes are uniformly entertaining, with the strongest being the work of writer Lawrence Kimble (Shotgun Slade, 77 Sunset Strip, Cameron's State Trooper, and many others). But Rod Cameron--stolid and appealing--is the single most important reason why Coronado 9 is satisfying and above average. And despite what the brief liner notes suggest, ""Coronado 9"" doesn't refer to a telephone exchange, but to the main character's home address.",1298160000,67,1905,5.595155709342561

4285611,5,B0047XGYRE,"Coronado 9 is a fantastic detective series from the early 1960's. I was too small to watch Coronado 9 when it originally aired and only discovered it after watching the State Trooper series with Rod Cameron (another really great series). The stories on Coronado 9 are well written and the acting is top notch. This is not a wimpy detective series, it has a number of gun battles,car chases and suspenseful moments. Give this series a try if you like good detective TV.",1360886400,7,468,4.650602409638554
4285612,4,B0047XGYRE,"This show was obviously developed to capitalize on the popularity of Rod Cameron's previous series and was made by the same studio, Revue. Same format, too: black-and-white half hours with voiceover narration to transition between scenes. There is much more talk and less action than in ""State Trooper"". Perhaps the producers thought the public was ready for a bit more sophistication by the end of the 1950s. The show does, however, demonstrate that Rod Cameron was a very good actor. It's certainly a creature of its time: no man goes anywhere without a necktie and all the women seem to be wearing girdles. Production techniques of the time (rear projections, etc.) may be too ""fakey"" for modern viewers, but they bring back childhood memories of hours spent in front of the black-and-white picture tube in the living room. Surprisingly, some scenes were actually shot in foreign locales instead of relying exclusively on stock footage, unusual for a TV show of that era. Source material prints for the DVD are clear and sharp and the sound is good for the most part. I wouldn't rate this show a ""must-have"", but it's enjoyable, nevertheless.",1354665600,4,1145,4.96875
4285613,5,B0047XGYRE,"Rod Cameron, It only takes a real man 1/2 hour to rap things up.  He does it by rappin' the bad guy right in the face.  Oh Yeah!  You'll like it!",1348099200,5,145,3.6129032258064515
4285614,5,B0047XGYRE,"I have not seen all the episodes yet, but those I have watched are of a great quality.  The older shows are very good and presented decent story lines without the need for all sorts of CGI or special effects. I am glad I have this set and will definitel finish it.  I recommend it for everyone",1329264000,4,293,4.12280701754386
4285615,5,B0047XGYRE,I love the old series shot in the States very much. I intend going to Coronado since watching this series. Does anybody know the location of the house on the seafront that Rod lived in in this series? Is it still there?,1326412800,4,219,4.238095238095238
4285616,4,B0047XGYRE,For the cost this series is very entertaining and i really enjoyed the first ten episodes. Rod Cameron is an actor i have seen as a guest star in shows like Laramie and other westerns. He is very good as detective Dan Adams and it was fun to see a very young Doug McClure in the first show. Kudos to Timeless Media for bringing us so many westerns and drama programs that aired on NBC in the 1950's and 60's. Sometimes the quality of the dvds is not the best but these shows are 50 years old.,1325980800,4,492,4.082474226804123
4285617,5,B0047XGYRE,"I am enjoying State Trooper starring Rod Cameron but I have to say this is even more fun. This guy is relatively new to me as an actor but he sure is growing on me fast! There are some real gems of half hour television out there among these old shows and I highly suggest that anyone out there that likes film noir kinda stuff should get their paws on this stuff before it disappears. If you like this,do not fail to check out Lee Marvin in M Squad too. Excuse the cliche but they just don't make tv like this anymore. My dad when he was around used to tell me so, and sadly Ive only recently found out that he had been right. Keep Burn Notice, Johnny Staccato anyone?",1316304000,13,668,4.106870229007634
4285618,5,B0047XGYRE,"This is a great black and white detective show from the early days of TV known as TV's golden era. Rod Cameron does a great job as tough private eye Dan Adams who always solves the case. OK, this is a low budget series and it shows but the scripts are good and the acting is fabulous with plenty of guest stars. There is an occasional goof such the episode where Adams climbs aboard a four engine propeller airliner. When the plane is in the air, you can see that it is now a Boeing 707 jetliner. And you can easily see that the exotic locations in the series was actually shot on a Hollywood back lot with stock film footage used of an airliner landing in the city centered in the episode. Still, this is classic TV and all is forgiven. And there is a feeling of nostalgia to see all those big gas guzzling cars in the series-especially the convertible Dan Adams drives. And, I got a real kick out of Adams always asking people where the nearest telephone was. In those days, there were no cell phones or even computers. I'm giving this series thumbs up with 5 stars *****. And I found it at Sam's Club for only $12.88!!",1315180800,15,1121,4.267605633802817
4285619,4,B0047XGYRE,"If you like State Trooper, you will like this one as well. Coronado 9 is the address of a private detective. Each episode is
30 minutes. We enjoyed watching this product.",1308096000,8,170,4.516129032258065
4285620,5,B0047XGYRE,"Rod Cameron stars as private eye Dan Adams in Coronado 9 (1960-61), a tough, violent, hard hitting half hour crime drama that ran for just a single season, and produced a whopping 39 episodes.  An ex-Navy intelligence officer, operating out of his home at the beach in Coronado, California, Adams gets involved in a variety of cases where murder and death are routine.  With only about 25 minutes to work with, the pace is brisk, and often explores the darker side of humanity.  The stories featured in Coronado 9 are generally well-written, and often include unexpected violence, wicked twists, brutality, and greed.  There is a high body count, and several kills per episode is not uncommon.  Things are seldom as simple as they may appear.  In addition to investigating the nefarious activities around San Diego, Adams' work occasionally takes him to New Orleans, and other places in the USA.  He also tackles jobs in Mexico, and in many other foreign lands, as well as on the high seas.

Dan Adams takes a methodical approach to detective work, and uses street smarts and his connections with law enforcement, to help him find the truth.  Adams hits the pavement doing the legwork, and tracking down leads.  When someone gets in his way or threatens him, Adams usually gets violent.  A big man, Adams isn't flashy or cool with the ladies, but he is tough, and has the determination to see things through.  Adams can be a little gruff dealing with people, but he is mostly ethical, and not motivated just by the buck.

The stories have a particular tone and style, with an atmosphere heavy with intrigue and deceit.  After watching a few episodes, you may begin to question everyone's motives, and be on the lookout for a possible double-cross, surprise twist, or sudden death.  Although some of the situations may be clichd, the writing mostly manages to maintain some level of credibility, seldom becoming too ridiculous.  Adams does seem to employ his pet move of rolling on the ground and then firing a shot rather frequently though.  Coronado 9 is very entertaining and keeps you on your toes, but seldom concludes leaving you feeling warm and fuzzy.  Adams generally kills only in self defense, but he's no saint, and he has no problem with taking the law into his own hands, or bending the truth, in order to save his own hide.

The program features a nice selection of guest stars from the time, with some making multiple appearances.  Connie Hines probably most well-known for playing Carol Post on the TV show Mr. Ed, appears twice, both times as a less than admirable character.  Others featured on the show include Joanne Linville, DeForrest Kelly, Kathie Browne, Beverly Garland, David White, Lisa Lu, Patricia Medina, Anthony Caruso, Sue Ane Langdon, Vaughn Taylor, Mary LaRoche, Slim Pickens, Tracey Roberts, Doug McClure, Barbara Stuart, Vito Scotti, and Virginia Christine.  Rod Cameron had a solid movie career, before coming to television.  He starred in the series City Detective (1953-55) and State Trooper (1956-59), prior to Coronado 9.

Image and sound quality is very good for a program of this age, as Timeless Media Group once again delivers a high quality package.  All 39 episodes are contained on four discs.  Unfortunately there are no bonus materials, and the episodes have no subtitles or chapter stops.  If gritty 60's crime dramas are your thing, you will probably enjoy this series, which was a five star buy on sale at $12.99, with over 15 hours of very entertaining programming.",1306713600,24,3519,4.910321489001692

8418429,4,B0047XGYRE,"Never heard of this show...decided to get it being a fan of old tv. So glad we are getting many DVD releases of these obscure, 1 or 2 season shows.  This one is similar in style/format to State Trooer...another Revue show from a few years prior. Prints and transfers are surprisingly sharp and appear to be from rather decent 16mm uncut sources. Great for old show nostalgia!",1477612800,3,375,4.597014925373134

8418433,4,B0047XGYRE,"There's a quality in today's television shows that lack the panache of classic television! This one season syndicated series starring Rod Cameron (State Trooper/Ciy Detective) is an excellent crime/private detective series. The plots are well written and the actors all give their very best! Better yet, the shows run about 25 mins and do a great job at keeping the audience entertained!
I am glad that I discovered this little gem! Recommended!",1438214400,,445,5.194444444444445
8418434,5,B0047XGYRE,"The plots are pretty predictable and there is at least one killing in just about every show, but I enjoyed watching the episodes. Just watching to see how our hero Dan Adams solves the case and neutralizes the bad guys (and a fair number of bad gals) made the series worth the investment. It doesn't have the current culture's violence and over-rated trashy sex scenes, which is why I ordered it.
It is also very interesting to see how many times the star gets shot, beaten up and knocked unconscious, but then the good guys always seemed to take those things in stride in the 'good old days' of black and white TV.
Buy it, watch it, and predict who all the bad guys/gals are before the last eight minutes or so in each episode just to see how many times you have already solved the case before Dan gets the criminals brought to justice.",1432684800,4,837,4.406451612903226
