6332539,5,B00J3V8YBE,I love seane corn. Her attention to correct alignment makes such a difference in every pose.,1405900800,,92,4.8125
6332540,2,B00J3V8YBE,"The yoga in this DVD is excellent and classic Seane Corn.  However, there is just too much talking and philosophizing for my taste.  I think about picking up the DVD and doing it at home when I want a good practice and then I change my mind and choose something else because there is just too much talking and philosophizing over the long hold poses, particularly at the end of the advanced practice.  Seane even talks all through savasana.  I just cannot relax with her constant talking.  Some pointers and spiritual thoughts are good, but in this DVD she goes overboard in my opinion.",1405555200,28,586,4.596153846153846
6332541,5,B00J3V8YBE,Brilliant as always. Had the chance to take a workshop in Chicago with her. Excellent review tool,1405555200,,97,4.764705882352941
6332542,5,B00J3V8YBE,"As always Ms. Seane delivers. Excellent, I highly recommend this DVD, can't wait for the others that follow!  Thank you for such a mindfully deep practice.",1402012800,9,155,4.961538461538462
6332543,5,B00J3V8YBE,"Much of this offering explains on a deep level the mystery of yoga.  It helped me personally to deeply understand the integral process of the practice of yoga.  Yoga, when practiced more deeply connects us all with the somatic bodily experience, the vulnerable emotional energetic experience and captures how yoga marries with the beautiful union of divinity within us all. This deep, all encompassing expression of yoga, in my humble opinion is the grace and open way of being that we all need when we are on and off of our mats. The beauty of allowing ourselves to vulnerably transform and open to grace which ultimately sets us free from any kind of pain we all experience on this journey of life here on Earth. I am very thankful for this offering and will tell all I know and care for about it.  Blessings, Erin",1399248000,29,816,4.613793103448276
6332544,4,B00J3V8YBE,Easy to follow and a lot of good information,1455753600,,44,4.0
6332545,5,B00J3V8YBE,If you haven't done yoga with seane just buy this- you won't be disappointed...it's like inner healing and chakra work at the same time...I like her as a person and recommend any of her DVDs but this one has a lot of education that is really helpful!,1443225600,,250,4.340425531914893
6332546,5,B00J3V8YBE,It was deliver on time. The video is wonderful!,1439856000,,47,4.333333333333333
6332547,2,B00J3V8YBE,Too much talking and not enough working out.,1438128000,,44,4.625
6332548,5,B00J3V8YBE,"5 stars all the way! This ""Body Mind Flow"" practice and Seane's explanation of the mind/body connection have changed the way I approach both practicing and teaching yoga. This is by far one of the best Yoga DVD's out there and great for all levels!",1428537600,3,248,4.533333333333333
6332549,5,B00J3V8YBE,Excellent DVD for students and especially teachers.,1427155200,,51,6.428571428571429
6332550,2,B00J3V8YBE,"Two stars, not one, because the work out is a good one--challenging, and the advanced session will make your muscles shake.  However, I'd give one star for Seane Corn's constant talking and need to share her knowledge.  She basically never stops, and much of it is yoga gibberish.  That's fine if you are in need of therapy for pent-up anger, frustration, grief, but annoying if you don't.  Ironically she instructs you to ""let go,"" ""take note of your thoughts"" but how can you when she is constantly filling your head with HER ""thoughts""?  You get the feeling that she believes her thoughts are more important than yours. Re-sold mine after one full workout.  She would have done everyone a favor if one cd was for interviews and the other for yoga, and realize that silence is not a wasted opportunity for words, especially while practicing yoga.",1426032000,9,848,4.773972602739726
6332551,5,B00J3V8YBE,I love this series! Both part 1 (this) and 2 are amazing. I do a section everyday and feel amazing because of it. I am eagerly awaiting part 3! HIGHLY recommend!!,1425254400,,162,4.258064516129032
6332552,5,B00J3V8YBE,Fabulous and challenging Yoga!  intermediate level,1424995200,,50,7.333333333333333
6332553,5,B00J3V8YBE,"This is one of those yoga dvd's that I'm stunned doesn't have 1,500 positive reviews.  As far as I'm concerned, it is astonishing in
it's scope.  Beautifully put together, more actual information about yoga itself than I expected - and for
which I'm very grateful.  I have a number of yoga tapes (including the amazing Rod Stryker) and Seane Corn's is now at the very
top of my list.  Learning a lot from this set.",1419811200,5,414,4.48
6332554,5,B00J3V8YBE,"I have many of yoga videos, but Sean's videos are the best I own. I hope she comes out with a PM practice or easy relaxation video at some point.

She has a talent for instructional yoga in video. I never have to look at the screen with her videos. Her instructions are impeccable and her voice doesn't bother me at all. Yes, she has a firm way of speaking, but it's the voice of someone who's passionate about what she's teaching and you can tell she believes what she's saying and that she believes in herself. I imagine making these videos is very difficult. Instruction takes a lot of thought about the viewers and you've got to have the realization that every tiny nuance must be mentioned for those practicing at home.

I'm eagerly waiting for the release of her next video. I've learned so much from her and appreciate her strength and teaching style. If you're serious about yoga and the benefits, both spiritual and physical, you won't be disappointed.",1418428800,7,961,4.5813953488372094
6332555,5,B00J3V8YBE,simply breathtaking. A beautiful flower unfolding.,1417824000,,50,7.5
6332556,5,B00J3V8YBE,This dvd is just amazing - love the way Seane talks you through the breathing and how to move through the poses.  Looking forward to moving along with the dvd and becoming more limber and open.,1415750400,6,193,4.361111111111111
6332557,2,B00J3V8YBE,"I was so moved by Seane Corne's words of wisdom and compassion on recent the Awake In The World webcast that I had to buy this video.  I was looking forward to a yoga program that would be help me to be more aware of my body as well as developing strength and flexibility.  Unfortunately, I think this video could have benefitted from an Absolute Beginners workout (perhaps modified poses, and at a slower pace) as I really have little yoga experience, so found many of the poses too difficult and therefore struggled through rather than enjoying the whole experience.  I hope Seane will consider producing such a video as I really would like yoga to be part of my regular spiritual and health routine.",1414022400,11,702,4.6
6332558,5,B00J3V8YBE,Love Sean amazing,1411430400,,17,5.0

6332560,5,B00J3V8YBE,Amazing,1409788800,,7,7.0
6332561,5,B00J3V8YBE,"You really benefit to watch the commentaries before doing the DVD for the first time.  After hearing Seane's suggestions for breathing, I went on to do the 1-hour yoga session on DVD #1 and had the best yoga workout of my life; I breathed through difficult poses more easily than any other yoga session before.  It opened me up.",1408492800,20,328,4.5423728813559325
6332562,5,B00J3V8YBE,she is so good!!!! I love her and what she stands for.  She is real and natural!,1408147200,,80,3.7058823529411766

8647790,5,B00J3V8YBE,"Love the spiritual focus. It's challenging, but doable for someone who has been away from a daily practice for more than a year due to some health challenges.",1514419200,,158,4.678571428571429
8647791,5,B00J3V8YBE,I love Seane Corn. What an inspirational yoga instructor. Mind and body workout,1493251200,,79,5.153846153846154
8647792,5,B00J3V8YBE,Love this series,1491350400,,16,4.666666666666667
8647793,2,B00J3V8YBE,I am sooo glad I got this dvd from the library instead of buying it. She seems to have a very high strung frazzled energy. She talks a mile a minute. It made me tense to watch her. I wanted to tell her to slow down and take a breath. This is not what I expect from a yoga workout. I like more of a Rodney Yee style demeanor.,1487462400,,324,3.710144927536232
8647794,5,B00J3V8YBE,Great dvds,1486944000,,10,4.5

8647796,5,B00J3V8YBE,"Ahh... I love and love and love this program, Body Mind Flow. This is the first series of Yoga of Awakening and the practice slowly prepares you to build strength of the body. I love Seane's sequence, precise instruction as well as the soothing music. She talks the spiritual connection with God through the practice and I really like it. This might not be for everybody but if you'd cherish your internal bond between you and the unknown, I bet that you will love Seane's Yoga of Awakening series. There are two dvds in this program ; the first dvd is for all levels and the second one is for advanced practice. I have been doing the advanced version for three months every single morning. I love it so much and I don't want to miss it. I have found that my attitude is much much calmer and forgiving towards myself as well as others when I do the practice and I can tell that this Seane's practice brings you peace. Thank you Seane and I love you.",1477353600,4,949,4.337078651685394
8647797,5,B00J3V8YBE,Such a nice format with all aspects of the practice discussed.  The yoga is solid and a nice straight forward flow.,1459728000,,115,4.476190476190476
