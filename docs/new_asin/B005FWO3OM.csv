4686417,5,B005FWO3OM,"Why would anyone not want any Austin matches from WCW? His run with Pillman as the Hollywood Blondes was fantastic as well as his matches with Steamboat, the Horsemen, and not to mention probably the greatest War Games ever with the Dangerous Alliance vs. The Horsemen. Anyone who could say that obviously can't appreciate how great he was in WCW. It's not his fault WCW dropped the ball on him as well as several other great wrestlers like Jericho, Bret Hart, Guerrero, Beniot, Malenko, etc. As, far as his WWF/E run they need to put Austin/Angle from Summerslam 2001 on here it's one of my all time favorite Austin matches and has yet to be on any of the comp dvds as far as I know. I really hope we get a decent amount of Austin's 2001 heel run because he was so good but not much of it has made it to dvd. BTW if there is any match Austin should come back for it should be Austin/Punk. The script writes itself plus their twitter exchanges have been hilarious.",1315612800,4,964,4.361111111111111

4686433,5,B005FWO3OM,"Simply put; if you are a Stone Cold Steve Austin fan then you have to have this set.  Besides a top notch documentary about his career, with highlights and some pretty low lowlights, you get some of his most iconic matches with Bret Hart, The Rock, Undertaker, and more.  Even the match that lit the fuse on the Attitude Era, King of the Ring against Jake the Snake Roberts, as well as his last match at Wrestlemania with The Rock.
One of my favorite sections is all the great promos, interviews, vignettes, and even stuff that went on after the tv broadcast was over but the fans were still there.  One of our family's favorite moments ever was the bedpan shot when Vince was in the hospital with his ""bruised ankle"".  And it's still just as hilarious now as it was then!  I know that ""never a dull moment"" is overused but it's absolutely true here.
And that's the bottom line 'cause Stone Cold says so!",1439856000,,904,4.421686746987952
4686434,5,B005FWO3OM,"If you're a fan it's a must buy. The 1st disc for me is a highlight as it is a documentary on Stone Cold Steve Austin and is brilliantly done. You'll learn a whole lot more about the life of Steve Williams aka Stone Cold Steve Austin. It is very entertaining with some hilarious promos and vignettes but there is also a sad part when his wrestling career was winding down due to injury. They also touch on his acting career. That disc alone is worth the purchase but the matches on the other discs are classics and although I've seen most of them before they never seem to die. A great addition to any wrestling fans library, especially a Stone Cold fan. WHAT!",1436745600,2,660,4.330645161290323

It covers a wide territory of Stone Cold's career but the biggest focus is of course his rise during the Attitude Era.

There's a nice selection of matches along with promo's but the thing I really liked was the alternate commentary with Stone Cold and Jim Ross. They worked well together and gave some insightful comments about past opponents. Picture quality is excellent. And this is one of the few 3-discs Blu-ray sets from WWE(with a great price of just under ten bucks on Amazon at the date of this review).",1417737600,,676,4.495934959349594

4686453,5,B005FWO3OM,"This is one of those cases where I can try to come up with a bunch of phrases & words to describe him but there's nothing I can honestly say that would do justice to ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin past the name of this DVD in that he's ""The Most Popular Superstar Of All Time!"" This is the most recent of many videos (VHS & DVD sets) made on Austin but after the lukewarm response to his previous ""Legacy"" set, Austin was personally involved in this set from the documentary to picking out the extras including this being the first documentary that completely covers his entire career from start to finish. Your hear new comments from Austin himself throughout the documentary along with others involved in his career including Mick Foley, Dutch Mantell, Percy Pringle (Paul Bearer), Jim Ross, Arn Anderson, Paul Heyman, Triple H, William Regal, Chris Jericho, Joey Styles, Vince McMahon, Pat Patterson, Gerald Brisco, Michael Hayes, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Christian, C.M. Punk, John Cena, The Miz, Jerry Lawler, The Rock, ""The Condemned"" co-star Vinnie Jones & director Scott Wiper, Bill Demont, John Morrison, and Tough Enough Winner Andy Leveane.

The documentary beings with Austin talking about growing up & how he discovered wrestling & became a fan to the point where he went to live events through college before eventually going into Chris Adams' wrestling school & his time in the USWA telling the story of how he got the name ""Stunning Steve Austin"" & how he ended up in a ""teacher vs. student"" feud with Chris Adams. His time in WCW was discussed next including his reaction to his first ring introduction, the importance of the WCW Television Championship, the rise & fall of the Hollywood Blondes, his feud with Ricky Steamboat, and how things started to go downhill eventually leading to getting fired. How Paul Heyman found out Steve got fired began to cover his time in ECW with the main point being how he had a platform to vent about his frustrations which led to his famous promos which would end up being the first look at the Stone Cold character. His early days in WWE were talked about next starting from the problems with ""The Ringmaster"" gimmick, how he came up with the name & character of ""Stone Cold"" along with the development of it leading up to the King Of The Ring & where ""Austin 3:16"" came from, and his feud with Bret Hart leading up to the infamous double switch at WrestleMania 13. SummerSlam '97 was heavily discussed next with the piledriver Owen gave Austin with Austin's thoughts while it was happening & Bret talking about how it changed the relationship between those two before going into how him being injured allowed him to showcase his personality as a character & on the mic while pushing the envelope with his language & middle fingers along with the impact of his stunner on Vince at Madison Square Garden. The road to Austin's WWE Championship reign was highlighted next featuring the involvement of Mike Tyson along with the media coverage it brought leading to Austin's crossover ability appearing on various TV shows. His war against Vince McMahon was discussed next such as the importance of ""The Stooges"" & remembering various incidents between the two that included various motor vehicles & the infamous steel bedpan before talking about his WrestleMania XV match with The Rock & the personal issues Austin had to overcome going into the match that was noticeable from the start with Austin wearing a t-shirt to the ring instead of his trademark vest. A huge highlight of this presentation came next with Austin discussing his issues with his neck causing him to take the time off & doing into details of his surgery such as who was there when he woke up from his surgery & how Austin wasn't sure if he was going to come back from it & his fear of how the fans would respond to him. Another big step in Austin's career was discussed next in regards to his heel turn at WrestleMania X-7 & what he would change about that night knowing what he knows now, how he expanded his character with the comedy skits with Kurt Angle & Vince, and the story behind where the ""What?"" came from. Everything that led to Austin's walkout in 2002 was discussed next from his issues going into WrestleMania & what was planned for RAW the night he went home followed by the story of his return in 2003 leading to WrestleMania XIX against The Rock with Austin's health issues the day before & the aftermath of the match that Austin himself got very emotional when talking about it. Austin's run as co-General Manager & the Sheriff of RAW, his interaction with the fans after the show, his involvement in the movie ""The Condemned"" & hosting Tough Enough, his Hall Of Fame induction, and reflections on Austin round out the documentary.

DVD extras include bonus stories from Austin about him giving out autographs before he even started training, possibly joining the Hair Club For Men, where his ""Rattlesnake"" nickname came from, Triple H telling a funny story behind an incident at SummerSlam '99, C.M. Punk talking about the first times he met Austin, a music video, various people telling their memories of the Stone Cold Stunner with Austin revealing who told him about the move, and an entire disc of promos & moments. Bonus stories on the Blu-Ray include Austin talking about his memories of the Sportatorium & the story behind his first t-shirt (along with what Undertaker had to do with it). Other Blu-Ray extras include bonus matches, Austin answering questions asked by his Twitter followers, a tour of the ""Broken Skull Ranch"", his Hall Of Fame induction & appearance at WrestleMania the next night, and extra promos & moments.

Matches Include:
vs. Gentleman Chris Adams - This match was a pretty short brawl that was pretty much about how Austin had to keep depending on his valet Jeannie (Austin's real life wife & Adams' ex) to help him get an advantage.
""USWA"" May '90

w/Ric Flair vs. Sting & Ricky Steamboat - Both teams just worked together perfectly as if they were long term teams with Austin & Flair using anything to their advantage as heels with Sherri getting involved along with double teaming whenever possible. The action got out of control at one point where the announcers & even the referee was confused on who is the legal man. There was fighting in & out of the ring along with the action being very fast paced in a main event quality match on free television.
""WCW Saturday Night"" July '94

vs. Jake Roberts - This was the final match of the annual King Of The Ring tournament with Jake going into the match with ribs that were heavily injured by Vader earlier in the night while Austin's lip was patched up from being busted open earlier in the night. Austin was completely ruthless here & the perfect heel against Jake who refused to quit & was after his own ""Cinderella"" story as Austin kept focusing on Jake's ribs. When all was said & done, Austin 3:16 was born.

Submission Match w/Ken Shamrock as the referee vs. Bret Hart - Just knowing how physical & intense this feud was for the previous months, you got exactly what you expected here in that this was just an all out brawl that went from in the ring to ringside & through the crowd with these men using anything they can get their hands on (ringpost & guardrail & steel steps & ringbell & cables) to just beat the living hell out of each other to the point where Austin was heavily bleeding. Bret Hart did try to focus on Austin's knee with moves like the figure four on the post while other submissions were tried like a combination of a arm bar & head scissors, and boston crab. This match is a classic & memorable for so many things such as it launched Austin that launched Austin from a superstar to a main event talent, the beginning of the most unique heel turn in wrestling history with Bret Hart, and the highlight image of Austin fighting out of the Sharpshooter with the blood just pouring down from his face.

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rocky Maivia - This was a glorified handicap match were as it was the Rocky & the Nation Of Domination vs. Stone Cold & his pickup truck. This match was so out of control to the point where even the referee got knocked out at one point & Austin wasn't able to take his vest off until the match was over.
""In Your House: DeGeneration X"" Dec. '97
[History Of The Intercontinental Championship]

vs. WWE Champion Shawn Michaels - Mike Tyson was the special outside enforcer for this match but already had his issues with Austin leading to him joining Shawn's group of D-Generation X weeks earlier while it should also be noted that Shawn Michaels came out to the DX band performing him to the ring while Shawn had been nursing a back injury that caused him to be out of action since the Royal Rumble in January. Shawn kept throwing jabs early causing Austin to retaliate with a clothesline & punches while making an ass out of Shawn. Triple H & Chyna got involved causing them to be sent to the back while Austin & HBK brawled from the ring to the stage to ringside with Austin backdropped over the railing at one point. Shawn remained in control working over Austin's legs while continued to taunt him. The big moment came with the referee being knocked out before Austin caught Sweet Chin Music into a stunner causing Tyson to get involved how nobody expected him to going into the match with Tyson delivering the final ""blow"" to Shawn Michaels.

(Alternate Commentary By Steve Austin & Jim Ross)

Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Dude Love w/special guest referee Mr. McMahon - Mr. McMahon had the odds heavily stacked against Austin here with himself as the special referee, Gerald Brisco as the time keeper, and Pat Patterson as the ring announcer who refused to even announce Austin but Undertaker volunteered himself to be the special outside enforcer to make sure Vince called the match fairly. This started off as a normal match with Vince already showing his bias by attempting to quick count Austin early which Austin responded to by knocking Dude Love's new false teeth out of his mouth & stomped on them. They took it to the floor with Austin being thrown into the steps with Vince refusing to countout Austin since Dude wasn't able to win the title that way only for Dude to continue to attack Austin on the floor causing Vince to change the match to a ""No Disqualification Match."" Austin was able to recover & clothesline Dude over the guardrail & took out Brisco in the process before both men brawled down the isle leading to the match becoming a ""Falls Count Anywhere Match."" The brawled on the cars setup on the stage including one moment where Austin went for a stunner but shoved off the hood of one car onto the hood of another car causing Austin to bleed. The fought back to the ring with a chair getting involved with Dude executing a double DDT & Austin later knocking out Dude with a chairshot to the head with Vince refusing to count only to later pay for it when Vince himself got knocked out with a chair. Chaos followed resulting in Patterson & Brisco getting involved with Taker making each one of them pay for it. This was one of the craziest main events during this time but definitely quality.

WWE Championship Match vs. Undertaker - This was the conclusion of the months long build between Austin & Undertaker at SummerSlam that was dubbed ""The Highway To Hell"" (complete with the AC/DC song of the same name). Both men came aggressive at each other in the beginning with Austin getting knocked out early in the match due to hit accidentally butting heads with Undertaker. From there, you got all the elements you expected in this match as you had the brawling through the crowd & both men putting on a quality match in the ring with both men pulling out some surprises like Taker doing a legdrop off the top rope onto Austin on the outside announce table while Austin tried doing move wrestling moves like the drop toehold he executed early in the match. A high quality performance from both men here.

[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's]

vs. Big Show - This was right before WrestleMania XV with Mankind as the special referee, The Rock doing commentary, and Vince sitting at ringside. Show had the clear power advantage as he was able to keep counter Austin's attacks & block the stunner numerous times with Show also being was very defiant of Mankind causing him to take matters into his own hands at times as the referee. This match really put Show over as a threat since he had to take numerous non-stop chair shots to the head to finally be put down.

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion The Rock - Austin came out in a t-shirt instead of his usual vest & took the fight to The Rock quickly as they brawled through the crowd to the stage area back to ringside with Austin dropping two elbow drops on Rock through the spanish table. A chair was put into play that caused the referee to accidentally get hit while Rock later used the chair to attack Austin all over his body before another referee was taken out. With Vince McMahon making his way to ringside along with the original special guest referee for this match, this was a match that lived up to the hype.

[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion The Rock - You could feel the tension between both men for weeks & it exploded right from the start when Austin attacked Rock during his entrance with both men blocking each others signature moves early with even Rock attempting Austin's own stunner. Both men brawled on the outside with Austin hit the Rock with the ringbell busting him open right away before they took it back into the ring with them trading momentum as Rock returned the favor to Austin with the ringbell causing him to bleed. Both men pulled out all stops using the ringpost & monitor while both attempted the moves like a sharpshooter, the ""Million $ Dream"" that we hadn't seen in years, and Rock delivering Austin's own stunner. However what this match is most memorable for happened when Vince McMahon appeared & his involvement showing how someone would ""sell their soul"" to become the champion. Jim Ross described this match best on commentary, ""Off The Page Intense!""

(Alternate Commentary By Steve Austin & Jim Ross)

(Blu-Ray) WWE Championship/No Holds Barred Match vs. The Undertaker vs. Triple H - Both Triple H & Undertaker were members of the Corporate Ministry at this time & Triple H started out the match fighting Austin in the isleway before Taker came from behind to assist & used the title on Austin. This was a glorified handicap match as both Taker & Triple H kept working as a team on Austin throughout the match with Austin having to resort to using a chair in order to try to get some momentum in his direction. However things started to turn when Triple H & Taker started to fight over who gets the win (and the championship) causing them to break up each others pin attempts & have it be every man for himself leading to Austin & Triple H working together at one point to take out Taker. The Corporate Ministry got involved while everyone that they had an issue with earlier in the night came out as well leading to absolute chaos including Chyna getting a stunner for her troubles.
No Mercy '99 (U.K. PPV)

(Blu-Ray) vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle - This was Austin's first television appearance since losing the title to Kurt Angle at the previous Unforgiven PPV with WWE Commissioner Regal at ringside to ensure there was no foul play. Both started being very intense & fast paced with both brawling on the floor with Austin's head bouncing off the announce table resorting to him trying to use a chair before Regal took it away. Austin tried to beat Kurt at his own game with various submissions like the boston crab before trying to use the championship belt with Regal once again getting involved taking the title away from Austin...and hitting Angle with it allowing Austin to regain the WWE Championship in what would be Austin's last title reign.
""RAW"" Oct. '01

(Blu-Ray) WWE Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle vs. Rob Van Dam - Kurt Angle walked into this match representing the WWE while Austin was representing the WCW/ECW Alliance but the major wildcard here was Rob Van Dam who also a member of the Alliance with Austin but was recently seen talking with WWE Chairman Vince McMahon & delivered frog splashes to both Austin & Angle in the past week so nobody was sure where his allegiance lied. This was a great triple threat match that had it's moments of two men working together over one guy while it was still every man for himself with one moment where RVD was going for the frog splash but both Austin & Angle moved causing RVD to crash & burn with nobody knowing who he was going to hit. The main story here was the appearance of Vince McMahon at ringside who not only took out his own son Shane at ringside but also delivered a chairshot to Austin that busted him open from the back of his head. This was a fun triple threat match that played into all the stories going into the match.
No Mercy '01

(Blu-Ray) vs. The Rock - These two faced off at WrestleMania for the third time & began trading blows early before brawling in the isleway back to ringside with The Rock thrown into the steps. The Rock targeted Austin's bad legs by clipping them twice & ramming his knee into the announce table & ring post followed by a sharpshooter. Rock started to get more cocky & wore Austin's vest only for it to bring him bad luck with Austin regaining the advantage before both men were able to apply each others finishers on each other before Rock was able to regain control hitting the people's elbow followed by three different Rock Bottom's to finally gain his victory over Austin at WrestleMania...in what we would later find out to be Austin's last match.

[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

In the end, the documentary alone is worth the price of this as we've gotten different documentaries on Austin throughout his career on his DVD sets but this is the most complete one of Austin that not only covers his career from start to finish but also we hear from people who we rarely hear from in these presentations. I have my reservations of the match selection as there are a bunch of repeats on here that we've seen on other sets including Austin's last set but the alternative commentary is a bonus on the WrestleMania matches while Austin made it clear that some of these matches were important to his career which I can't disagree with but I don't see how some selections like the Big Show match is important to the career instead of the Hollywood Blondes winning the tag team titles which still hasn't been released to a DVD to this day. In the end, an Austin fan is going to have this in their collection but for those newer fans just starting out their Austin collection this I would definitely recommend this before anything previous collect & go out of your way to get the Blu-Ray for all the bonus moments & outtakes alone. Although this is suppose to be the last set dedicated to Austin, I can only hope in the future we get another Austin set similar to the one we got for Hulk Hogan in that it's an unreleased/rare match collection as so many Austin matches from his days in WCW, USWA, and WWE that have still yet to see the light of day.",1403568000,,19943,4.6224604966139955

4686479,5,B005FWO3OM,"This is hand's down the best WWE blu ray to date. The first disc contains a 2 1/2 hour bio on Austin's career which was decent but really didn't add anything new towards his legacy although I did find a few interesting things towards the end of his in ring career. You get an additional four matches as well as a few stories. The bonus matches are good but like the other matches in the set, most of it has been seen before. The second dvd starts off with two good unreleased gems and then it's all been there, seen that before matches. While a few are classics in my eyes, they could have picked a few unreleased gems. That was one of WWE's best dvds-Hulk Hogan's Unreleased matches-because it showed matches the public has never seen and it felt fresh. I found the Shawn Michaels match funny because that was early WWE when it would blur anything featuring the scratched WWF logo out and it seemed like everything was blurred in that match. That was my only problem with the set. Disc 3 is mostly all his famous promo's, which is fun to watch. He also answers questions from fans, which last 25 minutes. The whole set has a run time of 10 hours but in reality it's 12 hours, 4 hours per disc. It's epic and worth the money.

Now a plea to the WWE, even if it doesn't do a damn thing. Your fans are males-mostly 18-25 and probably older men buy sets depending on who the superstar is. WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP EDITING OUT THE LANGUAGE?! Austin drops the s word about 20 or so times in the set and it's edited.

4686490,5,B005FWO3OM,"I was a WWF fan, yes a WWF fan. I got out of it when it became WWE and was too PG. When I did watch, Stone Cold was my favorite. Ive been waiting for an awesome biography on him to come out and it's finally here. The documentary about him runs about 2.5 hours and it is awesome! I've held out on getting any of his other dvds, so i don't know how much is repeated but that doesnt matter. It starts from when he was born, all the way too his last match with the Rock, and even what he did after he wasn't actually in the ring anymore (backstage stuff etc). It's very detailed and is an incredible thing to watch. I wish they spent more time on his feud with Vince (all the classic moments are in here though) and the Rock. The Rock made Stone Cold and Stone Cold made the Rock, so I wanted more time spent on them, but overall it was good. The comments from the other wrestlers are really cool to hear; they obviously know Stone Cold was the best, so the respect they convey towards him and everything he did for the business come accross totally heartfelt. If there is a single reason to buy this, it's the main feature documentary. AWESOME!!

I haven't watched all the matches, but they are matches Austin picked himself; his career defining matches. Yes there are ones that people want that are not on here, but its a good collection so far. I would've loved to see Austin's match with Vince at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre where he throws Vince off the cage into the table, but maybe one day well get to see that one. Austin and JR do commentary for 3 of the matches. I wish he did one for all of them, hearing them talk about the matches is great.

The extra features and moments on here are awesome as well. How the stunner was invented/ who took the best (Rock obviously, Austin says so himself) and worst stunners/ other wrestlers favorite stunners. Great thing to watch. The classic moments are on here too (The beer truck etc).

If you were ever a fan of the Stone Cold era of the WWF/WWE, you NEED to buy this blu ray! You will not be disappointed!!! And that's the bottom line.....",1327968000,2,2096,4.2481203007518795

But this is different because He takes you not only from the beginning but all the way to what he's doing now and I really liked that.

The road to Austin's WWE Championship reign was highlighted next featuring the involvement of Mike Tyson along with the media coverage it brought leading to Austin's crossover ability appearing on various TV shows.  His war against Vince McMahon was discussed next such as the importance of ""The Stooges"" & remembering various incidents between the two that included various motor vehicles & the infamous steel bedpan before talking about his WrestleMania XV match with The Rock & the personal issues Austin had to overcome going into the match that was noticeable from the start with Austin wearing a t-shirt to the ring instead of his trademark vest.  A huge highlight of this presentation came next with Austin discussing his issues with his neck causing him to take the time off & doing into details of his surgery such as who was there when he woke up from his surgery & how Austin wasn't sure if he was going to come back from it & his fear of how the fans would respond to him.  Another big step in Austin's career was discussed next in regards to his heel turn at WrestleMania X-7 & what he would change about that night knowing what he knows now, how he expanded his character with the comedy skits with Kurt Angle & Vince, and the story behind where the ""What?"" came from.  Everything that led to Austin's walkout in 2002 was discussed next from his issues going into WrestleMania & what was planned for RAW the night he went home followed by the story of his return in 2003 leading to WrestleMania XIX against The Rock with Austin's health issues the day before & the aftermath of the match that Austin himself got very emotional when talking about it.

Matches Include:
vs. Gentleman Chris Adams - This match was a pretty short brawl that was pretty much about how Austin had to keep depending on his valet Jeannie (Austin's real life wife & Adams' ex) to help him get an advantage.
""USWA"" May '90

w/Ric Flair vs. Sting & Ricky Steamboat - Both teams just worked together perfectly as if they were long term teams with Austin & Flair using anything to their advantage as heels with Sherri getting involved along with double teaming whenever possible.  The action got out of control at one point where the announcers & even the referee was confused on who is the legal man.  There was fighting in & out of the ring along with the action being very fast paced in a main event quality match on free television.
""WCW Saturday Night"" July '94

vs. Jake Roberts - This was the final match of the annual King Of The Ring tournament with Jake going into the match with ribs that were heavily injured by Vader earlier in the night while Austin's lip was patched up from being busted open earlier in the night. Austin was completely ruthless here & the perfect heel against Jake who refused to quit & was after his own ""Cinderella"" story as Austin kept focusing on Jake's ribs.  When all was said & done, Austin 3:16 was born.

Submission Match w/Ken Shamrock as the referee vs. Bret Hart - Just knowing how physical & intense this feud was for the previous months, you got exactly what you expected here in that this was just an all out brawl that went from in the ring to ringside & through the crowd with these men using anything they can get their hands on (ringpost & guardrail & steel steps & ringbell & cables) to just beat the living hell out of each other to the point where Austin was heavily bleeding. Bret Hart did try to focus on Austin's knee with moves like the figure four on the post while other submissions were tried like a combination of a arm bar & head scissors, and boston crab. This match is a classic & memorable for so many things such as it launched Austin that launched Austin from a superstar to a main event talent, the beginning of the most unique heel turn in wrestling history with Bret Hart, and the highlight image of Austin fighting out of the Sharpshooter with the blood just pouring down from his face.

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rocky Maivia - This was a glorified handicap match were as it was the Rocky & the Nation Of Domination vs. Stone Cold & his pickup truck. This match was so out of control to the point where even the referee got knocked out at one point & Austin wasn't able to take his vest off until the match was over.
""In Your House: DeGeneration X"" Dec. '97
[History Of The Intercontinental Championship]

vs. WWE Champion Shawn Michaels - Mike Tyson was the special outside enforcer for this match but already had his issues with Austin leading to him joining Shawn's group of D-Generation X weeks earlier while it should also be noted that Shawn Michaels came out to the DX band performing him to the ring while Shawn had been nursing a back injury that caused him to be out of action since the Royal Rumble in January.  Shawn kept throwing jabs early causing Austin to retaliate with a clothesline & punches while making an ass out of Shawn.  Triple H & Chyna got involved causing them to be sent to the back while Austin & HBK brawled from the ring to the stage to ringside with Austin backdropped over the railing at one point.  Shawn remained in control working over Austin's legs while  continued to taunt him.  The big moment came with the referee being knocked out before Austin caught Sweet Chin Music into a stunner causing Tyson to get involved how nobody expected him to going into the match with Tyson delivering the final ""blow"" to Shawn Michaels.
WrestleMania XIV
[History Of The WWE Championship]
(Alternate Commentary By Steve Austin & Jim Ross)

Falls Count Anywhere Match vs. Dude Love w/special guest referee Mr. McMahon - Mr. McMahon had the odds heavily stacked against Austin here with himself as the special referee, Gerald Brisco as the time keeper, and Pat Patterson as the ring announcer who refused to even announce Austin but Undertaker volunteered himself to be the special outside enforcer to make sure Vince called the match fairly.  This started off as a normal match with Vince already showing his bias by attempting to quick count Austin early which Austin responded to by knocking Dude Love's new false teeth out of his mouth & stomped on them.  They took it to the floor with Austin being thrown into the steps with Vince refusing to countout Austin since Dude wasn't able to win the title that way only for Dude to continue to attack Austin on the floor causing Vince to change the match to a ""No Disqualification Match.""  Austin was able to recover & clothesline Dude over the guardrail & took out Brisco in the process before both men brawled down the isle leading to the match becoming a ""Falls Count Anywhere Match.""  The brawled on the cars setup on the stage including one moment where Austin went for a stunner but shoved off the hood of one car onto the hood of another car causing Austin to bleed.  The fought back to the ring with a chair getting involved with Dude executing a double DDT & Austin later knocking out Dude with a chairshot to the head with Vince refusing to count only to later pay for it when Vince himself got knocked out with a chair.  Chaos followed resulting in Patterson & Brisco getting involved with Taker making each one of them pay for it.  This was one of the craziest main events during this time but definitely quality.

WWE Championship Match vs. Undertaker - This was the conclusion of the months long build between Austin & Undertaker at SummerSlam that was dubbed ""The Highway To Hell"" (complete with the AC/DC song of the same name). Both men came aggressive at each other in the beginning with Austin getting knocked out early in the match due to hit accidentally butting heads with Undertaker. From there, you got all the elements you expected in this match as you had the brawling through the crowd & both men putting on a quality match in the ring with both men pulling out some surprises like Taker doing a legdrop off the top rope onto Austin on the outside announce table while Austin tried doing move wrestling moves like the drop toehold he executed early in the match. A high quality performance from both men here.

vs. Big Show - This was right before WrestleMania XV with Mankind as the special referee, The Rock doing commentary, and Vince sitting at ringside. Show had the clear power advantage as he was able to keep counter Austin's attacks & block the stunner numerous times with Show also being was very defiant of Mankind causing him to take matters into his own hands at times as the referee. This match really put Show over as a threat since he had to take numerous non-stop chair shots to the head to finally be put down.

[Big Show: A Giant's World]

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion The Rock - Austin came out in a t-shirt instead of his usual vest & took the fight to The Rock quickly as they brawled through the crowd to the stage area back to ringside with Austin dropping two elbow drops on Rock through the spanish table.  A chair was put into play that caused the referee to accidentally get hit while Rock later used the chair to attack Austin all over his body before another referee was taken out.  With Vince McMahon making his way to ringside along with the original special guest referee for this match, this was a match that lived up to the hype.
WrestleMania XV
[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion The Rock - You could feel the tension between both men for weeks & it exploded right from the start when Austin attacked Rock during his entrance with both men blocking each others signature moves early with even Rock attempting Austin's own stunner.  Both men brawled on the outside with Austin hit the Rock with the ringbell busting him open right away before they took it back into the ring with them trading momentum as Rock returned the favor to Austin with the ringbell causing him to bleed.  Both men pulled out all stops using the ringpost & monitor while both attempted the moves like a sharpshooter, the ""Million $ Dream"" that we hadn't seen in years, and Rock delivering Austin's own stunner.  However what this match is most memorable for happened when Vince McMahon appeared & his involvement showing how someone would ""sell their soul"" to become the champion.  Jim Ross described this match best on commentary, ""Off The Page Intense!""
WrestleMania X-7
[The Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]
(Alternate Commentary By Steve Austin & Jim Ross)

(Blu-Ray) WWE Championship/No Holds Barred Match vs. The Undertaker vs. Triple H - Both Triple H & Undertaker were members of the Corporate Ministry at this time & Triple H started out the match fighting Austin in the isleway before Taker came from behind to assist & used the title on Austin.  This was a glorified handicap match as both Taker & Triple H kept working as a team on Austin throughout the match with Austin having to resort to using a chair in order to try to get some momentum in his direction.  However things started to turn when Triple H & Taker started to fight over who gets the win (and the championship) causing them to break up each others pin attempts & have it be every man for himself leading to Austin & Triple H working together at one point to take out Taker.  The Corporate Ministry got involved while everyone that they had an issue with earlier in the night came out as well leading to absolute chaos including Chyna getting a stunner for her troubles.
No Mercy '99 (U.K. PPV)

(Blu-Ray) vs. WWE Champion Kurt Angle - This was Austin's first television appearance since losing the title to Kurt Angle at the previous Unforgiven PPV with WWE Commissioner Regal at ringside to ensure there was no foul play.  Both started being very intense & fast paced with both brawling on the floor with Austin's head bouncing off the announce table resorting to him trying to use a chair before Regal took it away.  Austin tried to beat Kurt at his own game with various submissions like the boston crab before trying to use the championship belt with Regal once again getting involved taking the title away from Austin...and hitting Angle with it allowing Austin to regain the WWE Championship in what would be Austin's last title reign.
""RAW"" Oct. '01

(Blu-Ray) WWE Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle vs. Rob Van Dam - Kurt Angle walked into this match representing the WWE while Austin was representing the WCW/ECW Alliance but the major wildcard here was Rob Van Dam who also a member of the Alliance with Austin but was recently seen talking with WWE Chairman Vince McMahon & delivered frog splashes to both Austin & Angle in the past week so nobody was sure where his allegiance lied.  This was a great triple threat match that had it's moments of two men working together over one guy while it was still every man for himself with one moment where RVD was going for the frog splash but both Austin & Angle moved causing RVD to crash & burn with nobody knowing who he was going to hit.  The main story here was the appearance of Vince McMahon at ringside who not only took out his own son Shane at ringside but also delivered a chairshot to Austin that busted him open from the back of his head.  This was a fun triple threat match that played into all the stories going into the match.
No Mercy '01

(Blu-Ray) vs. The Rock - These two faced off at WrestleMania for the third time & began trading blows early before brawling in the isleway back to ringside with The Rock thrown into the steps.  The Rock targeted Austin's bad legs by clipping them twice & ramming his knee into the announce table & ring post followed by a sharpshooter.  Rock started to get more cocky & wore Austin's vest only for it to bring him bad luck with Austin regaining the advantage before both men were able to apply each others finishers on each other before Rock was able to regain control hitting the people's elbow followed by three different Rock Bottom's to finally gain his victory over Austin at WrestleMania...in what we would later find out to be Austin's last match.
WrestleMania XIX
[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

In the end, the documentary alone is worth the price of this as we've gotten different documentaries on Austin throughout his career on his DVD sets but this is the most complete one of Austin that not only covers his career from start to finish but also we hear from people who we rarely hear from in these presentations.  I have my reservations of the match selection as there are a bunch of repeats on here that we've seen on other sets including Austin's last set but the alternative commentary is a bonus on the WrestleMania matches while Austin made it clear that some of these matches were important to his career which I can't disagree with but I don't see how some selections like the Big Show match is important to the career instead of the Hollywood Blondes winning the tag team titles which still hasn't been released to a DVD to this day.  In the end, an Austin fan is going to have this in their collection but for those newer fans just starting out their Austin collection this I would definitely recommend this before anything previous collect & go out of your way to get the Blu-Ray for all the bonus moments & outtakes alone.  Although this is suppose to be the last set dedicated to Austin, I can only hope in the future we get another Austin set similar to the one we got for Hulk Hogan in that it's an unreleased/rare match collection as so many Austin matches from his days in WCW, USWA, and WWE that have still yet to see the light of day.",1325462400,,19991,4.6224604966139955

From his rookie year to his retirement this dvd covers it all. Almost a 3 hour documentary, which is great because I seen lots of WWE DVDs that offer less than two hours of footage and interviews. I'm glad WWE has decided to place most of Stone Cold's best matches and interviews into one collection. I'm hoping the WWE does the same great job with the Rock dvd coming this february 2012.

4686503,5,B005FWO3OM,"Few superstars ever reach main event status, even fewer reach the legendary level, for a Texas born man named Steve Williams, known by fans around the world as Stone Cold Steve Austin he is in a class all by himself. As easily one of the top 5 or even top 3 superstars of all time, Austin always entertained the fans whether it was in or out of the ring, during his time as an active competitor or as Co-GM of Raw or any number of on air appearances he had.

This set features a very in depth documentary where Steve talks about his time growing up in Texas, how he was trained by WCCW star Chris Adams, his time in USWA, then WCW, ECW and of course his start and eventual run as the top guy in WWE. What was enjoyable about this doc. was Steve's honesty about how he was used then fired from WCW, the Ringmaster gimmick in WWE, the injury he suffered in a match with Owen Hart that almost ended his career, the story behind what was occuring during his life at Wrestlemania XV vs. The Rock.

Also how he felt about his heel turn in '01 and saying he would've changed it had he known the backlash, why he walked out in '02, his comeback and last match with Rock at Wrestlemania XIX and how a health scare the night before almost canceled that match and the best part was him talking about having a blast as the Co-GM and Sheriff of Raw. There are many other subjects discussed with comments from guys like Jim Ross, Vince McMahon, CM Punk, The Rock, Mick Foley and others.

The doc. is probably one of the best WWE has ever done as they really took the time to let some details be shown about various parts of Austin's career and Steve's comments and honesty were very refreshing and made this great viewing for long time Stone Cold fans.

Blu-Ray Exclusive Matches on Disc 1

-5/16/99, No Mercy, No Holds Barred Falls Count Anywhere Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Triple H w/Chyna vs. The Undertaker: From the U.K. we have this rarely seen match, that starts out in the entrance way with all three men brawling, Shane McMahon was determined for Austin to lose the title on this night. Taker and Trips work Steve over for the early going of the match, Austin does get his shots in including a couple of chair shots on both men but its more of a handicap match until things break down, all three go at it and the Corporate Minstry members come down to beat up Austin, then X-Pac, Kane, the Brood and Mankind come down to run them off. Austin ends up hitting the Stunner of Trips and covers him to retain the title. 8/10

-10/8/01, Raw, WWE Chamionship Match, vs. Kurt Angle (Champion): During the horrifying Alliance angle and the Austin heel turn he had some great matches and this was one of them as he and Angle always did well against each other. Angle was far more aggressive than normal as he threw Austin into the announce table and these two just went all out as Steve targets Kurt's knee and neck. They both trade momentum, Austin gets backdropped onto the exposed concrete, but later slaps on the Boston Crab but Kurt gets to the ropes. Angle then locks the hands and hits a couple of german suplexes but gets a lowblow. Commissioner William Regal prevents Austin from using the title belt but Regal then hits Kurt with it, Austin ends up hitting the Stunner and gets the three count to win the title. 8/10.

-10/21/01, No Mercy, Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Kurt Angle vs. Rob Van Dam: It starts off with Angle hitting some big suplexes on both guys and throughout the match each guy gets their moves in, with RVD shining in the main event getting in his set of unique kicks and flips including a big sunset flip off the top onto both men on the outside. Vince McMahon comes to ringside, Angle hits a big throw on RVD off the top rope. Vince comes in hitting Austin in the back of the head with a chair, RVD hits the frog splash but Kurt breaks up the pin, then he hits RVD with 4 german suplexes and the Angle Slam, but Shane interferes then Vince attacks his son. Austin hits the Stunner on RVD and covers him for three. 8/10.

-3/30/03, Wrestlemania XIX, vs. The Rock: The second best of their triolgy and pretty emotional as this was Austin's last match and you could tell something was different as a lot of Steve's offense was countered by Rock, more than their previous matches. Plenty of brawling in and out of the ring, Rock was in full heel mode even doning Austin's vest at one point. Both men had a great showing and after 3 Rock Bottoms the Rock finally beat Austin at Wrestlemania. 10/10.

Disc 2

-An Introduction by Stone Cold: We here from Steve as he says he picked out what matches he felt were important in his career, even if they were released on other DVDs.

-5/1990, USWA, vs. ""Gentleman"" Chris Adams: Not much of note here, it was teacher vs. student as Adams tried jumping Steve from behind but Austin saw him coming and knocked him around the ring for a few, but he misses a splash from the top. Chris beats him up on the outside, even using a steel chair, but as he attempted a suplex into the ring, Austin's manager pulled Adams foot and Steve covered him to win. 3/10. Side Note: The commentary team USWA had here was just awful.

-7/30/94, WCW Saturday Night, w/Ric Flair vs. Sting & Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat: With these four you can't go wrong as Sting & Flair worked well together as Ric sold like you know what to make Sting look great. Steamboat & Steve also had some good chemistry here as they had fought numerous times in the past, Ricky hit a big superplex off the top but only for two. Flair hits an impressive delayed suplex but Sting just pops right back up however soon Ric & Steve are able to work Sting over, even Sherri interferes digging her heel into Sting's eye. Steve does well against Sting, then Ricky works over both guys but gets stopped by Austin then tags Flair who can't keep the Dragon down for three. Sting catches Sherri off the top and throws her on Ric on the outside, but during this Steve rolls up Steamboat for three. 8/10.

-6/23/96, King of the Ring, vs. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts: After being injured in his first match and going to the hospital to get stitches Austin returned and took it to the veteran in this the finals of the KOTR tourney. Jake had bad ribs from his previous match with Vader and Steve went after them immediately, with kicks and punches and he rips off the tape on the ribs to inflict more punishment. Gorilla Monsoon comes in and asks Jake if he wants to continue and he responds with punches to Steve, tries for the DDT but its countered and Austin hits the Stunner and covers to win. 5/10 for the match, 9/10 for the aftermath where Austin cuts a promo and coins the famous Austin 3:16 phrase.

-3/23/97, Wrestlemania 13, Submission Match, vs. Bret Hart w/Special Referee Ken Shamrock: Probably one of the best matches in Wrestlemania history as this went all over the place, into the crowd, around the ring area and was just an all out brawl. It was Austin's breakout match as he really took it to Bret, who was getting more and more boos during the match since the fans were really pro-Austin. Bret worked on Steve's knee setting up for the sharpshooter while Austin just would not quit as he kept fighting back. The finish is very iconic as Bret had the sharpshooter locked on but Steve wouldn't give up and he finally passed out from the pain and Bret is the winner. 11/10.

-12/7/97, In Your House: D-Generation X, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, vs. Rocky Maivia: Over a year before the first of many main event clashes between these two, there's this match thats good as the Nation attacks Steve before the match starts, then D'Lo gets Stunned on the roof of Austin's truck. The Nation keeps interfering, Austin keeps turning back the challenge but Rock stays on Steve knocking around the Texas Rattlesnake. Rock tries using brass knucks but Austin hits the Stunner, pins Rock for three to retain the title. 6/10.

-3/29/98, Wrestlemania XIV, WWE Championship Match, vs. Shawn Michaels, w/Special Guest Enforcer Mike Tyson: Coming into this Shawn had a bad back injury but gutted it out to do this match and part way through when Austin launched him into the corner that wrenched his back even more and from then on Michaels was limping around and not able to do his usual moves. Steve was in full aggressive mode as he hammered Shawn around the ring and the end is quite good as they counter each others finishers with Austin hitting the Stunner and covering Shawn to win his first WWE title. 7/10.

-5/31/98, Over The Edge, WWE Title Match, vs. Dude Love, Special Guest Referee, Vince McMahon: Undertaker was at ringside and with all the odds against Austin, he kept having to fight off Patterson & Brisco at ringside, Vince's officiating and of course Foley himself. Its the expected brawl, Foley takes a hard clotheline off the guardrail to the concrete floor, they battle to the stage where Austin gets backdropped onto a car hood. Back in the ring Foley uses a chair and hits a double arm DDT but only gets two, Austin gets the chair and hits a brutal chair shot but Vince won't make the count and he gets smashed with a chair from Foley on accident. After another ref gets knocked out, Taker prevents Patterson & Brisco from making the count and chokeslams both of them through the announce tables. Austin hits the stunner and Vince counts to three with some help from Austin. 10/10.

-8/30/98, Summerslam, WWE Title Match, vs. The Undertaker: This was the match billed as the Highway to Hell match and these two went all out as they usually did. Its a brutal and physical match, in and out of the ring, with Taker promising there would be no outside interference and it was kept between both of them. Austin wins after countering Taker's top rope walk and hitting the Stunner to retain his title. 8/10.

-3/22/99, Raw, vs. The Big Show: This was to hype the upcoming Austin/Rock and Show/Mankind matches at Wrestlemania XV, Rock was on commentary which added some funny elements to it. Show blocked a few Stunner attempts and Austin had to hit Show numerous times with a chair then hit the Stunner and made the cover to win. 6/10.

-3/28/99, Wrestlemania XV, WWE Championship Match, vs. The Rock (Champion): The first of their triology of Wrestlemania matches and while good and even great at times its likely the least of them in my opinion. It is very good though, as both men go to the outside, with Rock choking out Austin with his own shirt and back in the ring he kicks him around before Rock gets sent to the outside and we're into the crowd and up the entrance way before we see the ring again. Both men use the steel chair a couple of times, then Vince makes his way down and him and Rock stomp Austin before Mankind as the ref comes down and punches out Vince. Austin reverses a Rock Bottom, hits the Stunner and makes the cover to win the WWE title. 9/10.

-4/1/01, Wrestlemania X-Seven, No DQ Match for the WWE Championship, vs. The Rock (Champion): The best in their Wrestlemania trilogy as Austin was the overwhelming favorite here as it was in Houston, Texas. The crowd was on fire and the match was picture perfect, plenty of brawling, some actual wrestling, plenty of counters and an unexpected twist as Vince McMahon comes down and ends up helping Steve win the title after Austin hits Rock with so many chair shots its a wonder he was even able to move afterwards. Steve becomes the WWE Champion. 11/10. The post match handshake was certainly a controversial moment in WWE history.

-9/28/98, Raw, Stone Cold Zamboni: As Vince is in the ring to present the WWE title with Kane and Taker, Austin rushes into the arena in a Zamboni, drives it to the the ring and proceeds to punch out Vince. He is then taken to jail shortly after.

-7/19/01, Smackdown, The Old Stone Cold: Vince is so happy the old Austin is back that he proceeds to play a guitar and a song of his own which causes Steve to smash it over his head and leave.

-6/7/03, Insurrextion, The Highlight Reel: In the U.K. Chris Jericho and Eric Bischoff are in the ring running down the fans, of course Stone Cold comes down and for the next 15 minutes they banter back and forth which makes this one of the funniest segments WWE has done as Jericho and Austin always played off each other well.

This is exactly the type of DVD release WWE should do more often, they put in a ton of effort into the documentary and the extras and really showed how important Stone Cold was to the WWE.",1323043200,4,20695,4.5253147602464505
4686504,5,B005FWO3OM,"I just got done watching this amazing four disc set and I gotta say it's the best Stone Cold release ever. And the reason why is because Austin literally covers everything there is to cover. Plus it's loaded with extra moment's, matches, and segment's and it also covers a section that I've always wanted Austin to cover and that's THE STUNNER. This is a must buy for any Stone Cold fan. This DVD is a 5 Star DVD set. And that's the bottom line cause Stone Cold said so!",1322870400,,470,4.292134831460674
4686505,2,B005FWO3OM,"The documentary and promos are great, but the match selection is a near complete waste of 2 discs. I find it hard to believe that Mr. Austin picked out the matches himself. I understand that WrestleMania is the biggest show of the year and are the most memorable matches (which is quite arguable considering all the PPVs each year.) But surely Stone Cold knows that almost all of these matches here have already been released on multiple DVD sets and are complete crap thanks to the horrific blurring of the Attitude era logo (especially for Mania 15 and 17.)

I would've hoped for more In Your House and Unforgiven type of matches rather than duplicates of the WrestleMania and SummerSlam matches that have been previously released on DVD. Diehard fans of Austin it's a must buy, everyone else the documentary is a rental or worth waiting for when it comes to WWE Classics on Demand in about 6 months. And the sidebar thing is another big minus for newer DVD sets.",1322784000,2,965,4.643274853801169
4686506,4,B005FWO3OM,"Although it is a Great Blu-Ray and a nice wrap up for Stone Colds Career there are a few things that should have been done better!

1) Mick Foley has WAY too much time on this BR, I guess we know why McMahon took him back, it would have seemed way out of place if he was still in TNA. Nothing against Mick, his insight is refreshing BUT why was that time not used on the Rock? ALL of Rocks comments are the canned ones from years ago, why not have a sitdown with him and get a fresh perspective? Why not get Brocks opinion on the scenario that made Steve Quit? It is gone into great lenghts here, surely since they are in talks with Brock they could have done something here.  On the positive, it was nice to see Heyman and others that have not been on TV for a while give a fresh take on Steve!

2) The Censorship (Editing) makes NO SENSE! During the full interview all the promos are UnEdited (ECW Mainly) which is GREAT, however once you view them in full on Disc 3 ALL the Edits are in Full Effect!! Makes NO Sense at all! Words with F's or S's are removed, of Course I can understand that, BUT the other references and words were ONLY cut during the full promos themselves! Also, the ending of SS 2000 (Austin / HHH Car Scene) was a Complete Waste as a ""Promo"", it is Edited and makes no sense without seeing the full match!

3) On the topic of ""Promos"", where are all the Great SS '96 Promos Going into Steve's biggest match with Bret? They were some of, if not the, Best material from Steve that has NEVER Seen the Light of Day! The LiveWire Show is here (that's actualy pretty cool) but the B/W Promos should have been included here!

4) Matches are good but again, they duplicate many while glancing over other gems! Bottom Line, you will NEVER make everyone happy here, there are way too many to choose from!

All in All, a Great Release, a must have? Hmmmmm, that depends on the staying power of Steve himself. For me it was a No Brainer BUT it does not come close to touching the Greatness of the Shawn vs. Bret BR that came out a month or so ago.....that was truly the best BR Ever (from production, to matches, to the honest feeling) from WWF / WWE.....Period!",1322352000,,2174,4.2139423076923075
4686507,5,B005FWO3OM,"For whatever reason, Best Buy started selling this title on Nov. 22nd, so I already own the Blu-ray! So here's my review...

Blu-ray packaging: Great package, they actually included an insert with this one that contains the track listing for each disc. I liked all the artwork on the package, except for the cover.

Documentary: I originally became excited for this release when I heard Austin was going to provide audio commentary for 3 matches. I didn't care for the documentary because we've seen several Steve Austin DVDs released in the past and I didn't believe they could come up with anything else new to say about his career. However, the documentary is the best thing on here! Let me say this before I go any further... this is the single best documentary WWE has produced on a wrestler's career, ever! They put a ton of work into this. For all those that have complained about the poor quality of WWE's documentaries in the past (and justifiably so), you'll be glad to know they have redeemed themselves with this one. The documentary contains all new interviews, shot in HD. This HD video looks tremendous too, it has a warm film look to it, not a flat video look to it, like in so many other WWE DVDs. What makes the documentary feature so good is the massive list of peers WWE included to help tell the story of Austin's career; they include: Mick Foley, Dutch Mantel, Percy Pringle, Jim Ross, Arn Anderson, Paul Heyman, Triple H, Michael Hayes, William Regal, Chris Jericho, Joey Styles, Vince McMahon, Pat Patterson, Gerald Brisco, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, CM Punk, Christian, John Cena, Miz, Jerry Lawler, The Rock, Bill Demott, Booker T and John Morrison. Each of these people give their own thoughts and opinions on Austin's career which adds so much more to the presentation than if it were just Austin himself telling the story. People like Mick Foley, Paul Heyman, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, McMahon and the Rock give their perspective on what it was like to work with Austin as he took off to become the greatest wrestler of all time. While CM Punk and the Miz give passionate and real thoughts from a fan perspective regarding Austin's career during his red-hot WWF run. They cover everything in the documentary, it's long too! If you felt that previous Steve Austin documentaries and interviews were lacking or didn't tell the whole story, then get ready to hear everything from Austin breaking into the business to hosting Tough Enough in 2011 and everything in between. There wasn't a lot I heard that I didn't already know, but there are a handful of things that surprised me. I won't give them away, but the main thing involved Austin laying some bitter feelings to rest that I was glad to see he's put behind him. I really can't say enough good things about this documentary feature, it's tremendous. Austin holds nothing back during the documentary. WWE allowed him to swear (it's censored) and be himself, it's as if Austin is just kicking back and telling his story directly to you. So by the end,  you really feel like you know the man. I think for longtime fans it'll bring back a ton of great memories and new fans will clearly get to see what made Austin the single greatest act in professional wrestling history.

Extras: It's hard to argue with the match listing on this set, it really captures Austin at his best. My only gripe, and it's a small one, is that they only included one USWA match, one WCW matches and zero ECW matches. They almost needed one more disc of matches to truly capture the full journey of Austin's career, but like I said, this is a minor gripe. I really wanted to see more of Austin's USWA and WCW TV Tile run, since those have been virtually ignored in previous Austin WWE DVD releases. With that said, what they did include is some of his best work from WWF. I was glad to see they included Austin vs the Rock for the Intercontinental Title from In Your House DX '97. That early IC Title feud is highly underrated in my opinion and it gave all of us a glimpse into the epic feud that would follow and headline WrestleMania a record setting three times! Austin vs Bret Hart from WrestleMania XIII is included, and unlike on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Bret-Hitman-Hart-The-Best-There-Is-The-Best-There-Was-The-Best-There-Ever-Will-Be/dp/B000AOEPU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - Bret ""Hitman"" Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be</a>&nbsp;DVD, the audio isn't damaged and out of synch! For those that love Austin's promos, skits and vignettes they've included (on the Blu-ray edition) an entire disc dedicated to them! These are truly classic moments in wrestling history. Austin's ECW promos are here, some of Austin's best Bret Hart promos are here, the Tyson Austin confrontation from Raw is here, all of the vehicle gags are here, the Rock's funeral for Steve Austin is here and on and on it goes! They really loaded this one up with some classic moments. Austin and Jim Ross provide alternate commentary on three key matches in Austin's career, however don't expect a lot of insider stories or new information because in these commentaries Austin and Ross simply have fun and call the matches. Austin is very entertaining and funny on commentary, so these additions help freshen up some matches that you may have seen a million times before. The three matches are: Austin vs Bret Hart from WrestleMania XIII, Austin vs Michaels from WrestleMania XIV and Austin vs Rock from WrestleMania XVII - this is not only my favorite Steve Austin match, but it's my favorite WWF/WWE match of all time! (I'm glad I own the original uncensored WrestleMania XVII DVD because the blurring used to cover the old WWF logo is very distracting here).

Blu-ray Exclusive Features: If possible, I strongly urge you to spend the extra money and pick up the Blu-ray edition of this release if you can. It contains some must see exclusives you can't get anywhere else. There are rare bonus matches like: Austin vs Undertaker vs Triple H from No Mercy '99, exclusive interview outtakes that didn't make the final cut of the documentary feature (which are excellent) and exclusive Austin moments like: A Flair for the Gold '93 and classic promos.

Bottom line on this one is that if you're a Steve Austin fan this is a must buy. This is a fitting collection and presentation of arguably the greatest wrestler in history, don't miss this one.",1322092800,43,6481,4.8500451671183376

8470764,5,B005FWO3OM,"I assume there have been many DVDs for the Rattlesnake, but I know only of this and the ""Legacy"" collection. Not much too in-depth as far as the documentary and what Steve already covered, except for some of the details that got omitted--like walking out of the WWE over some controversy about Lesnar, the short-lived return and coming back as the GM and the sheriff.

While a lot of this stuff has been covered, I'm sure no Austin fan will complain, too much. Match selection--as usual--is up to snuff. Not much from EC-Dub or the WCW; shouldn't be too surprised, I guess. A few matches that standout--Austin vs. Taker, any match with The Rock, or the Dude (obviously Mick might have said this was the only ""Dude"" match worth watching).

Maybe the Bret Hart Mania match is not as legendary as some would say, but everyone has opinions. Again--not much Heel Austin from the ""What period""--as far as actual matches, but some good vignettes on Disc 4, and the Highlight Reel segment that closes it is classic, so again, not much to complain about if you're a fan....",1525737600,,1064,4.654255319148936

8470766,5,B005FWO3OM,"Good Stone Cold Blu-ray. Stone Cold is involved with this production and there are many interviews and other great Stone Cold segments here. This is a 3 Disc Blu-ray Set. Disc 1 is Documentary material with 4 matches, one being Wrestlemania 19 vs. The Rock. Disc 2 is 11 matches including Wrestlemania 13 vs Bret Hart, Wrestlemania 14 vs Shawn Michaels, and Wrestlemania's 15 & 17 vs The Rock. Disc 3 is all segments or match build-ups with the Rattle Snake. About 37 clip / segments on Disc 3. Overall this is a great buy for any Stone Cold / Steven J Anderson fan. I give the Blu-ray 9 / 10 only because is wish there was more matches. I already owned The Legacy of Stone Cold DVD 3 Disc Set which is just as good because it has many more matches and wondered if this Blu-ray would be repeat material. It is Not. This is basically a great story told by Stone Cold on film. This Blu-ray has a much better documentary feel to it than the DVD set.
