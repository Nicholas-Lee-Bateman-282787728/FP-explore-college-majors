7870930,4,6304407416,"This movie was pretty good, kinda childish at times, but what do you expect?  Trenton Knight was enjoyable as the young son, Josh. But Invisible Mom #2 was an absolute bomb; it was about as entertaining as watching paint dry.  Even tho I'm a fan of Justin Berfield, even he couldn't save it from mediocrity.",980208000,2,307,4.5636363636363635
7870931,1,6304407416,"Only the laughs are invisible in this tedious, unfunny comedy. Director Fred OlenRay sets a new low, and for the director of ""Bad Girls from Mars,"" that's saying something! It's very sad to see Dee Wallace  Stone, best known from ""E.T.,"" reduced to a film of such  nonexistent ambitions.",922147200,3,287,4.836734693877551
