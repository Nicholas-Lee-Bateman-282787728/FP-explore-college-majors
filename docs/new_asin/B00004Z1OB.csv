7927919,4,B00004Z1OB,"The Fantastic Night (La Nuit fantastique) was made during the Vichy regime in 1942 and directed by Marcel L'Herbier, perhaps best remembered for a series of avante garde siilent films. This film is a fantasy -- maybe. Denis, a student, works nights to make ends meet, but being sleep deprived, he often nods off and dreams of a beautiful woman in white. One night he awakes -- or does he? -- and sees her. Running off to catch up with her, he finds himself embroiled in trying to save her from an arranged marriage. The film does have some shortcomings, the principal one being that Fernand Gravey, who plays the lead, was approaching 40 in real life and is unconvincing as a student but otherwise fine. The photography is excellent overall, but some of the special effects are a little rough or quaint. There is, however, a true sense of magical realism about the film, sort of Gallic Luis Bunuel, and although I found it dragging in the middle it's ultimately worth a watch. My understanding is that the film originally ran longer than 90 minutes but portions were cut for its initial release, over L'Herbier's objections. This version is 90 minutes. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars, I think.",1362873600,,1196,4.64622641509434
