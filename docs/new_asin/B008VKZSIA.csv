8530965,5,B008VKZSIA,"I enjoyed the fact I could rent this digitally. there was some good segments, and  there is a segment  for his web site . It's a video about EFT tapping.

ETA: I have been watching this everyday since I rented it and decided to buy it.
The Main thing I get from this video is to be honest with each and every feeling rather than ignore that feeling, even if it's one that would make someone's eyebrows raise.
Every emotion is a key to my continued moving forward in my own positive momentum.
once I can feel it, I can move up the emotional scale with it. And becos of that I can allow LOA to do the heavy lifting. The negative talk I found is simply allowing me to feel more fully rather than ""eat my emotions"".
.......and I'm not even tapping very much, simply learning about my emotions.",1423180800,3,789,4.246666666666667

8530969,5,B008VKZSIA,"If you know the law of attraction, most of this will sound familiar, but I love the way that Mike Dooley relays his stories and makes us all have an ah ha moment as we see ourselves in a new way. This was a message that spoke to me. I have been working a job that I hate and have been stressed out all of the time. I am releasing that job, following a dream and ready to step into a new life.",1400198400,3,392,3.7349397590361444

8530971,5,B008VKZSIA,"If you struggle with the law of attraction and wonder why it doesn't work for you, you must get this DVD. The Secret for Law of Attraction--What the gurus aren't telling you, gets right to the point. Brad Reed explains how our subconscious blocks hinder our success with the law of attraction. Then he delivers a clear and easy process to help us unblock our path forward. That amazing process is Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT). Mr. Reed's mastery of EFT is presented skillfully so that anyone can learn and apply the process and begin removing blocks to success right now. Plus, when you buy the DVD, you are given access to bonus material on the Internet. The bonuses developed by Mr. Reed include a wealth of supportive and helpful information. I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone applying the law of attraction on the path of creating the life you desire.
