4192195,4,B003TOXL5A,"Call Her Savage(released Nov/32)stars,among others,Clara Bow as Nasa Springer,Gilbert Roland as Moonglow,Thelma Todd as Sunny De Lane,Monroe Owsley as Lawrence Crosby,Estelle Taylor as Ruth Springer and Weldon Heyburn as Ronasa. This Clara's second to last film and is a pre code melodrama with lots of surprises, for those use to seeing post code pics from a little later in the 30s. And includes the plot.
The film opens as Clara's grandparents are making their way westward in a wagon train. Her grandfather is a letch and is openly having an affair with another woman a few wagons back. Just then Indians attack. The aftermath leaves a few dead and a dying man blames her grandfathers sins for getting them into their mess. He takes his boot and crushes the mans throat.
A few years pass and Clara's mother is now married to a boy she knew from her wagon train days. He is away more than he is home. As a result she falls in love with a local Indian and they have a love child:Clara. The mother is careful not reveal the real father to her husband or daughter.
Again the years pass and Clara is now grown up. We first see her horse riding furiously. Suddenly the horse rears up and throws her. The cause is a rattlesnake. She takes out her whip and starts pummeling the snake. Just then a burst of laughter rings out and it is from a half Indian friend of hers(Roland).Mad she starts whipping him until his face is bloodied! The two soon make up,as is her way, but her father has witnessed her antics and calls her back home. There she learns he is sending her to Chicago to a finishing school there. Clara is excited to get from out and under her fathers demanding ways.
She manages to pass the course,but not without cleaning the whistle of one of her fellow students. At a dance she meets up with a local playboy(Owsley)who has just broken up with his girlfriend(Todd).On a whim just to make a friend of his mad,he proposes to Clara and she accepts. Clara's wedding night is a bust. Her new hubby comes home drunk at an early hour of the morning,stays for a short time ,then gets a phone call and is dressed and gone again. Explaining just why he married her he throws $400 at her and leaves.
Clara's father shows up later and tells her he wants nothing further to do with her. Clara is despondent. But she thinks about it and then realizes that Owsley has money,so she decides to capitalize on it and goes on a spending spree. Eventually they're divorced. A few months down the line Clara receives a visit from her ex's lawyer,asking her to go to New Orleans to see him in a sanitarium. She arrives, and even though a guard is told not to leave Owsley alone with her he does,after he bribes him with $10. Owsley gets more and more inappropriate and erratic with Clara. Eventually he is trying to rape her,then choke her. She is rescued in the nick of time. Outside she learns his mind has been affected but should be alright if treated properly(probably syphilis) .Clara says that it is not him she is worried about.
A short time later Clara,still in New Orleans,gives birth to a baby herself;the result of that short time with her hubby on their wedding night. She is now destitute living in a hovel in a bad section of town. She cannot even come in her own building without being molested by a creep who lives there. Desperate she resorts to hooking and manages to pick up a trick this one night. She leaves her baby under the supervision of a neighbours young girl. When the girl leaves the apartment briefly, the man who molests Clara leers at the girl and in his drunken state,he drops a match. As a result the building goes up in flames. When Clara arrives home  she is devastated to learn her baby has died of asphyxiation. At the same time Roland has being trying to track her down and he does. News arrives via a telegram that her grandmother has passed away,leaving her $100,000 richer.
She leaves for New York where she hires a local male escort to show her the town,who turns out is a local guy with loads of money. He takes her to all the gay night spots and even to a sleazy little club where they have to leave when a fight breaks out.
The guy has fallen for Clara and he approaches his dad to get his approval,which is not forthcoming right away. The father sets up a dinner party and invites Todd and Owsley to attend also! Clara is seething but goes along with the charade. Predictably Todd and Owsley end up on the losing end of Clara's temper,as she storms out. Back home,depressed and drinking ,she receives a telegram telling her her mother is on her death bed. She rushes home and it is then Clara's mother reveals who her real father was.
Later sitting by a pond Roland finds Clara and she quizzes him about the Indian her mother named. It fills in a lot of blanks for Clara,especially knowing  why she is the way she is. In the end she says""I'm glad"".Fade to black.
The plot here is quite predictable and the acting by some of the participants can be quite stilted at times. Clara however is a pro and she owns the screen. When she cries you want to hold her in your arms. Clara's diction and acting was top notch and this would prove that the ""IT"" girl still had it where it counted,at the box office.
This being a pre code picture there are a heck of a lot of plot scenarios that you wouldn't see in the post code era,such as Clara as an unwed mother,the philandering grandfather, Clara the hooker and the rape scene. There is even a nightclub scene where two openly gay singers are plying their trade. It all goes to give this picture a gritty and realistic undertone which is actually more interesting than the melodramatic plot.
Technically the film is in full screen mode and is generally clear and crisp. However there are artifacts and defects throughout the picture,common for its age. Unfortunately there are also some tape lines that appear very early on in the film and later near the end. This DVD is an on demand one. Fox has been late getting into the on demand thing but they have outdone their biggest competitor Warners. This film is in very good condition despite its age and has been restored wonderfully,unlike most of Warners product of this era,which they barely do anything to.
All in all while not a great film plot wise(it shows its age),its' grittiness and Clara's wit and charm win you over in the long run. Paramount thought she was washed up. Clara went to Fox and proved them wrong....twice!",1414540800,10,6455,4.483432455395072
4192196,5,B003TOXL5A,"Clara Bow is a great actress and is practically unknown to today's film goer. She is charming, beautiful and bewitching. This film was her last and should be savored by anyone who loves films that were made ""pre-morality code""!",1413158400,3,227,4.846153846153846
4192197,4,B003TOXL5A,"I caught this on TCM, so this review is for the film not the DVD. That has already been reviewed quite well.  I had never seen a Clara Bow film until this one. I was quite impressed by her natural beauty, energy and acting chops. She plays Nasa ""Dynamite"" Springer, a spoiled, strong willed wild child daughter of a wealthy Texas rancher. An only child, she is uninhibited much to the chagrin of her parents. She's constantly at odds with her father and can never seem to win his approval. In an odd beginning, her roots are traced back to the early settlers vs. Native American days. Now, she is dealing with an explosive temper that she can't understand and her moods can swing from laughing and charming to sudden bursts of violence. The film teeters that way too---comedy, drama, tragedy, pathos, etc...as it chronicles Nasa's rise and fall , rise and fall and all due to her  impulsive, unpredictable behavior. If anyone gets on her nerves, look out. After all the trauma Nasa endures (and causes) she comes full circle when a certain truth comes out and she finally realizes why she's the way she is. I can't give this away because by todays' standards it's utterly ridiculous. But in 1932, people still accepted such ideas and absurd beliefs.  However, be that as it may, ""Call Her Savage"" is a fascinating look at a comeback vehicle for a once huge star who faded before her time. And incidentally,  Bow is quite noticeably bra-less as this is definitely a Pre-Code film. At one point, she's become so destitute she turns to prostitution. Here's another one that is in need of restoration  and proper preservation. Bow was an icon in her day and this film proves she had survived the transition from silents to talkies beautifully.",1411776000,7,1739,4.688524590163935
4192198,4,B003TOXL5A,"First and foremost, thanks to the studio for putting out a decent copy of this film on DVD. I feel this was worth the money, even given my comments below.

An FYI to fellow travelers- just to confirm your guess is correct, this is not restored. It is a surprise, sometimes, when an unrestored DVD is taken from great elements, and looks almost new. This isn't one of those times.  The print isn't bad, but not great either, more along the lines of ""acceptable.""  It is a few generations from the original. There are times when you can see the circular marks in the corner of the frame that theaters would put on prints to signal the projectionist that a reel change was about to happen. This means that at least some of the elements came from theatrical copies, and given how many different circles pop up on the same scene, these were either heavily used theatrical prints, or copies of copies. The print is soft, and the contrast is a bit ""off"" (as happens with copy prints).There are numerous dust specks and scratches. There are also some sort of blotchy artifacts that show up frequently, and don't move like scratches do. They show up as slightly brighter spots in vertical rows and horizontal rows. Like I said, not a terrible print, but the defects are noticeable. I'm not meaning to disparage this DVD, just being honest about what it is. Even with these flaws, this is the best print I have seen, and is probably the best we will ever have offered.

I agree with the last reviewer, I would love to see decent prints of other long out of circulation Clara Bow (and Louise Brooks) movies made available on DVD. I would continue to pay the ~$20 per title to finally get decent copies of these.",1408924800,17,1700,4.509740259740259
4192199,5,B003TOXL5A,"Great to see that this Clara Bow classic is finally being made available as an ""official"" release.  This is one of the most over the top, yet highly enjoyable of pre-code films, with Clara's cat-fight confrontations with Thelma Todd being especially memorable.  Now, if Fox would only get on the ball and release Clara's underrated swan-song, HOOPLA (1933), and MCA would do the same with THE WILD PARTY (1929) and KICK IN (1931).  Here's hoping!",1408492800,18,446,4.92
8405350,5,B003TOXL5A,This is one of my favorite movies. Call her savage is a movie made in 1932 and it's story line is way beyond it's years. It depicts the struggles of a young woman throughout her life.,1509235200,,183,4.111111111111111
8405351,1,B003TOXL5A,Another DVD-R rip off. Poor picture quality on a format that degrades. Shameful.,1458950400,,80,5.230769230769231
8405352,1,B003TOXL5A,"I watched this because I love Clara Bow, and only she could make this movie watchable.

The plot of this movie was all over the place, difficult to follow, too long, dragged out, and boring.

The ending was abrupt.

The title did not fit the movie.

It would have been nice if this movie was restored and colorized.",1457740800,,315,4.379310344827586
8405353,2,B003TOXL5A,"An old curiosity from a silent film legend, the 'It' girl, Clara Bow.  This is a talkie, one of Clara's few.  She prances around is a somewhat see-through blouse and then some lingerie but it doesn't help the film at all.

DVD transfer is weak and hard to watch.  Passable but just barely
Recommended for film historians only of those building a Clara Bow shrine.",1452643200,,363,4.538461538461538
8405354,5,B003TOXL5A,"I was very pleased to see this wonderful Clara Bow film on DVD, and at a decent price.  Before buying I read the other reviews and quite a few mentioned the rather poor quality of the print - scratches, holes, etc - but that for the old film that it was, it was still worth purchasing - if you're a Clara Bow fan. So I bought it, knowing that it would be a rather low quality print, but happy to have it nonetheless.

WELL!  My print looks great!  Obviously it's not Blu-Ray quality but, honestly, I was not aware of any scratches or holes - I'm sure they're there but I thought the print was very good.  I didn't see any holes in the copy I received.  There are probably scratches but I can't recall seeing any.  It's a good, clear print.

So I'm very happy with this purchase.",1435363200,5,778,4.174496644295302

8405358,4,B003TOXL5A,"This film really deserves the full restoration treatment and some nice pre-code DVD extras to go along with it.  It is so unusual in so many ways that it's completely fascinating.  It is a great combination of the ridiculous mixed with the serious.  Today it seems totally over the top, but when it came out I believe the film makers had no idea of the camp factor they were shooting into this production.  It also has the first depiction of a gay bar--or at least gay entertainers in a bar.  I've seen this in a movie theatre 3 different times and the audience always howls with laughter and a kind of gasp that says, ""I can't believe they went there!""  The film seems incredible because one doesn't usually think of films from the '30s as being this racy.  This film might just be the height of all that pre-code films have to offer.  It is tedious, shocking, delightful and astounding all at once.",1423180800,4,900,4.478527607361963
