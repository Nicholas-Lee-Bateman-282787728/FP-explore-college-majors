654657,5,6303467717,"I love this movie. It is one of my favorites. Jodie Foster is simply amazing as Nell. Patricia Richardson and Liam Neeson were good too as small town doctors observing her behavior... This movie was great, and I don't  see why everyone thought the last part of it was bad. Someone tell me..  please! I just don't get it. I thought this movie was great.",948758400,5,352,4.4
654658,5,6303467717,"""Nell"" tells a parable of how we understand each other by standing in each other's places. In other words, it is a movie about healing. ""Nell"" shows us a three-way emotional dance between a ""wild woman,"" a country doctor,  and an academic psychologist. Nell is the ""wild woman"" whose  self-sufficiency fascinates  Dr. Jerry Lovell.  Lovell, emotionally raped  by a past marriage, approaches Nell with fear and trembling. But he is  fascinated by the possibility of self-sufficiency.  Into this situation  marches  Dr. Paula Olson, rendered hard by abandonment and academic  medicine, armed with needles and nosology.  In the most beautiful of  forests they meet, in a healing dance subtly orchestrated by Nell, the  person they imagined they would rescue.  There's more to the story-but see  it for yourself.  Warning: ""Nell"" is not intended to be a clinically  accurate picture of idioglossa (private speech developed in social  isolation).  It is a parable about the ""different,"" the ""backward,"" and the  outcast person, who lives in a ""far country"" that every damaged child must  visit.",938044800,3,1089,5.251461988304094
654659,5,6303467717,"Filmed just a few minutes from my house in North Carolina, this film is one of my most beloved favorites. Jodie Foster's performance rocks and evokes tears in the audience. The music is also touching and emotional and  the photography is a superb standout. A winner all around, and my homeland  never looked more gorgeous.",924739200,3,322,4.836363636363636

For those of you who don't read the reviews on IMDb, the brilliance of her role is that her dialogue is completely unscripted. Instead, she studied victims of strokes in rehabilitation centers to learn the speech and behavior patterns.",1498089600,,345,4.864406779661017

655240,4,6303467717,"Impressive performance by Jodie Foster.  Plausible story line in an ""eva'dur"" world for the survivor of a pair of twins born of a rape and partial paralysis of Nell's ""civilization"" avoiding mother.  I empathize with the deceased at the outset of the story mother since I have chosen a similar loner lifestyle based on avoiding similar *evil doers*, albeit with no offspring to try to raise to anything like my own post graduate level of education.  That empathy does not, however, rise to identification with the substance of the story which largely focused on the evil doers among whom Nell would have to survive in ""civilization"".  Along with competent acting by the rest of the players, the film was well photographed and produced, worthy of a four star rating.",1470787200,,765,4.906976744186046

This is an amazing movie, based on a true story, about a young woman isolated from society; and grieving the death of her twin sister and her mother, the only two people she could trust. Now, confronted with the possibility of being placed into a mental institution and deemed incompetent by the court; due to her lack of social skills, and becoming a psychiatrists Pulitzer and the joke of the town , she begins the journey of learning to socialize with the great big world outside her primitive surroundings. Jody Foster, does an amazing job in her role as Nell. Unless you just don't have the stomach for real acting, or only find reality TV, soap operas, and super hero films worthy of viewing; this movie is a must see, and deserves FIVE stars, not 3 1/2!",1464220800,2,907,4.503030303030303

I gave it 5 stars because of great performances by two good actors. Worth seeing. It's about a girl about 28 that is hidden from others and lives in the woods with her mother. She has not seen anyone but her mother for most of her life and because her mom had a stroke she grew up speaking a strange sounding English because her moms speech is distorted due to the stroke. It's about getting her back into society safely.,1458172800,4,558,4.314285714285714

655872,5,6303467717,"In the solitary mountains of North Carolina, a girl is raised away from any public contact by her devoted mother who suffered a stroke giving birth so that Nell's language is a reproduction of her mother's strongly affected language. Now her mother is dead and Nell is alone there, being watched by psychologists and a doctor.
  This is without a doubt Jodie Foster's most impressive performance. Perhaps not even Meryl Streep could have done this as well.
  The cinematography is remarkable, beautifully reminiscent of ""Out Of Africa."" Filmed entirely on location this film had to have been a challenge, boats and barges taking the crew and equipment to a remote wonderland paradise. Many wide angle lenses make for a cinematic miracle. The performances are top notch. It's highly surprising that Jodie Foster didn't get an Oscar nod, though this film won many other awards both in the United States and Internationally.",1457049600,3,921,5.079470198675497

It evoked just about every human emotion one can feel, and addresses so many concerns that plagues our world.  I went from shock to compassion, anger, tears...etc...and finally the joy of triumph in the human spirit.  Even though both doctors loved Nell, it was the compelling insight of Neesom's character into Nell that led to her salvation from a continued life of wilderness living, or as a lab specimen in a cold and clinical environment.  He saw that beyond the wild and frightened look of Nell, beyond her gibberish chatter, there was intelligence. He saw a human being that needed help.

Jodie Foster and Liam Neeson are great actors,  Jodie's performance as Nell is superb.",1456963200,3,788,4.835820895522388

She is discovered in the grandmothers home in the wilderness after the grandmother is found dead by a delivery boy. Enter Liam Neeson and his gentle and caring character, he'll turn out to be Nell's guardian angle. I especially like watching him in a role such as this where there isn't a lot of shoot 'em up stuff.

656574,5,6303467717,"Jodi Foster's award-winning tour de force, is quite an amazing story and movie, and it made me cry.  I had to spend a couple of days exploring WHY it made me cry exactly.  I decided it was mainly a sort of loss of innocence, or more precisely, the loss of wildness--where the world just overwhelms every instinct you have and you just breakdown under the conformity of it all.  Which gets me to the problem I had with the story.  Nell seems (five years after her short incarceration in the mental ward) a little TOO normal, despite the setting at her original home overlooking the lake, deep in the wilds of her home forest.  I dunno.  I kind of  expected her to become this wild, compassionate, super healer that could touch a person's face and instantly heal them of any emotional problem (they do go there, but it's not even a subplot line, which I think it could have been).  Instead, we are left with a hopelessness that she will ever return  to the primal wildness that made her special in the first place.  Kinda  a letdown, which is why I almost gave this 4 stars.  But, Foster's strength of character and unabashed performance is truly awe-inspiring.  Liam Neeson always seems like he's phoning it in, but it kind of fits for his affable,big-ol-lunk role.  I might watch this as a double feature with ""Lucy""--two misunderstood freaks of nature just trying to keep from being destroyed by society.",1433721600,4,1405,4.612903225806452

expressing not the economic philosophy of laissez-faire, but opposing the do-gooder
philosophies and psychologies of those who would ""help"" people by tyrannically interfering
with their lives, destroying what they do not understand, often to satisfy their own career objectives

657330,5,6303467717,"One of my favorite female actors of all time, Jodie Foster never fails to deliver anything but a knock-out performance.  She simply astounds as the surviving twin of an elderly mother who raised her in total isolation from the world, even to the point of her not being able to speak English, but a language created within her limited world.  She pulls off the ""feral"" nature of her character when first discovered, and you feel as if you're watching a true story of how a woman this isolated emerges to confront the wider world that surrounds her.  Liam Neeson also delivers a powerful performance as part of the team that encourages Foster's character to grow.

 I watched it for my Class discussion. We had to talk about adult person who had some type of disability.
Even though Nell did not have disability, in a beginning of the movie, psychologist  came to conclusion that Nell had
speech impairment, developmental disability since she was raised in a forest, without any interaction with other people.
In my opinion we should look deeper, not just on how people talk or how people look like. Nell knew how to survive in her
little world, and kept her balance. When doctors took her to the hospital, they found that they made a mistake by removing
Nell from her place. To say more will ruin the movie, one who is interested should watch the movie and see by herself/ himself
how great Jodi Foster performed in  this movie.",1415836800,,776,4.608695652173913

An extraordinary, dynamic story of a Appalachian crone and her daughter, Nell, living a simple life of chosen self-seclusion, zero contact and communication with the public and the modern world, while existing with the barest convienences.

The only people she knew were her mother and twin sister. They lived together in a remote cabin in the forest. Nobody has ever met Nell. After her mother's death, she's discovered by the local doctor Jerome (Liam Neeson). He's fascinated by her, since she speaks a mangled language, developed by her sister and herself growing up, a ""Twin speak"" if you will. But Paula (Natasha Richardson), a psychology student, wants her observed in a laboratory. The judge decides they get three months to observe her in the forest, after which the court will decide about Nell's future.

658118,5,6303467717,"I can think of few performances that are on par with this. Olivier in his final film King Lear is certainly one in which the actor is completely subsumed into the character played. Kate Winslet as Ophelia in Branaugh's Hamlet is another. Ms Foster seems not only subsumed in this character, but she radiates in there & it shows in this film. It would be easy to dismiss this character as sub-human or less than human, but the range of emotion is amazing. At times subtle at other times explosive, Nell is a character that invites & demands your attention, your sympathy but most of all your compassion. There are times when her face is just like looking into a mirror but then you find yourself looking into a universe of personality. This isn't acting, this is a real person portraying what anyone has gone through in life in microcosm.  And when she smiles, it's indescribable..................",1412899200,,896,4.743589743589744

As a cynical Yankee living in the south, I love all three actors in this film. This story called for real acting, and they gave it their all. Jodi was so graceful, and convincing as the ""wild child"". Historically this is the film that Liam Neeson and Natasha Kinsky met, and fell in love, so in their love scenes they weren't acting ! Ok maybe by Marvel heroes standards this is dull, no one dies, no one blows up, it's just people telling a story, and I like reality! Kudos to people who wrote this story , and to the reviewer who said the story isn't plausible..... Honey you haven't seen how thick the woods are up in the Smokies.... It's very possible, I'm a Hospice Nurse and I have been amazed at how easy it is to go just 45 min away from a big city to find people who can barely print their name. But they can differ honest from phony quick, and they will treat honest sincere people with warmth and respect.

Where do I even start? This type of psychological issue would not present itself this way...ever. What's with the weird jaw movements, LSD-like body swaying? It's like she's a high hippie at woodstock throughout the whole movie. I can understand that leaning language from a mother who had a stroke would lead to speech deficits, but are we supposed to assume that isolation from ""civilized society"" also leads to strange body movements and facial contortions? And what's with the strange sexual innuendo going on the whole time? It reminded me of a cheap independent film that found any reason to show boobs. I'm not sure what all the praise is about with this movie. Of all the poor qualities, the worst was just how poorly written the plot was.",1383350400,5,916,4.767295597484277

658604,4,6303467717,"When I saw `Nell' as child, I laughed.  I just didn't connect to this film on any level.  When I was a teenager I wrote it off thanks to my former memory of it and so it wasn't until a few months ago that I even entertained the idea that I should give it another chance.  I'm glad that I did.  While the film is not perfect, and the overall message of the whole thing seems almost force-fed in the end (that courtroom speech feels forced), the film has a serious identity and it packs a punch thanks to a commanding turn from Jodie Foster and a streamlined focal point.

The film centers on a doctor who discovers a young woman no one was aware existed, living in the shack of a deceased old woman.  Her behavior is odd and her speech is even odder and this interests the doctor.  With the discovery of this bizarre young woman, this doctor begins to fight an almost uphill battle as he attempts to keep her shielded from the inevitable (psychiatric confinement and study).  He works to understand her backstory as well as her language and unlocks her past in order to save her future.

The film would have fallen to pieces had Foster not been so grounded and dedicated to the role.  I'm not an advocate for her as an actor, to be honest, and I'm often the first one to criticize the blandness of her acting, but she really nails this and delivers possibly her finest performance.  This is an extremely hard role to master and deliver without coming across as campy or awkward, but she handles herself like a true professional.  Honestly, had Oscar not showered her with two underserving wins, she probably would have won the Oscar for this.

`Nell' is one of those film that could really use a rewatch from many, I'm sure.  I know that I wasn't expecting to change my mind so drastically, but this film is far more heartfelt and effective than I gave it credit for.",1382572800,,1866,4.402332361516035

658609,5,6303467717,"I think it's best for the viewer to experience this movie without knowing the plot, so I'll try not to reveal much of the plot in my review.  It's an excellent movie that I think will be meaningful (and delightful) to any sensitive and caring person.

It's the unusual story of a ""wild-child,"" an ""uncivilized"" adult girl found living in the mountainous backwoods of North Carolina.  The doctor who discovers her also discovers, when he opens a Bible, that he has been appointed (more or less by God) to be the girl's ""guardian angel."" In a sense, he tries to be her ""savior"" too.

The movie is based on a play that was entitled ""Idiographia,"" so the language factor must have been central in the play as it is in the movie.  The title of the movie is ""Nell,"" and it focuses upon the opening up of communication that allows a CONNECTION (note the scene of two hands of two persons reaching out and clasping) and the emergence of a Person.  Relational knowledge and love becomes possible for all the characters involved in the story.

One theme that the movie touches on is ""innocence""--and the violation of it.  (As, for instance, the innocence that existed in Paradise and its absence after the Fall.  This is my own choice to make the comparison relating the movie to the events of Genesis, but it's an apt comparison that fits the setting and the relational love plot.  The movie doesn't OVERTLY suggest that any comparison should be made to Biblical concepts and images, but I would say that it does subtly invite such comparisons which can add depth to the story when looking at it in retrospect.)

Another theme in the movie is aloneness and specifically alienation from the ability of loving relationships (embodied even more in the modern urban civilization than in the isolated woods).  While the movie weaves into the plot the tragedy of modern sexual alienation, it also includes two hopeful and positive male-female relationships.  And it includes the importance of relations of friendship, the inter-relational compassion that all humans are capable of.

Fortunately, I watched this movie a second time (about a year after the first viewing).  After the second viewing I realized how good the movie was and decided to write a review recommending it highly.

An important thing I noticed on the second viewing was the great importance to Nell of her twin sister.  That love relationship was the most significant and joyful one that Nell had known, and it was steeped in childhood innocence.

(At a subtle level, if the viewer wanted to consider a psychological interpretation, I guess that relationship of Nell and her twin could also signify a person's loving relationship with self.  But, again, this is not a concept that the movie deliberately deals with.  But, I do think the movie intends to help viewers grow in their inner selves, becoming more capable of being loving persons.)

Nell remains a beautiful innocent, but not innocent of sorrow.  She also becomes an unexpected agent of compassion and healing, not merely the needy object of compassion.

If you can look into it attentively and appreciate it well, this is a beautiful, beautiful movie.

The final scene is satisfying for the viewer, but it leaves some practical questions unanswered.

(I think only adults would appreciate the movie.  One or two scenes might be disturbing for children.)",1378166400,,3371,4.870175438596491

This is a film for the soul. It's a film for the heart of one who has unfolded enough to recognize what is true in the pure and untouched simplicity of this life, and what is not. Such a film as this is reassurance that indeed there are others in the world who understand and recognize what is pure and true.

658715,5,6303467717,"In my opinion this is Jodie Fosters most powerful performance. She deserved to win the Oscar as Clarice Starling in Silence of the lambs, but what amazes me is that she didn't win the Oscar for this incredible performance which truly does outshine her work in Silence of the lambs. Shes simply Amazing as Nell. This is a phenominal actress who took on this role of a lifetime and turned it into gold. Jodie Foster had to bare her soul to play this part, and its simply amazing to watch her lay herself bare in body and soul to play this unique character. This is a great actress in an unforgettable role. Both Liam Neeson and Miranda Richardson rise completely to the occasion as two physicians trying to communicate with Nell who speaks her own language. They were both wonderful. And it reminded me that nearly 8 or 10 years ago Richardson passed away. Very sad indeed. I remember seeing her as an evil and heartless b i t c h in the made for TV film- Born Innocent which featured Linda Blair in the lead role. Its amazing to know Richardson was able to avoid being type cast after the nasty role she played in that film which was made in the mid 1970s, and she went on to better things despite the part. Its indeed sad shes no longer on this earth because she truly was a great actress. Anyway This film is full of beautiful moments, spiritual realization and love. A wonderful story that is unlike any youve seen before. Foster proves again and again she is one of the finest human beings in the field of acting there is on this planet, and Nell represents Foster at her absolute most dazzling and human brilliance.",1367884800,,1619,4.436241610738255

658786,3,6303467717,"Jodie Foster, Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson all did a great job. My issue with this movie is that the storyline is illogical. It did not make sense. Language is learned when children are very young. That would not have been when Nell's mother had her series of strokes. Nell would have already learned how to talk.  Supposing the strokes could have and did occur when the woman was young? Who would have looked after Nell then, while this woman was recovering?  Nell was supposedly not retarded.  However, if she was, the movie would have made more sense. I also felt that Nell's repetitive motions went on a bit longer than they should have.  I found myself saying ""get on with it"".

658990,5,6303467717,"Jodie Foster is brilliant as Nell, a young woman who has lived in the deep woods all her life, never knowing anyone but her recluse mother and her long dead twin sister. She speaks a language of her own, apparently derived from Biblical English and the twin-speak she and her sister developed in their isolated world.

When her mother finally dies, the young man who normally delivered their groceries (and who didn't even know Nell existed) discovered the old recluse's body, all laid out properly. He told the sheriff, who took the local doctor along to investigate. Dr. Jerome Lovell (Liam Neeson) discovers Nell hiding in the cabin after the sheriff has left with the body, and he doesn't quite know what to do about her. But Dr. Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson, Neeson's real-life wife), a psychiatric researcher he consults, wants to bring her to the hospital to be studied. Dr. Lovell argues that she should stay in her natural environment, and a judge gives them three months to study her in her own home before he makes a decision.

They untangle a lot of the facts about her life, especially after Jay Lovell starts to translate her language, and then Dr. Olsen makes the startling discovery that it is in fact English, more or less. Working somewhat together and somewhat at odds with one another, Jay and Paula are encouraged by Nell to be friends, and eventually lovers.

There are no real villains in the piece, except to the extent that people who would like to exploit Nell are pretty villainous from her point of view. In her language, she calls them evil-doers, apparently due to a Bible passage. It becomes clear that she and her twin were the product of a rape, and that their mother taught them to hate and fear men. She trusts Jay mostly because she decides he is her guardian angel (another of her words that took some time to translate).

It's a fascinating story, and I looked in vain for evidence that it was based on a true story. It is that well-written and acted and produced, that it was very easy to believe it was real. And one cannot help but love the innocent Nell.",1336780800,,2099,4.619302949061662

658996,5,6303467717,"A well loved, cared for, clean, healthy young woman is left alone by the deaths first of her identical twin, then of her mother. The women lived in isolation in remote Appalachia for the twins' entire lives. The mother was raped as a young woman, suffered a stroke, then withdrew to forest solitude for self protection with her bible as comfort.

The babies taught themselves twin speech, idioglossia, a private language developed when there is restricted language input. The mother's stroke limits speech, except for the passionate musicality of memorized rote recitation of bible passages. Brain areas for music are distinct from those for speech and may be spared in stroke. That may be the reason those who speak more than one language particularly musical languages (Chinese, French) are more resilient after brain attack.

The mother's stroke results in halt gait mimicked by the twins, who are cautioned to avoid daylight as dangerous. The mother's intention is to protect the twin girls from being seen, and possibly raped by an ""evildoer"" with a ""skewer."" The mother realizes she may one day pass on, and leaves an ethical will in her bible to whomever finds the adult child after her death, requesting compassion, caregiving and protection.

Nell is not a feral child (raised in wilderness among animals without human speech). Nell was well loved, has language, openness, intuition for emotional connection, empathy for feelings. Her natural diet (no junk food) and self care result in strong teeth, bones, mental health. Her language is unintelligible except to her twin and mother. Interestingly she uses te for me. In Latin te means thee or you.

When Nell is threatened she speaks into a mirror, to an image of her dead twin, reciting over and over ""may and te"" as if she has no identity separate from her remembered twin and feels comfort in their fusion. This developmental step is not taken until later in the movie when she releases her infancy and joins reality.

Nell is not autistic, her social relationship skills are excellent. A non-actor autistic child Nicole appears with her mother in the hospital scene in order to inform the viewer of the difference between autism and idioglossia (unique private language)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Temple-Grandin/dp/B0038M2AZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Temple Grandin</a>.

The nurturing environment of wilderness, soul quiet allows Nell to retain images of her other half for soothing comfort against confusion or vulnerability. Their childhood games of holding one another's hands in body mimicry, falling backward into the lake, dancing and caressing one another in sleep are her respite from threat.

Nell exposes lies we tell ourselves about the meaning of life. Nell suggests verbal language inhibits deep resonance between human beings. Talking offers an illusion of connection behind a wall of self deception about who we really are.

Nell is never alone because she has the memory of being well loved. Her uninhibited spontaneity allows her to bring up the imagery she needs for calming at will, the mindful awareness of meditation&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dhamma-Brothers/dp/B0040J1RZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dhamma Brothers</a>.

Later, as Nell is introduced to modern society, sheds her imaginative capacity and bids an agonized farewell to her twin image forever. The grief seen on Nell's face as she reflects on who she used to be, and who she is now, is complexly entwined with the joy of new real human connections.

Both the sorrow of loss and joy coexist in the last scene. Nell teaches a real child the freedom of movement as emotion.

Holding onto the illusion of someone else outside, a guardian angel, a doctor, a therapist, being able to create meaning will always lead to loss. Everyone leaves, dies, withdraws.

Nell leads a small life with a small answer to meaning in life: physical-emotional connection with humans. She gives up the fantasy memory of her twin for real human beings in the present with regret.

Nell's intense focus absorbs the emotions of others, without guile or deception. Her face is blank, open receptive, which may appear incomprehending but is simply a reflection of her total concentration on the other person, sometimes losing her own identify in the focus.

The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances; if there is any reaction, both are transformed.  Jung

For Nell contact with the outside represents danger, even from well-meaning physicians not be able to protect her from exploitation by media, researchers, groupies. The loss of all that is familiar with meaning for Nell is dramatic and overwhelming as she is consigned to a psychiatric hospital. Nell withdraws into mute paralysis for protection from overstimulation.

The courtroom fight over her right to autonomy vs. institutionalization under guardianship is thoughtful and moving.

Nell's lullaby was bible reading, rote memorized for self comfort, a form of meditation (compare with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dhamma-Brothers/dp/B0040J1RZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dhamma Brothers</a>&nbsp;Vipassana meditation). Nell is naturally open, exposed, vulnerable. Her heart truth is on her face, her moral compass is godliness. Her speech is entwined with body movement, dance: hugs, touching hand to face, forehead to forehead to reconciliation. Perhaps if we attempt conflict resolution with forehead to forehead empathy we may be more successfully connected. When my mother was dying of stroke in coma for months I put my forehead to hers, she reached her hand up and pulled my neck close. Human connection without words.

Nell is not intellectual verbal, she is intuitively emotional. A life of solitude enables Nell to listen without judging to her own and others' feelings.

The Sheriff's wife has panic attacks which are soothed by hand dance movement with Nell.  Nell's gift is unspoken empathy. She reminds us to listen to our bodies for what we genuinely need (not just want).

In order for a baby to survive, a mother bird shoves the baby out of the nest when it is time to learn to fly. If you genuinely love someone, you must push them into the world, they need and deserve the truth for their survival&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cedar-Rapids/dp/B004X8AIE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cedar Rapids</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-3/dp/B00275EHJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story 3</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dhamma-Brothers/dp/B0040J1RZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dhamma Brothers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hobart-Shakespeareans/dp/B000CRR3GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hobart Shakespeareans</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runaway-Bride-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00003IPFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runaway Bride (Widescreen Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sommersby/dp/B0045HCJRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sommersby</a>.

Maturity is a farewell to child-self, innocence, total absorption in fantasy. We are each alone, afraid. Everyone is frightened. We hunger for quietness and connection: Yin and Yang of polar opposites, balance on a knife edge which is jiggling. All we have is each other and ourselves

659088,5,6303467717,"Though it was made almost 17 years ago, I just this afternoon saw this film for the first time. I was blown away. The entirety of the piece is filmed in such an earthy, intoxicating, truly haunting way. My heart broke over and over, and yet shouted for joy again and again - for Nell, for Dr. Lovell, for Paula. I watched ""Nell"" on my own time; however, as a medical student, this film is incredibly pertinent to my studies. Many would've seen (and indeed, some did see) Nell as ""crazy""; would've had her locked up without any reconsideration of the subject - the result of other individuals projecting their views and realities onto her. We know innately that this is unacceptable, yet it still sometimes happens in medicine today. This film served, for me, as a well-placed reminder of ""first, do no harm"" and the many forms in which the mantra can materialize. The film also peels back some of the layers of the human psyche - what REALLY happens when humans live alone? Not just alone, but totally isolated? What makes us who we are? Is it us? The people around us? The world we live in? I was incredulous at how strongly I emoted with Nell as she remembered the bond she had with her twin sister - a bond that not even science can completely understand or explain - and the emptiness she felt in the world after the only two souls she knew had left it. I shed many tears with Nell as the movie progressed. This is a tribute both to the filmmaking and to Jodie Foster's INCREDIBLE skill as an actress and producer. ""Nell"" is both amazing and awe-inspiring. I know it will be a long time before I can forget or even stop thinking about this film.

659091,5,6303467717,"A superb film on the subject of an isolated woman who survives in her own world and the inevitable difficulties when she is confronted with the alternative.

Liam Neeson is brilliant as the dedicated Doctor who takes the trouble to investigate, understand the strangely cropped linguistics of Foster, and realizes the fundamental stability of her situation despite the sometimes eccentric behaviour that she evinces.

The battle with the establishment and their knee jerk reaction towards forced institutionalization is brilliantly complemented by the non involved Psychiatrist who gradually is drawn into the investigation that Liam's character undertakes and eventually comes to his side as a no longer disinterested ally.

The ending, which will not be revealed here, is superbly satisfying.

There are many ways this film could have gone all wrong.  But the director, producers and wonderful skills of top notch actors made it into the masterpiece that it deserved to be.
Oscar level performance by Jodie Foster.

A great film on several levels, satisfying, and it manages to include a powerful statement against the prevailing forces of medical dehumanization which are now under fire from many different quarters.

659092,5,6303467717,"Jodie Foster plays Nell, a young woman who lives all alone in a secluded forest in North Carolina. She's been living with her late mother her entire life, and now she's in complete isolation with only a handful of people ever realizing her existence. She has her own language, her own shelter, and her own look at the beautiful world around her. Jerome and Paula (Liam Neeson & the late Natasha Richardson) are doctors who examine her language and her communication skills. These will help them figure out if Nell is able to handle the real world (the world that she has hardly any knowledge of).

This has to be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The woods and lakes of North Carolina are magnificently shot. The music by Mark Isham is ambient and effective. The look and feel of this film is extraordinarily beautiful. Plus, this is one of Jodie Foster's finest performances. Her unusual movements and behaviors are almost flawless when seen onscreen. Neeson and Richardson are also fantastic as the two doctors who realize that Nell is more than just a so-called ""wild child."" Jeremy Davies, Nick Searcy, Richard Libertini, and Robin Mullins make a fine supporting ensemble. Now, some people have criticized this movie for being too melodramatic. The only scene that I found a bit melodramatic was the courtroom scene near the end. It does feel slightly operatic in an unnecessary way, but that's my only complaint. This film has sheer beauty all over it. It looks like it just turned into a brand new favorite of mine.

The most outstanding feature of the movie is Jodie Foster's performance in the title role- a remarkable one even by the standards of this talented actress.

Jodie Foster's performance as Nell made an almost incredible character totally believable. How she didn't get an oscar for her performance says more about the oscars than about the enormous range and empathy of this superb actress. She was assisted by a wonderful complementary and vulnerable performance from Liam Neesom and the sensitive exploration of a very difficult subject by Michael Apted. I found myself crying without immediately understanding why. I then realised that the film had plumbed the depths of my humanity to levels I did not realise existed. It confronted the question of what it is to be a fully individual human being going beyond our place in a so called civilised society to our almost instinctive spiritual responses to the natural world and to relationship. This is a truly deep and rewarding film which deserves a wide audience.

This is a movie which explores that topic to some degree.  Jodie Foster plays a young woman (Nell) who has been raised in almost absolute seclusion from the rest of the world.  She has her own language which she uses from the garbled words of her grandmother who had a speech-impediment.  She knows nothing of the world beyond the cabin where she lives, and she's afraid to go outside during the daytime.

Liam Neeson & the late Natasha Richardson portray a physician & a shrink, respectively.  They both have the best interests of Nell in mind & end up in an unlikely alliance to look out for her.  After all, being exposed to a big city is an unnerving & stressful thing for a young lady that has only known the peace & tranquility of the forest all her life.

It goes without saying that it's absolutely painful to see Natasha Richardson with the man who was her real-life husband.  She is so very beautiful & full of life;  it's a tragedy that she was taken from us too soon.  It is little wonder that Liam Neeson fell in love with her;  while watching this movie, I did as well!

Word to the wise:  this is a fairly slow-moving and subtle film.  It's about a woman experiencing the ""real world"" for the very first time.

The friendly neighborhood psychologist wants to observe her in a lab while the gentle country doctor wants to go all Gorillas in the Mist and observe her bathing in her own filth in the woods.

It closes with Nell having a picnic, playing ring around the rosie with a little girl, a dead raccoon (named UUURGH GO BAH-GNNN!!), and her twin sister's femur.

If you want to know what ""putting a soul into the role"" means, that's the exact case. She is almost always impressive, but this is a performance that you will remember for the rest of your life once you see it.  The interesting plot keeps you stuck to the screen.  Nell is a girl, who has been brought up in an isolated world.  She never knew anyone except her mother and her twin sister.  The remote forests of North Carolina have always been her home. The movie is very beautifully shot, with a lot of fantastic sceneries.  Liam Neeson is another powerful point of ""Nell"".  One of the best movies of the 90's.

659272,2,6303467717,"To cast the part of Nell Carter with Jodie Foster as a white, babbling she-hermit is at best, uninformed, and at worst, highly offensive.

Nell Carter was none of these things. She had a beautiful singing voice and had an incredible acting talent. She was most certainly not a mildly retarded mountain woman. Nell Carter, in fact has never been to the woods, back or otherwise.

Also, despite what the film would have you believe,  Nell Carter was not an vehement  anti-Semite and never  once showed up intoxicated to a child's birthday party, nor did she ever refer to a street musician as a ""faggoty Chinaman.""

Also, I'm not sure if Bill Paxton was ever dishonorably discharged from the United States Air Force for eating, digesting and passing an entire B-36 bomber in a single day, as the movie claims.  I'm pretty sure he didn't invent breast cancer and prison rape either.

The scene in which Liam Neeson's character is replaced with Leslie Nielsen seemed like an unnecessary last minute choice, however, the decision to have him murder and disembowel a clown in front of a group of screaming children was one of the most transcendent in modern cinema.

It demonstrates through the character of Nell the fact that the world is completely ours to make, just as Nell and her family made and lived their own unique world all alone in the isolated cabin in the wilderness.

Some people might not realize the inherent legitimacy of Nell's and her mother's shared language.

So, her mother dies, as does her sister, and she is discovered by the grocery delivery guy who has to ride a bicycle out to the cabin.

At one point Nell is in some type of court that's going to decide what to do with her because officially she doesn't exist and so fourth, she's still learning to speak english, and she starts airing things that she finds wrong with modern american society, and she points out the general lack of eye contact between people.

Yes, the movie is ""good.""  Yes, Jodie Foster is excellent (as usual).

Suddenly she wasn't scared or nervous?  On the other hand ... it can be argued that at that very moment her whole life suddenly made sense and her plight became clear.

Perhaps the movie, like MANY others, was made so that the viewer can dream up their own interpretation about what REALLY was going on.

Jodie Foster received her third Best Actress Oscar nomination for this 1994 performance.  If she had won--and many believed she was going to because it was anybody's game in 94--it would have been her third win in less than 10 years, which is TERRIBLY unprecedented.

659424,3,6303467717,"One would expect more from Michael Apted than this award hopeful because thematically it's hard not to notice its glaring overlaps with Wild Child or The Elephant Man, its narrative following a tediously hackneyed routine --

Civilization discovers Outsider (in our case, a Tarzan-like girl born and brought up in the idyllic North Carolina wilderness); Outsider cannot communicate, speaks in a baroque forest tongue instead; Outsider is taunted, tested, taken advantage of, yet somehow becomes a media sensation and eventually teaches us Grave Important Things.

Woven into this predictable tapestry are some choice inanities.

The two physicians --

(1) A country doctor (Liam Neeson) conveniently oblivious to life's necessities like paying bills, and
(2) An institutionally-funded but vacuous shrink (Natasha Richardson) intent on furthering her career by examining Nell through two-way mirrors

-- find themselves transformed by the girl's gump-like innocence, realizing in the process the emptiness of their own lives. They need companionship. They need be one with nature. Why not swim in the lake nude under the evening stars, and while you're at it, why not show Nell her first glimpse of male genitalia so she'll no longer be scared of men?

Soon, it becomes clear that Nell is ironically the sanest of the three. When they step out of their contended cove into the civilized world (read: a small redneck town) the movie sinks into the labored and sappy. An unbelievable scene toward the end even has Nell defending herself in the courtroom, despite her linguistic stupor through the rest of the film.

In all fairness, Jodie Foster is borderline convincing in the bravura title role, and Neeson has his moments. It is these spurts of good acting that help camouflage the narrative's weaknesses somewhat, relying copiously on Spinotti's ravishing cinematography to fill in some logical lapses with rose-colored morning mountains and silvered moonlit lakes.

Yet, ultimately, I found myself asking the question, ""Haven't I seen this all before?"", the answer to which was a disappointing, resounding yes.",1100908800,8,2112,5.359516616314199

659428,5,6303467717,"While Hollywood is filled with movie stars, it can boast of only a scant few bona fide actresses.  Jodie Foster, the consummate professional, is the cream of that small crop, and I respect no other actor or actress on earth as much as I respect her.  Nell is a testament to her unlimited talent as well as her unmatched commitment to what she does.  The character of Nell is a role most actresses would never consider taking; it's a far too difficult challenge to meet for a film that holds little promise to bring in money hand over fist.  For Jodie Foster, though, what matters is the story to be told, not the glamour or the projected box office receipts.  She gives an absolutely amazing performance in this film, one that has deserved far more attention than it has received; as I write this, there is not even a DVD version of the film available.  If Nell is mentioned at all, it is almost always in reference to Jodie's Foster nudity in the film, and I would like to say straight out that her nudity is very tastefully done, important if not absolutely necessary for the story, and in no way provocative.
Nell is a poignant, emotional drama that saddens as well as inspires you; it is the kind of tearjerker in which your tears of empathy and concern are accented by a smile and sense of heartwarming joy.  The story is set deep in the wilderness of western North Carolina, where an old woman has lived for years all by herself.  People always thought she lived alone, at least, until she died and the local doctor discovered a pitiful woman-child hiding inside the shack, the only home she had ever known.  Nell's mother had suffered a stroke many years earlier and spoke with a pronounced speech impediment; as a result, Nell speaks a tongue that is almost completely foreign to both the local doctor and the psychiatric professional he calls in from Charlotte.  Dr. Lovell (Liam Neeson) becomes a guardian angel of sorts to Nell, fighting the courts and the mental health professionals to keep Nell in her native environment as opposed to being stuck in some institution where she will be treated as a lab subject.  He gets three months to work with Nell himself, and his potential foe in the form of psychologist Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson) becomes his ally in time, as they both work with Nell to learn her unique language and prepare her for a life completely unlike that which she has always known.  In her own special way, Nell helps the two doctors as much as they help her, yet their ability to protect her from a dire future of lonely clinical existence remains in doubt up until the very end.
Neeson and Richardson are wonderful in their roles, but Jodie Foster is simply amazing.  She had to learn a completely new, invented language as well as adopt a wide range of meaningful facial and body expressions and unique mannerisms in order to portray this ""wild child"" as a very real, very human individual.  Nell is easily one of Foster's most impressive performances, and how she did not win an Oscar for this role is beyond me.  It should also be noted that Foster produced as well as starred in this unforgettable film.  The scenery, I might add in closing, is also spectacular.  Filmed largely in the Nantahala National Forest in Graham County, North Carolina, a location just west of my own home, Nell is a beautiful sight to behold in more ways than one.  Hollywood needs more powerful, moving films such as this.",1055548800,132,3442,4.60556464811784
659480,5,6303467717,"This movie was beautiful to me because it brings messages that speak to a certain group of people. Individuals that look for something ""funny"" in those that are different (""funny"" as in to make fun of rather than laughing because something is humorous) won't get the message. If you sometimes wonder if this life is all there is, Nell might have a lot of inspiring notions for you.
No, it's not an entirely perfect movie. I would have liked having some more details regarding May, and perhaps a little more background on the mother. However, if you think it was a flop then I'd like to see you take this subject matter and improve on it. The language in itself was pulled off beyond belief. I thought it was dramatically brilliant. Jodie Foster is amazing and exceptionally believable.
I disagree with some comments I see here regarding the final speech. I think that her more ""educated"" sounding phrasing in the courtroom show that Nell is learning from what's going on around her, and that's entirely believable. Just because she was in a trancelike state doesn't mean she wasn't taking things in prior to the court session. She's not a dumb girl at all, and I thought her deep hearted message proved that she is not autistic or retarded. Think about it. She's like a blank canvas. If you can't believe that something like that can happen, then I haven't any way to convince you. I believe it can.

659481,5,6303467717,"In ""Nell,"" Jodie Foster wows us, as usual, with a deeply felt, passionate performance.  She is Nell, the ""wild child"" daughter of a backwoods aphasic hermit woman, who raised her all alone with no human contact.  Nell's speech is all her own -- it is a striking combination of a private language she had once shared with her deceased identical twin sister, and an imitation of her mother's speech.  Her mother, as I mentioned earlier, had aphasia, which includes major speech processing problems.  Nell's speech was the basis for the title of the play upon which this film was based -- ""Idioglossia.""  (I believe, for anyone out there who's into things like this, that the correct term would have been ""idiolect,"" as the term for a language spoken by only one person.)  Natasha Richardson and Liam Neeson bring constant love and warmth to Nell, and to the film, as medical/social-work professionals who attempt to break through to Nell by trying to learn her language.  In the background lurk The Media, and The Scientific Establishment, both of which threaten at any moment to swoop in and make Nell's life miserable.  The film builds to a heartrending and passionate, albeit rather unrealistic, courtroom self-defence speech by Nell, in which she calls the precepts of modern civilization itself into question.
Liam Neeson's performance is described by one of the editorial reviewers on this page as being ""at his teddy bear best.""  I think that sounds slightly emasculating -- he put more positive, warm energy into this film than many actors project in their entire careers.  Show some appreciation!  Come on!
Anyone who enjoys this film should also be told about ""Wild Child,"" a Francois Truffaut film that deals, through decidedly less rose-colored glasses, with a true story that was very similar to this one.  Another film that has certain parallel resonances, in the sense of a ""freakish"" individual seeking a chance to be themself in the face of major obstacles coming from the scientific establishment, is ""Charlie,"" starring Cliff Robertson and Claire Bloom.
I thought about giving this movie four stars, only because it puts Nell in the rather unrealistic position of delivering a profound courtroom speech.  I decided to go with five, however, because the basic energy of the movie is so terrific.  Absolutely worth checking out.",989625600,44,2343,5.0519480519480515
659482,3,6303467717,"This 1994 film stars Jodie Foster as Nell, a young woman living alone in a remote area of North Carolina.  She seems retarded at first until we realize that her mother was a stroke victim and she experienced an emotional trauma in childhood.  This has resulted with her developing her own private language. When the good doctor played by Liam Neeson discovers her, he wants to keep her from the psychologists who want to hospitalize and study her. The court gives him three months to observe her in the wild, and he is joined by Natasha Richardson, a graduate psychology student, to do this observation.
Jodie Foster's performance is outstanding.  The audience cannot understand her language but her emotions are clear.  As the film evolves, however,  we do understand some of her words as she gradually learns to speak English. There's a subplot of a romance between the doctor and the psychology student and a few bad guys including a journalist who wants to expose her to the world.  And yes, the cinematography is fine.
However, the story does not ring true, not one bit.  There are too many holes in the plot and a contrived silly ending.  Specifically, we never understand how Nell manages to survive.  We see her dancing naked in the moonlight but never see her looking for food or chopping wood or doing any of the thousands of things necessary to live all alone in a rural area.

The eleven  year-old who would play with dolls, or would rather paint than study math,  or would do a Nell's dance at a family get-together - all feel our need to  make them grow up, to be interested in important endeavors like, maybe,  school achievement, team sports, life goals, and, naturally, repressing  impulsive behaviors (you might check out the character of twelve year-old  Elsie in ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"". Now, as then, she would be  expected to put away childish things).
As to the movie, I don't think  it's a spoiler to say I think the high point of the movie wasn't the  courtroom scene. I think the story turned on the moment Paula (Natasha  Richardson) found solace in Nell's hands, when Nell was no longer a  subject, but a needed co-human.
I thought ""Nell"" was a well  produced, directed, and acted movie. Jodie Foster, Liam Neeson, Natasha  Richardson and the rest of the cast were outstanding. Of special note, I  think Nick Searce, as the sheriff, gave his character real depth in a  beautifully nuanced and layered performance.

Which  was really beautiful. I have to cut this short a bit. So I'll just say, it  was a terrific movie and kills me that I lost my own copy. It's somehwre in  the house. I just need to look for it.",963273600,,561,4.46078431372549
659487,5,6303467717,"Here is the quintessential film for all devoted Jodiephiles, for the rest of you, it is just OK.  Being a devoted fan, I loved this film and feel it is a must see, for those of us who love Ms. Foster.  Sure there are  continuity problems, some suspension of disbelief is required here, but all  in all it is the bare essence of Fosters performance, and her wonderful  accent, and her sincerity that make this film special. She really, really  believes this and so do the devoted.  The nonbelievers, the infidelis will  scoff, but true members of the ""Church of Jodie Foster"" will  shout it's praises.  I did.",961372800,3,608,4.546296296296297
659488,2,6303467717,"Nell is an earnest and slightly soporific drama about a doctor's inadvertant discovery of a wild child in the remote hills of North Carolina.  Jerry Lovell (Liam Neeson), a rural MD is dispatched to confirm  the death of a hermit-like mountain lady and is quick to discover a  cantankerous, violent, and unintelligible young woman, obviously the old  woman's unacknowledged daughter,hiding in the cabin rafters. Lovell is  immediately captivated by Nell (Jodie Foster) and is soon joined by  career-climbing psychologist Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson) in  attempting to decode the mysterious woman's gibberish-filled rages. Before  you can say ""Wapner at 5:30,"" this hillbilly rain woman's past  becomes brutally clear: her mother, a victim of rape in her youth, had  given birth to the child but kept her a secret from the the world for  thirty years; Nell has been taught that men and daylight are harmful, and  her language is the product of imitation after her mother's stroke.
The  sentiment here is laid on thick. Nell is harrassed by those stereotypical  movie rejects, scientists and red necks. The scientists want her brought in  for study; the red necks want to play a little doctor (Can you say  Deliverance?) There are a number of nice scenes portraying the bonding  between the three leads, and the direction by the talented Michael Apted is  sensitive and well-intentioned, but Nell suffers by asking us to shed too  many unearned tears. In this regard, most damaging is the lack of key  exposition. We never really get to know Nell. Her mystery, while at first  quite interesting, loses its novelty by the time they take the wide-eyed  country girl to the big bad city.
The biggest roadblock has to be Jodie  Foster. Her pagan-like emoting as she dances naked through the woods is two  stations short of hamville. It's like she wants us to believe so  desperately in Nell's tragic story that she has to use a few neon signs to  show us the way. Thanks, but I think we can handle it ourselves. Neeson is  more effective, and he and real-life wife Richardson do a nice job of  counterbalancing Foster's excess in the role of Nell's surrogate ma and pa.",958089600,16,2167,4.895316804407713
659489,4,6303467717,"All I have to say is that this is another movie in which Jodie proves to us that she's THE perfect acting machine! The movie itself is okay/good, but the unforgettable performance that Miss Foster gave made the movie  better than if it would have been another actress instead of her playing  the demanding and complex character of Nell.",950572800,4,336,4.677966101694915
