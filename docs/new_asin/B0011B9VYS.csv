8241265,1,B0011B9VYS,"Just finished watching ""Darker Secrets - Sideline Secrets 2"" released by Ariztical Entertainment.
""Sideline Secrets"" was such a hot mess of outlandishness that helped to entice anybody who was watching it to watch just a minute more to see what happened next.  I gave ""Sideline Secrets"" a two star review simply because it was hysterically funny to watch with one over-the-top scene after another.  I strongly suspect that  ""Darker Secrets - Sideline Secrets 2""  was made to cash in on the nearly cult status of the first one, which I suspect was a bit of an unexpected hit for the producers who made it..
For those who didn't see the first movie, Detective Cunningham and Dr. Tyler, who were running their very own sexual slavery ring by videotaping young men in compromising positions on betamax video killed each other at the end of the first movie.
Interested in finding all of Dr. Tyler's and Detective Cunningham's victims, the police department assigns Peter -  a young gay police offer to watch all those betamax videos and compile a report - why someone who wasn't experienced in investigating sexual crimes isn't put in charge of this investigation is never really explained in this movie.
Spoilers Ahead - Peter is in love with Todd - a straight actor who has just been cast in the lead of his  own television show.  As Peter continues to watch those video tapes, he descends into moral corruptness and hatches a plan to blackmail Todd into having sex with him; and expands the plan to ensnare his fellow straight police officers.
In perhaps homage to the first movie, this one ends with Peter waiting in the shower doing a rather spot on impersonation of Norman Bates - Psycho - as he waits to rape his next blackmail victim.  [If you're forcing someone to have sex with you - you're raping them.]
So coupled with a bad plot and equally bad acting:
STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED!
HALF-OF-A-STAR!

[Note:  Sideline Secrets 3 was apparently never made.  If it ever does, it should start with a police officer investigating why Peter was murdered, paralleling an investigation done by an investigative news reporter looking into the same crime.  I will take story credit and a cut of the profits of DVD sales.]",1434153600,,2214,4.7973684210526315
8241266,1,B0011B9VYS,I guess even the worst movies need to get at least one star. This then is one of the worst movies. All bad and not in a good way.,1394496000,,129,3.4827586206896552
8241267,1,B0011B9VYS,The only person in this film who seemed to be putting any real effort into their belief and commitment to the project was Tim Garrett.  Everyone else pales in comparison.,1390176000,,170,4.666666666666667
8241268,3,B0011B9VYS,"This sequel to Sideline Secrets is hardly a disappointment, considering how bad the original film was. The acting is no better, the script is worse, the sound quality is abominable, and the photographer forgot to bring his seeing eye dog to work. On the plus side, there are a few attractive guys in this film. Something the original totally lacked. And since this is supposed to be a soft porn film, it's good to have something worth watching. But don't count on hearing their badly written and delivered lines, because most of them are either mumbled, muffled or muffed. The rest are drowned out by a sound track that seems more daytime soap opera than murder mystery/porn film.

Darker Secrets 2 is shameful on so many levels. Too bad it's not sexy enough to be a guilty pleasure. Don't bother buying it.",1265500800,3,807,4.683098591549296
8241269,2,B0011B9VYS,"this is a sequel!  if you remember, the lead in this movie was a non speaking role in the 1st.  he was in the dream sequence in the park!
now, in this role he is a police officer! wow!
the acting is better than in the first, believe it or not!
still not that great!",1216080000,3,265,3.8
8241270,3,B0011B9VYS,"Traffic cop Peter Jameson (Rick Bolander) has been given the task of going through the videotapes of blackmailer psychiatrist Dr. Kirk Tyler (shown in ""Sideline Secrets"") to find clues for missing porn star Matthew Strom (Curtis Ray Husted).  These videotapes contain a number of graphic scenes, all shown.  As Peter watches these videotapes, some ideas come to mind on how to handle some of his own issues.

Peter's straight roommate Todd Hewitt (David Beutler) is in the cast of a TV pilot whose series has been picked up by a network.  Todd is moving up and is apt to move out to his own quarters.  Gay Peter has had his eye on Todd and doesn't want him to go just yet.  Gay Jeremy (Tim Garrett) wants more than Peter does out of their friendship.  Peter's straight former heart-throb Lonnie (Ryan Lynn) wants to move in if Todd moves out.  How to manage all of this?

A first pass through the film produces some feelings of confusion.  The first image, Peter watching a key videotape, comes from late in the action.  The film kicks into a flashback that catches up with the initial image almost an hour later.  Other than videotaped evidence, the film's chronological start is the playing of a clip showing Todd having a truncated role in a show.  Then after discussion and some background, the ""Darker Secrets"" shows Todd starting the fateful last box of videotapes.  The use of videotapes, dreams, and montages may initially disguise and distract from the structure, which is actually rather straightforward.  A second viewing should make complete sense and reveals that the editing is actually rather good.

One should acknowledge the many attractive bodies, ten of which provide full-frontal views and six of which provide substantial ones, do cause one not to dwell too much about the story line for the first 2/3 of the film.  Given that my version clocks in at 69 minutes, this suggests that the characters do not spend much time explaining the situation, the personalities, or the relationships.  The viewer is given enough through the dialogue and actors' choices that the story is clear.

The movie serves its purpose well.  If it wanted to do a bit better, it would spend more time on the protagonist, showing more details of his psychological transition.  The direction, editing, and camerawork are good.  The acting was variable.  The budget was $18,000 (per IMDB).  For soft-core, the sex was excellent.  ""Darker Secrets"" may not enlighten, but it does entertain.",1209600000,6,2481,4.892086330935252
