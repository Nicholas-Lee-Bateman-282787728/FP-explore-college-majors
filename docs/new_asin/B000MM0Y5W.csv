I enjoyed seeing these characters tackle and argue the subject of relationships and love. Most of all Ghoulee is truly a lovable creature, if I've ever seen one! The fantasy and lore of this story takes you ""far away"" yet the narrative content is something I'm sure most people can relate to and is so contemporary its hilarious! Love, attraction, affection, loneliness these characters touch on all of it. Valentine's Day Refugees was indeed a delightful sort of spiritual comedy unlike any other with some amazingly true messages you don't see too often now a days. It is a movie for the young and old and can be shared by the entire family.""",1177200000,,767,4.688888888888889

This is a comedy about some zany characters served a la ""Munsters"" or ""Addams Family"" and their quest for romance. The cheaters, the desperate, the lonely and the successful.

The question is raised: Is romance really that difficult to find? Or do we have to redefine what we perceive as the ultimate ""love connection?"" This movie gives its own unique perspective on the so-called ""meaning of Valentine's Day"" right behind the ""meaning of Christmas."" A classic line was delivered on December 26th by the teen character Trinity when she said, ""It's time to replace the Baby Jesus for the Baby Cupid."" All done in good taste, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This movie is bound to be an instant Valentine classic for everyone whether they celebrate Valentine's Day or not!",1177113600,2,869,4.748344370860927
