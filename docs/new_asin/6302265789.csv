Despite the title, the Harem appears only briefly. Tape quality on my copy was poorer than average, having a 'washed out' appearance but it transferred to DVD.

7823163,5,6302265789,"Lost In A Harem is one of the best Abbott & Costello films for 3 reasons:  One, unlike most of their films in the 1940s which were produced at Universal Studios (and available on DVD in a Universal set), this one was done at MGM with that studios usual higher production standards, including a few spectacular musical numbers.  Two, it is one of only about a dozen filmed appearances of big band great Jimmmy Dorsey, who performs, with his band, a number called John Silver  (""15 men on a dead man's chest"") which I haven't found elsewhere, and a few other songs.  Three, the ""Pokomoko"" routine (""Slowwwwly I turned, step by step I crept upon him . . ."") is done to perfection by A&C with Murray Leonard as the Derelict, which I've always remebered as one of my favorite A&C routines since I was 10 years old.  Furthermore, there's a real live giant (Lock Martin), full costumes and exotic sets as you would expect from MGM, a magic skit by A&C, hypnotism, a fine performance from Douglas Dumbrille as the bad guy, and more good music.  I would rate it below Abott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, In The Navy, In Society, The Naughty Nineties, and perhaps 3 or 4 others, but definitely in their top ten or twelve.  But since it's not in the Universal set, it's not available on DVD anywhere.",1127520000,2,1289,4.506437768240343
7823164,3,6302265789,"Not one of Abbott & Costello's best works.  Costello has some funny bits but overall I was rather unimpressed with this one.  Don't get me wrong the movie is definitly watchable and has some very funny scenes but it just doesn't compare to some of the other work they put out around this same time.  There are much better works to choose from ""Time Of Their Lives"", ""Hold That Ghost"" & ""Rio Rita"" to name a few.",1071878400,,411,4.311688311688312
7823165,5,6302265789,"If yo like Abbott and Costello, this is your movie.  Overlooked by many, it is funnier than Buck Privates with many of the great A&C routines used to great advantage.  A truly memorable comic masterpiece.",1020816000,3,204,4.8
