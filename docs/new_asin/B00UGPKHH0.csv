8705795,5,B00UGPKHH0,"High Anxiety is a very fine movie about a eminent psychiatrist Doctor Richard Thorndike (Mel Brooks) who is brought in to take over the prestigious private mental institution named, ""THE PSYCHO NEUROTIC INSTITUTE FOR THE VERY, VERY NERVOUS!"" after the mysterious death of former head Dr. Ashley. Well Doctor Thorndike's accent to the head of the institute was both unexpected and unwelcome.  The true joy of the video is how all these issues play out. I could share the storyline with you but I won't suffice to say a very complex web of intrigue unfurls where a host of really odd characters come into play. The comedy is at times over the top and is a parody of many classic Alfred Hitchcock films.

Many would suggest this was not Mel Brooks best outing but, I'd beg to differ since High Anxiety was both fun and funny. High Anxiety does not have the cult following of Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein but, is worthy of love in its own right. The comedy has aged pretty well considering when it was made. Unfortunately there were many different versions of High Anxiety and the enjoyment factor is better or worse depending on which version you get.

Generally the heavily censored version gets rid of some mild cursing that really takes away from the adult experience of the humor.  The absolute best version of High Anxiety includes an executive dinning room scene where doctor Montique rushes down the stairs to the dinning room just in time to see his beautiful container of fruit cup taken away. You see fruit cup is served promptly at 6:30 pm and he is 30 SECONDS LATE! The killer funny part comes when another doctor enjoying HIS fruit cup, Dr. Montique the fruit cup is especially good tonight, he continues in smug tones, ""ALL FRESH NOTHING CANNED!"" Then a fast cut scene with a close up of Nurse Diesel taunting poor Dr Montique! Everything that does not include the scenes I reference above are lesser versions.

High Anxiety is one of my all time favorite movies. Dr. Richard Harpo Thorndike was my hero. Thank you Mr. Brooks for bringing him to life in this fine DVD!",1514246400,,2088,4.678474114441417
