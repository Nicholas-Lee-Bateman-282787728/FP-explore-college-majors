8352212,4,B00266X47W,I'm glad I watched this new DVD on Barack Obama's campaign as I learned a great deal about the different grassroots and social networking techniques that were used. This DVD was definitely different from others out there that just focus on Obama's life. You felt like you were a part of the campaign from day one and it made you realize how many different people got involved. This DVD is definitely inspiring!,1245801600,3,410,4.708333333333333
