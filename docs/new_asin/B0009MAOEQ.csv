2299651,5,B0009MAOEQ,"I have studied this show, although that it is a cartoon, which would make most adults ignore it, it has to do with advanced calculations and programming beyond normal comprehension. Programming into a computer, turning a real world person, and transferring him/her inside of a supercomputer virus (X.A.N.A.) running parallel to the human world, which could infect and kill humans. Once you get into this, it is a pretty good show.",1127001600,7,430,5.070422535211268
2299652,3,B0009MAOEQ,"My younger sisters watched Code Lyoko religiously when it first aired on Cartoon Network, and I find that I am just as delighted as they are now that it has returned from its hiatus. While certainly not a pinnacle of modern animation, the dialogue and artwork is far better than many other newer cartoons shown on CN, Nickelodeon, and the various Disney channels. For those who plan on buying this for their children, I can assure you that this isn't a series that will annoy you to death with a meaningless plot and shallow characters. You might even enjoy watching it with your kids.

Also, in response to the reviewer who complained about the dubbing, it certainly wasn't ""in Japanese first."" Code Lyoko is actually a French series that has been dubbed into English for U.S. viewers. While the drawing style used is very anime-esque, the series itself isn't technically anime, though the word ""anime"" itself is arguably French in origin. If you visit the show's website, you will find that it has two sections: one in English, the other in French. Japanese isn't mentioned at all.",1126051200,13,1083,4.791443850267379
2299653,5,B0009MAOEQ,"I'm 28 and have two kids, one of which is 5 and we BOTH LOVE Code Lyoko!  IT ROCKS!!  I will definitely be buying this when it comes out!",1124928000,10,137,3.689655172413793
2299654,5,B0009MAOEQ,"This is an awesome show.  I'm not really even a kid anymore and I can watch this show for hours.  It's well worth the investment, would give more than 5 stars if possible.",1302307200,,171,4.151515151515151
2299655,5,B0009MAOEQ,"The description of the dvd makes it appear that the episodes were from one season in sequential order, which they were not. Other than that, this is a quite enjoyable dvd with several extras, and good quality video and audio!",1288483200,,225,4.65
2299656,4,B0009MAOEQ,"I ADORE this show. Code Lyoko is originally a French cartoon, and I was so happy to find it was America so I could listen to it in English! I've been watching it since I was 10 (I am 14 now). It's an amazing show with so much energy and great characters with their strengths and weaknesses. It appeals to both girls and boys by having relationship troubles, and LOTS of action. I am girl, and I actually watch the show for when they fight in the video game!! I enjoy Japanese animation, and this has a Japanese feel to it. The character designs are very appealing to me and each character is unique. There aren't any secondary characters that look the same. Each has a different flavor.

I would rate this show 4/5 because it has an amazing (original) story-line, beautiful designs, and really great actors in both the English and French version!!

Anyone can enjoy this show if they give it a chance!",1282435200,,901,4.454545454545454
2299657,5,B0009MAOEQ,"Code LYOJO is the most surprising anime series to hit the arwaves in a long time,The fact that it was made in France is equally surprising,imagine it the French have done something really cool rather than say """"I surrender!""(W.W.II)It looks japanese it's got a character who transferred fron Japan(Yumi)but it's from France!!! Whodathunkit!",1181088000,,340,5.433962264150943
2299658,5,B0009MAOEQ,"Product as promised, super cool series both my children love.

Thanks!",1163203200,,70,5.363636363636363
2299659,5,B0009MAOEQ,"First off, let me start out by saying that I am 18 years old and yes, I absolutely LOVE this series. Now I must admit, when I first saw it I was too fond of it. However, I was attracted to the combination of animation styles that repressent the ""real world"" and Lyoko, and the theme song. (Probably the best theme song I have ever heard)

So, I continued to watch the series and began to fall in love with it. It's got lovable characters and interesting plot lines. People say that it's repetitive. I really don't agree. Yes, sometimes the same template is used (XANA attacks, one of the group members stay behind to occupy his attention, others to go Lyoko, Aelita deactivates the tower at the last possible second before the other team member is killed, launch a return to the past), but I never found it to get old.

And then in the Second Season, that ""template"" is hardly ever used seeing that a whole new plotline is introduced.

As far as the ""horrible dubbing"", it's not horrible. It's pretty good. I've watched the original French versions of the show and sometimes the voice overs were worse than the english ones. But lets face it...this is animation, not a real life drama. Of course the dubbing isn't going to always be exact!

And as far as ""sterotypical characters"" go, that's not prevelant in the show. Sure, you do have the snobby diva of the school (""Sissy"") and the genuis (Jeremie), but what is so sterotypical about a virtual girl (Aelita)? Yumi is a Japanese girl who is just herself. I mean, sometimes characters like to ""put on"" a face which makes them seem different. Yumi doesn't. She seems quite comfortable with herself and really doesn't fit a sterotype . Ulrich is the same way. So is Odd (who yes, is kind of odd).

This show was aimed at pre-teens but there are many adults and teenages who love the show. This show has everything! From drama to comedy to action and adventure to romance. Top that off with enjoyable characters, awesome storylines, and a virtual world! Well it makes for such a great watch!",1148860800,5,2039,4.544959128065395

2299661,4,B0009MAOEQ,The Code Lyoko Vol. 1 DVD was great. I like the shows on there. It was a great buy!,1140739200,2,83,3.4210526315789473
2299662,5,B0009MAOEQ,"I'm 64. My 6 year old granddaughter adores Code Lyoko. She likes cartoons in general, but nothing comes close to Code Lyoko. I like to watch it with her because I love the beauty of the drawing/animation. I find the plot sort of simple and repetetive, but my granddaughter loves it, it's just complex enough to excite her. She can tell you the whole history behind the stories, and knows exactly what's going on in each episode. I love sharing it with her because I love her! (I just read in these reviews that someone doesn't like the dubbing. Who cares about dubbing when they are cartoon figures!!!) I'm going to buy season 2 for her first: Xana unleashed, which she asked for - right now!",1137024000,6,692,4.5
2299663,4,B0009MAOEQ,"Don't get me wrong, Code Lyoko is a really cool show, which is why I picked up this volume, as well as the second, and plan to get the third. But what I don't understand is why they aren't releasing the episodes in their proper order - Volume 1, for example, has, respectively, episodes 21, 5, 3, and 16, with episode 1 thrown in merely as a bonus. The show is largely episodic, true, but there is also an overarching plot throughout the season, which can't hope to be understood if the episodes are viewed out of sequence.",1136851200,2,523,4.346938775510204
2299664,5,B0009MAOEQ,"Code: Lyoko is a very interisting Show. Yea, I won't call the best anime

of all times, but I give it good marks for Guts. It's different and it's got a

good Plot and thats all a show relly needs to starts off. The Show gets better

in the second season, but Season one is where it all starts. The Show is Funny,

it has lots of adventers, and deals with some problems kids can Identify with.

All in all it's slow and great start to a great show.

I suggest it for any kids 10 or older.",1136764800,,488,3.9285714285714284

2299666,5,B0009MAOEQ,"This DVD has the following 5 episodes from season one:  Zero Gravity Zone, Big Bug, Holiday in the Fog, Claustrophobia, and Teddygozilla.  It also has a video with the entire theme song in English, and the identical video with the entire song in French.  It has ""holomaps"", which are maps of all of the towers.  If you click on a tower, it shows you a snippet of the tower as seen in an episode, and tells you the name of the episode.  All of the towers are named and numbered, I believe.

I'm a 44 year old mom with an 8 yr old boy and 5 yr old girl.  We love this show and we love the music.",1136073600,3,593,3.9745762711864407

2299668,1,B0009MAOEQ,"This has got to be the crappiest show I have ever seen.

Down with Anime. Down with poorly drawn characters. Down with crappy shows.

BAN THIS SHOW FROM EXISTENCE!",1134518400,4,163,4.586206896551724
2299669,5,B0009MAOEQ,"Before i start I'm going to say that im 17 and love this show. that might seem a little weird to some people, but hey I don't really care. This show is one of the best i have ever seen. The way they incorporate the kids normal lives into saving the world, and especially against a super computer in basically a game is nothing less then brilliance. as for the person that said stuff about the bad dubbing, if you only watched it for 5 minutes then you obviously have no idea what the show is about and you shouldn't jump to conclusions unless you are a moron.",1133740800,6,559,4.185185185185185
2299670,5,B0009MAOEQ,"Code Lyoko is a very different show. I think that all who say its a combination of other shows don't have a clue what they are talking about. There is something strange and fresh about this show it seems different form others and even though I'm not shure why, but one thing i know it that the characters are perfectly captured and impossibly life-like in every way. It is incredible how theese well rounded personalities seem to pop out. They have flaws of course just like every normal person. This is a incredible show. Here are my comments. A truly complex and detailed plot goes into work in this show basically revolving around four teen age children in a boarding school and a young ""human"" who is ""trapped"" in a world called lyoko. Lyoko originally planned as a digital paradise has a few major problems one of them is; the super ""calculator"" or computer has a minor, but uncorrectable glitch. The glitch cannot be fixed because all the scientists who worked on it ""mysteriously"" do not exist anymore. So the super ""calculator"" XANA in code name has a powerful glitch and has decided to claim freedom from those who created it ""humans"" and conquer or destroy the earth whichever comes first. Ulrich, Yumi, Odd, and Jeremie find this super ""calculator"" and the young teenager trapped within it Aelita. Aelita a complex and smart person keeps having strange visions about secrete service agents and others about her mysterious past. Well i have already said too much! It is a very good show with a complex plot that is made clearer in the second season. Too many complaints from people who didn't understand it i think. So I'm 14 years old and like this show allot; thanks for reading this i hope you buy this dvd set even if it doesn't include half the begging. PS: which i saw others might say you aren't missing much, but i don't because it can be hard to piece this show together. Oh and one outher thing i think although it may seem unlikely and kind-of like a fairy tale i think one thing that makes this show so captivateing is that it is the opposite when you really give it some thought. A virus will infect everything even the very thing that gave it birth. Anyways like i was saying before i don't want to write a book. I hope this helped you.",1130371200,4,2260,4.528117359413203

8063016,5,B0009MAOEQ,"The moment i saw it i became an instant fan of the series. I don't know who put that hateful review in the description but it is completely incorrect and biased. Code Lyoko is really good. I like the dub, i like the original characters (the moron said they werentl and apparently the concept of people looking dofferent in video games than in real life went over the guy's head. The entire plot was original too. I also don't get the impression it is trying to look like anime either as it is not even in the same art style and the characters don't fit in anime stereotypes but i personaly consider it right next to plenty of anime in my favorities.",1467849600,,649,4.327868852459017
