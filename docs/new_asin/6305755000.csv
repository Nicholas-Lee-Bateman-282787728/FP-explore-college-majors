It is a story of hopelessness, of a life without choices, of the powerlessness of the individual. At the same time, the choices Xiu Xiu made put her in the position she attained. She was blind to the love and friendship offered her by her companion in the wilderness, she remained vain and selfish to the end, and she chose the path that led to her ending. See this excellent film, see if you agree with me. This film was banned in China, as you can imagine. Yet it is a valuable film for the understanding of China and all she has endured.",1046476800,,717,4.318518518518519

Lost hope in humanity, and wanted to crawl  into a ditch and die....A very effective movie.  Made with a low budget and  without licence from the PRC govt we were told by Ms. Chen's stand-in.  Gutsy on Ms. Chen's part and worth it (some fantastic scenery of the  Tibetan steppes too)....Just have a Jim Carey to follow up or you'll be  ditch-bound too.",954288000,,519,4.688888888888889
