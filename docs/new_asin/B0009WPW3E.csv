I bought every volume.  Well worth the money, and now I can introduce it to my Grand daughter in a few years.",1196208000,,273,4.510204081632653

If you liked ""Anne of Green Gables"" or ""Little House on the Prairie""; then you should like this. Seasons 1-6 are excellent.

The realistic, likeable, characters are people that I would like to know. Avonlea is a place, I would like to visit. I like the beautiful, country-side, the farms, the horses, and the period style of dress, with the women in their pretty dresses, the period sets and homes, the humor, the warmth, the inviting activities, and the lively pace. Avonlea carries you to a nicer place.

Sullivan Entertainment spared no expense to create fun and interesting escapades.

I especially liked the episode where Aunt Hetty, Jasper, and Aunt Olivia purchase the Lobster Canning Factory; because Jasper and Olivia are such charming characters in figuring out how to improve the factory.

This series has been my best money value; dividing the 13-episodes by the cost: $5113 episodes = $3.92 per 46-minute episode. Sells new in Canada for $80.",1173830400,2,1012,5.0359281437125745
8068980,5,B0009WPW3E,"This great family-friendly series brings back great memories from my childhood; I would definitely consider this my favorite TV show of all time!  Each episode is full of sweet moments, family life, exciting adventures, beautiful scenery, and much more.  The content of these is minimal: it's a very family-friendly series, with only a few episodes with some objectionable content (like the Witches of Avonlea episode in the early Seasons).  Do yourself a favor and check out this amazing series produced by Sullivan in Canada, the same company who brought up ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" in the 90's with Megan Follows.  Enjoy these fantastic episodes again and again!

Sarah Stanley has blossomed into an independent and pretty young lady, but she still manages to get into trouble at times (imagine that with people like Felix, Gus and Felicity as your friends!). Season Five contains wonderful things like: Felix starting to become a man, Izzy beginning to grow into a pretty young lady, a furthering of Felicity and Gus's relationship, a happier and free-er Janet King, a change in little Cecily, a new love for Sarah, and much more!!

Season Five contains the following episodes:

-Fathers and Sons

-Memento Mori

-Modern Times

-A Friend in Need

-Stranger in the Night

-The Great Race

-Someone to Believe In

-Strictly Melodrama

-Thursday's Child

-Best Laid Plans

-Otherwise Engaged

-Enter Prince Charming

-The Minister's Wife",1119830400,21,1458,5.153846153846154
8068981,5,B0009WPW3E,"My wife and I have watched all the episodes and I can report that the picture and audio quality is superb. The packaging is excellent, too.

This is top-notch family entertainment, reminiscent of great shows from my childhood such as Little House On The Prairie and The Waltons.",1119398400,11,278,4.791666666666667
