1106281,5,6549303141,"A group of students from the School of Visual Arts got access to several days on the set of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead and a documentary took shape.  Largely intended to be shown to film students as an educational tool in preparing them for the business side of film production, the movie also is a wonderful showcase of writer/director George A. Romero's fierce independent streak and unique handling of the genre.  Those just wanting to see Romero showing zombies where to stand or Savini doing his stuff had better stick to the DVD extras on Day of the Dead (or the upcoming multi-disc edition of Dawn that Anchor Bay is putting together), for this documentary is more studious of the man's artistic intent and the nature of independent movie making itself.  For serious fans of Romero, however, this is an essential annotation to the Dead trilogy.  Highest recommendation.",1078012800,5,885,4.841059602649007
1106282,4,6549303141,"In 1978, film professor/filmmaker Roy Frumkes wrote, produced & directed Document of the Dead chronicaling indepedent filmmaker George A. Romero.  Filmed over one long weekend on the set of Dawn of the Dead, Frumkes conducts interviews with various members of the cast and crew, including Romero himself.  Mixed with footage from Night of the Living Dead, Martin, Romero's modern-day vampire film, and Dawn of the Dead, the documentary tells it's own story concerning a little guy fighting the system.  The little guy being Romero and the system being the modern film industry.
Simply put, this is one of the best documentaries concerning filmmaking.  Going from pre-production to distribution, Document of the Dead covers all the grounds that Romero went through in order to get Dawn of the Dead on the silver screen.  It's a treat particularly for Dawn fans being that it contains scenes not seen in any version of Dawn of the Dead and the now-legendary alternate ending is addressed.  Also worth mentioning is Make-up Effects Artist/Stunt Cordinator/Actor Tom Savini at work creating zombies out of filmmaker Frumkes and his then-girlfriend.
My main complaint is the 4th Act/""10 Years Later..."" segment shot on the set of Two Evil Eyes.  The documentary was just fine chronicaling the first 10 years of Romero's career.  Though, the footage/interviews aren't bad in any manner, the documentary worked better concerning Romero's attempts to make his films his way in Pittsburgh during the 1970s.  Once the main story arc (Romero fighting for his cut of Dawn of the Dead for U.S. theatres and succedding with the film becoming a critical/commercial success!) ends, there's nowhere else to go.  I can't help but give a little complaint with the lack of any mention towards Romero's post-Dawn films such as Knightriders, Creepshow, and Day of the Dead.
In the Bonus Materials for the dvd, there's a commentary track with Frumkes and other members of the crew.  Frumkes is nice, professional and has only kind things to say about Romero, Savini & the other people he was around while making Document. He's certainly a major film fan.  It's full of facts and fun antedotes from the set.  Well-worth a listen!  Also there's deleted footage from the original cut of Document shot on the Dawn set and unused interviews from the ""10 Years Later..."" segment.
All that aside, Document of the Dead is worth seeing if you're a fan of the horror genre, George A. Romero, or just films in general.",1059350400,3,2484,5.012165450121654
1106283,4,6549303141,"As a documentary, this film could have been a bit better.  But as a companion to Dawn of the Dead, this is excellent stuff.  The film offers plenty of behind-the-scenes material in the Monroeville Mall.  One is able to see this incredible space transformed into one of the great film sets of all time.  There are also interviews with cast members and with Tom Savini as well, not to mention Savini diving from the balcony in his death-stunt.  Document of the Dead also goes into other Romero films with behind-the-scenes and other business bits like distribution, etc.  However, there is quite a bit of Dawn material here, making this essential for the die-hard fan.",993600000,8,666,4.798245614035087
1106284,5,6549303141,"This has to be one of the most thorough documentaries ever made about flimaking, independent or otherwise. It covers every facet involved; pre-production, scriptwriting, casting, storyboarding, production, post production, editing, distribution. It has interesting interviews with Romero, (producer) Richard Rubinstein, special effects artist/actor/stuntman Tom Savivi, several cast and crew members, and clips from Romero's two hour forty five minute version of Dawn Of The Dead which include some alternate footage not seen on the U.S. theatrical release. All interspersed with scenes from Night Of The Living Dead, Martin, and the Calgon commercial spoof on Fantastic Voyage.
There is also a segment on Two Evil Eyes which reunites Romero and Frumkes. It focuses on a special effects segment detailing on what can go wrong in movie making usually does. Quite effective.
The DVD supplements feature a fascinating audio commentary with director Frumkes, cinematographer Reeves Lehmann, and narrator Nicole Potter, with lots of anecdotes, including a very sad one detailing the lost alternate ending of the original cut of Dawn Of The Dead. There are also seven minutes of deleted footage from the original documentary, plus a twenty minute interview segment from Two Evil Eyes with Adrienne Barbeau, George Romero, and Tom Savini.
Required viewing for future filmakers and, of course, fans of Dawn Of The Dead, George Romero, and Roy Frumkes.
A job well done.",992304000,6,1460,5.522321428571429
1106285,1,6549303141,"Im a HUGE fan of Romero's dead trilogy.  Especially, Dawn of the Dead (which this movie goes behind the scenes to)...I couldn't WAIT to get my copy of this DVD into my collection, when I finally did I realized I wasted my money.  This is more of a documentary on Romero rather than the making of Dawn of the Dead.  Which is alright, but it wasn't done very well.  I learned only a few interesting facts about Romero and his directing style.  The behind the scenes of Dawn of the Dead was *moderately* interesting at best...I was very disapointed at this.  And then there was the new footage from 'Two Evil Eyes'.....ZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........I watched for-I swear-it must have been almost twenty minutes on how they filmed one special effects shot that really wasn't all that special!  AND, I didn't even listen to the commentary track which I usually love to do.  I just didn't feel like I needed to go to sleep again...
...Trust me, people.  Save your money if you are thinking of buying it.  IF you run into this movie at the video store and see it's for rent....well, then it might be worth the 3 bucks to watch it once.  If I had only rented this movie I *may* have hated it just a *little bit* less.  But because I spent much more money to buy this garbage, I'm Irate.  The only advantage to owning this movie is if you have insomnia and sleeping pills won't help you.",984787200,5,1378,4.464

7899141,4,6549303141,"I bought this back when it first came out because I like the documentary and it was  Synapse Films website exclusive. Now it's listed on here for $10 (or $15 if you count the shipping ) less, guess I should of waited. I kinda consider it to be a lie about it being one of their website exclusives.",1499904000,,297,4.120689655172414
7899142,2,6549303141,"SYNAPSE has reissued Document of the Dead on blu-ray & dvd as the Definitive 2 disc set
now there's 2 versions the original 66min version that was released back in the 80's in only 1:33:1 ratio
and the new 102min version in 1:78:1 ratio which is around 35min of extra scenes added by Director Roy Frumkes
the 102min version i believe is the much better version to watch cause of the extra scenes
from on set footage of Two evil eyes right thru to George's Diary of the dead
also has some scenes of George with this family at his House, also has interview with his Daughter
i was expecting both versions to be on 1 Blu-ray Disc actually with new HD transfers for both versions
the 102min being the main version to watch and the original 66min added as an Extra
but tragically synapse didn't bother doing that, probably to Lazy
all synapse did was give the original version a new HD transfer on the Blu-ray Disc
and the longer 102min cut is on the DVD, pretty stupid decisions
it would make more sense adding both versions on the 1 Blu-ray Disc giving them both new HD transfers
there's only 1 new extra a new commentary by Director Roy Frumkes only on the original 66min version
i give 2 stars based on how the 2 versions were added to Disc
but i also give 5 stars for the 102min version being the most superior cut so if you just want the more superior cut
then you can still buy it as single DVD version on amazon",1495843200,,1414,4.299625468164794

7899145,2,6549303141,"This is a George Romero ego-fest and not a documentary of zombie films. This ""movie"" consists of director cuts, interviews, and behind the scenes at a handful of Romereo's works including non-zombie films. It mentions a handful of movies that his work has spawned, but never mentions there were zombie movies and zombie fans before his classic film. Romero is another Hitchcock and every frame of his film is a masterpiece. Even his kid agrees. This film would normally be a special feature of another film.

And not to mention with this limited edition comes a DVD with more footage than the original , so this is a steal , recommended for anyone who's a George Romero fan . Enjoy",1384128000,,378,3.7375
7899147,2,6549303141,"Aside from some interesting footage from the original documentary, which has its flaws, there is no flow or structure to the additional footage.  Much of the behind the scenes footage is fanboy euphoria surrounding Frumkes and acquaintances.  It's neither entertaining nor informative, much of what you would like to know about 1978 - 2013 isn't even touched upon.  If hearing how excited people are to be in this documentary, or what images on a train remind Frumkes of Romero films, enjoy.",1368230400,,491,5.037037037037037

7899149,3,6549303141,"I Love romero so this is a must have doc which contains all 6 romero's zombie films FOR THE FIRST TIME in a dvd plus a look to more gems like ""two evil eyes""...but wait a second...DID I SAID 6 ZOMBIE FILMS ? Yes NOTLD, DAWN (for the most part) and then LAND, DIARY, they all have a huge share in this dvd but where the hell are DAY and SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD ?
 This dvd runs 102 minutes and here is what we got from those 2 films.

 DAY OF THE DEAD: Just a few pictures in the beginning of the dvd feature and somewhere in the middle we get a short interview from nasty captain rhodes who reveals also his LOVE AFFAIR with...""barbara""...from NOTLD...LOL...AND THAT'S IT.
 SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD: We get to see NOTHING AT ALL except few footage of the film which is shown only at the end of the feature and i mean THE VERY VERY END...LOL

 Overall this was a nice effort but it could have been longer and better. At least don't forget we get all 6 (almost) romero's zombie movies in one DOC for the first time and don't forget (like romero said in the beginning of the dvd feature), while u watch this feature...DON'T SPEAK A WORD, TURN OFF YOUR PHONES OR ELSE ROMERO WILL KILL YOU AND WORST U WILL BECOME ONE OF HIS MILLIONS UNDEAD................LOL",1354665600,2,1247,4.2405063291139244
