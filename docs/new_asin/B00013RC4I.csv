8006042,3,B00013RC4I,"I'm surprised that so many of the people that reviewed this movie took it so darn seriously. Come on guys, it's a B-Movie in the fashion of those old car chase films of the seventies. You know, like 'Eat my Dust' 'Race with the Devil' 'Macon County', cheesy but fun films like that. Hell, 'Smokey and the Bandit' even kept running through my head as I watched the film in awe. And Sally Field was just as annoying as the girl passanger in this one. At times it even felt like her character was supposed to be...(!)...a spoof of Sandra Bullock's character in 'Speed'. But then, there were times when I kept thinking about how much the actress reminded me of Ally Sheedy.

And Casper Van Dien was perfect in this film. He's one of the cutest B-Movie heros of this generation. (Well, hello there, Tarzan)
And, so what, his hair was orange!? It was a little odd, I agree, but after awhile, it just seemed to add to all the cartoon-style action.
And remember folks,that's the key word, cartoon! If you watch it with that in mind, it may work for you. I will admit,at times I did find myself becoming bored with the repeated scenes of car chases, however, my curiosity of how the movie would end, kept me firmly on board. And, as someone else pointed out in a past review, it IS a real bummer when the driver, or, drivers of the phantom truck are revealed. It does change the feel and tone of the movie dramatically. It almost takes away, immediately, the crazy cartoon feel of the film. I was hoping, which I knew it wasn't going to happen, that the driver would of been more grounded in a supernatural style subplot. Like the creepy cult horror movie from the 70's 'The Car'. Good stuff!

SPOILER ALERT....SPOILER ALERT.....
I kept thinking to myself while watching the film....'My God! This is sooo over the top and goofy that this picture could go anywhere it wanted too'  Wouldn't it have been wonderfully delirious if, instead of three jocks climbing out of the phantom truck halfway through the movie, but a ridiculous looking cyborg, instead...?!...that continues to chase our hunk and his girl through the woods? I know it sounds crazy, but it would of worked. Or, and I really like this one, at the end of the movie, after all the pursuing and car crashings, the mean jocks, along with our cute hero and heroine, climb out of their vehicles, which are smashed in a ravine, deep ditch,or something like that, gathers themselves together, wipes off their blood and begins to laugh hysterically while they 'high five' each other.
""That was the best one yet!"" one can cheer, while the girl quizzes the boys about the bullets in the gun. Which, as the jock assures her, were fake. And, just as they all decide to 'play the game again', they hear the sound of coming cop cars which sends them off running and laughing like little hoodlums. Yeah. I know it's farfetched and even a little demented (Cronenberg did something similiar like this at the end of 'Crash') it still probably would of worked, (given a few changes throughout the film) This could of been the ultimate twist and prank on the viewer. I even betcha the reviews would of been different. Better, maybe not. Or, maybe so...?

But nevertheless, the movie is fine the way it is. Empty, silly and fun. Just like those old drive-in films from yesterday, or better yet, the car chase scene in Tarantino's 'Death Proof'.  Kevin BriaN",1326672000,2,3391,4.589108910891089
8006043,5,B00013RC4I,Obviously this is not meant to be a serious action flick.  Casper Van Dien...are you kidding me?  This film is hilarious!  I mean come on...that scene when they jumped the hay trailer...I almost pissed my pants from laughing so hard!  This is a must buy!,1245283200,2,254,4.5777777777777775
8006044,3,B00013RC4I,"Yeah, I, too, found that this movie was rather disappointing overall... the automobile chase scenes were okay, but that is about all that the movie has going for it... I felt that the characters didn't act in a realistic or logical or rational way, and the ending was pretty unsatisfying, also... the story had so much potential, but it really wound up being kind of a ""lead balloon"", in my opinion.",1212969600,,399,4.633802816901408
8006045,3,B00013RC4I,"The only thing this movie has going for it is its frenetically charged car chases, which make up about 90% of the movie.  Some beautiful Canadian scenery is also a plus.  But the movie which starts out fairly interesting in a ""Duel"" kind of fashion falls apart once we find out who the driver of the mysterious truck is.  The script is so implausible it's hard not to laugh at some of the outrageous things the writers expect us to swallow.  And Danielle Brett as the heroine Sonia is one of the most obnoxious characters to come along in some time.  If I were Casper van Dien (why the orange hair?), I would have thrown her out of the car long before; she does little but criticize, whine, flirt, whine, scream, whine.  There's one scene where he asks her to get him some duct tape; too bad he didn't put it over her mouth!  Poor Catherine Oxenberg (Mrs. van Dien) has as twenty second appearance as a doomed forest ranger.  What could have been a pretty decent film gets its three stars from the energy of the car chases and the stunt drivers who accomplished them.",1129507200,5,1067,4.408163265306122
8006046,1,B00013RC4I,"i caught the last 30 minutes of this movie on cinemax last night and had to make sure the world knows to stay away from this movie... the acting and dialogue is the worst i ever seen in any movie, no lie... it was so bad, i couldn't turn the channel so i can sit there and laugh out loud at how horrible it was... i'm glad i'll never have to do that again",1097193600,2,355,3.810810810810811
8006047,1,B00013RC4I,"Oh my God! This is the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. I cannot describe how bad this is. The hammy, ridiculous over-acting, the chase scenes straight out of CHiPS, the whole thing is ridiculous.

I hope the people who made this movie (everyone involved, including the catering) never ever work again. Oh. My. God.",1092268800,2,329,4.576271186440678
8006048,1,B00013RC4I,This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. My nine year old daughter could have written better than Greg Mellott. I am amazed a studio paid him money for this. To make a long review short. I did not care for it.,1039996800,6,217,3.8444444444444446
