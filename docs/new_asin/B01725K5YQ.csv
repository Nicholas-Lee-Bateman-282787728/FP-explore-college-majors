8737932,5,B01725K5YQ,"This is a quirky film about a very different family - based on a novel by John Irving - it has a great cast - young Rob Lowe and Jodie Foster, Beau Bridges as the Dad and a great cast of other characters that make up a family you won't soon forget.",1473897600,,248,3.7884615384615383
8737933,3,B01725K5YQ,"I watched the trailer and having embarked on a quest to seek out on blu any 80s era flick I've never seen or previously heard of I found this intriguing because of the cast who went on to do much bigger and better things (Jodie Foster, Rob Lowe, Beau Bridges, etc). Eclectic cast of supporting players too like Wilford Brimley, Matthew Modine in a scummy dual role, Wallace Shawn of Princess Bride fame, Nastassja Kinski, young Seth Green) and I'm still not sure what to make of this film. Some terrible things happen to these characters that are really off-putting considering the kind of light-hearted fairy tale-esque tone. It's an oddity. If you aren't easily offended and can hang with a strange family going through a strange set of events this is worth a gander.",1473379200,,769,4.703703703703703

8737935,4,B01725K5YQ,"""The Hotel New Hampshire"" just has a big heart, and Tony Richardson at the helm, directing with care, and adrenaline, visual virtuoso, while making always lovely choices, Even though the script is widely uneven, the stellar cast ( think the best Hollywood could offer you in the early 1980's) from a quaint, but essential Rob Lowe, a stubborn and wild Jodie Foster, a gorgeous Nastassja Kinski who's sensitive and romantic as the object of everyone's desire,  a believable Matthew Modine playing greatly at least 4 different roles, the excellent Beau Bridges and Amanda Plummer, and all the fantastic others, make of this movie a truly enduring, bewildering, rather magnifecent movie. Perhaps a missed masterpiece! Still, a fantastic, sophisticated comedy that can be surreal, while still moving our hearts, and letting us see the mix of mystical and greedy colors composing a realistic, and surreal, grotesque society desperately seeking for the love, we humans should all be much more acquainted to! Great production design, set dressing, costumes, make up, and outstanding cinematography, cast and the unforgettable Tony Richardson,  make of this an instant cult movie, and one not to be missed.",1455494400,,1198,5.3
