6361292,5,B00JJJ3REO,"24 has always been a fast paced thriller, and while it may have faltered a bit towards the end of it's original run, it returns with a vengeance. 8 hours into this 12 episode season, the show has continued to build momentum, and has not stopped in this latest installment in the series. These past 8 hours have been full of action, suspense, intrigue, and wonderful performances from the whole cast.

So far I see this ranking among some of 24's best seasons, unless the final 4 episodes in this 24 hour day (there will be a 12 hour time jump at some point) take a steep drop in quality.

Here's hoping that doesn't come to pass. This review will be updated at some point after the end of the season.

EDIT: Now that the final episode of Live Another Day has aired, it's time to continue this review.

The last 4 episodes of Live Another Day continued to build upon what the first 8 hours had done. Character's motivations remained clear, the narrative was fast paced and tight, and most importantly everyone got a chance to shine in their own way. These last 4 hours contain one of 24's most surprising twists as well.

Once the ball got rolling at the start of the season, it never stopped, and only continued to build momentum, resulting in one of 24's best seasons. These last 4 hours were some of 24's best, and this season (12 episodes) is one of 24's best, right up there with Season 4 and Season 5.",1402963200,84,1406,4.392307692307693
6361293,5,B00JJJ3REO,LOVE 24 - I've watched the series since minute 1 - I own the series on DVD...  but I am holding out on this.  I want the series on Blue Ray! and I won't dish out the bucks for this season.  DAMMIT FOX!  just do it!,1402876800,8,214,3.5869565217391304

6361299,4,B00JJJ3REO,"If you've seen the previous seasons of the show '24' and enjoyed them then this is a great ""last"" season.  As a stand-alone season it is difficult to follow what is going on so previous season knowledge would help a lot.  Like the other seasons of '24' there is a lot of action and suspense and when you think that everything is wrapped up then something happens to extend it further.  It also leaves the possibility of future seasons with the characters but that probably won't happen.

The only con is that you would need to be familiar with the characters from previous seasons to understand the full impact of the characters as they appear in this season.  I guess a second con would be that there are less than 24 episodes but I will take what I can get.",1512691200,,759,4.392857142857143

Then I began watching the new series 24: Legacy which with Kiefer Sutherland as an Executive Producer, which led me to read the reviews for Live Another Day.  Once I started watching Live Another Day it was impossible to stop.  It is a wonderful thriller and was the impetus for returning to the  previous series that I had missed. I am back peddling now having begun Season 6 and  will continue through Live Another Day which I will gladly watch again.  BTW it is not necessary to watch all the previous seasons.

6361336,4,B00JJJ3REO,"Four years after being sent into exile, Jack Bauer surfaces in London after getting a tip that there will be a terrorist assassination attempt on US President Heller who is in the city negotiation a new treaty. Also in London is former CTU computer expert Chloe O'Brian now disgraced for her support of Bauer and working for an underground group specializing in leaking government secrets. With Chloe's help, Jack hopes to warn the president and find the terrorists before they can attack.

The first thing viewers of any of the 24 series needs to keep in mind is that there are no happy endings. The next thing is that there are a lot of guns being waved around, usually in inappropriate manner, and lots of blood. Once over those hurdles, the viewer can just sit back and enjoy the interplay of the characters and the unfolding of the plots.

While the earlier seasons of 24 covered the entire day's worth of hours in real time, this season only covers half of a day that way, with the final hours summarized in the final scenes. Because of this compression, the first parts of the original plot moves along at a rapid pace before settling down into the second half of the ""day"" and an offshoot plotline. But Jack, although showing his age, is still the baddest guy on the street, and Chloe still manages to interpret a hex dump with a glance, so hang onto your hats.

Placing this edition of 24 in London allows the viewer to enjoy several British character actors in supporting parts, but also opens the door to problems with having a US agency operating in another country as though it's no big deal. The British government would rightly have fits with a gaggle of CIA agents waving weapons and shouting ""we're federal agents"" at the bad guys as though they have any jurisdiction at all. But after all, this is 24 and has little relationship to the real world. Just sit back and enjoy the action.

Kiefer Sutherland may get top billing, but the real star of this show is William Devane as President Heller. He steals every scene he's in as the harried president hiding the first symptoms of early Alzheimers from his staff while trying to complete a treaty negotiation and managing to maintain his composure while the terrorist threats escalate. Toss in the conflicted emotions about Jack Bauer being involved again in his and his daughter's lives, and there are multiple layers of acting skills being called upon.

The extras on the DVDs includes deleted and extended scenes and two featurettes about the London production and the choice of storylines for the season. There are no commentary tracks for the episodes this time around.

Unfortunately for the viewer, Fox decided to place mandatory previews of other DVD sets that they publish on three of the four disks in this set. The previews cannot be exited, at best only sped up in order to get through the commercials faster before you are allowed to get to the Main Menu of the DVD and proceed to the episodes. If this is Fox's standard methodology going forward with their future DVDs, it will mean that I will be purchasing few, if any, additional Fox titles to add to my home collection. When I've paid for a DVD set, I don't expect to be forced into a detour of commercial messages and previews with no way out each time I wish to view a DVD. Bad choice, Fox.

Recommended for 24 fans and those who enjoy fast-paced, action packed adventure.",1480377600,2,3407,4.640132669983417

6361414,4,B00JJJ3REO,"+++Warning...This will contain some spoilerish material from prior seasons, but no major giveaways from this season.  If you have not watched the prior seasons (especially season 8) then proceed with caution.+++

This season of 24 picks up with Jack having been on the run for 4 years, the actual amount of time that 24 had been off the air after the events of the 8th season.  He is an outlaw of the US government, and wanted by the Russians.  Former defense secretary, and Jack's old boss, Heller (played by William Devane) is now President.  He is in London negotiating to allow US drones to operate from bases in the UK.  Jack resurfaces, setting himself to be caught by the CIA in London to prevent a terrorist plot he uncovered to take place while Heller is in London.

This season is in some ways a continuation of the original series and in some ways very much its own stand alone thing.  The only regular characters from the old series are Jack and Chole, who has now gone goth-emo and joined a Wikileaks like organization that divulges confidential US information.  Audrey also returns this season, and is married to the President's Chief of Staff, but of course things get complicated with Jack back in the picture.  Yvonne Strahovski, in her first post-Chuck role plays the new version of Jack Bauer.  She is a CIA agent on the outs in the London Station who first ends up hunting then helping Jack.  Benjamin Bratt plays the London Station chief who ends up playing a much larger role in the overall plot.

The first 2/3 of the season is stopping the terrorist plot that involves using US drones to launch attacks in retaliation for the drone strikes the US had been committing.  One that is tied up, the last handful of episodes involve the Russians and Chinese, and land US and China on the brink of war.  Surprisingly things were not wrapped up in a nice bow to tie all the story lines up,  Given that there was no guarantee that the show would ever continue in any form, or that a movie was ever going to materialize, they end on  a pretty big cliffhanger involving Jack.  We do know what happens to him, but it is not the typical happy ending given to a main character.  Given that Kiefer Sutherland has said he will not return for another season of the show (which Fox has now as of 2015 has decided to move forward with) the ending they gave his character was not all that great from a fan perspective.

For those who get the DVDs there are a few extras.  A few short behind the scenes features on rebooting the series, filming in London, running an environmentally conscious production and about 14 min of deleted scenes.  Okay for what is there, but nothing great.  Also note while Fox did initially release the show on blu ray in the US, once they made the decision to drastically cut back the blu ray and DVD availability of the shows this is much harder (and more expensive) to get on the US region encoded blu rays.  The DVDs are pretty inexpensive and are still available for now, and depending on how much you want to shell out for a new or used version of the blu ray you may have to decide if the DVD is acceptable or you just want to stream it.",1449878400,,3175,4.453287197231834

The twist at the end and the reveal of who was really behind everything was just as good as all other previous seasons, and I liked who the bad guy turned out to be and how everything got finished off.

Season 8 is even labeled as ""the final season"" of 24 but a few later and in 2014 a new, shorter, version of 24 was shown. 12 hours instead of 24 hours.
I bought this DVD set to complete our complete series of 24 DVD collection, and yes I have it in digital backup copy now too! If you watch them as we are, one season right after the other, I think you see how well the writers kept the stories going, and how hard that must have been to do!
I'm liking this season better watching it the second time, it was a good Jack Bauer story with all the twists and turns of the series plotlines. Terrorist and armed drones to start and then other stories get mixed in.
All I get from all the seasons is you do NOT want to work in any secret government program! At least 1 person, if not more, will invariably be on the bad guys payroll as a ""mole"" in the organization!
Oh yes. The title for the Amazon ad lists Dennis Haysbert still as a star in the show, nope. His character was killed off in season 5.  Would I like to see a ""new"" 24 series? Sure!",1435276800,,1077,3.986111111111111
6361478,5,B00JJJ3REO,"Some ideas are just too good to die.  Thats why, four years after 24 ticked out its final second, it came back.  No, we didn't get a full 24 hours (although a full day is still covered).  Instead, 24: Live Another Day consisted of 12 episodes.  This show still knows how to get your blood pumping.

Just like its been four years for us, its been four years for Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland).  During all that time, hes been in hiding, trying to avoid the Russians who are out to get revenge for his behavior in season 8.  However, he resurfaces in London, and his first act is to break Chloe OBrien (Mary Lynn Rajskub) out of CIA custody.  Chloe has become a wanted hacker, disillusioned with the government and fighting to reveal the secrets they are trying to hide.  Jack needs Chloes skills and her new friends in his effort to stop a terrorist plot.

Yes, even on the run, Jack has managed to get intel about Margot Al-Harzi (Michelle Fairley, a terrorist who is plotting to take over drones and kill President Heller (William Devane).  Heller is in London at the moment, to sign a drone treaty, along with his daughter Aubrey (Kim Raver), who Jack still loves, and Aubreys new husband Mark (Tate Donovan).

Of course, breaking Chloe out of the CIA doesnt go unnoticed (especially with Jacks lack of subtly).  Soon he has CIA location chief Steve Navarro (Benjamin Bratt) overseeing his capture with agent Kate Morgan (Yvonne Strahovski) hot on his trail.  Only Kate isn't so sure Jack is the man they should be hunting.  Can he gain any allies in his efforts to stop the terrorists?  What will happen before the last second ticks out?

The producers claimed that this season was going to be different because it was shorter.  Heck, they famously promised that the show was going to dump us in the middle of the action.  I will admit the premier episode was definitely more ramped up than some of the old premiers, but they still took the time to explain all the new relationships and the set up for the season.  There was just more action going on in the background.

I will give the producers this  I don't think there were any wasted sub-plots this season.  You know, the sub-plots we never cared about but were there to fill up time as characters moved from one spot to another.  While one or two sub-plots seemed unimportant, they eventually tied in better to the overall story than the sub-plots did in the full seasons.

However, there are clich&eacute;s on 24, and many of them were still evident.  If you watched this without knowing there had been four years in real time between season 8 and this run of episodes, you wouldnt know by any fresh plot twists.

But you know what?  That truly doesnt matter.  As the season progressed, I was on the edge of my seat multiple times with my heart racing and the blood pumping hoping Jack could manage to save the day yet again.  The show has always been a thrill ride, and this season is absolutely no exception.  And there were one or two twists I didn't see coming.

And the acting is still top notch.  Four of the actors from the show returned (although it has been a couple of seasons since wed seen now President Heller and Aubrey).  They slipped right back into their characters as if no time had passed.  The cast of new actors were absolutely wonderful as well.  I do have to give a special shout out to Yvonne.  I loved her on Chuck, and it was great to see here again here.

This season is available on either DVD or Blu-Ray.  Either way, you get all twelve episodes in wide screen and full surround.  Both sets include deleted and extended scenes as well as a featurette on shooting in London, one on how they used headlines to shape the season, and finally one on filming while staying green.  If you buy the Blu-Ray set, you also get an extension to the season.  With the price difference between the two sets not being that great, if you have a Blu-Ray player, thats definitely the set to go with.

There are rumors that the producers are open to doing another event series like 24: Live Another Day.  With how they left Jack, Id say they absolutely need to do that.  If it does happen, Ill be back on the 24 roller coaster for every second.",1434758400,7,4213,4.471128608923885

6361575,5,B00JJJ3REO,"You know, I had my doubts about this from the beginning, and I had a little trouble wrapping myself around Chloe's Goth look, but before long the old 24 magic was back! I got pulled into this series (on DVD-I couldn't stand to watch it on regular broadcast TV with all the commercials and then waiting for the following week to see what would happen) and once again, nobody does it better then Team Jack Bauer! If you're a fan, you're going to love this-Jack is anything but diplomatic, and I loved every second! As always there's plenty of twists and turns, and you'll be on the edge of your seat to see what happens next, and how it'll all play out.  It's great to see William Devane back, this time as the president of United States, and of course his daughter Audrey. If you're an avid fan of espionage shows, like me, you'll be delighted to see supporting cast members from the series CHUCK and MI-5, along with a lot of other cool characters-both good and bad. There's the potential at the end for Jack to return, and I sure hope that happens! How does this stack up against the other seasons of 24? Even though it's a 12 hour ""miniseries"", I'd rate it up there with the best of them! Hopefully you'll purchase this, and if you do, be prepared to lose some sleep because, like the best of 24, you can't watch just one!",1422144000,,1324,4.3603238866396765

It took about 6 months but it was heartstopping and exciting! Was glad when this abbreviated season came onto TV so ordered it as soon as I could to add to my collection. It's a little different than the other seasons but it was very exciting and love that it was ""in real time"" like the others. Jack's the man! Chloe is the woman! They are the new Dynamic Duo! Michelle Fairley is a great villain and many of the other players are great in their roles. Lots of surprises and ""oh my God"" moments! If you liked 24, get this!",1421712000,,654,4.15748031496063
6361580,5,B00JJJ3REO,"I enjoyed 24 from the first episode and watched devotedly to the very end.  Unfortunately after about season 4 or 5 things began to get stale and it seemed like the writers were running out of ideas.  Kiefer Sutherland was looking tired as well and when it ended it seemed like the right thing to do.  When it was announced that this 12 episode season was rebooting the franchise I was worried and frankly prepared for disappointment.  Well, good news folks- Jacks back and hes as ruthless and lethal as ever before.  This time around the action has moved to London where President Heller (William Devane taking a break from peddling gold on TV commercials) is trying to broker a deal with the Brits to allow the US to continue to fly drones from Diego Garcia BIOT.  Hes accompanied by his daughter Audrey, played by the mopey Kim Raver and her weasely husband whos the POTUS Chief of Staff as portrayed by Tate Donovan.  Jacks been on the run and living underground as a wanted man by his own country and the Russians since the regular series ended.  Suddenly he surfaces in London and a manhunt ensues thinking hes there to threaten the POTUS.  The CIA manages to capture Jack but its too easy, shortly hes springing ex-CTU techie Chloe (sporting a new Goth look and clown makeup) from the agencies clutches.  In the past few years shes done a turn in prison for helping Jack escape and now works for a Julian Assange-type and a group of anti-govt hacktavists.  He needs her to help in his thwarting a plot by the wife of a terrorist killed by a US drone strike bent on seeking revenge with a device capable of hijacking our drones and using them for nefarious purposes.  The action is almost non-stop and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Yvonne Strahovski joins the cast playing a more serious spy than she did in her Chuck days who at first is hunting Jack but later winds up helping him once its proven that his mission is with the good guys.  This 12 episode format should be called 12 and not 24 since they obviously cant fit all 24 hours in real-time into a 12 episode format so the last show crams a bunch of stuff in to make it fit.

6361612,4,B00JJJ3REO,"I'm normally not a fan of action and sci-fi. However, London is my favorite city and I heard so many great things about 24. With that in mind, I decided to check out this past season of 24. I have no regrets.

24 is an excellent show. It's fiction and some things require a suspension of disbelief (seriously, can all of those things really occur in a span of 12 or 24 hours, and can a guy in his late-70's really become president? John McCain lost partially because of his age). Those minor gripes shouldn't deter people from watching and enjoying the series.

I just started following 24 this season. There were some things that happened in the prior seasons that affected this season that I didn't quite understand. A FEW SPOILERS. Jack Bauer was a fugitive in London for the past 4 years. Apparently, he was wanted by the Russian government and the Russians wanted the US to turn him in. Meanwhile, the widow of a terrorist who was killed by a drone, Margot Al-Harazi, wanted revenge against President James Heller. She planned to use an override device to launch a series of drone attacks against London. That woman was nuts- when her son-in-law had reservations about going forward with the plan, she mutilated her own daughter's hands in front of him.

Meanwhile, Jack was being chased by the US government. However, he was trying to convince them that his intention was to save the President. With the help of Chloe O'Brian, he was able to do so. Heller and Margot eventually reached an agreement where Heller would head to Wembley soccer stadium in London and let Margot fire a missile from a drone in exchange for Margot destroying the rest of the drones in her possession. She kept her end of the bargain, but with the help of Jack, Heller tricked Margot- he never went to the stadium. Jack eventually found out where she was and defeated her.

There was a subplot about Agent Kate Morgan's late husband Adam Morgan who committed suicide in prison after he was sentenced to life for committing treason. The government believed he was selling secrets to the Chinese. However, he was set up by Navarro. After Al-Harazi's death, Chinese terrorist Cheng-Zhi planned to use the same override device to initiate a war between America and China. He used the override device to  control an American drone and attack the Chinese Navy. He was working with the same Russians who wanted to capture Jack (I didn't watch the prior seasons so I'm still a bit confused about that). Jack eventually defeated Cheng-Zhi. However, a major character met their demise. Also, Jack made a selfless sacrifice which all but guarantees another season of 24.",1420156800,2,2641,4.732608695652174

6361628,5,B00JJJ3REO,"24 was a great TV series and 24:Live Another Day lives up to the prior greatness of the series.  Rarely does a TV series continue to captivate its audience for extended periods of time.  However, 24 is the exception which continually draws us in and keeps us glued week after week.  I hope the producers of this series realize the uniqueness of this series and the vast audience that it appeals too.  It would be great to bring this series back to TV and maybe when it eventually has to end we find Jack honored by his government for going beyond the call of duty in order to safeguard us as a nation.",1419724800,2,601,4.292035398230088

But ""24: Live Another Day"" ruined it all for me.  The premise and acting were excellent, even bringing Audrey back and healed was very touching, and of course Jack & Chloe' were awesome.  But what absolutely killed it for me was the ending. After all the characters went through over the years to end it on such a sad note ruined it for me.

6361633,5,B00JJJ3REO,"24 Live Another Day is far exceeding previous series. Story develops with a breathtaking quickness. Succession of marvelous unexpected twists holds you in tense all along the scenes. Who is a real mastermind behind the every plot? What is his final purpose? You cant take your eyes off even a second from the screen. Location in London and the existence of British Prime Minister gives fresh flavor to this episode. Meeting again scene of Audrey and Bauer is heartbreaking. End scene hints possibility of the sequel. Russian speaks to Bauer, I would say you're going to enjoy MoscowBut youd know I was lying.

Chloe explains her feelings to Belcheck,  I owe Jack. I wouldnt be alive if it weren't for him. Belcheck says,  Then we have that in common. Episodes contain many talks about friend. Bauer replied to Belcheck he didn't have any friends, when Belcheck asked Bauer about Chloe being Jacks friend. Chloe talked to Bauer,  You were my friend, if you wanted my help, you shouldve just asked. On other time, Chloe pointed out she was the only friend he had left, whether he wanted to admit it or not. Bauer acknowledged,  You were right about being my best friend.

Bauer expostulates with Kate on revenge. He took as much revenge as any man could possibly. He thought it would ease the pain, but it didnt. Somewhere in our heart, we have to really accept that. And then we can begin to forgive ourselves. Bauer admonishes Chloe saying she cant bring back the one she lost. But she can honor their lives by helping others. Its the only way up forwardThe privilege cuts are worth viewing.",1419552000,,1591,4.705035971223022

6361642,5,B00JJJ3REO,"Just finished with 24 (Live Another Day).  Definitely better than much of Season 8, which felt been there-done that until Jack made it personal in the last few episodes.  This 12-hour edition is tight, full of twists and turns (none of which are completely unexpected, because 24 fans are always looking things like a second shooter), and is a welcome return to form.  My favorite moment, however, comes from William Devane as President James Heller.  I won't spoil it for you if you have not yet seen the series, but it involves his boarding Air Force One after the events of the story.  Heartbreaking, and very, very well-written.

The DVD presentation is just fine, sharp picture and sound, 1.85 formatted, with a few EPK features on disc four.

My only real quibble is with the subtitle of the series:  too generic, and it made me think of a couple of Pierce Brosnan James Bond epics---Die Another Day and Tomorrow Never Dies.  24: Season 9 would have been just fine.",1419033600,,971,4.6982248520710055

It's good to see again Jack Bauer and Chloe.
The show is pretty good but there was no amazing surprises we were accustomed to in (most) previous seasons.
There are good changes though, making this new season pretty different compared to the old 24.
Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a show to be seen! Enough tension to keep you awake, to have you watch the 12 episodes straight!

6361738,4,B00JJJ3REO,"I was pleasantly surprised by this ""event."" Even though it did not depart much at all from the original formula, it was better than the last few seasons of the show. That's just fine with me because I loved the show for the first five seasons. I think Live Another Day proves that you don't necessarily have to change in order to be good. For example, I never believed that ""Trek fatigue"" was to blame for the decline of pre-J.J. Abrams Star Trek. That excuse is a convenient cop out for people like Brannon Braga who I think are still stuck In the realm of 90s era sci-fi. As long as you're producing interesting, quality material, it will be appreciated. I think back fondly on the days when 24 was at its best and I would wait for the season DVD set to come out and would devote a weekend to watching the whole thing. I'd like to do that a few more times if they go back to the 24 episode format.

As a digression, let me say that when you think about it, 24 episodes was pretty generous to viewers for a while. I remember back when a television show woul produce over 30 episodes per season. Then it was cut down to about 27, then 24, and not, on network tv, the standard is usually 20 or 22, but only if they do well enough to get past an initial order of 13 episodes! Now on cable, a typical season of Walking Dead or Game of Thrones or something is 13 episodes, at the MOST. It could be as few as 10 or 12, or in the case of the first season of Da Vinci's Demons, 8 episodes! What in the world is going on?? And look at the prices for season sets; a 10 episode season of Game of Thrones costs more on DVD or Blu Ray than a 22 episode season of Person of Interest, another fantastic show. Somehow I feel like we're getting ripped off. And don't tell me that you'd have to sacrifice quality to make longer seasons. If you work hard, like most people in the world who, by the way, don't get to go to glitzy premiers and live in gated communities and usually only get a couple of weeks of vacation per year, and if you think creatively, then the material will still be good. And we schlubs who slave away at jobs no one will ever know about will be able to enjoy twice as much of the shows we like (and pay good money for) every year. Just sayin'. I'll be sorely disappointed if 24 settles into doing 12 episodes per season, since they've already proved they can make a quality season with 24 episodes.

Also, I think  the creative team though have though ahead better when they created the timeline of the show. If they want to re-start the show, chronologically, Jack Bauer will be a senior citizen soon. However, I don't have any problem with an aging Kiefer Sutherland continuing to play an action hero. Liam Neeson does it beautifully, and before we became so youth-obsessed there was a long tradition of older actors in action roles--Lee Marvin, John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Charleton Heston, Clint Eastwood...
Bottom line, this mini-series of 24 was exciting and energetic. If you were not a fan of the original series, then you probably won't like it, but if you haven't seen it and are skeptical about its quality since the last few seasons of the show were pretty weak, I would say go ahead and check this out. You'll probabky be entertained.",1413849600,,3255,4.315359477124183

6361751,4,B00JJJ3REO,"Woah, color me surprised! After a few years off, the most misogynistic TV show in history comes back with what I would call at least a partially new attitude. Thanks to Yvonne Strahovski (who was, unfortunately, a victim of the so-called 'Fappening' photo leak, egads), we finally have a femme to look up to in the male-centric world of ""fearsome"" Jack Bauer. I don't think Mr. Sutherland knew exactly what he signed up for in the earlier seasons, but I wonder if perhaps the stinging criticisms from neofemmes such as myself resulted in a small bit of soul-searching. If so, it shows. I don't want to spoil anything, but even though there are some nefarious femmes to balance things out (Margot, anyone?), the producers/writers of Live Another Day have finally made amends with the angrier sectors of public.

For too many years, 24's stock-in-trade was the systematic denigration of femmes (of all stripes, which I suppose deserves some measure of backwards credit if we're trying to be fair). Nina was one of the more notorious, but here we have a nouveau 24 in which Jack is not necessarily ""top dog,"" but merely an important component of team that acknowledges both the x and y chromosomes for a refreshing change.",1413676800,2,1219,4.832535885167464

6361762,5,B00JJJ3REO,"For those of you who are 24 fanatics like myself, when you heard that season nine was being discussed a couple years ago, your heart skipped a beat and your pulse began to race.  Then you heard the season was only going to be half as long, and your heart sank. You were downcast for the rest of the day.  But there was no doubt in your mind that it was going to be in your possession as soon as sales began on Amazon.com.

Well I am here to say that while I was still sadened, like some lovelorn puppy-dog, watching the episodes and knowing they would end all too soon,,I was never disappointed.  The cast, crew, and behind the scenes producers, directors, and writers never strayed from the taught story line and sharp characterizations that has typified the series since its inception.  In fact, I got the sense that they packed a little bit more into the 12 hours than they normally would have had the series been 24 hours instead.

Sadness at its brevity aside, you will love it.  Everyone is aging gracefully and with dignity.  William Devane as President Heller gives an especially polished performance, a pinnacle to his career.  The Bauer-O'Brian bond is challenged, bolstered, deepened.  Scenes of the gritty parts of London are a special treat.

You are left, of course, hoping for a season ten.  You are even willing to accept another truncated production of 12 hours instead of 24, provided they don't wait too long to produce it.  Please, please, please.",1412899200,,1467,4.6395348837209305

6361788,5,B00JJJ3REO,"Jack Bauer is back, the man for whom 1 week and 2 days lasted 9 years... or if we're going by series continuity, like two decades. Kiefer's looking a bit leathery and weird at times, but he's still convincing as the psychopathic little thug who decapitated a prisoner just to use his severed head as a gift for those hard-to-please right-wing Timothy McVeigh-types (Season 2 - A fruit basket might have done the trick, but he doesn't do anything half-way). This time out, Jack is still considered a terrorist by his own government following his 'Day 8' rampage. Despite Bauer's best efforts, the one Middle-Eastern leader who was willing to sign a peace agreement was killed. He discovered that the gangsters behind the assassination were acting on behalf of the Russian government. But when one of these assassins killed Renee Walker, a.k.a. the chick he'd been sleeping with for... 2 hours, well -- 'this time, it's personal' (thankfully, he didn't say that; one of Jack Bauer's most laudable attributes is his ability to commit murder without delivering the cheesy puns that cheapen a beautiful act of violence between consenting adults). So he went on a delightful murder spree, concluded with a tasteful disemboweling and a baker's dozen of dead Russian diplomats. It seemed fair enough, but bureaucrats and politicians frown on that sort of thing, particularly his attempt to butcher the Russian president.

Four years have passed (which should bring the series up to around 2025, but everyone's still using the same i-phones and androids, which is sad), and like every other decent, hard-working terrorist, Jack heads for England. As it turns out, Chloe's in England too, skipping the Tate Gallery for sodium pentothal and waterboarding in some MI6 spook-shop dungeon. The London CIA field office is just a couple floors above it, which is convenient -- Jack sets himself up for capture, feigning surprise and resisting arrest, before doing his thing and busting out his nerdy pal (looking scary in her Siouxsie and the Banshees eyeliner). As luck would have it, the US President is in London too, and is suffering from the rapid onset of Alzheimer's. That, combined with a typically unethical and politically compromised Chief-of-Staff (typical for 24, not reality) makes it a bad time to find a proverbial and worse than literal sword of Damocles hanging above his head.

The big threat this time around is an English matriarch who has converted to a brand of weaponized Islam and is carrying a metric ton of hatred on her small shoulders. After people she loved were killed in an American airstrike, she has become a volatile mix of strong, ruthless, business-woman and bugf***-crazy fundamentalist Mujahideen. Everything is expendable in her obsession with vengeance, even her own children. Now that American drones equipped with powerful, computer-guided missiles are patrolling the skies like angels of death with gleaming titanium wings, the 'bad guys' get their hands on the codes that allow them to over-ride and take control. In a plot twist very similar to the first episode of the British SF series 'Black Mirror', the US President is told by Queenie Al Qaeda (played by Michelle Fairley, best known as Lady Catelyn Stark from 'A Game of Thrones') that if he doesn't give himself up to them, hundreds and thousands will die (in 'Black Mirror', the British Prime Minister is told by terrorists that a beloved member of the royal family -- in this case a fictional princess in her early twenties -- will be murdered live on the internet, unless he has sex with a pig on national television; and it's not funny at all... well, maybe a little).

Soon enough, Jack is back in action as the President's man. As he goes on his crazy mad-dash criss-crossing of London, he is helped by Kate Morgan, a field agent from the CIA London office, and Chloe, who has suffered a horrible personal tragedy that has driven her to raccoon-like mascara. She is also part of a wiki-leaks type group who are implicated (at least) tangentially in the plot. By day 9, the 'shocks' are not so shocking: [SPOILERS] the likable but narrow-minded CIA station head is, of course, a traitor. Every season, it seems, the CTU and now the CIA hire yet another terrorist. They need to work on tightening up their vetting and screening process. The President is always compromised in some way... In season 1, it was then-Senator Palmer's scheming wife, this time it's Alzheimer's. Every season, the President is betrayed by one of their closest advisers, usually their Chief-of-staff. Every season, the terrorist plot comes to an apparent end after 12 hours, but is then discovered to be a plan B, or a red herring, or a distraction, or there was someone else behind the plot, someone powerful and connected and likely to get away with it. Every season...

Every season, Jack Bauer's bad day makes for 24 very entertaining episodes. This time there are 12; the final episode breaks free of 'real time', and spans the final 12 hour period. With every other series scaling back to 20, 16, and 13 episode seasons long ago, it's incredible they kept a show that was locked into a 24-episode structure going as long as they did... With Kiefer Sutherland's still bankable status, his paycheck alone would have been 8 figures per season. But people were clamoring for more 24, and the studio made it so.

Yes, the producers and writers are pretty much flying on auto-pilot, following a well-tested formula with very consistent results. Still, they manage to alter things just enough, so that even the 8th Hour Betrayal that's as reliable as an atomic clock triggers some lizard-brain response. 24 is a strange show, in that if you choose to pick at the loose narrative threads, it'll unravel immediately; but if you let the silliness go and just watch it with your Logic-o-stat dialed down to somewhere between a sweet-potato and Colin Farrell-levels, it's always entertaining (It's rare that a tactic like that works, so don't bother with the pharmaceutical lobotomy; if you were thinking it might make that Blu-ray collection of NCIS Season 3 you got for Christmas watchable, it won't. No amount of valium and vicodin can salvage that mess. I realize that drugs are usually the answer to all life's problems, but not this time).

6361805,5,B00JJJ3REO,"3 years after the event in New York, Jack Bauer has come out of hiding in London, when he learns of a plot to kill the United States President. Live Another Day appears to be a one shot deal, but as we've seen, the shows popularity means there is always a chance it will pop up again. While Fox has said nothing about the future of the show, Live Another Day did average over 10 million viewers an episode. As I do, I'm sure those fans are hoping that number leads to either the series coming back, a feature film, or simply more mini-series. It's hard to imagine 24 taking place in another country and in just 12 episodes, but it didn't matter one bit, because of Kiefer Sutherland. The often criticized actor has found the Midis touch when it comes to Jack Bauer. I mean seriously, have you ever heard of a show that can completely change cast and location every season and still manage to survive? The cast, the location, even the date doesn't matter, because it has been and always will be about Jack Bauer. In a strange twist, as kind of a thank you to the fans, many characters from previous seasons have returned for the mini-series, and it only made it that much more enjoyable. Live Another Day features the same Jack, who really hasn't lost a step. It also comes with everything you came to expect from 8 seasons of the hit show. Live Another Day may only have been half as long as the other seasons, but it rivals every single one of them. If you're a fan or even a casual viewer of the show, give yourself a treat and sit down for 12 new episodes of this timeless television classic!",1407628800,,1595,4.337792642140468

6361810,5,B00JJJ3REO,"I enjoyed the way they brought Jack back this season, I think it was the best way to bring him back since Season 5. The two hour premiere was awesome then the action kind of slows down and they get into storyline mode until episode 6 and that is the action starts to pick up again. Episode 8 is kind of a filler but does serve its purpose and Episodes 9-12 are straight up 24 action with Jack kicking butt and not worrying about taking names. I won't spoil anything for anybody but I do believe this is the best season they have had since Season 5 and is a strong candidate for top 3 of all the seasons. William Devane is excellent as president and the best since David Palmer in my opinion. If you are a 24 fan, you will not be disappointed. More than likely you will be left wanting more but as a fan of 24 at the end of each and every season I am always left wanting more.",1405814400,,875,4.0344827586206895

This season of 24 was a very good season but not the best, which is why it only gets 4 stars.  I'm not a fan of the 12 episode season, it's called ""24"" for a reason and removing 12 hours of isn't a good idea.

A lot of the characters are back but one distinctly missing is Carlos Bernard (Tony).  I know bringing him back would have taking some creativity in the writing but I do miss that character.  I'm not a fan of Chloe's new ""Goth"" look but she played her character great.  James Heller does an EXCELLENT job as President and I'm glad Audrey was brought back.

The story line was very well written and I can see why it's only 12 episodes but I'm just not a fan of a 12 episode season, it went by too fast.

Overall this season is a top 5 season, but it's not even close to the best season of them all.... Season 5.",1405382400,13,988,4.051546391752577

Yes it had allot of over-the-top moments but it was way better than most of the other stuff on TV. Then season 6 suddenly turned to crap, in season 7 they bowed to the critics and gave as a new pc 24 and brought Tony back only for the sake of appealing to fanboys, then season 8 Jack suddenly falls in love with Rene who gets killed by the Russians and suddenly Jack finally snaps and takes the same personal revenge route he critisized Tony for. Now in this shortened season 9 the writers have outdid themselves again with their stupidity...

1-Jack is unlikeable anymore, even Navarro and the terrorists are more likeable

2-Bringing Chloe back is so lame, just to appease the fanboys, her goth look is even dumber.

3-Margot and Cheng are the terrorists? What ever happened to the interesting terrorists like Marwan?

4-Heller and Audrey are so annoying, even wose than Chloe.

5-This is supposed to be an American show, why is it in London? Would they do a season of MI-5 (Spooks) in Texas?

6-Kate is just a carbon copy of Dana Walsh.

7-This Russian storyline is just like the Chinese storyline, let me guess if their is a season 10, god forbid, Wayne Palmer, miraculously relected to his second term, is going to make a deal to bring him back to the US and hand him over to a terrorist to stop an attack? And Jack miraculously escpaes and proves them all wrong again yawn.

8-The Russian guy's mustache is so ridiculous, how would that happen in real life?

9-24 should have been a movie series after season 5. Have the first movie Jack breaking out of the Chinese prison, the second movie Jack stopping Fayed with a more believable storyline, the third movie Jack doing anything but what happened in season 7, 8, or this one. Its so played out as a TV series. It should have gone out on top with the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Spooks.",1404518400,10,1936,4.461756373937677

6361829,4,B00JJJ3REO,"Preface: This review is writted with the finale episode left.

For the last four years, there has been an on-again/off-again discussion about making Fox's groundbreaking action thriller 24 into a feature film. That idea kept falling apart though, and it's no wonder. The whole conceit of 24 is that it's a thriller that plays out in real time, and for a two-hour feature film, that just doesn't work. However, fans of the show, like myself, held out hope that we would see the death-defying adventures of former Federal Agent Jack Bauer (played with gusto each of the show's previous eight seasons with gusto by Kiefer Sutherland) once again in some form. Well, we got at least half of our wish. Show creators Howard Gordon and Robert Cochran, as well as executive producers Manny Coto, David Fury and Sutherland himself have created 24: LIVE ANOTHER DAY, a 12-hour/12-episode mini series which brings Jack Bauer back for half of his usual day, but with more than likely, the same amount of mayhem, chaos, destruction and thrills.

While the show embraces the format, it doesn't do it immediately. For the first six minutes of the first episode, we find ourselves in London, where a CIA strike team has found a target of high value that they are looking to capture. This target is Jack Bauer. If you remember the events of the final full season of 24, Jack had been branded a traitor when he was looking to assassinate the Russian President (for reasons that are too numerous to list here), and had been helped to escape by his only living friend, the intrepid Chloe O'Brian (reprised here by the irrepressible Mary Lynn Rasjkub), and for the last four years, Jack has been on the run and under the radar. Once Bauer is captured, though, the show begins the real-time format. As per usual, Jack has his reasons for being in London on this particular day, and has his reasons for the CIA allowing his capture. The president of this season is James Heller (reprised by William Devane), the former secretary of defense and father to the one-time love of Jack's life Audrey Raines (reprised by Kim Raver), and the president, his chief of staff Mark Boudreau (Tate Donovan), who is now Audrey's husband, have come to London to make sure that the Prime Minister (Stephen Fry) and Parliament will allow the US to renew its lease on British soil for one of the bases of their drone program. However, President Heller is in danger, according to Jack. He has found out that Chloe is in CIA custody for being part of a Wikileaks-type of hacktivist group called Open Cell, and he's allowed his capture so that he may escape and free her as well so that he can enlist her help to find out what the threat is. Thrown into the mix as well is London CIA station chief Steve Navarro (Benjamin Bratt), Open Cell's figurehead Adrian Cross (Michael Wincott), as well as CIA agent Alex Morgan (Yvonne Strahovski), who is about to be transferred back to the States in disgrace, but she thinks much along the same lines as Bauer does. The threatening party consists of the family of Margot Al-Harazi (GAME OF THRONES' Michelle Fairley), who is hijacking US drones via the ultimate maguffin to attack London to retaliate for her fundamentalist husband's assassination by a Heller-ordered drone strike. Jack's past with Heller and Audrey also come into play as he seems to, once again, be the only person capable enough of stopping this destruction. So lives will be lost, sacrifices will be made, and lives will be shattered whether by the violence of the day, or the duplicity of certain characters that has remained a constant throughout 24's history. As the season comes to a close, though, a wonderful and shocking appearance by a very compelling past villain in the show's history returns to haunt Jack, Chloe and Audrey, and it makes the stakes even more personal and with even greater stakes.

Make no mistake; despite the fact that it's only 12 hours long, this is VERY much 24. Everything you love about the show is here, but also everything you don't love about the show is here as well. The action beats are great, the tension is palpable, and the performances are, by and large, very good. However, the show does get extremely bogged down in its various subplots: Morgan's ex-husband's sale of secrets to China right under her nose, Heller's secret health condition, Mark's back-channel dealings with the Russians who want Bauer's head, Chloe's recent tragedy, Margot's dealings with her daughter Simone (Emily Berrington), and that the reason for Heller's visit is to RENEW A LEASE, which apparently is so important, it will be the most important part of his presidency. Really? They couldn't have thought of anything more... I don't know... seemingly important? The show's political overtones are present as well, and couldn't be more current in regards to our country's current drone policy. The show, however, is smart enough to neither approve nor condemn, but allow the viewer to be the judge.

From a writing standpoint, the show has never been particularly strong in dialogue, with the exceptions of Jack and Chloe usually having the only really good lines, and that's not really different here. The characters are mostly, again also par for the course, pretty one-dimensional, until something actually happens. The actors do their best with them, such as Fairley's work with the one-note Margot, Fry as the stuffed-shirt PM, and Wincott with the initially bland Cross. The weakest link (once again) is Raver as Audrey, who has always been the least interesting or compelling of Jack's love interests. If this were a full season, they might have more time to dedicate to showing how the trauma that Jack is at least partially responsible for (back from season six, easily the show's weakest) might be brought to bear in her character, but she seems to exist either as a bland plot device or as a potential prize for Jack to win back at the expense of Mark, who is the man who had to help Audrey pick of the pieces of her life that Jack shattered. The show's brightest new star is definitely Strahovski, who is another strong female companion to Jack, smart and determined and ready to bring as much badassery as her male counterparts, much as Renee Walker was in the final season, but has a strong enough definition of character to stand out on her own. But again, it's Sutherland and Rajskub who walk away with the best moments and the best work.

24: LIVE ANOTHER DAY is certainly a worthy addition to the 24 franchise, because it brought everything back for presumably one last go, and while it might not reach the heights or some of the other seasons, it's enough to keep you in suspense and keep you guessing where it will go and how it will end.",1403827200,51,6747,4.768177929854577
