8510664,5,B0075WMDTC,"Just what I needed. As the video title states, this video contains 10 min stretch breaks. Unlike those on some other videos, they really are 10 minutes (not 5 min warmup plus 10 min workout plus 5 min cool down, and not 10 minutes plus introductory babbling) so they are easier to fit into every morning. It helps me safely loosen and awaken joints and muscles for the day. Being able to run the workouts either in ""with instruction"" format or ""without instruction"" format is awesome. It is the ""without instruction"" version of the workout that takes 10 minutes. You'll need longer to watch the version with instruction but you'll only need to watch that once or perhaps as a refresher. The music is perfect - both the timing and the volume. The talking during the ""without instruction"" version is just enough to remind you at key points to breathe or go bigger or relax or whatever is needed at the time. No cardio but that wasn't what I was looking for. I haven't done all the workout sequences yet but based upon the standing sequence I can tell you that 1) it is something I'll actually do - since I have actually been doing it, 2) I feel better for having done it, and 3) in addition to being good for my joints and muscles it is also mentally calming, centering, and awakening at the same time. The other day, I even did some of the moves during a work break and found that to be a helpful mental and physical reset. This video is definitely not just for dancers or those that are in great shape - although I would imagine they too could benefit from it.",1506038400,5,1560,4.401384083044983
8510665,5,B0075WMDTC,"I did this DVD last night and it was a real treat after a long day at work.  It gave me an opportunity to stretch, relax and become mindful of any aches and stiffness.  I like how it took its time to breathe through each exercise and allows the viewer to move within their own range of motion. I especially loved the seated series because I really felt the rotation of the spine plus I can do these at my desk in the office when no one is watching.",1474502400,4,448,4.022471910112359
8510666,5,B0075WMDTC,"I'm an adult who has returned to taking ballet classes after taking 7 years of lessons as a teenager. Finis Jhung has taught me so much about ballet basics, proper stretching technique, and how to move my body to ensure proper placement and execution. There are several things that set his instructional DVDs apart from others. First of all, Finis carefully explains steps and how they should be executed. He provides clear directions and guidance so that you are well prepared to execute a step or a stretch correctly. This is a great video for people who need to take a stretch break. I will use this DVD whenever I've had a long day at work or have sat for long periods of time. I will also use this DVD after a ballet class so that I can properly stretch my body. I'm thrilled with my purchase and will definitely buy DVDS from Finis again. I add to my Finis Jhung DVD collection whenever possible.",1456358400,,902,4.472727272727273
8510667,3,B0075WMDTC,This dvd is good if you are not very flexible. I found it too basic for me. One move is like doing a hula dance in slow motion. Like I said good for someone who is not very flexible. Finis Jhung shows his care and passion but I thought the dvd was far too overpriced for what you get.,1443657600,,284,3.830508474576271
8510668,5,B0075WMDTC,"All Finnis Jhung's videos are great and fery functional in all the excercises they are relaxing and have a practical purpose in every movement. This tape is a warmup,and excercise stretches all in one and the movements are slower ,thereby gives  the body full benefits of flexebility andpromotes circulation----this is very  good for older people I'm 82 and this is just great for me",1405814400,3,383,4.96875
8510669,5,B0075WMDTC,"Anyone studying ballet or using it to get in shape should own Finis Jhung videos. They are, bar none, the finest instructional videos on ballet I have ever found. I marvel at this man's knowledge and gift of teaching every time I do one of his classes.

Learn the right techniques through clear simple instruction that will make all the difference in your dancing.

Not just limited to young students, these are also great for anyone older who would like to reacquaint themselves after classes in their youth, or who have always had a yen to try ballet. Also, anyone doing other workout programs such as weights or Pilates will especially benefit from these stretching classes.

I use the Ten Minute Stretch along with kettlebell and Pilates workouts to keep muscles long and lean and prevent injury.  I also have his Meditative Stretching and recommend it highly.",1379116800,3,864,4.857142857142857
8510670,5,B0075WMDTC,"This DVD truly belongs in every home.  I own other stretch DVDs but this is my ""desert island"" DVD that I take with me when I travel and that I turn to for unfailing relief of physical aches and pains and mental stress.  Finis Jhung is acknowledged as an unsurpassed ballet expert, teacher, and coach, and one of the many wonderful things about this program is that he, who works with some of the finest dancers of our times, shows such understanding of the challenges faced by those of us who are less physically gifted.  This program is very gentle and entirely safe yet it provides a superb, thorough stretch regimen for the entire body.  I have done it on my own and also along with my mother (in her eighties) and due to Mr. Jhung's careful, patient, detailed instruction, both of us were able to ""customize"" the stretches to the level appropriate for our abilities.  The exquisite demonstration by Melissa Elstein provides beautiful inspiration as well as an example of flawless form for those who are following, and the lovely, sensitively nuanced music adds both to the aesthetic experience *and* gently guides one into following the right rhythm and pace.
I should add that although I obviously write from the perspective of someone who is *not* an accomplished dancer/athlete, this DVD would be just as valuable for people at the peak of physical ability as it is for the rest of us.  Indeed, people who regularly push themselves in vigorous activity/performance might have special need of this DVD's soothing, meditative aspects.  Whether one's daily life involves demanding physical exertion or ""stiffening"" sedentary desk work, this stretch program provides an immersion in beauty, grace, and flowing, harmonious movement that is comforting and cheering as well as physically beneficial.  Absolutely brilliant and irreplaceable!",1341360000,7,1841,5.072847682119205
