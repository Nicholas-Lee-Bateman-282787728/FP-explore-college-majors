8326122,5,B0015YQNTM,"This is an outstanding documentary!  From the very beginning to the end it is filled with powerful information about the life and work of a great humanitarian, Ida B. Wells, who bravely fought against the lynchings of innocent Black people following the civil war in 1865. It tells real American history not taught in schools about how Blacks made rapid gains during the period known as reconstruction in business, politics and education, only to have white racist hate mobs form to destroy their businesses and murder innocent Black men, women and children.  I recommend this program very highly!",1404604800,,597,5.081632653061225
8326123,1,B0015YQNTM,"I was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman, but I was very unhappy with the product.  Dull.  Two other items included on the video, but the part about Wells consisted of a person reading from a book.  Get the book biography instead of this product--a waste of money.",1294012800,,281,4.365384615384615
