5773468,5,B00D44IQ6Y,Absolutely LOVE the AKB0048 series!!!! I was so happy to find this series at a good price and was sent in excellent condition!!,1393804800,,127,4.565217391304348
5773469,5,B00D44IQ6Y,"AKB0048 has most likely just become my #1 favorite anime, but since this review isn't about the anime itself, I'll move on to the actual product itself.

The shipping was really great. At the time of purchase, it was available for Prime 2-day delivery.

The blu-ray itself was pleasantly exceptional. I originally marathoned this anime via online streaming, but the blu-ray felt like an entirely new experience. Not only was the image generally sharper overall, but a lot of the art assets were refined and cleaned up as well. There are also certain scenes that I don't recall seeing via streaming most likely due to being cut from the initial release.

As far as performance goes, I have not had a single problem with it so far. Watched through the entire thing in both English and Japanese with absolutely no errors or difficulties whatsoever. I've purchased DVDs from other websites and often had numerous playback issues (scenes skipping around, disc read errors, etc), but this blu-ray played for me perfectly fine and I have had no issues thus far.

So who would I recommend this product to? Certainly not everyone. If, for example, you do not enjoy whole-girl series (series whose cast mainly consists mostly or entirely of females), then you may not want to pick up this title. My best advice is to check out a few episodes online and if you like what you see, then definitely give this a purchase as it also helps out the makers/developers of the series.",1392595200,,1463,4.770750988142293
5773470,5,B00D44IQ6Y,"Full Disclosure: I prefer anime with space ships, giant robots and lots of space battles.

To my surprise, there were robots and spaceships (if only as an aside to the main story).  But the girls steal the show and your heart as you are pulled into the world of the multi-generation singing group AKB0048.

The music is very well done too.",1392422400,,339,4.524590163934426
5773471,5,B00D44IQ6Y,"Its a great anime, with full of laughs and nice blend of animation with cgi effects. I would recommend this for everone to watch.",1392422400,,129,4.416666666666667
5773472,5,B00D44IQ6Y,AKB48 has been my favorite idol group and I have all their songs from when they started. When their anime AKB0048 came out I just had to have it and I just love it I highly recommend it any people will love this anime.,1388448000,,218,3.977272727272727
5773473,5,B00D44IQ6Y,"A must buy anime, I definitively liked this series, since it was premier a year ago, I have to say thank you to the people of Sentai Filmworks for releasing this anime and bringing us just the best to all of us",1384214400,3,210,4.023809523809524

8589369,4,B00D44IQ6Y,"The series itself gets 5 stars. I looove akb0048 and have watched it several times. I even like the english dub, i think the voices are very good.

My problem is a) the video quality, which doesnt seem to be fully hd at times. And b) they did not provide subtitles for the songs. The songs lyrics are meaningful to the story and they really NEED translation in my opinion. Perhaps it was a copyright issue, but its a shame.",1488672000,,423,4.2875
8589370,5,B00D44IQ6Y,Thank you!,1485216000,,10,4.5

8589373,5,B00D44IQ6Y,<3 it. Its a very cute story and the song choices of AKB48 are awesome.,1423008000,,71,3.8
8589374,3,B00D44IQ6Y,"I absolutely love this series and season 2, however, my only problem is the lack of subtitles in the songs which if you didn't know is a major part of this series. So, you get to play guess what they are saying for an entire episode sometimes. Thank goodness for Crunchyroll. They subtitled the songs and spoiled me. I just don't understand how a musical type of anime does not get the music subtitled, pretty ridiculous. So, I am taking 2 stars off for that disappointment. The overall series gets 5 stars - 2 stars from the people who produced this Blu-ray for a overall combined total of 3 stars.",1417910400,4,599,4.454545454545454
8589375,4,B00D44IQ6Y,All the girls have such interesting personalities that you can't help but love them! The action is just enough to make it different from other series and allows the girls to shine in their own way. I enjoyed the story line with all of it surprises. You should defiantly look into these idols.,1409011200,,292,4.528301886792453
