5100131,5,B007NPXP5C,"I've been a Naruto fan for a long time, its something that will never get old. I love Naruto!! One of the best anime's ever!",1350950400,2,124,4.0
5100132,5,B007NPXP5C,"This was a great set of DVD's with some epic battles and a lot of the characters that I like best! One of these battles is between Jaraiya and the Pains...it is great animation and full of powerful jutsu and fighting...plus emotions, if you love Jaraiya. Another epic battle is between Itachi and Sasuke which has been built up since the first few episodes of Naruto. It is great...but I am not a Sasuke fan...so it was not my favorite part of the disc set. I love that team 8 and 7 are involved in these episodes chasing Itachi. The characters on these teams are the coolest!! They end up fighting Tobi and we get to see them all in some action. Hinata, as usual, is concerned about Naruto. Hinata ends up getting rudely scolded by Sakura for looking up in concern when Naruto is smashed by Tobi. Team 8 is involved not only in tracking Itachi...but some of the attacks.

Buy this set from Amazon....it is a must for Naruto fans!!",1349308800,,931,4.412790697674419
5100133,5,B007NPXP5C,"If you say Naruto is not the best anime ever then tell me what is and I will gladly educate you explaining why your wrong. But the Jiraiya and Sasuke fight are definitely some of the best fights in the show. But this show is definitely the greatest not jus because of the fights, but because of the story I also like One Piece, Fullmetal and etc But Overall this show so far is the greatest anime ever. I cant wait for it to end because then it will be easier to purchase them all.",1347408000,7,481,4.073684210526316
5100134,5,B007NPXP5C,"Box Set 11 continues the arc I have personally dubbed Sasuke: Shippuden. Although Naruto only makes a few appearances, this set grants some of the most memorable highlights of the series: stunning battle sequences, story maturation and the beginning of a revelation that will steer first-time viewers right back to the beginning. Jiraiya's final moment of glory has come, as well as the pinnacle in Sasuke's development that fans waited over 200 episodes of cannon material to witness. A prophesy is relayed, a brother discovers the obsession of revenge, and a death occurs that will, in the near future, shake Naruto's entire world.

I dislike purchasing Naruto sets containing filler, but like Box Set 10, you don't have to worry about that with this one. The few added scenes are fleeting and forgivable. The only real complaint I have is the fact that the set concludes so abruptly, just before one of the major plot twists in the episode titled ""Truth"".",1345852800,3,958,4.950310559006211
5100135,5,B007NPXP5C,"This disc set by far has been the best I've seen of Naruto Shippuden: Uncut.  There's a lot of action, and double twists you never expected with Itashi.  Even though there is a great loss of an important character, where the battle was lost too easily in my eyes, Disc set 11 covers the most action!",1344816000,,299,4.321428571428571
5100136,5,B007NPXP5C,"This Wonderful DVD Set contains 3 discs. Disc One contains the 2 Part special Tales of a Gutsy Ninja -Jiraiya Ninja Scrolls and the beginning of an amazing  battle between Jiraiya and a very formidable opponent from Jiraya's past. Disc Two continues and ends the fight with Jiraiya and starts a very long awaited, epic battle. Disc Three has the end to this fight and we learn some important things about the past and reveal Tobi's identity. the Dub is wonderful and done very well. I've yet to watch Japanese with English Subtitles though. Special Features are English Dub Omake and some other offerings from Viz Media. I reccomend it for 12+ for Mild Blood, Extreme Violence, and Profanity. Overall 10 out of 10 I look forward to the next set.",1343260800,8,745,4.687022900763359
5100137,5,B007NPXP5C,the box set was good except for the price!!! i wud wait till the season is over so that they will lower the price and put 25-26 episodes per set but i dnt think i can wait!!!! i hate watching it on japanese language were u read the subtitles it gets rlly annoying.. im a big naruto fan!!! i just hope they shud lower the price per box set,1342656000,,338,3.9130434782608696
5100138,5,B007NPXP5C,"First a warning to fans of naruto shippuden: Stay away from any discusions or reviews concerning Naruto shippuden from episodes 127 onwards. There are always people out there who want to ruin the customers satisfaction by spoiling important scenes or events. If you`re curious about the product you can safely read my reviews without important moments being ruined. Now for the review.

The previous boxset ended with an epic akatsuki fight and the revelation of a major character, who plays a huge role later in the series. It was a great boxset and the addition of kakashi chronicles made it unforgetable. If you enjoyed Kakashis past then get ready for Jirayas story. Jiraya is one of my personal favorites in Naruto, and the chance to see his past was more than welcome. Jiraya`s days under the 3rd hokage are shown, including a cocky and cheerful jiraya trying to pass the bell test. Viewers of the original series will notice just how similar Naruto and Jiraya are. Jiraya`s childhood is only chronicled over 2 episodes here, but his backstory is far from finished; We follow jiraya on his quest to write a book and see his relationship with the 4th hokage. But most crucialy we see his encounter with a group of war orphans...

As great as Jirayas past is it pales in comparison to the main event and that is without a doubt, Sasuke vs Itachi. The moment has finally come for Sasuke to exact vengance on Itachi for the massacre of his clan. Masashi Kishimoto doesnt disappoint here - The fight is intense, with a shocking revalation. The fight will have you guessing as to the winner right until the shocking finale.

A special mention to the soundtrack, which has only gotten stronger since the show started.  The opening theme, Sign, sung by Flow is fantastically epic. When those credits start(which are brilliantly animated) you just know it's gonna be amazing. Particular highlights during these episodes are Pains theme and utsusemi.

This isn't the only epic fight on display in this set as we finally see jiraya go toe to toe with the akatski leader Pain. Naruto shippuden just gets better and better from here on, and this boxset is superb. You must get this!",1341187200,25,2175,4.773936170212766
5100139,5,B007NPXP5C,"Jiyara's past is pretty interesting. But to me, the showdown between Saske and Itachi, and all that goes along with it, is outstanding!  This is the culmination of the Saske/Itachi storyline thats been building since the start of the show Naruto.  And in my opinion, it's mind blowing.  I would have never expected twists like this!  You will not want to miss this set!",1338422400,11,369,4.71875
5100140,4,B007NPXP5C,"This set covers mainly the battle between Jiraiya vs pain, and Itachi vs sasuke. I don't like to buy viz media dvd's because they are over priced for so few episodes. I only decided to purchased this and the previous set because these episodes are my favorite of the series. I know that this hurts but, If you people are expecting viz to bring the price down or release more episodes per dvd then you would most likely wait until the series end before they rerelease this.",1334102400,15,472,4.436781609195402

5100167,5,B007NPXP5C,"Great story. I love when anime progress stories like this. The original naruto series was well written. Each character was interesting. Alot of touching moments. Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

To have both epic encounters in one box set is greatly pleasing. The Sasuke vs. Itachi battle is especially wild, with various jutsu of monstrous proportions - when Orochimaru comes up from the depths, only to be sealed away for good this time, I was like ""What, this is wild - the multiple headed giant white snakes of Orochimaru vs. Itachi's Susanoo - Is this a Godzilla film I'm watching?""
