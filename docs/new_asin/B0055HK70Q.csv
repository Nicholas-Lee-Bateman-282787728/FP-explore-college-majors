4578404,4,B0055HK70Q,"I enjoyed this a bit better than the book. The high ""oh, come-on"" factor and sense of jumping-through-hoops to make a mystery when the procedural more than carried the plot translated for the movie better than the book.",1416873600,,219,4.7894736842105265
4578405,5,B0055HK70Q,"Marvellous movie with excitement all the way from beginning to end, as the story unfolds a greedy killer just wants $20 million after killing seven innocent people at the station. His demands are simple give me the money or more people are going to die, now these words I have heard before and some how the bad guy doesn't win only the good guys. Sound easy enough as it goes but there is a little problem with that, and that is who he is going to be dealing with. Wonderful and very cleverly done that you won't be disappointed as the suspense is killing and a very different thriller so get ready for a ride of your life with this one. Fantastic acting with a fabulous storyline that you can't go wrong with. I rated this an A grade plus for the terrific ideas and full on entertainment that will have you glued to the chair, so what are you waiting for, go on get moving pick up the movie, crab the popcorn so you can settle in for the night in with feet up relaxing, well trying too anyway. Enjoy!",1409788800,,1001,4.2460732984293195
4578406,5,B0055HK70Q,"I first saw this movie on Lifetime a few years ago and couldn't find it any place then it popped up on Amazon. I bought it for a great price and have watched it several times since then. I enjoyed the movie very much though it has some creepy scenes in it, not for children. Though children are in it. Good movie and the acting was fine.",1396915200,,337,4.044776119402985
4578407,3,B0055HK70Q,"It was pretty good. Didn't have the flash of a big production but got the job done. The only part that wasn't feasible was the lack of closed circuit TV cameras in the venues where the shooting occurred.

Witnesses are extremely unreliable, cameras are reliable. Any cop will tell you that 50 people will give you 50 different stories.",1393200000,,335,4.677966101694915
4578408,5,B0055HK70Q,I saw this movie on lifetime and was able to finish looking at it. I had to order it and I'm so glad that I did.,1362268800,,112,3.3461538461538463
4578409,3,B0055HK70Q,"This is a rather bland drama that was obviously born as a made-for-TV Canadian movie. It was transferred from TV without editing. Even the fades that would have surrounded commercial breaks have been left in. Since it was designed to be aired to general audiences, it has a certain unrealistic Cleaver Family patness.

However, there are certain points about the movie that make it worth watching. For one thing, we get to see a documents examiner at work. That branch of forensics usually doesn't figure in our TV CSI shows, which generally feature only the more sensational aspects of criminal investigations.

""The Devil's Teardrop"" has a good, resonant title - and an interesting ending. So I didn't mind too much that what came in the middle of this sandwich had a bit of the flatness of processed cheese.",1322611200,3,810,4.86231884057971
4578410,1,B0055HK70Q,"Rented this one and the movie ""Setup"" from Redbox and both earn less than one star Kiosk rating for mostly the same reasons. Wooden stereotypic acting, implausible plot and inane script that only someone who has done nothing in life but write scripts could come up with. Had that made for TV quality. Checking on IMDb confirms that the lead actors' experience is almost totally TV series, TV mini-series and TV movies.

It's one of those movies where you can almost see the film crew surrounding each actor as they recite some short piece of monologue before cutting to the next bit of monologue.",1316563200,,596,4.730769230769231
4578411,3,B0055HK70Q,"I remember seeing this on Lifetime maybe a year ago. Thought it'd be interesting on a network that is mostly for women. I thought it was enjoyable to watch, but hardly groundbreaking. Unfortunately I was able to predict almost everything within a half-hour. Still it was a nice television film that surprisingly got transferred to dvd. Personally I wouldn't buy it, even if the always entertaining, and quite hot, Natasha Hendridge is in it. Well worth a rental though IMO if you can't find it getting repeated on cable tv.",1315699200,,523,4.822222222222222
4578412,3,B0055HK70Q,"The movie opens with a killer (John MacDonald) shooting people in broad daylight at 12:00 in Union Station, Washington DC. We get to see the killer's face. In spite of this, there is no good description of the killer who looks like Dolph Lundgren and apparently there are no cameras in use there either. The authorities get a note and phone call from a Russian accented man, whose grammar is incorrect. The note asks for a ransom, or else the killer, known as ""The Digger"" will continue to kill. The killer drops black shell casings as his calling card.

Easy enough. You plant the money with a tracking device, then nab the guy...unless the guy dies crossing the street in a hit and run and there is no one to pay the ransom to. Natasha Henstridge plays Margaret Lukas, the FBI person in charge of quickly locating the killer before he kills again.

The movie runs with a brief subplot with Tom Everett Scott as Parker Kincaid. He is the best manuscript expert who left the FBI over an incident which still gives his son Robby (Jake Goodman) nightmares. His daughter Shannon (Rachel Marcus) seems well adjusted. His drunken ex-wife (Joanna Jang) is now sober and plans on getting married. She is serving papers so she can have custody of her children who she has been trying to buy with gifts. Olivia Jones plays Parker's attorney.

Of course the two plots run together as Parker consents to help. He tells us things about the man who wrote it and possible future targets. Natasha Henstridge appears to have some past emotional issues in case this crime story didn't have enough drama.

The movie is made for TV with its timely commercial fade outs, complete with a few notes of dramatic music. It has 3 Canadian award nominations.

The title, ""Devil's Teardrop"" comes from the handwriting analysis, the way the ""i"" was dotted. The movie was more mediocre crime drama than ""chilling suspense"" with more drama than action. The acting was a bit bland. I thought Rachel Marcus was good as a child actor while Joanna Jung was almost comically bad. There really wasn't any great dialouge.

Note: The FBI has a machine that can read indentations on a piece of paper (ESDA). It is so sensitive it can read up to the previous 5 pages of indentations. It is nothing like what the movie shows us.",1315094400,2,2287,4.6345679012345675
4578413,4,B0055HK70Q,"""He will kill again at 12 each day for the next 2 days. I am wanting 20 million in cash.""  When a man known only as ""The Digger"" opens fire in a train station many are left dead.  The only clue the FBI has is a hand written letter with demands on it.  Agent Margurete (Henstridge) needs help analyzing it and the best is retired specialist Kincaid (Scott).  I was a little weary of this at the outset.  The actors I like, but it is a ""Lifetime"" movie, and that kinda scared me.  After about 10 min I was hooked and was really shocked at how good this movie was.  Good acting and good story telling made this one tense all the way through.  Not only is it one of the best ""Lifetime"" movies I have seen, it's also one of the better movies coming out this week.  Without trying to give anything away, this is also the first ""Lifetime"" movie I have seen where the man is portrayed as a good guy.  Way to go.  The only complaint I had is the ending, but being the type of movie this is it is to be expected.  Just a little too anti-climatic for my liking.  Other then that I really enjoyed this.  Overall, very entertaing and tense, a very good choice. I give it a B+.

Would I watch it again? - I might, to catch clues I may have missed.

8458377,3,B0055HK70Q,"This is a pretty formulaic made originally for TV movie, where you've got stuff like a bomb with a digital countdown clock face, main character cops storming a building they think the bad guy is in, yet this is set in Washington DC, surely there is a S.W.A.T. team in DC that would do this?  Not to mention there don't seem to be any cops in Union station, granted I went there in the late 90's, but there were plenty of cops when I was there.  I don't remember but am pretty sure there would be lots of security cameras too.  But anyway, we've got a guy who has sent a note that he'll kill three times at 12:00 if he doesn't get $20 million dollars.  Because time is a ticking, and the mastermind is apparently dead, the FBI need the note analysed for clues to know where the hired assassin will turn up next.  So they try and recruit a stay at home dad (Tom Everett Scott, Z Nation, AN American Werewolf in Paris) who used to be the best at this type of thing, but has quit this line of work after a bad guy didn't like him, turned up to kill him and scared his son who hasn't recovered yet.  The dad refuses to get involved due to his ex wife (Rena Sofer - crazy chick from Bold and the Beautiful) suing him for custody, having been in rehab or something like that the film doesn't go into details of and the current custody order stating he can't endanger his kids with his work.  But guilt or letting innocents die or perhaps just hoping to get into the pants of Natasha Henstridge (Species, The Whole Nine Yards) who is leading the investigation, makes him reconsider, as long as it is kept on the quiet.

It was really a pretty lame thriller, near the start of the film I said out loud, I bet that's the bad guy and I was right.  Perhaps the original novel by Jeffery Deaver told the story a bit better but the movie was pretty average.",1494720000,,1843,4.198300283286119
