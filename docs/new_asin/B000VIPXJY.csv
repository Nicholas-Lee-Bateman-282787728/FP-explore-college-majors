8218872,2,B000VIPXJY,"""Trouble with Father"" ran from 1950 to 1955. There were lots of great, almost forgotten sit-coms on tv in that period (Life of Riley, Our MIss Brooks, etc.) but this is not one of them. Stu Erwin and real-wife June Collyer starred in this very weakly scripted show. Stu had the mug for comedy but he didn't have the comic talent. He never developed his character fully and you will be hard-pressed to find anything humorous about his portrayal of a happy family man/principal. His wife delivered her lines woodenly. The child actors are personality-free. The scripts are tedious. Racial stereotypes are of the Stepin Fetchit variety (in one episode, a black character is terrified of a biology class skeleton specimen). No wit, no slapstick, no comical characters, nothing. The show was cancelled when better shows came along. I love early tv but this show is not recommended. You can skip this one.",1411948800,,899,4.882352941176471
