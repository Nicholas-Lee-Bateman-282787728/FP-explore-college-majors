4371745,3,B004FZMDQ0,"Disappointing. This product is adevertised as a travelouge, but it is really not - rather than a documentary on preservation done by local people. Which still could have been interesting, but the dvd movie quality made it bad - even my small laptop screen shows huge number of grains and pixels. Till now I only watched Asia and Australia only and not feeling like watching other DVDs. The navigation on DVD menu is bad too, it does not respond many a time. Not recommended to anyone interested in travel videos. Not a bad choice for conservationist though, so giving it three star.",1356998400,3,582,4.715686274509804
4371746,2,B004FZMDQ0,"Just like the title says ""Nice Scenes but Poorly Narrated and Slow Moving""
There are a few awesome shots in HD but the narrator kinda sucks and they just show some scenes for like 60 seconds with bad music and no voice over.
Personally I would not purchase again.
In fact my copy is for sale on ebay it was that bad.
I will not be keeping this in my collection.",1352937600,10,361,4.098591549295775

8428471,4,B004FZMDQ0,"Five eco-tourist sites covering range of habitants namely jungle, mountains and beaches in South America. Fernando de Noronha in Brazil, Baja California in Mexico, Cost Rica, Chilean Patagonia and the Bahamas. DVD version for the blu-ray disc accompanies the package. The information for this type of travel package will not date as quickly as the local inhabitants are trying to preserve their heritage and therefore development is far more targetted to fit in with the environment.",1442793600,,483,5.368421052631579

8428476,4,B004FZMDQ0,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this CD very much but were extremely disappointed to learn that the 2-CD set, #1 and #2 were identical CDs, not 2 separate and different ones.  They listed Fiji, the Philippines, and a few other places on the menu so we thought those places would be covered on the second CD but they were not--the second CD was identical to the first!  It was such a disappointment because the first CD is absolutely outstanding--beautiful scenery and stories and we wanted it to continue.",1420502400,2,509,4.707865168539326

8428479,5,B004FZMDQ0,"I am really enjoying this Blu Ray.  The photography is first class the editing seamless, the music really good.  It is a French production in English, they linger over some of the scenes and don't need to keep talking at you.  Its like being there.  At the price its an absolute bargain any sensitive and intelligent person won't regret.  Very relaxing and enjoyable.

I've found fault with other products but can't find anything I didn't like about this.  I was thinking that there might be some advertorial, that is payments from the eco-lodges featured.  There certainly wouldn't have been from the Indian lodge in Costa Rica which was very basic, but coverage of the lodges is minimal unlike some TV travel shows which just feature high priced accomodation which means nothing to the average person.  The shows are designed to appeal to environmentally focused people, the professionalism is very high and the odd aerial shot would have to be paid for.

I've bought about 20 blu rays mostly of scenery this is one of the best.",1395014400,,1030,4.801136363636363
