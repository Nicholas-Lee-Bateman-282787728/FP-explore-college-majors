6583495,5,B00MJ9GF4U,"Contrary to what Amazon likes to think, the videos posted on this site have nothing to do with ""The Frank"".  They are about a dog.

This project, however, is something else entirely, and it's a departure from the ""riffing on a movie"" thing.  For those of us who pined horribly when TV's Frank left Mystery Science Theater 3000 to follow Torgo into Second Banana Heaven, this may be just what we've needed.  Frank is brought back to life by the mad scientist, (played by Trace Beaulieu) and we can once again play witness to the chemistry these two shared as comedians and cohorts in the past.  In those days, we just couldn't get enough of them, so it's more than fun to see them getting a chance to try a different angle.  Along for the craziness is a man who has been a part of it all for as long as I can remember, and he also made appearances in the Cinematic Titanic Live shows.  Dave Gruber,is formerly of ""The Higgins Boys and Gruber"" on the Comedy Channel.  This is one that needs to be on every Mistie's shelf and I am more than happy that I have mine!",1410134400,11,1061,4.296482412060302

8672743,1,B00MJ9GF4U,This should be a free give away with another item.  The video itself was uninteresting and WAAAY to short and the so called bonus material was just a waste of time.,1437350400,4,164,4.290322580645161
8672744,3,B00MJ9GF4U,"It kills me to give the MST3K guys 3 stars for anything, but the fact of the matter is that this is basically just a 15 minute music video. I put this on my wish list since I didn't feel like paying the $15 for such a short film. I appreciate the professional sets and costumes, but would really have preferred at least a semblance of a story or something other than just a video. Seems like a lot of effort for something so short. I bet more fans would purchase this at a lower price point ($5 maybe?)

That being said, the video itself is very well made and humorous. A definite oddity and must for any Mistie. It's good to see these guys making new stuff. I pray they keep it up!",1436745600,2,682,4.08955223880597
8672745,5,B00MJ9GF4U,"From the always-creative mind of Trace Beaulieu, comes a MST3K reunion of sorts in the short film ""The Frank"". Here an evil scientist (Beaulieu, of course) pines for his dear old friend, and reanimates Frank in a musical tribute of sorts to their collaborations of the past. Dave ""Gruber"" Allen assists as the mad scientist's peculiar butler, and other guest appearances abound (Bill Corbett, Mary Jo Pehl, J. Elvis Weinstein, etc.), which will satisfy the MST3K fan thoroughly despite the very short running time.

The DVD lets you choose to watch it in color or black and white, and also has a slide show and set construction time lapse that's interesting. I also loved the commercial for Trace's book ""Silly Rhymes for Belligerent Children"", but perhaps the best thing on the DVD was the interview conducted with Frank Conniff in Swedish, where he reveals he is scared of both ABBA and luggage, though not Al Pacino. (Just watch it and learn.)

""The Frank"" was a real treat for those of us who remember and miss MST3K, and despite the short running time, it's definitely worth the investment.",1436659200,2,1095,4.850267379679145

8672747,5,B00MJ9GF4U,"What an awesome, fun little film!  Trace and Frank, these guys should have their own TV show!  With cameos from MST3K alumni and a great song!  Hope to see more from Trace and Co.!",1418428800,3,180,4.235294117647059

8672751,4,B00MJ9GF4U,"Its my fault, I should have read the description more thoroughly.  Look, I love MST3K, Cinematic Titanic and Rifftrax.  And seeing Trace Beaulieu, Joel Hodgson, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl and Bill Corbett is worth the price of admission.  But 10 minutes?  I turned it on, sat down and it was over.  Like I said, its my fault for not having read the description clearly but I'm rather surprised that all these talents got together to do a 10 minute skit and release it on DVD.  On a positive note, the skit was rather entertaining, just too short.  Regardless, I like these guys so much that even this doesn't dampen my enthusiasm for them so,... 4 stars!!!",1411344000,27,657,4.564102564102564
