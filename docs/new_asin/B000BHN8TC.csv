8086883,3,B000BHN8TC,"For $32.00 I was expecting a little more.  I purchased the Basic Grooming 101 (see my review) hoping that if I purchased both DVD all aspects of grooming a dog would be covered.

As mentioned in my review of the first DVD the Tools of the Trade were not covered, dental maintenance, and ear grooming for hairy dogs.  On this DVD some tools were briefly covered however, not extensively.  In addition, how to the trim the tail of a Shih Tzu/Lhasa Apso were not discussed.  He did beautiful job grooming the dogs but more detail should have been provided for the price of these DVD.",1159142400,18,580,4.485714285714286
