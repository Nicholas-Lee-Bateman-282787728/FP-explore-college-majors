8592184,3,B00DDHFKIO,"Starting in the mid-1950s and continuing well into the next decade, both major and minor Hollywood studios cranked out frequent juvenile-delinquent dramas.  TEENAGE CRIME WAVE (a/k/a Teen-Age Crime Wave, Columbia, 1955) is typical of the lot in that it's watchable, but a far cry from REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  Terry (Molly McCart) is rounded up for trying to hustle a bar patron; through no fault of her own her friend Jane (Sue England) is arrested, too.  Both are headed for reform school when Terry's psychotic boyfriend Mike (Tommy Cook) springs them.  They flee into the country and hole up in a remote farmhouse, taking hostage the owners.  The movie can be watched here as a video-on-demand disc, or ""riffed"" (heckled) as part of volume 33 of the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 compilation series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-XXXIII/dp/B00VX2208Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000: XXXIII</a>.  Suffice it to say that the plot of this movie is sufficiently by-the-numbers to make for good satire at MST3K.",1489968000,2,1107,5.8875
8592185,4,B00DDHFKIO,"Not bad, typical mid 50's juvenile schlock flick.  Good girl Jane, innocently on a blind date with supposed friend bad girl Terry, gets inadvertently involved when her companions hold up and beat a victim.  The two girls get caught and sentenced to reform school, despite Jane's true and honest pleas about her own innocence in the matter.  Even her own parents won't believe her.  All they care about is the scandal and what their friends will think and say, and as such wash their hands of her.  WOW, talk about fair-weather parents.  On their way to kid-prison the two girls are sprung from custody by Terry's lit dynamite stick boyfriend, dragging a uncooperative Jane along.  They hole up at a farmhouse and hold the family hostage while they try to figure out what to do.  Not bad for this genre.  The Sony Pictures Choice Collection DVD-R is excellent quality but has no extras, just jumps right into the movie.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1460246400,,954,4.7272727272727275
