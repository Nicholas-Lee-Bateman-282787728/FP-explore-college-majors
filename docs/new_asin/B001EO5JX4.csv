8299022,4,B001EO5JX4,"This DVD presentation gives a lot of information about the RTI process in a short amount of time. I feel that the introduction, an explanation of the origins of RTI, was a little long-winded. The actual RTI process isn't even addressed until about halfway into the video, leaving only 15 minutes of discussion for the true topic. I also found a couple of elements in this video annoying: the camera zooms in unnaturally close on the speaker's face while he is talking, and the presentation uses cartoons to talk about students rather than actual kids. The information in this DVD is also readily available online for anyone who does a little research. That being said, this product is a fairly good presentation of the basics of RTI and better than anything else I've yet to find.",1284595200,2,780,4.742647058823529
8299023,5,B001EO5JX4,"Very informative video, especially the sections on the ""Discrepancy Model"" and the processes that schools are using to identify learning disabilities. As I am not a special education teacher, I was never really familiar with the actual requirements for being assigned to a learning support environment. This video gives a concise summary of the process and then describes the advantages of using RTI instead. One of the recurring themes of the program is that kids should be educated according to their specific needs and not based on arbitrary labels. I would recommend this video for anyone who is interested in learning more about evaluation options for special education programs, especially at the elementary level. -WM",1226534400,2,724,5.304347826086956
8299024,5,B001EO5JX4,"Not only does this DVD offer a perceptive analysis of the RtI concept, but it includes animations and insightful commentary which add valuable ""take-aways"" to the viewer's experience. This is a ""must see"" presentation for any educator or counselor dealing with kids who need special help.",1221868800,2,288,5.282608695652174
8299025,5,B001EO5JX4,"As a college student, I found RtI to be overwhelming to research out of books and on the internet. This DVD covers everything with a straightforward, comprehensible presentation. The animated representations of concepts make things very easy to understand while the narration goes over the specific details. I'd recommend this for any college students preparing to become teachers. It will give them a good basic understanding of RtI BEFORE they enter the workplace.",1219795200,5,466,5.397260273972603
8299026,5,B001EO5JX4,"I had a very hard time understanding the topic of RtI and many of the terms when trying to read about it, let alone how it would apply to a real-life classroom environment.  My first reaction to RtI was, ""Here we go again, just another flash-in-the-pan idea from Ivory Tower types who don't have a clue about teaching in a classroom and all the challenges teachers face on a daily basis.""

This video explains RtI in a very understandable, even entertaining fashion.  And this sure beats a lame PowerPoint presentation!",1219622400,,519,4.7444444444444445
