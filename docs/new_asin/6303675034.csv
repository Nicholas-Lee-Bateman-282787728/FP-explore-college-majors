704331,5,6303675034,I watched this movie when it first came out while I was living in Marina del Rey right out of high school. It's a great movie that touches on the feelings of being an outsider.  I can't wait to watch it again with my teenage son and with his siblings when they get a little older. Christian Slater gives an excellent performance and the sound track is still great,1478822400,,363,4.260869565217392

704333,5,6303675034,"This movie is over 25 years old now.  Yet the issues and ideas are still as true now as they were then.

The school in this movie had the finest SAT's in it's state.  The school had the finest students, for a very strong reason.  The retched principal weeded out those she saw as trouble makers - anyone below her ideas of excellence.  She looked for any excuse to expel trouble makers, and harassed countless others into dropping out. Those she labeled Losers, she didn't see as worthy of education.  All she cared about was her professional power and the schools elite reputation.

This movie has the cops and feds censuring personal use of Radio Transmissions.  That technology is obsolete, but the principle is still valid.  In every generation adults always attempt to prevent the young from having Freedom of Speech.  Harry's radio show let teens express themselves freely, and helped release their suppressed emotions.

This movie has numerous examples of the pain, confusion, helplessness, and hopelessness of High School.  Intense examples of how screwed up society is.

For all that it also offers hope - It demonstrates The Power of Personal Strength and Teen Rebellion.",1468454400,,1181,4.964285714285714
704334,5,6303675034,Back when Christian Slater was that dude. Classic movie with good music..,1461196800,,73,5.166666666666667

704337,5,6303675034,"Chugging his Cherry Diet Coke, chewing his Black Jack bubble gum, cueing up his outlaw music, anonymous shock jock Hard Harry, every night at 10pm, activates his pirate radio station and assaults the air waves of the tiny town of Paradise Valley, Arizona. He steals the air and talks hard, shattering the complacency of that staid community, transporting his listeners to a tizzy. For the oppressive authority figures - them bottom-line educators, them unctuous politicos, them deluded parents - our man Hard Harry - sometimes called ""Happy Harry Hard-On"" - signifies a burgeoning threat to status quo. But to the confused, disenfranchised, and marginalized teens of Paradise Valley, Harry is that seductive voice out of the dark, someone whose bawdy, vulgar rants may prove to not be panacea to their ills but who at least strongly empathizes with their lot. Hard Harry gets them, gets these kids. Maybe because Hard Harry is himself a kid.

His secret identity is that of teenager Mark Hunter who, in real life, is painfully shy, this awkward loner. Days go in which Mark wouldn't talk to anyone but his teachers. Mark is a recent transplant from back east, and his 'rents had bought him a short wave radio so that he could keep in touch with his old pals (except they proved to be out of range). So what's a budding malcontent to do to while away his evenings?

As Hard Harry's popularity waxes, so does the concern of the alarmed adults. They fear his influence. Because of Harry, the students of Hubert H. Humphrey High are acting out. But Harry hasn't even started yet. Soon, he'll expose the dark, seedy underbelly of his high school. As the news media circle like sharks, as the police crack down, as the FCC try to triangulate his broadcast signal, can Hard Harry keep talking hard? And can shy guy Mark Hunter step out of the shadow of his renegade alter ego?

I see Heathers (1988), and I see True Romance (1993). Still, this one is, hands down, my favorite Christian Slater movie. I was a young pup when Pump Up the Volume came out in 1990, and I've been in its thrall ever since. It's a movie that fiercely celebrates the freedom of speech. It demonstrates the impact of the spoken word, the power of the dissenting voice. Getting to the heart of the matter, it charts that sorry divide between teens and adults, that sad gap in communication between the two lots. Sure, it harps on the familiar plot of teens thwarting adult authority, of the youth's disillusionment warring with the grown-up's smugness. But Slater is mesmerizing. It's the best he's ever been. Fierce and funny and sexy, he compels whoever is watching the movie to keep watching the movie. The tone is dark and cynical and bleak, and yet moments of giddy triumph and sheer exhilaration pepper the screen. And it's mostly to do with the uncensored dialogue and Hard Harry's scathing delivery of it and a bit to do with the fantastical triumph of the underdog. And, yes, the monologues are frequently screamingly funny. I don't say that this movie explodes with heady truths. There is one advice that Harry gives, which is to just survive high school, just get past it. And, as someone who at times struggled with high school, I can get on board with that sage nugget.

If forced to take a dig at the movie, perhaps I'll say that whereas the teens are represented as real flesh-and-blood characters, the portrayal of the grown-ups borders on the caricature. The majority of the grown-ups here are oblivious or deluded or just plain dismissive of their youths. For example, the school's icy head administrator (Annie Ross) is so determinedly the heavy she falls just short of hissing and cackling. Ellen Greene's creative writing teacher plays the film's sole supportive AND understanding adult. Surely, the ratio isn't so skewed.

There are ample scenes of teen rage manifested here, and I'm so glad one of the most impactful revolves around a teenaged girl. Note that this pertinent girl isn't even Samantha Mathis, the female lead making her debut. Rather, it's supporting actress Cheryl Pollak. She plays the school's popular, over-achieving cutie-pie pupil who, on the inside, is railing at the stresses placed on her by her peers who want to be seen with her and by her father who wants to live vicariously thru her academic exploits. When Hard Harry urges his listeners to, uh, express themselves, Cheryl's character does so in memorable fashion. As for Samantha Mathis, she's memorable, too, as the flamboyant and candid Nora Diniro, Mark's classmate and the one person who finally gets thru to him.

Hard Harry, raw and inspirational, entreats you to eat cereal with a fork and do your homework in the dark. He invites you to tilt at windmills and slay giants. He treats you to bootleg tapes of Leonard Cohen, the Pixies, and the Beastie Boys and other champs of alternative music. So the soundtrack is dope. Crusty old man that I've slouched into, a part of me is tempted to scoff at all the teen angst. But the side of me that's still very much a fan of Slater's can't help but cheer him on and this movie on. And I recall the hellishness of high school, how tough it was and how mortifying. Pump Up the Volume, joyously raunchy and profane and rousing, keeps on being relevant. Give it a go, won't you? And let this phantom DJ show you his goods. Let him seep into you ""like a dirty thought in a nice clean mind.""

This DVD comes with these awesome bonus features:

- Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of the film
- Original Theatrical Trailer
- Cast & Crew Filmographies

On second thought, the bonus features, not so awesome.",1460160000,,5619,4.737218813905931

704407,5,6303675034,True classic which launched Slater into a cult of radio Dj's. True raw energy with high school peer pressure which most have suffered or excelled from.

704553,5,6303675034,"I've loved this movie since it came out almost 25 years ago.  Christian Slater plays alienated teen who takes to the airwaves on a shortwave radio set with a mixture of cool songs and plain talk about the struggles of teenage life and soon finds he has a following amongst his fellow students, which threatens the status quo at his tightly run high school.  Great soundtrack, acting and dialogue, the premise is interesting and even if it rushes to wrap things up at the end it doesn't go for the obligatory happy ending.  One of Christian Slater's best performances, which along with Heathers and True Romance had him at the top of young actors in the late 80's and early 90's.  He has several monologues in this which are terrific.  Not sure why this is out of print, but glad I got my copy.",1421539200,,793,4.479166666666667

704555,5,6303675034,"I'm wondering if Slater made a better film than this but I can't think of any. I think Pump Up the Volume is considered an independent film which would explain why it's not remembered by many. It might also be the considered the second film of the 1990s indie wave. That movie wave that started with Heathers and had Parker Posey as its reigning queen.

Anyways, lots of teen issues covered via a plot around a pirate radio station - all the rage in the late-80s. I'm not sure if Winona Ryder was to be in this but Mathis was perfect as Nora. Mimi Kennedy as Mark's (Slater) mom was great. The lead character was socially inept but able to speak out about serious issues as an radio DJ. It was a good way to include Mark into the group of misfits who dominated his fan-base. Slater actually played this character, not himself. Not everyone in this did any breakthrough acting. But they did act as though it was real, in a DeGrasse High style. Annie Ross who played the principal did ham it up a bit. I'll allow it!

It has good looking leads, decent acting, relatable situations, and a stick-it-to-the-man ending. Watch it!",1416787200,,1123,4.4731707317073175

He quickly learns that he has more followers than he anticipated, and that his messages were being heard, and then carried out!  It's an intense ride into the minds of teens as they try to discover who they really are, and where they fit into society.  The soundtrack adds a lot of zest to the film, featuring underground acts such as: Leonard Cohen, Bad Brains, Pixies, The Descendents, Sonic Youth, Cowboy Junkies, Was Not Was, Urban Dance Squad, Liquid Jesus, Concrete Blonde & The Beastie Boys!

The kids who listen, are never sure when he'll broadcast, or what the subject matter might be, but it always creates a buzz of excitement in the crowd listening. Naturally, the school they all hate so much, tries desperately to find the source of this devilment, because the crowd against the local high-schools policies, grows with each broadcast.

Also it is better then Heathers because the ending monologue is much more positive.

When it comes to the Gen X flicks everyone thinks of, The Breakfast Club, Singles, Reality Bites... Pump Up the Volume deserves to be in the club.  Luckily PUTV is already something of a cult classic and so shall not disappear!

Also This is Christian Slaters best flick.  He is so cool.  He always has some hot brunette love interest too.  Samantha Mathis in this one.  Other flicks have had Marisa Tomei and Milla Jovovich.

Even the supporting cast in this flick are good.  There are a whole bunch of secondary characters and spending and evening watching PUTV and seeing Mazz, Paige, and Janie is like seeing some old friends.

To top everything off PUTV has a great sound-track as well!",1314576000,,837,4.664383561643835

704749,4,6303675034,"Having watched this again for the second time in my life I have to say that I'm surprised at how well this film holds up. Notice - I called it a film and not a movie. The last time I saw this was in a dark theatre the weekend it was released in 1990. Christian Slater probably delivers his most memorable performance yet in this film despite the popularity of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers/dp/B000059PPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers </a>&nbsp;which is actually dominated by Winona Ryder.

""Pump up the Volume"" was an underground hit and must-see VHS rental for about 10 years for anyone who was listening to grunge, a teenager, trapped inside a suburban nightmare or just feeling isolated. The idea of the system being inaccessible, out-of-touch and overt and too much in-your-business still resonates just as strong today as it did then.

Strangely, ""Pump up the Volume"" is one of the best and seminal `John Hughes' style Teen Eighties movies from that era and being released in 1990, might just make it the last. The previous year produced the much darker book-end to that style with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-a-Little-Dream/dp/B0000C3I99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream a Little Dream</a>, but ""Pump up the Volume"" trumps it well and seemingly closes the door on High School forever, or at least until the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brick/dp/B000FVQM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brick</a>&nbsp;in 2005 or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Accepted/dp/B000IZJZIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Accepted</a>&nbsp;in 2006.

Overall, a good movie, worth seeing again even though some of the soundtrack is severely dated. The Pixies ""Wave of Mutilation"" holds strong though and delivers a nice montage sequence mid-way through the film, making a nice comment of suburban blight.",1201651200,28,1990,6.587786259541985
704750,5,6303675034,"This movie is not just a ""cliche"" of teenagers not being understood by their parents. It is more than that, and has different levels. Try to understand the differences between living in the city and a very small old fashioned town in the States; and how much it affects an adolescent the moving out from one to another, and how to canalize the psychological effects.
On the other hand the adolescence is a very interesting period of our lives in which we are looking for our own identity and personality (not an easy thing); and you can easily be influence by anyone who seems to have an answer, which in the movie Happy Harry doesn't really have many answers, but at least encourages people to look for them, and not just do what you're told to do, and live a stereotype kind of life (like the perfect ""A"" girl), yes...?.
On another point you can see the typical disturbed administration and teachers of many schools, criticized in videos like Pink Floyd's magnificent ""Happiest days of our lives"", in Pump Up the Volume is criticized and beaten in the same way (beat the system with a good proposal is a nice fantasy to fight for...). You can see the different kind of parents we all have. The different kind of classmates we are. You can also see the way a person can act when is protected by being anonymous. Also there's a very deep meaning in the sentence Harry says: ""look what the sixties did to them"" or something like that: it means that most of those revels whit out a cause or stoned hippies ended up being, is just a corporate employee or part of the system they were ""fighting"" in the beginning; so, as I said the movie has different levels and it is a very good one.

704812,4,6303675034,"ok, I will admit it. This is one of my favorite movies ever. We can all concur for the most part that Christian Slater just stinks in almost every film, but in this role, it was as if the script God's were looking down upon him and well they gave him his crown jewel. Arguably the best film Slater has been in, perhaps saving 'Interview With a Vampire', however I think even Billy Boyd would have been good in that role, so enough said.

Anytime I need some uplifting strides, or I hear the call for inspiration in one form or another, I will throw Pump Up The Volume in, and even though it can be a bit over the top in some areas, there are moments of exceptional purity and realism in Slater's character, nevermind countless memorable quotes, to pronounce one of my favorites that opens the film if you will so let me:

""You ever get the feeling that everything in America is completely ***** up. You know that feeling that the whole country is like one inch away from saying 'That's it, forget it.' I mean think about it. Everything is polluted. The environment, the government, the schools you name it. Speaking of schools, I was walking the hound halls the other day and I asked myself, ""Is there life after high school?"" Because I can't face tomorrow, let alone a whole year of this sh**. Yeah, you got it folks. It's me again with a little attitude for all you out here in Whitebread Land. All you nice people living in the middle of America the beautiful. Lets see, we're on er 92 FM tonight and it feels like a nice clean little band so far. No one else is using it. The price is right. Heh, heh. And yes folks you guessed it. Tonight I am as horny as a ten peckered owl, so stay tuned because this is Happy Harry Hardon reminding you to eat your cereal with a fork and do your homework in the dark.""

Crisp voice, surreal opening, haunting even. Slater is surely endearing in this role. I really can't see anyone doing this except him. There are so many younger folks I give this to and they simply consider it one of the best movies ever, and why not? It's fun, it's energetic, it's chuck full of inspiration to give every kid out there an idea to do whatever is in their heart, no matter what the odds are or the consequences if you believe in the idea enough.

Not to mention a soundtrack that was one of the first tapes I played in my first car, over and over and over again. Leonard Cohen I mean honestly, just simply stunning. And the cameos, a plethora.

704815,2,6303675034,"Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth.",1128816000,4,1607,4.86080586080586

Was it worth it? Yes. I am a straight married guy, and a huge fan of Christan Slater. I have seen damn near every movie with him in it, and Pump was another classic.

The story is held together with a tour-de-force performance from Christian Slater as the jaded jock, turned reform crusader, exposing the shortcomings of his school behind his anonymous veneer of Hard Harry.

It's a bit talky and a bit too clever at times, but it's earnest in its feelings about free speech and concerns about corruption in leadership, a message that seems even more timely today than it did when the film first appeared in theaters.

704917,3,6303675034,"Christian Slater is Mark Hunter, a nerdy Eastern transplant to an Arizona school.  Completely overlooked by his easy-going parents and everybody else, Hunter runs a pirate radio station under the name ""Hard Harry"".  Every night, the hordes of students who think nothing of Hunter, listen for every syllable of Harry's voice.  Hunter laces his subversive radio with mixtures of Lenny Bruce and the likes of ""Concrete Blond"", and everybody loves it.  Everybody that is but the stern,  authoritarian and uptight nerds who live for nothing but make life miserable for everybody younger than they are.  Hunter is a man with ideas, but he can only express them through Harry - he alters his voice for radio, and uses an anonymous mail box to collect fan mail - keeping his double life a secret.  Unfortunately, Nora (Samantha Mathis), an introverted intellectual teen who works the library at Hunter's school, pieces together the clues of Hunter's & Harry's shared ID.
Until then, ""Pump"" is sheer fun, an equal opportunity offender that doesn't strain your sense of morality.  The adults are easy targets (even Hunter's parents are out  to lunch - they never realize that their son's got enough electronic equipment to be the ""Hard Harry"" that everybody is talking about; the rest of the adults fail to consider Harry's message as a wake-up call).  But the teens are also pretty wasted - for all of their energy, they never convert their power into a cause (the script wakes up near the end, and crafts a genuine cause involving manipulation of student scores - a revelation hit on by a ""friendly"" teacher played by Ellen Greene of ""Little Shop of Horrors"" fame).  Instead of rising up against some perceived evil, Hunter's fellow teens merely become louder versions of the same annoying and cliquish high schoolers that we've seen in countless flicks (typically starring Corey's Feldman & Haim, and Larry Linville or Mary Woronov as the evil principal).  Even after essentially telling his listeners what kind of person he really is, none seek him out.  They're not after Hunter's reality, only Harry's wicked construction.  It's good clean fun, and Harry's rants are so irresistible, you'd be willing to sit through about 2 hours of it.  Though Hunter/Harry talks to the disaffection of Teen-America, little in the surrounding setting bears out how much trouble we're in (clue: though a bastion of adult-managed conformity, Hunter's school still keeps the library stocked with Lenny Bruce).
Unfortunately, in true shock-jock tradition, Harry/Hunter's words become entangled with tragedy when a local teen commits suicide shortly after calling in.  Faster than you can say ""Good Morning Vietnam"", Hunter dumps than resurrects Harry's persona - only now he's on a mission, and ""Pump"" becomes more serious than it proves to deserve.  Still missing the genuine story underneath the story, the teens become louder, and the adults more repressive (one of the teens is brutally assaulted by one of the school's employees) and the script more satisfied with how it delivers Harry's message than how it can convincingly craft one.  At that point, ""Pump"" transforms from an engaging comedy into a weighed-down message movie, one that spoils the fun of both halves.  By the end, you feel like you've been watching less of a movie, than a really long and loud ""After School Special"".",1088121600,2,3367,5.067028985507246

Christian Slater stars as Mark Hunter a shy and introverted studious teenager by day who is harboring a secret identity from everyone else. Hunter has recently moved to the Arizona city of Paradise Valley and is attending the local high school Hubert Humphrey High, where all the students are at odds with the hardnosed bully of a principal. To combat both his own awkward attempts at conversations with fellow students (especially girls) and the intensely disliked principal, Mark becomes a pirate DJ using his short-wave radio his parents gave him for a gift. Behind the microphone and closed doors Mark becomes 'Hard Harry' who lives and breathes his motto ""Talk Hard"" nightly beginning at 10 sharp. His alternately bellicose and sanguine rants become 'a voice crying in the wilderness' for the students at HHH and overnight 'Hard Harry' becomes a hometown celebrity that has everyone at the high school talking about him. Suddenly the teenagers that were growing complacent and resigned to the rules, regulations and restrictions enforced upon them begin to liberate themselves. Students play their recorded tapes of his broadcast on boom boxes during the school lunch hour and they become the bane of the teachers who dislike the uncensored monologues, especially the putdowns of the teachers and principal who are named on the broadcasts. But when one of the callers to 'Hard Harry' commits suicide, the high school's core of leadership blame him for provoking the incident. The students naturally rebel against this unjust condemnation of their ""hero of the airwaves"" and begin expressing their indifference to the school officials. When it becomes a full-blown anarchy the local authorities and the FCC are called in to track 'Hard Harry' down and get him off the air leading to a final confrontation between the teenagers and the adults.
Slater is cast perfectly as 'Hard Harry' and he steals the entire proceedings, far outshining any of the others in the movie. All of the teenagers are well cast and are entirely believable throughout the picture, but they remain mostly undefined with the exception of Samantha Mathis who plays Slater's love interest. Still director Allan Moyle ('Empire Records') creates an honest portrait of teen life as less than idyllic and somewhat cold. Teens are shown as being trapped within believable personal hells, problematic circles of existence and strained family relationships. While these seem like expected clichs in movies about teen angst Moyle gets his cast to bring them off with conviction. This practical approach doesn't get carried over to the adults however. Instead the student's rebellion is shown to be against an abhorrent and corrupt school administration run by heartless teachers and frigid officials wielding a cruel authority. At one point a school official (depicted in one-dimensional and unintentional hilarity) beats an expelled student who has come by the school to say he has the right to an education. Of course this happens in front of the entire student body during lunch hour and this incident sets off a riot at the school and results in the police and eventually the FCC getting involved. Why has Moyle created such an obvious juxtaposition of forces? The answer is simple...Hollywood doesn't take on 'the system'.  Anti-establishment films are the forte of independent filmmakers and there are many such fine films out there worth searching out. In New Line Entertainment's 'Pump Up The Volume' Moyle is able to push the envelope only so far before he is forced to feel the constraints of an authority figure telling him ""NO!"" - ironically in much the same way the teens in the movie do!
Another small problem with the film has to do with the character of 'Hard Harry'. Early on he rants on-air about the 60's radicals and the protests they incited, their collective disillusionment and anger against ""the system"" and how ""they were gonna' change the world."" He observes that they weren't anything but a lot of wind and that in fact nothing has changed. Yet 'Hard Harry' is so obviously a composite of Lenny Bruce and Abbie Hoffman that this sentiment is improperly placed here; during the early part of the film Slater reads Bruce's 'How To Talk Dirty And Influence People' and he sounds, acts and expresses himself exactly like a 60's radical. He's supposedly raving like this because of his personal disappointment with his parents, former 60's radicals now Ma & Pa 'yuppie'. Logically I suppose an inexperienced and wet-behind-the-ears teen would make such outlandish statements while being exactly what he is condemning but it still seems false and insensible.
Still the film is well worth seeing for Slater's terrific star-making performance; when he urges the students to buck the societal conventions being pressed down upon them and suggests alternatives to conformity, he does so in such an honest, rational, likable - albeit profane - way that it's a genuine crowd pleasing moment. And despite my misgivings about some of the content of this film I still recommend a viewing because of it's stance against the oppression of censorship and also the great upbeat and fist-pumping ending - and Slater has one of the best closing lines in any film you'll see. 80's music aficionados will also appreciate the well-chosen songs that make up the superb soundtrack.",1045353600,8,5563,5.065430752453653

704965,4,6303675034,"As a dvd I am a bit disapointed. No extras, no commentary, nothing. So I won't talk about it as a dvd.
As a film, this is one of my favorite movies. Overlooking some of the problems it has with being realistic, it is one of Slater's stronger roles, and the type of role he plays well. The film attempts to tackle many issues, foremost being censorship. Whether or not it does a good job, I leave that you to decide. The movie also tries to be the 'voice' of a generation. And while it has a lot to say, has become a cult classic, and is full of great sound bites, I don't think the film achieved all the filmmakers set out to do. But it is an entertaining movie that gives you a lot to think about.",1028160000,,698,4.028776978417266

She tracked down this elusive underground DJ and made him hers. She just seemed pretentious and overbearing to me. I appreciate the sentiment of the film. Christian Slater is good as the underground DJ running an independent radio station, but of course, things get out of hand and his advice triggers some rather unfortunate events. The escalation of events is so unrealistic and silly, though, that I have to wonder about why this was so popular. I guess it was popular with young people because they like to feel like they have power or a voice. Or they like to be portrayed as though they do.

704967,4,6303675034,"Pump Up The Volume is probably one of the first of the ""Gen X"" movies to appear in the wake of the John Hughes classics of the early and mid-80s.  This film, released in 1990, touches on a myriad of issues that effect teens today as then.  They don't seem to make movies like this anymore, movies that touch on serious issues as isolation, alienation, sexuality, education reform, freedom of speech, censorship, suicide, the failure of mandatory standardized scholastic testing, etc etc.  This movie has got it all.  The story revolves around a quiet student at Hubert Humphrey High, a large suburban school in Arizona.  His parents are sell-out former hippies who have produced in him a resentment of the failed idealistic values of the 60s generation which have created a fallout whose repercussions are still felt today.  Mark is a loner who cannot communuicate with his teachers or his peers.  He is an intelligent and creative recluse who eats his lunch alone, reading a book, while the problems of high school life swirl around him.  It is only as his secret pirate radio alter-ego Hard Harry that he finds his voice and is able to speak to those diseffected peers who share his fate at a school that reflects the flawed and conformist society at large that has not only overlooked the problems of his generation, but continues to add to them by treating the kids as second-class citizens.  The school princial, who is obsessed with standardized test scores and the prestige of her school, flags ""problem"" students who threaten to tarnish school image and pull down test scores and has them expelled rather than try to help these kids who truly need help, while the school councelor rats out these same students to the corrupt administration when he should be the one providing them with the guidance they need.  And to make matters worse, the one concerned teacher who dares to stand up for her students is fired for insubordination.  As Hard Harry begins to make an impact, other afflicted students begin to open up with their problems to an outlet thatn is genuine and not some contrived school-sponsered joke.  Harry confronts a isolated over-achiever who takes his own life rather than face another day at his ""award-winning"" school.  Another caller describes an incident of homophobic violence commited by the school jocks.  In the end, Harry finds he must face his problems without his mask of anonyimity and face up to being the icon of hope that he has become.  Pump Up the Volume is a fine movie with a great soundtrack and speaks to alot of the issues that plauge us in this post-Columbine age.  It is defiantely one to watch.",1012780800,11,2643,4.788546255506608

704969,5,6303675034,"Long before ""The people vs. Larry Flint"" or Howard Stern's ""Private Parts"" addressed the problem of censorship imposed by  the U.S. government on media personalities and products, there was ""Pump Up The Volume."" ""Pump Up The Volume"" varies from the Flint and Stern movies in that it is not glorifying a specific person (i.e. Flint and Stern, who just coincidently happen to gain publicity and movie proceeds).
  The star of this fictional movie is Christian Slater, who plays the role of Mark, a painfully shy teenager. To release his anxieties, Mark goes on-air on a short-wave radio as Hard Harry, a perverted, obnoxious, but surprisingly philosophical radio personality. Mark's way to unwind ends up turning the town upside down, effecting both his peers and the administration at his high school.
  This movie does not stop at the issue of censorship; it tackles three social issues in all, including the struggle of being a teenager submerged in American culture and how power can corrupt adults whose very job is to protect the young.
  Although this movie is fictional, the superb acting of its young thespians make it seem more realistic than either Flint's or Stern's accounts. Indeed, Pump Up The Volume will not only entertain the viewer, but also leave the viewer thinking.",1002153600,16,1285,5.033018867924528

There's a sub plot of an evil principal who throws out all 'unwanted' students, but does not report that to the board of education, vs. a 'good' younger teacher...
This is based on a very good idea, and is given from a high schooler's point of view with all of it's cynicism yet ideology. But there are a few weak points, like the fact that the principal is portrayed as all evil, the young teacher is all good, and is not asked for much proof before her accusations against the principal are taken as the truth.",999561600,2,824,4.32258064516129

Pump Up the Volume is different, practically transcendent for the genre. Christian Slater gives his best performance as a teenage shock-jock on a pirate radio station who exposes the seedy, corrupt underbelly of life in banal, hypocritical middle America.
Slater's character, ""Hard Harry,"" mixes juvenile jokes with political and social satire, proving mesmerizing to suburban kids in cardboard cutout communities. Of course, the injection of truth into a land ruled by lies leads to a massive reaction from parents, the school principal and even the feds.
The movie also touches on the issues of teen suicide, school testing and the freedoms that our society is supposed to represent but rarely does.

Slater is very convincing as ""Hard Harry"" a young boy who runs a pirate radio-show and turns out to be a silent and shy person as soon as he's among other kids. Samantha Mathis (in her first starring role) is equally good as his girlfriend-to-be who turns out to be a little rebel herself.
Another positive thing about this movie is the nicely chosen soundtrack which crosses almost all kinds of music from Henry Rollins to Leonard Cohen.
Overall a definite must-see for all friends of teen-movies, although this is not really the kind of comedy you might be used to watch since it's also got some serious elements in it.

705035,5,6303675034,"As an angst-ridden teenager much like Mark (AKA Hard Harry), I worshipped this film when I was in high school, often referring to it as ""THE Teen Movie""...not just A teen movie.  In a lot of ways, I was a lot like Mark.  I couldn't talk to people, either.  I felt really connected with the character and marvelled at the guts the film had in portraying serious subject matter and dealing with it in an intelligent, believable manner.  When I look at the so-called teen films of today, I miss the real edge of films like ""Pump Up the Volume"" and ""The Breakfast Club.""  These were the teen films that truly mattered...the ones that had something important to say.  ""Pump Up the Volume"" personifies that genre, as far as I'm concerned...even moreso than ""The Breakfast Club,"" which, despite its brilliance, occasionally (though not frequently) lapsed into unbelievable situations.  And to the reviewer who asked what was wrong with Hubert H. Humphrey High School, just look at the actions of the principal...that should clear it up.  Students were being expelled on specious grounds simply because she considered them ""unfortunate.""  This is why she was eventually (and thankfully) suspended from her administrative position.  The school was an absolute travesty.  It was this, coupled with Mark's feelings of alienation and isolation, that drove him to such extremes in his all-too-perceptive rants.  Mark invented Hard Harry so that he could say all of the things he truly felt, but felt unable to say himself.  I did the same thing in school, inventing an alter-ego for myself who could stand up for himself and say whatever was on his mind.  I didn't use pirate radio, of course...I just went out into the world in my new persona and found that people actually started to listen...just like they listened to Mark when he became Harry.  All in all, this film made a serious impact on my life and has many important things to say to people of any age...and especially to teens.  The performances are stunning all around, particularly Christian Slater (in his finest role) and Samantha Mathis (who is equally capable and absolutely perfect in the role of Nora).

He tells the stories of how corrupt the school is, and how the principle meistreats the students to raise her standing. Christan Slater plays this role beautifly, showing people not to back down and to ""Talk Hard"".
I know I am repeating myself but, this is just a great flick and is so worth seeing. The DVD atleast had a trailer and cast list, which is minimal, but is exeptable. I hope for a Special Edition, with a message from the stars, but that is just wishful thinking.
