5562780,5,B00B846BX2,"Callanetics is a work out unlike any other I have tried. I have chronic back pain and this is the only program that has helped me strengthen the supporting muscles to my spine without causing increased pain. She takes great care in guiding you into the correct position before you begin each exercise, so as not to put further strain on your spine. It is a core strengthening program that tones your deep muscles with just the slightest bit of movement once you get into position. I found positive results in the first week. Hghly Recommend this program not only for those who have back issues but also for those who want to strengthen their back to prevent possible future injuries!",1368576000,9,683,4.652892561983471
5562781,5,B00B846BX2,Had all the Callanetics videos and used them with great result.  Now that I am older and out of shape wanted to do Callanetics again.  Thank God for Amazon - found my favorite ones in DVD and immediately bought them.  This one has great exercises do do at night and by the end you are really relaxed and ready for sleep.  Callanetics is the best low impact exercise I have found - it is great for older folks like me - the inches and weight comes off without injury,1368316800,12,465,4.191011235955056
5562782,5,B00B846BX2,"It's hard to establish an exercise routine when you're a college student and work full-time, like me. 20 minutes in the morning and then 20 minutes after work do make a difference!
At first I couldn't do the leg exercises but after one week I could do them with no problem, and the pain I felt on my knees while sitting or walking in completely GONE! I'm really glad I got this!",1367971200,9,378,4.263888888888889
5562783,5,B00B846BX2,"I use to do Callanetics in my younger years when I was busy working outside the home and raising 3 children.  I am about 20 pounds overweight.
I am choosing to get back into this wonderful way of improving the body that is not hard on the joints, builds strength, reshapes and tone muscles which in turn burns calories and makes you look and feel confidently good!",1366329600,3,364,4.432835820895522
5562784,5,B00B846BX2,"This is a wonderful alternative to the original 60 minute callanetics, especially if you pressed for time. It lives up to its claims, it works fast, feels great on your body, it's almost addicting actually. I also run so exercising in the am and pm everyday is not an option, so I break my routine into four or six days. Mon. is am Tues. pm, Wedn. off Thurs. am and Fri. pm. If it's 6 days I include Sat. and Sun. Even with this routine I noticed the results in two weeks (160 min. of callanetics)particularly legs behind and stomach. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Your fitness level and stretching ability are virtually irrelevant.",1327276800,5,641,4.5344827586206895
5562785,5,B00B846BX2,"Even though I adore Callanetics and have done it on and off for the last 10 years, I never seemed to be able to stick to it long enough for those promissed results to show. I just can't stick to a routine which takes an hour at a time, as the original program does - I just can't stay focused that long!
So here's where the Am/Pm program comes in! In my opinion, it's the best off all the Callanetics programs - and I have them all!! It is the only program  that I have EVER been able to stick to.
I can easily motivate myself to do these short programs twice a day, 3-5 times a week. They only last 20 minutes and time just flyes by!
I do the Am program first thing in the morning, and start my day of feeling great! The Pm program I do shortly before bedtime, because it leaves me so relaxed, I could fall asleep right there on the floor!
But best of all: it really does deliever those results promissed.
My posture has improved, my tummy is flatter, my hips are narrower, my legs leaner, I'm more flexible and I am not nearly as tence in my back, shoulders and neck as I usually would be.
Another great thing about the program is, that all the exercises are show with different modifications, so the program will challenge you whether your'e a beginner or experienced exerciser.",1225152000,30,1281,4.25

 very boring - little or no challenge February 20, 2001
It's probably just me - perhaps I should have NOT purchased this tape. I was looking for a video that would really help me ""jump-start"" my day. I found this to be really boring, the movements quite basic and Callen's personality very cloying. This might be a wonderful relaxation tape, but I do not see the effect I was hoping for.
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THIS POST BARELY MADE A DENT IN THE 4.5 STARS THIS VIDEO GOT REVIEWS FOR.
ALL OF CALLAN PINCKNEY'S VIDEOS ARE AMAZING AND YOU GET IMMEDIATE RESULTS. ALL OTHER WORKOUT VIDEOS CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET CANNOT COMPARE!
MY ADVICE TO ""BARBPL"": TRY IT AGAIN, OR TRY ONE OF HER OTHER VIDEOS. YOU WERE NOT FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ""T"" IF YOU FELT OR SAW NO RESULTS. UNLESS YOU PREFER TO JUMP AROUND ALOT AND HAVE FAST MUSIC (BUT GET NO RESULTS)THAN THIS WASN'T FOR YOU.",1088467200,12,1070,4.459183673469388
5562787,5,B00B846BX2,"This is 2 complete 20 minute workouts, and it's the gentlest of the available Callanetics videos. It makes an excellent introduction to this unique method, and good for people with not much time to spare. Another added benefit (and this is especially true of the PM section), is that it's wonderfully soothing, and if you're feeling anxious or stressed, Callan's soft and gentle voice, guiding you through these slow motions, will help release any tension, and calm the nerves. If you're the type that needs a lot of ""bounce and flash"" to get you motivated, Callanetics is not for you...this is indeed ""meditation in motion""...the exercises can be very difficult if done correctly, but everything is done quietly and in ""triple slow motion"".
A note to anyone who like me, has weak or problem knees: You may have to modify your movements in the ""Pelvic Weave"" and ""Front Thigh Stretch"" in the AM workout, and in the ""Pelvic Rotation"", ""Pelvic Scoop"", and again the ""Front Thigh Stretch"" in the PM portion. Go at your own pace, and you'll find your knees getting stronger quite rapidly. I was amazed to find that I could kneel and sit on my heels after only 3 weeks...it has been decades since my knees had the agility to do this.
Strength and flexibility are the 2 major benefits I've received so far in the few weeks I've been doing these exercises, and why I would recommend Callanetics to anyone over 40. These are the 2 things we start to lose with age that make us ""old"", and contribute to accidents and ill health. I've also noticed some body shape changes, but it's the feeling of well being that I value more than anything...and the ability to stretch like I haven't been able to do in years.
Callan says of this tape that you'll feel energized with the AM, and relaxed with the PM, and have ""a great body 24 hours a day"". Thank you Callan, for inventing a system that I look forward to doing on a daily basis, and that is making a profound difference in my life.",1026345600,172,1970,4.567796610169491
5562788,5,B00B846BX2,"I am a swimmer and do Tae-Bo regularly. I LOVE AM/PM Callanetics! The program leaves me feeling so strong and stretched, and my back (always a bad point for me) feels relaxed and free.
Some of the reviews below and for other Callanetics tapes say that the exercises are too easy. I felt this way for a long time too, but have since realized that it was because my back was doing the work instead of my legs. Once I got stronger and got my legs working, the exercises are both difficult and immensely effective. If you want to be strong and sleek, this is what you need!",993513600,35,569,4.277777777777778
5562789,4,B00B846BX2,"A quick 20 minutes with soft spoken Callan.  Sort of like a moving mediation.  There is little difference however between the AM and PM routines.  I was into Callanetics in the 80s. Forgot, as she warns, that these exercises may seem simple but they are intense for the body. I had to back up and go to the Chiropractor.  You have to ease into it.  And effective, YES.",1506124800,,368,4.352941176470588

Young, old, physically disabled, back problems, knee problems, overweight, extremely overweight... these are the ticket to getting you back to feeling and moving better. And quickly. Callan Pinckney had some of these very problems herself when she designed these exercises for her own health. I have used them with my own health issues and seen dramatic differences, very quickly. I have used them since the 80s. I keep coming back to them time and time again.

5562798,5,B00B846BX2,"I bought this a set with Quick Callanetics, Super Callanetics, and the original Callanetics workout.  As I stated in my reviews for the other products, I have been doing this workout on and off for about 10 years.  It is very effective to tone and tighten up quickly.  It's a good workout, and I always feel very calm and relaxed, yet energized afterwards.  If you are unfamiliar with Callanetics, it is like a combination of yoga, pilates and dance stretches.  I do break a sweat, and it takes a couple of months before I can do the whole thing without having to take breaks, but it is not as uncomfortable to do indoors as the treadmill or aerobics.  I alternate this with walking in the park and gym workouts.  Although I have the books and the VHS, it was time to get the DVDs.",1474934400,4,781,4.381944444444445

5562833,5,B00B846BX2,"This is the perfect exercise video for people who hate to exercise yet know they need to.  Twenty minutes in the morning, twenty at night, and you see results immediately, and that is very encouraging.  It is very relaxing, and she constantly reminds you to relax all the areas you are not exercising. I didn't know how much unneeded stressing I was doing before learning this method. If you remember that it was recorded in the early '90's, the fashion and decor don't seem so strange. Some people have criticized that there aren't enough reps...well, after you have mastered the exercises there is time to do more while she is discussing technique.  I find the morning session to be energizing and the night session to be relaxing.  I have done the night session 2 hours before bed with no difficulty going to sleep. In fact, my only criticism is that the music tempo increases right after the last p.m. exercise; I always want to just stay relaxed on the floor and find the tempo change abrupt to the point that I get up and turn it off, breaking the relaxed feeling.  I started Callanetics with the Beginning Callanetics video and recommend that for people who have not exercised regularly and for technique.  After I mastered that, I moved on to AM/PM Callanetics which has become my daily routine.  I don't have an exercise bar but you don't need one, just sturdy furniture and a doorway with a cushion to sit on for the Open/Close exercise.  I highly recommend this to anyone who needs some motivation to exercise.

On the extremely positive side, I've been working with a Pilates DVD on my own, and managed to hurt one of my shoulders a couple of weeks ago. The pain has been steady since then.

5562909,5,B00B846BX2,"I have the original Callanetics DVD (the one with the blue cover, which I also reviewed positively) and thought I'd compare this to that for those who want to know the difference. But first, let me say that I LOVE Callanetics and sing its praises to anyone who will listen. I'm a 44 year old woman who recently lost about 25 pounds by switching to a Primal diet (which works too). I was close to my target weight but needed some definite firming and toning of things that were long since flabby. I've been in good shape before when I was younger but got lazy since I had my son 5 years ago. I've had herniated discs in my low back which are much better now thanks so spinal decompression, but still am cautious about putting too much pressure back there. I stumbled on Callanetics and  am thankful daily that I did. The results are fast, as promised. Mine are a stomach flat enough to wear snug tee shirts again without being self conscious, NO back fat, much smaller rear end and hips, and lean, hard thighs. Shoulders and arms are nice and toned too. I just finished my 20th workout today, but started noticing results the first few times I did it.

Oh, and by the way, if you're new to exercise and start Callanetics you will be SORE. And I mean SORE. But that's good because you know it's working as promised.

So here's how this DVD compares to the original: most of the exercises are the same, just in a different order. Personally, I didn't feel that there was a good flow here like in the original where it seemed that you worked an area, then stretched it. It felt intuitively correct. In this DVD, it seemed as if they just split it up to get the right amount in the AM as in the PM portion. Not saying it's bad, just different. I still find both relaxing to do. Oddly, I was quite sore after doing the AM/PM DVD even though I'd ceased being sore (for the most part) from the other. Same exercises, just a different order. Interesting that that could cause soreness.

There are fewer reps in this DVD, but they do tell you what to work up to. So it seems this may be more of a ""beginner's"" Callanetics than the original.

There is a seated position leg/hip exercise in here that's not in the original, but it was hard for me to do without the proper leverage (they used a suspended bar in the DVD) so I skipped it anyway. Not a big deal because they only did a few reps. Also, there were stomach exercises in the AM portion AND the PM portion so you would be doing them twice a day, instead of just once like in the original, although there were fewer reps so you would be doing the same amount overall as in the original. There were a couple of leg stretches left out of this DVD, but a new hamstring stretch done laying done I think replaced it and felt highly effective. And lastly, one of the leg exercises (where you slowly lower yourself then come back up), was left out of here that was on the original. But the other one that's similar - but with added pelvic rolls - has a few additional reps that seemed to make up for it.

So it's a good DVD, especially if you're pressed for time. You still get pretty much all the great exercises from the original that give you results. Having said that, if you do the original DVD enough you can memorize it quickly and do it in about 40 minutes. Then you could split it up yourself for your own AM/PM version. I plan to do both DVDs and just rotate them, as it keeps me from getting bored with the same routine, and seeing the same people on there. Callan Pinckney is quietly encouraging without being pushy...I think she's brilliant to have come up with such a deceptively simple yet effective way of shaping your body.",1377907200,43,3679,4.309248554913295

though I can't do all the reps,I have hope!",1376006400,3,181,3.918918918918919

5562915,3,B00B846BX2,Found this quick and easy to do at home. Unfortunately due to work schedule haven't had the time to truly test this DVD out.,1375574400,,124,4.208333333333333
5562916,4,B00B846BX2,Callanetics has been around for a long time.  I have tried many different DVD's but this feels the best on my back. 20 min in the morning and 20 min in the evening.  This works for me.,1373932800,2,184,3.945945945945946
5562917,5,B00B846BX2,"I just discovered Callan Pinckney Callanetics, and Im so happy I did!  Callan Pinckney is ultimately soothing and the stretching is fabulous.  If you are not it shape, just do it, and you will feel better, and fast improvement will keep you going. I do Barre Beginner and NYC ballet, and squeeze this in Am or Pm or all the way through, and I always feel better for it.  My lower back, which is quite often quite sore, feels so much better after doing these exercises, as no other exercise has been able to accomplish. If this is your only exercise, it's easy to do just one or both a day, as they are only 20 min in length each.  Your body will thank you for it. !",1372550400,9,665,4.171875
5562918,5,B00B846BX2,"I used Callanetics many years ago, it still is just as satisfying.  I especially like it divided into 2 smaller segments.",1368748800,2,121,4.761904761904762

8563952,3,B00B846BX2,"One really good thing about this workout is that it features real people who don't look like bikini models. They are different ages and body types, including a guy and an older woman. The exercises, in and of themselves, would not be difficult for someone who needs to get back in shape. However, too many of them require sitting on your heels with knees doubled under, which my 66-year-old arthritic knees can't handle. No modifications are suggested, and I couldn't figure out an effective way to modify on my own. There are also several that call for a sturdy piece of furniture or a bar (not on the wall, but free-standing). I tried with a normal dining room chair, but they aren't kidding about sturdy. I almost brought it crashing down with very little effort.

I ended up donating this to the library (not worth the shipping cost  to return), and bought Callanetics Basics for Beginners, instead. This time I got smart and checked it out from the library first, to make sure it would work. Bottom line, if you have good knees and heavy furniture, this would probably be a good core and flexibility workout.",1530316800,,1113,4.673469387755102

8563955,5,B00B846BX2,"Everyone is right, I can feel the difference in my body after mere days. Yes, it is super-dated and Ms. Pinckney's speech pattern is odd (southern woman who had speech training in England), but the exercises work! She is patient and encouraging. This exercise routine is good for all ages, and is a great way to build long muscles quickly.",1520553600,,339,4.666666666666667

8563960,5,B00B846BX2,"I love Callan Pinckney's Callanetics.  This dvd has 2 sets of work outs you can use for am/pm - or if you're like me, you'll do both in one sitting.  I don't get up early enough for any workout.  It's a wonderful stress reliever for the end of day and will stretch you in places you forgot you had.  I highly recommend this.  There is nothing better out there - trust me, I've tried them all.",1507420800,2,392,4.105263157894737
