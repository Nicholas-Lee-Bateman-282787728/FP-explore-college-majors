8462672,5,B00593VS1S,"This instructional package is for the drummer who wants to add to his or her sound, but is not interested in playing jazz. Although I happen to be a jazz drummer the ideal student for this book/DVD is someone who is playing other styles of music and who is motivated to add another level of texture to their playing.

The very value is this is NOT jazz-centric. Alexandru-Zorn clearly demonstrate how to employ brushes in pop music, which can extend to I-IV-V rock some call blues, as well as country, Americana and roots music. And, of course, rock (especially some forms of alternative rock!). For that reason this package should make a lot of sense to non-jazz drummers. From personal experience I can say that every other package on the market falls far short in that respect, and is a barrier to non-jazz drummers even considering learning how to play with brushes.

Plus, since this is demonstrated by a drummer who plays match grip, most drummers will be able to visually relate to the visual demos. More importantly it dispels the belief that you need to use traditional grip when playing brushes.

If you are not a jazz drummer, but want to add to your sonic palette then this and the companion DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brush-Secret-How-to-Apply-Your-Own-Voice-to-the-Brushes/dp/3943638014/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brush Secret: How to Apply Your Own Voice to the Brushes</a>, will get you there.  If you are exploring brushes do a search on my last name and brushes as keywords and you will find extensive content covering mainly jazz. And if you are a jazz drummer this set is still valuable because the author - Florian Alexandru-Zorn - is an accomplished jazz drummer as well and has ideas that are outside the box.",1390953600,,1793,5.172413793103448
