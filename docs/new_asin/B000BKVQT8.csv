8088298,2,B000BKVQT8,very disappointed.  Too brief on sights and too much on unusual food that westerners are not used to.  Very immature in its story telling.  Names of cities were not pronounced correctly.  These young adventurers are too inexperienced in their  travels.  China seems to be still very barbaric,1485129600,,291,5.085106382978723

8088300,4,B000BKVQT8,"If you are familiar with the Globe Trekker series then this would be very nice to watch. But if you are the ""typical tourist"" then this video is not for you.  Like most of Globe Trekker trips this one on China is off the tourist beaten path.  In addition you may want to brush up on your general knowledge of the geography (a bit of history helps as well) of China to really follow these trips.  Otherwise, you would be bored out of your mind.",1403740800,3,443,4.188235294117647

8088302,5,B000BKVQT8,"This is an excellent travel video!  Love hosts Justine and Ethan - they are so down to earth, witty and add so much color and context to their journeys! I have bought MANY of the GlobeTrekker series - they are my favorite for getting to know the culture and see the sites before jumping on a plane to explore!",1308614400,5,309,4.237288135593221
8088303,5,B000BKVQT8,I am planning a trip to China and have been trying to learn more about the people and the culture of China and found this to be an excellent source!!  The discs contain 3 different episodes dealing with different regions of China.  The first 2 were excellent and they interact with the locals and try local foods.  They go beyond the big cities and into the heart of China and parts of the country most people will never see.  I was a little disappointed with the third episode but all in all found it well worth watching if you are interested in China and Chinese culture today.,1194480000,21,579,4.383177570093458
8088304,4,B000BKVQT8,"I rented this movie from Netflix, and only half of it worked.  The southwest China half was fine, but the central China half froze my computer.  I'm sure you will get a fully working dvd from Amazon, one that was not already viewed by dozens of people.

This is the second dvd I've seen starring Justine Shapiro.  The first one was a visit to England, and I found that one ordinary and not particularly interesting.  This is a different story.  This is really an excellent show.  Southwest China is much more interesting to learn about than England.

If you think Tennessee is country, you need to see southwest China.  It makes Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas look like Las Vegas or Manhattan by comparison.

Justine mixes with the regular people.  She rides on their sleeper trains and buses, and on horses and bikes.  She eats their food, which includes dogs, snakes and frogs.  She takes us to their markets.

After seeing this video, there's one thing I didn't get from the England video.  I really like Justine Shapiro.  She has guts, she's independent, she's sweet, she's pretty.

She also takes us to big cities in China, and they are very interesting to see.

I found one part of the film disturbing.  She has some health problems and goes to a medical center.  She gets acupuncture.  We see the doctor shove needles into her skin.  We hear her say that she doesn't know why she's doing this.  We do not hear her say that it did a bit of good, and I think she would have said that if it was worth anything.

I tried acupuncture myself, and it made me sweat a stream, and nearly pass out.  It is powerful, and I suspect that the doctor put way too many needles into me, and that I'm ultra sensitive to it.  When he saw me passing out, he whisked almost all the needles out of me with one sweep of his hand, and I had to lay down on my back for a half hour before I could drive home.  Then he asked me to make an appointment for a second visit.  That was one of the funniest suggestions I ever heard.",1144281600,20,2007,4.351351351351352
