4066369,5,B00346UX3Q,"I saw this film in Wichita, Kansas during the Tallgrass Film Festival. Sitting between my boyfriend and my best friend, I was brought to tears and had a horrible time trying to stop sobbing long enough to give applause after the ending and even hug one of the producers who was there in the theater.

I spent all but my senior year of highschool attending private, Christian schools and ultra-conservative churches. I was told for the first 17 years of my life that what I WAS was a choice - a sinful, hellbound choice. I of course knew that those words were lies, but at the most vulnerable time of my life, being constantly bullied by adults, teachers, and preachers had a profoundly harmful impact on my life. Thankfully I had just enough positive things in my life to keep me going, and I'm now a strong, proud man that looks back on my past with confusion. How could so many people who allegedly dedicated their lives to being GOOD, be so terribly hateful? Are they just as confused as I am, albeit in an entirely different way?

This film helped answer a lot of my questions. It also reminded me that pastors are simply employees of their congregations, and that pastors will say anything that their church wants to hear. When you've got bad seeds -- hateful bigots -- in a church, that hatred can spread like wildfire, and before you know it the pastor is preaching ""sermons"" about the sins of homosexuality simply because their sheep are riled up and need some confirmation to help them sleep at night.

That doesn't mean there aren't good pastors -- watch this film and you'll meet a few excellent ones -- but it does mean that most of what happens in church is not god's word. Far from it. And if people would take the time to actually read the frakking Bible they think they're basing their lives on, they'd be in for a whole lot of surprises.

All that said, I'd strongly recommend this film to anyone. In particular, it can be a wonderful tool to show to your family if they are struggling with some of their feelings on queer sexualities. This film should be shown in Sunday school classes, in my opinion. Buy a copy or two, send your thanks to Ky Dickins and her crew, and show it to everyone you know.",1288310400,17,2217,4.466666666666667

4066372,5,B00346UX3Q,"This movie examines scriptures which are most often used to condemn homosexuality, and points out the difficulties with any ""philosophy"" of Christianity that choses to exclude people from the body of Christ due to sexual orientation.  It is serious, but not heavy-handed, and can be used as an effective education tool to help people better understand the scriptures and how they relate to Jesus' teachings of love and acceptance.",1274140800,13,430,5.231884057971015
4066373,5,B00346UX3Q,"I saw this film at the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival and left feeling that every American needs to see this film. I'd go as far as to say this is one of the most important issue-oriented documentaries of the past decade.  The brilliance in this movie is its inclusiveness.  It's not only informative and healing for the gay community but it is conciliatory and respectful to the faith community.  Because the director chose to make cartoons of the hot-button Bible verses, they are easy to understand and digest.  Because the cartoons make the film lighthearted, this very heavy topic is not oft-putting.  The filmmakers also chose an extremely credible, well-published and esteemed group of theologians and scholars to help put all the Bible verses in context.

For anyone involved in politics, For anyone involved with the youth, For anyone who knows a gay person, for anyone who knows a religious person, for anyone who has struggled with their stance on homosexuality or on faith - this is a MUST SEE movie. I think every church and temple and school in America should include this movie in their curriculum.  This movie and it's director have given our community a gift of hope, and easy education in this film.

Lastly, you will leave this movie with a sense of uplifted spirit, hope and joy. Fish out of Water was crafted with love, concern and compassion!

Enjoy and pass it along to those who need it!",1267574400,19,1418,4.778688524590164

4066383,5,B00346UX3Q,"An education in Christian doctrine on the issue of accepting LGBTQ+ people that is absolute required viewing for LGBTQ+ people from religious backgrounds. It is refreshing to see active pastors and ministers in various Christian churches explain the real meaning of a handful of texts that many Christians use to criticize and reject LGBTQ+ people. They reveal that Christianity doesn't actually reject LGBTQ+ people and they pave the way for accepting members of the LGBTQ+ community into church communities. The heart of the film relies on the idea that the ways many Christians interpret the Bible are incorrect and too many average church-goers rely on what their pastor tells them the scriptures mean or what other parishioners tell them it means in Bible study that is based on teaching Bibles that have been approved for use by their church. Unfortunately, many pastors (and many editors, translators, and compilers of teaching Bibles and modern versions of the Bible) have limited education in theology or history because they attended denominational-specific seminaries that specialize in their chosen sect's doctrine instead of a true divinity school that teaches comparative theology, the history of The Bible as a book (including who wrote the books, when they were written, who chose which books to include), the historical context in which The Bible was written, and the problems with the modern translations that simply do not deliver the messages contained in the ancient Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, or Latin writings on which The Bible is based. The pastors in the film often refer to the historical context in which the some of the chapters and verses that are used to persecute LGBTQ+ people were written to prove that, when taken in proper context, these often-cited scriptures have absolutely nothing to do with rejecting LGBTQ+ people. The film is effective in exposing ho difficult (or impossible) it is to translate some ancient terms into modern language, which means mentions of homosexuality in modern Bibles did not exist in the ancient texts. The clergy in the film also criticize the willingness of modern day Christians to pick and choose which outdated Biblical behavior restrictions to follow, noting that clinging to one passage in Leviticus to criticize LGBTQ+ people seems extreme-- especially because Leviticus was written during a time when Judaism (not Christianity) was trying to establish itself as a monotheistic alternative to polytheism by creating a strict set of rules to differentiate Jews and non-Jews in the ancient world.

When LGBTQ+ my college students come to me with their fears of coming out or their horror stories of rejection by their religious families and their conservative churches, I refer them to this movie. I also refer them to two books written by the late Yale University historian, Dr. John Boswell, that demonstrate that Christianity approved of LGBTQ+ relationships until about the eighteenth century. Boswell's books are based at least in part on research done in the Vatican archives, which exposed a much more complex history of homosexuality in Christianity than many of today's Christians are prepared to acknowledge, a history that includes implications about some of the major figures in early Christian history that explain how homophobia crept into Christian doctrine and took hold.  I have had LGBTQ+ students and their families tell me how much Boswell's books and the film Fish out of Water have changed their lives by repairing rifts in their families and bringing them closer to God. Honestly, educating oneself is part of the battle against heavy-handed attempts to use religion as a weapon of discrimination against non-Christians, foreigners, the poor, and women in modern America. Fish Out of Water and John Boswell's books are key components in that battle for the LGBTQ+ community.",1437264000,4,3868,5.257281553398058

Doesn't really give a ""fair"" platform for the fundamentalist point of view, but that's not really the point-- they kind of get 98% of the platform everywhere else.  The only spokespeople for the ""Love the sinner""  (or hate the sinner in one case) are a small-town church pastor, and Fred from the Jonesboro Baptist cult.  So while it leans heavily one way, I have to say that it is a breath of fresh air to people who have only heard the fundamentalist viewpoint.

4066395,1,B00346UX3Q,The movie/ documentation is not accurate. When she spoke if sodom & gamor was in accurate. Sodom a gamor was about gods punishment for a sinful place. The other thing that is misleading is the pastors that is justifying it was the same pastors that performed the weddings.  That is biased . The next thing the use of the word homosexual was not a word during the time of the bible was written or before it was written. The bible says love your neighboor but it cannot go over everything. Too many people try to justify what they do. Becouse in the end you will half to answer to God not your mate.,1417132800,,597,4.283185840707965

4066415,5,B00346UX3Q,"I found especially enlightening that there is one word (often the most often used, written by Paul - don't get me started on him because I know things about him that most would find very upsetting,) that *no one really knows the translation to*, so they just throw in homosexuality - male, BTW.  It's one of the last ones in the new testament, but it's a compound word that could mean so many things, including pedophilia (which I would personally condemn due to the psychological damage to the child.)  There's just insufficient information available to tell what he was really referring to, as in many other places in the Bible.

Nowadays, literalists, dogmatic readings, fundamentalist word-for-word-from-God just has no place, because one must also take into account the context in which it was written.  Read the whole chapter, not the verse taken out of context, and you'll often see is also says something else than this 'selective reading' that is used by the majority of churches today.  In the Pentatuech (the first 5 books of the Bible,) read just a few chapters before there's the condemnation of _male_ homosexuality (they were trying to raise their population at the time,) and you will see verses as well that condemn wearing clothing of two different types of fiber, a ban of shellfish and shrimp (which were to be considered abhorant, so Joshua never got a lobster or crab dinner,) and references to men having harems and multiple wives, concubines, selling one's daughter, and other things that just have no place in our society today.

For those who would condemn those who are sisters or brothers, as I've been told the lingo is preferred, I quote Jesus when he said, ""Let him who is without blame throw the first stone,"" and ""Make sure you've that translated right, and in context.""",1369180800,,1803,4.856677524429967

The ridiculous claim of fundamentalists picking and choosing the portions of the law to obey by citing the dietary laws of the Old Testament and how Christians do not follow them was addressed by Jesus directly in Mark 7:14-23  where Jesus declared all foods clean.  The video's interpretation of the Genesis Sodom & Gomorrah passage is further rendered invalid directly by Jude 7,  where the New Testament directly states that the reason for God's judgment on the two cities was due to their ""going after strange flesh"". I could go on criticizing this trite cartoon with its fanciful exegesis of the Bible, but I feel that is a sufficient starting place anyone with an open mind seeking to investigate the topic. The first rule of hermeneutics or Bible interpretation is that the most obvious and straight forward interpretation of the passage in context is usually the correct one. The fact the producer of the video violates this principle, not just once, but for every relevant passage is the tip-off that this is someone with an agenda who lacks all objectivity.",1465776000,2,1160,5.06282722513089
