7413693,4,B014IEQAXE,"Camilla Lackberg is a wildly popular author in Sweden, the DVD informs us.  Erica Falck writes crime novels and has settled in the small town of Fjallbacka.  In doing so she sets off a crime spree which must make the per capita murder rate the envy of all Sweden.  Erica does not have special intuitive powers or inexorable logic, like the heroes of The Bridge or Beck.  She is not an ace hacker, a groundbreaking female crime reporter, or a cranky communist like in some other nordic series.  Her special powers seem to consist of a.) astounding sudden moves, like when she knocks out a suspicious person she finds with a candlestick or something b.) the ability to cycle around with a baby pram that looks like it could part a snow drift, and c.) the ability to say things which cause people to want to murder other people and sometimes her as well.  In the third episode Mellberg, the police captain, figures this out!  About time someone said it!  Erica has been indirectly involved in the deaths of at least 10 people in a few years, judging from the growth of her family over three episodes.  Does she solve the crimes?  Well, maybe.  She says at one point, when someone is amazed at her knowlege of insulin, that she learns a lot in researching her books.  Never mind that tens of thousands of people already know this, or that the things she figures out are not all that hard to figure out.  She has fun doing it!  People die!  It gives us a new insight on the violence of nordic people ... kanske (Swedish for maybe?  Maybe).  Along the way I've learned how to say goodbye in Swedish (Hey!) and good, as in How are things going? (Bra, or Bro, kanske).  I hear ""precis"" a lot for exactly.  This is definitely not on the level of The Bridge, or Beck, but it's also strangely appealing.  I have to buy another three episodes.  Hey!",1462320000,4,1837,4.440119760479042

7413695,5,B014IEQAXE,Perhaps if Camilla Lackberg had written more stories there would have been more dvds. The two dvds are really great and the husband wife team make the mysteries dissolve. You even get to know how to pronounce Fjallbacka!,1461024000,,220,4.815789473684211
7413696,4,B014IEQAXE,"My husband and I are fans of Scandanavian mysteries -- and we enjoyed this production a lot.  I wouldn't give it the same rating of 5 stars as I would award The Bridge (that is truly superb, in my opinion), but it is quite good and a compelling mystery series.  4 1/2 stars would be about right for us.  It's a bit different, as the female protagonist is a mystery writer who does quite a lot of investigations on her own.  That makes for a different angle, but it also makes for circumstances that seem implausible to me.  Her husband is a police officer; they have several small children (and no nanny) and I'm not at all sure how she finds time to churn out bestsellers, appear on tv interview shows, care for her family AND impose herself in the middle of on-going police investigations (How is this civilian involvement allowed?  Why do suspects even talk to her? Why is she taking such risks with her own safety?) These are things that troubled me as a viewer, but there are quite a lot of mysteries in print and on film that feature people who routinely take risks that no right-thinking individual would do.  I suppose we must suspend belief a bit; if you do so, you'll enjoy the creative plots; the wonderful settings, and the acting.",1454371200,15,1243,4.4734513274336285
7413697,5,B014IEQAXE,"What creative stories that keep your attention. The first story (in the first set of DVDs) is a bit grim and dark, but is not representative of the rest of the stories.

This small Swedish town on the rocky Atlantic coast is very picturesque and makes for a great backdrop. Husband is the cop on the local police force, and while he and his wife have 3 small children, the wife always has some time to help out with gathering clues from the locals or evidence.

We all enjoyed this series to the max. Would rate both sets A-1. Purchase both and you won't be sorry!",1451692800,7,564,4.311320754716981

7413699,5,B014IEQAXE,"I have only seen Episode One of ""The Fj&auml;llbacka Murders"" thus far ('Tyskungen' - 'The Hidden Child' or 'The German Child' from the original Swedish title), and I can honestly say that I am hooked, An excellent performance from Claudia Galli Concha and a darkly compelling plot make for a marvelous viewing experience.",1473552000,,322,5.09433962264151

7413705,5,B014IEQAXE,"The film did a great job in showing what Lackberg's books are like, except that in the books there are millions of twists and turns till you find
  out who done it! But it still was a great interpretation of her work!",1466294400,,217,4.142857142857143

7413707,3,B014IEQAXE,"The scenery is fantastic.  However I found the stories lacking in intensity, lacking in change of pace.  On a close reading of the description of this dvd set I realized that the stories are not based on Camilla Lackberg stories.  These dvd stories are written entirely by someone other than Camilla Lackberg.  They do share the principle characters with Lackberg's characters but that is all.  I suppose it's a little bit like watching a Miss Marple dvd that is not based on an Agatha Christy story.  It's understandable that you might find the stories a little light weight in the watching.",1463011200,6,592,4.811881188118812
8730869,5,B014IEQAXE,"My husband & I both wish there were more of this great series. All the actors are wonderful. The story lines are interesting. Plot twists are well conceived. And the endings are Real endings, with the mystery solved. We both hate the new trend of ""no ending"" endings---like when someone just recedes into the far distance & you don't find out ""who dunnit.""
These mysteries are so well done!!",1523404800,,391,4.681159420289855
8730870,4,B014IEQAXE,Relatively slow but compelling pace.  Worth it at the end,1504569600,,57,4.7
8730871,2,B014IEQAXE,"I watched two of these and decided to sell it to a used video store.  I have the following to say about those two movies:

The Hidden Child
Firstly, there are way to many flashbacks.  It seems like half of the story is told in flashbacks.  The actual story was way too convoluted.  It required a ridiculous suspension of disbelief.  In this story, I could sympathize with Erica and all of the losses she suffered.  However this is just as sloppy as the next episode.

The Eye of the Beholder
This was just plain silly.  It meandered around for the first hour with a woman having Insulin poisoning.  At this point Erica becomes convinced that it was attempted murder, with very little to go on.  These gaps in logical thought somehow carry the story forward. The fact that she is right, does not absolve the writer of having Erica seem like some kind of unhinged conspiracy nut. It takes forever to events to turn to the fact that Erica's sister was wrongly accused of stealing a painting, at which point the resolution of the murders took on some urgency.  However, just because Erica is married to the local cop does not mean that she should get away with stealing evidence and interfering in the course of an investigation.  She should have been brought up before a judge and been made to explain her actions.  Instead the murderer is caught, she puts her grown up sister to bed and has a soppy hug with her husband, just to give everything a pat ending.

After watching Broen (The Bridge), Beck, Forbrydelsen (The Killing) and Wallander, I was sorely disapponted in this flawed pseudo Nordic Noir.",1499731200,2,1600,4.604240282685512
