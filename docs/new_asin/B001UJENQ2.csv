8344119,3,B001UJENQ2,"I've only seen one of the programs on this Blue Ray, ""Under Antarctic Ice"". It follows a group of scientists and divers, including Norbert Wu, as they travel to Antarctica to study organisms living literally under the ice. The documentary features a lot of sea stars, urchins, jellyfish, sea spiders and even the odd coral. Corals in Antarctica? Penguins, seals and killer whales are also shown.

Unfortunately, my fascination soon gave way to boredom. The program is too slow paced, there is no dramatic music in the background, and the narrator has a voice I for some reason intensely dislike. But sure, this is a bit subjective. If you are an inveterate lover of all things invertebrate, or obsessed with a continent which truly is the final frontier, you might find this at least somewhat interesting. For that reason, I give ""Under Antarctic Ice"" three stars (or perhaps two-and-a-half).",1375056000,,892,4.9865771812080535
8344120,2,B001UJENQ2,The movie was pretty short and half of it was the scientists talking. It is not worth the money or the time.,1324944000,2,108,3.9545454545454546
8344121,1,B001UJENQ2,"This is a documentary of the schleps that went to Antarctica to film a wild life documentary. OK, in fairness, the wildlife photographers are probobly perfectly decent people and may even be quite capable as wild life photographers. I say this because there were some really nice shots. Only problem is this p.o.s. is not concerned with that. It is concerned with the trials and tribulations of the would be film makers. I really don't need to see extended footage of a camera man packing his bags. However, if that is what you are looking for, then look no further.

I shut the first program off after 25 minutes and at that point there was somewhere around 2 minutes of actual wild life photography. At that point I got sick of waiting to see what I paid to see and shut this thing off in disgust. Up to that point, it should be noted that there was also virtually no information about the Antarctic wild life this program was supposedly slated to document.

At the end of many BBC Natural History Unit programs there is a short making of documentary usually lasting about 10 minutes. This Nature video is like that, except they leave out the nature part and also fail to include anything that may be of interest in the filming of. Some Nature videos are very good. This is not one of them.",1310083200,,1292,4.493617021276596
8344122,2,B001UJENQ2,"Both of the programs on this blu-ray are disappointing.  The first, dealing with life under Antarctic ice, should have been called ""The making of a documentary about life under Antarctic ice.""  If the subjects of the documentary were so interesting, why is the thematic focus of this production on the process of making the documentary, with a few clips of natural scenes thrown in?  Production sloppiness is evident in several places where low-resolution footage was included.  Also, a lot of graininess in darker shots underwater.  And this was a special expedition to photograph nature in high resolution?  The merits come from the several brief clips that were very good, and a film composed of more of the good material could have been very good indeed.

The ""encountering sea monsters"" program has a terrible, hyped-up title to be sure.  This program also has a lot of clips that belong in a program called ""the making of a documentary on my adventures with cephalopods.""  This program has much more natural history, but also has a lot more low resolution (including less than DVD material) stock in it.  It is very strange to jump from a brief HD clip of a cuttlefish to a longer segment in low res on the same subject.  Also, a lot of unprocessed scan lines in this footage as it was processed for a ""HD"" product.  There should be a serious disclaimer on the packaging!  Again, the merits (two stars) result from the several clips that are in fact of high quality.

Why the lack of consistent natural history production, the focus on human participants, and the uneven technical quality?  I have no answers to this, but I'm ready, with Congress, to pull national funding from PBS as a lost cause.  Let amateur naturalists who really care what they are producing take over.",1301356800,,1780,4.786885245901639
8344123,3,B001UJENQ2,"If you are looking for something on the level of Planet Earth look elsewhere.

For those of you (like myself) who have never seen ""Nature"" before: it is shot on video rather than film. This means that it looks like you shot it with your camcorder. Also, some of the content is clearly not HD, ant it can be distracting as it switches back and forth.

As for the content, don't expect anything scary for the ""monsters"" part of the program.

I do have to admit that parts of the disc are stunning, hence the 3 stars. But over all, I would have picked a different title if I had known what I was getting.",1254787200,5,601,4.208695652173913
