205000,4,5550211793,"Last Flight Out is a sweet movie, produced by Billy Graham's Worldwide Pictures.  A young female medical missionary assists a remote South American village, as it struggles to observe Christian faith, while being coerced by Narco-terrorists to work a cocoa farm (read cocaine).  The rest of the missionaries have pulled out, but our young doctor refuses to leave.  Her wealthy, well-connected father hires her ex-boy friend, a street-wise pilot, to extract her.  As the story plays out, the passion and commitment of love plays out powerfully.  Spiritual themes are also explored in some depth.

Some minor complaints are that the action scenes are clearly low-budget.  At one point, the villagers were fleeing from the narco-terrorist gang, and I actually thought that the two groups would run into each other.  The clumsiness of these scenes is somewhat mitigated by the strong acting, that comes across as natural and seasoned.

Bottom-line:  Last Flight Out should prove particularly popular with Christian audiences.  However, the movie will please anyone interested in a romantic, family-friendly adventure movie, and who does not mind some spirituality being infused into the dialogue.",1126137600,9,1192,5.423913043478261

7802376,2,5550211793,"I was looking forward to seeing a movie with a good plot that showed a little of Columbia & didn't have any objectionable content.  The movie was nice but rather ""preachy,"" and although the plot was somewhat interesting, the main characters were not very realistic -- their backgrounds were told more than shown & some parts seemed a little over-dramatized.  While older children might be drawn in by the story & the acting, most adults probably will not.",1134950400,2,455,4.82051282051282
