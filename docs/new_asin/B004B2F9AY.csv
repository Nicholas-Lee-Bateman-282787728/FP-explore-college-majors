8421299,4,B004B2F9AY,"Following some late season success the 2010 Texas Rangers aspire for post season glory. With  addition of new players, a coach, and the return of a former player the team goes out and finishes the month of April in last place.

Eventually they gel as a team and players succeed. By the end of June they are 17 game over .500. Acquire more quality players and appear in the World Series for the first time. Much archival footage and many interviews. I watched this to see Josh Hamilton. Insightful and colorful.",1466640000,,510,4.593406593406593

8421302,5,B004B2F9AY,"As a Texas Ranger fan since their inception in 1972, 2010 was a great year for me!  This DVD is wonderful.  It shows an amazing season, topped by my beloved team winning the American League Championship, something they'd never come close to having done.  The DVD does a great job of showing the highlights of this magic season.  Any Ranger fan should add this to their library.",1299196800,7,377,4.582089552238806
8421303,4,B004B2F9AY,"The Texas Rangers' 2010 baseball season was so full of highlights and unexpected outcomes, that to really do justice to the season, this would have to be a multi-DVD set.  The disc covers the team from spring training through the playoffs and the unexpected appearance in the World Series.  My only real complaint with the disc is that not enough time was spent on covering the ALDS, ALCS, and World Series.  There were so many twists and turns in the series with Tampa which are barely mentioned on the dvd, and the domination over the Yankees in the ALCS should have been the high point of the dvd.  The coverage of the World Series is even worse, with the first two games in San Fran hardly being mentioned.

In spite of these comments, I still recommend the dvd to all Texas Rangers fans.  We waited a long time to see the team have this success, and watching ""It's Time"" is still a nice way to relive the 2010 season, and get ready for 2011.",1295827200,7,946,4.408045977011494
