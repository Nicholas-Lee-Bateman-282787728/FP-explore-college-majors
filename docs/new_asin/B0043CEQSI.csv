8414587,2,B0043CEQSI,"Master Czech director Milos Forman's American debut is a major disappointment.  Forman's later work offered real insight into the American psyche but this one shoots blanks.  Allegedly about the counterculture and generation gap circa 1971 this flick is narratively incoherent and really offers nothing to say.  Ostensibly about a teen runaway (Linnea Heacock) and the effect on her uptight parents (Buck Henry, Lynn Carlin) the characters fail to register.  They're poorly etched out and rarely rise above the level of caricature.  I counted two scenes that offer something.  One involves an affecting folk guitar performance by a young Kathy Bates here billed as Bobo Bates.  The other involves a seminar conducted by Vincent Schiavelli  on how to smoke a joint to a room full of parents of runaway children.  Two scenes do not make a film, however.  Also this French Blu-ray import has a prohibitive price tag that will give you pause.",1527120000,,938,5.1118421052631575
8414588,4,B0043CEQSI,"Certainly of its time (late 60s). About a couple who worry about their teenage daughter running away from home. Several hilarious bits. For example, the bit where people are trying out for a part in what appears to be an off off broadway production. Some of the try outs are really funny. But, one of them is a young Carly Simon, pre-Your So Vain, playing it rather straight. The scene at the parents meeting, where they are taught about marijuana, and the strip poker scene are also great. Buck Henry is marvelous--just prior to his stint doing Samurai Delicatessen skits with John Belushi on SNL. I was really glad to see this again. In English with French subtitles. I just ignored the subtitles. Rare",1484784000,2,704,4.685483870967742
8414589,3,B0043CEQSI,"This film and I have a history. I first saw it in 1970's London, while I was living there after College, and I almost fell out of my seat at some of the humor. I'll admit it hasn't stood up quite as well as it might, but I still enjoy the film and it's take on the ""the way we were"" in the very early 70's. Pity none of the extras play, otherwise I'd add a star.",1438992000,2,362,3.7142857142857144
8414590,5,B0043CEQSI,"Don't buy this for the extras unless you have a TV that converts 1080/50i to 1080/60i...they will not play on your Blu-Ray player, though the menu and movie will. That was a bummer, because I already had a high-def copy of the movie itself.",1431820800,4,240,4.4772727272727275

8414594,5,B0043CEQSI,"Taking Off is a 1971 film comedy. It was Czech director Milos Forman's first American film,after he left at the time of the Prague Spring. It tells the story of a group of parents whose children have run away from home. The parents take the opportunity to rediscover their youth. The title is about parents' attempts to keep up with their children,to reform themselves,to discover what they can do to find their kids. In doing this they copy their children to avoid becoming the authority figures who have driven them away. Buck Henry,the well known comedy actor plays a father. Written by Forman and John Guare,Taking Off summarizes bemused 1st impressions.

It features a number of memorable set pieces, including an open-mic record label audition which is woven throughout the film, featuring a number of female singers (including a young Carly Simon and a haunting acoustic ballad by a then-unknown Kathy Bates) performing old standards, folk ballads, and rock songs; a meeting in which a group of generally middle-class conservative parents are taught how to smoke marijuana; and a raucuous but sweet game of strip poker played by the adults. This is probably Forman's freshest and best film. We see the film from the parents' perspective. The attempts to bridge the generation gap takes the parents through a series of misunderstandings and failed intentions before they realize that they, like their daughter are equally confused. Age confers complexity. Forman went on to do One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. This was his calling card.",1312416000,11,1554,5.0703125
8414595,5,B0043CEQSI,This off-beat comedy was Milos Foreman's first American film and one of his most inventive and least pretentious films.  It's a pity that it has been forgotten.  It deserves much better.,1286409600,14,186,4.967741935483871
