2290785,5,B0009HLCEW,Howie was always a delightfully funny man when I used to tune in to his TV show many years ago when he had a full head of brown curly hair.  To bad he chooses not to be funny on current times!,1387065600,,192,3.682926829268293
2290786,5,B0009HLCEW,"The tape was good.  As usual, Howie was entertaining.  Always glad to see Howie.  Have to provide 6 more words.",1360972800,,111,4.45
2290787,4,B0009HLCEW,I ordered this thinking it was a different one I was looking for. Unfortunatley it wasn't but I still enjoyed it,1250467200,,112,4.380952380952381
2290788,1,B0009HLCEW,"I love Howie! I think he's halarious and enjoyable. I ordered this movie hoping to have some great laughs and found myself thinking ""this movie is stupid"" I was very disappointed. I was bored and unhappy with the retarded preformace that was given. If you love Howie, don't get this movie...it really will disappoint you.",1215043200,,321,4.8545454545454545
2290789,3,B0009HLCEW,"The quality of the product was just fine.  I'd never seen Howie Mandel on stage before, only heard him on cd (and seen him on St. Elsewhere.)  There's nothing inherently wrong with the video but I think he was still up and coming and hadn't quite perfected his act yet.  Although some of the comedy was the same as in his ""Fits Like a Glove"" album, it came across a little ""forced"".  The price was satisfactory for the product.  If you're a big Howie Mandel fan, it's not a bad item to have in your library.",1194652800,3,507,4.239583333333333
2290790,2,B0009HLCEW,"The beginning is kinda funny, but then you soon realize that this was very early material. Not to mention a very ""green"" Howie Mandell. The only reason I bought it was to get free shipping, which was about the same cost as the DVD. So no loss for me, but it might be for someone else.",1183766400,,284,4.089285714285714
2290791,5,B0009HLCEW,"I THINK HOWIE MANDELL IS ONE OF THE BEST COMEDIANS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I WISH HE WOULD PUT OUT MORE VIDEO'S OF HIS NEWEST SHOWS. THIS VIDEO IS THE ORIGINAL HOWIE, IF ANYBODY SEE'S HIM NOW, THEY SHOULD DEFINITELY SEE THIS VIDEO TO SEE WHAT MADE HIM SO GREAT. I EVEN WENT DOWN TO ATLANTIC CITY TO SEE HIM LIVE, HE'S GREAT. THIS ORIGINAL VIDEO IS #1 IN MY BOOK.",1142985600,6,356,4.028169014084507
2290792,1,B0009HLCEW,"If you saw the commercial show Howie had on TV a few years ago and liked it, you will likely be very disappointed in this DVD. He was evidently censored heavily because this performace is very disappointing and full of vulgar refrences and language. Don't waste your money or time.",1132444800,4,281,4.64
8060819,1,B0009HLCEW,It seems like he is exploiting the mentally ill by acting like a person who is mentally ill. There are plenty of comedians who actually have disabilities who are quite successful. Apparently Howie needed an edge to get ahead early in his career. I'm glad he has moved on from this act.,1524528000,,285,4.5
8060820,1,B0009HLCEW,He gets one star for working while on drugs,1516924800,,43,3.888888888888889
8060821,1,B0009HLCEW,"This is so very annoying.  He is over-the-top and not even funny.  Everything is so forced.  I like this guy, but - wow - this is truly stupid.",1510099200,,143,4.035714285714286
8060822,1,B0009HLCEW,Terrible,1503360000,,8,8.0
8060823,1,B0009HLCEW,What the hell is this? People thought this was comedy?,1498694400,,54,4.5
8060824,4,B0009HLCEW,"Pretty funny Howie and kept it pretty clean for most of the show, but toward the end not so much.",1497398400,,97,3.9
8060825,5,B0009HLCEW,loved it. Fun to see our old style of dress too.,1491436800,,48,3.4545454545454546
8060826,4,B0009HLCEW,good but a little crude.,1485820800,,24,4.0
8060827,2,B0009HLCEW,boring,1481241600,,6,6.0
8060828,1,B0009HLCEW,"I only give it one star because you MUST give at least one star to write a review.  This was HUGELY insulting!  I was only able to watch 10 minutes or so.  He is acting like someone with a disability and it was very discriminatory.  I've seen Howie on America's Got Talent, and he seems like a normal human being, but this video says something else.",1479513600,,349,4.242424242424242
