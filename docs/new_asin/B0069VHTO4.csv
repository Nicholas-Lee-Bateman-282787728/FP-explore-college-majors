Twenty minutes of Waves helps refresh me, lower my blood pressure, help center all of us,kids included.  It encourages family dialog and spending time together being reflective and enjoying each other while enjoying the beautiful DVD that is Waves.  Thank you!!",1328486400,6,362,4.901639344262295
4981020,5,B0069VHTO4,"I get homesick for Florida, and this DVD works wonderfully for meditation and etc. They did a good job ...",1384041600,5,106,4.35
4981021,5,B0069VHTO4,"We use this for our sons who have a hard time falling asleep in a dark, quiet room alone. We don't want them falling asleep to prime time TV so we put this in their DVD players and they get a night light (from the TV screen), relaxing music and a soothing view.  Problem solved!!!!",1378598400,4,281,4.109090909090909
4981022,5,B0069VHTO4,"If you can't get to the beach, this DVD is flawless. I didn't try the music background as I just wanted to hear the waves. The sound is excellent and the beaches with their waves are beautiful.",1377216000,5,193,4.243243243243243
4981023,5,B0069VHTO4,"This is the 2nd video I have gotten from this director (also have the ""Hawaii Beaches 1"" HD/Blu-ray) and both are fantastic!  The HD is perfect, the sound is so life-like it is almost scary - the only thing missing is the smell of the beach & water (scented candles help there).  Love that it tells you which area of the coast you are watching, and that each area gets to be seen from morning to sunset.  I find the videos (both of them) to be essentially soothing when I need to relax, and uplifting when I need energy.  Both are wonderful reminders of the incredible beauty of the earth...",1369872000,4,591,4.345454545454546
4981024,5,B0069VHTO4,"These DVDs are the best part of going to the beach. I am aging and it takes so long to get to the beach, plus all the attendant problems. These allow me to go there instantly, and receive all the benefits of virtually being there. They actually relax me so I can rest better. This guy did an excellent job and service for those of us who long for the beach life",1369440000,8,361,4.027777777777778
4981025,5,B0069VHTO4,"The DVD, which I loved, put into my new Blu Ray and played on my new 42"" Samsung HD tv looks sadly grainy...  or pixelated. I wondered how much better the Blu Ray would be. I took the chance and was wowed. Yes... this is truly a High Def awesome Blu Ray of beaches and waves coming in...  great sound, but the picture is wonderful. Very relaxing! Glad it loops all on its own, and does not just come to an end when you have seen all the chapters.",1368144000,3,446,4.0
4981026,1,B0069VHTO4,"Buyer beware these are 1080p (HD) quality DVD's.... NOT BLUE RAY!! The beach waves and background mountains all showed diagonal jagged pixels on my new 60"" Samsung LCD Set.  If you're buying this for a 32"" or smaller the quality might be acceptable and the jagged resolution may be unnoticable....but if you plan to play this DVD on a true large screen TV, then save your money or keep hunting for a true Blue Ray version.  The upsetting part about this purchase is they put an HD quality DVD into one of the Blue plastic Blue-Ray style CD cases and that is just deceptive marketing! :-(

These are going back!!!",1362614400,6,612,4.545454545454546
4981027,5,B0069VHTO4,"My wife loves the beach but lives in the desert, so for Christmas I wanted to give her the gift of hi-def, surround sound beachfront experience. We popped it in our PS3 Christmas morning and, as expected, the locations and photography were superb. My wife issued many an ooh and ahh, but as the guy that bought and installed the entertainment system, I noticed a problem. The back speakers weren't working. I double checked that BluRay disk provided a surround track (which it did) but I couldn't get it to work. Since I had some free time later that day, I emailed ""customer service"" which is basically the email of the videographer that shot the project. One day later (did I mention it was Christmas?) he personally emails me back and helps me fix the issue. He even followed up! This is exactly the type of business I like to support. You can feel confident in the craftsmanship, artistry and support of this product.",1360540800,8,921,4.621951219512195
4981028,5,B0069VHTO4,"This is as close to the real beaches of Florida and I've been there 6 times and I've relaxed at Tampa, Sarasota, Fort Myers, Key West, Islamadora, Miami, and Fort Lauderdale.",1356652800,6,174,4.645161290322581

8495526,5,B0069VHTO4,"I love this!  I am a Florida ""beach person"" transplanted to North Texas.  I love Texas but miss the Florida beaches.  With this disk I can visit Florida any time I want to!  It's like staying at a condo on the beach.  Beautiful sunsets and all.  It all shows up crystal clear and sharp on my 60"" Vizio.  I can practically count the grains of sand.
