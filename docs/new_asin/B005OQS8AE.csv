8481713,5,B005OQS8AE,"This concert video from November 2010 is remarkably great - in all ways - audio, video, song selection, musical performances, venue and playful banter. It includes a wide selection of songs from Norma's older catalogue, to fill out a show of material promoting their latest CD at the time of the same title. I really love that CD, and am pleased to discover that watching the performance is even better, with some songs on the studio CD not appearing on this DVD (and vice-versa so both are recommended). One of the highlights of the night is the medley of ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime/Al Bowlly's In Heaven"", but I find the opener of the 2nd set ""Poor Wayfaring Stranger"" and show closing old sea shanty ""Shallow Brown"" to be truly sublime, as is the unexpected secret encore

The musicianship is top-notch, both playing and singing. Norma and Eliza are backed by Martin Carthy (guitar and banjo), Phil Alexander (piano and accordion), Aidan Curran (guitar and mandolin) and David Donnelly (double bass).

I bet most people reading this already know how good the traditional British folk music of Waterson/Carthy (mother and daughter) sounds, and if you're like me way across the rolling sea and unlikely to ever see them live, this is the next best thing. Even if you know their music you may not know how charming and engaging they are as performers. If you've somehow stumbled upon this without knowing their sound perhaps check their videos out on You Tube first, but know that is only a glimpse of how great this DVD is.",1444003200,,1527,4.7368421052631575
