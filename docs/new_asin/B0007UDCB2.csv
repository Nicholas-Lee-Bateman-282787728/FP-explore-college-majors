2244444,5,B0007UDCB2,"This 3-disc set includes: ""The only surviving 7 episodes... transferred from their original Kinescope elements... [and] also includes additional rare rescued footage from 5 other episodes.""  Since product placement is built into the structure of this program, ads are intact as well.  And this is a very good transfer (in terms of both image and audio).  For scholars and fans who have been looking for this classic television show, which went on the air in the mid-50s, this is a nice addition to the limited amount of golden age TV available on DVD.  The material is indeed spread across 3 discs, which seems like an excessive amount of discs for an estimated 210 program minutes (plus bonus footage); but this seems a minor point.",1125360000,9,733,4.887096774193548

2244455,3,B0007UDCB2,"Oh, maybe a few excerpts, but I didn't read any of the descriptions.  I was salivating over the opportunity to see the queens of misery that my grandmother and I used to take a break in our busy summer days of cooking and cleaning to watch, enthralled.  It wasn't the panel with the applause-o-meter for how bad your life was.  What fascinated US is beyond me--probably we could have scored at least a 3 out of 5 on the misery scale, but NEVER would have appeared on TV to trot out stories of Our Life in Hell.  So she gave grandpa a little open faced meatball and sauce sangwich with a few hundred mg. of Thorazine hidden in it before we visited her sister across town for the day.  Who didn't?  So it wasn't easy making your way with a second grade education--all her children were HS graduates.  We were agog during the show, mouths hanging open, and the house could have caught on fire and we wouldn't have known it.  So yes, it had SOME of the show's flavor, a few contestants, but too much detail about their lives, and because it was made in the early days of the show, may not have reflected what I saw in the late 1950's.  Also, now that I've have a few decades to gather some insight, the movie unfortunately is so sanitized it doesn't indicate any ways in which people on the show may have been their own undoing--which was certainly as true in our family as any other.  There are some truly despicable people on--the *** advertising jerk who can only see the caring baby nurse as an ugly horse, while he and his wife are vain, lazy, alcoholics who don't really want anything to do with their own baby.  But if you were as hypnotized as my grandma and I were by Queen for a Day, guess you'll have to settle for this.",1387756800,,1727,4.299382716049383

2244460,5,B0007UDCB2,"How fun to watch the show I remembered so fondly. We think we have a lot of commercials - holy cow! At least I was able to fast forward through them. It was shocking to see people promote smoking, too. Cigarettes were actually one of the gifts!!! UGH!!

The picture quality was very good and the dvd came packaged as stated. I'd purchase from this seller again.",1303171200,,361,4.388059701492537

2244462,3,B0007UDCB2,"This program from the late fifties and early sixties exploits hard-luck women as they tell their tales of disabled husbands, deformed children, unpaid bills, etc. The woman who tugs the most heart strings in the audience gets to become ""Queen for a day"" and is given lots of gifts. This was trash tv but fifty years later it is an historical look at the place of women in American society before anyone knew what feminism was. All of the commercials (included) make it plain that a woman's value back then was tied up with making her husband happy. The host, Jack Bailey, looks like he had a number of scotches before each show. But through all of this fog of smarmy tv, the women reveal that they were strong and dedicated to the men and children they vowed to take care of on their wedding day. Their strength - a quiet, steady, grit your teeth kind of strength - made me think that the show's producers could have made a very different kind of program if they had taken these women seriously and not as sad poor women to exploit.",1175731200,7,1032,4.436842105263158
2244463,5,B0007UDCB2,I hope the things I have read are true!  I have ordered this.  My mother was pregnant with me when she appeared on this show (and won)!  I have tried forever to find episodes of this in hopes I could find the one episode (in the early 60s) she appeared in to present to her.  She still has a watch from this show with diamonds and the photo given of her crowning signed by Jack Bailey.,1165536000,7,385,4.026315789473684
2244464,5,B0007UDCB2,"Many critics over the years regard Queen for a Day as one of the worst television shows of all time because of what they believe was the exploitation of human misery for ratings and prizes.  There is merit to that opinion.  The ""game"" went something like this:  Four (or five) women would tell host Jack Bailey what gift they would like and why.  Usually the stories would be hard-luck stories, although sometimes they weren't.  The woman who told the most miserable story, as measured by audience applause using an ""applause meter,"" won and would be crowned ""Queen for a Day"" by Bailey, and would actually sit on a throne to the tune of ""Pomp and Circumstance.""  The woman not only got what she wished, but she also received literally hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of prizes.

And actually the show was little more than one long 30-minute or 45-minute commercial, but it was profitable for ABC.  And while the show might have been shameless exploitation, people like me (who saw it as a child) loved it.

What is sad in retrospect is that like so many live programs, very little footage remains of this legendary show.  According to  the box of this DVD, just seven complete episodes survive.  While the show can be viewed today as high camp, it is also an interesting look at what consumer culture was like in the 1950s-1960s.

The transfer is good for these discs, and most of the surviving episodes appear to be from the early 1960s when I saw it.  I enjoyed these shows immensely, and they brought back a lot of memories.  The original commercials are also a nice touch.

Don't miss a chance to see this show.",1136419200,27,1627,4.597222222222222
8051812,4,B0007UDCB2,"i ignored other reviews that this eas not episodes of the tv series but a movie about 3 contestants and found they were right.  Not a bad trio of dramas with good actors, features Darren McGavin, Lenoard Nimoy. Adam Williams and Dan Tobin along with a few other familar names and faces.  Doesnt quite rank a five but still pretty good.

  What I watched here was a treat in ""movie"" form.  These 3 stories were not the miserable, hard luck tales someone wrote about. Each one of the stories was special and had meaning.  The last was my favorite and had a very good lesson to teach.  It would be great if this one could be shown in our schools...about making fun of other people.
  I agreed with the one who wrote about a clear showing of what the culture, dress, mannerisms etc of the 50's was.
 Look for Mr. Spock as a chef, think it's the 2nd story,  This was what, at least 13 yrs. before Star Trek?  Hope you enjoy it.",1441238400,2,690,4.074626865671642
