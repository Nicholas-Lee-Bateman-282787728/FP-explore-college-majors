1919239,2,B0000CGNEG,"There is plenty of tantalizing hyperbole plastered on the packaging of this DVD...""Akira Kurosawa's final story!"" ""Director hand-picked by Kurosawa's son!"" But something becomes glaringly apparent 15-20 minutes in: Without the Master himself directing, you do NOT have a product that can be called a ""Kurosawa film"" (any more than the wretched ""A-I"" was truly a ""Stanley Kubrick Film"".) Yes, the story takes place in fuedal Japan, and there is a principal character who is a Samurai. But that fact alone does not a ""Kurosawa"" film make. There is a poetic sense of humanism that defined all of Kurosawa's films, whether the story was set in the 15th century or in the 20th, and that is sadly missing from ""The Sea Is Watching"" . Kurosawa would take his time to build a story, sometimes using long takes and protracted periods of silence, but was so ""at one"" with filmic language that he kept you riveted to story and character without having to glance at your watch. ""The Sea Is Watching"" has long takes, but here they are static and lifeless, with little attention to lighting or cinematography; you end up with the feel of a TV soap. The first three quarters of the film takes place in two rooms, and by the time the rather pedestrian ""big storm"" sequence arrives, you don't really care what becomes of the characters because you've been waiting so interminably for SOMETHING to happen. Some lovely imagery toward the end of the film arrives too little, too late to save it. Diehard Kurosawa ""completists"" may want to screen at least once to satisfy curiosity, anyone else view at your own risk.",1079308800,7,1596,4.786231884057971
1919240,4,B0000CGNEG,"I am not a vetran to subbed films, I however, found this film particularly refreshing compared to some of the trash they insist to put in american movies. The script (from what i could tell according the the subtitles) was intelligent and meaningful. Along with the two refreshing love stories, i found the scenes of the ocean and fields very picturesque.
The Romance element was sweet. This film very accuratly depicted the risks one takes in the development of a relationship. The story with the young samurai was tragic, and in many ways realistic. For in the end, the castes, and misinterperated intentions, occur in many ways. The case of the misfortunate man, was equally moving and logical. But beyond this, was the devotion the girls in the teahouse had for each other.
I found some of the scenes (like the milky way scene) too unbelieveable,but only suceeeded to make it more charming. So i deducted the star for lagging on abit where it could have cut some useless scenes. (but who am i to critcize, i cant even spell)",1077321600,6,1028,4.716666666666667
1919241,1,B0000CGNEG,"bad directing, bad cinematography, lighting is so off and artificial in so many places, bad editing, bad cuts, bad translation in many places so unpoetically done. cheesy suggestions of the sea leading towards the end. screenplay had the makings of what Kurosawa said was going to be his best film. if he had done this, it would have been a million times better",1073174400,3,361,4.746031746031746
1919242,5,B0000CGNEG,"This is the story of a year in the life of a small house of prostitution in Edo's ""Floating World"" (entertainment district), particularly of the manager Miss (second in command, who takes over when the owner ""Missus"" dies), and of one of the 'girls' O-Shin who, as one character comments, ""has a good heart; she just shouldn't keep giving it away.""
The film begins with the bright side of the district and their life, its gaiety, camaraderie and even tranquility.  The setting and story are so delightful and cheerful that after a few minutes I was inspired to pause the DVD and go fix a cup of steaming ko-kei cha and a plate of tea biscuits.  A young samurai, fleeing the law after a fight, begs to stay the night.  They hide him, disguising him as a commoner customer of O-Shin's.  After a chaste night, he leaves with gratitude and we can see on her face that she is taken with him.  Miss cautions her against falling in love, and when he comes to see her O-Shin sends him away, saying never return, believing he is forever beyond reach.  He is in exile from his father's house, and must go in disguise, yet he keeps returning as the seasons turn, being turned away.  One day, though, O-Shin runs after him, meeting on a wintry bridge.  The others debate her wisdom, but becoming convinced of his devotion, and particularly when in the spring he earnestly explains she can lose her 'fallen woman' status by remaining 'pure' for some time, they offer to take on her customers yet share the proceeds.  Everyone expects something to come of this, and they are involved and hopeful, seeing hope for themselvers if only by proxy.  Some reluctantly, some eagerly, they come to believe the fairy tale will really happen.
Needless to say it does not work out (that shouldn't be a spoiler .. what do you expect when it's all so happy a half hour into the film?), and the resolution of this first story is devastating to all.
O-Shin's very first customer after returning to work is a commoner Ryosuke who seems deeply troubled, and in the morning she wakes to find him crying and despondent.  He flees precipitately, but returns in the evening, and tells her a sad tale of a hard life.  Once again, O-Shin falls in love, and this time her compatriots are skeptical, but their relationship continues and grows.
The film ends with a giant storm, and floods both from the river and the sea.  Much is washed clean (this is where the title comes from, the sea is watching over their troubles, and comes in to cover them over) and much comes clean amid the drama.  I won't spoil the resolution, but suffice it to say that, as Miss says, O-Shin has ""found a good one this time.""
I have shorted the story of Miss, with her older gentlemanly lover and bad-boy Yakuza boyfriend, and her tales of being a fallen samurai with a child in a distant village, but she is almost equally important to the film though not so front and center as O-Shin, and becomes intimatly involved in the final resolution.
I at first was inclined to take away a ""*"" for some lapses in realism, particularly during the storm and flood (as portrayed it just didn't seem that deadly, particularly at the end), but when viewed as something between a filmed stage production and the realism (or hyper-realism) of a dramatic Hollywood production, as akin to the remarkable ""Kwaidan"", this objection vanishes.  My remaining quibble is ... haven't these people ever heard of a bailing can?",1073088000,8,3442,4.610474631751227
1919243,4,B0000CGNEG,"I checked this DVD out more for my wife than myself. Sice reading ""Memoirs of a Geisha,"" she's had a fascination with geishas and Japan. I've always been fascinated by Japan, although I must admit I am not a big Japanese film buff.
In fact, I've only seen one previous Akira Kurosawa film, ""The Seven Samurai."" ""The Sea is Watching"" is not actually by Kurosawa, although he wrote the screenplay and did story boards for the film before his death. The director, Kei Kumai, who completed the project, was hand picked by Kurosawa's son. Since I'm not a Kurosawa expert, I can't really comment on how true Kumai is to Kurosawa's spirit.
However, I can say that the film is excellent, a very involving tale focusing on O-Shin, a geisha seeking true love who has a bad habit of thinking she is in love only to learn her suitors feel differently. O-Shin is emotionally shattered when a samurai, who she believes loves her, indicates he is going to marry someone else.
But, she then meets a commoner, Ryosuke, whom she falls in love with. Ryosuke, however, is a troubled man and prospects with him do not look promising as he is apparently bent on taking vengence on someone (literally anyone) for past wrongs he has endured. The film climaxes when a storm strikes and the village O-Shin lives in is flooded and destroyed.
Although at times somewhat a little too detailed and draggy, this is a fascinating look at life in a small 19th century village and a lifestyle (that of the geisha) that has largely faded away in modern times.",1073001600,2,1524,4.627306273062731
1919244,4,B0000CGNEG,"The Sea is Watching may never have been filmed by its author, the
late great master of Japanese Cinema Akira Kurosawa, but it fits very, VERY, nicely in a collection of his other films. Kurosawa's films mostly featured men and their world, particularly his early muscular films like Seven Samurai. I think he wrote this film after reflecting on this point. So seldom does the focus of the galaxy of samurai films remain on the jilted-lover, the poor woman left behind. Not only does this film do that, it focuses on the dregs of society - prostitutes. Yet the world of the prositiutes is not stark. It is rich and colorful. Here it is nice to see state-of-the-art production values brought to a Kurosawa story: we can watch one of his stories in crisp color. The basic story line is a theme universal in Kurosawa's films: the struggle for human dignity in an unforgiving world. Nature is also personified and plays a role in the drama - a recurring theme throughout Kurosawa's work.
The movie centers around a young geisha named O-Shin who seems destined for a higher life but is constantly ground into the dirt. Just as she thinks the worst has come, nature plays its part. The sea that watches the prostitures ""water trade"" and fleeting lives, fittingly has the last say. Director Kei Kumai may not possess Kurosawa's cinematic flair nor feverish genius.
But he does turn in a handsome film worthy to be included in Kurosawa's legacy.",1069804800,19,1436,4.725099601593626
1919245,3,B0000CGNEG,"the cinematography is poetically great, but the storyline is a little bit contrite and boring that would need constantly revival of your mental condition to avoid falling into the zzzland. a movie you'd better start watching either you are not too tired or too sleepy, otherwise, you might not comprehend what's going on. the colors of the settings are so beautiful, but without a strong storyline, it's no better than watching pbs programs.  ""The Sea Is Watching most likely wouldn't have made it to New York if not for the Kurosawa connection. That link is also the main reason to see it."" well said by a critic. also, like some other critics said: this movie is 'an undistinguished affair' and 'more a framed tribute than an involving experience'. both are quite true .",1148256000,3,772,4.804511278195489
1919246,4,B0000CGNEG,"What a beautiful picture and a moving story! I haven't seen the recent American adaptation of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", and I would certainly choose not to see it after seeing this one. I would be too disappointed.  The fact that the ""Sea is Watching"" was directed by a native of Japan gives the story a lot more interest and credibility.

It gives somewhat a comic insight into a brothel by the Nippon  sea at the beginning of the 19th century. Life in such an  environment can be cruel and people quite ruthless. Yet, the movie doesn't focus on that: it is instead very compassionate towards the prostitutes, elegant figures imprisonned in  brightful kimonos and their rich clients, who are seen here as either fallen angels (the Geisha) or fallen heros (the Samourai). The movie has many extremely funny scenes and dialogues except - of course, towards the end.

As with all Japanese poetry, it is a total delight. Human Life, after all, resembles that of a brothel: a constant struggle, an escape from reality, an imperfect world of games and lies, and an unsuccessful search for love and happiness. And yet, there is hope. Here, the deliverance comes in the form of a typhon. The angry sea finally soars with winds blowing, flooding the streets and sweeping away the brothel's woodhouses, taking away its sins and freeing the Geishas.

Does freedom only comes with death after all?",1146787200,5,1383,4.785714285714286
1919247,4,B0000CGNEG,"'Umi wa miteita' ('The Sea is Watching') was Akira Kurasawa's swansong to film: his adaptation of his favored novelist Shugoro Yamamoto's story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career.  Director Kei Kumai pays homage to both Kurosawa and Yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image.

Set in 19th century Japan, the story explores the lives of the women of a Geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men. The house is run by an older couple who  are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers. Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha.  Oshin (Nagiko Tono) supports her family who live in a neighboring village, Kikuno (Misa Shimizu) has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste.  Oshin befriends an endangered samurai, falls in love with the gentle fellow, only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with Oshin to marry his promised betrothed. Oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically/monetarily by Kikuno and the other geishas.

A handsome samurai Ryosuke (Masatoshi Nagase) enters Oshin's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her.  Kikuno is beset by problems, deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her, and coping with a rich but abusive customer.  All the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street,  Oshin and Kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by Ryosuke.  The manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice, love, and devotion.  The sea is watching and will find protection for true love.

The photography by Kazuo Okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful: night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent.  The acting is a bit strained for Edo art, but the characters are well created and keep the story credible.  The one distraction which is definitely NOT something Kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real Japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track.  But in the end there is enough of Kurosawa's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema.

1919248,4,B0000CGNEG,"I feel relief when I watch movies in my first language. As usual I find some inaccurate translation, but they were minor. The story telling is not bad at all. It's a little cheesy, but that's the way it is in many Japanese dramas.

I really enjoyed the beautiful costumes the girls were wearing. Those Kimonos are pretty! I was also impressed with the scene of storm and flood.",1127952000,2,377,4.463768115942029
1919249,4,B0000CGNEG,"""The Sea Is Watching"" was written by legendary director Akira Kurosawa.  After his death, his screenplay was directed by Kei Kumai who has been working since the 1960s in film.  The cinematography is magical.  The little red light district community is charmingly filmed, set off from the rest of the world by a bridge, with the Japanese lanterns and the traditional furnishings creating a lovely set.  As the storm rages and the house floods, the set transforms into an eerie gothic disaster, only to end with the glorious milky way as the backdrop to the very final act.

In what is her first film (as far as I can tell), Nagiko Tohno plays O-shin, a beautiful romantic fallen on hard times.  Like a Japanese Meryl Streep, she sheds tears at the drop of a hat.  Her incredible emotional range at going from elation and devotion to despair and grief is breathtaking.  Fusanosuke is a young samurai who has killed or wounded another and is fleeing the police.  Hidetaka Yoshioka who has acted in at least 15 films since 1971 including Kurosawa's ""Rhapsody in August"" plays the young warrior that O-Shin disguises & protects.  He seems to fall in love with her, even getting her to give up prostitution for a time that leads her to believe he would break the caste barriers and marry her.  When he comes back and thoughtlessly announces his engagement to another, it breaks her heart.  Ryosuke is another customer for who O-Shin falls.  He has had hard luck, being an orphan, and veers from anger to depression.  He is played by Masatoshi Yoshioka who was in ""Suicide Club"" & played Dark Horse with a blond wig in ""Pistol Opera.""  Eventually, he serves as the story's hero, slaying an enemy and saving the day.  Misa Shimizu plays Miss Kikuno, a worker in the brothel who assumes command.  She has invented a great history for herself as being from a samurai family and urges O-Shin on, eventually at great sacrifice to herself.  Shimizu starred in 1997's ""The Eel"" and 2001's ""Warm Water Under a Red Bridge.""  The actors do a great job as the director tries to bring Kurosawa's vision to fruition.  The actors rivet us to screen and the cinematography provides stunning eye candy.  Enjoy!",1125273600,3,2188,4.720316622691293
1919250,5,B0000CGNEG,"Puppies yapping to go out early in the morning left me nothing to do as it was too late to go back to bed. So like most sleepy people I sat and watched television. Lucky for me this was on.

The scenes were breathtaking, simple but pleasing to the eye. Very colorful. Indeed, I enjoyed the color being so abundant. The sets and costumes very colorful and historicly accurate. It is an excellant period piece. Much much better than Tom Cruise's poltically correct and anti-American The Last Samurai. The characters of this film are quite human and easy to identify.

I especially enjoyed the characters, especially poor O-Shin.

Unhappy being stuck in her 'profession.' Pretty but ill equipped for so mercenary a trade. To say she gives her heart is innacurate. Inaccurate because one does not pick in love. The heart is not given but falls from one's soul into another's lap.

Fortunately, the ending is happy rather than tragic.

I must admit I wish there had been a couple of scenes with europeans. I must admit I love the secenes of cultures clash when Round Eyed barbarians are first encountered. It's like aliens from Mars landing in Time Square type shock.

But overall, this was an excellant film. A good period film. A nice drama. An excellant study of human beings. Most pleasing to the eye.",1113609600,4,1300,4.704845814977974
1919251,5,B0000CGNEG,"This is a beautiful film.  Looking beyound outward form, it sees the intent of the human heart.  With the masterful backdrop of a Japanese Brothel in the Edo Period, Akira Kurosawa again reveals the genius that made him the most celebrated director in Japan. Kei Kumai preserves the spirit of Kurosawa.  This film indeed is a wonderful tribute to his life and work.  I highly recommend it.",1109376000,6,389,4.7611940298507465
1919252,5,B0000CGNEG,"My impressions are deep and almost reverential to this Grand piece of literary Movement. Most of the visuals and camera work is a departure from Kurosawa, but it is the spirit and incredible delicacy of this film that took me. It showed how the Maestros intricate notes were firmly interpreted. You follow the story line like that of a play, sitting front and center, yet feeling you are part of this unfolding beauty as the observer. I love a film that will draw me in. This film not only drew me in, it wrapped me with its parabolic interludes. I could not stay just as the observer but felt and interactive dynamic with the characters. The message to me was clear that the great director left us with...He was a feminist in the most human sense. And man must look at himself through the female...thus the title...The Sea is Watching. This was like a large mirror from Kurosawa's cinematic mind transposed to screen reflecting that feminine flavor. I was simply amazed. Watch and allow your eyes to feast.",1102204800,5,1007,4.662921348314606
1919253,4,B0000CGNEG,"This movie is quite a departure from Kurosawa's speciality in the grand epic and heroic.  Instead, this movie is intimate and about downtrodden women working as prostitutes during the Edo period.  This movie meant to be made by Kurosawa himself and much of the production notes and scripts were done but alas, he passed away.  Anyhow, in this DVD offering, there was a behind-the-scene where the Director explained his faithfulness to Kurosawa's vision of the final cut of this movie.  Whilst the behind-the-scene was brief, we did see that much research was taken to ensure that the set and costumes were relevant to the period the movie was based.  From the fates of O-Shin (young prostitute) and her Madam, their workplace, not only we witnessed the hardship that they went through, but we managed to catch a glimpses of their courage to persevere and hoping for a better future.  Those prostitutes wouldn't be who they were if not they were born to poor families.  They need to work not for themselves but for their families to sustain their livelihood.  Guys that frequented the brothels were either slimeballs or they were well-intended.  Despite that this movie was more suitable for TV, like a typical Japanese NHK drama, I enjoyed the cornucopias of colour and sound that graced the brothels when the sun went down, almost mimicking the painting of Lautrec of the Parisian's Moulin Rouge in the 19th century.  The ending was akin to the Old Testament where the big storm came to rid of bad elements in the world and thus, the believers got to start their lives afresh again.  An open-ending for some but an ending that represented hope for the future.  Highly recommended especially for traditional Japanese-philes!",1097798400,4,1724,4.927335640138408
1919254,4,B0000CGNEG,"As seen in Umi Wa Miteiru, life for prostitutes in Japanese brothels towards the end of the Tokugawa period was rough.  Women there have fallen in status or have the bad luck of being unable to support themselves any other way.  Wearing brightly-coloured kimonos and lots of makeup, they drum up business by soliciting prospective customers on the street.  And the mission statement of prostitutes is cheekily given at one point by two of them:  give the customers a good time and never get involved.  If they fall in love, you don't.  And make sure you get paid.
Falling in love-that's the trouble with O-shin.  She has a good heart, but keeps giving it away, as someone observes, and she keeps getting involved with customers.  One is a young samurai named Fusanosuke Ihara, for whom she covers up when he flees after drawing his sword and wounding a man.  Following the rules of the house, she forbids him to come to her, and even has Kikuno, one of the senior girls lie to the samurai.  However, she's in love, though disheartened by the caste difference between them.  He tells her how there's always change, and despite her body being soiled, she could be pure again if she stopped.  The other girls band together to help her achieve this life, by taking on her customers and giving her the money so she can get married and be respectable, but disappointment is ahead.
Kikuno herself has two very different customers.  One is a kindly older man who asks her to live with him.  A friend of the madam, he always visits, bringing sweets to share with the other women.  The other is a yakuza-type who sponges off her, and is pretty rough with her.  Kikuno though, prides herself on her samurai background, something that at one point arouses the envy of O-kichi, one of the other girls.  O-kichi herself takes O-shin's disappointment with Fusanosuke so personally, the other girls have to drag her away screaming, which can be heard for some time, and would be funny were it not so heartbreaking for O-shin, who easily gains the sympathy of the viewer.  But Kikuno is a very dependable young woman, even becoming acting madam when the real madam goes to the spa for her illness, willing to take responsibility and look after the other girls like they were her younger sisters.
Then there's the quiet and brooding Ryosuke, someone who has consistently drawn the short straw all his life, forced to be a child beggar protected by a dog, to learning a trade but never being paid.  Full of desperation, he has resorted to getting money that was legally his at knifepoint.  O-shin finds herself pitying this man who has been cheated and trampled on all his life.  The others think he would bring bad luck to O-shin, already burdened with getting money to look after her little sister.  Misfortune doubled would thus equal misery.
The customs and caste differences serve as a reminder that we're looking into another world.  In the case of Fusanosuke, he has to go to his relatives as a courtesy call following his father forgiving him for his indiscretion.  It serves not only as an apology but as a dedication that one is willing to do better this time around and not shame the family.  Another is the way prostitutes escort their customers to the door, thanking them, and asking them to come again, or the courteous greeting call of ""ira-shaimaseh!"" or ""please come in!"" from the assigned greeter.  And of course, how people remove their geta or sandals before entering.
The wooden steps leading down to the forbidden district seem to make it a separate world from Edo.  The festive atmosphere from a parade lightens the film at times.  And this film, written by Akira Kurosawa and directed by Kei Kumai, projects a message of hope for the downtrodden, those cheated by life, that some divine power or force is watching them.  The sea thus manifests its Shiva/Vishnu-like dichotomy at the climactic, horrifying end, destroying the old with a fury, but ushering in a new start for everyone.",1088899200,17,3988,4.7308248914616495

Finally I googled Japanese film brothel and came up with the title.  On second viewing years later I was not disappointed.  It was as I remembered colorful, beautiful production design, excellent soundtrack and touching story.  I disagree that it was a cliche.  Perhaps films about the intimate lives of prostitutes cannot be done too much. (They don't bore me:  see NUTS and KLUTE.)  Special features revealed that it is considered a 'feminist' film.

All and many more well-worn subplots have been inserted into this mundane movie.  It begins with the nonsensical choice of translated lyrical title--if anything is ""watching"" (besides disappointed viewers) it's a nearby river that is ready to flood and destroy things (again?) with the next tsunami.  It ends in a physical mess (see below) and is pretty much a melodramatic mess in between.  The script is pedestrian and attributed to Akira Kurosawa.  It's easy to see why he was never allowed to make it into a movie.  The studio-bound exterior real/virtual sets and the dressings/drawings/glass-shot-paintings thereof are well done except for the closing scenes (see below). Cinematography and sound are fine.  Film score is light weight.  Subtitles need a good grammatical scrubbing.  They are frequently too long and often appear/disappear literally in an eye blink.  However, inscriptions (like those on lanterns) are subtitled!  Direction is undistinguished and workman like.  Acting is uneven, amateurish, and far from riveting.  Actors' makeup is atrocious.  It subtracts rather than adds to the attractiveness of actresses.  Male actor wigs are patently phony looking with visible seam lines.  The story's conclusion is ridiculously contrived and as phony as the studio-bound outdoor set it takes place in.  The latter seems to suffer from a lack of an adequate budget (if the film was shot linearly, perhaps the budget ran over and cuts were made at the end?).  Shots of women perched in a rooftop (to avoid flood water) wearing ""their best"" colorful kimonos in daylight with an obviously artificial nighttime star field backdrop are far more amusing than dramatic.

We all remember Kurosawa for his works in Jidai Geki films such as ""Yojimbo"" and ""Seven Samurai"", but the acclaimed filmmaker is far more than that. Unlike his previous period film, Kurosawa portrays unlikely heroes in this screenplay; it features prostitutes as the main heroines. The film chronicles the lives of two women who work and live in a brothel (different from a geisha house) in ancient Japan during a not-so prosperous period in the 19th century.

A small inn is blooming with business. Working come and goes to be in the company of beautiful women after a days work. Peasants, businessmen, criminals, samurai and common men all come to this remote area. Kikuno (played by voluptuous Misa Shimizu) is an experienced woman who supposedly grew up in a samurai household. She uses her womanly charms and wiles to juggle her customers and her two suitors--a gentle older man and a shady one who has links to the yakuza. O-Shin (beauteous Nagiko Toho) is a very compassionate young woman who has a heart of gold. She has a habit of falling for her not-so fortunate customers while supporting her family.

Japanese screenplays aren't as well-detailed or scoped out as American ones, so while the ""Sea is Watching"" was written by Kurosawa; the screenplay is pretty much open to interpretation. It is said that Kurosawa abandoned this expensive project before his death and there isn't much of the Kurosawa signature style to be seen in the film. While some of the set designs, location are reflective of Kurosawa, the cinematography plays more like a Kenji Mizoguchi film. Kurosawa would never use a bird's eye view in the opening act (which became a stereotypical style to period films) and Kurosawa would've fleshed out the characters of O-shin and Kikuno much more. The film while good, feels more like an everyday routine in the lives of our two protagonists.

Kurosawa originally intended the film for actress Mieko Harada in mind, and it would have been awesome to see her play Kikuno. Kind of the same way that it makes me wonder as to how ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"" would have played out if Toshiro Mifune didn't fall out of Kurosawa's graces and Tatsuya Nakadai took over the lead roles; Nakadai did tremendous performances in those films, but it still makes me wonder. Harada became famous for her role as Lady Kaede in ""Ran"" and played a prostitute in ""Ame Aguru""; while Shimizu does a decent performance as Kikuno, her features reflect a fashion model and she is just too flawless to become a heartsick prostitute. Kumai's tastes are exposed in her personality. Kurosawa's own daughter, Kazuko took charge of the film's costumes.

But enough about wishful thinking as to how this film would've turned out if Kurosawa was at its helm; let's stick to the basics of the movie. Kurosawa did bring its ""Red Beard""-like historical accuracy, something I doubt Kumai could've achieved himself (not putting his talents down but it does feel like Kurosawa). The first half of the film brings the hopes and humanity of our brothel women as O-Shin becomes attracted to a young samurai. The other women are very supportive to O-Shin's potential suitor but those hopes would later be dashed as the samurai was already betrothed to another. Kikuno has a relationship with an old businessman called Zenbei (Renji Ishibashi) who is more than willing to buy out her contract from the brothel's keeper (Yumiko Yagawa) but Kikuno is also attracted to a yakuza type most probably because of his skills in bed. O-shin's life becomes more complicated when a stranger named Ryosuke (Masatoshi Nagase) comes into the mix.

One may say that Kikuno is O-shin before she became more cynical. You can see the parallels to their characters, O-shin is still a bit nave and generous while Kikuno tries to be more smart; not that Kikuno's decisions bring better luck, it's just that fate always deals them a difficult hand. Kumai does try to bring the two parallels in their characterization to bear, but it wasn't fully realized. The film more like a melodrama about the lifestyle shared by women in this type of work. Despite this misstep, the script is pretty good and the film is well-acted. Much of the film's burden falls on Nagiko Toho who played O-Shin but things begin to change when we get to the film's second half. Kikuno's character takes center stage as we learn more about her.

Shimizu and Toho do play their characters with the right tone and feel. They do act like they are `fallen women' with a very unfortunate past which ended with them working in a brothel. I was touched by Toho's performances (although some of it felt a little too melodramatic) and Shimizu had that somewhat cold feel to her character. The supporting cast isn't too bad either as Nagase (who plays Ryosuke) exhibited that edgy balance in the script. Ginji (Eiji Okuda) is Kikuno's good for nothing yakuza boyfriend who makes the `villain' in the movie and he just made me feel repulsed by his character. The movie is about a brothel, so expect some nudity and mild sex; Toho and Shimizu both did their share of the scenes, and the scenes looked somewhat erotic and enthralling.

""The Sea is Watching"" is a film about fate, love and friendship. It may have some strong similarities to Mizoguchi's ""Streets of Shame"" in 1956 but I thought it was a very good film despite some missed opportunities in fleshing out the parallels of its main protagonists and they never reached their full potential. O-shin and Kikuno felt like they were simply ""stock characters"" at times that the movie isn't really about them, and felt like it is a movie about the brothel's daily life. We can't be sure as what Kurosawa's intentions were in the writing of this script, but I am still glad that this film has been made. ""The Sea is Watching"" has many redeeming points in its execution that I would give it a recommended rating.

7999417,4,B0000CGNEG,"The acclaimed director Akira Kurosawa wrote the screenplay for this lyrical portrayal of the lives of prostitutes in 19th century Edo Japan. Too bad he died before making the movie, leaving it to be made by Kei Kumai. And it shows, for the results are somewhat milder.

The story follows the trials and tribulations of two village prostitutes who ply their trade in a brothel by the sea, O-shin and Kikuno. O-shin is the sentimental one, falling in love with her customers even though her trade itself warns against it. One particular young samurai captures her heart and with him, O-shin dares to dream of a different, more respectable life. Yet, tragedy lies ahead.

Kikuno, on the other hand, is a born cynic - she has two steady customers who are as different as night and day - the older gentleman being kind and generous, and the gangster-type being a jerk who uses Kikuno for his own gain. Yet despite her own troubles, Kikuno is steadfast and dependable, proving her mettle when she subs for her madam.

If you love period movies especially those that focus on other cultures and history, then you'll love this - one truly gains valuable insights into the Japanese culture of the period, and of how women were treated more like commodities, with little worth. Gritty, yet beautiful and powerful.",1239840000,,1303,4.782222222222222

7999419,4,B0000CGNEG,"Beautiful cinematography highlights this Tokugawa era film. ""The Sea Is Watching,"" was written by Akira Kurosawa, and directed by his son Kei Kumai. The setting for this film is at a brothel in 19th-century Japan. The film moves at a slow pace, but is still an interesting watch. The films main protagonist is a woman named O-Shin (Nagiko Tono) who works as a prostitute. She does not heed the warning from the other prostitutes to not fall in love with the customers. However, she is kind hearted, and sees good in everyone. Plus, she has a young brother to support. One night an event will occur which will set her life on a different path. She encounters a samurai who is on the run. This samurai has come to the brothel to seek refuge. His name is Fusanosuke (Hidetaka Yoshioka).

O-Shin does everything to help protect this man from those seeking him out, and does so convincingly. Moreover, she falls in love with him. The samurai makes a promise to her when he comes to see her again, and O-Shin believes that if she changes her life, then she will become the wife of a samurai. But events lead her on a different path. Is this the man who will become her husband? Or is there someone else in her future? The film introduces another character named Ryosuke (Masatashi Nagase) who feels he is a failure. [Masatashi Nagase has been in some interesting films, and many may recall him as the character Maiku Hama]. O-Shin falls in love again. Moreover, the character Ryosuke, also finds that maybe he has more worth than he believes, as O-Shin gives him a lecture, thereby raising his own sense of self-worth.

While this film does not have the usual samurai flair, as a period piece, it is very good. I found myself captivated by the cinematography of the film. It is very, very beautiful. The story itself, while slow moving, also revolves strictly around the brothel. This story does not move away from the life of this brothel, but rather introduces characters who come and go. Including actor Renji Ishibashi, who is a regular visitor to the brothel. The story is about the lives of these women, and O-Shin in particular. Life is hard for these prostitutes, and nature is about to give them an even harsher one. The title of this film is extremely apt for this film. As the viewer will discover towards the end. This is an interesting film, and I recommend it to everyone. It is a good drama, and once again, the cinematography is excellent.",1190505600,2,2449,4.614678899082569
7999420,4,B0000CGNEG,"I am by no means an expert on Japanese films or Kurosawa and Kumai. What I do enjoy, though, is a good story told ,acted and executed well; so that said,THE SEA IS WATCHING was an enjoyable experience.

What I did know,going into this film, was a good deal about the Geishas from PACIFIC OVERTURES.I was impressed with the excellent attention to detail,reverence and custom of The Geisha women. Though I enjoyed MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA (the book and the movie-though not done by Japanese),THE SEA IS WATCHING was extremely faithful in detailing the Geisha life. For that alone, this film is valuable,especially to Americans who may know so little about the brothels of Japan.

The themes are universal in this film: a woman wears her heart on her sleeve, she falls in love with someone of a higher rank which makes union impossible. This story has been done many times over in other settings; but this would be the best I have seen for Japan.

Colors in this film are extremely vivid and bright. The end set with the stars behind the women on the roof looked very fake, though.
A great contrast film would be RAISE THE RED LANTERN (Chinese).",1186876800,,1137,4.618811881188119
