8438337,5,B004QNVR86,"In the first story on this DVD titled, ""The Works: Steel"" highlights the works of Louis Mills, one of the finest Japanese sword makers outside of Japan who goes by the name Yasutomo.  He produces his own steel using charcoal he makes himself from trees on his farm.  It's a shame only 7-8 minutes of the DVD highlight the work of this talented sword smith.  He uses the same methods practiced for hundreds of years by the samurai sword smiths in Japan.  He started in 1974 and his blades are works of art.  I've been fortunate in being able to purchase two of them.  I highly encourage anyone who is interested in the ancient metallurgy form of art to purchase this DVD and to see how Mr. Mills creates a sword using the time-proven methods of the best Japanese sword smiths.  I further encourage anyone fortunate enough to locate one of the swords forged by Mr. Mills aka Yasutomo to examine it, admire it, and if very lucky, to purchase it as each one is unique and one of a kind which represents the best of the best.  He is one of a limited few who possess a natural gift to produce Japanese-style tanto, wakizashi, katana, and tachi blades that collectors from around the world have purchased.",1347321600,,1198,4.488479262672811

The host is youthful and engaging, and the pace is quick but not frenetic.  It's also just very interesting!  I'll be using it again.",1308268800,,274,4.530612244897959
