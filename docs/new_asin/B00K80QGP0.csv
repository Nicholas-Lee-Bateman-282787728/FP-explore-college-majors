8656707,3,B00K80QGP0,"Laura is 24 and still waiting for her Prince Charming. Then she runs into Sandro at a party and its all love at first sight type thing. We also have the story of Sandro's papa - Pierre played by Jean-Pierre Bacri who also wrote this. He seems to find it hard to express his feelings and is haunted by a foretelling of his death on the 14 march.

Add to the mix some experimental music, a children's play and driving lessons and you have enough happenings to make a very good story indeed. The thing is it just doesn't work. The acting is all excellent; it is beautifully shot, well directed and professionally made. But and it is a really big but, it is not funny in the least. The romance is hardly in evidence and everyone seems to have emotional issues. The drama side of things is wafer thin too with so little actually happening that I wondered at one point was I watching the film as billed.

It does try to be light hearted in places but that doesn't always go well with the on screen `action'. I checked out other reviews for this and it is a mixed response. Some people clearly like the `subtle' humour on show here but for me it just did not translate very well at all - if you are in doubt then probably best to go for the rental option",1446249600,,1247,4.2133891213389125
