8260191,4,B0015XASZS,"This review is intended for the Seth and Laura Paris DVD in which Laura takes the class through a series of mild stretches while we all lie on our backs. (In case I've gotten the DVDs confused.)

I liked this DVD. I found it relaxing and beneficial. I don't do it often enough (maybe I will tonight). I am currently undergoing treatment for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, so gentle stretches are all I'm willing to risk. (Until the doctor or physical therapist instruct otherwise.) Just to give you an idea of where I'm at, I'm 28, I've always been physically fit, took dance classes in middle and high school, etc. I'm pretty much in shape (TOS diagnosis has set me back some), and I didn't think this video was a waste of time.

My mother suffers from arthritis really badly in one knee, and she's seen me work through the exercises in this DVD. We plan to do it together sometime in the near future.",1256515200,,897,4.463414634146342
8260192,5,B0015XASZS,I normally don't write reviews but I didn't understand why the other reviewer didn't like that it was slow. When I am stiff this dvd really helps me feel looser. I love it!,1232582400,,172,4.242424242424242
8260193,1,B0015XASZS,"Very, very, very, very slow!  If you cannot move or do anything else this tape is for you, but if you can possibly find some way to get help quicker do so.  I hardly moved a muscle in 10 minutes and I'm not sure that even helped my back and shoulders.  Even my cheap back massager worked better and was lots quicker.  Maybe if you want to just lie on the floor and not move much, this tape is for you.  Oh, and I could not return this because the seller, did not state ""no returns"", but doesn't accept returns.",1231891200,,510,4.06
8260194,5,B0015XASZS,"As a mother of two and owner of a small business, I don't have as much time for the gym as I would like, but my fitness is still important for my health.  After sitting in the office all day, or in the car driving to meetings, my posture deteriorates and my neck often gets tight.  Using the Healthy Learning DVDs and following the exercise routine has significantly improved my posture and given me the support I need to feel poised and productive at work!",1215734400,4,457,4.364705882352941
8260195,5,B0015XASZS,A friend gave me this to try.  I was skeptical since i have had neck pain forever.  I was very surprized at how effective it has been in reducing my pain and relaxing my neck and shoulders.,1215734400,,189,4.081081081081081
8260196,5,B0015XASZS,I have had chronic neck pain for 10 years.  This program has givem me wonderful relief.,1215734400,,87,4.4375
8260197,5,B0015XASZS,After watching my wife do this for so long I convinced myself to join in and am very glad I did.  I have a lot of stress in my shoulders and felt better after the first time. The more I do the better I feel. The soreness in my shoulders from playing golf has diminished too.  I've tried stretching for golf but this worked a lot better.,1213660800,4,336,4.0
