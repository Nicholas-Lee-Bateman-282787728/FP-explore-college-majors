8110990,5,B000ELTEI4,Both of my boys have loved this interactive video!  Priceless,1436832000,,61,5.1
8110991,3,B000ELTEI4,"The seller never indicated that he is only selling a DVD. This I could've bought for way cheaper!!! The DVD is great, the advert is misleading though.",1407196800,,150,4.592592592592593
8110992,5,B000ELTEI4,Happy with purchase! Item came exactly as described,1405728000,,51,5.5
8110993,5,B000ELTEI4,"My son loves these videos. They are more educational then a movie or cartoon and the mucus doesn't drive me nuts. He doesn't seem to care about the doll we got with the first dvd. Oh and this o en is not that much different then the younger age video, but it is different.",1400198400,,272,4.055555555555555
8110994,5,B000ELTEI4,"This product was great. i give 5 starts because the delivery was excellent. The DVD was in perfect condition as described by the seller. My baby loves this DVD. It is his favorite! He is not into any TV shows yet, however, he loves, dances and interacts with this DVD! I will recommend it 100%",1366675200,,293,4.345454545454546
8110995,1,B000ELTEI4,"If you have a newer plasma/LCD or LED TV, this product won't work because the stuffed animal has to ""communicate"" with the TV's speaker and the speakers on the newer televisions are in the back of the TV, so it's impossible to get it to work.  I called the company and there was nothing they could do.  TOTAL waste of money.",1357776000,,324,4.295081967213115
8110996,5,B000ELTEI4,"Both of my kids absolutely LOVE this!  The animals are great even without the dvd/cd.  This was my sole 27 minutes of peace when my first child was born.  He started watching it at 4 months.  He's now 4 years old and still watches it. My daughter started watching it and still loves it at 2 years.  I have both the 3-12 month and 12-36month.  Neither kid seems to care for the 12-36month.  We always save the 3-12month for our last resort for guaranteed happiness.  We have the dog and the cow.  Both kids fight over the cow, but they love the dog too.  I would love to find the lamb.  Definitely recommended for any age.  Even my 5-7 year old niece's even liked to watch this.  Can't believe they didn't stay on the market!  How disappointing!",1315353600,,744,4.335766423357664
8110997,5,B000ELTEI4,"Purchased used version (very hard to find) of the cow.  Fortunately, the DVD I purchased separately has synched up just fine.  I had the 3-12 month version for my grandson and he loves it.  I think it actually is appropriate for over 12 months too, but it will be nice (especially for the parents) to have a switch.  I think there were a couple of things that overlapped, but mostly it was new material.  A lot of the concepts were the same - hide and seek, what is out there - but each going the next step from the previous 3-12 month version.  Great product!",1260057600,,560,4.285714285714286
