3896324,5,B002BWP3UC,"There's good reason this film has been compared to the Godfather, which is another one of my favorite films. Watching Michael morph into the head of the family is one of the most fantastic experiences ever filmed, and it's much of the same with the lead character of this movie, Malik.

It's fascinating to watch Malik's unwillingness to kill someone in the beginning of the movie, to jumping into an armored car of 4 people with nothing more than a pistol in his hand towards the end.

150 minutes seems long, but it will leave you begging for more. I would love to see a sequel as long as they could pull it off. If you enjoy great movies, and don't mind subtitles then give this a watch, I guarantee you won't regret it.",1268524800,2,723,4.388059701492537
3896325,4,B002BWP3UC,"Malik was a homeless Arab teen living on the streets of Paris when he's sent to jail for six years for assaulting a police officer. On the inside, a Corsican crime lord finds Malik's Arab heritage useful to him and forces Malik to do his ""dirty work."" And thus Malik begins to unlock his potential as a criminal mastermind. ""A Prophet"" is not as epic in scope or as rich in characters as gangster films such as ""Goodfellas"" or ""City of God,"" but it is nonetheless an entertaining look at how it took prison to turn one man into a criminal.

The soundtrack is also excellent and highly recommended. It has one of the most original covers of ""Mack the Knife"" you'll ever hear.",1268524800,13,674,4.435483870967742

3896345,5,B002BWP3UC,"One of the greatest movies cinema has to offer. Un profete tells the story of how a man in jail finds redemption through resilience and audacity. The evolution of the main character in the movie is believable but pushed to the very limit of the imagination. This movie is a great example of how telling a good story about something very specific (jail time in a French prison) becomes universal.

3896361,3,B002BWP3UC,"Interesting view of a French prison from the perspective of an Arab prisoner. He's a new guy and has to ingratiate himself to the Corsican boss -- it is a pretty standard story with the twist being that it is a French prison and he is Arab and the big boss is Corsican. But the movie is way too long for what it has to say and the plot is confusing -- he is in prison, he is out on leave. He is in prison.  He is out on leave. . It also doesn't help that the movie is mostly monochromatic and the subtitles in yellow font are often hardly readable.",1463356800,3,548,3.936936936936937

3896449,4,B002BWP3UC,"This is a difficult film, but worth your time. A young man, half Corsican/half Arab, raised in an orphanage, is sentenced to six years in a prison in the north of France (at least somewhere it snows). The prison is run by an older Corsican man (the actor is amazing) who wields considerable power both in an out of the prison. He takes our protagonist  under his wing as his proteg, not out of compassion, but because he sees him as a blank canvas who he can turn into a janitor, an errand boy  and a murderer. A powerful indictment of a prison system that puts naive young men in with older professional criminals. Guess what they become to survive? Professional criminals.

There are some wonderful moments, the protagonist turns down a free  prostitute for a chance to enjoy a beach for a few minutes in his bare feet, the audience realizing that he has probably never been on a beach in his life. And some unintentional hilarity, where we see that even in a brutal French prison they still get their baguettes delivered.

The social themes and messages are subtle. Obviously the difficulty of integrating the Arab/Muslim culture in the French/Catholic host culture is one of the themes.

At 2 1/2 hours it took me several gut-wrenching nights to watch, but totally worth it. Acting throughout is wonderful and the ending is well-earned and leaves a thread of redemption and hope. Please give Un Prophete a chance.",1438214400,3,1417,4.693548387096774

He is soon entrenched in the battle of Muslims versus Corsicans without a particular allegiance of his own other than to survive and somehow perhaps even flourish.

Loooong drawn-out lingering shots indicative of a very poor director.
Boring segments. Lack of much emotion. Random pornographic scenes.

3896566,3,B002BWP3UC,"I don't like gangster and prison movies as a genre, and the only thing that sets this movie apart from other such movies is Tahar Rahim's fantastic performance. Just discovering him made this movie definitely worth watching. Otherwise, it's not a particularly great or even interesting movie.

Unlike The Godfather, for example, this movie does not transcend its genre and become deeply rewarding far beyond a gangster movie. I loved Godfather despite its being a gangster movie, but A Prophet doesn't rise above its material.

Also (and this may seem petty, but it's my review so I can write whatever I want to), there's a really annoying song about midway through by some singer doing a Bob Dylan imitation. Another reviewer thought it WAS Dylan and praised the movie for using his song, but that person must never have heard the real thing. Maybe to French ears it sounds like Dylan, and the singer obviously is trying really hard to pull it off, but it just made me extremely angry.

It's not even a copycat singer singing a Dylan song - it's a fake Dylan singing a song he made up to sound like a Dylan song.

3896568,5,B002BWP3UC,"This is among the best movies I've ever seen. Real prisoners were used during its filming, as extras and apparently the main character had never starred in a movie before. Simply amazing. The story begins in prison and takes a guy with no ties to anyone, anything, who is simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, who ""rises up"" in the world of organized crime. The movie is not really, to me, about ""organized crime"" but rather regards relationships, and how people can aspire to move upwards in the world--good or bad, and how ""chance"" can often come into play. A lot of times, the main character simply makes choices--right or wrong--and these choices are filmed in the most natural way. My fav scene is where the main character is in the airport, going through security and he sticks out his tongue for the airport guards to see, not understanding this is not necessary outside the prison world--this scene is subtle and beautifully done, with no mention of it by the airport security. There is a mysticism about this movie, a ""flow"" that is so natural and beautiful that it doesn't even seem like you're watching a film. The story is amazingly done in a very realistic way and chronicles a guy's rise within the organized crime world, but again, it's not a Godfather-type movie (thank goodness, too, as if there weren't enough of those already). Stellar acting from ""Caesar"" the older mob boss and the main character. ""Caesar"" is left to basically rot in prison as punishment, alone. A very sad/intriguing movie that ends when it should. Very well filmed, acted, and directed. A beautiful film. I suppose the title can mean a lot of things.. to me, it simply means the character was a sort of ""prophet"" because of his choices. He saw his chances in life, and took them. The ""deer scene"" to me had little relevance, but that scene in fact saved his life possibly. Every actor in this movie was outstanding.

Although some brilliant cinematography and a masterful performance by the Danish godfather Cesar, the film is no ""masterpiece"" as some have claimed.  One needs ""cliff notes"" to follow the convoluted story.  Count how many times the lead actor takes off or puts on a shirt, or walks down still another hall.  The film may be more enjoyable if you speak French, Corsican, and Arabic, as the subtleties in many of those exchanges are lost with the sub-titles.  The ""ghost"" bit didn't work for me either.

And he is trapped in the walls of his existence by an allegiance that no force can undo. The sentence is six years; only if the punishment ever concluded.

The first clear words out of Malik are that he ""didn't"" commit the crime he is held responsible for. It is likely that even if he is responsible, it was only an act of frustration and momentary anger. He is completely unaware of the protocol of prison life, keeping himself as a virtual outsider and loner. It does not take first-hand experience in prison showers to know that the loner or silent guy will not be left to his own devices.  Not understanding the unwritten laws of the institution he is tied to, he does not near himself to the Muslims in the prison system. It is assumed that these are his people based on his name, El Djebena, and his features which separate him from the Non-Muslims. Before he has the chance to align himself, the Corsicans employ him for a task that inevitably leads to death of himself, if he fails to successfully complete his task, or of another Muslim, if the mission is accomplished. Afterwards, he is under Corsican protection, and seen as an enemy of the Muslims. He is also disliked by the Muslims for joining with the Corsicans, and from his allies for their affiliation with a Muslim.

Once integrated in the crime world, he embraces it. He eventually gets his fair share of opportunity and position to shine in prison and out by the Corsican boss, Cesar Luciani. Knowing well that Cesar is using him as a pawn in his plans and able to separate him from the living by a simple order, he begins to develop a drug business with a friend on the outside. Despite the threats, kidnapping, and physical intimidation by Cesar, he continues the business. As his prison sentence comes to a close, he also begins to earn the respect and favor of the Muslims.

All the ingredients are ready for a betrayal. With only so many limited options, the benefactors of his decisions are guessable. Our view of Malik as this innocent youth that is caught between two major prison powerhouses shifts by the later stages of the film. He turns in to a younger version of Cesar: hungry for fame, money, and power. He lacks the violent outbursts of Cesar, but we do not observe him long enough-in a position of power-to realize if he develops his former boss' unsavory traits. Director Jacques Audiard puts the audience in a difficult position to root for a man who has the potential and ambition to become a staple crime boss. The suspense is what keeps the film rolling along at an acceptable speed. We want Malik out of Cesar's hands before the prison experience shapes his life in the real world.

The performance of Niels Arestrup as Cesar is a visceral experience of exceptional power. Yet, Tahar Rahim's portrayal of Malik is something that words don't do justice. The pauses, grunts, hair movement and scratching seem so simple; however they are done in the right emotional moment and add to the layers of this character who is obliged to take part in Cesar's madhouse control of this prison system.",1326067200,,3216,4.59581881533101

The problem I found with the whole thing is how slow it moved (OK, it's a French film so that's probably unavoidable) but also how many scenes are shot in virtual darkness.

The DVD has virtually no good extras at all altough it has a slew of deleted scenes, rehearsal footage (super yawn!), screen tests, a trailer and a commentary track with the director, co-writer and lead actor.

Where I ultimately felt let down was by the lead actor. I never really took to the guy. At the beginning I felt his performance was riveting but once the cheesy moustache arc began, it sort of lost me.

I do think this is worth your viewing but its portrayal of Corsican French vs. Muslim immigrants in the prison I thought lacked bite. I get what the screenwriter was trying to say about ""modern"" France through the eyes of its prisons but I don't think it worked as well as I think a crime movie about life outside a prison would.

3896604,3,B002BWP3UC,"I think my review's title says it all about this film...it's a harrowing story about how a young guy of North African descent goes into prison a minor league criminal and eventually evolves into a big-time drug dealer and murderer.

I found a lot of it engrossing, and it certainly provides an argument against putting someone who has some decent aspects to his character in with a group of hardened criminals.  For example, the protagonist, Malik, is virtually forced into committing a murder by the Corsican gangsters who rule the roost in the prison (with the gang's leader a particularly effective and menacing character).

But over time, Malik pretty much evolves into someone you'd want to see stay in prison.  He starts dealing drugs.  He takes part in more murders.  Somehow, he sort of becomes ""redeemed"" at the end, but he's not someone I'd feel happy about living in the same neighborhood as I do.

So in the end, I find myself thinking, ""hurray, this hardened felon is out on the street, and maybe he'll go straight but maybe he'll just be drug dealer who happens to pray to Mecca five times a day.""

3896606,5,B002BWP3UC,"One of the truly great films of 2010, ""A Prophet"" is an unforgettable account of a young man's experiences in a French prison.

Malik El Djebena is only 19 when he's sentenced to six years in prison for a crime he claims he didn't commit.  Though an Arab, Malik becomes the cat's-paw for an aging Corsican mob boss named Cesar Luciani whose influence in the prison has begun to wane as more and more Muslims are brought in to swell the prisoner ranks.  Eventually, the ever-resourceful Malik finds a way to straddle the lines separating the various factions in the prison, while at the same time partnering with his buddy to run a hashish operation when he's out on his frequent 24-hour leaves.

The beauty of ""A Prophet"" is that we really get the sense that, had he been dealt a halfway decent hand in life, Malik might have actually been a kind, caring person, instead of the lost soul that he`s become.  But the lack of any parental influence in his life, his illiteracy, and now his consignment to prison life have left him with few viable options other than to become involved in mayhem and crime.  He's  horrified by the fact that, as a kind of loyalty test early on, Luciani forces him to murder in cold blood a man he doesn't know and might even like under other circumstances.  And there are heartbreaking moments throughout where we sense the goodness in Malik's tortured soul.  His appreciation of simple kindnesses, his attempts at learning to read, his childlike wonder as he looks out of a plane window for the first time, his tenderness with a buddy's newborn son - all go a long way towards mitigating some of the truly despicable acts of violence and murder he`s called upon to do.  The brilliant screenplay wisely refuses to judge Malik; it simply presents the options and parameters that have been given to him by fate, society, nature, what have you - and watches as he maneuvers through, in and around them in order to survive.

Harsh and brutal as this film can be at times - for it never shies away from portraying what life is like in a prison setting - it is in those more lyrical moments, the ones in which we are allowed to see into the heart of this young man, that ""A Prophet"" achieves true masterpiece status.

Tahar Rahim rises to the challenge in a brilliantly understated, award-worthy performance as Malik, capturing our sympathy and concern throughout.  Niels Arestrup is also outstanding as the brutal and demanding Luciani, as is Adel Bencherif as Malik's one friend from prison who serves as both a positive and a negative influence on the young man.

This is his first time an adult prison, he has no support in or out of prison and quickly falls in with the Corsicans who control what happens there. His hopes to serve his time in peace and without incident end as he learns of the division between Corsicans and Muslims.  The sadistic head of the Corsican prison Mafia is C&eacute;sar Luciani, who strong-arms  Malik into the Corsicans' activities, beginning with the murder of a Muslim inmate. In doing so Malik Solidifies his place as an outsider to both sides, the Corsicans, who still see Malik as a dirty Arab, and the Muslims who mistrust him because this cooperation, regardless of this North African blood...then things get complicated, suffice to say Malik begins a journey that eventually gains him allies, and a awareness
of his own heritage.

The film is violent, unrelenting and complex, you may want to buy a program.

Faced with the option of acquiescing or being killed himself, Malik manages to get the job done and, in turn, falls under the protection of the imprisoned Corsican capo. Complicating matters for Malik is his liminal identity.

Through a series of connections with other inmates and cohorts on the outside, Malik evolves into a powerful crime boss. When his Corsican capo arranges for a number of day passes for Malik, he carries out his boss' wishes and even manages to pull off some deals of his own.

It's subtitled, and if you watch, you should be sure to select English SDH, because knowing which language is being actually spoken and translated to subtitle is an aspect of the plot and provides nuances in the dialogue.  Spoken options are French and German, and unless you speak German, you will prefer French voice, since it is that of much of the film.

I don't know if more should be revealed than is found on the jacket, but the story is a genre of organized crime and gangs, with hints into possible terrorist-funding sources, but it is not presented in the usual way at all, particularly in how the film explores the apparition of conscience and guilt.  It is very strong on character, with Tahar Rahim giving a thoughtful and subtly expressive performance in his first motion-picture role, his portrayal, with ephemeral shades of Antonio Banderas, building slowly, along with the film's plot, to show a complete evolution of status and power in the principal characters, and undoubtedly marking for Rahim the beginning of a fruitful career.

3896614,5,B002BWP3UC,"Having seen Audiard's films before(Self-made hero,Read my lips,The beat that my heart skips),I was primed up for this state of the nation film,depicting the French underbelly of life. As before we get the dominance of father-son dynamics and the forging of masculine identity. We get the genre of social noir,anchored in social reality, the prison,the lodestone of crime,with the painstaking recreation of a prison and the use of former inmates as extras. The prison population is segregated along ethnic lines,between Muslim and Corsican,who both shun Malik,a non-religious North African Arab,and who are in a power struggle. But they are all French.

The film depicts a cruel kill-or-be-killed world,in which brute force,violence and corruption reign.

He is `born',when once he has been initiated into killing Reyeb in a scene of stark violence,he survives under the protection of Cesar (Neils Arestrup).He is rewarded by Cesar for doing what he's told(makes the coffee,cleans up) but severely punished if he puts a foot wrong,called a'dirty Arab' by the Corsicans. Malik(Tahar Rahim) seems to flower spiritually through study and cunning and as his actions become more violent and criminal as he accesses new networks and associates.

The film is a stylistic tour de force using fade out or closing down, and poetic imagery amidst the bleak interiors,a deep artistic vision,style to match the content. The ghost of Reyeb infuses the film with guilt transformed into a ministering angel figure. The overcoming of his guilt is when Reyeb is entirely in flames. Malik's criminal ascent occurs while he is still in the prison but thanks to the corrupt networks in the prison, which also allow him the occasional day release,he is able to operate successful activities in the outside world with his dying colleague Ryad as well as doing errands for Cesar. Intelligence allows Malik to rise above and liase with the competing networks. This film is not of cold realism,it shows several non-realistic touches bordering on surrealism and none of the violence is gratuitious. Malik sees animals in dream sequence where he sees a herd of deer running along a road,criss-crossing.

At a moment of great stress to his life travelling in a car, he sees animals coming, cries `watch out!'and they hit a deer. Also after an extremely violent scene where he kills people in a van his face seems to float up from the darkness with a serene smile. A mystery of unspoken images and Tahar Rahim's phenomenal face able to register so much pain,fear,hurt and yet delight. An unsettling anti-hero. Neils Arestrup gives a master class in acting as the father figure. Other cameos are great like the `Gypsy' and Buttrim Latrache. Lyrical expresionism suffuses the whole film,which is however energised and particular,pacy and dynamic, but does not sentimentalize the nature of the criminal beast Malik becomes. The ending reinforces this idea.

A film with remarkable ambition-a state of the nation film,engaging with sociological reality,a social noir. Some reviews omitted mention of the power divide in the prison between Muslims and Corsicans and how the Corsicans dominate the prison hierarchy at first. The initiation fee for survival for Malik is the necessary murder of an Arab who is testifying against the Corsicans. We side with Malik's underdog,his vulnerability. His intelligence,and multilinguism, helps him rise above the feuding and negotiate between the different ethnic groups,but not escape the violence. The dark undertow is he becomes a mafia boss. The film's use of poetic metaphor,transcendence,the ghost of the murdered man shows how the spirit manifests itself in a barbaric environment. Malik's dream of animals running suggests his greater sensitivity to the spiritual realm. He is jokingly called a 'prophet' by the crime boss. Brilliant cinema.

3896615,5,B002BWP3UC,"Jacques Audiard's riveting `Un Prophete' is a stunning piece of modern filmmaking that should be regarded as one of the best films of the past decade; a modern masterpiece if you will.  Without a single detail out of place, the film moves along brilliantly; constructing a flawlessly impassioned piece of art.

You can feel it as it breathes.

The film follows Malik El Djebena, an Arabic convict sentenced to six years in prison for assaulting a police officer.  At only nineteen, Malik is illiterate yet bilingual.  Almost immediately, he is spotted by Corsican mobster Ceser Luciani who makes him a proposition.  He is to kill a Muslim inmate set to testify against the Corsican's.  If he fails to do so he will be killed himself.  Rather clumsily, Malik does the job, which sets him up with the Corsican clan and soon Malik is building his own internal empire; mainly keeping to himself and playing each and every side he can.  Malik is still haunted by his guilt for the murder he committed, which manifests itself in visions and nightmares.  Still, Malik is a product of his environment, but as time slips by he begins to establish his own purpose, his own way.

The great thing about `Un Prophete' is that it is not `typical' in any way.  Sure, it is a prison movie to an extent.  It is a gangster movie to an extent.  It is a thriller, a drama, a spiritual journey; all to a certain extent.

When all is said and done, it is solely `Un Prophete'.

The performances captured here are all impeccably raw and effective.  Tahar Rahim embodies Malik with a doey sense of truism, understanding how to underplay emotions in order to create a realism about his situation.  He begins the film unaware of himself and his destiny, but he walks away from his experience with a fuller knowledge of who he is, and it shows as Rahim gradually builds his character.  Niels Arestrup is sensationally good as Cesar.  What could have been another generic `gangster' role becomes something deeper.  There is a subtle calm about his words and actions, even in anger, that suggested a humanity not often attributed to these types of figures in film.  I also thought that Adel Bencherif deserved some recognition for transforming a typical `sidekick' role into a real human being; a real entity within this film.

Yes, the film is brutal and aggressive, but there is a subdued nature that permeates the film.

In the end I HIGHLY recommend this film.  It is intense yet in an understated way.  Instead of throwing everything at you in an attempt to control your attention, Audiard and company have layered this film to offer us a look inside one man's journey to self awareness.  We may not always agree with his decisions, but we understand them just as well as he does.

I have a feeling this film will only get better and better the more times I view it!",1288828800,2,2842,4.64128256513026
3896641,5,B002BWP3UC,"Director Jacques Audiard's Un Prophte is without question his best work to date, a riveting account of a boy's journey to manhood; elements of prison movies, Mafia movies and drug movies, all figure in to the development of young Malik, a magnificent performance by Tahar Rahid. At over 2  hours, he's in practically every scene; his performance is focused, layered and loaded with discovery, as well as a spark of innocence that never fully leaves him.  Despite it's length, there's not a wasted moment; fascinating from beginning to end, with some great characters, none of which I found to be stereotypical.

And it deals with prison life and ranks among the best of that genre. I've not read commentaries but one interesting aspect of this movie is the knowing portrayal of shifting power dynamics in the microcosm of a French prison between an older ethnic group that ran the system and formerly subordinated inmates. Most definitely a poignant tale for French and European viewers anxious indeed over the massive numbers of immigrants that continue to not only fill their prisons but are actively working in and forever changing their societies. Times are always changing and every dog has it's day, especially those with luck, cunning and patience. Anyway, as for our Prophet, he reminded me of a young Michael Corleone.

3896643,5,B002BWP3UC,"In spite of the violence it inevitably portrays, this film manages to develop characters that are neither stereotypical nor so strange to viewers that they cannot identify with them.

3896644,5,B002BWP3UC,"In his first two films, Jacques Audiard made me want to really like him, and while the world went a bit gaga for ""De battre mon Coeur s'est Arrete"" (and I enjoyed it well enough), I felt something just missing for me.  I therefore may have approached ""Un Prophete"" with some anticipation and more than a bit of anxiety. I was wrong to; for all that was dispelled as I fell headlong into the dangerous world of one of 2010's most powerful films.  Aduiard draws us into the life of 19 year old French/Arab Malik El Djebena, a street kid, now incarcerated for the first time in an adult prison. Malik wishes nothing but to be left alone and serve his six years without incident.  He never gets that chance.  For two and a half hours, we ar mesmerized as we witness Malik's journey from innocence and subservience to the most powerful king pin in the prison.

Tahar Rahim's performance is nothing short of astonishing, making the morose and frightened Malik a character you can only route for throughout his tortured six year stint. Uneducated, but wise beyond his years, the young prisoner improves himself through education, craft, cunning allowing his restlessness to steer him in whatever direction it needs in order to survive.  As Csar Luciani, overlord of the prison, Niels Arestrup's is the perfect foil to Rahim's Malik and the scenes between Corsican master and Arab servant crackle with a nervous energy while Aduaiard keeps layering tension, mistrust, honor, privilege and loyalty into the mixture leading everything to a predictable, but wholly satisfying conclusion.

Audiard's style makes life in this prison alternately real and surreal tossing in elements of fantasy and madness which coalesce with a beautifully distrubing madness, such as Malik's repeated visitations of his first victim, a man he was forced by Luciani and his thugs in order to justify his own existence.  You cannot make a prison movie without kindness and brotherhood entering into the equation and the friendship between Malik and fellow Arab prisoner, Ryab (a terrific performance by Adel Bencherif) establish a bond that will be not only far reaching but ultimately the salvation for both men.

Racism, too is ever a present guest here and I could only watch in wonder and respect as Malik moves between the Muslims, Egyptians, Italians, Corsicans and French judging the worth of each on their own merits (or how he can best use them) rather than the prejudice the others use to define their worlds.

Dark, gritty, powerful yet full of hope, ""Un Prophete"" beats just about any U.S. studio made film this year and I hope it receives the recognition it deserves Stateside.  A truly remarkable and emotionally rewarding movie.",1283731200,2,2711,4.9362637362637365
3896645,5,B002BWP3UC,"There's a sense of authenticity that rings throughout the rise and epic struggle of this forgotten child/man.  The best movie that I've seen for years in spite of the fact that I'm not a fan of violence, gangsters, etc.",1283644800,,219,4.615384615384615
3896646,5,B002BWP3UC,"First the ending: the three cars.  From what I understand the three cars represent the three drug gangs that Malik has united: the Arabs, the Egyptians and the Corsicans.  Their ominous presence also suggests that Malik will live the life of a drug lord and die the life of a drug lord., which of course is his fate and what he deserves.  There is also the echo from Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) with Michael at the end.

Now to the idea that Malik is ""a prophet."" I can only guess that he is a prophet in the world of drug lords.  There is the possibility that director Jacques Audiard, who has written twenty-some films and directed half a dozen including two very good ones that I've seen,  Read My Lips (2001) and The Beat that My Heart Skipped (2005), meant to disparage (celebrate?) The Prophet by comparing his illiterate and up-by-his bootstraps hero Malik to Allah's Messenger--but I'll pass on that.

The real philosophic question to be answered in this most arresting film is does Malik represent what we might call ""Existential Man"" in his struggle to prevail in life after being dumped on this planet and told to sink or swim?  Certainly to the drug gangs he is heroically triumphant, and to most of the audience as well.  Malik represents a new kind of hero, a naturalistic creation who doesn't make judgments about good or bad, or question the way the world is run (or the way the prison is run), but makes the best of what life has thrown at him and learns not to be squeamish about what he has to do to prevail.  French existential novelist Albert Camus famously said that the only important philosophic question is that of suicide. Malik chooses murder over suicide, but we cannot help but identify with him since his choices were indeed just those.

Malik's character combines underprivileged raw youth with something beyond street smarts, with the kind of courage war heroes can only envy.  That is how he wows his home boys and others.  This is what they respect.  But, looking around at all the dead bodies, and especially at Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup), the once powerful war lord who bows out of the movie a beaten old man, one can see that Malik will die by today's equivalent of the sword as did the ancients who lived the life of the war lord.  Tahar Rahim, who plays Malik, would seem to have a great future as a film star.  He does an outstanding job here in a very demanding role.

What I found most arresting about this film is the way the French prison system is depicted.  Apparently corruption is rampant with the inmates in significant control of the guards and the prison officials.  Luciani runs his drug empire from within the prison.  Prisoners favored by the drug lord powers that be get special privileges and are allowed to control the other prisoners.  I understand that Audiard studied the French prison system before making this film.  The film is an indictment of that system, which makes me wonder how they feel about this sensational film in France.

Also interesting is how the various ethnic gangs in French prisons relate to one another.  Luciani's Corsicans were mostly in charge as the film begins with Malik just a low-level forced funky.  By the end of the film the Muslim gang is mostly in charge it appears.  I wonder if this reflects the reality in French prisons.

Finally, this is a brutally realistic film in which humans are seen primarily as animals.  Even Malik's love for his teacher's child can be seen as unconsciously acting out a communal role that will result in his having many reproductive tries--indeed how sweet is the mother already on him as they walk together to the bus stop and presumably to her bed.  The only law that seems to exist is that of the jungle, that of the stronger, with the laws of the state as kind of fact of nature that must be overcome or subverted, never respected.  And the values of the larger society are irrelevant, immaterial, nonexistent and mute.  This is a naturalistic film for the twenty-first century.

In fact, the norms keep changing, and our protagonist evolves along until he gets to make the rule.  It's a long and arduous journey, nothing glamorous about it, while the viewer can stop at any number of levels--the most facile of the top narrative, deeper into race relations, or indeed see the triumph of human creativity against... human adversity.  In other words, you get a glimpse of the high and the low of the human condition in a very constrained environment.

Dialog and acting are tight, the protagonists do illustrate with discreet emotions their few twists and turns, story holds very well together and the viewer is not required to suspend too much disbelief, if any.

3896648,5,B002BWP3UC,"If there is one thing I have appreciated about Jacques Audiard's work, you know you're in for a cinematic treat.  I enjoyed his 1999 film ""Venus Beauty Institute"" (V&eacute;nus beaut&eacute; institut), his 2001 film ""Read My Lips"" (Sur mes l&egrave;vres) and repeated his success with his 2005 film ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" (De battre mon coeur s'est arrt&eacute;) and in 2009, Audiard returned with ""Un proph&egrave;te"" (A Prophet) which is based on the original screenplay by Abdel Raouf Dafri and Nicolas Peufaillit and rewritten by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain.

The film would receive critical praise and would go on to receive an Academy Award nomination in 2009, a winner of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Grand Prix , won ""Best Picture of the Year"" at the London Film Festival and would join two films in the history of the C&eacute;sar Awards by being nominated for 13 awards and the third film in French cinema history to win 9 or more C&eacute;sar awards (the last two films was the 1980 film ""The Last Metro"" and the 1990 film ""Cyrano de Bergerac"").

VIDEO:

""A Prophet"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  I've commented with nearly every Sony Blu-ray release of how these last two years have been fantastic in terms of overall presentation and quality.  The picture quality for ""A Prophet"" is absolutely wonderful.  You can see the detail of the grime around the prison, the weaves of fabric on the clothing, the scratches, cuts, wrinkles and skin pigmentation in HD and a color pallet that is full of detail and depending on the scene, great use of colors to showcase the cold prison life to the vibrant outdoor (and out of prison) scenes.

There is a fine layer of grain throughout the film and blacks are nice and deep.  Overall, a magnificent presentation from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment with no signs of artifacting, edge enhancement or any other negative anomalies.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""A Prophet"" is presented in French and German 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Although the film is primarily dialogue driven and thus sound coming from the front and center channels, you do hear the prison ambiance through the surrounds.  For example, when Malik is working at the sewing shop, you can hear the machines through the surrounds.  And you also get good use of the surrounds during the more action driven sequences such as the shooting scenes or a person being kicked and beaten.

The film also utilizes music such as its primary score courtesy of Alexandre Desplat (""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""Lust Caution"", ""The Valet"", etc.).  Desplate does a wonderful job with the score in developing the overall somber mood of the film.  Also, the film utilizes modern hip hop and rock tracks which is deep with bass and quite clear through the front channels.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, German and Turkish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""A Prophet"" comes with the following special features (in standard definition, French stereo and with English and German subtitles):

  * Commentary with Director Jacques Audiard, Actor Tahar Rahim and Co-Writer Thomas Bidegain - An audio commentary track which gives you really good insight of the film, working with the various cast members, the technical issues of filming in a prison and more.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""A Prophet"" is a film that is a fantastic film that is well-written, well-directed and more than anything, both Tahar Rahim and Niels Arestrup do a wonderful job with their role.  Perfectly time interaction and the film while long at 155 minutes, was well-written and helped develop the characters, especially Malik's journey as the quiet prisoner to seeing him evolve into something quite different.

Needless to say, ""A Prophet"" is a survival film.  Malik does all he can to survive within the next six years and that is by remaining close to the Corsican mafia (who treat him like a dog because he's Arabic) while trying to keep his reputation cool among the Arabs.  If anything, we learn first hand of how difficult it is for Malik as he must obey Luciani in order to survive the corrupted prison system but also making sure to maintain communication with other people in prison to ensure the success of his business and also helping those who are with him.

With that being said, the film does have its share of violent moments and for the faint-hearted, especially for those who don't like seeing blood, this film does have a very bloody scene.  One scene has Malik being trained by the Corsican mafia on how he is to kill Reyeb.  In the scene, Malik is to pretend he is about to give Reyeb oral but with a blade hidden in his mouth, Malik has to slice the carotid artery on Reyeb's neck.  Let's just say that things get bloody in this scene. Other scenes feature Malik being kicked in the ground, punched, nearly eye gouged.

But these scenes are necessary to show how a man can change in prison and it has a psychological toll on Malik as he begins to see the man he has killed in his room and begins to have a conversation with him.  May it be guilt and this man haunts Malik's inner conscience but the truth is, while in prison and with no one to trust but his one friend Ryad (played by Adel Bencherif), all Malik has is this ghost of Reyeb.  Possibly to remind him of his innocence that was stripped away by the Corsican mafia.  We see how this man go from this silent loner, we see him evolve to a new kind of man and everything plays out quite wonderfully at the end.

There have been a good number of well-created prison films in the past 50 years such as ""Grand Illusion"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Le Trou"", ""Stalag 17', etc.  With most dealing with prison escapees to police or someone disguising themselves as prisoners trying to obtain information from a criminal.  And while survival in prison has been featured in a variety of films,  ""A Prophet"" is probably the first film in which a writer and director has attempted (and in this case succeeding) in depicting one man's survival while being in the most corrupted and dangerous place to be.  Having to lean on those who want to use you, corrupt you and rob you of your innocence and thus changing you in the process.

This is one grueling journey for the protagonist and at 155-minutes, it's definitely a film that requires one's patience.  As for its title, ""A Prophet"" comes from one of the crime bosses in which Malik has to meet (which Luciani has arranged with his people in the outside).  Malik has a dream the night before about driving and seeing a lot of deer and a deer sign and sure enough, while in the car with the crime boss, he quickly remembers the deer by seeing the deer sign and warns the people in the car that they are about to get into an accident.  The car manages to hit only one but Malik's warning enables him to save the lives of the criminals, the crime boss asks Malik how he knew those deer were coming and if he is some kind of prophet.

The title has nothing to do with Malik having dreams that come true (with the exception of the deer incident) but more or less, a man who learns the hard way of survival from a top mafia boss and learns about the shady practices of well-connected criminals in the prison system and eventually utilizing the things he has learned and making the best out of it.

Although the film has received mostly positive reviews, there are some who challenge the film's plot of Malik being able to leave the prison system for ""leave days"" which are given to low-incident criminals.  With Luciani's connection with the warden and the outside, Luciani depends on Malik handling some business for him while on his leave day.

Donald Levit of ""ReelTalk Movie Reviews"" writes, ""Malik may have a plan or may wing it, but too many things fly too fast and furiously -- a first, seconds-long airplane ride (nicely done); a mosque and imam, cached kilos and Egyptians; a highway deer-crossing sign and an outdoor beach restaurant lunch; an increasing Muslim prison population and transfers or releases for fifteen of the twenty Corsicans; a bafflingly complicated and carried out Mace attack and van rub out.""

Levit does have a point but I believe that is why the duration of the film was long.  Director and writer Jacques Audiard and co-writer Thomas Bidegain wanted to show how powerful the Corsican mafia boss C&eacute;sar Luciani truly is.  We see this man having access to the best cell, television, food, clothing and even having access to a hidden cell phone.  We know that the warden has been aiding Luciani and of course, whenever someone from the outside is meeting with him, he is literally conducting business and uses Malik and his weakness and fear in doing these jobs (which can easily get himself killed).  But Luciani is well-connected and is able to make things happen for Malik in the outside world.

A lot of things do happen in the second half of the film and I can see where Donald Levit is coming from with his assessment of the scenarios.  He also comments on the many players in the film.  And yes, there are many players in the prison system that Malik has to interact with in the film.  But in the end, all that matters is Malik's business relationship with Luciani and his business relationship and friendship with Ryad.

As for the Blu-ray release, this is a solid release from Sony Pictures Classics.  The picture quality is fantastic and although audio-wise, this is not a film that utilizes the surround channel in full-effect and is primarily dialogue-driven, you do get a good number of special features.  The deleted scenes offers more insight to the film that can easily be added to the film and would make sense but in terms of pacing and duration time, at 155-minutes, I think by adding these scenes may be a bit overkill for viewers.

I suppose if I had to be nitpicky and what prevents this Blu-ray release from receiving a 5-star is that I was hoping to see some sort of featurette of the making of the film.  Sony Pictures Classics definitely set the ladder high with their Blu-ray release of ""The White Ribbon"" with its number of awesome and lengthy special features.  For ""A Prophet"", the screen tests and rehearsals were fine but for a film of this caliber, it would have bee nice to see a featurette on the making of this film or clips from the C&eacute;sar Awards where it the film would become the first in nearly three decades to win nine C&eacute;sar awards (and nominated for 13).  But again, that's me being nitpicky.

Overall, ""A Prophet"" is a magnificent film and I hope it will encourage many cinema fans who are not familiar with Jacques Audiard's films to go out and search his previous films.  In the case of ""A Prophet"", definitely compelling cinema that is thought-provoking, raw and violent but easily another well-crafted masterpiece from Jacques Audiard.

A Prophet follows a young Arab, Malik (a tremendous performance by Tahar Rahim) who is new to prison, sentenced on an assault charge. He comes under the wing of a Corsican mobster who rules the prison. Many things ensue which end up making Malik more powerful and the mob dude less so.

It's difficult to say how powerful this movie is. All the performances are great. The music is great. And it's exceptionally well directed. And this is no fancy movie. There is a lot of hand held camera and no fancy sets or frou frou. Audiard just knows how to make things happen in the frame and got himself the right camera guy who always seemed to know where to put the lens.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this the big FIVE stars is that I had a difficult time remembering who some of the players were outside of the prison. So when the whip came down in the climax I wasn't certain exactly what happened. I'm sure this would right itself with a second viewing, but, that being said, this is still one heck of a flick.

3896652,4,B002BWP3UC,"Jacques Audiard's  'A Prophet' is a mesmerizing drama. It manages to combine the elements of a prison film with the excitment of a crime thriller and despite it's two and a half hour length is gripping from start to finish.

The plot of 'A Prophet' follows the six year prison sentance of an Arab named Malik. Malik is quiet and illiterate but is given protection by the Corsican mafia if he helps them with their Arab rivals. After performing a murder, Malik is haunted by his victim's ghost as he gains repect from the Corsicans but decides to start making some plays for himself and forms his own connections in the criminal world. After gaining some power Malik pits both mafia gangs against each other. The story is very long and very violent with some plot threads that seem underdeveloped, but watching Malik change from shy-loner to self-assured kingpin is absolutely mesmerizing.

The acting in 'A Prophet' is fantastic as every characterization comes across so naturally you'd swear you were watching a documentary. Tahar Rahim is the obvious stand-out as Malik and deserves all the recognition he gets. Equally good is Niels Arestrup as the Corsican mob boss who starts to trust Malik but can't quite put a finger on his motives.

The film work in 'A Prophet' is excellent and the gritty prison shots will remind alot of people of HBO's 'Oz'. These scenes are perfectly contrasted to the ones shot outside the prison as the character Malik earnes 12-hour parole days (which he uses to carry out the mafia work). He feels the relief of wind on his face and you're feeling it with him. There's even some great camera shots as the director mixes quick-action cuts and slow tension building ones. This is the work of a professional!

As I said before 'A Prophet' is long film but is so engaging you won't notice. Some character story's seem a bit unresolved but I think that goes hand-in-hand with the movie's ominous ending. If you're a fan of french crime film and don't mind some prison drama mixed in 'A Prophet' is a must see!",1280966400,5,2038,4.697478991596639
3896653,5,B002BWP3UC,"A PROPHET ('Un prophte') is a mesmerizing film, so involved in complex subplots that the viewer's attention must stay on alert lest any aspects of this gripping film escape appreciation - despite its long (155 minute) duration.  The redoubtable Jacques Audiard directs this tale written by Abdel Raouf Dafri and Nicholas Peufaillit and adapted for this film by Thomas Bidegain and Audiard himself. Almost all of the film takes place within prison walls with occasional (and very important) tours outside the prison) and with the cinematography of Stphane Fontaine the atmosphere is appropriately claustrophobic for the story to emerge as dark and mysterious as it does.  A musical score by Alexandre Desplat once again proves that this composer is able to capture the mood of a piece and enhance it without drawing attention to the actual music we are hearing.

Malik (Tahar Rahim) is only 19 years old, illiterate, an orphan of the streets who is bilingual in Arabic and French, when he is imprisoned for assaulting a gendarme.  He resents every aspect of his entry into prison but decides to remain alone and a anonymous as possible until his sentence is completed.  But prison life has a different plan for him: noticing that Malik does not congregate with his fellow Muslim inmates, the Corsicans pick him as a cohort - mob boss Csar Luciani may be cold but he is powerful and promises Malik 'protection' if Malik consents to kill Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi), a threat to the Corsicans.  Malik is terrified of the 'project' but fears the recourse if he should not comply, and so he manages to kill Rayeb - an act that causes him great emotional turmoil and follows him in the manner of Rayeb's ghostlike presence haunting him throughout his imprisonment. Malik is thus attached to the Corsicans, learns to read and write, and makes friends with two
other similar Arabs, Ryad (Adel Bencherif) and Jordi the Gypsy (Reda Kateb) and the three become involved in drug trafficking.  Csar manages to gain a day leave situation for Malik and with each of these criminally centered turns outside prison walls Malik becomes more and more powerful in his courage to do the near impossible.  As time passes the Corsicans are returned to Corsica (they had been political prisoners), except for Csar who is not eligible for transfer.  As Malik becomes more self sufficient and more involved with drug smuggling both inside and outside the prison, Csar loses control until Malik is calling the shots.  By the time of his release, Malik has 'grown' into a practiced criminal - but with a specific soft side that has also developed from his prison experience.

The film is all the more strong because of the impeccably fine performance by Tahir Rahim - a very young actor about whom we will be hearing much more.  This is a dark and often depressing film, but the may in which it is directed and acted makes it a very powerful work.  Grady Harp, August 10",1280966400,,2937,4.826693227091633

I had picked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Serious-Man-Blu-ray/dp/B002E2M5IC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Serious Man [Blu-ray</a>] as my top favorite, but now, after seeing this twice, I declare ""A Prophet"" to be the best film - domestic or foreign - of 2009.

Perhaps I am biased though. After all, I LOVE gangster films, crime films, and prison films. But ""A Prophet"" is not merely a gangster film or a crime film, and it's certainly not a prison film. ""A Prophet"" is a potent and affective blend of all three genres.

Like all great films, you find yourself rooting for the film's protagonist, who, in this case, evolves into a real rough-and-tumble criminal by the end of the second act. And this evolution or transformation, or whatever you wanna call it...is truly remarkable.

The video quality is absolutely superb; so superb in fact, you'll forget you're watching a movie. This is a dynamite video presentation. This is reference quality.

The audio quality is also flawless. Listen to the ""Eyes and Ears"" montage, wherein Nas spits ""Bridging the Gap."" Not only is the choice of song perfect, but the music and other effects are well-balanced.

The commentary track is a little hard to follow...but that's because I don't speak French (but hey, you can read the subtitles). The other features are worth a viewing, but don't expect a high replay value

In conclusion, ""A Prophet"" is my official pick for ""best film of 2009."" I was captivated and amazed at every turn. Indeed, this is a masterpiece.

Oh...and by the way: I NEVER struggled when reading the subtitles. So don't let that keep you from enjoying this outstanding film.",1280361600,4,1841,5.195945945945946
3896655,5,B002BWP3UC,"A prophet is a true masterpiece. It explores the raise and full development of a young newcomer into a prison.

He is just 19 and although he walks alone and tries to stand aloof from the crowd, he will be engaged very soon, when he is ""hired"" to make a job as part of the well known initiation's ritual in this human jungle where only the strong survives.

The movie is extremely violent filled of tension. Filmed according the patterns of ""cinema verite"" with camera in hand exploring the insights of every single movement, detail, grimace. A hopeless environment where nobody is safe and the friendship is absent because only the dark interests prevail.

The film is disturbing but absorbing. A dynamic plot that involves us a Corsican who intends to control the state of things until this huge wave works out as a enormous boomerang against him.

All the deserved awards for this singular masterwork. Admirable and impressing. You will never forget it.

There was a dark and somber film that dealt with a similar plot in the middle seventies (1975) ""The brutalizing of Franz Blum"" from the renowned German filmmaker Reinhard Hauff. It should be interesting to watch it to establish pertinent comparisons.

Tahar Rahim exhibits punch and actoral force. He reminds me to the young Pacino. He has in the screen a promisory future.",1275350400,3,1331,4.841409691629956

He becomes the means to a murderous end for fellow inmate the Corsican mob and thus begins his descent into its servitude. Ironically, it is his position as their dirty Arab that provides his escape.

Propelled by stellar, stoic acting on Tahar Rahim's behalf, this story gripped me from blinded beginning to free end. Throughout the film you empathize with Malik. He's as much if not more a victim of his environment as he is a Machiavellian strategist gripping all opportunities available to him. It's not always pleasant to watch his endeavors, but they have an authenticity, a type of logic, that is followed until the end.

An amazing film that has made a fan where previously only an aversion to its subject matter existed, Un Prophte deserves all the praise it gets.",1273190400,51,947,4.839506172839506

3896658,5,B002BWP3UC,"'A Prophet' settles it: Jacques Audiard is the best filmmaker working today.  His previous two films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Read-My-Lips/dp/B00009OOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Read My Lips</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beat-That-My-Heart-Skipped/dp/B000B9EYFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beat That My Heart Skipped</a>) were superb, but 'A Prophet' is his best creation so far.  For me, it's the best film of 2009. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film but was beaten out by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Secreto-De-Sus-Ojos-The-Secret-in-Their-Eyes/dp/B003C0VFZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Secreto De Sus Ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes)</a>.  I'll reserve judgment until I see that one, too, but it's hard to believe it's a better movie than Audiard's.

As another reviewer aptly notes on these pages, 'A Prophet' has more than subtle shades of 'The Godfather.'  French Arab Malik (an amazing Tahar Rahim) starts the movie as a callow 19-year-old entering prison.  Quickly, he's selected to carry out a hit by the Corsican gang that rules the prison.  The hit itself is excruciatingly intense movie-making.  The pressure was suffocating.  [At least one fellow movie-goer left the theater and didn't return.]

After carrying out that task, Malik is protected by Csar Luciani (an equally mesmerizing Niels Arestrup) leader of the Corsicans in prison.  In fact, Luciani effectively runs the prison.  Thus begins a life for Malik in which the Corsicans see him as an Arab and the Arabs as a Corsican.  But Malik proves himself more than an errand boy.  As Malik is told by the character Reyeb, ""the idea is to come out smarter than you came in.""  Reyeb is talking about book-smart intelligence, and - while Malik does take and excel at literacy training - Reyeb's epigram holds deeper meaning as well.  Malik slowly builds confidence, bravado and cunning to the point where he's running a massively complicated scheme (both in and out of prison) in which he expertly plays off four sides against each other.

As we watch Malik's transformation, we see the transformation of the prison yard as well.  Csar learns too well that you can't fight demographics.  Starting with a band of 20+ loyalists, he first watches his team gutted by a Sarkozy decree moving a bulk of the Corsicans to another institution.  Then, the yard turns more Arab.  Csar starts relying on Malik more than he'd like.  And when Malik puts his jaw-dropping in/out double-cross game into play, the last of Csar's inner circle turns on itself.

In thinking about this film, I realized just what a massive undertaking Audiard has unfolded story-wise.  In even trying to capture the essence of all the critical plot points, this review could easily extend for pages.  At the two-hour mark, I thought:  ""wow, it's going to take at least another 30 minutes to resolve all this drama."" Sure enough, the movie clocks in at 2 hours 35 minutes.  It's worth every minute of your time to see this masterpiece of cinema.",1269820800,40,3135,5.628997867803838
3896659,5,B002BWP3UC,"Coincidentally, I watched this movie the night of the Oscars. After watching it I couldn't help feeling that, none of the 10 Best Picture nominees could stand up to this. But if the past is anything to go by, just like the brilliant Gomorrah last year, this will go largely unseen.

It also makes one realize how sanitized our hollywood studio movies have become. A very simple scene of Malik practicing hiding a razor blade inside his mouth is more captivating than anything which the studios have produced in recent times.

The movie is 150 minutes long but the narrative never lags and it is absolutely relentless in moving the story forward.

When the French get things right, they absolutely hit the spot.",1269475200,3,710,4.7560975609756095
3896660,5,B002BWP3UC,"As we left the theater, my companion and I began to talk about the characters in ""A Prophet"", the new French film by director Jaques Audiard (""Read My Lips""). We wanted to know what was going to happen to Malik, the lead character, after the narrative of the film ends.

How often do you leave a movie so invested in the characters and their lives that you talk about what might happen to them next? I rarely do and I see a lot of films. I can't imagine this is a common occurrence for most people so when it happens, you take notice.

Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) arrives at prison to begin his six year sentence. We quickly learn some of the reasons this 19 year old has been incarcerated as he meets with his Public Defense lawyer and the guard checking him into the prison. Malik has no one (""Who will you receive money orders from?"") and his French/ Arab ethnicity has made him a bit of an outcast in society. Both of these factors have led him to a life of crime. Now that he is 19, the punishment for his crimes is his first stay in a real prison; his previous crimes resulted in stays at youth facilities. Terrified and scared, Malik enters the prison yard and stands alone, trying to get by. Soon, Cesar (Niels Arestrup, ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"", ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly""), head of a group of Corsican thugs who run the prison, spots him and wants him to do a job for him. Cesar has been ordered to kill a Muslim prisoner who is being held temporarily in the prison before testifying about one of Cesar's associates. The gangster notices that the informer is interested in Malik. Cesar and his goons move in and give him an ultimatum; kill the Muslim and become a part of their group or feel the wrath. As time passes, Malik becomes a reluctant member of Cesar's group, trusted to a degree, he moves up the prison hierarchy thanks to his mentor. But as he is Arab, he is still treated like dirt by his same friends, mentors and companions. Then, President Sarkozy orders most of the Corsicans to be moved from French prisons to another location. Most of Cesar's henchmen are moved and the gangster finds he must rely on Malik more than he would like. As time passes, Malik begins to take classes and learn how to read and write. But he also learns other valuable lessons which benefit him as a prisoner and will continue to benefit him once he is released.

Written and directed by Jaques Audiard, ""A Prophet"" is an intelligent, well-made character study about one man's journey to prison. Remarkably involving, we feel like we are taking the journey along with Malik, experiencing the good and bad as he does.

As he is processed to enter the facility, we can see a tremble in Malik's hands. He is clearly not a hardened criminal and his public defender confirms as much. Because of his age, this will be his first stay in a real prison. But this also hints at the life Malik has led to this point. As the guard goes about his duties, he asks if Malik will receive any visitors, if he will get any money from anyone and Malik answers no, he has no one. In these few moments, we get a very complete picture of who Malik is as he enters the prison.

Part of the beauty of ""A Prophet"" is that we follow Malik's journey throughout his stay and his journey involves a lot of growth. As he becomes a disciple of Cesar, he earns a certain amount of protection and freedom to accompany the 'friendship' of his new mentor. But Cesar and his crew are hardline Corsican criminals (the film paints them as a tough bunch) and they don't mix well with the Arabs and Muslims who are now a part of the prison community. Malik is a mixture of French and Muslim, which is why they approach him in the first place. Once he earns his place in their group, they accept him, more or less, because he of his mixed heritage. The Muslim part is only acceptable because he is at least part French.

Throughout, Cesar's crew seems to barely accept Malik. Even when Cesar seems to be genuinely fond of his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, he can't express his true feelings because of the deep seated racism the rest of his crew holds. Therefore, Malik sits at a separate table, cleans up after the rest, does their menial chores and the like.

As time passes, Cesar comes to depend on Malik more. At one point, a large number of the prisoner's in the gangster's crew are moved to another prison, so he moves Malik into a more prominent position more out of necessity than anything else. When Malik proves himself worthy of the new responsibilities, he gets more and more.

But Malik's education continues on other fronts. He learns to read and starts to take classes. As he becomes smarter, he realizes he wants to embrace his religion more and seeks guidance from friends in the prison. Naturally, these friends give him a more complete picture of what being an Arab means and start to instill some pride in him. And as he continues to learn, he learns how to manipulate events to his benefit.

I think the beauty of Audiard's work is that while he may be using a B-Movie template for the framework of his films, he invests the characters populating these landscapes with so much detail it is hard to not get involved in their lives. In ""Read My Lips"", he uses a Hitchcock-ian narrative as a springboard and gives the characters so much more interest, back-story and human interest that is difficult to remember any of the hackneyed Hitchcock tributes Brian DePalma attempted. In ""Prophet"", he uses the prison story as a backdrop but makes it more intimate and personal by concentrating the story on a single young man making his way through a prison system he can't comprehend.

In ""A Prophet"", the key to the film is watching Malik learn. As we witness his journey, we watch what he experiences through his eyes, we make the journey with him. We learn with him. And as his knowledge expands, we see him begin to piece things together. Even as he continues to learn, he watches everything happening around him with wide eyes, making him seem a little vulnerable but also very curious. Because we are watching through his eyes, there is a little suspense as we piece together what he is piecing together. We watch everything start to click together. When the shift happens, it is pretty subtle but there is a little bit of strength in his expression, in his mannerisms that wasn't there before. It is almost a little thrilling to watch.

As I watched ""A Prophet"", I was struck by something else. Despite the film's setting and subject matter, there is relatively little violence. There are a few moments, but they serve the story, moving it forward.
