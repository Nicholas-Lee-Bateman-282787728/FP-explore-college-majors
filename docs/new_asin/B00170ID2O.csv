8264413,2,B00170ID2O,"Least entertaining of the Kane DVDs (except for the commercials).  Includes a less-than-stellar portrayal of Kane by Mark Stevens.  Also contains two superior William Gargan episodes, but one is a renamed show from Vol. 1 (about the lady ""psychic"").  Completists will want this DVD, however.",1395705600,,291,5.4222222222222225
8264414,4,B00170ID2O,If you are into nostalgic film this is for you. I enjoyed this as much or more than I did when I was a kid and first saw them. Several short 1/2 hour films.,1379635200,,156,3.6176470588235294
