6878662,4,B00QSP5V5A,The discs are a blast from the past.  Wish they had the original commercials too.  Will help viewers to know something of 1960s politics for sure.  Great service on delivery.,1437350400,2,174,4.733333333333333
6878663,5,B00QSP5V5A,"It's amazing how relevant these old Laugh-In shows are today.  Even the kids who don't recognize the old celebrities (John Wayne, Joey Bishop?) will understand the issues immediately.  Funny, funny, funny, and Goldie Hawn at 20 was just incandescent.  Lordy.",1436745600,9,258,5.4
6878664,5,B00QSP5V5A,Still funny after all these years.  Amazing list of cameo appearances.,1433548800,2,70,5.363636363636363
6878665,5,B00QSP5V5A,"I bought this directly from the manufacturer at getlaughin.com for $29.95 plus shipping & handling. My order arrived in under a week.  (UPDATE 2/6/17: the getlaughin.com website appears to no longer be in business. I suspect the DVD set is no longer being made. Buyers might want to check prices on eBay in addition to the used and new listings here on amazon to find the best price.)

This DVD set is made up of the three Laugh-In TV specials that were broadcast in the mid-1990s. Most of the material is taken from the classic TV series of the late 1960s to early 1970s, with some occasional added commentary by a few of the original cast members. The ""Christmas Past and Present"" special is here retitled ""Laugh-In Looks at The Holidays"" for some reason. There are a few clips about New Years Eve, Easter, and Independence Day, but it mostly centers on Christmas.

Video quality of the old segments is not pristine - it is grainy and a little faded, but it's quite acceptable. The color saturation on the network broadcast of the Christmas special was richer, based on my old VHS copy I recorded at the time. The comedy content remains wonderful, endless jokes, lots of laughs and a lot of big stars, great to see this again.",1430352000,23,1228,4.598173515981735

6878683,5,B00QSP5V5A,Laugh-in was a great show. Why do I have to settle for best of collections when what I really want is to buy the complete series ? It would be even better if the complete series would include bloopers. The bloopers from this show are excellent. And why on Earth are the best of part one and two nearly $150 ? That seems more like a fair price for the entire show than for a few sample shows..,1443225600,14,392,4.038461538461538

8692690,4,B00QSP5V5A,"This was the only real Laugh-In package on the market until very recently. Last June, the complete series became available for the first time but only as a mondo 38-disc set. Then they started releasing the full individual seasons (Season 1, from 1968, came out in September 2017) on a staggered schedule. The release schedule is now up to Season 3, which appeared in March 2018, with more to come. In my opinion, the first three years of Laugh-In constitute the essential material, before the inevitable decline set in. The Producer's Collection is fun but pretty scrambled (with bits and pieces from all six seasons), although that's not all that much of a problem since the show itself was helter-skelter by design. In any case, the price for this package is now ridiculously high (for reasons unknown) so just move on to the straight stuff.",1521331200,,844,4.827586206896552

8692693,3,B00QSP5V5A,Very funny but much shorter time than expected on dvds.  I expected some continuity. Value in my opinion is about $29.,1489795200,2,118,4.619047619047619

8692697,4,B00QSP5V5A,"ROWAN & MARTIN 'S LAUGH-IN: The late sixties' funky, funny, fast paced salute to sex, politics and slapstick, Laugh-In proved a launch pad for the careers of Goldie Hawn and Lily Tomlin as well as an obvious influence on Hee Haw and The Banana Splits. Arte Johnson's dirty old man Tyrone Horniegh (the perfect foil for Ruth Buzzi's purse swinging spinster Gladys Ormphby), Gary Owens' droll announcer, Tomlin's snarky, snorting phone operator Ernestine, brassy Joanne Worley's chicken jokes, and Henry Gibson's flower bearing poet were just a few of the kooky characters running amuck in the asylum. Guest stars running the gamut from Tiny Tim to John Wayne, graffiti clad go-go dancers, blackout skits, host Dan Rowan and Dick Martin's wordplay monologues, and an arsenal of catch phrases (""You bet your sweet Bippy"", ""Look that up in your Funk & Wagnalls"", ""Sock it to me!"") made Laugh-In the hippest, most hilarious hour ever to invade the groove tube.
