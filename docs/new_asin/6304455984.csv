885150,4,6304455984,"It was always obvious that Kevin Spacey would only ever assemble a first rate cast for his first movie as director, and he was as discerning with his choice of script as director as he is with his acting jobs.  This  movie plays like a play and tellingly the best performances come from the  stage actors.  Gary Sinise delivers a controlled performance that  demonstrates the humanity of his character, while William Fichtner manages  to carry the bulk of the humour and the horror without going over the top.  The script and Spacey's direction keep the tension high despite being  confined to one room for much of the movie (think 12 Angry Men - Spacey  actually consulted Sidney Lumet for advice).
Where the film falls down is  in the weak performances of two of the most important characters, played by  Matt Dillon and Faye Dunaway.  Both performances are one-dimensional and  affected (and Dunaway has the complexion of a Barbie doll - plastic). The  rest of the cast has little to do but make the most of what they have  (especially M. Emmett Walsh).
See this movie.  There are a lot of worse  and more successful movies out there than this one.  Quality's very rare  these days.  So make the most of it.",944006400,13,1210,4.644549763033176
885151,1,6304455984,Only Sinise's performance as the crook with a heart and Dunaway's tough but motherly bar maid saved this from untimate disaster.  If it had a reason for being I failed to discern it. Same thing goes for a plot,920764800,,209,4.358974358974359
885256,3,6304455984,"There's a superb cast assembled here. You have Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, Joe Mantegna and several others. It's like a play - primarily set in one small, claustrophobic basement bar with only one exit. There's a trio of brothers who are petty thieves who take the few bar people hostage while they try to think their way out of their mess. In the meantime the cops and news reporters do their usual dances outside.

This is of course a theme that's been done many, many times in many situations. How the hostage-takers each have different views on what to do and fight amongst themselves. How the hostages first rebel against the situation and then try to work with the captors in order to work things out. How the newscasters ""screw things up"" for the cops by broadcasting information they shouldn't.

I really appreciated that, while the movie is inherently about violence and threatened violence, that they didn't make the movie about gore. They explicitly set scenes up so that you see what's coming - but you don't see the actual damage. You see the results reflected in the eyes of the actors. It's about the emotion and the impact.

The problem isn't the directing - Kevin Spacey does a nice job of framing the shots and setting the pace. You feel the tension build as the characters stay locked in this small space for hour after hour. The problem isn't the actors either - each of the actors gives their character a sense of honest realism that reflects their skills.

The problem isn't the ""setup"" either - most plays are set up exactly like this one and many of those do fantastically well on the movie screen. I could name a ton of movies that are set primarily in one room, where that helps the characters to shine.

The issue here is the writing. You can see the actors really struggle to deliver the lines with feeling - but it can be really difficult. First, the 3 brothers. Matt Dillon's character is a not-smart flip-flopper who starts to agree with whoever talked with him last. William Fichtner is the psychotic one who wants to kill everyone - he even slugs his own brother for the hell of it. Gary Sinese is the smart brother, but he doesn't have much influence over his brothers. The dynamics between these three could really have been incredible - but instead the dialogue makes it frustrating and at times inane. When characters start dropping, you really are rooting for some of the brothers to go.

The bar patrons really aren't fleshed out enough for you to care much about them. In fact, Faye's character comes off rather rough at the beginning - especially with her son being there, it's hard to believe she'd really antagonize the gun-toting criminals as much as she does. Viggo's character, as the super-quiet Canadian, has almost zero personality. His great talent with languages could really have been shown off, given that the character seems to be French speaking, but it isn't.

In all, there was huge potential - but the script's flaws were just too large to overcome. I found the experience quite unsatisfying.",1148342400,2,3066,4.708955223880597

The movie revolves around three desparate second rate crooks that get themselves in a mess and end up taking a tavern's patrons hostage.

But Matt Dillion's tough guy routine seems a little forced, and by the end of the film it's a little tired. However, this is suitable start as Spacey's debut.

""That would have been a very scary set if you had a director who wasn't an actor's director,"" said Matt Dillon, who plays the hoodlum leader. ""Each week got more and more intense."" Dillon plays a morally ambiguous character unsure of what to do after he and his partners set off a burglar alarm, flee in panic, then become mistaken targets of a siege commanded by federal agents seeking a gun-smuggler.

885261,2,6304455984,"The selection at Blockbuster seemed unusually dreary, so I focused on ALBINO ALLIGATOR for the simple reason that Faye Dunaway was in the cast, and I hadn't seen her in awhile. I admit to having a mild crush on her since the original THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.
Matt Dillon, Gary Sinise and William Fichtner star as three small-time, New Orleans crooks who bungle a warehouse heist, and then take refuge in a basement bar after being involved in an auto accident during the getaway, at which time the Sinise character is injured going through the windshield. And, by the way, during the getaway they mash into the pavement a cop involved in an unrelated Federal stakeout. At any rate, once in the bar, which has no rear entrance, they're surrounded by the local SWAT team and assorted TV news vans. However, they do have five hostages: the bar's owner, the bartender (Dunaway), and three wee hour customers.
ALBINO ALLIGATOR is the directorial debut of Kevin Spacey, an actor of considerable talent. While I won't go so far as to say that this first effort was badly directed, the script wasn't worth his time and energy. Unless he's more selective, Kevin should stay with his bread-and-butter job. Curiously, the film just didn't have that ""movie"" feel. It reminded me more of a filmed stage production. Furthermore, the ""albino alligator"" reference, ostensibly a ruse by which alligators send out an albino to flush out foes, had absolutely no application in the storyline. At least, none that I discerned even after thinking about it for several minutes. I was even watching with my glasses on. To be evenhanded, the Fichtner character, a real psycho, was chillingly done. And Faye is still a Babe, even at this late date. On the other hand, the Dillon and Sinise characters, plus the cop-in-charge role-played by Joe Mantegna, were notably nondescript. And what illegal substance was somebody on when that Guy character was envisioned? (Was this an actors' afternoon workshop, by any chance?)
The film's greatest weakness, for me, was the ending. Without giving anything away, the survivors of the ordeal were not all those you'd expect. I got the feeling the scriptwriter was trying to illustrate a great truth - a ""morale to the story"", so to speak. Somebody please tell me what it was!",982022400,4,2285,4.891752577319588

885263,4,6304455984,"ALBINO ALLIGATOR, Kevin Spacey's first movie as a director, is clearly divided into two distinctive parts. A prologue consisting in a tragic car chase and the confrontation of eight characters trapped in an old speakeasy  in New-Orleans.
During this second part of the film, I felt like watching  one of these old movies inspired by Tennesse Williams's plays. Do you  remember Kazan's A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, Mankiewicz's SUDDENLY LAST  SUMMER or Brooks's CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF ? Well, in ALBINO ALLIGATOR, you  are going to visit once again the sweaty world of the south, the (heavy...)  sexual symbols so present in Tennesse Williams's plays as, for example in  ALBINO ALLIGATOR  the tunnel leading to nowhere land and, naturally, the  eternal figure of THE MOTHER, present like Faye Dunaway or missing like  William Fichtner's mom.

885264,2,6304455984,"When a new screenwriter is trying to get his script made, the best way to draw attention (nee money) is to attach a star, someone with visibility, someone bankable. Surprisingly, I don't think stars really read a lot of  scripts, certainly not all the way through, certainly not with a mindset  toward how to make this into a good, completed film.
At the time this  film was made, Kevin Spacey was hot, very hot. His performances in Seven,  Swimming with Sharks, and The Usual Suspects had brought him not only rave  reviews, but an Academy Award. His want to direct, this inherent heat, plus  his ability to attract additional star power, namely Faye Dunaway, Matt  Dillon,  and Gary Sinise, and a spec script from a first time writer had  the financial backing it needed.
Maybe Albino Alligator would have been a  weak film in even the most accomplished hands, it certainly is a weak film  in this first time director's. The premise is sketchy, the through line  distorted and vague. Some of the characterizations seem forced, or  contrived, as if, for example, Faye Dunaway (or Gary Sinise)'s part were  quickly created or expanded to accommodate their agreeing to  particpate.

OK, that makes this a hostage movie with a twist but is it any good?

Hostage movies depend almost entirely on the development of chemistry between the three parties involved, the hostages, the hostage takers and the cops. That is where this movie lets itself down.

The cops - in this case the ATF - are nowhere, A.T.F. Agent G.D. Browning (Joe Mantegna) does get the funniest line in the whole movie but that's about it for law enforcement. So we are just left with the bad guys and the bar flies.

Dova (Matt Dillon) and Milo (Gary Sinise) are brothers and together with Law (William Fichtner) they make up a mismatched set of crooks. Law has a simple bottom line: he will not return to prison and he is prepared to kill everyone in the bar if it keeps him out of jail. Milo, badly hurt in the car chase, doesn't agree but is in no position to assert his will and falls into despair. Dova struggles to keep peace between his brother and his friend but it is a struggle that he must ultimately lose.

It's Dino's (M. Emmet Walsh) bar but Walsh gets pretty well no script to work with which is a shame. Barhelp Janet Boudreaux (Faye Dunaway) gets more and Dunaway does a great job with what she has to work with but any real interplay between her and the gang is more a hint of potential than a realisation. Watch Dog Day Afternoon and see how Al Pacino and Penelope Allen pull this one off. Dillon may be no Pacino but Dunaway is a fine actress and together they should have been able to make it - they just don't have quite enough script to work with.

Guy Foucard (Viggo Mortensen) is a real disappointment. He is not entirely to blame - the script does him no favours - but more importantly, he is miscast here. When you have seen this movie, try to imagine it with Steve Buscemi playing this role, it would not have turned this into a great movie but it would have moved it up a notch.

It was Kevin Spacey's debut as a director and while it was good enough to justify letting him have another go (it was a long time coming) many of the movies problems arose from the directing and the script.",1292630400,2,2268,4.248259860788863
7872303,3,6304455984,"The transition from actor to director is not always as easy as it seems. Sometimes it takes years to make the transition, and that is quite apparent with Kevin Spacey's Albino Alligator. Spacey attempts to hit a homerun on his first at bat but ends up getting a solid single instead.

The film deals with a botched heist (not the sort of story-line that is exactly lacking in Hollywood these days) and the relationships between the three main criminals. What we see is the thin lines between loyalty and survival, and the great lengths some will go to ensure their own preservation, even at the expense of those closest to them.

There are moments in intense drama throughout the film, and a climax that you probably won't see coming, but overall, Albino Alligator reminds me of that glass of water in the middle of the night. It's refreshing, but if you weren't so tired and were able to pour a glass of something else, you would. This is lazy-day-watch-it-on-IFC entertainment, not go-out-of-your-way-to-rent-it entertainment.",1208304000,5,1028,4.936416184971098

A gang of crooks. The perfect plan. It all goes wrong. They're in trouble. The police are outside. They're cornered. What are they gonna do now?

Sound familiar?

The movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the ""indie"" film and the theater.

It's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up.

A trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. To top things off, there's a bit of a ""fender-bender"" and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield.

The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically (and leadenly) ""Dino's Last Chance.""

Spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge. He pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And he keeps all the violence off-screen, really.

I think that was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge.

The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. Matt Dillon (""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""Wild Things"") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang.

Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs, but he isn't given anything to really do here.

William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood.

And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this.

Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. The characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they're to calm and too articulate. There's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. At one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. Oh brother. Oh bother.

These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. Shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? Meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside.

Someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. But...

Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her New Orleans accent. And Skeet Ullrich is fine in a small part.

A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield.

The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful.

The movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's ""not bad, but needs a few more re-writes."" Spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for ""shaping a movie"" and it feels like he's just filming actors act.

These actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. As I said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting.

I don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. I think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely.

Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack, Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping Fischter in his ""bloodthirsty goon"" part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb. That would have been a big improvement.

When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for it. But a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. Just shoot the actors acting.

Sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. An excuse for it.

Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well.

There are a few really great entries into this genre.' Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: ""The Negotiator.""

This certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of AFI's 100. Still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV. It's just not worth going out of your way to see.

I give a 3 out of 10. Better luck next time, Space.

I heard his ""Beyond The Sea"" was a better effort...

7872305,3,6304455984,"There are some movies out there that, in my opinion, exist to give us faith in the movie industry.  After years and years of main stream fluff (a family friendly term) and the shear lack of creativity in Hollywood, you lose your desire to see good films or just become numb to them.  However, the channels like IFC, PBS, TCM, and Sundance keep our eyes, ears, and hearts open to good film making and new ventures.  One such film is 1996's Albino Alligator, a caper/hostage flick by Kevin Spacey that doesn't break any new film making grounds but delivers a host of good performances amid an uneven flow.

Albino Alligator is the story of three crooks, Dova (Matt Dillion), his brother Milo (Gary Sinies), and Law (William Fichtner) who, after a botched robbery attempt, are pinned in a old bar by the ATF and police in New Orleans.  Through simultaneous story telling, we learn that the ATF has surrounded the bar in attempt to capture a gun smuggler.  Through a series of miscues and circumstance, the tension builds between patrons of the bar and the crooks as well as the ATF and local media till in ends in a violent and unexpected end.  Look for good performances from, Faye Dunaway, Viggo Mortensen, M.Emmet Walsh, Skeet Ulrich, John Spencer, and Joe Mantegna.

When watching Albion Alligator, you have to be in the mood for heavy drama and angst, because this movie can't really deliver anything else  This film has a few, brief scenes of action, but is mainly a film about the characters, and in that respect, the film does a decent job.  The budding angst in the bar is well played and acted.  None of the actors over play their parts and allow the scene to play out.  Matt Dillion's Dova and William Fichtner's Law are the highlights of the films acting.  Fichtner's Law is a very bad man among other bad men.  He oozes greasiness and seems lower than the proverbial snake in the grass all the while losing his emotional grasp on the situation.  In contrast, Dillion's Dova is like the naive child thinking they know the way things work in the world until it's all turned on its ear and he can't handle the responsibility on his shoulders.  These two performances carry this film far and without them, this film would hardly be worth the look.

Kevin Spacey's direction is nothing special with nothing really standing out but then again, this is movie reads like a stage play with only a handful of set pieces and doesn't require a unique vision in direction, just someone to keep the actors in moment while in front of the camera.  The film's unevenness is its biggest handicap and keeps this film from being a cult hit.  Unlike other dialogue heavy features ala Glenngary Glen Ross (Kevin Spacey co-started), this movie has moments of directionless dialogue that could have been cut to tighten up the film and keep the tension up.  In the end, this is a good movie to watch if you see it floating around, otherwise, rent the previously mentioned Glenngary Glen Ross to watch a dialogue drama at its best.",1195948800,2,3016,4.633458646616542
