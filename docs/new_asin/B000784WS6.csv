2203985,5,B000784WS6,"I'm so excited that this film is getting a proper dvd release.  Believe the hype.  This was the most brutal, unrelenting, horrific, deeply moving film I have ever seen.  A complete work of genius.  I saw this film during its brief theatrical run in the fall of '04 and have not been able to forget it since.  I had heard that the violence and gore was over the top (as is usual for Jim Vanbebber's films) but that is an understatement.

Not only that, but it is so painstakingly filmed and edited to give it a ""documentary"" feel that it looks like real footage of the actual family members themselves.  Succeeds in demystifing the myth of Charles Manson and his ""family"" members.  Absolutely awesome, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Every fan of explicit horror should see this movie.",1110758400,9,794,4.535211267605634
2203986,5,B000784WS6,"I saw this film months ago on a east european release.  The film has been trying to get distribution and finished for some time so I grabbed the opportunity to watch it.  Van Bebber has done a stirling job in capturing the Manson phenomena and has created a unique,chilling and satisfying cinema experience.  The film is influenced by 60's trip cinema, inevitable to reflect the times that these horrendous crimes were committed. The budget that Bebber was working to adds to the creativity of the flick and builds more atmosphere than a thousand big budget productions.  The murders are presented graphically without compromise which further illustrates the extent these people had become removed from their earlier hippy pretensions to savage merciless murderers.  Very well shot and edited the film will not appeal to everyone as it does not follow a traditional linear narrative.  The documentary feel of the film works well which further replicates the heavy media association that the crimes originally had.  The Manson trial was the end of the summer of love and I think Bebber illustrates this by the film at the end catching fire which is very similar to Two Lane Blacktop a film which also symbolised the end of the sixties.  A truly original piece of cinema which will appeal to cinephiles with a wide ranging knowledge of films and the crimes themselves. Everybody has a right to an opinion but the reveiwer who gave this film one star is not saying anything in his reveiw but the fact that he needs to get back to his Troma films.  This film is well worth a watch and you well get a lot out of it subtle references to Jim Jones, the celebrity status killers receive through the media.  Highly recommended.",1109030400,14,1718,4.793220338983051
2203987,5,B000784WS6,"This movie is certenly not for everybody but many people really like it. Maybe it's because it is a true story about a horrendeaus events. the amaturish acting just adds to the realness and rawness of the film.

It starts with life on the Spahn Ranch as told by Sadie, Pat and Tex, the main killers who are talking to an interviewer through prison. The film builds up and leads us through sex orgies and devilo worship untill things are getting paranoid and crazy. Then it explodes in your face with that climatic violance which is so graphic and horrible.

I watched this film with my father and both of us felt really nervus after the film and I was afraid to leave any windows open. I was laying in bed not able to fall asleep, waiting for drugged out, crazed hippies to burge into my bedroom and drag me out of bed and start by viciously stabbing me again and again. It was horrible.

This film is really good and it shows it like it was and what those terrified victims went through and how crazy things went. This film is bound to leave some people outraged, scared, exited and others simply bored. In my opinion this is splatter cinema at it's best.",1108944000,15,1156,4.392523364485982
2203988,1,B000784WS6,"I heard legends about this ""film"" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I impatiently started watching it. By the end, I *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.

This may be the worst film I've even ""touched"" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. ""Manson Family"" makes the bottom of Troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork. I could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a ""plot"" it has, the revoltingly bad ""acting"", the painful, inept ""directing"", the sets and props with their ""dollar ninety nine"" look (I especially ""loved"" the plastic toy guns used in the Tate murder scene!) or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage (I think it was supposed to represent a drug-induced hallucination; I have absolutely no idea how a drug-induced hallucination looks or feels, nor do I want to find out - but I guess drug junkies may love this ""film"" (they seem to be the ones who made it.) I've seen many films from various ""Worst 50"" lists, traditionally opened by Eddie Wood's ones - and Eddie Wood would be appalled by the sheer ineptitude and talentless of van Webber (or whatever his name is; I certainly don't want to remember it) Van Wossname's ""Manson"" belongs on the IMDB's ""Bottom 100"" list next to Hal Warren's ""Manos"".",1107561600,10,1460,4.593869731800766

2204112,1,B000784WS6,"Absolute garbage. Poorly made, the acting was terrible, it was an incredibly disgusting movie that would make the Family themselves look decent. It's mostly scenes of nudity and sex, or ridiculous Satanic worshiping crap. In fact, there was even a scene where a dog's throat was cut. (Spoiler, but you'll be glad I let you in on that one). Whatever you do, DON'T waste your money on this. Hell, DON'T watch it even if you get it for FREE. Among the numerous inaccuracies and flaws, the actors look absolutely NOTHING like their characters; the clothing and hair styles are CLEARLY from the 90's, not the 60's, so that in itself makes it hard to take the film seriously. There's a group of Satan worshiping freaks in the beginning and end of film (that have no relevance to the Manson Family's story at ALL) that are disturbing and disgusting. (A dildo painted like an American flag; need I say more?). The story is supposed to look like numerous interviews with the Family members during their incarcerations, flashing back to THEIR version of events, but it's all just too much crap to even digest. It seriously makes the real story seem TAME. I suppose if you were tripping on acid or high on green, you might be able to hack this piece of junk, but otherwise, NO....just....NO. Consider this review and the fact I watched this ""movie"" a sacrifice for all humanity; I hope I can save the rest of you the disturbing, nonsensical dribble that I just endured for nearly two hours. It's an underground film for a reason, and in spite of its description on Google, it's not now, nor will it EVER be a ""cult classic"". It's borderline porn and animal abuse combined in one film, and how it ever made it to VHS or DVD, I don't know. The producer and directors should be ashamed of themselves. I'm a big fan of horror movies, but this is too messed up for even my morbid tastes. That says it all. Plus, it's utterly stupid on every conceivable level. Run as far away from this crap as you can.

It advertised we would see all this new information about The family and the crimes,  but I heard and saw nothing I didn't already know. I was 19 and adored Sharon Tate in August 1969, I actually heard the news on my radio while traveling in Colorado. I think the early head lines talking about dope, murder lists, satanic rituals, and such were probably true. I always thought Vince pulled Helter Skelter out of his butt, it did serve the purpose to get Charlie off the streets and he got rich and famous. My only regret is Rose Bird abolishing the death penalty as they deserved to die for their crimes. I just changed my mind I'm giving it another star  because I do remember I had never thought about  the overkill, until actually viewing it .It was horrific but it  drove home the terror those poor people suffered.

Van Bebber and company did a spectacular job in displaying what life might have been like within the Manson family community and as accurately as possible showing the how and why the crimes were committed. It plays out as a psychedelic pseudo docudrama with great acting and great script. The film also has a 70ish true grindhouse feel which helped as it took the viewer back to the days of free love and flower power of the late sixties. the print was a work in progress as the Director took the film to various film festivals until the director finally felt he had a good cut of the film. Well, good became great as this film has attained a cult following. Phil Anselmo (The voice of Satan)is featuring the film at the Housecore Horror film festival.

2204137,4,B000784WS6,"Jim Van Bebber crafted an unheralded classic with ""Deadbeat at Dawn"" back in the 80s, and here with ""The Manson Family"", he's nearly done it again.  Beginning production towards the end of the 80s and shot sporadically throughout the years until 2003, ""The Manson Family"" is an uncompromising, graphic, and unforgettable take on the notorious Charles Manson and his group of followers.  Shot in a pseudo-documentary style and reminiscent of a news program expose', and featuring a cast of mostly amateur actors (who are all close to perfect in their roles), ""The Manson Family"" is strangely magnetic nonetheless, and despite its otherwise off-putting content, you can't help but keep watching.  I'm glad that Severin Films released this handsome Blu-ray set of the film, featuring a horde of special features including an insightful commentary from Van Bebber and an interview with Pantera and DOWN frontman Phil Anselmo (who helped provide music and is fittingly the voice of Satan in the film).

But the truth is, as horrible as this it may be, this is one of the best horror movies ever!!!

THE MANSON FAMILY may not be the perfect film, but it is definitly irresistable. The whole movie makes you feel like your on drugs and watching a music video of death. Jim VanBebber deserves the most respect of any filmmaker because he worked for more than 15 years on this movie! That's almost unheard of.

This movie focuses more on the family than just Charlie, because the ""family"" were the real killers. For once, a movie tells the story in brutally honest detail, there is no clever editing techniques to let you imagine everything that is happening, it's all right there on screen from a few trippy hippies, to a bloody orgy, to the most grusome crimes America has ever seen.

Also, the movie cuts to present times throughout showing the modern kids who idolize the family...very creepy stuff that will scar your mind!!!

They started it in the late 80s, ran out of funds and took a long time to get it done. The acting is pretty amateurish, but then the actors were playing Manson's cast of 60s druggies and burnouts and are actually probably pretty close to the real flavor of the actual people involved. Manson himself is well done. Much nudity and crude violence. I was grateful that much of the stabbing and mutilating was depicted with such fake looking dummies. Otherwise, this would have been nauseating. I didn't know the background of the Manson family and this does a good job on the long lead-up to the famous Tate murders. They tack on a modern appendage of some 90s looking Goth kids murdering some modern TV producers. I wasn't sure what the point was.

I did like the deliberate use of grain in the film to make it look like real news footage, and the switching back and forth from latter day interviews to the time of the killings was sort of effective.

I thought that it was a normal movie, but the best way to describe it is to say that it's not even a movie, it's just insanity! It doesn't really have a plot, most of the times you just see random bits of the Manson family's life, mostly them being naked (lots and lots of big tits), having orgies (one time while drinking dog blood and it's pretty disturbing), being high on acid and killing people in gory ways (the last 20 minutes or so are very gory!)! The other times you see them (the actors, not the real persons) a couple of years later talking about how life with Charles Manson was and there's a subplot taking places in the present about teens or young adults who worship Charles Manson and wants to be just like the Manson's family. The whole thing is really out of the ordinary and stylish and sometimes you almost feel like you're high on acid! I'm sure that it's far from accurate, but some parts are accurate.

2204146,4,B000784WS6,"If you don't believe me then compare The Manson Family to any of those serial killer/crime films produced by Tartan Video and you'll see the difference.

Those films have absolutely no filmmaking style.  You get basic editing, basic camera work and no evidence the filmmaker has any signature style at all.

The Manson Family is visually a dazzling film and it's disjointed chaotic look goes along way in helping depict the insanity which enveloped the family members during the times leading up to those two horrible nights in 1969.

Jim Van Bebber probably spent alot of time studying Robert Hendrickson's 1973 documentary Manson.  He apes the psychedelic feel of that movie and actually quotes scenes and words from that film when he shows the girls on the garbage runs and also Lyn Fromme and Sandra Good sitting on the table with guns saying that ""snitches will be taken care of""

Van Bebber also appears to have taken some cues from Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (a film that features Manson as an inspiration to Mickey & Mallory) in regards to the directors usage of quick cut montage scenes interspersing images from the past, future, ""stock"" and ""newsreel"" footage as well as interviews with the protagonists.

The result of all this is a very effective film which does a better job than any other film (including any real life documentary) of depicting the Manson Family and their continuing fascination for so many people today.

The film reaches greatness in the mock documentary parts framed by present day interviews of the family members in prison each giving their own, often contrasting views on the events and who did what exactly.

The film is less successful in some of the more drawn out scenes where the lack of budget and inexperienced actors become more of a liability.  The present day scenes with the industrial junkie kids are confusing at first but by the end I understood why Van Bebber included them in the movie and they made total sense.

Also, with the 2 disk edition you get two fascinating documentaries which are must viewing for anyone interested in independent filmmaking.

If you slit someones throat they are not going to colapse and then get back up and walk out to the front yard before they die after loosing what seemed to be a couple gallons of blood. The stabbing of most of the bodies is just stupid considering that Jay was shot once and stabbed 7 times but in this movie I swear that Tex stabbed him 50 times, Parent was only shot not cut according to published autopsy reports and to stab a person in the same place so many times like Hinman when the autopsy report clearly does not depict that is crazy. To top it off to put in your updates that the US Supreme Court abolished the death penalty when it was the California SC under Rose Byrd in 1972 just goes to prove how stupid this director/producer is. If the movie was claiming to be just for entertainment fine. But when you depict it as accurate and from the view of the family you look like a damn idiot.

2204158,5,B000784WS6,"Conventional wisdom about the Manson family: Charlie the madman took a bunch of innocent young drifters in 1969 and fed them mountins of
L S D. He was able to convince them of the nobility of his plans, and the girls commited the Tate-Labianca murders on his orders that August.

This has been the story line since LA District Atternoy Vincent Bolgiosi tried the case in 1970 and got convictions. And it made sense--Manson masterminded these killings but the girls carried them out. Bolgisoi needed to prove a conspirisy to convict Manson.

The Manson Family, this film, has a different theroy. These girls were sadistic little wenches to begin with, and the sex and drugs and nonsence 60s rap Charlie fed them only fuled their sociopatic impules. Further, the August killings were not just spawned by hippie underbelly madness. Before Tate Labianca, Manson had killed a Black Panther in a money deal gone wrong, and the murders that summer were part of a scheme to throw authorites off the trail. According to the film, the family also gang raped the wife of the land owner where they had set up camp.

Taken at face value, this changes the implications of the Tate-Labianca butchery. If the family can be seen more as a criminal enterprise then a mystified hippie cult, the real cruelity of their crimes can be viewed in a much starker light.

But director Jim Van Beeber takes this a step further: the film also deals with the Manson acolytes who continued to follow him into the 90s. Here, these young killers in punk rock drag kill a TV reporter working on a documentry about Manson. This reporter summerizes the point of the film, early, saying 'It is all Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. What about the kids who put  the knives in the victims.""

During these 90s scenes, there is virtually no dialouge between the memebrs of the Manson posee. Implied is that there is little thought put behind their worship of Manson  or their own crimes. Their criminality also seems to feed on freekoid sex, drugs, and out and out wierdness that contains no reason or subtance.

Sixties or Nineties, the Manson Family documents the crimes in graphic, horrific fashion. This is probably the most violent film I have ever seen, and I do not go out of my way to avoid violent movies. But, the violence is not gratuitous- to Vanbeeber's credit,  he uses the gore of the Manson crimes to deflate the icon myth of Manson.

This set also contains a bonus disc on why this film took almost 20 years to get made. The film making process is fascinating, and so are the stories of the actors--who often worked for free to make the film.",1247875200,2,2612,4.671023965141612
2204159,5,B000784WS6,This is the movie that was on TV years ago and not shown to many times. I can remember watching this when I was little. It's hard to believe that people could be brain washed so bad and follow someone like all those people did.

2204160,5,B000784WS6,"I was severly sick with the flu the first time I saw this movie.  Having a really high fever and that ever hoovering feeling of being outside your body and the combination of this movie, wow.
From the Manson girls singing at the beginning to the splices of today's youth and their propensity toward violence this movie caught my attention and dug its dirty claws into it.
I can't say that it is easy to take in or is very light hearted but I appreciate a director that can defy ego and go with their vision instead of what is going to be a blockbuster.  The scenes in this movie are so meticulous that you start to feel the characters are the real characters.  There are some scenes that are so graphic and disturbing but this is truly the way Van Bebber intended it.  We cannot gloss over the nasty parts and pretend they didn't happen.  He wanted to present the mentality of the family.  I think he achieved all that and beyond.
We cannot turn a blind eye to those gruesome details and tuck it all in a neat little package.  To truly be a part of history good or bad there will be things people want to sweep under the carpet.
Van Bebber definitely did his research.  This is a man with total passion.  I didn't have the edition with the interview the first time around.  I purchased the 2 disc special edition.  The interview with Van Bebber makes the movie so much even more amazing for me.  This man worked in fast food and sold blood to make this thing come to life.
I have more respect for Van Bebber than any of the fat cats in hollywood yelling from a chair.  He was also in the movie so he never asked his cast to do anything more disturbing or graphic than he did himself.
This is truly one of the more unique films out there.  You can tell he sealed this movie with his own essence.
A lot of people will be squirmish with the topic of Charles Manson but I think that it is important to show that people weren't under some brain washed spell of Manson.  They came to actions of collaborative effort.  Every other movie or book focuses on the evil of Manson.  Those other people are just as responsible for their own actions.  I love the way this movie puts that into perspective.",1241308800,2,2190,4.2871046228710465

2204167,3,B000784WS6,"In terms of the non-documentary, semi-fictionalized accounts of Charlie Manson and the Family, I'd slot this effort into the middle of the pack. Not the worst, but far from the best. First problem is a decent chunk of the movie concerns a fictional, modern day gang of Nazi punks that are into S & M and are a sort of Manson-worshipping cult. It has nothing to do with anything and is just a waste of screen time. Second is that the movie bounces back and forth through the years with recreations of interviews and dramatizations with no linear through-line, so unless you're very familiar with the case and all the participants, one would be forgiven for being fairly confused at times with who is being portrayed and at what point in time the action is supposed to be taking place. Also, there are factual inconsistencies with what is known and agreed on in the case by both authorities and Family members alike. Granted it is a docu-drama, but at least get the facts straight! There are some graphic sexual depictions at several points of the movie which add little to the overall experience of the film, other than to provide some nudity...although this is not an altogether unwelcome component.",1205193600,3,1199,4.741626794258373
2204178,5,B000784WS6,"The idea of this film is 60 Minutes type interviews of members of the Manson family with the memory flashbacks of the scenes played out like an actual ""Riot on Sunset Strip"" type B-film. The flashback scenes were filmed in the late 80s, the modern day interview scenes were filmed in the late 90s if not in 2000. If you have a look at that or just youtube Something Weird Video and look at their 60s hippy acid flicks you'll see roughly the same thing. The only thing that really hurts this movie is the useless subplot of stereotypical late 90s Columbine-ish kids listening to industrial music, dressing weird plotting to kill. It doesn't help the film at all and really drags it down.
  As corny as this movie can be, if you can view it with a sense of humor you'll find this movie is either pure genius or accidentally good. The older scenes in the movie were pretty much an entirely separate and meant to stand as their own film, Van Bebber waking up from a decade of stagnant alcoholism went back seeing a cheesy movie and worked it into some far more restrained realistic scenes. And I'll repeat myself, a mock TV documentary like musicians reminiscing on Woodstock with mock 60s footage to match.  It works well, its gory and cheesy and trash cinema yes but if you look a bit closer its got a raw power to it. With all these directors trying to ape the old trash cinema style, like Rob Zombie  or take your pick really, Jim Van Bebber actually gathers it together and makes it into art instead of a throwaway night at the movies. And if you're a Deadbeat at Dawn fan this shouldn't disappoint.
  The extras on this disc are very revealing. My personal favorite was this film showing at a horror fest which in my opinion is depressing. I can understand if there were films like Bad Taste or Evil Dead 2 or anything remotely resembling talent but movies like Aftermath, the utterly terrible Dust Devil and some unfinished POS by a ""director"" that starts crying (he's asked some simple direct questions by some critics who just viewed some unedited soundless footage of bad latex/karo syrup effects) is sad sad sad. Jim Van Bebber's film deserved a better wider audience but if he's stuck in cinema ghetto its his own fault. The other documentary shows Van Bebber pretty much falling to pieces after Deadbeat At Dawn filming the first half of this film, then drinking, losing partners, his studio, everything from just drinking. He finally the finishes the movie a decade later, if there's ever been a film to warn against overindulgence of mind altering chemicals its right here! It really had an effect on me, drinking alot myself the time I saw it.

2204179,1,B000784WS6,"First of I have to give Van Bebber credit for the amount of time and patience he put into this production. However:

1) It is for the most part a visual and/or verbal re-enactment of Robert Hendrickson's 1973 ""Manson"", a fantastic Academy Award nominated documentary. Which is not mentioned by beer sipping Van Bebber as an INFLUENCE in the interviews on the bonus disc.

2) I agree, it's hard to make Ohio look like Southern California.

3) What's up with the late 80's hairdues in the 60's scenes?

4) Beware of bad nylon wigs and fake mustaches to make the actors look older.

5) What seemingly egomanic Van Bebber defends as never before seen experimental film making has been done extensively since the early 1960's by film makers such as Kenneth Anger, Andy Warhol...etc.

6) I think one of the reasons as to why the film was not received well in Europe is because the actor playing Manson looks like 1970's Greek pop sensation Demis Roussos who was popular throughout the continent. Image Google him and you might get a laugh or two.

I'd say Troma fans may have a blast with this thing but otherwise forget it. The actual Manson interview on the bonus disc is footage from ""Charles Manson Superstar"".",1194998400,10,1208,4.669811320754717

2204181,4,B000784WS6,"Let's set the record straight first -- this is not a documentary.  What it is, is a sytlized (and artistic) examination of the Manson Family with a story set in the present day.  It's actually almost like three or four films in one.  It's a bad trip that captures your attention from frame one, and it works on multiple levels.

There have been reviews on here that trash this film and its subject matter.  Those reviews are misguided at best.  Sure, this may be an independent film, and therefore not as polished as the trite from major studios, but that fits the Manson saga.  Manson, his followers, and their deeds should never be Hollywoodized (a new word created just for this review).  Gritty stories deserve gritty movies, and that's what you get here.

You can argue all you want about the subject matter and exploitation aspects (which are minimal at best), but you can't argue that the fact that this film is very well done and gets its point across in a way that is hard to forget.

I'm not a Manson expert, fan or even all that interested (though I have the Amok book that I have yet to read and the LP), but this movie intrigued me.  If it bothers people, it should.  A movie about Manson and his followers should not make anyone feel happy about life, but it should get you thinking.

2204187,4,B000784WS6,"I'd say I know about the Manson family/murders about as much as the average person. I know about their victims, their trial, their sentences, and Charlie Manson's CD. But, to tell you the truth, my knowledge about the whole debacle is, in reality, quite small. I've never seen ""Helter Skelter"" or any other movie about Manson...This one intrigued me because it had good reviews on the front (from Roger Ebert & Entertainment Weekly's Owen Glieberman). I want to begin by saying that the film is not 256 minutes, like the back cover said. It doesn't even pass 100 minutes. Anyway, the Helter Skelter movie was told from the lawyer's point-of-view. The Manson Family is meant to be told from the eyes of The Manson Family. Instead of just presenting it, it is set up as a producer splicing together interviews to create a Manson documentary. While these interviews play, we get glimpses into the life of Manson. Nothing really new. Charlie Manson, an aspiring musician and convict, got some followers to hang out with him at his ranch. They'd take drugs and have sex as often as possible, while all looking up to Manson as a heavenly figure. Eventually, he convinces them to commit murder (although they actually kill a black man first) which leads to the Tate-LaBianca killings. There are a lot of problems with the movie. One of them is that almost the entire movie is too damn campy. None of the scenes that take place at The Ranch creeped me out or disturbed me at all. I didn't laugh at any point during the movie, but I found a lot of scenes laughable. There's also a ridiculous sub-plot about a bunch of Manson worshipping kids, who are plotting to kill the producer that's viewing the interview footage. The most effective scenes come from the Tate-LaBianca killing scenes. They are truly horrifying to watch, especially when the woman supposed to be Sharon Tate begs for the life of her baby. The movie is told like a documentary and has cinematography that gives it a look of a 1970s movie. I mean, it doesn't even look purposefully done that way. It looks very 70s-ish. This makes those scenes more effective. Another thing that led to the downfall was the producer and the Manson worshippers. If this movie had been solely about The Manson Family, cutting all that other stuff out, even with the camp left in...This would've been a better film. I was tempted to give it 4 stars, but I'm going to give it 3 (well 3 1/2)...I did find those murder scenes disturbing and haunting. The acting is good, but the actors (since they are playing drug users) do way too much overacting. I even thought the guy playing Manson was overacting, until I watched the Charlie Manson interview on the 2nd disc where I realize that the actor is sedated compared to the real Manson. The interview is interesting though. There's one last problem with this film I wanted to point out. I usually don't even care about something like this, but in this film it bothered me. Most films that deal with this subject matter try to present a reason why these people would do something like this. This film seems to just want to exploit the fact that it happened. It tries to pin the reason on LSD, marijuana, and brainwashing...But that seems like an easy way out. I don't think anyone can truly pin down what occurred at that ranch to make these people do what they did, but the writer/director could have at least attempted a character study to get into the psyche of these characters. It doesn't even seem like this goal was in his mind. This is not a film I would watch again. I, personally, don't know why anyone would want to submit themselves to this again. If you really want to see it that bad, rent it first.

It is brutal and sometimes difficult to watch. I think it shows the b.s. that was Charles Manson and his band of idiots. Van Bebber did an excellent job of researching and getting to the heart of the characters and how they were. He said he never spoke to any of the Manson family cause from what he read they were all full of it and tried to spin it the best way they could to help themselves as individuals. It also delves into the real motivation of the killings which was not about ""Helter Skelter"" and a race war which is a prosecution gimmick to convict Manson but simply and stupidly an attempt to make it seem like Bobby Beausillae did not kill Gary Hinman and to make it look like the real killer/killers were still at large so he could get out of  a murder rap.

The documentary that goes with this movie is as good as the movie. It is an amazing tail of independent film making. This guy Van Bebber was driven to make this work and to make his movie. It took him years and running out of money and then getting the same people together year after year to do another piece of the film.

After viewing the bonus features and learning what a truly torturous ordeal it was for the small ragtag group of filmmakers and actors to complete this film, my hat is off to them. It cannot be said that these people did not suffer for their bloody art. The problem is, as a viewer, I'm not sure that the end result of their labor is worth it. I appreciate that director Jim Van Bebber wanted to tell a powerful story and resolved himself to do whatever it took (literally) to tell his story. The Manson Family is, in fact, 'Jim Van Bebber's Manson Family', not 'The Family' as it really was by most accounts. Having seen countless photos of the people and places involved with the Manson Family murders, I was extremely disappointed that the actors chosen to portray such pivotal roles as Tex Watson, Susan (Sadie) Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkle, and Charles Manson, looked very little like their real world counterparts. Accuracy is the key to believability, but as this film progresses, it becomes profoundly clear that style over substance is the preferred cinematic avenue. As a viewer, there was absolutely nothing in this film that appealed to me to despise these murderers nor feel for the victims.

JVB masterfully re-creates the drug-trippy filmmaking quirks of the 60's and uses these techniques to bring a visually vibrant, hellish storm to the screen.  This unsettling edge, this bloodsplattered, uncontrollable death ride is exactly the tone a movie about America's most infamous cult leader and death bringer should have.  It is respectful to the historical events that inspired the film... and it makes for fascinating cinema.

The only really weak thing about this movie is the acting.  Most of the cast is fantastic and very believable.  Unfortunately, a few bad actors are mixed in here and there.  They do stink up a few scenes, but they do not dilute the overall power this film has.

Be open-minded and give this film a shot.  Very violent, VERY non-PC, and very good... MANSON FAM is absolutely worth your dime and your time.",1120089600,6,1301,4.70353982300885
2204206,5,B000784WS6,"I was sifting through a Best Buy store looking for something strange, and possibly something a bit disturbing when I found this blood soaked little opus staring out at me from the horror section. I had my doubts at first, but I remembered seeing it on the marquees of the local art-houses and reading some reviews so I made the plunge and was not dissappointed.

  Let me stress at the outset that this isn't the highly sanitized 70's television mini-series Helter Skelter nor it's polished remake of last year. This one scratches much closer to the bone. Made on a shoe-string budget on and off over a course of almost fifteen years, this comes across as cross-breed of documentary, Italian horror and snuff-film. The various film stock used conveys perfectly the time period and gives an added reality to everything that eventually unfolds on screen. The use of non-actors (many of which worked pro-bono) works equally well since there is none of the pretense or method a schooled actor would bring to the table.

  Some may be put off at the seemingly disorganized way it all is cut together, but there is a method to the madness. Others may be equally turned off by the exploitation flick vibe that radiates off the screen. However, from all the interviews and books I've read on the case, the film rarely strays from fact. The director Van Bebber did his homework and stayed on course.

  Another thing I think I should mention is the documentary on the making of this movie. Van Bebber deserves a lot of credit for muscling this film to completion. Money ran out, some of the actors grew tired of it and went on their way, including Marcello Games who played Manson himself, but the end result was something one cannot take their eyes from. Any number of other directors would have given it up for dead long before, but eventually he got the deed done. I for one am glad he did.",1119398400,6,1884,4.616766467065868
2204207,4,B000784WS6,"We'll all heard of the atrocities that happened on that fateful night in August 1969 when actress Sharon Tate and her guests were brutally murdered at the hands of crazed fanatics.  Since that night Charles Manson has been reviled (and by some people glorified) as one of the most notorious serial killers in American history.  Most average people, while referring to mass murderers will say his name before almost anyone else, even though body count wise he can't hold a candle to people like John Wayne Gacy or Gary Ridgeway.  Here's a news flash for those not in the know: Manson was not a serial killer.  He wasn't the one who plunged the knives in the bodies of the victims, heck he wasn't even in that house.  While Manson definitely belongs locked safely in a cell for the rest of his days for masterminding the attacks, his rep as a notorious mass murderer is a myth that director Jim Van Bebber tries to demystify in his film The Manson Family, placing the spotlight on the other members of the Manson cult.

The Manson Family is what can be referred to as a &#8220;mockumentary&#8221;, a film told in documentary format except that the people recounting the events are actors and the footage shot is not real but fictitious.  Throughout the movie, we hear testimony from the 5 members of Manson's &#8220;family&#8221;, who have been incarcerated for life for their part in the killings and we watch as they recount events from their past.  We see how they first met Charles, a struggling musician who took them under his wing.  We see how the group would go to a ranch owned by one of Charlie's friends and engage in sex orgys, acid trips and marijuana smoking.  Mostly harmless fun, typical of the love generation.  Then as the movie progresses things take on a darker tone, especially as Manson's recording career suffers backseat after backseat from record producers, he is morphing into a madman.  His hatred for the establishment and for people he judged &#8220;different&#8221; leads him to form Helter Skelter, an operation in which innocent people, such as Tate and her friends were murdered.  Manson believed that the killings would be framed on the Black Panthers, which would result in a race war in which Charlie would be the leader.  Or something like that.  I guess I don't need to tell you that he wasn't the most well-adjusted individual.

Before anyone casts misplaced judgment on this film realize that director Jim Van Bebber is not at all trying to glorify Manson or the killings.  Quite the opposite.  Van Bebber portrays Manson as a desperate loon and his tribe as crazed worshippers while still attempting to place a human face on them.  This is an independent film in the true sense of the word as Van Bebber slaved over nearly 12 years and countless roadblocks of financing and studio rejection along the way.  His picture is gritty, brutal and uncompromising.  If you do not have a very high tolerance for on-screen violence, do not watch this film.  It actually starts off rather innocently and the entire first half of the film contains nothing graphic or disturbing whatsoever, as it concentrates on profiling the group and its members.  As the film builds to a crescendo we are shown in shockingly graphic detail the atrocities and the murders.  We watch as heads get blown off, as cult members stab repeatedly their victims dozens of times over, all the while referring to them as &#8220;pigs&#8221;.  The film hits a crescendo as the killers enter the Sharon Tate mansion and every single scene is displayed in excruciatingly graphic detail.  No details are spared, except for one, the hanging of Sharon Tate's foetus.  In the special features section, Van Bebber, director of &#8220;Deadbeat at Dawn&#8221; and not one usually known for restraint, says that including that scene simply would have been going too far.  I agree.

The only thing that bothered me was how much Charles was put in the background and how he is portrayed as a rather foolish character, one who says nothing of value and who lacks any charisma whatsoever.  I realize VanBebber's intent with the film was to put Manson's &#8220;family&#8221; in the foreground but I at least would have liked to get a glimpse of what made him so seducing as to be able to convince a group of people to buy into Helter Skelter and commit such inhuman acts. Overall, The Manson Family is a well-done and interesting film if you can stand the graphic nature of it.  Emotions will not be spared; you will have a strong reaction whether you think this is a good film or not.",1119139200,6,4569,4.767471410419314
2204218,1,B000784WS6,"I am facinated with this case because I love American history, and this case is a monument in American True Crime. Based on Amazon ratings, I bought ""The Mason Family"" and waited for it excitedly. I guess I just wanted a more ""fly-on-the-wall"" view of the murders. The 2004 TV movie sucked compared the the 1976 one, and I thought this might give a more eye-witness view.

Unfornutaly, I was wrong. There is a very vague, disturbing, real-time story over the actual events, portrayed as a frame story. This outside story is filled with vulgar events that have no bearing on the story we all want to see...the family and the events surrounding the murders. As for the story of the murders, the actors were awful, and the portrayals of the events were way off, if you have researched the case to know what really happened. (Did Abigail Folger get maniacally stabbed in the kitchen, stagger onto the front lawn, and then die?)

I love gore as much as the next person, but this gore was gorey in a comical kind of way. I wanted to be disturbed because the movie took me there. Instead, I felt like I had just read a comic strip about these historic murders.

I was very disappointed by this movie. It was very well done, for an independent filem, Van Bebber. But it didn't reach the level of a person who knows nearly all there is to know about this tragic, facinating story.",1116979200,6,1371,4.497991967871486
2204219,2,B000784WS6,"I watch & read everything I can get my hands on about Charles Manson. Although I might not condone the actions of murder that the Manson Family took part in, I find it to be very interesting to me. This movie is VERY confusing; but just watch it a second time and you will understand it a little better after a second veiwing. You will catch things that you missed before. I own and have read Charlie's autobiography, and I understand him more than the average person. Most look at Charlie as being nothing but a monster, but there is actually a very sensitive and weaker side to the man than most care to look for. I believe that this is the Charlie that this movie was intending to portray, but although he is not 10 foot tall and bulletproof....this movie made Charlie out to be a little feminine, and bubbly man. The actor who portrays Charlie in this movie should not have been chosen. If you are looking for a movie ABOUT Charlie, look elsewhere because he is simply a character in the background in this film. This film focuses more on the other family members, but I understand the reasons for that. Not a terrible movie, however if you are the type of person that sits around watching nothing but blow-em-up action flicks, Matrix type of garbage, comic book movies, or chick flicks....stay away from this film because you will not understand this movie, or enjoy it. I am going to recommend the film ""Helter Skelter 2004, Director's Cut"" to you all instead. The movie ends too early; but it is a great look into the true events and the way the Manson Family lived. Some say that ""Helter Skelter"" is all about the way the prosecutor viewed Charlie; and I will say that is true of the original Helter Skelter film of the 70's, starring Steve Railsback as Charlie. The 2004 film is not so much like that. It is not viewed from Vincent Buliosi's point of view, but from Linda Kasabien's, who actually lived amongst the family, and was there the night of the Tate murders. The two ""Helter Skelter"" movies are more for the person who wants to study and learn more about Charles Manson; whereas ""The Manson Family"" has a satanic feel all the way through the film. The ""gothic"" culture seems to view the Manson family that way, and would probably prefer THIS film, but although Charlie led folks to believe he was Christ, the family did not actually live a satanic lifestyle. The murders were only the tail end of the Manson Family's jouney. There was MUCH more in life that they stood for, and murder was not their original intention. Please read the book ""Manson-In His Own Words, by Charles Manson & Nuel Emmons"". I feel that Jerremy Davies, in this film is the best portrayal of Charles Manson that has ever been performed. But remember, this is just MY opinion. You may feel differently, and I don't tell you NOT to purchase ""The Manson Family"", because I myself own the 2-disc unrated version. Check it out! You may enjoy it, you may not. But you can't knock something, unless you have seen it for yourself and know what you are talking about. ATWA.",1116115200,4,3056,4.528028933092224
2204220,4,B000784WS6,"Despite an ultra low budget and no-name cast, this 1996 independent feature from director Jim Van Bebber nonetheless rates as the most chilling and eerily effective dramatized evocation yet of the the Manson ""family"" and thier shocking 1969 murder spree. Just as in the ""Blair Witch Project"", the viewer will take away only what they bring with them. If you are a  ""slasher"" fan seeking only the visceral thrill of witnessing a gruesome re-enactment of the Tate-LaBianca slayings, that's exactly what you'll get (and you should seek psychiatric help). If you go in prepared to dismiss this as purely exploitative trash, then, yes, you will find plenty of spurting red Karo syrup and gratuitously naked hippy chicks to shake your head disapprovingly and cluck your tongue over. But if you are open-minded and willing to look just below the surface, you will discover intelligent filmmaking at work. In fact, ""The Manson Family"" is much less of an ""exploitation"" film than, say, the higher profile ""Natural Born Killers"". Oliver Stone has gone to great lengths to convince us that his film was a a misunderstood ""media satire"", but Van Bebber makes his point much more economically. Several key scenes in ""The Manson Family"" feature characters literally holding a mirror up to the camera; so perhaps it is not Charles Manson who fascinates us, Van Bebber seems to be saying, but the IDEA of a Charles Manson (or a Hitler, Jim Jones or Osama Bin Laden). What is it, we ask ourselves, that makes an otherwise ""normal"", intelligent person suddenly drop on all fours and merrily follow such misguided messianics into oblivion? This film comes the closest of any I've ever seen in realistically depicting circumstances that might enable this truly frightening type of transformation. DVD notes: The 2-disc version features an excellent doc with director and actor interviews. Some of the stories regarding on-set occurences will creep you out more than the film itself!

2204221,5,B000784WS6,"I purchased a copy of The Manson Family and found the film to be breathtaking. Jim Van Bebber delivers the goods. The film is definitely not for the squeamish. However, the violence that is depicted has a purpose and is never gratuitous. It is there for a reason, showing how ugly and terrible the crimes committed by the Family were. I thought it was a nice touch to show the effects that the horrors of the Family could have on the youth of modern times. Although the Neo-Family were a piece of the fictional wrap-around story, they serve as a cautionary reminder to be mindful of what kids are doing. That's what I got out of the film and I look forward to repeat viewings.",1115164800,9,676,4.416

It's surely not for everyone, but those not afraid to look real horror in the eye will love this movie. In a time when the term, Underground, is as cliched as words like ""alternative"" or ""hardcore"", Vanbebber proves that minuscule budgeted films can be vital and  be as effective as anything done on any budget. I watched the Unrated DVD (natch!) last night and I haven't been able to get it out of my head all day today. This movie is a masterpiece.",1114214400,34,686,4.5772357723577235
2204224,4,B000784WS6,"While it took forever for this film to be finished, the question is if it was worth the wait. My answer is that it was. ""The Manson Family"" is a very interesting view of the events that preceded the infamous killings and how they culminated in the very murders themselves. Using a multiple time phase structure, the film moves back and forth between the past and present of the main characters involved in the murders. This results in a story that tries to show the killers as being ""removed"" from the actual crime, as if they were not really there and they comment on it in the third person. Essentially exactly what they do when going up for parole hearings. The film is very rough, scenes are filled with scratches and other defects that bring a documentary feel to the proceedings, as if the Manson Family themselves were behind the camera. The culmination of the film with the multiple murders presents them in a highly graphic and factual way which is to the benefit of the presentation. While all the talk and posturing was peace and love, to see the horrendous murders truly puts things in perspective. This is a great movie for people into true crime stories and for those looking for a realistic portrayal of the Manson story. The DVD also contains an excellent documentary concerning no budget, renegade filmmaking. This documentary interviews many directors of these types of film and is very insightful into the passions of these people. Other extras include a revealing interview with Manson himself which, if nothing else, indicates why he will die in prison. I would recommend this film to people who are fans of independent filmmakers and true crime stories.",1114128000,46,1675,4.799307958477509
2204225,5,B000784WS6,"This film is a complete tour-de-force of cinematic brilliance.  I have seen this film twice in the theater.  My girlfriend wanted to leave during the movie, but not because it was bad, but because it was so powerful she couldn't handle it!  I forced her to stay and she and I were both totally blown away by the raw energy and authentically unnerving psychosis the film unrelentingly explores.

  Jim Van Bebber is an amazingly talented filmmaker who is unafraid to push the limits of creativity.  To paraphrase Henry Miller's 1931 review of Luis Bunuel's seminal surrealist work ""L'Age D'Or"": ""They should take Jim Van Bebber and crucify him or at least burn him at the stake.  He deserves the greatest reward that man can bestow upon man!""

  If they have room on the cross for two, then they should nail cinematographer and co-producer Mike King up there with him.  His work is spellbindingly savage, poignantly crazed and completely befitting this twisted exploration of demented and depraved 1960s zeitgeist.",1113436800,7,1013,4.964285714285714
