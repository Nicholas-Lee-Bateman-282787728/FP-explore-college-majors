8186592,5,B000OT6V3W,"I have been watching Mexican Gangster Movies for some time, and it is intriguing to find how funny, and bloody these movies can be.  They are pretty much shoot 'em up movies from the time the credits leave the screen.  One of the best is ""Pistoleros Famosos"", with Mario Almada.  He revenges his brothers' death.  This movie has its ups and downs.  It could do a little less with the Makeup of the Motorcycle Gang, but overrall, it is a good movie.  Give it a try.",1263254400,2,464,4.337209302325581
